{"text":"Great food and great beer! Had the pepper bacon cheesebuger the last time I was there and it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the bartender Megan and Nicole. Food is OK, just nothing that would make you go \"wow\". it is a blend between Yard House, Cheesecake Factory and Hillstone."}
{"text":"Went to Thirsty Lion for a business lunch today and just blown away at the service level. I've always thought the food was good - I had the fried chicken sandwich which was awesome and I love the seasoning they use on their fries.   We had a server at the table who took our order promptly, another server brought us our appetizer and filled our drinks, the bartender brought out our beers, the host checked on us after we were sat, and the manager came and dropped off the bill - everyone making sure we enjoyed our experience and upbeat while doing it.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Gilbert a few times but checked out the in Scottsdale for the first time today. The service was outstanding. I saw the manager touch every table in the restaurant - and the place was full.  I go out all the time and you never see that. Food was great, drinks came out properly and everyone was friendly despite being completely full. I love thirsty lion and I think this Scottsdale location might be the best"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this-I have been to Thirsty Lion many many times, I eat lunch here often, dinner as well, and I love their happy hour. I bring many of my friends and family here to try it for the first time and they always leave happy and in love with the place. The staff is insanely friendly and knowledgable, the food is to die for and there is a giant selection of beers to choose from.   However, this last experience I had was ridiculous. I would love to give this place 5 stars of course but I now want to give it 1 after what happened. I'll settle and take one away from the original 5. My husband and I decided to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous. Lunch on the patio at my favorite place...what could go wrong? Well started off great until our \"waitress\" (parentheses because I almost wouldn't call her one.) ruined our day.   We noticed there was a new menu with seasonal items, we asked questions about some of the food and Irene could not tell us a thing. She had to grab the other waitress in the area to tell us. We asked a few more questions and she would have to dart off to the kitchen and bar to find out the answers. She didn't know some of the items on the actual menu either. That's fine, maybe she was new. We tried to forgive her, however she seemed very uninterested in serving our table, that was UNTIL I got up to use the restroom. When I returned found her bent over the table trying to shove her pushup boobs in my husbands face. Trying to be cute and flirty, flipping her hair and giggling. I don't think so hunny. As soon I reached the table she walked away. Sorry to interrupt your conversation with MY husband.  After that as we were eating our food she made a point to bend over directly in front of my husband to clean a table. Normally I wouldn't have said a thing about it except for the fact that her skirt was so short she was giving my husband a free show. Not only that but her purposely turning around and making direct eye contact with him while doing so was very inappropriate. She continued to ignore me the entire time. It was like I was watching her attempt to seduce my husband in front of my own eyes. Both of us were very uncomfortable and finished our food quickly and paid our bill.   I waited up front to try to speak with a manager about what had just occurred but the hosts told me they were in the middle of an interview and might be a few minutes. I decided to write this review in hopes that a manager will read this to see what kind of trash they now have on their staff. Like I said, I frequent this restaurant very often and usually leave happy and full of good food and beer. This time I left upset and full of disgust and anger.  I love Thirsty Lion and would recommend it to everyone, just make sure you request anyone but IRENE."}
{"text":"We came on a busy Friday night and the service just couldn't quite keep up.  But, that said, everyone enjoyed their food.  I thought the appetizer and meal servings during our dinner were smaller quantities than anticipated.  I've had their burgers before and wasn't wow'd so I went veggie this time and got the Quinoa & Black Bean Veggie Burger, which was good, it just came apart.  But it was yummy.  And even though it's a veggie option, they still killed it with a knife presented directly in the middle :)  The idea of outdoor seating is nice but I think indoors is better. Less view of traffic and headlights.  Good amount of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs."}
{"text":"We were so excited that a Thirsty Lion was going to be in our neighborhood. We made a reservation for Mother's Day at 6:00.   We knew going in that this was their 6th day of operations and expected some opening glitches....but didn't expect what we got. We knew that Mother's Day would be a challenge just because that is a popular day.  First thing they were out of was bourbon (What?Why?How?) and the waitresses excuse was they had a busy opening week. Then the item that we came here for which is our favorite at the other locations are the Scottish Eggs, and they were out!! Ruined my Mother's Day. You couldn't go to the grocery store and buy some eggs and sausage. So my second option was Edamame. Struck out there too. She said they were out of most of the appetizers. So we opted for the pretzels and the disgusting, tasteless cheese that it came with and an order of the Calamari which was okay. From making drinks not as ordered, slow service and out of food I am only giving them one star. The reason being that I think the management screwed up. They have to know that all their other restaurants are always busy and this should have been no exception. Especially for opening week they should've had double the amount of supplies needed. I would be totally embarrassed if I was management. And I feel sorry for the waitresses that have to relay that they don't have certain items. Especially when you're known for them. I will go back to this location at a later date and I will review it again to see if it improves.  If not I guess I'll be driving to Tempe."}
{"text":"This is a service review only.  My date chose this restaurant because they have the beer he enjoys.  We arrived for our dinner reservation about 25 minutes early.  I had requested a booth.  They seated us at booth \"41\".  After about a 20 minute wait and nobody acknowledging us, or taking our drink order, we flagged down a waiter.  He said it was not his area but he would take our drink order.  A few minutes later our beers arrived.  My date's beer was the wrong color, so he knew it was not what he ordered.  We again flagged down who we thought might have been manager.  He said that beer comes in two flavors, so he took that one away and our waiter returned with the correct beer and an apology.  He said he should have asked which one, since they have two kinds of that same brand.  Sometime after we had started to drink our beers the waiter came back to take our order.  We started with the Scotch Eggs, which are amazing!  Soon after that we ordered our meals.  My date ordered the Green Chili Chicken Sandwich and I had the Grilled Veggie Panini.  When our meals arrived his looked fine, but mine was wrong.  So we once again we flagged down the waiter to make the corrections on my meal.  He promptly brought back my correct meal and an apology, again.  After we finished our meal we sat there for quite awhile to enjoy the various sports games on the tv's.  So when we were ready for our bill...shocker it as wrong.  They had not removed the first incorrect beer from our tab.  So, you guessed it, had to get the waiter back.  He corrected it and returned to us for payment, I must say that I was shocked that they had not COMPED us anything for all the errors make by them.  So to recap.  We had at least four different staff helping us throughout the night. they were understaffed for a Saturday night and our waiter \"Ryan\" we think that was his name did his best.   We will go back, but maybe we'll sit where we could be seen."}
{"text":"Went there today cause hubby really likes their nachos. Got seated and waited for good 10 mins and walked out without even being served at all(no one came to even offer a water). Was the first time happened to us and we are totally upset. We told the hostess that nobody served us so were just going to other restaurant. We ended up having dinner at Gordon Biersch instead."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when I went here, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food is good and fairly reasonably priced.  The beer selection is pretty good. Most of the servers are extremely friendly and efficient, which adds a really nice touch.  Unfortunately, the restaurant was understaffed during the one Friday night I was there- all but one server still did really well under the pressure (a grouchy bartender was the exception).  It's not my favorite pub food, but it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"We went to the Thirsty Lion for the first time on Saturday night. Having visited Maria-Maria prior, I liked what the Lion had done with the place. We were seated at a 6-top in the bar and immediately received service.  Thirsty Lion automatically got a good grade for me for having Rogue Hazelnut Brown on the menu. This is a personal favorite of mine. While the Lion brags of 52 taps, most of the beers are the familiar ones you will know if you like craft beer. There are a couple different types thrown in which is nice so you can try something new.  We ordered the Grilled Pear & Prosciutto flatbread appetizer based on the server's recommendation. It was delicious, but if there was pear anywhere on it, it wasn't on the pieces I had. Also, $9 is steep for an appetizer that size.  I ordered the Smoked Turkey Club for dinner with the Beer Cheese soup substituted ($1 upcharge) for the fries. The sandwich was fantastic - I will be getting this again! The soup was ok, nothing special. I'd skip it next time.  My husband got the Newcastle BBQ Chicken Pizza (added jalapenos) which was terrific. Dare I say it... even better than CPK's BBQ Chicken Pizza!? The crust for the pizza and flatbread is excellent.  The other choices for the evening for our party were: Pepper Bacon Cheese Burger (good), Chipotle Mac & Cheese (excellent! Restored my friends belief in getting mac & cheese from restaurants), and the Grilled Veggie Panini (good).  The service we received was excellent and our server obviously knew her stuff. We didn't have any questions about the beer selection as we were all familiar with the choices on their menu, but she was very knowledgeable about the best things on the menu.  Overall, good food, good beer selection, good service, prices are a little steep. ($6 for a 16oz beer!)"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked up to the bar the bar tender came over and was immediately very rude. He rejected my id and made us move away from the bar. He then looked at my friends Id and said this is not you even though we had her sister with the same last name at the table. He continued to be very rude and did not offer an apology for his mistake, nor did he engage in any sort of conversation."}
{"text":"My pulled pork sandwich and fries where delicious! Our server was very professional and courteous. Our food took a little longer than I wanted but the manger was quick to bring us food and make sure we didn't need anything else. I felt this place very family friendly, will come again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food, great drink options, fantastic service! Love the Moscow Mule and their craft beer options! The edamame appetizer is delish! If your really hungry the Corned Beef and Cabbage is amazing. Tv's everywhere. Great place for a nice dinner or to watch a game, and convenient in Tempe Marketplace. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, walked in on a Saturday an they said 10 min wait...ok no problem. While waiting I see 9 open tables, 4 more un bussed...and 3 girls working as hostesses...ummm whos in charge here to see that this is a problem. You dont make people wait for no reason when you have empty clean tables that fit their party!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Sat at the bar with my friend. We were planning on a few drinks and long spaced out courses. Instead our first course and main were rushed. Almost arriving at the same time. We split a Cuban sandwich  which the meat seemed old. The grilled artichoke appetizer was very  good. My friend's wine was old as well. Guess Monday is not a great day to visit."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are ok, but there's better around town. The service was pretty bad. The image given at first from the hosts was really bad. It seems like they're doing you a favor by sitting you at a table. Seemed like rocket science for them trying to figure out where to sit people when the restaurant and bar were at less than half seating capacity during Happy Hour. On top of that, their attitude towards guests was not very welcoming. The waiter was not much better, but saved the place to a 2 star instead of a 1 star review."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Most of the bartenders are outgoing and seem genuinely caring.  They also have a ton of great beers on tap.  They did make a mistake once and misinformed me that they had the TV channel for a soccer game I wanted to watch the next night though.   Yet upon realizing their error they immediately upgraded their cable package to assure I wasn't inconvenienced. This impressed me.  I've returned several times and last night a manager named Yusiel saw me as I walked in and turned my game on for me right away.  That's service that deserves to be rewarded!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not ready to be in business.. the service is horable. The whole reason for a appetizer is to get it before the meal. Don't come and tell me that you gave my food to another table on accident and still go on about ur day. Nope not happy one bit."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience.  Our server, Holly, was very attentive and helpful.  It was crowded on a Thursday, so be ready for a wait.  Our appetizer did not make it out until after our entrees, so it seems there's still some issues they've got to figure out.  But even so, Holly and two other employees (Managers?) came to our table to apologize, comp the appetizer and give us a coupon for  a free appetizer next time.  Food was very good and I appreciate the recognition of the mistake and how they handled it.  I'll gladly go back.  They do need to get MLB as the Diamondback game wasn't available on any of the TVs."}
{"text":"Had a nice time eating lunch on the patio.  Great beer selection.  The steak salad was great and so was the corned beef and cabbage that I stole off my wife's plate."}
{"text":"Been to the Tempe location so I checked the reviews on this new Scottsdale location. Honesty this location is way better food than the Tempe location in my opinion. Service was great and a good place for sports."}
{"text":"This place is a reliable one for date nights with my wife. It's not always the best, but more often than not, we have an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"4th time here. Always happy but this time not so much. After 30 min wait we inquired about our table. Turns out somehow our # to text was wrong. Could have been hostess or our fault, that's ok. Waiter got our drinks and then we lost him for 20 mins. Big problem when our food arrived. Our requested no onion, no tomato burger had both on it. Manager had delivered it, I asked for another, explained onion allergy. Replacement arrived in a timely manner. The problem was the waiter informed us he could lose his job for not writing it down as a food allergy, we needed to say it was food allergy next time. Manager brought us the new burger where he informed us we need to specify its a food allergy. My thought is why don't you just prepare it as requested. And if it does go wrong, don't make it about yourself. Making my teen daughter feel she did something wrong is not right. To make the evening completely comical our to go bag had a huge hole in the bottom and I had to knot it to put the containers in it. My husband did explain to the waiter his choice of words were wrong.  Instead of paying our $100 bill & tipping 20%, normal would be closer to 30, we should have talked with a manger. I guess I kept expecting the manager to say a sincere apology and not charge us for our 3 beers. Or that 1 burger. Or offer us desert. Something, anything to turn our evening around. Lesson learned, next time I speak up more. $100 is too much to spend for good food but really lousy service."}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places I've ever walked out of.   First I'd like to say that my wife is in a wheelchair, and I only mention this because it takes us a few minutes more to get from place to place.   My wife booked the reservation on another app, and we arrived 8 minuets past our reservation at 12:08 pm. They had already erased our reservation after only 8 minuets?!?! Why? Upscale places we go to wait up to 30 minuets before they cancel their reservations. Canceling ours after 8 minuets is a bit fast. So anyways, they get us to a table pretty quickly, drop off the menu's and we wait..  And wait... .... and wait....  At 12:31 pm we had waited as long as we could. Not one of the 4 servers we saw in our immediate area spoke a word to us. Not one single person said hello to us. No one even tried to get us water while we waited or even said they'd be with us in a few minutes.  This is unacceptable. Twenty plus minuets with out service or even acknowledgment is ridiculous.  When we saw the menu we were kind of excited because the food sounded good. Due to their lack of professionalism, the lack of caring and I believe discrimination against us due to my wife being in a wheelchair, we will Never return and will advise against persons we know to ever visit this place.  I really hope the managers read these reviews, you need to tighten up your service to guests and stop discriminating against people due to appearance or disability. And I am seriously considering making this a more public matter."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately because it wasn't very busy. Then we waited for 10 minutes and asked the hostess when we might see a wait staff. They said they'd send one over but we should order drinks at the bar. What kind of restaurant makes table seated guests order drinks at the bar? 10 minutes later, no wait staff. Several staff saw us but nobody acknowledged is. We had plenty of time to look over the menu before we left to go eat at a real restaurant. The food was standard bar food burgers and fries and a narrow beer selection."}
{"text":"Am I first? Ok, here goes: was invited for a soft opening. its bigger than expected. like 400 seats big. i ordered fish tacos (NOT breaded) the way they should be done. cod (iirc), tossed with chili powder and served soft w/ cabbage. however, my wife was dissapointed in the Waldorf chicken salad, which honestly tasted like cheap hot dogs. Processed chicken? Servers seemed helpful, trying to impress new clientele. food delivery was prompt, service from the bar was quick.   my gripe: if you are going to be trendy and open a \"gastropub\".. you gotta be different.. the 52 taps, many common names,  most patrons will see about 10-12 household names but to the craft beer lover, most the stuff on tap is what you could find anywhere really. I hope that more craft beer lovers come in to demand a better variety, and some seasonal/rare beer. after all, if you are just another mini yardhouse, why would I come in? I know that crescent crown distributes here, and they also distribute for the watering hole, but the latter's selection is world class.. and inside of whole foods, of all places.  food: mine was 3.5 out of 5. tacos were good - salty beans, seemed to be placed in a dish as an afterthought.   hers, 1 out of 5. that salad was a Wreck.   If you are in the area and want to quaff a quick \"mainstream\" craft beer, go for it. Not worth the drive if you are going to pass other craft beer bars like the Watering Hole, Boulders, Papago, Hungry Monk, Cuoco Pazzo, or Yardhouse (meh).  fwiw, during this soft opening you would expect the staff to work through some kinks, so this small review is only geared to help them see my perception of the kinks they could improve.   by all means, try the place if you are in the area. but frankly, it is fitting for the location.. a strip mall with a handful of mediocre restaurants, and not much else. i just cannot see them filling those 400 seats.  fwiw, iirc this is the third place that has tried surviving in that suite. time will tell...."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner last Friday night. They had a fun drink menu and I enjoyed the \"passionate peach\" drink. They also have a decent beer menu. The food was good I had the jalapeño burger. I will defiantly come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is fun every once in a while. They have a great atmosphere, and the bar area is really cool. Service is pretty good, about what you'd expect for a restaurant at Tempe Marketplace.   My only gripe is with the kitchen. First, the prices are a bit high. Again, this is Tempe Marketplace, so I get that. The food, however, suffers from a case of taking itself too seriously. For example, one time we ordered the macaroni and cheese. I don't know what we were expecting, but there were like six cheeses, several herbs, and some kind of peppers in it. It was overwhelming and not as enjoyable. The same for some of the appetizers...you're marketing as an up-scale sports bar, how about something a little less ostentatious than the crazy potato cakes, or the pretzel cheese that literally has ale in it.   Order simple, enjoy the reasonable beer prices and great selection, and move on to a cheaper place if you're looking for somewhere to party."}
{"text":"I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated, to be honest.  I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the \"outside\" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, \"well, there's not a button for it so I don't know.\" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the \"straw that broke the camel's back\" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.  We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us. I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot."}
{"text":"Come here all the time with my girlfriend and have never been disappointed. Great food and great service every time! Whether we are wanting just a few drinks or to celebrate a special occasion, this is usually one of our top choices. We strongly recommend giving this establishment a try; you'll be happy you did! Keep it up Thirsty Lion!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance for a sports bar.  Not too loud during lunch hour.  They also offer wifi, so you can get your work done during lunch.   I ordered the Ruben Sandwich and it was excellent!   One of the top 3 I've ever had!  Rye was toasted just right, corn beef was flavorful and tender (not tuff like some places) and not too much dressing to overwhelm flavor, but just to enhance.   Service was great!  Host sat me near a location with an outlet for my laptop.   She was very cheerful and kind.  Server was very attentive and helpful.  Food was quick.  It wasn't very busy when I went in there.  But would definitely head back there if in area.  For a sports bar/restaurant,  a real winner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I never make it out to the Fashion Mall, but when I do I always stop at Thirsty Lion for a martini and some happy hour. Their martinis, especially the Grapefruit Basil or (Dirty Martini) are made perfectly. Their happy hour prices are reasonable for Scottsdale and their portions are perfect for sharing. Management team and the staff go over and beyond with service. First impression, they shook my hand, told me their name, asked me mine and sent the manager over to say hello. It was such a nice experience. Besides the great food and service, little details are so important. They have name cards at the bar so you don't forget the bartenders name, on the flip side is your name and drink. Extra details do count. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for trivia last night and the place was pretty slammed and we ended up outside the room where trivia was being held in an awkward lean over the bar and try to hear area. We had two high tops pushed together and the rest of the group was at the bar. It made for interesting relay of the question/answer. The bartender seemed really nice- but for the people at the high top, we really didn't get service unless we got pushy about it or got up to get it. It would have been really nice if a waitress would have helped up our tables or if the bartender could have relayed with someone to make it happen, but alas it did not. So I just had one beer when I would have ordered more and didn't order food. You wait so long to order then you just get frustrated and don't want to spend your money there anyway. I stopped somewhere else on my way home for a tasty burger (not my first choice- the pizza looked yummy). Shame- I wasn't the only one at the table who under ordered because of the snafu."}
{"text":"Had a blast catching up with some fun friends!  Shout out Breanna for the amazing service! #getoverit"}
{"text":"Wow!  First time here.  Great menu of items not typical of chain restaurants.   Cassy had the seared ahi tuna and I am not a huge fan of tina however this time I tried it and it was outstanding!   I had the sausage and prosciutto Flatbread and it was great as well.  I liked the melding of flavors of the prosciutto with the sliced pepperacini and goat cheese and sausage.  The only minor issue could be that the prosciutto was overpowered by the rest of the toppings.  The crust was nicely done and crunchy.  We'll be back for their bacon wrapped prawns and their outstanding happy hour specials.  We've found a new place!  You should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I liked some of the British items on the menus that you don't see every where. But, the quality of the food is inconsistent. I had the best onion ring I have ever had there, and the worst onion ring I have ever had there at a different night.   Drink was okay. Services was okay.   Not to eager to return, but am not opposing to the idea of hanging out with friends there again. Just A-Ok~"}
{"text":"Lots of open tables, still waited 30 minutes.   Couldn't get a beer at the bar while I was waiting because they were overwhelmed.  Service was slow, order was wrong, plates were too small.  Overpriced, and service staff was unexperienced.   Salad was clearly made many hours before I received it.  Menu looks good but overpromised, overpriced, and underdelivered.  Too bad, they recently opened at San Tan Village and people were clearly excited to get in, so many turned away.  If they had staffed right they could have printed money.   Will not come back for a while until they get it straight."}
{"text":"Great food. My wife had the Romano crusted chicken and it was absolutely delicious. I had the roasted beet salad and it was awesome.  Great place to eat !"}
{"text":"We've been going to Thirsty Lion for about  6 months, now. The service entirely depends on whether or not the waiter/waitress gives a sh**! Some have been incredibile, others, not so much.  Like they haven't learned how to suck-up to customers, yet. (Just wearing a short skirt doesn't automatically translate into A BIG TIP!) As for the food.  the burgers keep bringing us back! Prepared CONSISTENTLY with care and precision, they are quite tasty!  The meat is obviously of high quality - no fast food burger here. And the french fries are to die for - IF they're fresh! Choices of many beers, unfortunately, unless they are Happy Hour specials, the craft beers (like Mr. Pineapple) are about TWICE the cost of any other B&G! WATCH for the bargains!. Sometimes, the place is almost empty.  Sometimes a zoo.  We've had good luck at 3:00 Happy Hour. Had the flatbread, brick oven pizza once.  It was 'okay', but nothing to cheer about.  The pepperoni was very smoky, but the crust and sauce were meh.  We'll keep coming back for the burgers!"}
{"text":"Despite other reviews, one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. I had the seared scallops, bacon wrapped dates, pear and prosciutto flatbread, and the bacon wrapped prawns. All were delicious! The scallops were full of flavor and not chewy. The bacon wrapped dates had the perfect balance of sweet and savory and were the largest I have ever eaten. The bacon wrapped shrimp had a distinctive smoked flavor that complemented the sweet and tangy sauce with the salty bacon. The prosciutto flatbread was light and well balanced.  Will definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"I went to this location to watch the Army-Navy game last Saturday. Our waitress, Jackie, was wonderful!! Very attentive and gave us great food advice. I had the romano crusted chicken, it had nothing to envy a high end Italian restaurant! The cheesecake was amazing as well. I wasn't as impressed with the location closer to me, but this one checked all my criteria with flying colors!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews - but I had a great night with some girlfriends I had not seen in a while. The Elderflower Mojito was awesome! But by far I love, love the Grilled Pear and Prosciutto flat bread. So good!"}
{"text":"We ate there yesterday for lunch while in the Phoenix area. It was our first time and I have to say it was EXCELLENT! Great selection of beer on draft and our salads were amazing! Service was attentive and there was no wait time to be seated. Highly recommend! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant yesterday. Clean, good food, great drinks, TVs everywhere so no problems in being able to watch a game, service was good (little rough at first but got better quickly).  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went here for a first date on July 4th. The service was fast and friendly. The food was delicious crispy juicy chicken, prefectly cooked vegetables. Great beer and lots of tv and good music. Lots of windows for good lighting. I dont like the booths though. you sink to low for those with bad backs and hips. but definetly would go again for the food and Four Peaks Peach beer!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! As of this writing, I would have to say that it is the best food that I have had in the Phoenix area so far. The prices are very reasonable. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is more like an upscale restaurant than a bar and grill. We have been back several times. Everything that we have tried was truly exemplary. We definitely plan on going back and trying everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing place for friends to hang out. Friday nights are usually packed so I would go a little early and settle down. The waiting staff is absolutely friendly.  The music is flat out amazing. Pulled pork sandwich, and burgers are the best on the menu.   Make sure you have good company, and this is an amazing place for the weekend nights and weekday lunches."}
{"text":"Great place! Everything we have here is great as we always find a reason to come back! Try the Ahi tune! It's not on the menu, but they will make it for you. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Food: It really depends on what you order. Being a pretzel and cheese fan, I have to admit I don't like theirs. However, they serve juicy burgers that I love to get. Their salad portions are relatively small compared to other places, so don't expect it to make you full on an empty stomach.   Drinks: Drinks are alright. They have interesting beers, that I recommend if you're feeling adventurous.  Service: The servers are so friendly. They make me feel like they actually enjoy their job, unlike other places. They are energetic and definitely deliver excellent customer service from my experience.  Ambience: Casual. It's a great place for friends/family to catch up with each other. There are a ton of TVs for guests to watch their chosen sport.  Overall, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after walking by a few times at Fashion Square. The hostess was friendly and we were seated quickly. The restaurant looks cool and our server was fine, the service is overall good but unremarkable. The food is the low point, we had the fish and chips and the margherita pizza. The fish was OK, the fries are quite tasty. The pizza is pretty bad, it tasted like a slightly warm caprese salad on a crust. The Thirsty Lion is not terrible, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Beau, Bree, Randi, and Smantha were super accompanying. We had a great time and we owe it all to these people!!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the service truly is hit or miss. We were waited on twice. Once to get food, once to actually get our food. My party had to find another waitress other than our own to go find OUR waitress so we could get drink refills after we has finished our meal. Not impressed with the service.  The food was good, but nothing to rave about. Average priced for the shopping area. The meat on the Kung Pao chicken seemed a little lackluster compared to other places I've eaten the same meal at. The chicken was a little chewy, the rice was strangely sweet which I'm bot really complaining about but it was a surprise for the plate... But the veggies were good.  Ambiance was nice for a real \"pub\" experience to an extent."}
{"text":"I have been to Thirsty Lion several times (most recently yesterday for lunch) and the service, food and atmosphere is amazing. Everyone starting from the hostess to the waitress was very genuine and nice. The food was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Make. Reservation and enjoy.  Great food and a great atmosphere. Big and open.  Very popular and I can see why."}
{"text":"This place is now my family's go-to for weekend lunches and apparently we are not alone. The restaurant has been packed every time we arrived but the wait has never been more than 5 mins.  Lots of kids and families so it can get pretty loud, but once you taste the food and experience the amazing service you won't even notice the noise.  Everything I have tried here is outstanding.  I swear I almost had an out-of-body experience with the NW Pub Burger.  The staff go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you could need or want, but not in a fakey, I-want-a-big-tip way.  They seem to genuinely like people and their jobs.  I can't wait to go back this weekend!  :)"}
{"text":"Place is still awesome. We went there for some appetizers and cocktails on labor day. Here's what they do well : 1) They are consistent. Every time we visit we get good to great service. Also the food is always done well. 2) They're clean. The place just feels and looks clean. 3) Friendly staff. The staff is always funny and friendly. There's an Australian bar tender (forgive me if I am misplaced the accent, but it sounds very Australian) and he's great. He's friendly and funny, and so is the rest of the staff. 4) Good product. They've got a good selection of beers and liquor. The food is always great for pub fare. In fact, the food is actually quite good. I wish they had chicken wings, but you can't fault a place for sticking to a theme. 5) Price. They have good prices and a great happy hour.  Thirsty Lion and The Keg and probably the only two dinner spots in Tempe Market Place worth visiting."}
{"text":"Overpriced and lousy service!  The food is pretty good but I can't get passed the snobby atmosphere and unfriendly staff.  I've been in here several times and it's always a long wait for a table.  Don't waste your time or money.  You'll have a better experience at Gordon Biersch or Kona Grill."}
{"text":"Great place for a late dinner since many restaurants in Tempe marketplace close at 9pm. The calamari appetizer is great. The margarita is very good too."}
{"text":"Love their carrabean mojito!!!! Me and my guy will usually go to sushi across from them and finish at this place for drinks. It has chill and sort of romantic feeling to it. I have seen people here order things from pizza to sushi ...so i guess they can do it all. I will have to try their food sometime."}
{"text":"OK, so we aren't 30 somethings, but we do enjoy a drink or 2 and a nice dinner and some conversation with one another.  THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR CONVERSATION.  We tried to enjoy a Saturday evening dinner here.  Not possible.  I do have to say, the drinks were OK, the dinner was so --- so, I had scallops, all 4 (FOUR) of them for $19.99 were OK, rice was like I make at home in 5 minutes.  Thankfully my husband had fish and chips and I enjoyed his french fries.  Food OK, nothing special, drinks OK, price OK, service nothing special, but the NOISE, now that was special, ESPECIALLY NOISY.  Forget the crying babies, they can't do much about that, and I understand they are a Mall restaurant, so I understand the families.  Surprisingly, when we went to Z Tejas for a QUIET drink after dinner there were no crying babies, NO LOUD LOUD MUSIC, the TVs were quietly on so we knew what was happening.  So sorry, we loved the Thirsty Lion in Tempe for Happy Hour and lunch, but this is our last visit for dinner at Fashion Square.  Could the LOUD MUSIC wait until after at least maybe 7 PM or 8 PM?????"}
{"text":"Good service, average food.  The onion rings on my husband's burger were chewy, not done all the way, but he said the patty tasted good.  My mom got fish and chips and it was a little too greasy.  My Reuben sandwich was good, not the best I've had but I would order it again.  Average food but a nice place to drink and watch sports."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a happy hour dinner after an afternoon of shopping and was pleasantly surprised. Ordered the peppercorn tri-tip off the seasonal menu, the children sliders off the kids menu, and chicken tenders with soft pretzel from the happy hour menu. The food was all well-prepared and delicious. The seasonal menu had a great mix of delicious cocktails, local beers, and food.  Too many good items to choose from & I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Really?  Tons of vacant tables on patios and at least four vacant inside, close to the hostess stand. We were told there would be at least a twenty minute wait!  We told the hostess/manager (as she identified herself) that a 20 minute wait was unacceptable with so many vacant seats. She replied that servers were not available. She said they were doing the best they could. When i told her to tell the manager that using that excuse was not good enough, she said she was the manager. On previous visits, we have been told not enough help, running out of food and soft drinks, always a wait, always an excuse. What a shame. Good food, nice place, good servers but too many \"We are trying our best.\"  There are plenty of other really good restaurants nearby. Go somewhere else until management manages well!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my husband's birthday on a Saturday night. We made reservations because we heard it gets busy. So glad we did, didn't have to wait and the place was packed.  Food was delicious. I recommend the salmon with risotto and asparagus. My husband had the Tavern Burger and it was huge and he loved it. Our friends had the spicy mac and cheese (huge portion) and the blackened salmon. Everyone loved their dish.   The service was great. Our server recommend a few appetizers and we loved them.  She was very attentive making sure my husband had a great birthday including updating us on the different beers that they serve.  Then came dessert. I recommend sharing as our  Brownies and ice cream was large enough for four of us."}
{"text":"Recently went here with some friends. I love the atmosphere of this place. It is perfect for all ages. The happy hour menu is full of delicious items. They have a wide variety of drinks as well. I'm glad they built one closer to where my family and I live."}
{"text":"Went here a few times, the White cheddar burger is excellent. Seared Ahi Tuna salad was good. They carry local brewery beers.  Waitress each time was on top of it, excellent service. The mojitos were a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner with my girlfriend.   First off, didn't realize how big the place was, had walked by it several times when at Tempe market place but its pretty big, has two full bars. So there are tons of places to sit. Which is nice. The place was rather noisy though, which was one of the only problems. That and it was very dark inside, hard to read the menus if you have anything but perfect eyesight    There menu isn't to big, but its diverse, a little over a full page of food. Their drink selection is really good, a wide variety of beer (over 52 beers on tap according the menu and select bottles/cans) as well as a variety of wines and cocktails.   After ordering our drinks, we ordered an appetizer. We ended up ordering Charcuterie. a nice plate of italian meats, cheese and bread. super tasty. we had ordered our food not long after we ordered our appetizer and after maybe 5 minutes of eating on our appetizer our food came out, super fast on cooking time which is nice, since no one likes to wait for food.   I ended up having the Chipotle mac and cheese, which was amazing, and my girlfriend ended up having the Chicken Penne & Gorgonzola Cream. she liked hers as well but said mine was better.  when the bill came the meals weren't that expensive but the beers were in my opinion way over priced, i ended up drinking Rogue Dead guy ale, which was 8 dollars for 20 oz drink, which to me seems ridiculous. but no biggie because i enjoyed my meal and had a good time,   all in all i definitely will return, the staff was good, the food was tasty and the selection of beer is awesome."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I came in with my brothers for lunch and they did not dissapoint. Very large dining room with plenty of seating options, as well as a large patio. It was a fairly busy weekday lunch and we took a high top right next to the bar. The beer/cocktail menu covers everything and more, and I got a 3 beer sampler flight for a solid 5$. Can't ask for much more with both price and selection. After much debate over their very large menu, I took the safe choice and ordered a Pub Burger. It was heavenly. Good size, very filling, and just overall delicious. What made my visit a 5 star though, was the service. Our server, David made us feel like we were the only ones in the building. He spent plenty of time with us to help with beverage and food choices, and he really knew the menu and made excellent recommendations. And for a busy lunch rush, even the cook times were spot on. I will definitely be back to visit, and am also looking forward to seeing what their new Scottsdale location will bring!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's always good, but today was exceptional. Management greeted me at the bar before I barely sat down and were friendly and prompt, Johncie came by almost immediately as well and didn't even ask what I would like to drink again showing that the managers immediately communicated with her. She was helpful, prompt, professional and friendly. I just had a simple lunch of sliders which were also prompt and tasty. I don't write a lot of reviews but being a bartender myself, I was beyond pleased with my experience. Bravo, Thirsty Lion."}
{"text":"Third trip here and the NW pub burger is the best.The staff has been great every time. Also a must try are the bacon cheddar potato pancakes. Nice atmosphere inside and out.:)"}
{"text":"This is an ideal place to go with a group of people. Plenty of beers on tap, extensive app menu and ample TV's. They also have trivia on Weds at 7. Not my first choice for a group dinner in the area but my favorite at Tempe Market Place"}
{"text":"Prompt service. Great food. Fish and chips delicious.  Also try the scotch eggs, so good! Granted I'm writing this after a passion fruit mojito and little sleep. But I recommend this place for a family visit or a date. Beautiful environment."}
{"text":"This place makes really great pizza's . One of my favorites is the Roasted Artichoke Spinach pizza. I also appreciate the lighting and the wait staff are friendly and attentive. They also have a wide variety of beers on tap.This is my go to place when I see a movie at Tempe Market place because it is close by."}
{"text":"I definitely had a great time here. Originally were going to head to get sushi at Tempte Marketplace and was happy to find that they finally put another fun bar in Tempe Marketplace because Cadillac Ranch and San Felipes gets a little old.   I went with one of my friends and we shared the soft prezetel for an appetizer and shared the Margherita pizza and Chipotle Mac & Cheese and had a few beers. I will definitely be back to try some more things on their menu.   You can definitely tell that some of the servers were new and weren't that expirenced but hopefully time will help that. Mike the restuarant Manager stopped by our table to see how our food was and how our expirence was which is always a nice thing for managers to do to get some feedback."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the service. Or lack of. We walked in at 1:00p on Saturday for lunch with a super-friendly male greeter. We were then turned over to the rudest female hostess we might have ever come across. Tall, younger girl. She couldn't be bothered more to have to seat us. We then waited for about 15 minutes for a server to come to our table, to no avail, before we ended up walking out. It was definitely busy, but there's no excuse for terrible service."}
{"text":"The food was great and the server took care of our big group. I would definitely come back again when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"If you like Chili's and TGIFridays but wish they were just a little more \"adult,\" you'll love  this place. They have all sorts of \"extreme appetizers\" and \"signature cocktails\" and so on.  There is a huge tap selection. However, a lot of them are occupied by BudMillerCoors or psuedo-craft brews like Newcastle, Blue Moon, and their ilk. They do have some very good beers, but the huge tap count is just not needed. The food delivers exactly what it promises. It's very rich and most things seem to be fresh. Prices are okay and their happy hour is pretty good. The service was good on my first visit and very bad on my second, so I don't know what to say about that.  I should admit that I just don't like going to Tempe Marketplace. If I have a friend who really likes this place and wants to meet up here, I won't say no. I'd just rather go to Taste of Tops, Papago Brewing, Four Peaks, or about a half a dozen other places."}
{"text":"Restaurant was not busy on a Monday night. At first a bit concerned when I walked in.  That said, the service was top notch and management made sure all was good.   Had the corned beef and cabbage off their St. Patrick's menu. A \"big boy\" portion and very tasty - loved the horseradish and mustard sauce."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Food was average and the service was sub par. I sat at the bar and they had two people working the bar. One would always ask what I needed but never followed through, I would have to wait for the second one to actually get a drink or order my food."}
{"text":"Decided to come in here after walking around at Tempe Marketplace the service was outstanding the food was great very attentive manager and waitress. What can I say 5 stars for sure"}
{"text":"Decided to splurge and try a bit of everything. Had the Bacon Wrapped Dates, which were phenomenal; as well as the Scotch Egg and Pretzel for appetizers. Then we had their Margarita, which was made with grapefruit. I must say that this was a welcomed change to an old friend I have grown fond of. I was so excited about their microbrewery that I decided to change up the pace and have a flight of all their dark beers. For $10 you can't beat it, and probably won't be able to finish them. To top it off we had their famous NW Burger which I think was perfect ending to a fabulous meal. The staff was attentive and very accommodating. This is my new favorite place when I fly into town. Move over Roaring Fork."}
{"text":"Did a work event here and it was taken care of so professionally. They set us up in the patio, banquet style. The food was delicious! Our waiter handled the large group very well and was very friendly the whole time. Will definitely do another event here."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I had a 3. Year old with them they did not bring a kids menu! Waiters 7 mins went to the front to tell them no o e had come to our table. After waiting for 10 mins someone came out we were on our way out the door. We had 3 year old with us who needed to eat and it is ridiculous to wait 1 mins before anyone came to our table. Not even water was brought to our table!! Will never go to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the area. I've been a local and have eaten at TL since it opened. There used to be a nice Italian place there and was one of our happy hour favorites. When it shut down, I was disappinted because usually the next restaurant is not as good. Well this didn't happen. Thirsty Lion is better! First - the staff is awesome. Bartenders get to know your name if you are a regular. Wait staff are very friendly. Prices are average Scottsdale 4 star joints- compares to Houstons, Roaring Fork, Don & Charlie's, PF Changs. Great atmosphere, lots of TV screens with sports, fine music. A word to people who knock any place for slow service. Keep in mind that any restaurant can have a crash of customers all at one time. Slow service once should never be a reason to write (or take seriously) two star ratings. Last - the food is excellent for what could be described as a classy, polished sports bar. My favorites - the short rib and steak dinners, fish tacos, spicy fried chicken sliders, burgers, all the salads. Only improvement could be in their happy hour. Just doesn't compare to the best in the area. But it's not bad and if you want things fast, that's the time to sit at the bar or a high top and enjoy great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. The potato cakes are fabulous.  Manager touched the table. Beer selection is great. Cynthia was our server and she went above and beyond!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  great atmosphere though.  great place to hang out. plays great music at a decent level.  (some may think its loud, if they are older)  Plasmas everywhere."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was just ok. it took about 15 minutes just to get our drink order and the waitress only checked on us once after we got our food. the Caribbean mojito was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time with a friend, excellent service, food came out fast, pizza was great, think our servers name was Robert"}
{"text":"Excellent on all counts. Service, quality and ambiance were all above and beyond. Because of the manager, bartender Randi and server Shannon we will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"The worst part is, before this evening I thought this place was fantastic. I've had dinner in several countries around the world and for the first time in my life I received my food before my drink. Unacceptable! I won't be going back to thirsty lion."}
{"text":"Happy Hour with friends on Tuesday Jan 31, just wanted to catch up with them and chat. Cross off doing that at this place!  Had to ask 3 times for them to turn down the music, I guess they assume we like to shout at each other..food and drink no big deal, ambiance gets a F for no regard for customers."}
{"text":"This is a strange review to write. Today I went to the Thirsty Lion for the first time and whereas I had a great experience, I am only giving 3 stars because of basically \"false advertising\". It is a great bar and restaurant but it definitely is not an English pubs as it is promoted. When the only really English item on the menu being \"fish and chips\" and yet it is packed with Mexican dishes, this was a let down.   If you want a great \"Scottsdale-like\" restaurant with friendly staff, this is a nice choice. If you want an English pub, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place a few weeks ago. We were going to be in the Tempe Marketplace area and need a place to eat dinner in the same area. And we ended up having a great time here and really enjoyed the food.  It's a large space and serves as a great sports bar. We ordered the spinach dip, chipotle mac and cheese and the bbq chicken pizza along with a few beers. We were able to just hang out and not feel rushed, which made for a nice evening. Everything really hit the spot and we ended up having tons of leftovers too.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and feel like hitting up a sports bar with higher quality food."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I did not expect to be writing this 1 star review tonight.  We have been going to the Tempe location for years so we were thrilled to have a location open in our neighborhood. We went in for happy hour this afternoon, around 5:00 pm and waited and waited...no acknowledgment from our server (we were told that Lexi would be right with us).  15 or so minutes without even being offered a nod or a glass of water is not ok. We spoke to the hostess, who'd already forgotten us, and she apologized.    We will give them another chance because the food is good but the service must improve. If you can't handle tables when you're not terribly busy, what will the dinner rush be like?"}
{"text":"I was definitely expecting something a little different. It really isn't reminiscent of \"pub\" at all and once I saw the menu with minimal pub fare on it, I just had to move past that idea and look at it from a different perspective. The hostess was rude, but our server was absolutely amazing. He joked, had a constant smile, and always could tell when our drinks needed refilled. 5 stars for him. I got a chicken caprese sandwich, sounds good right? It wasn't as good as I thought. The thick mozzarella on it was cold while the rest of the sandwich was hot which made the bread extremely soggy. I only ate a small portion of it. The fries on the side were great though, nice and crisp! I've heard their burgers are really enjoyable. I would go back and try something different, such as a burger, but from my first experience their we both agreed it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere-decor is interesting. Seats are comfortable even the high top table style. Menu offers many styles. Good drink options, too!"}
{"text":"Great food, but.... the service at the bar left a lot of room for desire. We've always loved Cornish Pasty, and every other location we go to, we've had good experiences. This place is very cool, but our server at the bar was very brash, little personality, and acted like we were interrupting her day. Otherwise I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Solid eats and a great beer selection.  One of the best options in Tempe"}
{"text":"The good: lots of draft beers to choose from, excellent fish & chips, delicious burgers... In fact everything I've tasted was pretty good. Not sure why this place serves anything sushi-like though when it's right next to a sushi restaurant.   The bad: I don't like the fancy sports pub atmosphere. The music is always entirely too loud. It's kind of tolerable if you sit outside but no one wants to be outside during the Arizona summer. I actually went back a few times with my husband and friends and I always find myself wishing they would turn the music down so it wasn't so hard to have a conversation with the people at my table.   Overall, the food, drinks and service are all good. But if you're looking for a quiet fine dining experience Thirsty Lion is not it."}
{"text":"Went here for the XTRA910 NFL Draft party on 4/25.  Place is nice setup. Lots of beers on tap.  Service or at least the server we had was horrible.  After 5 minutes of waiting for the server to come up, I placed my order for a coors light... waited 15 minutes, then the server came back saying my beer must of been delivered to the wrong table, asked what I wanted and then I waited another 15 minutes before getting my first beer.  Happy hour price of $3.50 for a pint of Coors Light is not the best, but ok.  We decided we wanted a round of shots and we were promptly told that they can't do that.  What a great drinking establishment.  No shots if you have beers.  Well who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes between a beer and a shot, not me.  Very disappointed with the service.  I really hope our server was having a horrible day because she was awful."}
{"text":"After a huge annual office event, I wanted a way to say, \"thank you\", to my hard working employees. I was put in contact with the event manager of The Thirsty Lion, Deanna.  Having never been to The Thirsty Lion, I wasn't sure what to expect. Deanna listened to what I was looking for, made suggestions on what food to serve for my particular group and what time would work best for our group. Best of all? She kept in contact with me each step of the way. Very professional! I've worked with quite a few event managers and this young lady impressed the heck out of me.  My office came in Tuesday, November 8th (amid all the election chaos!). The hostess wasted no time seating us. We had our own area towards the back of the restaurant reserved just for us. It was perfect! Sam, our server, was on top of her game! She made additional food suggestions (Artichoke Pizza and Nachos!), joked with my staff and brought much needed drinks out lickety split!   I have had my fair share of \"bar food\" and I guess that's what I was expecting. Boy, was I wrong! The food was amazing! The Edamame, pizza and even the nachos were far from the norm. They were delicious (and quickly devoured!). One of our girls could not have gluten and so Sam recommended the Brussel Sprouts (which our group agreed were amazing).    From start to finish, everything went flawlessly and our staff all agreed that The Thirsty Lion is now our \"go to\" for future events. I don't leave Yelp reviews often, but was so impressed at how our appreciation happy hour / dinner went, I felt compelled to share my experience.  Thank you, Deanna, Sam, and the entire staff at The Thirsty Lion for helping a bunch of working stiffs have a relaxing, fun (and delicious) evening!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table on my OpenTable app due to it being fairly new resturaunt to area... We got there early and we were sat right away even though people were waiting. Awesome open atmosphere!! Had the Scottish Eggs for Appetizer. They were awesome!! Fish and chips and pull-pork sandwich were delicious. The brownie dessert was good to. We want to go back and try the Sonoran enchiladas and there great happy hour.....Waitresses were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Food is great! The servers have always been great but the service at the front needs some improvement. There are so many hosts at the front it's overwhelming. The communication between them has been very poor and they either forgot about us completely, sat us and never sent a server over or walked around refilling water and saw we had not been seen so she turned around and walked off. We were looking forward to thirsty lion in Gilbert. I hope it improves!"}
{"text":"After having a horrible experience at another restaurant in Tempe Marketplace, I decided to drop into Thirsty Lion. The service here is definitely four stars. I would give it a five but I have had exceptional service at several restaurants. The food is the reason why they only get four stars. The crispy calamari was far from crispy and the crab and seafood cakes were awful! My Moscow mule was perfect so they get a pass it was happy hour and I will be back for other items I wanted to try!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Good atmosphere. My review is on the Fish and Chips. They are outstanding...Very very good."}
{"text":"Very nice patio, went for lunch on a Saturday, quiet and relaxing after a morning of shopping. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable (we had questions since it was our first visit). The NW Pub Burger was hands down one of the best burgers I have had in sometime. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Canada toMesa a couple times a year we live trying all the great restaurants. Our first night here we wanted to try something different so we went to the Thirsty Lion. We were looking for some lively music and good energy on a Friday night. We requested the patio and were put on the quiet side between to families with small kids. Not the vibe we were going for. Our drinks were good but pricy. $9.50 for a Moscow Mule I find this expensive as typically food is cheaper in the US. I ordered a Thai shrimp noodle salad. It's was 1/2 the size of most salads I order in the states. I was disappointed as it looked like a starter size. The shrimp tasted fishy, the salad tasted like a \"bagged salad\" and it was missing a couple ingredients listed in the menu. Overall not good for me. The restaurant was full so others might not have the same experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I both have birthdays in July and we came in with a birthday flyer for a free entree during the month of your birthday. We also brought two other friends and all ordered apps, beer, and an entree each. The apps were average, and the entrees were mediocre at best. But that was not the problem.  After asking for our check, we proceeded to wait 30 mins until going to the bar and asking for the check again (it was a Sunday evening). It FINALLY came and my friend received his free birthday entree. My entree however, was not taken off my check. I politely showed the manager my coupon and she proceeded to argue with me for 10 mins straight, saying that it was valid for only one person. I pointed out that the flyer did not say 'only one person', it said 'come in during your birthday month and receive a free entree'. She continued on her shaky argument until relentlessly and rudely giving me my free birthday entree.  Needless to say, Thirsty Lion has terrible service AND WILL RUIN YOUR BIRTHDAY DINNER. I cannot imagine the wait and the grief they will give you on one of their busy days."}
{"text":"Two friends and I decided to try this place out for St. Patrick's Day, since it's an American fare restaurant and bar they were not charging a cover charge to get in. We did not make reservations which if you decide to try this place out for any holiday or special occasion, I will strongly suggest that you do. We waited an hour to be seated, which wasn't bad for as many people as were there.    Once we were seated the service was great! I really wanted to eat something Irish and I was able to from their special St. Paddy's Day menu. I ordered the Irish Sheppard's Pie. It wasn't bad for an American restaurant and of course I had to get a drink which was the St. Paddy's Girl made with Jameson's Whiskey, Bailey's Irish Cream and  cold coffee and was rimmed with chocolate. This drink was delicious! A friend ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage which they served to her cold (not very cool) that got sent back and to make up for it the Manager let her order anything off the menu and gave her the dinner free without her even having to say anything. As soon as the dish was sent back the Manager was at our table to apologize. . The service and atmosphere of the place along with the live bands made the decision to go here a good one. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"For being a kind of expansive place the food was not good at all I know I'll never be coming back my expectations of this place were a bit too high and the service well it's eh you kinda have to look around and grab someone's attention or else they'll never come to you."}
{"text":"If you think this is a bar... DON'T! If you want to drink beers with friends, this is not the place! They cut us off after our 4th beer! In Tempe that is ridiculous! Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and was so pleased with my service. Shay is a great waitress to have if you can ask for her. She was fun and attentive. Also try the artichoke dip, she suggested it and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"We recently this past Saturday had our Holiday Party there at the Tempe location and it was a great experience.  Everyone enjoyed the party.  Food was great as well as the service.  Deanna the coordinator including the staff all worked really hard to make our event special and very attentive to all our needs.  Every bit was perfect, I would recommend them highly to anyone looking to host a work event."}
{"text":"Went to an Thirsty Lion with work colleagues and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was fantastic and I was shocked that they could make brussels sprouts taste so good!  We met Deanna that night and she was so pleasant and accommodating that we all felt right at home.  I highly recommend Thirsty Lion to all of my friends!!"}
{"text":"My bf had the pulled pork sandwich last night and it was DELICIOUS!! The pork wasn't too dry and it had just enough BBQ on it (it wasn't dripping with BBQ). I ordered the margherita pizza and that was pretty good. I felt like it had way too much cheese on it, but other than that, it was fine, but I'd probably order something else next time! I've also ordered a salad there before (forget which one) and it was HUGE! I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Thirsty Lion a few months back and had an awful experience! The food was cold, service was awful, and it took us 30 minutes to get the check.... On a Tuesday!   One night we were out and thought we would give it a second chance. Bad choice! We waited at the door for 15 minutes before someone came to seat us. Once we were seated, We had to ask the bartender twice to send our server to our table so we could order. Server came to our table about 20 minutes after we sat down (as we were gathering out belongings to leave) an took out whole order. The food came out undercooked and cold before we even got our beers. Again, we waited forever for our bill.  We will never EVER go back."}
{"text":"Great apps and cocktails  One if the best burgers in town too.  Been several times and never been disappointed  Patio is great"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are fantastic! I love all the cocktails and everything I've gotten from the menu is great. The service is sub par. I'd give the restaurant 5*'s if they had better service, but it hasn't improved since it opened. If you go, sit at the bar. The bartenders are FAR more attentive than the servers. Having to wait 10+ minutes to be greeted is excessive, and not to mention how long the food sits in the window.."}
{"text":"went for lunch and I made the mistake of ordered the shrimp tacos and a Smithwicks because I was craving them. The food came and my tacos were whack Besides all that, our server was crappy.  She never came around to ask if we wanted another round of brews... LAME. As a pub- they should be bringing barrels to us.  The bill was $50.00. the end."}
{"text":"I have gone to Thirsty Lion many times for happy hours and for dinner with my husband. They have a great selection for happy hour and everything I have tried there is delicious!! No complaints!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Watch all my soccer games there. Great food as well.  If you like beer and sport, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"We love trying new places, so we gave it a try. Won't go back. I gave it two stars because the spinach dip was good. After eating our entrees we were both not feeling well. We were both sick to our stomach for two days! The service was really slow as well, a bit stale, acted as if it was the last place they wanted to be."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but slow AF service. If you order to go, give it a solid 30 minutes on top of what they say. Not a good place to go to before a movie as you will likely be running late to the movie. Still good food and fun place to watch a game though.   I first posted this 20 minutes ago and am now editing it because I'm still waiting for food. Was told it would be ready in 20. Up to an hour now  Another update. Told them to call me once it's ready and went to a nearby place to get a drink. Was able to finish it by the time I got the call. Good news was, they weren't going to charge. They said it was due to an issue with the tickets so it was just recently put together in the kitchen. Also got a free appetizer card, yipee.   Got home, food was cold, so obviously not a ticket issue, oh well, still free"}
{"text":"Pretty waitresses, average food, slow service. There are better choices in this area of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Found this place with my friend. The pizza is great and lots of good beer on tap. We will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying \"have you guys decided yet on what you want?\", uhh yeah! Overall, service was poor and food was just okay. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We were a bit disappointed when we saw how small their beer selection was. The food was slow and it was quite pricey. Two of us, two beers and one sangria, plus two entrees with extra side of salad, we ended up with over $75. The side salad was charged for $6!!! The fries were not very seasoned. In general, the food was ok. Nothing specially outstanding that makes me want to order again. Michael was good. He was very attentive.  Conclusion: I don't think we would go back."}
{"text":"We've been to this place 2 times in the last couple weeks. First time with a group of 8 people. We had a great time loved the environment. We started with the scotch eggs - BBQ Bacon Wrapped Shrimp Everyone enjoyed them along with our meals. We had something from every part of the menu  Pork tenderloin - Baja Tacos - Bacon MAC - Gastro Pub Burger - Smoked Chicken Nachos...everything came out on time and was really good. Also shout out to Tim...Hey may have been a manager but was great with our party along with our servers! Will return when in the area"}
{"text":"We went to this place before a cub game because we were meeting people and riding the trolley. That is the best thing I can say about it, is that it is convenient to grab a beer before the game. The service was dreadful and the food was very average. We got there about 2:30 and it was not crowded. We sat at the bar and got a beer. Once our party arrived about 3:00, I asked if we could just grab one of the open tables. The host said it would be about 10 mins until a server arrived since they were at a change over time!!! Seriously?? It was after 3:30 before we got a server and another beer!! And the place was NOT busy!! Needless to say we will find another place to meet for a beer the next time we come to spring training!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service. Had a burger and a salad. Burger was excellent so was salad but the salad was a little on the small side. I would recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"So I've been here a handful of times. Never to have a full, sit-down meal, but to meet up with friends or co-workers for HH. Their drink specials are ok, but not amazing. Their beer selection is acceptable but not great. The bartenders and servers have been nice and attentive for the most part (although the last time, it took a while to get another drink). Also, the last time we went, the server messed up and put a couple drinks from my friends tab on mine, because we had SOMEWHAT similar last names, so she must of confused the two of us, but nonetheless she apologized and fixed the error.   We tried some of the finger foods. The pizza was kinda sad. Decent flavor but small and it was one of those pizzas where you take a bite and all of the toppings & cheese come with it, leaving you with nothing but tomato sauce covered crust. We also tried the fries which were pretty tasty and we loved the dipping sauce it came with. Ketchup is overrated, lol.  The decor is nice, almost has an 'up-scale' look to it. This used to be the home of Maria Maria (Carlos Santana's resturant chain), but it didn't seem to last very long. They have sports on a few of the flat screens scattered about and a mix of some 70's, 80's & 90's playing overhead.   I love Tempe Marketplace, so it works out that this place is in the same area, its just not my 'go-to' bar nor in my top 10. I will say the prices could/should come down a bit in order to keep the doors open and not become yet another tenant thats gone by the wayside.  If you're thirsty, it'll work."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now - once with a group of 10, once alone.  With the group, our server was attentive.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie seasonal special.  My entire table's order came out at the same time, except mine.  They told me mine would be right out.  10 minutes later, I asked the waitress about it.  She went to check on it and said it would be right out.  I got a piping hot meal, and for the inconvenience, she removed it from my bill.  I never would have asked for that, since I did get my food, but I appreciate the commitment to service.  It was delicious.  Not as good as mine, of course, but delicious.  Second time, I was killing time before a movie and was craving that same beer I'd had with my Shepherd's Pie, so I came back with my book.  I got myself a few beers and some appetizers.  I was all alone on the patio (it was a pretty warm day, but it felt good to me) but my server was consistent in checking on me without going overboard.  Food was very tasty (tempura green beans and pork sliders).  I definitely enjoy this place.  Good food, good service.  I'm far from a beer connoisseur, but they have a good enough variety for me.  There are really very few beers I do like, but they have at least two of them, so thumbs up."}
{"text":"Tons of tvs and a very spacious. The manager turned the sound on for the game as soon as we asked which was a plus. It also took over 30 minutes to get a cup of soup with nary an apology or reason. Decent pulled pork sliders as well. For a mall bar, it's certainly ok."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lions happy hour is a little ridiculous. There are other restaurants in San Tan that offer happy hour & give you the same size drinks & food for the happy hour price. Not Thirsty Lion, they give you smaller portions! They really need to rethink that if they plan to sustain their success because the newness will wear off."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in for a happy hour drink and bite to eat, while the wife does her shopping (and my shopping!). Love the beer list, plenty of local options. Food is always great!"}
{"text":"We visited one of our fav spots Friday got a spot @ the bar the best bar tender short blond hair very nice and help full I wish I got her name she is always ON Point never rude if we just want one drink or 30 lol Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting this place to be such a sports bar. I went for dinner and drinks with a friend the night before Halloween. All the servers were dressed up in costume. In fact I think almost everyone who worked at Tempe Marketplace was dressed up. Our server was great and the food was unexpectedly incredible. We shared the garlic artichoke app and my friend had a cheeseburger while I had the enchiladas. The artichoke was perfect and the enchiladas had a pretty big portion. I ended up taking half of it home. Yay lunch leftovers! Their beer list was pretty extensive too. The star knock off was because it was really loud with all the sports fans in there. It was hard to have a conversation at the table we had."}
{"text":"We come here for dinner and haven't been disappointed yet. It's good for big or small groups. My favorite meal is the Chicken Enchilada Stack."}
{"text":"The hostess was SO over the top attentive... Food ... BOOM and our server was nice as well. !! nice job Scottsdale sister store!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. There is a huge beer selection - 52 beers - and the food is great with large portions. Happy hour is my favorite time to go and I can get full from appetizers with no problem. The atmosphere and service is also outstanding, and I will definitely beer a returning customer."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The food wasn't cooked to order. My husband ordered a burger med rare, was delivered med well. Food wasn't hot. I ordered a pretzel with cheese, the cheese was good but the pretzel was awful! Seemed like a frozen pretzel barely warmed. I ditched the pretzel and stole my husbands fries to dip in the cheese instead. Will cross thirsty lion off my list and never go back. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Really disappointing ... sat for 10 minutes while a server worked tables on either side of us. And, a manager had to come by one table next to us to apologize for service. As we walked out, we let the hostess know why we were leaving ... she looked very surprised and said nothing. Go to Gordon Biersch ... service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I think this is the 4th or 5th home game for the Phoenix Rising FC this year and the Thirsty Lion is the 'host' for the pre-game. They still haven't figured out how to staff for this event. It's packed every time and there just isn't enough help. Today was the last time for me as I waited 15 minutes at the bar to just get server and nobody came. So I left with my guest.  Sorry guys. Good idea, bad execution."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at The Thirsty Lion tonight. The staff was friendly both at the door and while seated. The beverages and food were solid. I had a Moscow Mule and the Roasted Pork Cubano sandwich. The only reason I'm not leaving 5 stars is due to the fact that it took quite some time to receive the food after ordering. I'm thinking the staff is new as it just opened so I'm sure it'll speed up in the future. Overall, it was a great experience and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We really like this place! It's nice to have a fun place to go in Gilbert! A variety of food and drinks. Happy hour is always fun!"}
{"text":"5-Stars...   \"The Thirsty Lion will tame your appetite and your thirst\"    I have eaten at the Thirsty Lion since their grand opening at the Tempe Market Place. Their service and the atmosphere have always been off the scale with respect to their original menu and their staff. You can't go wrong at either lunch or slamming a few cold ones after work. Rock on...."}
{"text":"Felt like I was at Christie's Cabaret instead of a restaurant. Outrageously expensive beer, bartenders more concerned with showing off like they are pole dancing. I felt like I was supposed to bring a wad of $1 bills to throw at them. Completely classless place."}
{"text":"Love this place - a must stop every time I am in the greater PHX area on business. Sean and Elena in the bar are the best!!! Food is great, atmosphere even better after work and for games. Try the Scotch Eggs - a real treat."}
{"text":"Staff is pretty friendly, food and drinks are usually great. My boyfriend and I went for a late lunch and cocktails, it took us almost 25 minutes to get a drink because they were pretty much grilling us for our out of state IDs(this has NEVER happened to us here) They took our IDs for a second time for about 7 minutes and made us sign some sort of waver or something, then they sent out another waitress to literally question us about where we're from. We're originally from Washington state and still have those IDs. We totally played along with this game but it was very uncomfortable and embarrassing at one point, makes me never want to go back. Our sweet waitress who just moved from the Virgin Islands was the only thing that saved this experience.."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, this is 100% a bar that serves food. It is extremely loud, hard to have a conversation. Most of the tables are uncomfortable high-tops. The food was subpar too. Brussel sprout starter was soggy with an ok taste. The paella which the waitress said was really good was not good at all. I found a hard shell among my food that caused me to eat extremely carefully after the crunch on my jaw. The taste of the paella was bland and not a traditional paella. They need to call it seafood rice instead. I've had some lunch entrees that were better so I'll stick to lunch."}
{"text":"Busy on Saturday night. Our sever Amanda was very nice and patient with us as we decided on appetizers and entrees. Amanda suggested the Spicy Sausage Mac. It was so good. Everyone loved their food. Amanda was awesome. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The last two times I've eaten here the food has been really bad. Ordered a chicken dish and the chicken was tough and chewy... this time had the kung pao chicken and it had rice that must've been sitting in the cooker all day and then some. I won't be back! Thanks thirsty lion for crappy time..."}
{"text":"They need to get their crap together in order for me to come back. Service is terrible!"}
{"text":"Took a client there for lunch, good burgers and huge portions. Drinks did not run dry and the rest Of the service was good. Will definitely go back for another burger."}
{"text":"Great Service from BJ. Sean the manager was very accommodating to our group with special request. Great Food and Great Selection of Craft Beers!"}
{"text":"Very Good menu selection and craft beers. Awesome service! Hostess's welcomed us as soon as we walked in land we were sat immediately."}
{"text":"I was excited to have my friends show up to my local area for some food and drinks to celebrate my belated birthday and start of NFL season. My mistake to convince everyone to go there instead of the regular spots. The service was good and Erica was very attentive to refills and your regular is the food OK kinda thing. The problem began when our party of 15 started to trickle in and some members were demanding that the volume of the music should be turned down so we could here the SNF game. Big mistake if you ask for some accommodations at this place because it's Sean the managers decision when he's on watch. After discussing the reasons why he could not help with the game a bit of effort was shown when he suggested moving us to the other side of bar or finding us another location where we can enjoy the game. Bravo, as we all are enjoying our beverages and appetizers Erica our veteran well diversified waitress whom has traveled the world returns with a completely reversed attitude along with Sean. I'm thinking he guys got a table on the other side where you and your party can enjoy the game or would you like to sit outside with the big screen TV with your party of 15 that are all now arriving?  Nope big mistake to ask for accommodations here or leave Ericas area for another waitress area. We were accused of using offensive language in particular towards Erica and Sean demanded an apology from me the belated birthday boy...long story short we paid and left the place. Bottom line is Erica the worldwide waitress needs to grow up and not make accusations that weren't true especially to a well paying group of 15 whom were there to only celebrate.  Sean the manager needs to not only check his ego at the door before entering the establishment but take some management classes at the local community college and learn some etiquette on how to treat customers. I couldn't believe what was happening to me and my group...call it what you want...and it is what it is bs but the drama was unnecessary and unprofessional on both Erica & Sean behalf. Thanks for trying to ruin our Sunday night football game Sean...yeah its not cricket or Rugby or whatever sport you enjoy in your home town but I'm sure you have been in a pub or two and gotten a lot more belligerent than dropping a couple f-bombs while watching a game....or bloody hell!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a thirsty lion pub before and my first experience was absolutely wonderful! We had the spinach & artichoke pizza & spicy Mac and cheese which definitely has a kick) so good. Everything was great! The spinach dip was terrific which is served with flat bread (way better than chips) a total plus!! Very delish! And last but not not least, the blood orange Cosmo, A+ for me!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place a lot. Great atmosphere, and it is clean, clean, clean. The food is good and the service is okay at times. Great to come during lunch because its not so busy."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place. took forever for someone to take our order, I had to ask the server about were my Hubby's beer was had a Reuben and fries, both not edible and hubby's fish and chips were so greasy he couldn't finish his meal.. will not be going back..."}
{"text":"I first went to the Scottsdale location at the Scottsdale mall and really liked it. Found out they had the other location at San Tan Mall and was happy because that's much closer to us. Ate there twice now and have been very happy each time. Great service and so far everything we've ordered has been excellent! Nachos, pretzel, queso, BBQ chicken pizza, orange chicken, Rueben, for dessert we've had the brownie and Smores, both are really good. Kids love the place. Nice drink menu, love the passion fruit mojitos! This is our new go to place!"}
{"text":"We arrived in time for brunch on  Saturday. Great personable and attentive service from Tara T who payed attention to us and insured we had what we needed without hovering.  I'd give her six stars if a could.  Food was excellent, fresh, and the eggs were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Lots of big tv's everywhere to enjoy the games on. The wide variety of food is a bit overwhelming but a little something of everything and I was disappointed with nothing. Great good, great atmosphere. You must try it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews, but after my experience here, I knew they deserved some recognition!  I chose to eat here for my birthday dinner this year, for a variety of reasons: mutual location, variety of food and drink selections, and accommodating to larger parties.  I felt welcomed the moment I walked into the door and they were patient as my party of 12 slowly made it to the dinner table.  Our server was attentive and our meal went smoothly, we couldn't have had a better waitress.  They made me feel extra special on my birthday, including treating me with a birthday drink, and to top it off their staff all signed a card for me, they went above and beyond to make sure we all had a good time celebrating!  Hands down, we'll definitely be going back, but in a smaller group. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I will start by saying my experience trying to get a seat for happy hour on Friday and Saturday was amazingly difficult and frustrating.  My one star goes to the host girls that are checking guests in and one star for the manager who was not present.   I checked in on Friday at 4pm for happy hour with my 3 kids and was told it would be 15-20 minute wait. No problem.  There were empty seats outside and inside, I'm talking 12-15 tables. I walked around San tan village awaiting a text. 40 minutes go by and nothing. I ended up going to Brio that has a fabulous happy hour.  1:05 minutes later I got the text that my table was ready.  I came back Saturday at 3pm..took 45 minutes for the same 15-20 minutes that the hostess crew said it would take.  Very disorganized. The excuse both night was that they didn't want to overwhelm the servers or the kitchen.  I was dumbfounded by that answer.! You over hire and you pack that place in on your first week.  I did however finally get a table outside and was served by Ally.  She was great, attentive and the food and beer was good.  The managers need to get a handle on this disorganization up front and five realistic wait expectations and hire more crew. Boys a great concept in a great location. No wont come back until they straighten up and assure a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We met for lunch here after church. Party of 4..made an open table reservation on our way..Hostess was friendly and sat us immediately. Waitress was attentive but not familiar enough with the serving sizes of some appetizers. We had the crispy calamari..very tasty.  My father had the Stacked Enchiladas and loved them said they had a smoky flavor. Mom n I split baja fish tacos. Loved them. Great flavors. My husband had the Pork Cubano sandwich and liked it. Generous portions. Three of us got to go boxes..Sean the manager stopped by to check on service and food. We will be back. Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"The....... service........ is.......... so............ SLOW!  Great atmosphere and they offer a good menu but we have given this place so many chances in hopes the service would improve and it has not. Once seated, you are pretty much forgotten about for a while. Drinks from the bar must be sent in from the Tempe location because they take forever too.  Food service is no quicker and the past 2 times there has been mistakes with the order. Done. We have spoken to several other people who have had the same experience there. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Quick 3 night work trip to phoenix, recommended thirsty lion in tempe, what a treat, good food and recommend the grapefruit  basil martini, so good we went back for a second  nite of dinner. Shout out yo manager Howard and server Haley. Wish I was local"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it definitely won't be the last! This place has great customer service and a great menu. We had the Mac and cheese, tempura green beans, and the steak salad. Everything was super tasty. Steak salad was spot on! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The service here was surprisingly awful. The hostess was sweet asking whether we would like a table or sit at the bar. We decided a bar top would be better after seeing that almost every seat was taken besides the two seater at the end of the bar. The floor manager, I would assume, was rude and told us \"I am not a doorman\" and proceeded to make fun of us when we tried to show him our IDs as we came into the door. The bartender also denied our friends service because \"they already had a table.\" The waitress was obviously angry that we were not ordering food and gave us a scowl when we asked for drinks and not food. I will definitely not be coming back here due to lousy service. Maybe it was just a bad experience but I'm not spending my money here."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time in January.  Sat at the bar and ordered two Miller Lies on tap.  I was told by the female bartender that they only had it in bottle.  I questioned why they didn't have one of the worlds most popular beers on tap and the bartender rudely said, \"Because we have it in bottles.\"  I thought she was joking so when she returned with 2 bottles of Miller Lite I asked the same question and got the same rude answer.  I then noticed the price of the beers were almost 5 bucks each for a Saturday afternoon.  I then wrote an email complaining about the rude bartender and never received a reply.  I will never go back to this overpriced corporate dump.  I hope they fail like the last place."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. Long long wait after we placed our order. Wife's pizza was cold. My ribs were fossilized. Literally couldn't get the meat off of the bone. Bloody Mary was good. Waitress was attentive but seemed frustrated with the kitchen. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. The pretzel appetizer was great and the Ruben sliders made a great small meal. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"first visit and was a very pleasant one.  we had the spicy tuna roll appetizer, followed by the smoked turkey club, both were fresh and tasty.  im giving my thumbs up and will recommend this place to friends.  howard is the manager and justin was our server.  great experience and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Good food, lots of tv's and above all else I love that they have hooks under the pub tabs for purses. Genius!"}
{"text":"We visited this Thirsty Lion twice 1st was happy hour not bad on the drinks appetizers okay. 2nd visit tonight our food was slow in coming out I asked the manager what was taking so long he retrieved our meals apologized and said he take care of 1 round of drinks. I ordered the fall peppercorn burger Med done came out well and every other bite SALTY it was as if parts of it had the salt shaker poured on it. My husband ordered the club it came out just fine. Quality control a clear problem we will come back for cocktails but that's it ."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I recognized our manager from his previous place of employment. He was great there so they scored withy hiring him! I had the BBQ burger and it was so tasty! I'm not a huge BBQ sauce fan? But this was delicious!"}
{"text":"Goodness, how did we end up here? We were at this mall in Tempe attending a disappointing Road Runner Sports event and found ourselves starving and smelling something delicious in the air. We walked up and down the mall looking for someplace that could accommodate the newly vegan husband and somewhat picky kids. Sushi looked good but not for kids. California Pizza too many carbs. Mexican joint to busy and bar like. Cadillac Ranch no, been there before. Some Chinese place no beer, it is Friday night damn it. Smash Burger? Little one and vegan nixed that. Back to the Thirsty Lion - I think the thought of beer and no line settled it. Live and Learn. Live and Learn...  So we were seated right away, in the bar basically. Approached by our waitress, she was brusk but helpful. We order beer and soda (it's Friday people!) and the edamame appetizer. She brings the sodas. Another woman brings one beer. I mention we ordered two she looks surprised and says cheerfully \"It's on it's way!!\".  Um, no. I see our waitress passing by I mention we only received one beer. Okay. She goes and gets it. Edamame comes right away. YUM. It was spicy, garlicky, salty goodness. We should have stopped there but no, we pressed on.   I order the steak salad, she asks: how do you like your steak cooked? I respond: medium rare. The little voice in my head says \" You should ask what cut of meat it is\" Shush Voice, I'm getting meat! I say in my head back. My husband orders the closest thing he can find to vegan food: a veggie panini but asks No CHEESE. She says okay and writes it down, I watched. Little one orders off the kid's menu: mac and cheese. Big boy orders Fish and Chips.   We are happily eating our edamame and watching the Tempe Mall groupies doing their thing. I decide to visit the ladies room and this is a huge place so I set out in the most logical direction. I run into our waitress and ask, Where's the ladies room? She was so sweet she actually walked me most of the way there! Great service! I was impressed. The restroom is just around the corner of the pizza making guys. I thought I should have ordered pizza. Yummy looking.   I get back and the food is delivered. Where do I start? Steak Salad: meat was rare and tough. It should have been cooked more. The salad greens were fresh, red pepper good, onions too strong, dressing was nice and not too much. They put chimichurri sauce on the steak. It was over powered with thyme or marjoram. Too flowery and I've cooked with chimichurri and like it. But what was awful was the gristle. Made most of it inedible.   Little kid: his mac and cheese was fancy so of course he didn't like it. So I quickly ordered him french fries and then they were crazy salty so he didn't eat those either. Luckily (?) the waitress was generous with the soda. Big kid: very much enjoyed the fish and chips. I tried them - a bit fishy but the best thing on the table!  Now let's go vegan shall we? So immediately my husband takes a bite - into cheese. And stops eating. He looks through his sandwich plenty of provolone and mozzarella. A few minutes later the waitress comes by and asks if he is done, he says yes because there is cheese on the sandwich, she says sorry and walks away with the sandwich. We look at each other and say how is this going to turn out? So my husband sits there with no food while we eat. He eats a couple of french fries, we finish and she comes back with the check. For the full bill of 76.51 including the panini. Really???? Really.   She comes to collect and we ask about the sandwich and she demands: What do you want?? What do you want? My husband says I would have liked to have eaten with my family. She says: Would you like another sandwich? He says everyone is done eating. She says I'll bring you one to go! He says okay. A few minutes later she brings the sandwich and the same check. Alrighty we get your point. We pay the bill and give her a tip of 15% based on the three meals and drinks that were appropriately delivered.   Needless to say we will never return. Never.... ever .....ever."}
{"text":"Love the bacon wrapped dates and the salmon! Great tap selection, great seasonal menus!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Super Bowl Sunday. I had the Happy Hour caesar salad and the pear and prosciutto flat bread. Really delish, great server too! Will come again, its so convenient very close to home."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It has elements of the old pacific coast restaurant called Stanford's in Portland Oregon.  Big portions, a wide variety, great service and consistently good food make Thirsty Lion a must visit.   It brings me back to the great restaurants of the late 90s and early 00s,  these places were at the forefront of the dinning out age.  Great happy hour too."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for the Scottish eggs, queso dip with seasoned ground beef and the gastropub burger.  Thumbs down for the French Dip...which by definition should be made with prime rib but here is made with tasteless roast beef.  On second look, the menu does say roasted beef but we didn't read past French Dip and presumed that meant prime rib.  Our bad I guess, so we'll be back but won't order that sandwich."}
{"text":"For a place newly opened, the Lion was a great experience. Wait staff very friendly and manager acknowledged our arrival and expressed appreciation for our visit. Celebrating a birthday, the free sundae was a nice touch. Food was ample and delicious.  Wonderful beer selection. For a place near the parking lot, we'll return soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming in here. The drinks are good, the atmosphere is fun, and the bartenders are awesome!"}
{"text":"It is my go to place aways. I love this place. Alway has great food, drinks and service. Scott and Fern are my favorite bartenders. Awesome people."}
{"text":"We ordered queso dip and a sandwich to split which was decent but took a veeeery long time. The manager and server were nice and apologetic & we hate to complain however when we said we had somewhere to be there was no rush in taking our payment/cashing us out. Not somewhere I'd go again."}
{"text":"Prompt service and good food. The only drawback was we were seated near the bar area by the front doors. One of the front doors was in need of some WD 40 as it shrieked every time it was opened. You could even hear it over the conversations and sports events playing on the televisions."}
{"text":"Wasn't real impressed. The waiter was horrible. When the calamari came out it was over done. Way too chewy. The pretzel was good. Our food was all cold and the fries were burnt. All in all I don't think we as a family will be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were invited to enjoy a complimentary lunch at this new Thirsty Lion location in honor of their recent opening.  Hubby and I met up for a Friday lunch and it was a lovely time!  We sat in the bar area and our hostess made a point to let me know about the purse hooks under the table.  Good touch, though it would be even better if they were a little more off to the side.  We had a good view of a few TVs, but not in an overbearing way like in a sports bar.  We started with the California Roll, which greatly satisfied my pregnant lady sushi needs.  I'm not sure what the sauce on the side was, but it had good flavor.  I definitely appreciated that it wasn't a sad 5-piecer, it was actually a good size to split.  My entree was the BBQ White Cheddar Burger.  It was tall, delicious, and next to a pile of really good fries.  I enjoyed it with a cold, tall coke and it made for a great lunch.  For dessert we split the Cream Bruleé - it was also large enough to split, so I love that.    Our server got a little busy toward the end of our meal so we saw her less frequently as we tried to settle the bill, but the lunch crowd arrived all at once so it was understandable.  She was friendly and answered all our questions expertly.  Overall the food was great, service was nice, and I will return!"}
{"text":"Good spot, and a great selection of drinks for an evening on the town. The place can be a bit busy especially on the weekends, but I appreciate the service and promptness of the employees. The food items are great to accompany the wide drink menu! Definitely going to visit in the future!"}
{"text":"Went in on a lunch break and the sandwich I had was delicious. I believe it was the roasted turkey sandwich with chipotle aioli and avocado. Wow! So good. I love restaurants that spend time on design and layout. It felt very modern with a rustic feel. Open kitchen concept and the bar was smack in the middle. I'll definitely try it again!"}
{"text":"Great Irish sports bar that has great service and some really good bar food!  The chicken sliders and potato cakes are awesome!  Lots of TV's and a Jay Hawk basketball watch spot, makes this place one fantastic sports bar. Rock chalk Jay Hawk!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous glass of Pinot Grigio...,  the fried calamari was extremely salty...  margerita pizza was DELISH !!!!!   Service was superior."}
{"text":"Came out for a drink and appetizers and it was great. Our server Steve, always had good timing on drinks! Happy hour is every day which was a good surprise! Music was not too loud, liked the music videos on the TVs! Food was average. Service and drinks 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but I felt compelled to share my experience. After we were seated we had to wait for 10 minutes before our waitress came to help us. She took our food order but not drinks. We had to ask another waiter for drinks. I had iced tea that tasted like it had been sitting out for days. Half of our order was good but the other half was not worth the money. We had to send back a sandwich which was just terrible. I want to give this place another try but we haven't decided yet.  There are some other places near this restaurant that are better choices."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of restaurants at a mall but they did a great job with this place.  The decor and lay out is great, it feels open but at the same time you don't realize if it's half empty or packed.  I had the burger with mushrooms, swiss and the side salad.  Not great but pretty decent. Nice serving.   The kids mac n'cheese was pretty good.  Not pricey.  For sure a place to try."}
{"text":"From our waiter to the manager, they were great people.   We have a child with food allergies and it is hard to find a place that takes our concerns as their own. The kitchen has an awesome kitchen manager. he helped us with finding out ingredients of a specific item. He took the time to actually go look and come back.   This location has some valueable employees and would be stupid to mess that up.   Staff we apprecaite all ur work and look forward coming back."}
{"text":"Decent food, mediocre service, horrible excuse for dessert menu. I may sound like a snob, but I deserve to have an opinion after 11 years in the restaurant business as a certified chef and current restaurant manager. Some tidbits for your wait staff: 1. Do not serve me a dirty glass that still has residue on it from the previous beverage that was in it. Gross! And when you bring me a second glass, make sure it doesn't have residue on it! Is your dishwasher broken? 2. When a customer orders drinks, especially alcoholic ones, you keep them coming! If my glass is empty and I sit there at my table for more than 15 minutes before you acknowledge that I may want another round, (hint! Bigger bill, bigger tip) you're losing out on your gratuity. 3. When the MIC/MOD comes and asks us for another round before you bother to even check on us, you're losing your gratuity. 4. To the Executive Chef, if you even have one at this establishment, shame on you. Do NOT put something on your menu that you can't live up to. I ordered Creme Brûlée, and yah I should have thought twice about ordering such a sophisticated dessert from a \"pub\" but thought, hey, it's my favorite dessert and it's only 4 ingredients...how can you f**k that up? Well, congratulations, you did. That was the sorriest excuse for Creme Brûlée I've ever had in my life. The \"custard\" if you will, was overwhelmingly sugary...like so sweet I couldn't even taste vanilla bean (and yes I know the entire top layer is sugar, that's the point of Creme Brûlée- the burnt sugar on top- but no, that is not what I'm referring to. Not to mention, the consistency of it was so watery it could have been advertised as a Creme Brûlée shake. Call me what you will, but I stand my ground. Do not, I repeat, do not advertise greatness if you can't make it right. 5. Lastly, it took over 15 minutes to give us that pathetic excuse for Creme Brûlée, which was not delivered by our server. Nor did he come to check on us to (2 min table check) to see if everything tasted ok...at which point we asked for the check. You're lucky my husband paid for dinner because I would have left you nothing."}
{"text":"Food and service were outstanding. The prawns with bacon were excellent. I really enjoyed the pork tenderloin winter special. My server also recommended the Papago orange blossom wheat. Great recommendation since it went well with everything. Another new find for AZ."}
{"text":"I can't say enough amazing things about Thirsty Lion, it was my first restaurant I had eaten in Arizona and I keep coming back.  It is the only restaurant I frequent at Tempe Marketplace.  Great environment comfortable setting, and delicious food... What could be better? The managers are extremely friendly and so is the servers. I have been there over 30 times and never had a bad experience with a waitress which is extremely important to me.  Steaks, burgers, and enchilada stack are just a few of my favorites.  Highly recommend Thirsty Lion if you have the opportunity!"}
{"text":"The moment we walk in, we were greeted by 4 different people. How polite! We were seated right away, and told the happy hour/drink specials. (My kinda service). We put in drinks and the waitress gives us suggestions on food. They have a cool happy hour where if it's over 105 degrees, margaritas are $4. What a deal! My friend ordered a pear cider and didn't like it, the waitress took it back and brought her a different drink, and she did it with a smile. So polite and sincere. We had the California rolls, pretzels, hummus, sliders and calamari. I wouldn't recommend the calamari but everything else was phenomenal. So yummy! Definitely going to be one of my go tos when I'm in the Gilbert area!!"}
{"text":"Zero stars isn't an option. Friday night 10pm they are fairly busy but 20-30% of their tables are empty and my wife and I stand at their front door for 5 minutes being passed by multiple employees with nobody saying hello.  Finally get seated in the worst possible seat out of the 30 that are open. Sit there for 10-12 minutes again while multiple employees pass by nobody even acknowledging our existence.  Finally say screw it and get up to leave and the guy who sat us says \"have a nice night\". Yeah right DB i wont be back. I bet they wont be open long with out a major restructuring.  We went to blue 32 right up the street. They were very happy to see us and help us as always."}
{"text":"The first time I went, it was pretty good. Every subsequent time we have gone, it has been worse and worse. We stopped in today for happy hour, and the food was awful. The happy hour price for spinach artichoke dip was 6 dollars, and it was tinier than a tin of cat food. Considering that this couldn't fill up an infant, we also ordered the pretzel and California roll. The pretzel was overcooked and very hard, and the accompanying cheese sauce was grainy, and tasted very poor. The California roll was old, and cold because it had been sitting in a refrigerator all day. It fell apart as soon as you touched it and was cold and slimy. We won't be going back unless we are only going to stop by for a single beer after a movie."}
{"text":"Good food and a great waitress. Highly recommend Ask for Crystal.  We have been here a few rimes and Its worth the visit.."}
{"text":"I wish your food wasn't so delicious, because I've abused myself 1 too many times now coming back to this location. The food is always great and the service always stinks. I've been here about 10 times in the past 7 months. Every time we order an appetizer it comes out 2 minutes before to 20 minutes after our entrees. Teach the servers how to hold food? Every female server we've gotten can't be bothered to come back to our table for anything except our food and drink orders and the check. The male servers seem to be better with follow up during the meal, I'm not sure why. I seem to get better service from your bartenders and bussers."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Our server Anthony was great and was on top of everything. Ordered the Baja fish tacos, which were good, but was a bit surprised it wasn't beer battered but was grilled instead because when I order fish tacos in other places they usually are. Might have been my mistake & didn't read the details on the menu and I may have set my self up on that one! Nonetheless, they were pretty good and satisfied the craving."}
{"text":"Went here about 2 weeks ago for the first time and it was absolutely wonderful! The food was delicious and there was a wide variety of beer and cocktails. I had the blueberry bliss- so tasty! We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, a flatbread, and a sandwich, all of which were very good. The staff was pleasant as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ate here on the 2nd night of the location being opening. We had Vinnie, whom mentioned he was from the Tempe location, he was GREAT! We exchanged quite a few laughs as he understood our various concerns due to food intolerances. The kitchen was running really slow and they even ran out of the entree we both wanted. Vinnie was on top of his service as well as provided options we would like due to sold out items. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and it's been great each time! I'm always surprised how empty the restaurant is because they have great deals and happy hour on the weekends. The patio is awesome when it's a nice day also. I highly recommend the brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"I love the seasonal dishes they have here! The bartender at this location is super attentive and makes great mixed drinks as well. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I try my best to avoid chains, but was drawn to Thirsty Lion on a Saturday shopping excursion with the promise of happy hour deals.   The restaurant did not disappoint. A sweet, peppy server kept me happy with tea refills while we ate fried calamari, a California roll, and garlic edamame.  While none of those food items are particularly thrilling on their own, they were well executed, delivered to our table in a timely manner, and we got out of the restaurant full with having spent less than $25. The breading on the calamari was especially yummy and not too heavy, complementing the calamari well.  Happy hour prices are very reasonable -- many items for around $5 -- while their regular menu varies greatly in cost. Digs are what can be expected from a chain restaurant in a mall -- clean, but a little boring."}
{"text":"The food here was great! The staff was nice, but the music playing was super raunchy and loud."}
{"text":"Visited for our first time this evening with my 3 kids. Sat outside on the patio, love the patio area. Very nice Ambiance and stayed cool with their light fans. Got sat by some obnoxious drunks who should have been cut off.  Moving on... My kids ordered Mac n Cheese from the kids menu. Not a creamy sauce, more thick melted cheese, I liked it... My kids did not. No drink included in the kids pricing. They do reverse happy hour 930pm to 12 seven days a week.  My son got the pizza and pork sliders.. Both pretty good. I got the California Rolls(tasted ok)  and the chicken tenders (very small, meat was tough, batter was super peppery, not impressed) Water doesn't taste filtered.  Only think I loved besides the Ambiance was the Orange Blossom Beer. Service was ok,but not great. Probably won't be back for food, Maybe drinks.  Too many good restaurants in Gilbert. Sorry Thirtsty Lion! Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to grab a good beer and food and stumble upon this place. Great day for patio sitting. Staff was fast and attentive and the food was well worth it. We shared a flight of beer. My favorite was a cherry cider which was new to me. They also had a white chocolate wheat which was interesting to try. Overall it was a nice place but I found something next to my fries that I had to take two stars away."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was with a group of people at your restaurant.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken. It was OK.  I would give it a 6 on a 1-10 scale.  My wife makes much better Kung Pao Chicken. Your sauce was too strong, the vegetable mix wasn't very good. and the chicken could have been better. You should do better.  It was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This was a very awesome place to hang out for dinner and drinks. The server was very nice and knowledgeable. Even though he flirted with my boyfriend, he was still ok haha The drinks had a strong punch and best of all were their French fries!! WoW those fries got me hooked! Haha strongly recommend this place..."}
{"text":"I've gone to the Tempe location numerous times and loved it. I was excited to try this new location because it's close to my house. My sister and her fiancé were in town and I took them saying how great it is. I was really annoyed they were out of multiple food items. Then our drinks took forever and my soda was flat. I have more than 1 star because our waiter was good. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of friends on a Saturday night and were seated immediately, which was awesome since I expected a bit of a wait. To start we had the artichoke dip and brussels sprouts that were amazing! The brussels sprouts were so soft and tender and were lightly seasoned. The spinach artichoke dip was so flavorful and even had a nice spicy kick to it. My friend and I decided to split the fish taco entree, since at this point we were about full. The waitress told us if we split it we get an extra taco, which was awesome! The tacos were quite flavorful and I enjoyed the tomatoes, lettuce, and lime that came with it. I ordered the asparagus as my side, since the beans that usually come with it contain bacon (which I don't eat). The asparagus was good too, but at this point I couldn't take another bite of something.   Overall the food was fantastic and we had an awesome waitress who was super helpful & friendly! I definitely intend on returning to sample their fish and chips, since I heard that's one of their best dishes."}
{"text":"I went there on Thursday afternoon around 3pm for the first time with my husband. We hadn't had lunch, so we decided to take advantage of the Happy Hour based on my friend's recommendation of the place.   We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. The service was good (even though hardly anyone was there at that time of day), the atmosphere was very nice (Tavern with Old English feel), and they offered a very wide variety of items and drink specials for Happy Hour.  We had the garlic edamame, crab cakes, chicken fingers, spinach dip, and calamari (we probably would have been full with 4 items, but we over-ordered due to skipping lunch).  I'm looking forward to going there again for another Happy Hour and want to go back again for a regular dinner as well. The menu looked great."}
{"text":"Yuck.  From the service to the food, this place was horrible.  Ordered the chicken enchiladas and couldn't eat more than a few bites.  They were terrible.  Took forever for our server to acknowledge us and even longer for her to bring the food.  The prices were crazy expensive for nearly inedible food.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We've ate and drank here 4 times. I will say it's consistent! I like it.  Delicious food: pork sliders, burger sliders, pizza Okay (not great) food: pretzel bread  Drinks! The lion lemonade is delicious! They have a few other \"girly\" drinks on their happy hour menu that are good. Pretty much every drink we try is good.  Pros: -Sliders -Pizza -Mixed drinks -happy hour and REVERSE happy hour - good deals! -Clean and updated  Cons: -During the week they close at 11p or 12a, they don't have bar hours"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and LOVE the food. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the last time I was here was for a lunch date (first date) on a Saturday at noon, they open at 11:30. The hostess seated me at a table that had salad on the floor and the table or chairs weren't wiped off very well, if at all.   The hostess apparantly didn't see the serving of salad she was standing in or just didn't care, but everyone ignore the lettuce, croutons and tomatos on the floor.  Everyone probably figured that since it was so early that all the salad would be kicked under the table before the dinner rush :) Our server was excellent, I wished I could remember his name, but he was very attentive and a very cool guy. For lunch I got the lightly breaded chicken in lemon caper sauce with pasta and fresh green beans.  It was excellent, I must admit.  It's one of those dishes that's sooo good that you'll eat until you're full up to your eyeballs.  Of course I'll go back, next time I'll know to kick the krap on the floor out of the way, too."}
{"text":"The food as always was delicious!  Our fave is the Artichoke and Spinach dip.  Tonight the low stars are due to the service.  Never once did Bree the bartender refill my water glass or even ask us if we needed anything after the food came out.  Usually get good service, but tonight she seemed to not care."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion is a pretty solid restaurant to dine at if you're in Tempe. They have a strong selection of local beers, especially if you're a fan of IPAs. The servers are very friendly and provide fairly fast service.  If you come in, make sure to order the Traditional Scotch Eggs. It is by far the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting great after reading the reviews but my husband and I had a fantastic happy hour here with great service.  We had a beer flight, and stated with the edamame, awesome but messy.  Then we shared the chicken fingers, pork sliders and fries, all delicious.  Our server Brittney was friendly, attentive and helpful.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is a newer restaurant downtown Gilbert. It is a big place so usually easy to get a table or seat at the bar. Lots of drinks on the menu and good food."}
{"text":"Took a group, fantastic service and really great food, not overpriced, not too loud, very clean and again fantastic service."}
{"text":"Good food, service and beer selection. But PLEASE turn the music down!! It's too loud and \"head banger\" selection doesn't make it in GILBERT AZ. on Tuesday!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy choices of Happy Hour food and drinks! Waitress' attentive even though it was getting busy. Definitely will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion used to be our go to spot for lunch or dinner anytime. But today was really a miss for us.   The ceviche is a very tiny portion, served in a shot glass filled with half lettuce. Lettuce should not be a food item in ceviche anyway!   Margarita pizza had no mozzarella on it and maybe had one sprig of basil on it, with cherry tomatoes....WHaattt!!!!     Waiter was nice and very pleasant, but the hostesses were all very sloppy and looked very disheveled.  One hostess had hair extensions that were peeking out of her scalp and her hair was all matted and tangled in the back. I think she was the same one who had on a skirt and she had tattooed letters all down her legs, it looked as if a four year old drew all over her before she went to work, Maybe that's actually what it was, Nothing wrong with tattoos or hair extensions, but pull yourself together for gosh sakes!  Look presentable, you are the first impression to customers.   We complained about the ceviche, and never did a manager come over to apologize and we saw the waiter explaining to him from across the room that it wasn't good.   This place seems to be going south fast.   We would normally eat here three to four times a month, but unless they get it together, we are not interested in returning."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. I've waiting to write a review based upon previous reviews and was expecting to have a similar experience eventually. Mostly I have not had a bad experience yet. I tend to only go during lunch hours though.   The bad ; its expensive from the food to the drinks, they also don't have the MLB package which is something I expect for weekday afternoon drinking in the summertime, and the wait staff seem a bit snotty.   The good: food has been excellent every time, mixed drinks are delicious and the bartenders give excellent recommendations and unlike the wait staff the bartender staff has been fun and friendly nearly every time I've gone.   My recommendation is go for lunch, sit at the bar, order some food to share and have a 1 cocktail. After that switch to beer or water unless you want a large bill."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a bite to eat and a beer (or six) after work with my buddies. The staff is very knowledgeable, and are really fun as well.   They have a cool environment, nice selection of beer (although personally I think they could expand a bit). Sam, the bartender, is super chill and fun to talk to.   Will definitely be coming back many more times.  PS get the pulled pork sliders."}
{"text":"Mom and I split one of those summer specials and had some fried green beans. Good food. Had one of the draft beers as well. Really good stuff too. Service started out lame but it picked up as the night went on."}
{"text":"THIRSTY LION-- I love to write good reviews, unfortunately sometimes I have to write a less than favorable one. Sadly this review is long overdue. Was hoping they would improve so I wouldn't have to write a bad one. --First, I will say, we frequent this place only because it's the only restaurant close to the theater. We are always hoping for good food and service, but are always underwhelmed. This time was no exception. Cobb salad was literally the size of a side salad (on their side salad sized plate), but the price of a large cobb salad that you could get anywhere else. Waiter said that the greens were a romain blend. Came out with very little greens and no romain. Don't even know how they can call it a salad. Very few greens, not like a typical salad. And the cheap, fluffy, mixed greens...but with no \"fluff\", not fresh. Had some teeny, tiny pieces of hard chicken and some blue cheese crumbles, etc. Everything was very finely chopped like they were trying to hide the fact that it was not fresh, nor good quality. Dressing wasn't good, very heavy blue cheese vinaigrette that did not taste fresh. So, not loving that, we thought we would order some nachos. Surely you can't get nachos wrong. Nachos arrived and looked so good, but were not. Again, gross, hard, tiny pieces of chicken and some weird sour cream blend that we couldn't figure out. We asked for a couple sides of salsa thinking that might make it better. Salsa arrived and looked awesome, so we poured it all over the nachos, only to find that it was bad. Not just bad, but fermented, sparkling, fizzy, old, gross. We told the waiter and he had the chefs try it. They agreed it was fermented and threw it all out. I understand this can happen sometimes, but it seems to go hand in hand with the quality of food that we have become used to here. We've tried one of everything it seems. Nothing great. California Roll is prob the best thing on menu, but takes FOREVER (maybe only one chef knows how to prepare?) and has just a speckle of avo so they can say they put it in. Really want to like this place. Given it so many tries. Our waiter, although not super knowledgable of the menu, took good care of us. I would give him a shout out, but don't want to associate him with this poor review. Sorry Thirsty Lion. Please let us know when you make some healthy changes. We would love to see your restaurant improve. I will give two stars instead of one, because of wait staff...not always the quickest or sharpest...but always kind and sincere."}
{"text":"Overall average experience.  Decent drinks from the bar, and the food is a step up from the food court option down the hall inside the mall.  When we arrived, the hostess acted as if we had imposed on her otherwise world-peace enabling duties.  She tried to force us into a booth in the back of the relatively empty dining room, and she audibly scoffed when we asked for a standard table with chairs to better enable our mobility with our infant. There were plenty available, afterall.  Once seated it took some time for our server to come over.  Prior to her arrival at our table she had to go through the process of loudly arguing with a couple of her other serving colleagues about their apparent failings at life, so her attitude while gracing us with her presence was less than chipper.  She took our orders, brought our food, and processed our check.  So she did her job, but no extra \"pieces of flair\" to warrant a particularly good tip.    Overall the kitchen and bar were slow, and the service was pretty terrible.  Won't be planning to return and wouldn't recommend unless you really just want to catch a game and could care less about service.  There is better quality food nearby."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork Sliders = LOVE.   Stopped by after shopping because we were starving and Thirsty Lion was one of the places open late. There weren't many customers and it was probably because it was late on a Wednesday night. The ambiance was lovely and intimate. My friend and I ordered pulled pork sliders and the Classic Reuben sandwich halved with fries. The pulled pork sliders were so filling even though we split it between the two of us. I don't know what magic they cook it with but the coleslaw and the pulled pork went together like peanut butter and apple slices. The hand-cut fries were delicious because you could taste the freshness inside. Moreover, the sandwich was loaded with meat and was more than enough to make us want to come back again. Our server was really sweet also."}
{"text":"Good food and cool atmosphere.  Nachos are great.  Fish and chips delicious...really good light IPA batter. Wife's burger good.  And the kid's pizza passed the ultimate test.  Nice addition to San Tan...will be back."}
{"text":"Food was great! Atmosphere was really cool and inviting. The two hostesses even opened the doors for us as we walked in! Service was top notch and everyone was very friendly and attentive. Manager of the restaurant was taking his time to make sure to do table touches without being too interruptive which was really nice. Only reason that I'm giving a four star review is we thought some of the female waitresses could have worn something that better fit the atmosphere. Seemed like some of them could hardly walk comfortably without worrying about a wardrobe malfunction, for the price range it should be a little more family oriented, less Las Vegas oriented. That's my only complaint, everything else was top notch! Great food, Great service, all the food we saw being brought past us going out to other tables looked fantastic! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My family and friends all love this place and usually come here once a week. We've yet to have something we don't like. They've got happy hour 7 days a week with really good specials.  Some of my top foods to get are the kale salad, steak salad, orange chicken, kids Mac n cheese, caldera sandwich, happy hour pizza, and the scotch egg. You really can't go wrong with anything. They're grapefruit basil martini is also top notch. I usually only drink dirty martinis but there's is refreshing and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Have visited the Lion a couple of times now, to have a bite after a movie. I like the place. Service is good, great selection of beer and drinks, and yummy food. What more can you ask for? The first couple times I ordered a burger ~ they're 1/2 pound burgers! Holy cow!  On my last visit, I ordered the Chicken Penne ~ Gorgonzola Cream dish. SO good; I couldn't stop eating it. Some garlic bread would have been a nice addition. Great place."}
{"text":"Thirsty lion pub is has the best happy hour late night!!! Fried chicken sliders, out of the world potato cakes and this sriracha dipping sauce for the fries is amazing. Let alone the amazing service I got from Brianna. Always making me comfortable and welcoming in anything I needed, as I am usually picky about my meals. Thank you staff and join them daily at the Tempe Marketplace"}
{"text":"Not ready for prime time. Slow service, food was cold, do yourself a favor and wait six months and try it again.  They recently opened this restaurant and you can tell.  Tempe location is way better."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, hands down the best top shelf margaritas in Scottsdale. Unfortunately the food was awful. We were a party of 6 and 4 meals were a disappointment...chicken caprese sandwich char burned on one side, salmon risotto that was served instead on cold white rice...chicken enchilada stack was simply inedible... waitress didn't ask what was wrong as she cleared the same full plate delivered 30 min earlier, obviously untouched. Not a surprise the place was nearly empty"}
{"text":"Eh, nothing to rave about. Went for happy hour at 9:30. Appetizers were cheap and pretty good but not amazing.   Drink prices suck. $4 domestics on happy hour. $6+ for everything else.   Service was bad. Got 2 rounds of drinks and each took about 10 minutes. I knew it was the server's fault (as opposed to the bartender) because both times the beer had no head and was a few centimeters short from being full....definitely sat on the bar for a while before being picked up.   Don't plan on going back. Can find cheaper happy hour prices with equal or better food."}
{"text":"Wow.....this place has so much potential....but it falls flat on customer service.  We waited forever for our drinks....on a Sunday afternoon when the place was only half full.  Our waitress was disinterested and preoccupied with other duties in the kitchen or at the bar drying glasses.  The prices for drinks are high as well....especially given that you might die of thirst waiting to get one.  I'd pass on going to this pub......to many other good choices around town"}
{"text":"Middle of the road food.  I think it is overpriced for what you get here. The server was very nice and did her best to make a good experience.  As Jim Carrey would say, \"I've had better.\"  Cool atmosphere, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch at about 12. We didn't get greeted for about 15 minutes. It was busy so it was a little understandable. The woman who greeted us was not very friendly but I let it slide because I knew she was probably weeded. It took over 30 minutes for our food to get to the table, which is ridiculous for lunch. And when I brought it to the attention of the manager, he was rude as well. I've given this place a few chances because the food is always good but the service is terrible every time."}
{"text":"We've been let down so many times by Thirsty Lion but thought we'd give another try tonight. Should have known better seeing as we have compiled 6 free appetizer coupons. Tonight we waited 5 mins to be seated as a hostess clocked herself out and no one came to greet us. We were then seated. After close to 10 mins what appeared to be a manager took our drink order and were told our server would be right over. After an additional 5 mins a server came over and said \"I noticed you've just been staring at your menus has anyone helped you?\" After a total of 15 mins and NEVER even reveling a glass of water we left and went to a restaurant near by. We will never be back we've given far too many chances"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on a visit to the Scottsdale fashion mall, and was I glad I did! It wasn't on my radar at all, and I was reluctant to ask about gluten free options/offerings, but was delighted to find that not only did they have some, they had a dedicated menu for them! After being quickly seated I perused the menu and decided on the humus and veggie plate as an appetizer and the shrimp tacos as my entree. My eyes were bigger than my stomach though, as the appetizer was enough for a meal, but once the tacos and fixins came out... well I had to dig in! The food and service were great, and didn't break the bank either. I left stuffed and happy. Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will definitely stop in... you should too!"}
{"text":"Great food, pub feel, great service, good selection of beers, and all around awesomeness!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this place. The atmosphere is pretty cool. Tonight was perfect for outside dining and fire pit. And that's were my compliments end. The food is mediocre at best. I got a salad as an entrée and it was pitiful. It was supposed to have strawberries and chicken and it had very little of either. I thought maybe I got a starter salad and not the entrée but the waitress acknowledged that's how they did them there. She even said that the salads at the Thirsty Lion weren't as big as Zipps. The service was also slow.  I'd think twice before going here again."}
{"text":"Positively surprised. Way bigger than expected, but also way cozier. Inspiration from the original pubs, but on a grand American scale. Pretty cool.   The bartenders are professional, with a little urge to showoff. That's cool with me.. I'd do the same if I was a bartender. The beer list is nice, very nice. Imported Pilsner Urquell, which is chzech pale lager (and has claims for the first pilsner in the world). But I opened with a Vanilla Porter that was great.   I dont know what I expected out of this place, but I expected less than I got. Nice.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Made reservations and they had our table ready.  Almost everything on the menu can be altered based on allergies or other eating restrictions which is why we selected this place for our party.  Waitress had no issues with this.  Food came out quickly and was consistent.  Above average bar food.  We came when it wasn't that busy, I can see how it would be very loud though if the place was packed."}
{"text":"I've been to the Thirsty Lion in Portland, OR and had the opportunity to come to the one in Gilbert. I had the Sesame seared ahi Tuna... and although Tuna doesn't come to mind when you're at an American restaurant.. it was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend had the spicy fried chicken sandwich and he really liked it! The staff was friendly and it's a great atmosphere. Defiantly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Party of 11. Two crazy kids under 5 and one sweet lil baby(4 months)  Not the most exciting table for a server.  Most of the time , an annoying table.  But our server (wish I got his name but dark hair , very sweet and easy on the eyes) showed nothing but respect and awesomeness the whole time.   We came from out of state and had an amazing lunch here.   Thank you thirsty lion.  You are doing thing right.  Food was perfect. (shrimp tacos for me)  Service was amazing (including everyone that ran food and brought us our drinks)  All around an amazing time."}
{"text":"The place was awesome. Had a great lunch. Krystle was great, Erin provided good prompt service. The food suggestions were very good and we enjoyed our meal. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome Scottish Egg!  You have to order it when you go.  I got the beet salad which wad wonderful!  Tip: get the dressing on the side.   I loved the 80's - 90's music videos they were playing. The crowd was happy so it was a very positive vibe.  Out side of that..you get lots of great food for a good price. I will be back."}
{"text":"Just the beginning of a disappointing evening.  We went to have dinner before a show.  The aps were cold and for the most part tasteless. The bar staff was unattentive and when we asked for something it was almost like we were bothering them.  Definitely not going back.  We didn't say anything about the aps because we were so hungry it wasn't funny and by the time we would have gotten anyone's attention it would have been to late."}
{"text":"I order a simple plain burger with  no salt and they come back with a burger full of cheese and other stuff and the wrong fries.  It's not that difficult, problem is the bartender wasn't listening.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is beautiful from fall to spring on this patio, their happy hour apps are yummy. Dig in! :)"}
{"text":"Good margaritas, and beers.. Happy hour isn't super impressive. Pricey, but still was an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Horrible food. I went here last night with a couple of friends. The food was below average. The calamari is clearly frozen and comes in a bag. They only have the rounds for that reason I'm sure. The pub fries were pathetic I only received the ends and they were burnt and oily. I will not be back. Save your money."}
{"text":"Yo yo Az check out Thirsty Lion at fashion square . The flatbreads and salads are a must trygrab your bestie and go hungry I do recommend sharing because portions are big.  Don't take my word for it , try it out yourself and let me know what you think ! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious!  The brussel sprout, quinoa and chicken salad had perfect amounts of everything so that every bite had a little bit of each.  Also had the caprese chicken sandwhich, which was excellent."}
{"text":"Took my wife to the lion for their \"Valentines special menu\" what a disappointment, it was the same as the every day menu, nothing special (except one different desert) and they didn't allow you to order from the Happy Hour menu. So basically there was nothing special and the usually outstanding happy hour specials were not available. Might be time to try other restaurants in the are, maybe the keg or Blue Wasabi. Too bad, I really was looking forward to a little better offering from them."}
{"text":"Very busy Saturday night. 30 min. wait for 3 people. Mourn party ordered 2 salads and the Chicken Enchilada Stack.  The salad plates looked small but were deep...plenty of food all the way around. No room for desert. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my aunt and was very surprised. Its very spacious in here with lots of TVs around the bar. The food was a little pricier than normal but the servings are large and worth the money. Everything tasted great and lots of craft beers on tap. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed an outstanding dinner this evening at Thirsty Lion in Scottsdale. After drinks, we shared a crisp, perfectly prepared Caesar salad. For our main course, we shared the Romano herb crusted chicken with lemon-herb beurre blanc and capers, over creamy garlic noodles, accompanied by sauteed green beans and red bell peppers, and fresh dill.   Stephanie was our waitress, and she was just a perfect representative of Thirsty Lion. She was friendly, attentive, and responsive to our needs even before we told her. She already knew from paying close attention. We also had two highly positive contacts with the manager during our meal, and we were quite impressed with his hands-on management style.   Since we're nearby residents of Old Town Scottsdale, we will be able to return easily to Thirsty Lion. And, after tonight's fine outing, we will!"}
{"text":"AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!  Frequent here, WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN!!  Like the ambiance, food is inconsistent at best. Wait staff is hit or miss, mostly miss. Bar staff rocks, offering best service and personality. Sit at bar if you RISK coming here. The only redeeming thing about this place.  On occasions when I have teens w/me, we can't sit at the bar. Table service is ALWAYS a disaster. Ignored for lengthy times (even empty), order gets put in wrong, or not at all. Table service has never been good. NEVER. Not once. Bar is far superior.  Last visit (2 adults, 3 teens), 3 tables were seated after us by at least 5+ minutes. Not slammed busy, plenty of staff, we were served last. By the same waiter. Really???  Ordered 3 apps, some drinks. Tuna was the only thing edible. Actually, very good.  Most teens don't enjoy raw tuna, we got some basic easy stuff you'd think couldn't F up. WRONG!! HORRIBLY WRONG!! Queso dip and flatbread. Cheese dip was oily, grainy, salty, separating- TOTALLY INEDIBLE. Sat uneaten. When the waiter finally came around, mentioned it was totally inedible. \"Sorry you didn't like it.\" Flatbread, which we've enjoyed before, same thing, not edible. Not sure what the chef was thinking, but it wasn't food quality. We all had tried a piece, it appeared 1/2 eaten. However, those pieces were distributed among 5 plates, but remained uneaten except for the first bite or 2 to give it a shot. Mentioned to our waiter that the flatbread wasn't its norm, \"you ate half.\" Hmmm, can clearly see no one ate their piece on their plates, half still remains on serving board - that's your answer?? He knew we were in a rush to make a movie time. Asked for 2 out of 3 uneaten apps to be taken off the bill, obvious we didn't eat them. He replied manager was at shift meeting, it would be a while. Total BS. This guy knew we were in a rush to make a movie time. Also knew service was horrendous (in a corner, repeatedly forgotten). Not a doubt. Used that as an excuse to get us to pay the full bill, increasing his tip, avoiding getting busted for blah service.  I waited tables for years, I'm pretty empathetic to waitstaff. I get there are off days. Waitstaff doesn't cook the food, shouldn't be faulted for bad food. Even though he was a suck arse waiter, former waitress in me can't leave less than 20%, no matter what. Can't be that person. Bad karma. However, had he been worth his salt, not uncommon for me to leave 50-100% of the bill. Waited tables for years, I enjoy spreading love, showing appreciation for a job well done. Good karma.  Left 20% on a bill for cocktails and 3 apps, only 1 of was edible and correctly cooked (lol, basically raw tuna). Mentioned to have manager call me, pretty apparent message wouldn't be received. Mentioned if I didn't hear from them, I'd call to remove the 2 apps from bill, unacceptable to expect us to pay for those. Was told to ask for a specific person.  When I did so, they were never available. I'd ask for my call to be returned. NOTHING!! Not sure the person even exists, or is actually a manager. Think a friend CYA. Must commend cleverness. How about applying that to your work ethic?? Better results!  Like most, I have a busy life, can't chase down an unresponsive manager. Tried a couple times. BUPKISS. Fine, I'll just argue it on my credit card. Not my usual solution, but after such suck arse service all around, I'm just sick and tired of being taken advantage of and paying for truly SHIIT! Received a letter letting me know that the bank investigated and wouldn't be giving me a credit. Hmmm, never asked for any proof from me, which would be my phone bill proving my attempts to call the manager. Forced to escalate to an actual investigation where proof of follow up phone calls will be easily provided. Imagine my surprise that the manager had the time to argue my chargeback, but never had the time to contact a loyal customer.  I've forgiven their lame table service for years, I'm pretty mellow. What I cannot forgive is inferior food being served, obviously uneaten, and yet not removed from the bill. For the amount of around $20-25, they've lost a loyal customer. Great business acumen. Great management. Couple years of going there, never asked for a manager, $-60 of numerous issues - I WILL NEVER RETURN. Hope it was worth it. Given my charge card has a guarantee, I'll get the money eventually. But to make me put more energy into this than they ever did, ludicrous!!  This \"Gastropub\" will give you gastric problems and frustration. AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. Simply isn't worth it. Overpriced, underperforming, lackluster.  AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.  Don't say you weren't warned!! Simply not worth the higher prices for inferior food and table service."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch with the family while shopping. No expectation other than grab a bite. Surprised an intrigued by the menu. I ordered a Southwest grilled chicken salad and it was one of the best salads I've ever had! Best enjoyed outside with an iced tea. The rest of the family loved their meals as well. Service and food exceeded expectstions by a mile. We'll be back to try thr dinner meny!"}
{"text":"Two friends of mine and I came here during happy hour mid week. The place was pretty dead and we sat at the bar. It didn't seem to be low staffed but it took about ten minutes for us to get an order in. Then another ten or more to get the few appetizers we ordered. The pizza was pretty good and was definitely the saving grace to the night. The calamari was a much smaller portion than we expected and the hummus was terrible. It was almost a soupy consistency, like something out of a can. Weirdly enough, I might try coming back when they are busier for better service. They just seemed lazy that night. And I'd definitely only consider getting the pizza."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. My first time, I thought it was nothing special, food was regs, just another place to eat/drink. Probably a 3/5 AT MOST. But after this experience I'm never going back. This was the 2nd time in my life I've left no tip (left 2 bucks). My 3 hour dinner experience was the last one I will have here. My 30 min late(after everyone else got theirs) comped fish tacos were garbage. They were sitting there the whole time, I was told. They sucked regardless. The manager was one of our servers, he was garbage, complete idiot. Server was a dick, I'm never going back. I'm very sympathetic to people who work in this line of work, as I'm pretty lenient ( bring me my food and drink in a reasonable amount of time I'll give you a minimum of 25%). I realize it was Saturday night, but when tables around you arrive 30 min + after and leave 30 min+ before you (6 people in out party) I cannot and will not sympathize for you. Figure it out, your job is pretty straight forward and easy. If you can't do this, I fear for you future. Between the 6 of us we racked up around 200 dollars, the tip? A whopping 10 bucks that wasn't even deserved. Crap service = crap tip. Your welcome."}
{"text":"Service, service. Seems to be a complaint among reviewers and my review is no different. The hostess took my name and seated us quicker than expected. We were greeted promptly and our beverages served quickly. The waitress came back to ask if we wanted food, which we did until we realized the appetizer menu had nothing that was appetizing to us. That is where the service went downhill, very, very quickly. We still had full beers. She brought us our bill, cashed us out, and never returned. I sat there for probably another 30-40 minutes with no water.  Many, many years ago I was a waitress in college. I gave everyone the same service regardless if they ordered a milk or 7-course meal. When people eat out they expect service. Time is money and I realize that if I don't order food, 20% gratuity on nothing is nothing. However, I do tip for time. I realize if you have to refill my water (which costs nothing) it is still your time coming to my table to refill. I left 20% based on my bill, but had the waitress came and checked on us and refilled my water, I would have definitely made it worth her time. Very disappointing service."}
{"text":"Their happy hour specials are great because they have them on the weekends also.. I love the California rolls."}
{"text":"Worst service. Our server was a blond girl with long blond hair that was a little curly. I would post her name, but she never introduced herself to us. My husband waited while I was in the bathroom for five minutes for the waitress came over to take our order for drinks.   She was terrible. When she finally took our order, she ordered his beer incorrectly.  She never ran any of our food out, the place was not busy to warrant using a food runner, and when she brought the check, she didn't ask if we needed any change and didn't bring change back to us until we flagged her down and asked.  Lastly she didn't ask or offer us any bags for our to go boxes.   After all of this, the food was ok, but overpriced. I won't go back.  I'll just wait 6 months for it to close down and try the next restaurant that goes in."}
{"text":"I've been to Thirsty Lion twice now and both times I leave with an adequate experience. The food is good, but not great. The service is never spectacular. The restaurant is very dark and loud.  Last time we went, there was a Foosball tournament going on. (Which people were very serious about!) If you're looking for a place to hang out with your buddies and watch the game all day, it's probably appropriate. But for any other occasion I would choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great happy hour specials.  4 dollar wine...good wine!  Good sliders and flatbread.  Nice ambience."}
{"text":"Got there on a Saturday afternoon around 1 or so. Place wasn't packed and got right in. We had the charcuterie and scotch eggs with a couple of the micro beers. Food was very good. My only complaint was there could have been a bit more of the cheese and crusty bread on the charcuterie. Other than that we enjoyed it. The server was very helpful on beer selections and could not have been friendlier.  It is a chain restaurant but only in AZ, CO, and Oregon (I believe). So for a chain we were pleasantly surprised. The price is a little bit high compared to other similar places. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the whole place is quite large. Did remind me of an english pub. Except I have never seen a \"Pub\" quite that big Scotch eggs were a delight as was the spicy mustard they came with."}
{"text":"We have been going to Thirsty Lion at Fashion Square for a few months now. Outstanding happy hour and food... Pretty reasonable prices for Old Town Scottsdale...  We always order the Chopped Kale salad (awesome) and the Garlic Sesame Edamame... We are very sensitive to too much garlic, and this edamame is perfect.   Highly reccomeded!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is dark wood, dim lights like a more expensive restaurant but lots of TVs and bustle to remind you it is really a sports bar.   Good burgers and beer selections.  Large menu from bar food to steak.  Can get crowded on weekends especially if there is a football game or other events like graduation, students move in etc at nearby Arizona State University"}
{"text":"First visit, we were seated way in the back and were never served so we walked out. Second reluctant visit, we were served but never received our check. We then waited up front to pay but no one ever came up to ask if we needed help despite making eye contact with a few servers. So, we walked out."}
{"text":"To start I love that they play music vids and not just sports on all the tvs!!  The chicken nachos were amazing! So Smokey and packed full of toppings. The topping chip ratio was perfect. All the other food was good, nothing to truly remember but all good. The service was the best. I wish I had gotten her name. She was very attentive and always said cheers after she brought our drinks. Just friendly and personable without being too chatty. Would definately return."}
{"text":"The grapefruit basil martini was excellent.  The shrimp ceviche was very good but the portion was very small for the price. The burger sliders on the appetizer menu were delicious but there were only 2 of them. The atmosphere and decor were very nice. I will go back."}
{"text":"The food it good but the service is a hit or miss.  Some nights it is great and others we hardly see our waiter.  We go here for the large selection beer and TVs.  They make great mixed drinks too!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend finished watching a movie today around 615. Seated very quickly at the patio area which was very nice for people watching. Waited 20 minutes, no service. None at all, not even someone to say that they would be right with our table or someone to fill up some water. The restaurant wasn't that busy so don't know what the deal was. I could have called for the manager. One rule I go by is not to anger the people that make your food. Too bad the service was nonexistent. I watch many movies at Harkins and Thirsty Lion would probably have been a great stop for a pint and and some food. Went to the Yard House and got great food and great service. You lost a potential customer, great job!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and I have to say that I have never been disappointed.   Thirsty lion has a great environment that caters to most. Bar patrons. Dinner goers or maybe even just desert.   After a failed attempt to eat at Gen Korean BBQ we ended up at thirsty lion. I immediately noticed they changed their menu yet again. I knew this because one of my favorite items, the charcuterie board was not on the menu.   The appeal with changing the menu is that it kind of feels like you are eating at a different restaurant each time.  We went with the smoked chicken nachos. The banh mi sliders and the pear and prosciutto flatbread.   I really enjoyed the sliders. They were different and very flavorful. However the nachos were to die for. I would probably have to say they were the best nachos I have ever eaten. And of course the flatbread is always a sold choice.   The waitress could have been a little more patient with us but overall It's always a good time at The Thirsty Lion."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out for Happy Hour, and was very impressed!  My friend and I were seated immediately on their great patio.  All of the staff was incredibly friendly.  There are TONS of food specials from $3.95 - $5.95.  We had the Pulled Pork Sliders, the Burger Sliders, the Chicken Tenderloins, and the Pub Fries.  All of it was delicious.  Not to mention incredibly tasty $4 Margaritas.  YUM.  This is a PERFECT spot for before or after shopping or checking out a movie at Scottsdale Fashion Square.    ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Love the Tempe location but San Tan needs some serious help with service. I get they are brand new but the lack of staff is ridiculous. Even at the bar all 6 bartenders walked with their heads down without any engagement with patrons. Very sad since atmosphere is fun and I know menu is great from other locations."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad.... some items on the menu are better than others. Not really sure what to say here except, the beers cold, service is good (some better than others) and the food is edible! I don't have anything negative nor over the top to write about here, but it's a decent meal!"}
{"text":"This is how a restaurant should be. Exceptionally staffed. A lively spirit and yet comfortable to chat in. Food is excellent and your choice of drink that will keep you coming back for more. I love both locations I have been to. Tempe and Gilbert. Keep it up mates!  Cheers"}
{"text":"Note: Gastropub  (awesome food, upscale bar)  This is a THE NICEST venue at the Tempe Market Place. You can not find better service. Food is fall of the bone tasty. Drinks are top notch. I have been here several times and NEVER been disappointed in any way. Manager is always running around checking on the staff and food. Servers are attentive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this place for everything from a romantic date to a happy hour with bros.  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is fine, but really this reminds me of every corporate chain watering hole / restaurant that I have ever visited. In fact, 25-30 years ago it would have been another Bennigan's or a TGI Fridays.  Now I'm not saying that this is bad, but it is what it is. You know going in that the service will be professional and the food will be good, but not great. There's certainly a place for these type of chains, but it's not necessarily the first place I would think of to visit.  However, if you're looking for a bite to eat or something to drink, you can definitely count on The Thirsty Lion to fill that need."}
{"text":"There aren't many places at Tempe Marketplace that 1) Have great food 2) Manage to escape the feeling you're at a douchebag convention (Looking at you Cadillac Ranch). Thirsty Lion Pub just opened at Tempe Marketplace right next to Kabuki in the spot Maria Maria used to be in.   Sitting at the bar and looking at the menu at first glance, its a little bit overwhelming - they have everything from sushi to pizza to sandwiches to hamburgers kitchen sinks and lions and bears, oh my. But that's par for the course at brew pub restaurants in the area. I ordered a soda to start and wasn't impressed by how it was instantly flat. My friend was also not taken by how odd and underwhelming their cold water was. I eventually ordered a Green Chiles Chicken Sandwich with guacamole and onions and tomatoes and cheese; my friend ordered a vegetable panini.   Ambience-wise, the music and sports are not overwhelming to conversation. They play the usual generic easy listening rock garbage designed not to offend or impress you'd hear at any sports bar (Nickleback, Spin Doctors, Springsteen). The odd thing here is that the TVs at the bar play videos of the songs and these are big nice TVs and the videos are pixelized and fuzzy as all get out, not looking even close to hi-res and freezing up on occassion. This might be some video/music delivery service issue, but its noticeable and odd. The place is massive and can hold a lot of people and large parties and seems to go on forever.  Our food came out promptly and I was pretty pleased. My sandwich was great and the guacamole was awesome, not overpowering and not bland. It was served on a ciabatta that was a nice consistency, not too soft and not too hard and the chicken was great. My friend also enjoyed her sandwich, although it had aragula and they didnt cut the stems which seems odd. Having once been stabbed in the throat by an errant cilantro stem once upon a time I can say chop those stems in the future.  So, consensus, food was really good, we could chat and it was delivered promptly. Drinks were flat, but servers were nice and courteous."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and unfortunately probably my last.  I'm torn between a 2 and 3 star but because the service was great, I went with a 3 star.  The food was good for bar food and the service was great.  It's a REALLY  big place which is great and they have an amazing selection of beer and food.  The only down sides were my dishes and silverware were dirty, like noticeably dirty.  Black stuff on my form and a black stain on my plate.  This is pretty stomach turning than goodness I'm not a germaphobe or it would have been all over for me.  I tried to get over it but the whole time I was eating I just was wondering how could you not notice a big black stain on a small app plate?    The food was tasty, a twist on bar food.  We had the bbq wrapped prawns, french dip and fries and I had a pom and goat cheese salad.  The food was good however, it left us with upset stomachs all night.  All in all I will probably never go back, which kinda sucks but there are too many places especially in Tempe Marketplace to pay for such a disappointing and slightly disgusting experience."}
{"text":"I've been here on a couple of different occasions with my boyfriend for lunch.  I've shared and sampled a few of their sandwiches which have all been very diverse from one another and have great ingredient and flavor profiles.  I would recommend this place for lunch and/or happy hour.  The full bar is extensive and they have a great outdoor space when the weather permits dining al fresco.  The service is a little hit or miss with the younger girls who tend to be the servers, but if you get a good one the overall experience should be nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar.  The employees all had an attitude like you were bothering them. None of the bartenders were friendly at all.  Could have been a decent place to hang out but with the attitude problems we most likely will not go back"}
{"text":"We went in for drinks. The place is nice and so is thr staff. Our drinks werr good and we tried the nacho appetizer with spicy chicken. It tasted amazing! Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for food only. The service kinda sucked. We like to sit at the bar specifically because the bar tender is always there to talk to or just if you need anything. We were the only people at the bar and the bar tender was never here. Our appetizer plate sat in front of us the entire time we ate our entrees. We also had no app plates or silverware or napkins until we were almost done with the appetizer. She would disappear for 15 minutes at a time multiple times. She said she worked at the Tempe location for 4 years so I'm shocked at the lack of customer service. My husband was a server for 6 years and I was a server and bar tender for 10 years so we know how it should be. The edamame was delicious. Fish tacos were delicious. My husband had the tavern burger and he loved it and was happy they understood what medium rare is BC every time he gets one ordered that way it comes out well done. Would have given 5 stars if service was better...the bar tender was really nice even tho she wasn't visible very much."}
{"text":"Ordered the corned beef and cabbage as part of their St Patrick's day promotion. It had a nasty mustard sauce like I've never had before on CBC. Potatoes tasted like instant and cabbage was not the least bit good. Corned beef was very tough. My husband loved the fish tacos. Never was able to track down our server for a second drink or even more water. She never checked on us once during the meal, all four of us would have loved a second drink. It was a disappointment in an evening with friends. Won't return."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the manager Brian was an asshole. He was rude to the cute adorable bartender Aprille, he charged us more after she already gave us our bill. He was so mean to her on the floor which we noticed. Talk about horrible customer service. I'm all for making sure employees are doing their jobs right but don't reprimand them on the floor. I highly suggest giving Brian the boot and getting a manager that can actually do their job properly. Bartender was so nice and the food was amazing....manager was a dick. Partially ruined the experience."}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion, is large, dark open and well appointed. This is not a college bar.   There is one large bar a the center of the place that is open all the time, and a smaller bar on the left side that is probably only open when it is very busy.    The staff was very good, our bartender Adam was friendly and knowledgeable and the waitresses were friendly and helpful.  The manager stopped by and made sure everything was alright because my friend left some food on his plate, she was concerned he didn't like the pulled pork, but that wasn't the case at all.    The fresh cut fries were nice and crisp.    The cheeseburger had a great grill taste with no gas flavor.  The pulled pork smelled smoky and fantastic and my friend really enjoyed.  I had a small sample and it was tasty and juicy.  The Lion has 52 beers on tap with a strong selection of American beers (Green Flash IPA?  Yeah, it was good) but I wish they had a few more British beers and Ciders (Fuller's London's Pride or ESB maybe?)."}
{"text":"Went here after work on a Wednesday night, Angel was our bartender and she was amazing! So personable and friendly, a reason to go back. We'll see you soon Angel!!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try the new restaurant in SanTan Village and arrived at 4:15pm on a Saturday. Got seated right away but we never got waited on so we left after 10 minutes.  Other patron sitting next to us said the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Cheap happy hour appetizers. Enjoyed the quality of the calamari which is hard to find. The pear flat bread was equally delicious. Had the orange chicken for our entree, beautiful split-plate, delivered to my girlfriend and I by the chef. Good seasonal dessert, caramel apple cheesecake. Overall, really impressed with the food and service."}
{"text":"We visited this location for the first time this weekend and it was excellent!  Service was fast and friendly - bartenders went out of their way to make sure our food and drinks were on point.  We loved the scotch eggs - they were an awesome start - soft egg & nice crunch on the outer sausage & breaded crust and spicy mustard finish - yum!  We split the spicy burger with jalapenos, guac, pepperjack, etc - great as well - burger was juicy & cooked perfectly and tasted fresh - side of fries seemed fresh cut as well.  Finish off with a piece of starwberry/rubarb cheesecake - crazy light fluffy awesomeness!   Drinks were great for us too - Vino & cider (Plenty of beer options).  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Everyone I ordered was sooooo good...the bacon wrapped dates are a must have I find myself craving them all the time haha...service was okay but it was really busy..of course I'll be going back..alot more often"}
{"text":"Good bar. Good food. I've done several work happy hours and it is always a good atmosphere. Plenty of open space. High tops near the bar. Staff is attentive. Plenty of different beers on tap. I've never had a bad meal. Burger sliders, ahi tuna salad, Baja fish tacos, scotch eggs... Its allll good."}
{"text":"What a disappointing dinner. Asked for red sauce with the calamari appetizer but it only came out with some kind of creamy sauce. Asked again for red sauce and after a long wait our waitress came back with cocktail sauce. Explained to her that we wanted marinara sauce (Isn't that what usually comes with calamari?) After another long wait she returned with a cup of ice cold marinara sauce. By this time the calamari was cold too. When I ordered my entree I specifically asked if the \"southwest grilled chicken \" in the salad was at all spicy and the waitress said no. After a few bites my mouth felt like it was on fire. When I told the waitress that the chicken was spicy she said that she didn't think it was but they cook it with peppers so that could make it spicy. Wish she had said that when I ordered it. Then she took my plate away and didn't even ask if I wanted anything else instead. A few minutes later she brought us the check without even asking if we wanted dessert. Really expected more from a restaurant with a 4 star rating on Yelp."}
{"text":"If you want real food with flavor find a mom and pop shop! If you enjoy the big box restaurant atmosphere of an Applebee's with edible food at twice the price come here. our waitress was friendly and fast but the food was just umm edible. I had a french dip which was dry and flavorless and my husband had the Mediterranean burger which was undercooked. If a restaurant claims to be a \"gastro\" anything I would have expected that even their humblest offerings would still have great flavor. All the food seemed prepackaged... I've had better flavor and more satisfaction  eating a stouffer's frozen dinner."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was very pleasant. We sat on the patio which is pretty good sized with the option to sit near the street, mall courtyard or at the bar. Good selection of beers and burger options. Three of the four of us opted for burgers which were cooked nicely to order, very moist and flavorful. There was alway someone coming by asking if we needed anything and how we were doing. Didn't have to wait and look for our waitress as it was a tag team service....... nice"}
{"text":"Great food by far...  The service was average and atmosphere was good. Pricing was little above average. With all this said... I will come back for awesome food!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some drinks & sat at the bar.  Randy took care of us.  I tried the New Belgium Tartastic which was decent and refreshing especially since it was still 100 degrees outside at 9:30pm.  Not sure about he happy hour which was supposed to be going from 9:30pm - close.  Didn't seem like we got the $1 off drafts when I looked at our check.  Otherwise it was an ok laid back atmosphere.  Didn't have any food so not sure about their culinary delights."}
{"text":"I like this location much better than the one in Gilbert. This particular location has service that is speedy with food orders and drinks."}
{"text":"Good destination if you're planning on meeting friends at Tempe Marketplace. Lot of beers to choose from, decent size menu.  Go during happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is just so so.  We ordered a variety of appetizers and they tasted decent but not memorable enough to want to go back a second time.   The dinks were yummy and well made.  Service was below average which was surprising since it was pretty empty when we were there on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. The best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had. I could have made a meal out of this dip.  I could dab it behind each ear. Ok, I loved it.  Followed it up with Roast Cubano Pork sandwich. Good. But did I mention the Dip?"}
{"text":"I love this place, my husband and I have gone here a number of times and have always had great service. A little pricey for a \"bar\" type place but totally worth it. Their seasonal specials are always great too!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  Sat outside.  It was beautiful.  They also have a round table with a fire pit.  We had a group of 8.  Beer was served quickly but I had to ask 3 times for a Diet Coke.  I got the jalapeño burger.  It was very good but over cooked.  Medium-well to well when I asked for medium rare.  Fries were a bit overdone.   $51.00 (including tip) for a burger, chicken sandwich, two beers and a Diet Coke."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty expansive so it's a good place to come with larger party's or picky eaters because of the array. I have had the pizza and cheeseburger and most of my visits the food has been proper. Drinks from the bar can take a little while. Came in at 930 on a Sunday, so it was hardly crowded and it still took almost 10 minutes. A good selection of drinks and more than 1 cidre option, since that's all I drink.  Atmosphere is nice, music on that isn't typical canned style music so it keeps the indoor atmosphere lively. Patio outside is very nice spot as well. Service is average on all my visits. Not encountered any rudeness and all have been accommodating to my food requests. Prices are decent, a little more expensive dinner price but when the food comes out well it is do-able. Great place to meet with friends without feeling like you are at a casual bar/restaurant scene."}
{"text":"My posts are typically food related and I pen reviews for only   locally owned and/or small businesses and restaurants.  However, I feel compelled to mention a bar/restaurant that consistently provides great food and even better service.  The Thirsty Lion at Fashion Square has never let me down.  After a number of visits over the past few years (they host our basketball Watch parties) they have never disappointed me or our group of rabid College Hoops fans.  Excellent food and superb service are tough to come by at restaurants as big as the Thirsty Lion.  But they somehow, against the odds, provide both.  Last night Titus (our server) and Sean (the Aussie manager) performed above and beyond the call of duty.  But I/we've come to expect their attention to detail.  If you're in Scottsdale. Please give them a try....."}
{"text":"We were just in Monday evening and had a great experience! We sat on the patio, it really has a great vibe out there.  It was pretty packed but we had excellent service from Sammi, she was an awesome server! Really attentive, always filling our waters and making sure we had everything we needed. She recommend the shrimp risotto (which I had and it was super tasty) we really had a fantastic experience thanks to the great service and we will definitely be back to Thirsty Lion!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at the Thirsty Lion. Food was great, and the service was excelente. The atmosphere was nice and relax. Maybe because it was Easter Sunday.   This location also has TV's all around with cool sliding windows and outside seating. Perfect for nice fresh air, which wont last for long once summer time comes around, but luckily we were able to enjoy the fresh air while sitting inside.   As for my meal, I enjoyed the Jalapeño Pepper Jack Burger and my wife enjoyed the Classic Reuben with Turkey. She loved it and we'll definitely be back to enjoy some of the scrumptious looking items that we didn't get a chance to get to. That said, I truly recommend this location to all but also to those looking to enjoy good food/drinks while watching a sporting event.   This place is 'Primetime'!  Ps. Shoutout to Katie for her great service."}
{"text":"Too large of a menu means they don't do anything well.  We've tried 3 times because we figured at first they were working out the kinks and that's why food was average and service was slow. Guess the kinks never got worked out because they are consistently below average. I love local craft beer and they do have a good selection. I tried the house margarita last time because it was 1/2 off if the temperature was above 105 degrees and it was well over. I asked for a pour to taste-not to get sloshed. It wasn't well balanced and taste was ok. Plus, they didn't just give me the 1/2 price, I had to ask for it.  We've tried various appetizers and nothing stood out as good. We've tried a few meals - and again nothing stood out. I hear the salads are good.  But I am usually not a salad eater at restaurants.  They get 2 stars for location. I like a beer at happy hour before a movie at Santan Harkins."}
{"text":"DON'T GO!!!! after giving this place more than a second chance this place was a horrible experience each time.  Our last experience we get there and there is a big sign stating the times of happy hour.  We were in the time frame so we were excited and even the host said it was happy hour.  When we ordered the waitress said it wasn't happy hour b/c it was mothers day (WTF) and the place was dead.  After trying to eat horrible food and drinking overpriced drinks we gave our waitress a $25 gift card (which we had received at our last experience after waiting over an hour for our food) The waitress came back and said there was only $20 on the gift card not $25 even though it said $25 on the card and we had never used it.  What a joke.  If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"We came here on accident soon after moving to AZ, and boy are we glad we did. We seriously LOVE this restaurant - delicious food, good service, tasty beverages. What more can you ask for? The menu options are expansive without being overwhelming. I've had the BBQ (I think?) burger (it's the one with the onion straws and white cheddar cheese), beer cheese soup, soft pretzel; the boy has had (and is in LOVE with) the potato cakes (happy hour only, sadly...) and gets those almost every time we go.  We've been numerous times with visitors and just ourselves, and we are SO EXCITED that there is one opening in Gilbert so we'll be closer to home."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I would definitely order the Tavern Burger again but... the service sucked!  This is why I only gave it 2 stars.  There were 3 of us and when we have to wait 5 minutes for drinks thats a little long in my book.  Everything was slow from the drinks, food, and even check getting to us.    I may give this place a second chance just to see if it was an off day."}
{"text":"Service awful!  Decent menu selection along with adult beverages.  After a long week we wanted a date night out but it was impossible to get acknowledged by the bartenders! Don't worry everyone else was being helped around us.  No warmth in the interactions I witnessed.  I saw the bartender look at my empty drink twice but never came around. Never offered a menu. Maybe a smile would be nice too!"}
{"text":"Walking around the area with a friend when we decided to check this place out. We just went in for a few drinks but decided to get some food, wasn't too bad but wasn't the best. Had some sort of Irish egg that was pretty decent but the rest of our appetizers weren't too good. Service was mediocre for not being so busy."}
{"text":"The first time I came here for dinner before I movie, I expected run-of-the-mill, chain restaurant quality food, but I was pleasantly surprised by my delicious burger. I went back a couple months later expecting the same exceptional quality when I ordered the cobb salad, but I was extremely disappointed with what I got. Generally cobbs are pretty hard to mess up- just throw some egg, avocado, bacon, and tomatoes on and you've got a great salad! But came out of the kitchen was the saddest excuse for cobb I've ever seen. It was mostly lettuce with barely any dressing. Really not acceptable for a salad that was over $10."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! We go there almost weekly for the amazing food, beverages and atmosphere. The staff is always very friendly and have gotten to know us as regulars. Highly recommend going there for a fun date night or to just chill with friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing corned beef and hash, the ONLY thing that was a miss was they were shaving heads (hair) to raise money for cancer, which I get, it's a great thing, but you should NOT do it around people eating food! I found hairs in my dish, but they took care of it on my bill. So thank you to them. Other than that, great place and I will be back (hopefully when the barbers are not around)"}
{"text":"nope. nope nope nope nope nope nope.  service was poor and every beer i asked for they were out of. i dont want to sit here and write a long, bitchy review so i'll just go with this: never coming here again. the end."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat at fashion square, food quality is great! Always very nice people as well!"}
{"text":"I can hardly understand when you get charged for a 9 oz glass of wine at $11 when I only wanted the $8 glass instead. Waitress said they always ASSUME  you want the more expensive one. Really! That is not how I assume your tip that you wanted nothing for your effort. What a absolute poor practice"}
{"text":"Love this place. It has become a place I go with my girlfriends regularly. They have so many beers on tap and even cider. This is great because I have a friend who has a gluten allergy so she can get her cider fix. The food as well is awesome. From the apps to the entrees you cannot go wrong. The bartenders and servers are prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I came and sat on the patio.  The misters felt great in heat of the summer.  I ordered the shrimp tacos that are supposed to be their signature piece and they were AWFUL!  I am a shrimp taco connoisseur.  I know a good taco.  The first bite made me want to vomit.  Good seafood shouldn't have an odor.  I sent them back and ordered the sausage with mac and cheese.  I also ordered a Moscow Mule and there was no alcohol.  I could only taste the ginger beer.  $9 for a weak drink?  Super disappointed with the overall experience and won't be going back.  The tempe location is much much better."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow.  My son and I both ordered Orange chicken; his came out very saucy and mine came out dry, no sauce like it had been sitting in the window.  Needless to say, very disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't go to sports bars because quite frankly I don't like sports. This place is awesome, though. Great drink menu, super friendly and knowledgeable staff, amazing food. I had a flatbread that was really great. Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"SOLID...just solid.  The food won't change your life, but it will definitely make your night.  Great selection of quality dishes and drafts under one very large roof.  Definitely something for everyone and a comfortable atmosphere with lots of space for even the biggest parties.  Service is hit or miss, unfortunately, but I always leave feeling good regardless.  B+"}
{"text":"Talk about disappointing....after giving this place 5 stars on Saturday for lunch, I went back with my coworkers last night for Happy Hour.  A few of us arrived at about 3:30 and the place was almost empty.  We let the hostess know that we were going to have a group of about 8 people for HH.  She asked if we had reservations and was a little irritated that we didn't.  Now this place is huge inside and it was empty at 3:30, I thought her attitude was a little uncalled for.  We were surprised that it did start getting very busy at about 5:00 and the place filled up as she said it would.  So keep in mind you should make reservations for HH even on a Tuesday....who would have thunk it?  I didn't see our waitress Ashley that has been so great on Saturday, so we got Elena.  She said she was new so wasn't real familiar with the HH specials.  Service was very slow, the drinks and simple HH food took forever to arrive.  One of my coworkers ordered an appetizer and when asked later where it was, Elena responded that she thought she'd forgotten to place the order.  In Elena's defense, she was new and most of the service related issues were probably out of her hands.  I would probably come back for lunch again if I was in the area, but would go somewhere else for HH.  There's a lot of other places to choose from in the same area."}
{"text":"Came here on St. Patrick's Day with my man. The food was terribly overpriced and portions were very small. The corned beef was delicious but we were not satisfied given the amount of food we got.  We had to finish our meal off with an appetizer which was actually more filling than our expensive entrees.  On top of that, I felt they were being very stingy with the amount of Guinness they were pouring us ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!  My black velvets were at least 85% cider with a splash if Guinness.  I had to ask the bartender to fix them.  No specials on beer or their \"specials\" menu (all of the items were the same price on their regular menu) and we had to pay a cover to get in.  It wasn't even that busy as it was on a weekday this year.   Only two stars because the food was tasty."}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion! My main squeeze calls it 'The Lannister Bar.' I really love this place. It has a great ambiance, the beer selection is awesome. I love IPA's and they have a fine array of them here! We have always had great service, and their food is wonderful. They have what might be the best salad of all time here! It has Kale, chicken, yummy extras and a glorious dressing! I devour this salad whenever we go. Last time we went I used open table and we got seated right away, even though there were people waiting. We always have fun and leave happy!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and service varies usually it is not very good. We went on April 15 and our waitress was great and the manager was friendly.  Unfortunately as usual, it took really long to get a veggie panini and cheeseburger. We arrived at 11:15 and did not get our food until a little after 12 and there were not too many customers when we arrived but certainly increased by noon. Not sure why it took so long to get our food. So it seems every time we go here it takes forever to get our food so if you are rrrreally hungry, I would keep that it mind  for us vegetarians, they do have vegetarian items for you! The veggie panini is okay comes out \"warm\" but wish it was hot...melt that cheese  and it would be super yummy! Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and slightly passable food.  I am pretty certain our waiter Johnathan was purposely ignoring our table.  He would refuse to make eye contact and walk around us without even acknowledging us as we were staring right at him and at times we were even calling his name.  He was more interested in watching TV than taking care of us.  The food was anything but gastropub quality.  We had a variety of items from pizza, to burgers, to appetizers.  Every single thing we tried was mediocre bar food.  I expected so much more from the description this place gives itself.  The pizza was on par with frozen grocery store type but much smaller.  The burger was probably the better item of the bunch.  The fries were limp and soft.    Don't get me started on pub that doesn't even offer wings.  This place is going to fail miserably and rightfully so.  Especially next to Yardhouse, Kona, and ZTejas.  Would never come back and never recommend."}
{"text":"Sean and Lexi , you rock! Consistently great food and service, this YELP really sucks thank Goodness the food is great"}
{"text":"Went here for my girls bday and they gave her dessert and a signed card from the staff. They also remembered our names on our walk out. Food was good, maybe a little pricey but it's a great atmosphere. Very friendly! Good effort in keeping patrons happy"}
{"text":"I normally stay far away from chain restaurants. However, I live in the neighborhood and got a coupon in the mail for my birthday month. BOGO entree up to 20.00. So, we thought we'd try it. I would totally go back!! Coupon worked!! LOL.   Our server was the perfect mix of attentive, helpful, kind and invisible! I got the Gilled Atlantic Salmon which was EXCELLENT! My date got the pulled pork sandwich, also EXCELLENT. Their fries are good too! What surprised us most was that i assumed since my meal was 20.00 and his was 14.00, that we'd get the lesser meal free with our coupon. Nope, they actually gave my 20.00 entree. They also brought us a desert. That was also very smart of them because it was DELICIOUS, and I'd totally go there for the desert.   Place is clean, aesthetically pleasing, engaged staff and great food. What more could you want!?  P.S.The craft cocktails are not their bailiwick. Stick with the great selection of fresh beers."}
{"text":"I came in with my fiancee for a quick bite with a few friends.  It was easy to spot my friends from the moment I walked in.  This place is like one giant room.  There are TV's and Music Vidoes playing, but not so loud that you can't have a conversation with your friends.  We were sitting at a 6 person high-top and had no trouble chatting over the music.    We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was happy hour, and there are a bunch of cheap appetizers.  (Sorry, I can't remember when exactly happy hour is...we met around 5ish)  My fiancee and I ordered the french fries and California roll to split.  The fries are good, but the California roll was super delicious and a large portion!  I might have to come back to try more of the sushi, because I was not expecting that it would be so good.  The service was very good as well.  Our waitress was very attentive, even though our group ordered only appetizers and water.  Our glasses were never empty and our empty plates were taken away in a timely manner.  I would recommend this place for a casual hangout, and will surely be back again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for dinner the other night with a friend.  I was surprised that for a Friday night it wasn't as busy as I thought, we were able to get seated immediately, which was great.   For starters, we chose to get their chipotle hummus and flatbread, which was actually really tasty.  I ended up getting the mac n cheese and my friend got their cheeseburger. Their was a lot of food and we couldn't even finish it because we were so full.   I looked at their happy hour menu and the prices were really reasonable. Next time I'll stop by during that time for sure!"}
{"text":"too bad there is no more than 5 stars,,,so I will add on stars..**************************************** I had lunch with friends today, they have not been there, and I go with the HH, but went for lunch , and just as great.. had Anthony as our  server, and , very professional, and great attitude.When I ordered coffee, I asked if they serve espresso, and they don't , but I wanted real strong coffee, and not \"Piss Water\" in which most restaurant serve, he went way up and beyond to make sure, my coffee was strong...excellent.. Than I asked to talked to the manager, name is Robert,to let him know how happy i was with Anthony, feeling he deserve a high double 5, and to make sure he gets recognize. Great manager too... Thanks again..TL, you have been totally fantastic. See you again...in the very near future...:)"}
{"text":"Terrible service - waitress never came by for refills of drinks. Food was uninspiring. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to have a drink here for a friends birthday. It was nice, I liked the atmosphere and the waiter was attentive. I felt bad because it was a very large group but I think the staff did a great job getting everything out to us. They even split the bill 100 different ways! My drink was good, can't wait to try the food!"}
{"text":"Burgers..wonderful, huge and yummy! Fries..to die for. Rueben sliders..fab (and less than five bucks at happy hour) This is a big place, with lots of TV's and noise, but the atmosphere is nice, and the personnel, great! They have a great selection of beer, as well as wine (good wines, too) and great happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"The service gets 5 stars, and the food wasn't bad either. Our only complaint was the dipping sauce for the French dip was too salty. Otherwise great atmosphere and staff!"}
{"text":"Great service. Our waitress didn't write anything down but got all our orders right. There was 11 of us. Jalapeño burger was yum. The fries not so much. I like my fries crispy and they were hard"}
{"text":"I do not like places that do not offer a separate lunch menu. There is lunch and there is dinner, the prices for lunch need to be cheaper than dinner, any restaurant chain that has not gotten the message by now needs a brain check. I came for another date so there was no turning back, but there should have been due to the one menu policy. The $10 hamburger was average and the side portion of cole slaw was not well executed and tiny. This place has finally achieved one star status due to corporate greed at happy Hour and now lunch as well. date was boring too"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here!  Great menu, great prices, and good service.  Really unique restaurant -- will definitely return. Try the prosciutto flatbread."}
{"text":"First time trying the Scotch Eggs yesterday and they were delicious.  Also tried the calamari, shrimp wrapped with bacon, spicy tuna roll....which were pretty standard....  Great place to hang out with colleagues for Happy Hour....I would try it again...  I'm still forgetting to check-in using yelp..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Gilbert for great food and drinks!! I love the atmosphere this bar has! The service is excellent. Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and drinks. The fillet is amazing. I have also had the pretzel bites w/cheese, which do not disappoint. As for drinks, they make a mean Moscow mule and their mojitos are delicious. Don't forget to top off your meal with the brownie dessert. This is a must try :)"}
{"text":"A lot better than I expected, which was a nice surprise! Came here to meet some friends after the work on a Friday evening.   Husband and I both ordered the cheeseburger with cheddar, no bun and salads for our sides. The burgers were a decent size, well seasoned, and cooked to our liking which almost always never happens!! Only wished the salads were slightly bigger and better dressed (cesar salad)   This was my first time coming here and definitely will be visiting again in the near future."}
{"text":"Love this place! We come here a lot to watch a basketball game and get some drinks. The only down side is the food prices are kinda high for the food you get. The food is good, just not amazing. If you're looking for a fun place to drink and get some bar food, this will fit the bill."}
{"text":"I visited this location Saturday, 03 SEP 2016 AD at approximately 7:20 PM. We had to wait for 15 minutes which wasn't bad for a Saturday night. The atmosphere was lively, the service was good and the food was delicious. I had a pizza and my wife had the Vegetarian burger; both were delicious.  The beer selection was OK - not a lot of foreign beers. The pricing was decent - we had a great time. I will return."}
{"text":"An absolutely awesome place to eat! Service is good and the food is even better! Scotch eggs are a must to try!! If you like a twist on normal food then you must go here! Never a bad choice on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I know this location has been a thousand things before it was Thirsty Lion, but can we talk about something for a second? HOW COZY IS THE LAYOUT? Does anyone else feel like they have been transported to Ireland into a tavern tucked away in a neighborhood with cobblestone streets? Or maybe its got a Hogwarts feel and I just really want to be a wizard.   Either way-- This Thirsty Lion beats all other locations. We stopped in after our movie to grab a bite because boyf told me I would not be cooking. Our server was sweet and understanding that we probably wouldn't be her most profitable table because we had just eaten our weight in popcorn, but wanted to grab a salad and a glass of wine, and enjoy the OH SO GORGEOUS weather and sit on the 'You're a wizard Harry' patio that is Thirsty Lion Fashion Square.  Reading the other reviews in the side panel, I now wish I had stopped into the \"fancy British bathrooms\" because I am sure it would have convinced me I had stepped into a time continuum on the escalator out of the theatre. Neither here nor there.   Anyway, 500000 stars for the build out done on the space. Salad was caesar and nothing to write home about, will return and try something to give a real rating for. 5 stars for great Sauvignon Blanc because good wine is good wine. 5 stars to the movie we saw because it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Definitely great ambience with the German fans during the World Cup finals!   Although the best was their service! Despite the loud crowd and the number of people crowded in the bar, the service was excellent! Our server took really good care of us with frequent checkups. That was impressive!  Food was good - but I like this pub/bar for the service - truly dependable each and every time!"}
{"text":"Great food. 52 different beers. I would recommend to watch games or just to eat. Cyrene brûlée was great"}
{"text":"Met up with some former classmates here to catch up and to grab a bite to eat. Tempe was central for all of us so we decided on Thirsty Lion since we met up here before.   We were quickly seated on a Sunday afternoon and our server was really efficient and nice. I started my meal with a mimosa and when our server brought it to the table, he has asked me if my mimosa was okay the way it was (it probably had just a splash of orange juice). I told him it was perfect! Most places dilute their mimosas with too much orange juice.   Since we were sitting at a high top and the stools did not have a back to it for me to hang my purse, I looked for a purse hook under the table. I couldn't find it but the server pointed it out to us later. It was farther than my short arms could reach so you have to lean over a little to find it in the middle of the table.   I decided to go with the Thai Shrimp & Noodle Salad for my meal that was on their seasonal specialties menu. Perfect for the warm weather we have going on now in Arizona. The shrimp was seasoned very well and there is definitely a spicy kick to the salad that complemented it nicely. It comes with shredded coconut but I wasn't really feeling it yesterday so I asked for my salad without the coconut. While it was a yummy salad, I felt like there should have been more greens and less noodles.  Even though I am trying to work on my beach body for summer, I did not turn down dessert. A friend and I split the brownie dessert. It was scrumptious and I would totally get it again. Perfectly chewy and loved the nuts on top.   Overall, great spot for lunch or dinner at Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"I went to the Thirsty Lion for the first time last night. We sat at the bar and it was great! Good food, drinks, and service. We had the pretzel and cheese dip, and the cheese dip was very good. We'll have to come back for happy hour soon"}
{"text":"I had a smoked chicken Waldorf type salad for dinner and the chicken was undercooked as the texture was disgusting as I ate it. I didn't want to be rude and spit out my food so I ate it but stopped eating the chicken after the bite I had. It cause me to have food poisoning and a large amount of gastrointestinal stress including vomiting all night long. It also caused me to have to take off work so very unhappy with the food!   Update: After my experience, I was contacted by the general manager, Jeff R., who was apologetic for my experience and asked how I was doing. He called me on a few occasions to check back in with me and did offer to have me come back for a second try on their dime. I do appreciate the effort and commitment Jeff has to his customers, so I will give them a second try and update my review."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection which is great. The service is good and the place itself has a nice decor and plenty of TVs. The food is good I usually get the Newcastle cheeseburger. The prices are a little high, but you can tell that from the outside of the building walking in. This place could very well be a high class Hooters: It has all women waitresses and they dress in little tight dresses."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was so good! Glad we decided to come and give it a try. Our server Andrew C was really nice, helpful & funny. Our food was good! Highly recommend the Caprese Salad, Pub Burger & Crème Brûlée!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with my fiance on 4/12 for drinks at around 5:30 PM and noticed upon entering that the pub was empty. We were seated by the hostess at a table where the sun blinded us, so we decided to move to a table right behind where we were placed. After about 10 minutes, we had still not been acknowledged by a server so I went back to the hostess and asked her if we could have someone take our orders. After another 5 minutes, our orders were finally taken. The food was decent but the service was absolute crap so I left her a dollar tip."}
{"text":"Ok I'll admit I have not been here often.  This was our third time trying and I still am not impressed and probably won't be back.  I think when the food is not good, I have a hard time paying what we had.    Now this is a great spot no doubt to meet for drinks.  A very lively crowd and the three times I've been here it has always been crowded.  I like the atmosphere and vibe.  Our waitress for the night was the highlight.  She was friendly and checked on us frequently.    Food- 3 stars-  We started off with the Oven Baked Soft Pretzel ($10.95) which was fantastic.  No complaints there.  For just the 2 of us it was very filling which we calculated into what we were going to order for dinner.  Being we were both half full we decided to split the Specialty Entrée the Bacon Mac ($14.50).  I'm generally not a big mac n cheese type when eating out, but after a recent Yelp event at a small but outstanding establishment that also had a bacon mac-n-cheese item on their menu I have been craving ever since.  My wife had ordered at that place as bar food and I fell in love with it.  So here I now sat waiting anxiously for this Bacon Mac-n-cheese.  And we waited, and we waited, and we waited some more.  We waited long enough that I could of easily been drunk if I had continued to order more beer.  Luckily I had my one and done and resorted to water until the food arrived.  Once it arrived it was quickly apparent it was over-cooked, burnt on the bottom and just not good.  Usually you add bacon to anything and it's great.  Not this.  At this point I'm remembering our 2 previous visits and was not impressed those times either with our meals.  I worked at some restaurants back in the day and I refuse to ever send any food back from those memories.  So I ate my portion and left very disappointed.    Waitress- 5 stars-  I will say we've had great service aside from the food the times we've been here.  Tonight was no different.  Atmosphere- 5 stars- The place has always been lively and full of families, friends, couples, co-workers, you name it.  Plenty of TV's to watch sports and not so loud you can't have decent conversations.  Price- 1 star- It's really hard to stomach paying what we did for the meal we received.  I'd probably gave this place a 4.5 star review if I only had the drinks and appetizers.    Overall I'd meet people here for drinks and such, but not coming here for the food.  I refuse to be fooled for the 4th time."}
{"text":"Horrible opening. The bar and restaurant are empty with reserved signs on half the tables and there is a line out the door. Obviously the owner/manager does not want to make money because we just spent $300 at Gordon's next store. So, then we came back. The same tables are still empty with patrons going to other bars. Duh! Newsflash! You will be equal to Famous Dave's. Boring."}
{"text":"First time I've ever had an open table reservation not honored.  I'm not sure what to think about these people.  I get there at 5:55 for a 6:00 reservation. They don't have a table.  10 minutes later I'm offered a high top.  Seriously?  Is it just me or wouldn't you hold actual tables for opentable customers?  Anyway 6:25 we have a table. Food was ok at best.  The charcuterie plate might as well have been served on an Oscar Meyer plate."}
{"text":"Waited an hour to be seated after being told 20mins  which is okay because the worlcup was on.  Finally got seated and waited 20mins with 10 different servers walking by without even an hello.  As we were walking out and the manager was like \"I can get someone for you\".  Too late at this point.  I felt like I was in Scottsdale.  Maybe having my kids with me turned them off! Happy father's day."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a little bit of everything on the menu. The wait staff is always super nice and take care of you! It's my wife and I's favorite go to restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere with music and dim lighting this is the place, plus their food is good  and everyone is friendly too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming to this place for the hours and the late happy hour! They have a great menu!  We recently dined here this past week and we had been waiting for what felt like forever and finally Alyssa W saw us and saved us from walking out. She made our dining experience amazing and accommodated all my food allergies and was truly a great server! We'll be back to sit in her section!"}
{"text":"I had a business dinner here with a lady that i met for the first time on July 7th night. I thought the people were friendly, the service was fast enough. I arrived first and they helped me to a table. I didn't really like the location of the table so I asked to be moved by the window since this business meeting was important for me. They had to check with the server to see if he would serve that table I asked for (!). I thought I did not need to know that.  Anyhow, the server, Nathan I believe, was awesome. He got busy with a large group of people later and a shift manager ( in yellow/gold shirt) I believe, came on to check on us. I thought that was nice too. We shared a calamari, she had chicken something and I had sirloin steak. We had the same white wine. The steak was a bit too seasoned but cooked right.  So the problem? Next day when I touch based with her she told me that she was sweating, she threw up and had cold shivers and felt super tired. I had similar effects but no throw up. She said she had more calamari than I did and she is a petite lady. We came to a conclusion that, having similar symptoms and have eaten together only the calamari we must have had food poisoning. I contacted a Mr Hopper ( general manger)  I believe, I got his name of online their website and was able to talk to him. He told me that he did not have any other complaints but that he would look into this and call me back. This was 2 weeks ago. I think he is dodging the problem, but I thought the public should know.  You might get good service, good food, but at the expense of your health. I would not recommend this place to my friends nor to may enemies."}
{"text":"Great service great food! I love that i can reserve a table in advance."}
{"text":"This is such a great spot, the menu has something for absolutely everyone. Had a party of ten here last night and everyone loved their dinner. I recommend the blood orange margarita and the Brussels Sprout salad!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experienced we ever had! Knowing that this place just opened some of my friends came in early to get a table, they were told that it's going to be a 40 minute wait which was no problem, so they went to walk around the mall . Came back around 4 just to find out that their names were never on the list. Long story short we never got seated until 5:30, but knowing we had little kids we got seated at the tall table where high chairs can't reach. We ordered drinks and everyone got there drink but I didn't get my water or my son water until 20 minutes after everyone got theres, after telling 2 different waitresses. A table opened up so we ask the waiter if we can take it since there's no way our little boy can eat. He said that's fine so our son finally got to sit down comfortably. We ordered our food, grilled salmon for me and fish and chips for my husband. 30 minutes we got our food, just to find out that the salmon is undercooked, when I told the waiter he said that's how the cook cooks it, ok well the menu didn't state that or was I ask if I want it to be cooked all the way and the fact that I'm pregnant, raw meat is not ok. At that time I had it and just told them to take my food and give us our check. They didn't charge us for the salmon, thank god, it wasn't even worth $20 if they did. We will never got back to this location. The staff had no clue what they were doing."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Thirsty Lion.  We were there as a large group (27) and they did a pretty good job keeping up with us.  The chicken nachos were amazing.  I had the waldorf salad which was really good but the chicken was too peppery, it overwhelmed the salad."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion is an upscale pub with a good food menu but the beer is just too expensive. I came here on a Wednesday night for Trivia and the place was packed. It took about 30 minutes to get a table for 4, so I'd recommend making reservations ahead of time.  My biggest grip with the Thirsty Lion is that they don't put prices on the beer menu, which has 52 options. Then I come to find out my normal beer was $7 a glass, which I think is way too much 4 drinks later. This place is just not cool enough to warrant regular beer costing that much. There aren't many vegetarian options on the menu, so I had one of the few, the roasted artichoke & pesto pizza. The pizza was really yummy - moist crust, lots of toppings, good cheese."}
{"text":"Just went here for my sister in-laws b-day the staff was awsome. We had a party of eight with a reservation at 7 on a busy night and we were seated almost right at seven. The Scottish eggs are great and for the main course I recommend the BBQ white cheddar burger it was amazing it has this garlic aioli  sauce that is so good. This is a great place we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"While the name and the decor might make you think this is a British-themed pub, the fare is  actually from multicultural cuisines. Yes, you can get fish and chips as well as scotch eggs (my favorite here), but you can also opt to have seared ahi tuna salad, kung pao chicken, Italian pizzas and much more. Service is efficient and the prices are moderate, considering the food leans toward high-end."}
{"text":"This place left me pleasantly surprised! I don't usually like chains, actually I make it a practice to not dine at chain restaurants! But, my sister invited me to meet here for dinner and drinks and I obliged.   We were greeted with a friendly smile. The server was cheery, prompt, and had lots to recommend on the menu. The food was good. Like really good. Again, had me surprised! We ordered the fish tacos and the Ahi salad off the gluten free menu. I figured it would be just ok, but both dishes were delicious!   I just might return one of these nights. =)"}
{"text":"Love the Thirsty Lion. It's a great place in Scottsdale for dinner. My favorite dish is the grilled Salmon which I order every time I go. They're drinks were also very good I enjoyed your old fashion it was delicious."}
{"text":"I recently had a work event here and as the organizer I was unable to attend but the event coordinator, Deanna, and staff were super helpful and replied quickly to any questions I had in the preparation of the event.  We requested space for 40+ people (numbers changing 2-3 days before event) and she handled it with aplomb. Even with changes up to the last 2 hours, she was a dream to work with.  My group came back with compliments of a delightful and fun filled evening with good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wish that I would have consulted this page before going. All waiter's attire: Button up shirt with tie and slacks All waitress's attire: Casual top with super tight and short skirts. By short I am meaning no longer than half thigh. The kids didn't care, but made me feel super awkward (especially with friends from out-of-state) Although this is not a kid friendly environment, I did appreciate that they had a kids' menu.  It seemed like the big screen TV's were mounted every 10-20 feet apart. With a party of 8, I appreciate that they didn't have to hull tables together and had a big round table for all. Scottish Eggs and BBQ pulled pork sandwich were great."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion is generally good but not the exciting food adventure I thought it would be.  Went there for a celebration lunch and was hoping for some out-of-the-ordinary celebration fare.  Started with the Scotch Eggs: OK because I never make them at home, but there was really no sausage (so it was basically breaded deep fried egg).  Then we split a (traditional) burger: it also was decent but no great shakes.  Fries were overdone.  Service was fast and friendly.  Wine was really good (according to my wife).  Overall 3 stars out of 5 but I have had much better for the money at local eateries.  Seems there is an unspoken surcharge for being located in Tempe Town Center..."}
{"text":"Long wait, ( 1/2 place was empty) took forever for drinks, messed up our appetizer and drink order, had no napkin/untensils, portion sizes too small for sharing (never usually an issue). Staff mostly teenagers. Not impressed"}
{"text":"The edamame is amazing. Fish-N-chips good and filling.  Coleslaw was mediocre. Service was excellent especially for coming in at 9 PM."}
{"text":"Came in to workers sitting around talking as restaurant was pretty empty. Got seated by someone who ended up being our server as well, no issues. Problem was with as empty as the place was, service was horrible. Waters and iced teas filled once during meal and that was at our request, getting food ordered felt like we almost had to shoot a flare up to get their attention... same scenario with getting a bill. Food was good, but they forgot to leave cheese off sliders... not a huge deal, but kind of cherry on top. What a difference a couple months is, came here in January and loved it... completely opposite experience. Too many other places like this to eat to ever come here again."}
{"text":"Great beers and the food is always good. Our bartender was dressed as a leprechaun. His name was Payton and gave excellent service. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I do not know about all these other people on here having bad service, but ours was amazing. We had just finished watching the Avengers, and we were starving. Very few places were open. We tried Cadillac Ranch, and they turned us away with bogo appetizer cards, because they had a buy out. We then went to some Mexican food place, which had Horrible service, and A horrible vibe, so we walked out. Then we came across Thirsty Lion Pub & Grill.   Mind you it was late at night. 10 pm. And even though they were going to be closing in an hour (Sunday night 11pm), they treated us with amazing service. Our waiter was so nice, chatty, but respectful to give us space. Knowledgeable about our wines and drinks. And the food was absolutely amazing. I am a HUGE customer service person, and there are many stores I refuse to shop at because the girls/boys/ cashiers were very mean and rude.   We can not wait for our family to visit, as this is a new place we would love to show them, and take them to eat. The menu is awesome, but the waiter did mention to steer clear of any of the sushi, as their cooks are trained to prepare it, but not skilled. BUT EVERYTHING else on the menu is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but i don't think I will ever return here. We had 3 different waiters and the service was really really really slow. Good thing we had time on our hands and not to mentioned they gave us dirty plates for our appetizers. Gross"}
{"text":"So, first off. If you are going to call it happy hour, don't just take 30 percent of the food off the plate and give me a 30 percent discount. that's horse shit.    $3.50 coors light  on happy hour? FU, coors light should probably not be 3.50 ever. thats a rip.    Lindsay, Lauren??? I dont know, brown haired girl behind bar. You have to be a TON hotter/friendly to give this bad of service and get away with it. I thought it was weird that my beer was empty for so long, so I went to take a piss and noticed it wasnt a special treat for me, everyone had empty beers.    While I was in the pisser I thought to myself, \"self, this looks like a pisser in a frat house\"   SO, I left."}
{"text":"I popped in here for Happy Hour with a friend and was surprised at how great their HH prices are!   We ordered their garlic edamame {$3.95} and it was ridiculously good! Beware: You will have garlic breath all evening! ;) Totally worth it though. The California Roll {$5.95} was also tasty!   The drinks were delicious as well. I had a grapefruit and basil martini {not on HH} and it was made with fresh grapefruit juice which made it a real winner. Well cocktails, select beer and wine, and a margarita are only $4! Now that is a steal for Scottsdale!   I'm sure i'll be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Go to this place for your one stop eat all. Great staff and top notch food. I like the wood fire pizza and try the vast assortment of beers on tap. Started in Oregon and now popular in Arizona, this -Concept Entertainment , owned restaurant is sure to impress for any occassion. Enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"This place is good for happy hour with a friend. Is it the best place I've  eaten at? No. Is it the best pub food? No. But they have good beer and that's all I look for when I need a good HH. The food wasn't terrible, it's decent. The prices are reasonable for HH and I've tried their sandwiches which are okay."}
{"text":"We sat for 15 minutes and were never greeted by a wait person. Walked up the hostess stand to make them aware - I was ignored. Our party of 5 left and no one even noticed."}
{"text":"We used to live in Tempe but moved shortly after the Thirsty Lion was opened. We were fortunate enough to eat there before the move, and have been back (now a 40 min drive) on special occasions.  Our latest visit was this past week, we were told, very sadly, that they removed my husband's favorite menu item from their choice of offerings - corned beef and cabbage.  But why? We weren't given an answer - and left without eating...very disappointed they changed their menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is large and really noisy even at 4:30pm on a weekday. Better than average menu of starters, burgers, salads etc.  Not impressed with the execution though. Happy hour specials ok. Skip the hummus but chicken nachos are interesting..wish they'd shred the chicken tho or cube it. Instead, there are 3-4 pieces of breaded fried boneless chicken on top of the nachos.  We also had calamari which was tender but the white breading doesn't adhere to the calamari. The best thing we had was a pear flatbread. Pretty good. We will,give them another try. Maybe we just didn't hit the right items on the menu? I want to love the food because the location is so convenient. The menu is comprehensive and it would be a real find if the kitchen could execute all menu items successfully! They push a lot of food out of the kitchen, relatively quickly...slow down and work on perfecting the recipes of menu items! We will give it one more try!"}
{"text":"Great place! First time here! Ordered the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna Appetizer (definitely recommend it). Great dinner menu - plenty of great dishes to choose from as well as a separate seasonal menu as well. Great selection of beer and wine and the service was exceptional.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a friends birthday, and probably won't be going back. They had one waitress working our table which is unheard of, since it was a table of about 15 ppl. She skipped over a couple people when it came to ordering and said \"I took orders from those who looked at me\". Really? It took about 15 to get the first drink in hand. The food came out at a reasonable pace. The second drink I ordered took about 20 min to get! It was a beer at that. I ordered, waited about 6 min, my boyfriend went out to use a cigarette (which is about another 6-8 min) and when he came back in she came around the table again and he asked her about to drink and said was like oh ill get that right now. Another 7 min passes by and she finally brings it, and my boyfriend asks to see the manager. The manager comes over and asks what the problem is, my boyfriend explains and the manger proceeds to argue with him! The manger said we have not been waiting 20 min for a drink, that he saw the ticket time and it was put in 6 min ago, then he touches the beer and said it cold, if it were poured 20 min ago it would have been warm. RUDE! Bad service all around. And didn't resolve anything besides arguing with the customer and walking away!"}
{"text":"I went there for the 2nd time last week and the food was real good.  Mostly I'm impressed with the service.  The first time we went there our waitress thanked us and shook our hand.  I appreciate when someone makes an effort that goes beyond the norm.  The second waitress was really good as well. This is a well run company.  I hope they do very well."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. A little overpriced and really just mediocre."}
{"text":"Boss and I were in town for a conference. We had our first lunch meeting held here. It's located at the massive Fashion Square Mall. The area was under construction, glad the cab driver was able to drop us off right in the front so we didn't have to haul our luggage around.   Ambiance: a typical pub but the place looked pretty chill for a early week lunch. Not much going on.   Food: Got the fish tacos that came with 3 pcs. It was very juicy and Baja flavored. The portion was just right for a light lunch.   Overall: a great place for a simple and quick nosh."}
{"text":"Still sitting here - beer is great / appetizers like the pizza (tastes like microwave version) and pretzels ( like super pretzel from Costco with a bad queso dip) however the Tuscan kale salad was extremely good - I would not come here again except for happy hour for beer"}
{"text":"First visit to the Thirsty Lion in my old stomping grounds. Beautiful addition to the Fashion Square Mall in Scottsdale.  Will do their Fish 'n Chips...they just arrived, talk to you later."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the first time we had great service, we had kids along with us and our server was more than accommodating. The second time with a few friends wasn't as great of an experience! To start, the server, Carlos, only asked my 2 friends what they wanted to drink and walked away quickly, neglecting my order. I understand people make mistakes and get busy and forgetful, we're all human. He not once asked to refill our drinks and was hardly seen. Dinner was good, one of our friends had to leave and his tab was rung up, however, Carlos disappeared nowhere to be found for at LEAST 30 minutes after so we had to find another server so we could pay our tab. We weren't rude about it, however he did only receive a 10% tip instead of 20%. We were the only table out on the patio, he seemed really stressed, rushed and impersonal."}
{"text":"Wanna go to a place that doesn't take you seriously? If youre 20 something plan on that. We sat for 30 minutes to get waited on, then add the 30 minutes we waited on to get order upon, AND the 40 minutes just to get our drinks,   I flagged down the waitress to get our check. If you go here have fun waiting."}
{"text":"Started off weird, asked waitress the beer prices.  She said go ask the bartender.  So we did.  Another employee became our new waiter after the ask.  My husband had a Blue Moon draft.  It was excellent as always.  He ordered the chicken enchilada.  He could taste sauce and cheese but not much chicken.  I had the medertarian chopped salad.  There was so little turkey in it should be call a veggie salad.   The prices are high for what you get at this place.  The owners need to pay for the mall location.  Three stars for the good beer."}
{"text":"Outstanding service outstanding food, we had the strawberry hazelnut salad, California roll and split a cheeseburger. Food rocked, I know I'm a chef.  Tara, Brian and Brian the manager are above superior in their field. Please come to San Francisco we need the thristy lion in Union square. Thank you again, Joy/Frankie"}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided we will never come back here. It was a totally unexpected experience. We came here on Saturday morning, service was slow but we understood because it's weekends. We still left 20%tips to our server, but we just saw on our card payment that he tipped himself more than30%."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion started in Oregon and we now have three locations here in the Valley. They lean towards a European - American pub type atmosphere. With more than a dozen appetizers, small plates are the largest part of Thirsty Lion's menu which contains various types of food (spicy tuna rolls, nachos, pizza, etc). The drink menu features over 50 draft beers and wines by the glass. The restaurant itself is very large with a large bar and an outdoor patio. They are pretty similar to the Yard House. I got the NW Pub Burger (a Gorgonzola infused burger with maple pepper bacon, arugula and horseradish cream) and really enjoyed the toasted bun it came on. Thirsty Lion isn't a place for you to come to have conversation. The music is pretty loud and the bar area is usually hopping (especially if there is a good game going on). They obviously hire their wait staff based on looks. Because of this, I found the customer service to be pretty mediocre which is a bummer because food here is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is average. I base my reviews on believing that 5 stars means my experience was out of this world and unique. 3 stars is average- nothing special, nothing memorable. So please consider that when reading: The menu was just like any other restaurant you might find in a mall with slightly higher than usual prices. I ordered the fish and chips which were quite greasy and I ended up not being able to finish them. My boyfriend ordered the Reuben and he said it was okay.  The cocktail list seemed exciting but I didn't try any. If I were to ever go back to this place it would probably only be for a cocktail and nothing else.. Wouldn't bother spending money on food here.  I guess I can't expect much from a mall restaurant but was hoping for more after reading the reviews here on Yelp."}
{"text":"Again thirsty lion with the disappointment you call this fried chicken!!!! Horrible even after it took our food over an hour to come out this place just needs to close down or get new management even took the servers 30 mins to bus a table come on guys!!!!"}
{"text":"As my first time I wasn't impressed. This place is more over hyped than anything. Went during happy hour and ordered the spinach dip, pretzel and cheese appetizer, sliders and fries. Nothing stood out except for the Lagunitas IPA I had."}
{"text":"Let start off by saying that the drinks was a 4 star our waitress was nice, but the waiting for a simple pizza was just a 1star. We waited 30 minutes to get our pizza....The waitress should at least and try and come to the customer and let them know that their food will take a bit longer or is almost ready but don't just pass them by without saying anything. Acknowledge the customer KEYWORD acknowledge!!!"}
{"text":"I will at some point go back here, but being new to the area and having so many new options, there was not anything over the top to warrant a 4 or 5 rating from me.   Met a buddy for drinks and some grub on a Thursday night around a month ago.  We are both fairly new to the area and picked a place we had both not been.   We sat at the bar and I had arrived first and it was not very crowded, around 8 PM. Bartenders were plentiful and attentive as soon as I sat down, very friendly. Olympics were around that time, so the multiple TVs at the bar were nice.   I guess these days when you say \"pub\", I think diverse beer selection and maybe a surprise or two in there, and while the selection is decent, it felt a little mainstream for the area and not plentiful.   One detractor was the sound level of the music. Seemed a bit loud for a Thursday night in Gilbert. It was a little difficult to hold a conversation.  As for menu, I recall a lot off \"that sounds good\" options on the menu (which is one reason I'll be back), but was craving a burger that night. Burger was prepared well and tasted really quite good and we didn't wait very long for food to arrive.   I'll be back, but I have a lot of other options to try first."}
{"text":"Nice pub, great service. Try the garlic shrimp, mussels, and sausage: them's tasty vittles."}
{"text":"Our food was great- had the strawberry basalmic salad and my hubs had the bronzed mahi mahi. Despite being a Saturday night we got our food promptly. We did sit at the outdoor bar which was less busy. The bartender was assertive which was also nice, but not overbearing. We also came a different time for drinks and an appetizer (pear and Gorgonzola flatbread) that was delicious. At that encounter our bartender wasn't miss congeniality but the food was great and we enjoyed the large tvs everywhere. We did have to flag her down a few times to place orders unfortunately which is why I ranked this a 4/5."}
{"text":"Well, we were greeted by a less than impressive non-smiling hostess and it went down hill from there.  We went in for a quick bite and drinks during happy hour.  We were seated about 15 minutes before happy hour was over and ordered three simple happy-hour appetizers within a few minutes.  We didn't get any food until more than FOURTY MINUTES LATER, and that was after asking for the manager.  The server was slow and not responsive or attentive.  The manager came to our table and agreed the wait was way too long and he would \"take care of it\" so we expected him to pay for at least the food.  We ordered one more beer from the manager that took over ten minutes to find it's way to our table.  The bill took a very long time, the plates were not cleared when empty, and the manager, though coming by neighboring tables, never returned to our table to see if things were ok.  We had to pay for the drinks and the food was free.  Oh, the food wasn't that good either.  It was uninspired and just warm.  I was NOT impressed and will go back to Gordon Biersch yards away next time.  On the positive side our margarita and seasonal spiced beer were good."}
{"text":"I had been to the Thirsty Lion for lunch before, and had more positive memory of it than this dining experience would suggest (and no, I didn't drink anything at lunch).  We started with the soft pretzel appetizer - that was pretty good.  For dinner, I ordered the Reuben - normally, when you get a Reuben, it's ridiculously overstacked with corned beef.  Not a problem at Thirsty Lion.  This Reuben looked like you made it your self - kind flat.  In a case of the senses complementing each other, the taste lived down to the visual, as the Reuben tasted pretty flat, too.  The kraut was dull, and the Russian dressing was bland.  But the fries - nope - blah.  The service was pretty good.  And, they had soccer on several of the TVs.  Soccer.  Really.  At least there was a baseball game to break up the visual monotony."}
{"text":"3 stars...are you tripping? This place is the bomb.  Howard is the bomb.  Busy...yes, caus' the food is sick.  Got a problem ? Ask for Howard. I want to live here."}
{"text":"This place has a killer happy hour, including a late night one after 9pm, which is particularly nice before going to the movies or after shopping. Also the food is pretty good here. I've had 2 of their salads and my boyfriend got a burger- cooked to perfection or all of it is quite reasonably priced. They have a nice seasonal menu, and they have a private room where they will play particularly popular football games as to not make the place too noisy for other bar patrons. I dig that! The service is always good and cocktails are decent too. Above avergae barfood and great happy hour will def have me coming back."}
{"text":"Free lunch on a rainy Monday, yes please!  Thanks to the Thirsty Lion for the invite. We shared the Scotch eggs (first time trying these) very Delish but high in calories of course! I opted for the seared ahi salad, very good amount of tuna and wasn't able to finish more than half. My date had a burger that was devoured. Perfectly cooked med rare and nice & juicy. This is a great place that offers everything! Big screen TV's for the sports fanatic too."}
{"text":"Tried Thirsty Lion for the first time with a work group. Started rather rough as we got there before the dinner rush (4:30) and asked for a table for eight of us. They said it would be a few minutes. There were six people in the whole place!  We waited 15 minutes before being seated (by the time we left at 7, it was only 1/4 full).   TL seems to be going thru an identity crisis: are they a sports bar, an Irish Pub or something else?    Beer selection was ample, along with 4 seasonal beers. Got my fave: Kilt Lifter.   Ordered several apps, with mixed reviews: the soft pretzel was good but the cheese sauce was nasty. What did they put in it?  The crab cakes were small, heavily breaded with little flavor. The calamari was liked by some and not others. I found them bland. The pub chip nachos were a big hit and we ended up with three plates of them!  Our entrees came, which were mostly burgers, since reviewers said to stick with those. One brave soul tried the Kung Pao Chicken and said it was very good with good spice level. Another got Beef Tenderloin Tips and was pleased, but not with the $17.95 price tag.   Service was adequate but for a party of eight on a slow night, I expect better than adequate."}
{"text":"Came here late at night after most places had closed and before a night out on the town.  The waiter was accommodating and friendly.  The food here is def. pub/comfort food and hit the spot!  Drinks were delicious as well. Will admit it's a little pricey for the type of food, but since there were not many options at the time, it was money well spent.  The pretzel fondue was amazing, with the right amount of tangy/zesty cheese that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"if you are thirsty do not come here. I have been waiting to be greeted since THE MANAGER sat me my table 20 minutes ago..."}
{"text":"I have been here for a couple of events and just came in yesterday with a friend to eat before a movie. We had the beer cheese soup and scotch eggs. The beer cheese soup has a smoky spice to it which was unusual but terrific. The scotch eggs were not what I expected. I do not like soft boiled eggs and in my knowledge traditional Scotch Eggs are hard boiled. They obliged me and cooked them through for me. They were served with a mild Dijon mustard that had the tiny mustard seeds in it and I liked that very much. During the summer they are running a special where you get any pizza, two soft drinks and two movie tickets for $20. That's a sweet deal!"}
{"text":"This place is just alright. The main reason I've came back a few times is because my family and friends seem to like it a lot.   The food isn't bad. I really like the Green Chili Chicken Sandwich. The prices border \"over-priced.\"  My main gripe with this place is the service. For the most part it's been good. The bartenders are always nice and helpful. The few times that I've had a waiter, I haven't received the same type of service. It's taken around 7 minutes just to get a menu. There have been numerous times where I've asked for steak sauce or other miscellaneous items and it has taken 15 minutes to get them. There was a time where I didn't receive it at all and after waiting 15 minutes after receiving my food, I just decided to go to the bar and ask them. I'd understand if the place was busy, but the times that these occurrences happened, wasn't busy at all.   So all-in-all, Thirsty Lion should be a 3rd option for going out."}
{"text":"Had a really nice experience with a group of about 10. Made reservations and everything was ready when we arrived. Our server , Colton was attentive to the entire table. Food was delicious. Beverages were great. We were seated on the patio which was great."}
{"text":"We were surprised to hear they served California Rolls.  So, we started with that and it was good.  For our mains, we ordered Fish n Chips and a French Dip. The meat on the French Dip tasted like it had expired.  Fish n Chips was a small portion atop of a stack of french fries.  This tasted like a McDonald's Fish sandwhich. The french fries looked great, but had no flavor.  Personally, I think they have WAY too much on their menu to put enough effort into a few good menu items to do well. Slow service. We never complained.  A manager came over to talk with us and thanked me for the feedback and said, \"we have something to offer to everyone, so hopefully you can find something you like next time. \"  I was not looking for any deductions on our bill, however, he should have tried to at least give us a coupon for another try.  Although, even then I would not return.  Airport food is way better!"}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patios and happy hour menu. Service was slow, but it was VERY busy, so that was understandable. My pizza was very good!  Also had a house margarita on happy hour. YUM!"}
{"text":"Ok, so changing this review as it was intended for Tempe location."}
{"text":"Two visits. First experience was great: good service good food and we got to watch the game of choice. First experience was so good we went back for lunch and to watch a baseball playoff game a few days later. The Thirsty Lion has approximately 15 TVs and at least 3 were not being watched. None of the sets was playing the game, we asked the staff if one of the sets could be switched to the baseball game. Again this is the playoffs no ordinary game but no, they would not accommodate claiming every TV was reserved for football including lots of out of town games. The manager was barely apologetic. We were  looking forward to lunch and the game: we left  without both.  I guess the sports in this so-called sports bar is nothing but football when football is on."}
{"text":"A friend and I were invited to the pre-opening where servers and chefs were practiced on a limited menu. She had fish tacos, I had the stacked enchiladas. The enchiladas were made with a BBQ/SW flavor vs regular Mexican enchiladas. That's not my preference in flavor but the quality was there. They also gave us each a cup of curry soup, which was fantastic. That trip would've been a 4.5 - 5 star experience. We were both impressed with all of it and happily anticipated the opening to come back.   Last night I came back with my husband. We ordered various appetizers to sample. First up was  a pretzel and beer cheese. The pretzel lacked flavor and was overcooked to the point of crispy. The beer cheese was slightly thicker than water and tasted like it came from a jar. Bummer!  Then our burger and BBQ pork sliders arrived. We both agreed they were forgettable. Service was okay. Food took awhile to arrive and she was not as attentive to refilling drinks as we would like. She took a long time to bring the check, but she was friendly.   Someone, who we assumed was a shift manager, came by to ask how it was. We said it was fine. She asked for more info, thanked us for the feedback and offered us a couple of appetizer coupons to return again, which was nice.   To sum it up - we might try it again since we have the coupons but the food quality and flavor wouldn't bring us back without them. Maybe I need to stick with the curry soup?  Side note: this place is LOUD! We could barely hear each other and we were in the \"quieter\" spot to sit in."}
{"text":"Everyone here is great. Food. The house margarita and the people. The manager, the servers, etc. it's so hard not to come back here once in a while."}
{"text":"I was pretty pumped to try out the Thirsty Lion thinking it was going to be more of a brewery than a restaurant. But turns out its more of a restaurant than a brewery as most the brews on tap are found pretty much anywhere. Besides that the service was pretty disappointing here. No silverware was given to us after asking for it multiple times, our waitress took almost about 30 minutes to greet us and the food was pretty mediocre. Overall not a very good experience."}
{"text":"Great for happy hour and tons of seating.  Groups or small numbers, all of it works.   Def come during happy hour till six and be merry cause life's too short for anything else!"}
{"text":"So we went on a Saturday night and they said it was a 40 minute wait, so we left our number...grabbed a drink at a bar and 20 minutes later we got a text...they held our spot for us...Score a point for the Lion.  Food, well I have had better Scotch Eggs, but this was a valiant effort. The bacon wrapped dates...AMAZING. The stacked smoked chicken dinner, very very good!!   Drinks. If it's 105 outside it's half off Moscow Mules....I don't think they actually check the temp, so that is a plus...Score more points for the Lion.  Overall, it is a pretty decent place and the food is good. Nothing bad to say about it. It is large, and it is kind of a Chain feel, but the food and the drinks definitely makeup for that aspect.  Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"When invited by my daughter to dinner my first thought was that this was just an expensive bar in an upscale mall. I was really off on that one.  The establishment is very inviting and the food was excellent. Prices were well within the affordable level and the service was what I would expect for a typical restaurant. I had the scallops over a kale bedding. They were extremely tender and perfectly done. Also, had a taste of the sautéed Brussels sprouts, oriental chicken and the fish and chips. All were very well done and each would be a perfect choice for my next visit. There is ample parking and the site has an outdoor seating area with heaters and a large fire pit for waiting or just a drink. Nice facility and great staff."}
{"text":"Best dining experience ever!!!!! Holly was our server and was absolutely amazing! Her customer service was spectacular and she made us so happy! The food was just as good as the service!!!!!"}
{"text":"There nachos's are off the hook here.  I have been to this establishment many times and have had excellent service everytime.  I keep going back for their food and service.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before, but now I'll be going back again and again. The atmosphere was appealing, the service impeccable, and the food amazing! Everything looked and tasted fresh, was served at the right temperature, and had inventive combinations of foods and seasonings. We had a Moscow Mule to drink, a Caesar salad, the spicy mac & cheese, and the fish and chips. I can't take anything too spicy, so I asked for the chipotle aioli on the side for the spicy mac & cheese. I stirred just a tiny bit of it into the entire dish and it was plenty spicy for me! Our server, Lindsey, stopped by our table several times to talk with us, and I was as amazed by her ability to hold plates in her arms for a long time as I was at her friendliness and knowledgeableness about the company."}
{"text":"It would be remiss of me not to mention how distasteful my Peppered Bacon Cheeseburger was the last time I ate here. Salt and pepper is beef's best friend. The overly soggy fries didn't bode well either.  Don't worry TL, I still love you and all of your endearing qualities. However, in conformity with full disclosure, I have to dock you 1 star, because honestly, now I'm apprehensive to come here solely for the food."}
{"text":"Great environment and even better service. Fern is a rockstar!  The management has always been on point as well. Just a great place all around."}
{"text":"Appetizers are amazing try the calamari and Italian meat plate. Great drinks. Amazing service!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Thirty Lion, primarily because the service and the food can be a hit or miss.   Mind you, I've given them Four Stars, so they cannot be all that bad. And, they're not.   I believe it's when they get slammed, they forget about you. And when they're not, well... the staff slows down to catch their breath. It's really both the front of the house and in the kitchen.   A good example is our most recent visit last night. Our server Tim was first rate and we experienced no problems. In fact, Tim as great. Now I order the French Dip as I have recently, but last night they...  well served some well done and hard to digest meat (photo). I've also posted another French Dip photo from 6 months ago.   We like the Thirsty Lion and yes, we are Four Star \"Fan\". We just hope for some uniformity, or a good Culinary Manager to watch over the process better.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent venue for sports and above average bar food. Will be returning."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Thirsty Lion several times. I think their burgers are very good. But this trip I had the most amazing salad ever: Roasted Beet, Arugula & Grilled Chicken Salad with roasted red and yellow beets, baby greens, arugula, grain mustard & lemon vinaigrette, chévre cheese, candied hazelnuts and grilled chicken. I substituted balsamic vinaigrette because I'm not a big mustard fan. The salad was truly amazing and I can't say enough about how delicious it was. It had me talking about it to my friends for sure. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The only think I might do is have feta in place of the chévre cheese because I felt that it would extract more flavor but it's such a small thing it barely warrants mentioning. The service is always outstanding here too. I can't wait to go back now and have the same wonderful meal."}
{"text":"This place was a nice find after our roadtrip to AZ. They have outside seating with table top fires if you don't want to eat inside. We arrived at 10pm and they were still serving a full menu with reverse happy hour on select appetizers and drinks. Also, they have a nice selection of craft brews. Orange Blossom from Papago Brewing Company was so good. It's not a winter beer at all, but doesn't really matter because it doesn't feel like Christmas in AZ either. It made me want to go to the brewery's headquarters in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Brand new and just opened up about a week ago this huge restaurant has a very organized and large menu.  They have listed appetizers, soups and salads, pizza, burgers, sandwiches and specialties.  I got here at 4:15 and the restaurant which looked empty filled up in about 15 minutes. I did find a table in the back where four of my friends are going to meet me for dinner.  The wait staff so far has been very polite and fast with drinks. When everyone arrived there were 8 of us so the staff moved us to a high top table without any problems.  The food was very good, and the portions were big. Everyone I was with thought the food was really good. It was very noisy here but it is a pub not church.  I thought for only being open for a few days that they did a really good job.  I did read some of the other reviews and could not believe how unforgiving some people are.  Hey world this place is brand new.  The staff is mostly new.  Give them a break.  Would I go back here again?  Of course, next time I am going to try the salad with goat cheese."}
{"text":"Really cool for a bar at the mall.  They have a great selection of beers but I was most impressed with the food menu which had some unique items.  I had a summer special pork carnitas salad that was outstanding.  I dug the music videos going constantly.  Some gorgeous girls working here too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  Food hit the spot for price, value, taste, price and then some.  Drinks were on par to amazing with our bartender Amy simply on spot.  She took care of our drinks with a personal touch.  GREAT OLD FASHION.  Jalapeño burger was full of flavor at medium rare, I'll be back for you soon."}
{"text":"Epic food and epic service. Our bartender was Ali and she was so friendly and suggested just the rite items to order. The cheeseburger was one of the most flavorful burgers I have ever had. The shrimp tacos were dead on point too. Best shrimp tacos I've ever had. The blue van beer was fruity pepples so that was amazing too! I can't wait to come here!"}
{"text":"Just left there and ordered a beer and an appetizer flatbread . Waited 40 minutes for them to tell me that the printer did not print my ticket so my food was put in. As a person that works in the EMS field, if I delay service that long, people die. The best they could've done is alerted me and told me. It was not busy enough for them not know of printer failure  So I had to spend more time somewhere else getting food"}
{"text":"Really great food (specifically the salmon and mango quinoa special) and surprisingly good service. Definitely recommend Thirsty Lion for anyone looking to try a new eatery and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"This was the second time that my husband & I visited this location.  We both LOVED the drinks and food! During our first visit my husband had the Caprese Chicken Sandwich and I had the Ultimate Chicken Nachos.  Both were large portions and very yummy!  This time around we decided try to new items and got the Baja Tacos and the Italian Grinder.  We were not disappointed!    The service is also great and there are plenty of TV's to see from really any seat in the place.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I can't wait to go back. This place was super busy, kind of loud (but it is a bar), but the staff was on top of everything.  We had our orders taken pretty fast and the food came out quickly and cooked to order.  I tried the Romano Chicken and it was so lovely. I want to go back and get it again."}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion is my favorite restaurant in Tempe :) I love their Pizza and Movie deal on Mondays. The pizza is always perfectly crispy and melts in your mouth. The hosts and servers always greet you with a smile and I like the two happy hour options. My favorite drink is the tropical margarita but I also enjoy the beer samplers. Good atmosphere for a date night or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Ate here randomly with my family, were extremely surprised at the amazing food. Our server was very nice and attentive, she checked on us several times and was very helpful. We ordered the artichoke spinach dip and it was hands down the best we have ever had. I had the quinoa & black bean burger and it was phenomenal. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"If you try anything here, you have to order their pretzel!  It is pretty amazing!  If only they offer more cheese and less mustard!! The restaurant is a little loud and the waitress seem a bit busy to check on our needs."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant since November and have been nothing but pleased with the food and service.  We love their Winter Menu.  The Ramen dish was amazing and just what I needed after getting over the flu!!!  The Korean Pork dish was equally amazing and my husband loves the Curry soup.  I love that there is a variety of dishes to choose from, not just the norm.  Happy Hour is great also.  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just love this place.  We have been here quite a few times since November and just love their Winter menu (and the regular menu!!)  Love the food!  The staff here has been phenomenal each time we have stopped in.  The GM, Jeff, is awesome.  He is always on top of things as well as building relationships with his customers.  We will be back, sometimes more than we should be! :)"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is decent at this bar in Scottsdale. If you need a quick bit for lunch between shopping or even a full meal before a movie, the location of the Thirsty Lion is perfect. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were shopping in the mall last night and decided to stop in for a drink before heading home.  This place was packed and we were fortunate to grab two seats at the bar.  I ordered a pear martini and the hubby had a greyhound.  We both loved our beverages - expertly mixed and so ridiculously good.  The service was a little slow, but it was certainly worth the wait for these amazing drinks."}
{"text":"Great place for good food and good beer. It is mine and my fiancée's preferred spot if we're hungry while at the fashion square. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Well well...I figured I'd wait for the extra points from Open table and although it was an awesome evening, let's talk about the support staff.  So the front line guy is the waiter, he is often supported by the busser.  These folks got it done on Friday.  The guys supporting them, the ones who get paid the most up-front: the cooks, failed the front line guys.  I don't know what happened, but for being only a half-full night the kitchen moved at an impeccably slow rate.  Put our orders in, and then we wait, and waited, and waited, getting a water refill periodically, being asked for drinks, getting an update on our food.  Our waiter finally brought our appetizer, the bacon wrapped prawns, hot to taste so I knew the food wasn't just resting on the shelf.  I split the herb encrusted mahi and jasmine rice...it was delicious and even hotter when it came.  Service was solid, back end staff needs a bit of work to keep the guys on the front line ability of customer retention."}
{"text":"OMG I am loving this place. I'm starting with the food first because it was so fabulous it deserves to be the center of my review. Let's begin with the beer cheese soup. This soup will make you forget all the other soups you have experienced in your life. It is absolutely phenomenal. Thick and rich cheddar based soup with a beautiful compliment of rich aromatic beer in every mouthwatering bite. After having a big delightful bowl of their soup I chose to go a tad bit lighter for my entree. So I had their Smoked Chicken Waldorf Salad. And once again I was blown away! And by just a salad!!! They combine Field greens with juicy pieces of smoked chicken, cranberries, green apples, feta cheese and candied pecans to create a salad to knock your socks off. This place became one of my favorite spots in town with just a soup and salad. Mind blowing!!! I have returned many times now and have experienced culinary bliss time and time again. From their fish and chips to their sinful bacon wrapped dates you have a cornucopia of choices that will not let you down. Try this place RIGHT NOW you will love it. One more thing, I would be remiss not to mention the great staff at the Thirsty Lion. They deserve a whoop whoop too!!! This restaurant has it all!!!!"}
{"text":"Really not impressed on several levels:   First of all, if one is expecting the same beer selection (as I was) as the Tempe location, forget it. In fact, their selection is hugely unimpressive.   The food likewise is a fail. The fries were hard, their classic club sandwich was unremarkable (bread hard), the spinach dip serving size too small, my child's burger too dry, but, the garlic edamame was good. All the above we've had at the Tempe location and they tasted outstanding. Not here.   I've personally participated in several food & beverage roll-outs. If I'm correct, this location opened later than its earlier scheduled grand opening. After such a delay, one expects the location to be ready when opened.  Not the case here. Just 3 days after their opening, we entered about 3:30pm and while 3/5 of the seating was open and despite the obviously large wait staff we waited -- really bad optics.  Once seated, service was ridiculously slow (to be fair, this is a notorious issue at the Tempe location).   Anyway, my much anticipated LOCAL, 'new watering hole' totally went down in flames.  So here's the gist, if you want slow service, boring beer, unremarkable bar food, all at completely uncompetitive Happy Hour features/prices, then here's a goto..."}
{"text":"Drinks are good, food is okay, but the service is the reason that keeps me from coming back more often. The servers seem way less experienced compared to the other restaurants around (and there are plenty more to choose from.)"}
{"text":"I've been here before & always enjoyed. This time I got a coupon in mail for my birthday, free entree. We had an amazing meal, service was great thanks to Shannon! And to top it off the manager brought us a free desert with a birthday card signed by staff. As someone who appreciates customer service- 5 stars!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pub food. We had the ribs and salmon/asparagus risotto- both very tasty. The fries were just so-so but this can be overlooked with how tasty everything else is."}
{"text":"We originally went to the Thirsty Lion at a pre-opening invitation only experience.   We quite liked the food, although the service was spotty.   We figured that it was just pre-opening growing pains.  After the restaurant opened we returned to try again.   First of all they were sold out of some of the appetizers. The service was absolutely terrible.    Drinks were not refilled until we managed to find someone to flag down.   The food took a long time to arrive.   The wait staff was completely inattentive.   The host staff bugged us twice to take chairs from our table.    The food when it arrived was good.  However the bad experience with service will make us hesitant to return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and visit quite often.  I love that the place is so big that you can come here even during the busiest of times and normally don't even have to wait that long if at all.    The place has a great vibe to it and is always busy with plenty of people.  The bar is the center focus with a ton of large tv's and good music playing.   The patio is also a fantastic place to hang out with some friends when it's nice out.  The misters in the summer help a lot but it's Arizona so it will still be hotter than the devils balls outside in the summer, misters or not.    On to the food!  I have been able to try a few dishes from here as it's one of our favorite lunch spots for work.  This place knows how to cook a burger lets get that straight.  Every time I get one medium rare it comes out cooked to perfection.  The white cheddar bbq burger, and the Gastropub burger are beyond good.  Their Nashville hot chicken sandwich is another gem on this menu.  I had ordered it once at lunch and the chicken had a weird rubber consistency to it.  I informed the server and within 5 minutes had a manager deliver it to the table cooked perfectly and he comped it from my check.    I can honesty say that I've never had a bad experience here and you can tell they are run by excellent management.  If you ever find yourself by Tempe marketplace do yourself a favor and go here stat."}
{"text":"We ordered French dip and it was the best I ever ate.  The steak salad is another one that was really good.  Great casual atmosphere.  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Great pub in the Tempe Marketplace!  Good selection of beer and extensive happy hour menu.  Great place to catch a quick drink on your way to the next place or before doing some shopping."}
{"text":"I feel awful leaving a poor review but this was our second bad experience here with similar service issues. At this visit, one of our meals came out 5-10 minutes after the rest of our dishes. Our drinks were not refilled and were completely empty when we got our check. We had to wait 15 minutes for the bill after our meals were done, and had to hunt server Erika down with our credit card so we could leave with our young children. I wouldn't have left a yelp review if the comment card weren't already filled out when the bill was delivered. Of course all boxes were checked for \"great\". I recommend management looks at the servers workload, seems that they may be overwhelmed with tables at dinner time."}
{"text":"Been here more than once. the first few times were hit or miss.  Service is hit or miss but this time we really had a server who was not that attentive.  He gave us good recommendations but the food was disappointing.  My friend has the ahi salad, too much horseradish that didn't seem to taste right.  We had a grilled veggie Panini, too much money for was in it.  We couldn't even taste the cheese.  So, am not sure.  Bad service, bad food.  Maybe it was not our day to be in Thirsty Lion..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for a ladies day out! I came with some gal pals and had an amazing time! Our food was WONDERFUL! And the drinks were superb! We were treated with friendliness and kindness and we're served promptly and courteous. The portions are more than generous and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for late night drinks. They have a good beer and liquor selection so definitely try and do a flight of beer,  their late-night menu is pretty limited so I'll be back to try more of the real menu later. A friend of mine got the macaroni and cheese and said it was pretty tasty overall."}
{"text":"Came here while out of town one night for dinner with friends and was pleasantly surprised. It was a Saturday night and our party was ten-plus people but we were seated quickly. Food is on the better side in the gastro pub arena with a lot of choices, and appetizers have a nice variety of options and were also tasty. Better yet in the pub realm: plenty of beer options, fast service and very pleasant staff hostess, bartender and waittress. All in all, a solid recommendation."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour on a Saturday afternoon. We split (4) appetizers and they were terrific!!! Pulled pork sliders.....yum! Calamari rings.... good as well, I personally like tentacles!! California roll.....very good  Artichoke spinach dip.....very good Our server, Ella, AWESOME!!!! Everything we needed and more!!!! Oh, hot chocolate & peppermint schnapps seasonal drink......wooohooo!"}
{"text":"Last night went for a birthday dinner for the first time, place is awesome, great selection of beers on tap, I had the shrimp tacos for dinner and it was delicious! Definitely nice atmosphere as well great customer service as we'll!"}
{"text":"A great place to go for any occasion; Lunch, Dinner, Happy Hour, Late Night.  Lots of good food and beverage options available."}
{"text":"Nice dinning experience overall Had the SW BBQ burger, ordered medium well & was cooked just right, very flavorful. My friend had the NW pub Burger also cooked to order. First time here, will definitely return."}
{"text":"***DEFINITELY RECOMMEND***  Family came in to celebrate my son's straight A report card. We ordered Brussels sprouts, lamb burger, orange chicken, and Shepard's Pie. All were great!  The service was exceptional as well. Our waitress was kind enough to have the entire wait staff sign a congratulations card for my son and provided us a free ice cream sunday.   Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and there is a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table.   Cuurently as we wait there EXACTLY 20 empty tables"}
{"text":"I was extremely dissatisfied with our waitress service, for the 7minutes I was seated. She never came to our table to get drinks started, nothing. I was excited to watch football and get Bloody Mary but that didn't happen. I will not being coming to this location ever again because that's the second time it happened. I refuse to deal with it and put up with it. I'll keep going to Scottsdale location. At least, they work while workers they carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"My aunt and I love coming here. Today when we were waiting to be seated the manger greeted us which was nice. We both wanted a booth. He had to bus the table and as he was looking for the rag. He couldn't find it and went ahead and he bused it. The hostess/bus guy opened the drawer in front of entrance where they keep coasters and crayons that's where the rag was. I used to worked in high end restaurant and small owned restaurants as a hostess/bus girl and that's not where you keep a rag when you clean tables all the time. Just a friendly reminder food is good but this place needs to get staff better doing stuff. And they still don't have pink sugar/sweet n low. Every time I come here I write a review lol."}
{"text":"Never been to Thirsty Lion before tonight, but a friend liked an entree so we went and had dinner. Our server was great and went out of his way to make sure we had boxes at the end and then made sure we ordered food before the \"kitchen closed at 10\". Usually, when a kitchen closes at 10 you can assume that the place stays open another hour after that. We put our food in at 9:55 thinking we had an hour to eat and finish our glasses of wine. But a female (small, blonde) came over and picked up the checks, right before 11, for her co-worker and told us that \"they had been closed for an hour and they wanted to leave so we should finish up and get out of here\"... VERY rudely. I am a server at two high service standards restaurants and know how to treat a guest. I am astonished at the way she spoke to us. NO ONE said they closed at 10. Our server said last call for food was at 10! So this makes no sense. And I get it, you want to leave... but say hey by the way we are closed now so take your time to finish your wine. We couldn't even finish and had to run out cause we were so uncomfortable. Never been treated so horrible by server. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Came here and like many people have said there were a bunch of open tables but they told Us an hour wait. We ended up waiting for about 45 mins. The food was good not great but good. Decent selection of beers hopefully they rotate them at times. One thing that they need to do is put shades on the Windows. The sun was beaming in my eyes and the waitress pretty much said tough luck."}
{"text":"service is hit or miss but overall good bar, I went for world series game and they would not put the sound on.  They are not a true \"sports bar\" but the food and beer are good."}
{"text":"Went last night to meet up with some friends. First time in and we were definitely impressed!  Great selections for food and beverages. Staff was attentive and prompt on a busy Saturday night which is a plus. Had the chicken nachos and they were full of flavor and did not disappoint. We will go back when in the San Tan area."}
{"text":"All the appetizers are amazing! It's not too busy here, but we came with a large group. The raspberry drop cocktail is delicious. The pretzel and edamame are great choices. The sushi is making a way to my plate now...gotta go!"}
{"text":"I've been here thee times now and have had a poor experience each time. The food is hit or miss, some things are great, but the service is continuously bad. This last time we came with a big group which we anticipated slower service but this was flat out bad. We made a reservation and got to the restaurant and wait 15 minutes to have them put the tables together, we sat at the table another 10 minutes before being spoken to, and waited for the server another 20 minutes to put in an order!! Multiple drinks were forgotten so we sat without anything to drink. We asked three times to have our checks printed out beforehand because we were on a lunch break. Checks didn't come out until we're were basically done. Haven't had a good experience here so I likely will not be back."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here while playing hooky from work one day (me that is, not him).  The inside is huge and really neatly and cleanly decorated!  There is so much space that a portion it could easily be used for a private function or private party.  We had lunch here and was surprised at the small crowd but by the time we left there was a pretty good crowd of people inside.  I had a burger and a side salad and it was really made well.  My bf had a chicken sandwich and fries and he seemed to enjoy it as well.  A pro is that they had malt vinegar, which goes well with fries.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive as well.  She kept us well hydrated on iced tea and diet coke.  There were TV's all over the place and the bar looked like it had several good beers on tap.  This is a place I want to return because of the good food, nice service and cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place for the delicious food and great service.  The have a very good happy hour that is available 7 days a week and food specials really are a great value.  The house margarita is fantastic.    I like the set up with a room in front that they use for private parties - for example if you like Oregon football they have the room booked Alumni and other fans!    Been there twice in the last few weeks and will be back. Food choices are extensive with Brussels sprouts to California rolls to burgers and such."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch on the patio. Great burgers, sandwiches and salads. Nice selection of beers. But the best was the edamame appetizer, and friendly wait staff as well!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always mainly get the fish and chips which is just simply amazing. Also get the sushi app, which my wife loves the best.  I will always keep going back."}
{"text":"I incorrectly posted a review to this business. The manager is on top of how this restaurant operates. I have not visited this location but I'm impressed at the timely response I received. I apologize for selecting the incorrect location. Best regards."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. We were warmly greeted by the staff upon entering. We went to the bar to have a beverage and were helped by a man who seemed depressed and apathetic. He took our order and never returned.  Another, pleasant, man brought us or food. All very good. I was dipping a fry in the ranch when I thought I had seen a hair. Hairs fall out.  Not a big deal. I attempted to dig it out and I got a hold of it. I pulled out out and it was attached to a clump. I placed it on the plate and it turned out it was an ENTIRE CRICKET, ROACH, WHO KNOWS WHAT. We brought it to the attention of the staff, luckily, my boyfriend was very calm and polite as I was completely disgusted at that point. I was ready to vomit. They brought us out new food. The thing that got us the most was the lack of a gushing apology. The woman who took the food away had a manager bring us the new food and nothing was said. Sure, they gave us or food free of charge. Thank you.  But, where was the aspect of customer service? What if I had made a scene? Would it have been different then? What if that bug would've ended up in my mouth? I just think they should've definitely handled the situation differently and certainly on a better level of professionalism. Ultimately, eat at your own risk. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The only reason this place received one star was because the manager comped our bill after a cockroach crawled onto my seat and then onto me.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Huge \"pub\" located in Scottsdale Fashion Square. More of a full-service restaurant with a desire to be a pub. Lots of dark wood and low lighting, but it's really difficult to feel like you're in a pub when you see shoppers in mall with their Barney's & Neiman Marcus bags!!  Lots of TVs, so you can imbibe while watching your favorite sports contest.  The fish tacos were very, very good. They came with a side of black beans, and what a tasty side they turned out to be! I don't think I've ever sung the praises of black beans, but these were out of this world! Turn s out the include some their IPA in the recipe which added a ton of flavor. The appetizer pork sliders were fine - nothing to write home about. The starter comes with two sliders, which was just right for a small tide-me-over-to dinner nosh. As for drinks, we just had Guinness and red wine - how can you miss with that?  IMHO, Thirsty Lion is o.k. Would I go back? Probably - but only if I was at the mall anyway; don't think I'd make a special trip to dine/drink there. The mall is a huge tourist draw, and my guess is they cater to them. I doubt there are a lot of locals that are regulars."}
{"text":"I disagree with most of the negative comments. 9:30pm on a Saturday night for us. Yes, it was packed, but we got seated right away at a high top table. The staff was nothing but pleasant, the food was great and the cocktail menu is outstanding.  For people to give such negative reviews the first couple weeks is stupid. It's a new place and there needs to be a huge learning curve for the staff. Lighten up Francis. Like Todd's review.....\"I'm giving it one star because the manager was not present.\" Give me a break, that big of a restaurant, with that big of a staff that holds THAT many people. I'm sure the manager of that place has 49 things to worry about before he talks to your pouty ass trying to get a table and your 3 kids their chicken strips.  It's a new place inside an already busy outside mall thats already busy from the other restaurants in the area........what do you expect at happy hour?? People that leave these reviews have never worked in the service industry.  Sorry for the rant."}
{"text":"This place will be as good as your server.  The chain is growing and they run on margins and SERVICE, so the on intangible on my first visit was great. My Bartender wrote her name on a card and introduced herself though I cant remember her name, service was spot on, kind and friendly. We chatted a bit and she took my cues that my phone and Sport Center was more important, none the less way better then most bartenders in this town. Way better. I had the Happy hour Pepperoni pizza and a pint of San Tan Devils Ale, a big glass a water came unsolicited with a big welcome smile.  All's good at the valleys newest TL and in a few months I will wait for a table or barstool without thinking why, cause I know why.  Why am I telling you this?!?! good luck TL FS"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and had to wait 20 minutes. Which is to be expected. During the wait, grabbed a seat at the bar and chilled. It was nice. It's more of a sports bar feel there. Tvs everywhere with games on. I can't complain about that. Food was good, beer was good."}
{"text":"After our second time eating here, I was inspired to write a review. Both times my husband and I have been greeted by friendly hosts, given fast and attentive service, and had delicious food. Our waitress this last time was so friendly, very helpful with the menu, and thorough in checking back, etc. We got the edamame appetizer and it was simply divine. Add all this to the atmosphere, lively music, and overall ambience... and I would say hands down this is the best restaurant in the Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hit when you are in the Tempe Marketplace. They have a huge selection of beers on tap and there is something for everyone. This past visit, we just had drinks and the bartender was super nice and attentive. Previous visits we have eaten there and they have pretty good food. They also have a great happy hour. I would definitely recommend this place for drinks or meals."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was not impressed at all. There were very few vegetarian options and no vegan options. The food that we did order was not anything to write home about."}
{"text":"I liked this place, had a big menu and i can appreciate that for the type of place that it is. Staff treated me very well and I enjoyed my time there. The food was good ( I had a burger ) and came out promptly and hot. Give anything on the menu a try you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Most of the food I've tried here is good, but there are a few menu items that seem to be microwave reheats (enchiladas for instance). Beer selection is quite good. Prices are on the higher side, which is to be expected in an establishment like this. Service is adequate, but can be slow even when the restaurant is relatively empty."}
{"text":"UPDATE: After yelping, I went inside, looking for someone to ask how much longer it would be for our food & beer, because our sever was running like a chicken with her head cut off. Our server, AJ, came up to me and said it would be just a minute longer.  After that..the manager, Jeff, came to our table and was EXTREMELY apologetic. He showed us that he cared, by getting the food and drinks out to us right away, and repeatedly came back to check on us. Let me tell you, I am not a nice hangry person, and he handled everything so well. Our spinach dip and green chili sandwich were both EXCEPTIONAL. He even proceeded to take care of our food bill!   Service wise, maybe our server was just having an off day, but mix that with a personality of a rock, and you've got a disaster. I would not hire the server at my establishment in my wildest dreams, but Jeff is seriously the reason we didn't leave cash for our beer and walk out, as I can't say enough good things about his personality/professionalism...especially with how hangry we were! ------------------------------------ Currently sitting on the patio for lunch. Beer took 17 minutes. We've been here over 30 minutes, and still no food. What the hell's going on?"}
{"text":"We love to walk around TMP.   I guess it's been here for several months since we've never seen this place before.  It wasn't very busy around lunchtime on a Sunday.  We're feeling carnivorous, good thing they have quite a burger selection.  I ordered the Tavern Burger, since both my nieces ordered my first pick, the NW Burger.  My hubby decided on the Jalapeno Pepperjack.  My sis, fighting a cold, wanted the Baja Fish Tacos.  Why?  Maybe the heat from the salsa opened up her sinuses.  My bro-in-law settled on the Pepperbacon Burger.    My cutie pie, ordered the Beer Battered Fish and Chips he gave a thumbs up to.  Everything was pretty good!  Mine came out perfectly medium well.  Why do they stab the burger with a steak knife?  I was almost afraid it will pounce on me when I take it out!   Oh, well...even my nieces gave me the \"sped\" look with that joke.  The service was good.   If you're with good company, you make the atmosphere.    We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We did our High School reunion here last Saturday, (Sept 16) and their events staff, manager, and event coordinator were excellent.  Deanna was there onsite on the day of the event and made sure all our requests were made.  Sean (the manager) accommodated us in making sure we had all the items we needed even making sure we had the right 90's music pumping in the sound system. All the wait staff called us by name and made sure our guests were accommodated. Throughout the event, nothing but good vibes and things were said about our location (private bar and patio) and raving reviews of the food we chose. We originally booked in Tempe location but with the help of Deanna were able to get us in Scottsdale with the right vibe for our event and still be within our budget.  Nothing but good things were said about this event and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Thirsty Lion again for their scratch kitchen and event staff in making our 20 year High School reunion a success!"}
{"text":"The ambience of the place was better nice, it was lively busy a great place for happy hour. The service was average, however the general manager of the store came to check on us a few times to make sure everything was good. The food was good, I ordered the jalapeño queso dip, wish it was a little spicier(I like my food spicy) as well as the jalapeño chicken sandwich, the chicken sandwich was basically just fried chicken with coleslaw, it was good but what I was expecting. Would definitely come here again for happy hour!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Wednesday night, the wait was about 10-15 minutes. The place was busy and loud but that is how the place is. It is not your hoity toity fine dining type of place. The music was good, the conversation loud, the food even better. The pizza is stone oven baked, I know this because we could watch it being made.  But we didn't order the pizza :) I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was so fresh. I don't think I ever had it made more fresh than here. My wife had the steak which so tender. Our server, Derrick, was on his game. He was spot on with our refills and was quick returning with the check.   Pros: great food, lots of atmosphere Cons: the wait to seat might be long, might be too loud for some."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. Quick, fast, friendly, efficient service. Highly recommend if in the area. Plenty of parking. Free trolley. Drink beer."}
{"text":"Having lived in Portland, OR the last 5 years - I've become somewhat of a food-snob and sometime critic. I loved living in a town that is known for it's fantastic dining - unique food trucks - and utter lack of national chain restaurants.  Moving to Phoenix was a good thing - I love the cactus, the sun, and swimming pools.  But I also love exploring new locations to dine.  I enjoy exciting menu options - new things I've never tried, old familiar things that are re-created, and old familiar things done just the right way that you expect.  How excited I was to receive an invitation for a complimentary lunch at the new Scottsdale location of the Thirsty Lion Gastropub and Grill!  I have to admit - I was a bit pensive thinking of how my previous experiences would translate to this new location.   Walking in the front door - all concerns disappeared.  Staff at the front of the house were efficient and friendly.  Just what you expect.  We were given a choice of seating locations and selected one by the window.  They even have some outdoor seating that would be fabulous in this wonderful spring we're enjoying.  Our Server - I believe it was Matt C - showed right up as soon as we sat down and took our drink order.  Matt was just like the others we had met - helpful, easy to chat with, efficient, and present when he needed to be without being a \"helicopter server\".  We reviewed various appetizer options - I was impressed with the list.  We quickly settled on the tempura beans.  While we waited for them - we reviewed the menu.  I noted that I was pleased with the number of menu options that I had to choose from - not too many, not too few... just right.  And very enticing.  I love it when I have a hard time choosing between several options - rather than trying to zero in on the least offensive one!  The appetizer came out suprisingly quick - hot, tasty, and an appropriate amount for two people with an appetite.  I would have preferred they had a little less batter - but not so much i hesitated to eat them. They were awesome!  The dipping sauce served with them was very very very good.  We next narrowed down our main courses.  Dining companion went for the fish and chips - I struggled between the enchilada stack - it sounds awesome - and the Reuben.  Matt said both were solid - but he LOVED their ruben.  Ahh - it's March.  St Paddy's is coming up ... and since I had had a nice big meal last night - I hoped that the sandwich would serve a purpose - to fulfill it's role as a delicacy that \"a king uses to purge himself of the \"demon of gluttony\". \"  Sorry ... this sandwich was so good - I believe their Corned Beef did the opposite to me.  I asked for a side of grain mustard - I don't know if it's home made or not - Matt told us that they use fresh product everywhere on the menu.  It shows.  The bread was the freshest rye I've ever had.  Every ingredient seemed as if they had labored for days to find the right product or recipe to complete my dish.  Loved the fries - but I just can't get over how much I loved my sandwich.   My dining companion had the fish and chips.  I tasted a bite with the tarter sauce and loved it.  Very solid.  He substituted the fries (which I LOVED with my Reuben) for a salad.  Blasphemy! lol... his salad was fresh and the dressing again - tasted homemade.  If it's not - they've found a great purveyor!   He filled up quickly - so I was able to taste his cole slaw.  OMG - seriously the best coleslaw I've ever had.  Too often it's over dressed, over sweet, watery, bland.  This was perfect.  I could go back just to have a side of slaw!  (Next time - regardless of what I order - I may just get a side of slaw!)  Desert was good.  He had the creme brûlée - very good.  I ordered the blackberry cobbler with an orange scented crust and vanilla bean ice cream.  Very very good - only criticism was that there was a little \"too much\" blackberry... but hey - i'd complain VERY loudly if there was't enough.   Service was solid - Matt was perfect.  Kitchen sent out the food very fast, well prepared, hot, and spot on.  Manager circulated through to check on all patrons.  Smart.  How else are you going to know how things are going.  I'm surprised more managers don't show up table side!  The location is fantastic.  Decor makes you feel like you're in a pub as expected.  Several tables filled - one with a very large group that seemed to enjoy just as quick service as we did at our table of two.  Bathrooms were easy to access and spotless.    Bottomline - Home Run! (Oh wait - that's what I need to do next - spring training games and then back to the Thirsty Lion for more fantastic dining.)    Thanks for the invitation Thirsty Lion.  It's gutsy thing to open yourself up to folks who like to critisize restaurants online.  You've got it figured out.  Bravo!  And thanks for bringing a bit of Portland to the Sonoran Desert!"}
{"text":"Okay so we had the late night appetizers it was 10 something at night and they served us impeccable dishes at awesome prices. A flat bread with gorgonzola blue cheese walnuts and pears. It was a great size and could fill a small person but also enough to share. The bbq sliders were cute and also delectable. They had great flavors. We were served 2 on a plate.  He had some caramel coffee beer which smelled just like that. He seemed to like it. And another great thing was that they were super welcoming and wished us well when we left. Our server matthew was super attentive and had our order out fairly quickly, extra dishes for sharing, and kept our water glasses full. I wish I could have taken a picture bc the dishes were instagram worthy! UGH! We will definitely go again next time we visit San Tan outdoor mall."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place to anyone. They have definitely gone downhill since my first visit. The happy hour beer list has been knocked down to just the normal and doesn't include craft beer options which is what I look for. The food is alright but last time I ordered the Scottish Eggs and the yolk was exteremly undercooked. The service is horrible and the hosts spend more time chatting between themselves than helping incoming customers. I felt like I was breaking up a group date just asking for table! They could do much better business being in such a prime location."}
{"text":"My fiance and I made reservations through Open Table over a week ago for my birthday. I really wanted to try Thirsty Lion because it had great reviews online and I love the Fashion Square area.  So we get there, the hostess starts walking towards us and instead of greeting us she just stands there staring at us. After a few seconds, my fiance tells her we have a reservation under Chris. She looks at us and says \"reservation, for Chris?\" looking at us as if she has never heard the term reservation in her life and proceeds to roll her eyes at us. Instead of grabbing menus to seat us, she takes a phone call, leans over the counter and starts to twirl her hair as she spoke with the person on the other line. After a few minutes, she rudely said to follow her to our table. We get to the table and we are both in a horrible mood because of this hostess who clearly hates her job and it showed. Thankfully our waitress was very nice and accommodating. However, our drinks (Pinot Grigio and an Old Fashion) took over 20 minutes to get to our table even though it was a slow night, and the small plates she brought over were dirty which I did point out to her. She came back with another plate and that one was dirty as well so we just decided not to use them. The only nice thing I can say about this place is that the food was good and the waitress was nice. Other than that, there is nothing that will make me want to go back. My fiance and I were there to have a nice dinner and to celebrate my birthday and I cant say that it was a nice experience. I will not be back. I was very tempted to leave and just go over to Shake Shack next door."}
{"text":"I have a problem reviewing this \"Irish Pub\", because it's not. There are very few Irish dishes on the menu, although you can find American, Chinese, etc. BUT... they have one of the very best burgers I've ever tasted! I look constantly for that juicy, grilled, tasty, thick burger, and have found just a few in any of the west coast cities. Of the maybe five I've found, this is one of them. Really delicious. All the food we ordered was very good, as was the beer. The service was also really good and the prices reasonable. Fantastic burgers, but not much Irish. -------------- Returned and discovered I was wrong - it's not actually billed as an Irish restaurant. So, the menu makes more sense now. Had the beef sliders, which were junior sized burgers, which I think are very, very good. My wife had the pretzel, which was big and tasty and the three dips were all very good."}
{"text":"When in Scottsdale where to go? So many choices. We always start here at the most chill pre weekend spot. Food: Awesome!  Bar: Awesome! Feels like a local spot located right in Scottsdale Fashion Square. Never been? Stop in and sit at the bar. Watch an ASU game and feel the love."}
{"text":"Everything about it was just wonderful. I got the quinoa burger and it was quite yummy. One of the best I've had. They have great beer flight options and a full cocktail list. The atmosphere is clean, relaxing and welcoming."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was fabulous. I highly recommend it. It comes with white cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus. The potatoes were to die for! Asparagus was good, nothing special. They woody ends should have been trimmed off. No big deal, I just left them on the plate.  Our server was a bit nonexistent. That really didn't bother me. We didn't need anything and I hate being bothered/interrupted. This method of waiting is actually ideal for me. She showed up to bring initial drinks, then food and once to make sure everything was satisfactory / bring water. Lastly, she offered the check (not in a pushy \"I want to free this table\" way.)  They were able to accommodate me with a nonalcoholic beverage. I ordered the spicy mule, no vodka. It was tasty!   Overall, I had a lovely evening and will definitely be back next time I'm in the mood for a filet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in at 9pm....at 9:15 we were finally asked our drink order. 9:20 my boyfriend's beer and my water arrived. We spent the rest of our time waiting for our waitress to come back before deciding to leave at 9:45. We left cash on the table for the beer and walked out - 9:50. My boyfriend realized he forgot his wallet once we got to our car so he had to walk back in to grab it, and still no one said anything to him. For a night that wasn't particularly busy in the slightest, with no tables seated around us, the service left more to be desired. We ended up driving through Portillo's for food after wasting almost an hour here. Our fault for waiting around as long as we did, but annoying nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Just left the San Tan mall location. Don't sit  at bar-- takes too long to order, get your drink & try to get a bartender's attention. Great food! But we gave up and went elsewhere to enjoy more beverage."}
{"text":"On a friends recommendation, I came to the thirsty lion to try the Baja fish tacos. I sat at the bar during happy hour and it was very busy - the bartenders were swamped. The thirsty lion had lots of waitresses running around but only two bartenders servicing the entire oval bar which is fairly large. They could have used help! I saw a couple other people trying unsuccessfully to flag them down to try and order another drink. I waited for about 10 minutes until finally they saw me and ordered a beer.  The bartender asked me if I was going to eat and I replied yes so they gave me a menu. After that they were so busy and overwhelmed pouring the drinks for the restaurant,  it took them about 15 minutes to get back around to take my order. After ordering the fish tacos it took about 20 minutes for them to bring them. They were very delicious - wrapped in two soft corn shells - grilled cod with shredded lettuce cilantro tomato onion and salsa. Side of delicious black beans comes with it. 3 Tacos were $14 and the beer $5.50.  Total out the door about $25 for tacos and a beer. The beer was ok, but I could have used another - too bad the bartenders were too busy to notice. Maybe I will try try them again - but next time wait until after happy hour subsides."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with some girlfriends and the food was amazing. Love their salads!! The food and service were great! And the manager came by to say hello as well, which was nice. Very happy with our visit!!"}
{"text":"Our local (Phoenix Metro Area) Texas Longhorn fan group (Texas Exe's) gathers at the Thirsty Lion in Tempe each weekend during the football season.  The folks at the Thirsty Lion have a reserved section for us that has multiple large flat screen TVs, a buffet and bar as well.    The friendly and efficient staff are totally awesome and come around to each table to take drink and food orders (prices are reasonable) for those who don't wish to eat at the buffet.  The Thirsty Lion staff and management go out of their way to create a wonderful game time environment that is friendly and welcoming.  Many thanks to them as well as to the senior officers of our local Texas Exe's!  Hook 'em!"}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion is a great place for lunch or dinner, but you may have to wait a little for service. Most recently I came with my family and had dinner in the patio.  It took them a while to seat us and little whole for our waitress to come over, but she was very apologetic and sweet through the rest of the meal.  The tuna rolls are surprisingly excellent, seared ahi and delicious sauce that comes on the plate. On their seasonal menu they had roasted peppers with tatziki, which were also excellent.  For entrées, the spicy mac and cheese, and Romano herb crusted chicken.  The desserts are also very good, never been disappointed with the seasonal desserts.  And the cocktails are quite good, though some of them come out a touch too sweet."}
{"text":"With so many restaurants most food seems to always taste the same but not here. I ordered the pepper jack burger and fries. Hands down the best I've had in a long long time. It couldn't have been prepared any better in my opinion.   We also ordered the spinach tuna roll, shishito peppers and edamame. They were all perfect as well.  Try the ranch dressing with your fries. It's a true peppercorn ranch and is to die for.  If I could give more starts I would!  Thirsty Lion has gained a customer for life."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna Salad...... imagine ahi tuna on top of coleslaw that's heavy on the mayo..... and yes it was that bad."}
{"text":"I love the Thirsty Lion location in Tempe Marketplace. However this particular location could most definitely improve on their attentiveness. The food and drinks are great and they've got a great happy hour. But every time I've gone, it seems not very busy and yet we end up feeling ignored. On more that one occasion, we've waited over 15 minutes before anyone came over to take our drink order. It's happened at the bar, in the dining area, and at a high top in the bar area. We certainly don't mind waiting if it's busy, however, that hasn't been the case for us. I don't know what the problem could be other than that's been made acceptable at this location. I wanted to write this review and bring it to the restaurant's attention because I've talked to multiple people in this area and all have said the same thing and some won't go back."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, the told me \"no, you cant sit at the outside bar, it's closed\"...okay..I'll sit at the inside one. There where only 51 beers on tap, and I have tried all of them numerous times. Nothing special. Not one. Nothing special about the menu either, I ordered 2 apps for myself..the seared ahi, and some potato cakes..both came with this napa slaw, that was great with the ahi, but not to great with the cakes..if you want a pricey beer that you can find anywhere, and an unimaginative menu doused in napa slaw, this is the spot...and don't you dare try to sit at the outside bar, ever."}
{"text":"It rate this just above \"ok\". It was busy, we had the kids and it wasn't the most kid friendly place. We had to chase down the server for ketchup and refills... there were a couple other issues and the food was descent but nothing to return for IMO."}
{"text":"The best thing this place has to offer is the Monday Special (full sized pizza and 2 soft drinks for $20), where you get 2 good for anything/time Harkins (and any location) movie passes. Otherwise, I would never come back here for the food.  We came here with my mom for a bite to eat and she wanted to try someplace new. It was a Monday and it was around 4pm with a few people scattered throughout the restaurant. The second star is for whom I would assume was the manager who seated us, got us set up with menus and was very nice. The Monday deal is also worth its own star.  IF this business reads reviews, please note that sometimes it is ok for your waitstaff to write things down so that food is delivered as ordered.  Beer Cheese soup that husband ordered as a starter arrived with his pizza and was broken and not smooth. The fish and chips my mom ordered was overcooked and dry and my happy hour sized pizza was undercooked and not edible. Food was subpar for the most part but the husband liked his pizza enough.   I would also make sure that your long haired waitresses, tie their hair back a bit so that hair does not end up on the outside of a glass or in food and that your hostesses don't just stand around playing with or stroking their hair extensions. Service pretty much sucked, but we knew we wouldn't be coming back.  So, if you do decide to come- it might be to your taste as everything is subjective. Just as a note, an adult ticket at Harkin's for a nighttime movie is $10 (way less than theaters in the Bay Area) and the Monday special where you get two movie tickets for a $20 pizza that is large enough to share and 2 sodas is a steal of a deal."}
{"text":"Stopped in being in the area after reading Yelp reviews. Service was spot on from the greeting hostess to the bartender who just nailed excellent service. The bar was busy and my order and drinks were all taken care of as if I was the only one at the bar. The food  I bacon burger and they cooked perfectly and full of flavor . Great place to come"}
{"text":"I have now been to this location twice.  If I had reviewed after my first experience I would have given four stars as our service and food were great.  The second time, however, left a lot to be desired.  Our food and beer were good, but that was it.  We wanted to sit at one of the high-top tables in the bar.  We asked one of the servers if they were self-seating and he told us that there wasn't anyone on that side of the bar that could serve us, that they had already been cut.  He told us that the high-tops on the other side of the bar would be fine.  We went over there and the server on that side said that the servers for those high-tops had been cut as well.  We then went back to the host stand, stood for multiple minutes before someone acknowledged us, despite four servers walking past us, and were then finally seated.  We were pretty close to walking out.  We were seated at one of the tables that we were told was closed and the server that had told us that ended up serving us.  She was not warm or friendly and was very abrupt in all of her interactions with us.  She never brought us napkins or silverware, we got them off a different table.  She brought our food out, set it on our table and walked away.  She didn't ask if there was anything we needed, she didn't say a word.  At the end of the meal when we were ready to pay, she took my card for payment and didn't bring it back for seven minutes.  We had very little interaction with her and when we did it wasn't pleasant.  We had thought, after our first visit, that we had found a new restaurant to frequent.  Unfortunately, it looks like we were wrong."}
{"text":"I picked this place as a last minute alternative to our first choice for dinner that was closed on Sunday evening (Lolo's in closed?!).  I was showing my British boyfriend around Phoenix and on our last night in town, we decided to try this place out. First of all, I'm glad it's labeled under American food, because the menu is most definitely not at all British. I came in with my family - 3 kids (two older, one 3 year old) and my sister-in-law who has been in a wheelchair due to an accident. The place wasn't busy so they were able to accommodate our group of 7 with special requests quite quickly. Although I noticed if our table wasn't available, it would have been difficult to seat us since the other empty tables were located a step up above the normal ground level (which would have been very difficult to get to in a wheelchair).  The menu was expansive, although the children complained the kid's menu had a lot left to be desired. Nonetheless, I ordered the pecan salmon, my boyfriend ordered the chicken breast, my sister-in-law the fish and chips (the only British item on the menu! No bangers and mash?!) and my brother ordered the fajitas. Fajitas were not available (ran out of tortillas?) so he opted for the chipotle mac and cheese. In addition to my own dish, I tried the chicken and the mac and cheese, and they all were quite delicious (my favorite being the mac and cheese!). I even stole some of the kids' pepperoni pizza, which is hard to mess up. The salmon dish was great, although a bit outnumbered by the mass amounts of mash and greens, but the contrast to the sweet pecan sauce was amazing.  The service was average, as we had a trainee helping out our table and getting a few drink orders wrong, but nothing that wasn't immediately fixed and forgiven.  As far as my review on this slow Sunday night, all things were good, but seeing some other reviews, it will be interesting to try this place on a busier night."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good. My main issue after calling twice to confirm my reservations, the front desk informed me in front of my guest that I had never made a reservation. I had to show the phone number just to clarify this. Totally unacceptable especially in front of my guest."}
{"text":"Shrimp ceviche was amazing but   too small tasted just amazing!!!!!! Calamari was delicious Crisp with good favor not rubbery. Meat balls not to bad. Flight of beers is always good .. Loud inside but outside with misters and way quieter...."}
{"text":"My wife did a Groupon which is how we found this place while on vacation.  Our server, Shanen, was excellent!  My wife had the ribs which were good.  The vegetables with them were outstanding!  I had the scallops which were exceptional."}
{"text":"This is just what Tempe Marketplace needs! The ambiance is beautiful - upscale but not pretentious. The weighter's are laid back, but very knowledgeable. We sat in the bar area high top and was served by Scott. He was a funky, cool guy and knew his beer! With 52 beers on tap, it was nice to have someone ask questions to. You can get tasters of whatever you like, which is nice before committing!  The pizza is awesome! Hand tossed and wood fired, the dough is chewy and yummy! I had the artichoke pizza - my boyfriend had the pepperoni (he's plain) :)  Prices not too shabby - great happy hour on appetizers. The pint of the day is always $4 all day. Great place to try new beers."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for it and went and had lunch. Food was disappointing I wouldn't waste your time or money. The service was good but we did wait a long time for our food and for the manager to come honour the Groupon. No one asked us how lunch was. The Caesar salad dressing had a very anchovy taste to it even though I asked the waiter and he told me there were no anchovies in it. My sons hamburger looked good but as he picked it up and ate it the bun became very mushy and flat."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place at Tempe Marketplace. It's a super cool atmosphere and is always busy. Because of that we tend to usually sit at the bar. The bartenders up there are awesome, I wouldn't consider myself a regular but I know pretty much all of them which speaks volumes of how friendly they are. Love the Australian bartenders drink combinations, it's always a fun surprise to look at the menu and see what interesting mixes there are. Last night was a grapefruit and basil martini, yum! The food is legit too, my steak was a bit over cooked but they remedied the issue right away and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Thanks to the dude with the sweet mustache! Would recommend this place in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I went on a calm Monday afternoon for a late lunch. The service was friendly and immediate. Our waitress was young, attractive and courteous. The bartender seemed to be a bit new and lost in making drinks fast enough but it wasn't too long of a wait for our margaritas. They were really good actually. I don't understand why restaurants serve mashed potatoes without gravy. No one likes them without some sort of gravy. The filet mignon comes with gravyless mashed potatoes, I asked if they had gravy and she said no. So I got fries instead. I anticipated the lack of gravy. The steak came medium like I asked for it to be but it was still rather tough. I recommend not getting a steak here. The asparagus was a bit tough to cut but everything was seasoned well, even the steak was well seasoned but it was just tough and chewy. The fries are really really really good! Crispy on the outside and soft inside and well salted.  For dessert we got the smores thing that came in a glass. I anticipated it being more so on a plate and presented like a sandwich but instead it was like a pudding but it was layered and soooo good!!! You have to get the s'mores dessert dish!  My friend got the pork wrapped shrimp with white rice and some sliders and the shrimp was really good!"}
{"text":"Very happy with this place! Got the Garlic Sesame Edamame (my favorite), pub fries (amazing ranch dip), and spinach artichoke dip (flavor was on point).  Super reasonable prices during happy hour ($4 well drinks and margs) and we ended with cocktails that were phenomenal. Service was fine, though not very personable when asking for recommendations. We'll definitely be back at some point."}
{"text":"I have previously only had great experiences at this restaurant, but tonight was an exception. Amidst being seated outside, a rowdy group of drunk men catcalled my daughter and I as we went to our seats, saying they had \"two open seats next to them.\" Throughout our entire night there, they were extremely loud and obnoxious, yelling at every server and female worker that walked past them. They were extremely rude, even throwing napkins over the fence outside. I am surprised the management did not kick them out, but rather kept serving them drinks? The funniest part was our waitress seemed to enjoy their attention; more concerned about these drunks than giving us proper service. Was a disappointing experience at a usually great restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night around 7pm. The restaurant had 2 large groups of 15-20 and probably half the remaining tables occupied. Our server seemed to be having an \"off\" night as it took a full 12-15 minutes after we were seated to be asked about what we wanted for drinks. With this being the case we decided to place our full order. We ordered the scotch eggs for an appetizer, Ahi Poke bowl and ahi tuna salad. The scotch eggs never arrived, both entrees were difficult to eat as they were really heavily sauced. Made it through half, and lost confidence when it came to desert. We were actually excited to try as the menu looked great. Problem was they tried to be everything to everybody. Really need to trim the menu and focus on what they do best. Ahi is not that."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for healthy meal after a workout with my buddies. I was really pleased with their menu because they had a lot of options for all preferences. However, there only salmon option was a hardy meal. I asked the waitress if they could substitute the chicken in one of their salads for salmon and she assured me they could. When I got the bill I was charged for the $13 salad plus a $9  side of salmon. She agreed that was a really expensive salad and had her manager adjust it for me. She was really polite and service was great, but this place is definitely over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"As I am not a 19 year old girl there aren't many reasons for me to spend extended  time at the Marketplace.  I have heard good things about the pub and decided to make an exception.  The decor and ambiance are standard 'bar/pub'.  The food was a pleasant notch above what you'd get in the Gordon Biersches of the world.  Definitely some of the better fish and chips in the valley."}
{"text":"I met a business associate here for lunch yesterday. They have only been open for two weeks so I was a bit apprehensive as to whether they have worked out the \"kinks\" yet. I was pleasantly surprised! The server was very attentive although the inexperience showed when after servicing us, she immediately returned to ask how our food was... we had not had time to take a bite yet! Lol BUT, the food was very good and I will definitely make this one of my luncheon spots to meet clients. I had the enchilida stack. Very tasty. The bar is huge and I think it would be a great place to meet up with the gang to watch a game or hold a mixer. It is clean and the staff is very courteous... all of them have big smiles and lots of hellos and thanks yous as you depart. The prices are a bit higher than your average grill... but honestly, the food is worth it in my opinion. They are new to the game, so be patient and in a short while this place will be seasoned enough to compete with the rest!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times this weekend. Once yesterday to cool off and have a couple drinks for happy hour and again today for lunch with my family.  The food: All the food we tried and share was phenomenal. Some things we all had were the ahi poke, steak salad, reuben, sliders, hummus and pretzel bites. All good came out hot and seemed to be fresh. Presentation was also wonderful!   The drinks: Great assortment of beers and craft drinks. If you go and it's hotter than 105 outside, you can get a very delicious mule for half off!   The service: The service is where this place really excels even over the drinks and food. Both the bartender the first day and the waiter the second day were extremely attentive to our needs and our drink glasses.   Although I only get to Arizona a few times a year which isn't enough for me, this place is well worth going out of your way for. The building and interior in and of itself is really cool looking!   Until next time Thirsty Lion!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The food is always fresh. It is a bar and is quite noisy so it's not the most romantic place to eat."}
{"text":"Great patio, lots of parking and lots of beer options. The crowd is hit or miss though. I came with coworkers and had some very obnoxious college kids next to us that ruined the experience. I recommend this place for groups of friends but not groups of coworkers."}
{"text":"loved the atmosphere awesome staff. very knowledgeable about their beverages and their food menus. I had questions they had answers.  I liked my experience."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and I like the space.  But the food, drinks and service is just \"ok\". Not my first choice of places to go."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always have great food and good service. it's good for a happy hour, date, a guy's night out ... you name it.  recommend getting the seasonal mahi mahi. otherwise get the chicken penne or Salmon with asparagus risotto."}
{"text":"I had the worse service ever. I loved this restraunt, but when my friend and I celebrated her 21st birthday, the waiter acted more intoxicated that she was. We did not get checked in on once, I had to ask the waiter 3X for sweet in low, it too exactly 28 minutes for us to receive our check after our waiter took our plates. The waiter was horrible and was to cocky to pay attention to anyone but himself. The manager was alright, but didn't seem to care about how horrible if an experience we were having. We were ready to walk out, but we waited for the bill. Ruined her 21st burger day. It used to be our favorite restaurant, and will ever go back to this location again. Honestly it's over crowded, and with as much money as we are paying we should receive at least decent service."}
{"text":"We went for my boyfriends birthday and had an amazing time!! The food and service were amazing, our waitress Savana was super sweet and gave us ice cream for my boyfriend's birthday! Highly recommended this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and there's always bee one problem but this was horrendous.  Waited 30 min for my drink to arrive.  The food actually came out first.  I asked about it,  they then brought two, one had alcohol in it and one didn't.   Menu say \"1.00 off all drafts.\" They didn't tell us until they brought the bill that Guinness and Stella were not included.  What part of all means there are exclusions.  Horrendous service.  This was just my experience as I was with several other and everyone had an issue"}
{"text":"It was honestly just overpriced \"ok\" food and a stuffy staff. Not one smile flashed at our table and waitress never came around after we got our food to refill drinks...on a Sunday afternoon.   Got the fish'n'chips since that's what we were all craving and the reviews had recommended we try. I asked the waitress if she recommend then and she stuff that it was one of their more popular dishes.   Honestly, greasy and bland. I get that it's AZ and getting fresh fish is what it is but...but...no. This was just wrong. Doughy batter, no seasoning on the fish at ALL, overcooked fries - NOT CHIPS!  NOW, other things here might be great, but..."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill is quite a unique name with a meaning that hits home.  Known for their huge drink menu, and delicious handcrafted food, Gastropub seems to be the perfect description for such a restaurant.  Combing the words Gastronomy, meaning \"the art of choosing, cooking, and eating good food,\" and Pub, meaning bar, gives you Gastropub.  I felt as though Thirsty Lion did a fantastic job convincing me that they are in fact, deserving of such a title.   Ambience/Atmosphere: I recently visited Thirsty Lion for my second-time last week with a few friends around 7:30. They appeared rather busy, but we were sat almost immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the vast amount of open space that was well utilized by the restaurant.  The restaurant consists of a very even share of 4-6 person tables, 4-6 person high-top tables, and 4-8 person booths that all surrounds one central bar with about 50+ bar seats. It was obvious this restaurant could accommodate a huge amount of people at one time.  The four of us were sat in a corner booth near a service station/computer for servers to input orders and refill drinks, which we didn't mind.  The booth itself was more than spacious and surprisingly comfortable.  The restaurant is very dim-lit with candles on tables casting most of the light required for menu-viewing.    Food/Pricing: The drink menu was incredibly huge, as if the food menu wasn't overwhelming enough.  They had at least 30 beers on tap, and a huge selection of wine. I guarantee it would be hard to find a drink you didn't like being that they offered many different hard alcohols as well, with vodkas ranging from Deep Eddy to Tito's and even Grey Goose. The drinks of course came at a cost.  However, I would argue that the drinks weren't particularly expensive compared to other restaurants I've been to.  I have yet to be there for happy hour, but I've heard there happy hour offers exceptional deals, while still offering a large variety to choose from.  We decided to start off with the Smoked Chicken Nachos as an appetizer.  The description of nearly all the dishes on the menu were quite extensive and included many unique ingredients. Our nachos, however, may have been an exception as they were pretty standard as far as nachos come, Tortilla chips, beans, cheese, salsa, chicken and jalapenos.  The cilantro sour cream was probably the best part.  We all split the nachos and it was plenty for the four of us, we couldn't even finish. At $13 for the app it was well worth the price as it satisfied us all.  I ordered the Gastropub Burger which consisted of a gorgonzola infused burger with grilled sweet onion, maple pepper bacon, white cheddar, arugula and horseradish cream.  I am a huge horseradish fan.  It came with the option of fries, coleslaw, or a salad, and as per usual, I chose the fries. I ordered my burger medium-rare, and it came out perfectly.  The burger was juicy and large; however, I didn't love the way the flavors combined.  I tasted very little horseradish, and the gorgonzola was the dominant flavor. The bacon was cooked right, and tasted amazing, but the fries were mediocre.  Again, the portion was huge, and I could not finish.  Service: Karly was our server and displayed great menu knowledge, while also being very prompt and friendly.  She helped us decide based on our taste preferences, and warned us about items with strong or spicy flavors.  She was able to answer any and all questions we asked.      I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this for a long time, finally made it.  A Groupon made it easier.    We started with the ahi poke.  I have complained about the poke places that have been popping-up lately.  They all commit the same sin:  they put the cold tuna sashimi on top of hot rice.  Also they don't seem to marinate the fish much.  Well, here it was done properly.  The sashimi was marinated and had a good flavor, it was slightly cold, and was served on cool rice.  So the sashimi remained cool the entire time we were eating it.   I also ordered the \"enchilada stack\".  Rather than rolling the enchiladas in a traditional fashion they simply stack tortillas and the filling items (chicken, etc), smother it with sauce and bake it slightly crispy.  It was good.  The beans were simple but surprisingly good, and the side of chips and salsa was nice too.   Service was very good.  Our server was friendly, helpful choosing items from the menu, and efficient.    My primary complaint would be about the room itself.  It was LOUD.  Very loud.  That was at least in part because the spacing of the tables is too tight.  I do not exaggerate when I say I was sitting closer to the man at the next table than i was to my wife on the other side of our table.  Thus I was able to hear all about his adventures/trials/tribulations which he was discussing with his companion.  Not his fault.  He was only an arm's length away.  Next time I will request a booth.  They seemed to be a little more private.  They really should have enough space between tables for a person to walk between them.  This did detract somewhat from the experience, which is a shame because the food was good.  I debated between 3 and 4 stars on this one.  I opted to round down because of the ambiance I just described.  I would say the portions are a bit small.  I expected that with the ahi as sushi-grade tuna is very expensive in Phoenix, but the enchilada entree probably should have been larger given the price.  That said, a nearby table had ordered the \"nachos\" and the portion seemed to be quite generous.  So it may depend on which entree you order.  We will be back.  I would like to try something a bit more traditional next time (sandwiches looked good)."}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G, you've got to check this place out. Moscow Mules, Creme Brûlée....need I say more? They have a huge menu with something to fit everyone's craving. We have tried so many different things on the menu from Salmon, Orange Chicken, Reuben's, and Tacos and have not been disappointed yet. It makes picking an entree so hard when everything has been amazing. If you don't drink alcohol, try an iced tea, not sure what they use but those are great too. We've always had great service too!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here a couple nights ago with friends and it was packed! What impressed me is they let us grab drinks at the bar while we were waiting for a table. They told us it might take twenty minutes but we only waited maybe 15 minutes.   Our server's name was Justin and he was awesome. He was outgoing, friendly and funny. It's nice to have some personality with a server even if things are hectic and they have tables all over.   He was patient with us trying to figure out what we wanted. He even took the time to go back in the kitchen to find out what was in one of their sauces. My friend has bad allergies and has to be careful. She did not even mention that to him and he still went out of his way for her.  I ordered the steak salad and it was perfect. I am not even joking. Lettuce tasted fresh, steak was cooked as I ordered and they deep fry their onions for a topping. I was amazed at how much everything tasted fresh. I don't know what was in the dressing but it rocked.  My friend had the lamb and I think she died and went to heaven. She's not easily impressed with food either.  Her boyfriend had the burger sliders and they were lacking cheese. Only thing that would have made the entire meal perfect."}
{"text":"Our daughter chose this place to have her ASU Grad party.  We rented the room on the left side of dining room and part of the patio.  The service was outstanding.  We worked with Blanche on ordering the food.  Her and her team did an amazing job.  We had sliders, pizza, chicken fingers, veggie and fruit trays.  We had about 75 people there.  Great personalities and interaction from all the servers and bartenders.  Was a great decision to select this place."}
{"text":"I thought my salad for lunch was expensive for what I got.  Probably paying for the atmosphere which is trying to be an upscale pub."}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE restaurant. The Poke is AMAZING, as well as the pizzas, the appetizers (we've had them all and you should too!) The service is always great as well. I would recommend this place to anyone. The food is high quality and doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"It was St. Paddy's Day and we were perusing Tempe Marketplace for a decent hole in the wall when Hubby and I became so thirsty and hungry enough to eat a lion...hence the Thirsty Lion!  Wow, what a cool place.  It's hard to believe that I've walked past this place so many times speeding to get to Kabuki or California Kitchen without ever giving it a thought...but it just never called to me. Let's just say, I don't look for food, food finds me!  But I gotta tell ya, the minute we walked in we felt at home.  The place is mega-big, but you don't feel it at all.  Every section of the room is closed-in enough to give it a dining-room feel.  The waitstaff knows the real deal about service. We started at the bar because there were a lot of thirsty people waiting for a table and Scott, the bartender, made us feel like we were long-lost friends.  Get this...he introduced himself and shook our hands...what?! We were sold out right there.  And it was genuine.  When his shift ended, we wanted to close our tab so we could pay and tip him personally.  But he said, \"not to worry, the whole staff share all the tips.\" I thought I died and went to heaven's restaurant.  When we got our table, we met Austin who was just as cool and down to earth to interact with.  I mean I've had great service before but it never felt like I walked into my friend's dining room."}
{"text":"Terrible service from Scott H, super slow for food and drink orders.  Try the bar next time."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed. Came in for happy hour and the portion sizes were very small for the price. Better off going to yard house or BJ's for better food and more for your money. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went to the Tempe market today place location. Extremely crowded due to spring training and proximity to the ball park. Had a large group meeting in the bar. Did have to ask the hostess more than once to be able to get more tables as our party kept getting bigger. Stated they had a reservation waiting but there were plenty of open tables and I'd figure they might want to make money on people already there eating and drinking. Finally agreed to let us have another table. Had the salmon cakes they were mediocre."}
{"text":"We had the girl meet up to celebrate and enjoyed fresh salads with great drinks from Alex! The service was great, and the atmosphere was fun! Definitely recommend the ahi tuna salad, and the signature drinks are on point. We had a great time!!!"}
{"text":"Diet Coke - food was good but it took an hour to get white no lines - not sure what was going on tonight - then the orders were wrong. Maybe a new cook right now.  He food we got was very good"}
{"text":"Could the employees here get anymore attractive?! Geez, it is like an Abercrombie ad. I practically expect to see Zac Efron walk out the door serving drinks. That being said, I've also received outstanding service each drop in for grub. During this most recent visit, server Rodrigo was even kind enough to move an umbrella so the glaring sun would not hit us in the face anymore! The food is pretty solid and I love the rotating seasonal options. Thirsty Lion is definitely one of the places I prefer to eat while dining at TMP."}
{"text":"The service was poor. I asked for no meat on my flatbread, only to receive it with meat. They took it back for a \"new\" one, so I had to eat my soup and wait 15 more minutes only for them to bring back the same bread only with no meat. It tasted like the bacon, and the bread was soggy."}
{"text":"Sadly, we had bad drinks and bad food last night. Went after a movie, around 9:30 pm and ordered some of their specialty cocktails. If you are going to have them on the menu, someone should be trained how to make them. Our food, which we ordered off the reverse happy hr menu was equally as disappointing. We got pretzels and beer cheese-how can you mess that up? Turns out you can.   Maybe they have their good chefs and good bartenders on when it is busier...I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Walked in with a party of ten on Monday Nite and it only took 15 minutes to be seated. The service was excellent. The food from pizza to the burgers was suberb."}
{"text":"Round two... well at least it wasn't hot as hell.  It was slow.  Really slow.  Order a beer....10 - 15 min later you might get your drink.  Sometimes more.  Food is good, beer selection is good.   Execution needs work.     Thirsty lion.... of course you're thirsty, it's hot as hell in this place.  I mean at some point why bother having walls.  It's surface of the sun, swamp-ass hot in this place.  You drink to live.   Get with the program and get some AC up in this place.  Food pretty middle of the road, and kinda pricey for its middle of the road nature.  The decor is aimed at up-scale, which begs the question why the heck they can't get the climate control working.   Service is on the slow to very slow side.  Other than the reasonable location there's not much reason to go back."}
{"text":"CLASS ACT!  I hosted a birthday get together at the Scottsdale location.  The Manager Don & his staff could have not been more accommodating.  Don set us up with reserved seating by the bar, set up an additional table for the food I pre-ordered for my guests & staggered the food as I requested.  Normally I spend time away from my guests to supervise the arrival of food & chase down the wait staff for my guests.  Don & his staff made MY night fun & effortless. I didn't have to make requests and the wait staff were ever-present.   I was able to spend time with my friends and enjoy the evening.    As the night went on, I requested additional food & dessert to be brought out.  Everything looked and tasted great.  There was not one drop left. All  of my guess remarked how good the food was.  I asked the wait staff to make sure my guests 1st drink was on my bill & then the rest would be on separate bills.  They did not go one drink over.  Eric & CJ kept coming over to check on us regularly. They were so friendly and polite. Each one shook my husband's hand & wished him a happy birthday.  As we left for the evening, we were in the parking lot & one of the hostesses who help us upon arrival stopped as she was driving by to wish him a happy birthday & make sure our evening went well.  A real class act.    I should mention again, the food was awesome.  We had everything from sliders, to chicken tenders to flat breads to sushi....and an incredible brownie dessert.  Everything was brought out hot, & well presented.  We have been to the Thirsty Lion before for dinner & have always been pleased.  I host this party every year and have not been as happy with the food & service elsewhere as I was this year with the Thirsty Lion.  We will be back to host there next year. (...for dinner sooner!)    If you are looking for a great place with great food and GREAT STAFF..... this is your hot spot for dinner or a party.  Thank you Don & Staff for making this a fun & carefree night."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with an observant staff and a great selection of drinks and food. The French dip was awesome and the Brest soaked up the meat and sauce without losing soft solid texture. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate their food, but when the hostess sat my fiancé and I, we literally waited half an hour and didn't even receive service at all, not even water or anything. The waitress did stop by and said she would get us water after waiting 30 min, then left again, after waiting another 10 min I was so fed up and ended up leaving."}
{"text":"To whet palates this summer, the Thirsty Lion Garstropub & Grill in Tempe and Scottsdale has introduced a limited-time menu featuring fresh seasonal ingredients, and the food is just as vibrant to look at as it is to taste. I headed to the restaurant to try their summer menu and left feeling full and satisfied, with happy taste buds.  My pal and I noshed on tempura fried green beans to start ($6.95) which came with a sambal chili lime dipping sauce I absolutely loved. I gobbled up every last green bean, which was thickly battered but not overly greasy. I appreciated that the appetizer did have a healthy component to it in the green beans, and they were absolutely addictive - I could have kept eating them!  I got the fresh heirloom tomato caprese salad ($9.95) for my meal, which came with a side of spring greens topped with a white balsamic vinaigrette. The tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil were covered in sea salt and a maple balsamic glaze, and I loved this caprese for the thickness of the tomatoes. Everything tasted so fresh, and the glaze to veggie/cheese ratio was appropriate.  My friend got the smoked chicken and pesto pizza ($14.95), a huge portion that is perfect for two people, especially if you're getting an appetizer first. She loved the addition of Kalamata olives on the pie, which also included spinach basil pesto, house smoked chicken, chili flakes, roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, a four-cheese blend and arugula. She liked the thick crust on the edge, which made it easy to hold, while the thin crust throughout the rest let the toppings shine.  Other entrees on the summer menu include grilled romaine and steak salad ($14.95), mesquite smoked St. Louis ribs ($20.95), seared Atlantic sea scallops ($19.95) and grilled wild Northwest salmon ($24.95). The seasonal cocktails looked mighty tasty and include fresh fruit sangria made with brandy and triple sec, and a raspberry mint mule-jito, made with fresh raspberries muddled with mint, lemon and lime, Bacardi Rum, Malibu rum, simple syrup and Reed's Ginger Beer. I didn't try a cocktail on my lunch break this time, but the drink looked beautiful and seems to be strong, judging by the ingredients.  For dessert, satiate your fresh fruit fix with a strawberry rhubarb and white chocolate cheesecake slice ($6.95), made with fresh whipped cream, strawberry rhubarb puree and fresh sliced strawberries in a chocolate-hazelnut crust. Our meals left us stuffed, so save room for this decadent dessert if you're into those flavors.  The summer menu is available through mid-September."}
{"text":"A bar and restaurant opened at Tempe Marketplace that differentiates itself from the typical outdoor mall chains-Thirsty Lion Pub and Grill, the first location in Arizona with only two additional ones in Oregon. The Thirsty Lion is populated with sexy female servers in cute outfits and has an extensive menu of pub fare and 52 draft beers.   I had soup and salad for lunch, with a garden salad and beer cheese soup ($8.95). This was my first time trying this kind of soup, and while it was probably made well, the beer taste was a little overwhelming for me. Don't order this unless you're a huge fan of beer.  My salad was great and came with cucumber, carrot, red pepper, onion and croutons. The portion was generous, and the greens were leafy, and as far as soup and salad at sports bars go, this combo was one of the best I've had based on the portion and ingredients.  My pal tried the Southwest Smoked Chicken Salad ($11.95), which was also an enormous portion and looked mighty tasty.  There were a ton of other menu items that made me salivate, and I wish I could have tried them all. If I go back, I'm going to have to decide between the brick oven pizzas, the ultimate nachos and the chipotle mac and cheese. Everything sounded really great, and the service was friendly, too.  If you don't want to sit on the patio, the dark interior features lots of sports televisions and a masculine atmosphere of wood furnishings. The place reminded me a little of D'Arcy McGee's, so if you're on the other end of Tempe Marketplace, you have another option for pub fare."}
{"text":"This place is great for late night snacks for all taste buds! My boyfriend and I always get out of work around 10pm and we never really have a place to eat that isn't fast food. I'm not positive when their happy goes until, but when I am there at 10-12am, it's always amazing prices with a wide range of food"}
{"text":"Great pub feel.  Lots of TV'S to watch sports.  Great cocktail and beer menu.  But that is where the \"typical sports bar\" feel ends.  The food menu is so much better than your fried bar food!!  The kale salad is the best we've ever had.  The tavern burger was very tasty and we loved the grilled artichoke was a wonderful diversion from the typical appetizer.  Service friendly and attentive.  The manager Sean even made time to thank us for coming in for the first time.   Will definitely be back.   Thank you for striving for quality and not quantity!!"}
{"text":"Great Fish and Chips than most places!  Service has been sketchy for some reason but the food is great.  We will keep trying!"}
{"text":"We got an invite at our work to dine here for free so we figured hey, why not?  We're always up for trying new restaurants!  There were 5 of us total and we tried the brussels sprouts appetizer as well as the pretzel with amber ale fondue to start.  The brussels sprouts were surprisingly good, cooked with a little bit of bacon (which makes almost anything better).  The pretzel itself was ok - nothing too exciting.  The fondue was too much beer, not enough cheese.  Stick with cheese fondue for pretzels, people!  Entrees...  I had the french dip.  Others had the chicken caprese sandwich and fish and chips.  All were decent.  I do not like the dip for the french dip.  It has rosemary in it and it just tasted like an herb juice, which I did not enjoy.  The sandwich itself was quite tasty.  The fish and chips were decent, perhaps a bit too much breading.  The chicken caprese sandwich was very good.  Now for the best part - dessert!  Where the dip for the pretzels tasted like beer, the black butte brownie is not overpowered by beer.  It was delicious!  The blackberry cobbler was also very tasty but oh so mushy.  Other notes:  Our server was great - very friendly, made great recommendations, and kept our beverages full.  They make their own lemonade here and it was pretty good.  The restaurant itself gets an A+ for atmosphere.  Every part of the restaurant looks awesome, including the restrooms.  I would definitely recommend coming here.  The menu has a huge variety of items (almost too much) and I look forward to trying something new on a future visit!"}
{"text":"Good place for a business lunch. I've gone several times with clients and the food has been good. Nothing that truly stands out but good. I think my favorite item so far was the Beer Cheese Soup. Very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, the menu has a delightful variety of food. The food could be a little bit better quality. Quality seems like an after thought. Lovely atmosphere, my wife and I used to visit quite often. One major complaint is the waitstaff. My wife and I have been to the Tempe Marketplace, SanTan Village and Scottsdale Fashion Square locations, and have had apathetic waiters(tresses) at each location. Not every waiter, but each location has had its share. Perhaps waitstaff training could be a bit more involved and extensive. 3 out of 5 stars for a mediocre experience. Wish it could be better because the atmosphere is quite lovely."}
{"text":"First visit, today. We arrived after 1:00p and sat on the patio. Great start. Then we waited for a beer way too long. Does it really take that long to draw a draft and get it to a table? The menu has a lot to offer and I decided on the caprese chicken sandwich, it sounds fresh tasting when you read the ingredients. For me, they ruin the concept of caprese fresh by over dressing the roll to the point of drowning it. I chose to leave the roll and eat the chicken, cheese and tomato. The greens were so oiled they were left as well. Now on to the fries, way too oily as if the fryers were not hot enough to cook them before soaking up a bunch of cooking oil. The reason I'm going with a three star rating is because of the beer and bacon wrapped datesand my wife liked her Reuben sandwich. BTW, she ordered the thousand island dressing on the side. We'll try it again sometime but it's not on our short list. Hope this helps management as well."}
{"text":"Word of advice...check prices before eating here. Apparently they (so says the server) recently raised their prices due to a higher minimum wage.  Nice try Thirsty Lion.   Your prices are seriously ridiculous.  A burger, two diet cokes and 3 fish tacos costs $40!  You do know you are in Tempe and connected to a mall right?  $16 for fish tacos?!?  Lesson learned.  I'm not paying your higher minimum wage prices for food that is just...decent.  No thanks"}
{"text":"Third visit and this was the worst one. Our waitress seemed distracted and not very helpful. My husband asked for something and she said \"hmm, I don't know\". If he didn't say can you check on it, she would have left it at that. The lemons that we got forWe ordered a salad and a veggie panini and it took about 40 minutes! The panini was cooked on one side and burned on the other as well as coming out cold. My salad was soggy....and our waitress is nowhere to be found. The hostess was friendly. The manager did discount our bill though"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed. I order all across the board so anything from pizza, to grilled fish, or a salad - it has all been very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Beer, Apps, Good Conversation! What more can a girl ask for?! It was Halloween and we made a pitstop during a shopping trip to get a draft beer and charcuterie board! Everyone who works there is so nice and accommodating. They let us try 3 or 4 of the beers since we obviously were very decisive.... I highly recommend. Great casual and trendy restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever at the bat with three bartenders working.  Great place to go if you like being ignored."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch bite after some shopping and had the Charcuterie, Pulled Pork Sliders, and the Burger Sliders. The Charcuterie was a selection of aged Italian meats and cheeses, which was very tasty, as were the pulled pork sliders. The burger sliders were just ok. They are on Opentable as well. We would go back for the pulled pork sliders for sure. See photos."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for lunch during a shopping trip at San tan village. I had the salmon which was honestly the best salmon I've had in years. My daughter also very much enjoyed her chicken tenders. A manager by the name of Kelsey came and sparked up some awesome conversation during our visit. Overall I was so pleasantly surprised and I will most definitely be coming back with my family soon. I can't wait to have the salmon again!!"}
{"text":"While in the area and looking to watch s hockey game on tv, decided to give this place a try. There are plenty of screens to watch but at the same time, they are not so many that they are over whelming. With the dark wood interior and the low lighting, it still feels like an English pub. The menu is quite large and varied to satisfy all tastes.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl. It was very good with large pieces of tuna and was so large I could not finish it. The beer selection has both local and nationally known favorites."}
{"text":"I went to Thirsty Lion with a friend. I got the NW Pub Burger. The sandwich tasted good, but it wasn't an extraordinary burger. In fact, the bottom bun was a bit soggy.  But I'll definitely come back for three reasons. First, Thirsty Lion has PEACH ALE and it's much better than the peach ale served at Buffalo Wild Wings on Rural and University. Second, the atmosphere and service are great. The bartenders are friendly and attentive. Third, Thirsty Lion has brick oven pizza."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for a server and no one ever showed up to our table. 3 other tables were served while we waited to order drinks. I asked to speak to a manager about the situation and he did not seem to care about the situation at all. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Great food! Great Service!  My wife and I went there for happy hour and ended up liking the food so much we just continued to order plates. All the food was fantastic and was brought out to our specifications. (Sometimes we can be a little picky how we order certain dishes.) Drinks were decently priced. My wife's vodka cranberry was literally overflowing with ice, so make sure you ask for no ice. Other then that one thing... We loved and would definitely go back for some more."}
{"text":"I had a lunch date there on a weekday. The hostess was new , super sweet and pretty. I asked for some suggestions from the menu and she was more than happy to give her favorites off the menu. Service was great the manager came around to check on everyone and the food was superb. I had the pepper cheese burger  and my friend ahi salad. I will definitely return to the Thirsty Lion!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the portion sizes but the food is delicious!  A bit warm this time, but maybe they were not yet expecting the high temps outside."}
{"text":"This Place is Amazing Just became my new favorite place.  We went their today 1st time and  for our 19th anniversary and Valentines day.. From the moment  we walked it   i give it 5 stars  if i could id give it 10.. Out Waiter was Dragon Hes was amazing and so helpful and fun. And a small world it is  we had friends that we all knew .. The Food was oh so delish  the  Bacon Wrapped Prawns were the best ive ever had along with slaw with it ...My husband had  Sicilian Panini** he said he could eat that all day ..when we had finished our meal  They brought us a free desert and a card signed from  most of the waitresses and waiters and mgrs  . That was  very nice  never been to a  place that did that ... then they comped our Bacon Wrapped Prawns.. Our First time here was the best we endured in a long Time..  We thank you Thirsty Lion for amazing experience we had today .. We will be back and ask for Dragon  he works from thur to sunday 3-9"}
{"text":"Big place in Tempe Marketplace. Lots of outdoor seating. Great for gourmet beer lovers. Didn't try the food but many folks were on dinner dates"}
{"text":"Was there last week, they have alot of choices for draft beer. Will be back soon to try 'em all :) of course with the Edamame for snacking. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the Thirsty Lion tonight thanks to the good staff excellent service and wonderful food. We wete visiting from Portland, OR and went out for dinner and to watch the Beavers in the College World Series. The manager Brian made us feel more than at home and spent a quality few minutes getting to know us and making sure that we were well taken care of. Nicki was our server and she was bright and enthusiastic and checked on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed and also enjoyed some conversation with us. It's why we keep going here they know how to treat people it's great food and an awesome atmosphere. Definitely recommend going for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love their Kung Pao Chicken. Definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Wasn't my first experience with Thirsty Lion but it was for my girl and one of my best buddies from out of state; food was amazing, love the atmosphere, and drinks were on par. Service was great given how busy it was. Parking kinda stinks but that's no fault of their own."}
{"text":"Came here for a going away party for a co-worker who was going to greener pastures.  We wanted to grab two tables as people would be coming and going to say their good byes on a Thursday night.    I wish the wait staff would write everything down because they got some of our food orders wrong.  My friend pointed out the pizza, but was delivered pretzels.  Instead of taking back the pretzels they said they could comp him with free soup.    The food was good, nothing great, but nothing horrible.  Great beer selection, but horrible wine and hard alcohol selection.  The biggest problem is the bartenders. I would expect them to know how to pour draft beer in a pub.  There was no head on the beer.  I'm not a big head fan, but the head is there to bring out the beer's essence.  I tried ordering a B&B for a night cap, but they didn't have it so I got a Grand Marnier.  They served in a shot glass.   I think this is the only bar I've been to around the world (I've been to many places) that served Grand Marnier in a shot glass.  Maybe they thought it was like Jagermeister?"}
{"text":"We were promptly seated.  Outside is my preference and it's a beautiful 70 something.  Light, hip atmosphere with outdoor music.  We got here for restaurant week.  It ends on the 27th, so get out if you can. It looked like some great options but we weren't that hungry.  I started with a grapefruit basil martini.  Good.  Not great.  Kind of bland.  But the basil makes it smell wonderful.  We had the bacon wrapped dates.  OMG!  This is a must.  4 per order.  Also had an ample sized arugula salad in the middle with a balsamic reduction.  And it was salty.  Hmm. For the main dish we had the seeded steak salad.  The picture is of 1/2 the order.  We had them split it in the kitchen.  And thank goodness.  But it was an overwhelming amount of leaves.  Very little of anything else.  I kept getting a gritty texture in my bites and an earthy taste.  So I'm not sure if they washed the lettuce very well.  The steak was seasoned well and cooked correctly.   Service is slow but friendly.  Good chance you won't get a refill on your drink unless you are proactive about it."}
{"text":"Good location, nice beer/drink selection, decent happy hour prices.  Food happy hour items are not what I would consider a deal though, so just go for drinks.  The service is speedy and friendly, even with a packed house during happy hour."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this new restaurant at San Tan Mall area on Saturday afternoon.  Its convenient and a great place to meet with friends on the patio or in the beautiful bar.  I was so sadly disappointed from the beginning of the check in process.  Thinking that maybe they didn't have it all together, I figured it would get better.  They are brand new and should be on top of their game with excellent food and service, right?  There were so much staff when we put our name in, it was a little overwhelming, don't they have silverware to roll or something? The gal in the white batman dress who took our name on the wait list was a little spacey. She attempted to take our name multiple times all the while we sat and waited for our table. No smile, no personality.  We should have left at that point.  Our party consisted of 4 and none of us had been there before.  Our waitress also lacked personality and we could barely hear her. Its a loud restaurant/bar.  She made no recommendations when we stated this was our first time dining there.  I ordered a chicken ceasar salad.  It was good, nothing extra special.  It was quite small, so I thought it would be the side salad price of $5.95, however when I received the bill it was $12.95, holy moly!!!! That's ridiculously priced!!!!  My friend has a pear bruscetta and she enjoyed it.  My daughter was interested in dessert, in which we had to ask for a menu.  She ordered a hot fudge sundae.  It was $6.95 for 2 scoops of ice cream and hot fudge.  There was more whipped cream on the sundae than ice cream.  So disappointed, definitely will not be back.  I much rather head over to Kona Grill or Gordon Biersch with excellent service and signature food.  Nothing special here as service was poor and unfriendly, food was over priced and nothing special."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the service here at all. My 3 year olds 3 chicken strips and 7 fries were brought out at least 15 minutes after our entrees. Funny since she told the server 3x she wanted chicken nuggets & fries and I also ordered it for her. Server knew she messed up and basically hid until we had waived over the manager check on it & bring it out.  She also screwed up our appetizer order.  Weak apology on why something that we asked about 3x and should have taken 3 minutes to fry up was so late.  3 stars as the food was decent and I'm willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Only been here once but I cant go back. Maybe i'll try it again if im going drinking because theyre beer selection looked great. Our food was over cooked and just not very tasty. And the service at the time of my visit was the worst i'd had in years. They were apologetic about it but there was no organization or communication or even focus between the wait staff."}
{"text":"Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail.  There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasn't that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.    I wasn't planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, it's not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I Loved it! Fist time here they have everything from sushi to pasta! It was perfect! Food was Mouth watering and servers were on point!"}
{"text":"I have been consistently disappointed in the service at most Scottsdale restaurants since moving here about six months ago.  Can't say that about this joint.  Our waitress was Lindsey and she was on the ball from the second we got there.  Ordered a pear martini and a craft beer flight, calamari for appetizer and then shared the shrimp tacos and bleu cheese burger that was on special.  The main courses were a little cold when they came out, but the flavor was great for everything so it wasn't a deal breaker.  Calamari was crispy and fresh, the aioli to dip them in was perfectly seasoned and both the tacos and burger were cooked and seasoned to perfection.  While removing the plates from our table, a salsa spilled and splashed onto our clothes.  This kind of thing happens often to us, for reasons unknown, but the way it was handled was as good as it could be without discounting the check.  After apologizing, the manager stopped by to make sure everything was ok.  While there I noticed you can get 1/2 price off your pizza if you're there before or after a movie, which is something to remember for next time.  The prices were still a little steep, but hands down the best service we've had at any joint in this mall.  Since the only other one I've been to was in Tempe Marketplace, this location definitely impressed me more!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Burger at this establishment. Vibe also was goos. Staff friendly and margarita was strong ans cold. Would definitely go back. Previously had the fish and chips here and loved the cole slaw."}
{"text":"I keep being brought back to this bar for social occasions and each time I'm disappointed. I really don't like this bar. Maybe it's the touristy crowd they get here which leads the staff to be mildly competent and poor on customer service. Hard telling. Should I expect less out of a mall bar? Yes! That's why they got two stars instead of one. Good job.   If things go well, I won't ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Wow. Ordered kam pao chicken. It tasted like ass. Horrible. Everything Overpriced. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Chumbabwamba - Tubthumping)  I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around  (Yelping the night away, Yelping the night away) I try a chicken dish, I try a some nachos I try the flatbread , I try a slider dish I sing the songs they play on the screens that remind me of the good times I sing the songs they play on the screens that remind me of the best times (Oh Bo Bites, Bo Bites, Bo Bites)  Thirsty Lion Pub & Grill is located on the far West side of Tempe Marketplace.  It's location is perfect from what I gather away from the movie going crowd and food court area.  Standing alone next to Kabuki; the restaurants is super spacious with a large patio with a fire pit.  Perfect for the cooler nights and not a bad idea for the warmer nights to just enjoy people watching.  No not like that Inspector Gadget; no stalking allowed!    I like coming to the Thirsty Lion during the late hours for HH.  They have a great selection of beers and the food is pretty damn good.  I love the nachos here!  Extra crispy with avocados, beans, and cheese.  Pretty basic, but they pile that stuff on like there's not tomorrow; eat up damn it!  They're bar nachos during HH is pretty awesome too.  They call them pub chips, or potato chips so they're extra thick and you're able to scoop up the bacon, cheese, onions, and tomatoes.  The saltiness and crunch goes well with a cold bitter tasting beer!  Yum on a warm night!  I'm not a fan of the flatbread or main entrees so I generally stick with the bar food and burgers, which again is on the HH menu and bar menu.    Overall, pretty chill ambience on a game-less night.  They rock out on music videos, that yes, reminds me of the good times and reminds me of the best times! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had heard some great things about the Thirsty Lion, and decided it was time to give it a try. Our family stopped in during Happy Hour and ordered a few things listed on their HH menu and well, from there the whole experience fell short of what I was expecting. Our server was friendly enough; we just didn't see her much after our initial introduction.  We ordered calamari, sliders, and pizza. The portions were smaller than expected on all three things. No silverware/napkins came with the food, so we had to hunt down an employee to ask for them. We asked for a side of ranch as well. Quite some time passed, so we started in on the food. Just as we were finishing up the last few bites, our server delivered the silverware and napkins, as well as an apology. Still no ranch.   The sliders were good. The pizza was just okay. My wife wasn't impressed with her calamari, noting that it lacked flavor.   It wasn't busy at the restaurant, so we were a little confused as to why our visit seemed so unorganized: lack of a server, no napkins or silverware, and a requested side of ranch that never came. We order similar items at their competitor the Yardhouse during their Happy Hour and never have any of the aforementioned issues. At this point, we don't have much incentive to return to the Thirsty Lion nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite to eat on a Saturday afternoon while shopping at fashion square. I didn't even know that there was a new restaurant here so it was fun to try something different.  I was not impressed when we first walked in. The hostess was so rude and would not look us in the eye or even respond to our request for a table.  She was acting like we were bothering her when we asked how log they had been open for. If it weren't for my family and I being so thirsty we probably would have walked out then.  Once we were seated however things were great.  Our waitress was awesome, and we ordered the Brussel sprout salad and the Mexican chicken salad.  Both were delicious and refreshing for lunch. They also were perfect size. Nothing crazy were you were stuck with leftovers, but enough so that we were full.  My sister ordered the caprese sandwich and said it was pretty good, nothing special.    Overall we had a good meal, but I would recommend the hostess be a little more friendly, first impressions are everything."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Mother's Day and was very pleased with food and service.  They had a special menu on Mother's Day and let me tell you their blood orange mimosa tasted sooooooo gooooood. I think they used freshly squeezed orange juice. (Or that's how I tasted...)  I ordered pizza from the mother's day special menu.  Roma Tomato, Spinach, Arugula & Feta Cheese Pizza. Oh the cheese on this pizza was so good, and quite filling. After eating about 2/3 of it, I was full.  Friendly service, our server was just pleasant. Nice surprise was a complimentary appetizer gift card and a piece of chocolate for mother's day. I thought it was such a nice gesture.  Now I have this coupon, I need to come back here again."}
{"text":"Was able to meet an old friend for lunch today. We ended up picking the Thirsty Lion at the Fashion Square. We were seated and instantly greeted by our server Michael. He was amazing and basically met our every need making for excellent friendly service; I tip my lady hat to you sir.   For starters we ordered the calamari. This dish was not for us, tho we were told many others adore it. Maybe we're not use to the fancy calamari, apparently we enjoy the poor mans version of fried and fried some more. It was a bit tough to chew, and pretty funky, of course we ate it all.   Michael suggested the smoked turkey club so I threw all caution to the wind and ordered that bad boy. Um it was amazing! It had pepper smoked turkey, maple wood bacon, a chipotle drizzle on some amazingly rustic soft and perfectly toasted bread.  (FYI I'm a bead person...I, love, bread.)  It came with a side of fries that were delish as well.  Ikr course I couldn't tell you what my friend ordered because I had my face buried in my own plate.   Overall it was a good leisurely catch up brunchy kinda meal with a beautiful friend; warm tummies and a warm heart. It was one of days you always remember and go back to in your head and smile.   We will always have the Thirsty Lion, oh yes we will."}
{"text":"Always great service. Delicious food. Great prices. Fabulous Happy Hour.  Been here several times for all the above and its warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion is a good bar/restaurant that has a nice variety of food and drinks.  They have menu specials and I have never really had a bad meal there.  It can get a little expensive at times, however happy hour is a good deal.  They do have kids menus available as well.  I have also been there mid-week for trivia which is always fun.  It is kind of loud inside so be prepared for that, however the dining room is upscale and very nice."}
{"text":"It is difficult to not compare the Tempe location to this new San Tan location, but one must keep in mind that Gilbert has a much more conservative population of diners ( uber conservative would be more accurate).  I think the smaller venue will ensure success for many years to come.  The food is great and the selection of brews and wines is considerable.  Forgive the Grand Opening  issues that always arise and enjoy a liberal dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible management!  The people here advertised plenty of seating for the World Cup games only to turn away people who arrived more than an hour and a half before the game.  They delete negative comments on their facebook page to save face but the truth is they have an uncoordinated front of house staff.  They advised people to go somewhere else but ended up having tables ten minutes before the games started.  Their explanation was that they couldn't do anything and had no idea how to seat anyone.  Avoid this place because of the management!"}
{"text":"This place is huge and cavernous and kind of reminds me of The Yard House. They have a great selection of beer on tap and I quenched my thirst repeatedly with the Lagunitas Czech-style Pilsner.  I didn't sample the food but the menu looks like a step above what you'd expect when you walk in. We were looked after by an Aussie bartender called Sean who was AWESOME. I was still sad that I had to come home from Australia so it was good to talk to an Aussie. Anyway he took great care of us and we had a really great time....probably too great of a time but that's what Advil is for."}
{"text":"Food was OK, nothing special at all. I got the Cubano sandwich and it was saturated in mustard, almost had to send it back, but the service was so slow I didn't dare. I paid an extra $3 to upgrade my side to onion rings - not worth it. Overall a poor food value but the service was deplorable."}
{"text":"Thanks to a Groupon, I decided to try Thirsty Lion.  This is another time when I wish Yelp had a 3.5 star rating.  It's a bit better than OK, but I'm not a fan yet.  I wanted to try something different, so had the Thai shrimp and green papaya salad.  The shrimp were perfectly done and the seasoning good, but the papaya had little to no taste.  Plus, I discovered I'm not a fan of fresh mint, which is certainly not the restaurant's fault.  I asked for their table bread to go with my salad, but they don't offer that.  Hmph.  So I ordered a side of flat bread seasoned with garlic and butter.  It was just that -- plain.    During the fall and winter this place is full up at night, so I do want to go back and try their happy hour offerings and other menu items I saw.  Thirsty Lion has a nice warm atmosphere and a large patio -- perfect for those cooler evenings."}
{"text":"Beer.  I love beer.  They have a pretty big selection and a pretty decent happy hour.  We tried a few items on the menu including the Scotch eggs!  Delicious!  I had a pretty amazing sandwich that was more than I could eat.    Everyone I was with really enjoyed their meals and their drinks.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Way too loud for anything but watching sports on the tele. Good luck having a conversation at a table. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting for work and grabbed lunch with a sales team I was with. The food was good, service was decent, my salad was alright but nothing to write home about. For an easy decent priced lunch I would come back."}
{"text":"4 of us went to try it at 5:50pm on Friday. The hostess said they were to busy to even let us in the front door. They had over 12 tables on the patio \"reserved\" but only 2 tables had customers at them. I guess they felt that it was better to see if all 12 parties would show up eventually, rather than seat a party of 4 that was ready to spend money. When we walked back by at 9:15pm, at least 9 tables were still empty. Your mission statement and your actions don't match up.   After reading many other comments, I realize that this is not a fluke but rather the way they operate. There are too many other choices out there to have to deal with your disorganization."}
{"text":"Only been here for happy hour but good selection of gastro pub food and decent wine selection (more of my thing these days unless it's a tequila"}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early dinner after sightseeing.  We sat in the bar and had some great appetizers.  We had calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and a flatbread.  The service was great and the food was very tasty.  And they had pear cider!!!"}
{"text":"Had a GREAT meal for date night prior to hitting Harkins Camelview.  The Thai Shrimp Salad was amazing and my partner had a soup which was also delicious.  Service was just right and attentive.  Gorgeous restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time and I'm surprised I have to say this. I've never seen this place in this condition of disarray. It's 11:15 and not even half full but there are a bunch of un-bused tables, amateur hour with the bar backs and some bar staff. But not one bit of paper in the men's room. Toilet paper, paper towels, anything. And while usually you can see at least one person of management, whomever they are they're a ghost tonight."}
{"text":"I've been here now twice for lunch and like this place.  The rueben and the blue cheese chicken sandwich are good.  When I sat at the bar my server was Jennifer and she was great."}
{"text":"This place is very good, I love the variety. Food is always top notch. I recommend starting with the bbq bacon shrimp and getting the ahi tun salad! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and had great service and food every time. Their seasonal menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Its a great place to get together with friends. The food is so good. They always have great music playing and sports on tv."}
{"text":"Hitting on all cylinders today w/my 1st visit to this location of TLGG. FABULOUS attitude from servers, lovely ambience, very nice & comfortable feel to the place. AND their happy hour is off-the-charts good, with a food selection that features, um, FRESH food!  That's right, really nice commitment to ingredients is evident here.  Had a $30 Groupon and even still, my bartender treated me like royalty.  Going back again, and again, etc....  :)"}
{"text":"Not too impressed here.  Sat at one of the bars on a Thursday night and had a Guinness, scotch egg, and Fish n' Chips.  The Guinness was good of course.  The scotch egg was actually scotch eggs (2 eggs cut in two, thus four pieces) and they were pretty good with a thin sausage layer.  The Fish n' Chips were weird and not very tasty with some bizarre IPA beer batter... making them dark/bitter/heavy.  Service was not attentive and there were not many people there."}
{"text":"Hate being seated at a high top without being asked first. Especially when there were open tables. Server was super nice and attentive. 5 stars for her. The rest of the servers look like zombies, no smiles. The food was bland and boring. I ordered the Cubano. Tasted like they got meat at a deli. The bread was bland and not grilled as stated on the menu. This is a place for drinks, not food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. They have quite a few gluten free options. Yesterday I had salmon over jasmine rice and it was cooked really well!  Tonight my husband and I are here. We started with bacon wrapped dates and bacon wrapped prawns. Both were really good, the dates especially. He had the salmon Caesar salad. I ate the salmon and risotto.  We shared a crewman brûlée for dessert.   Our waiter was great. He was super knowledgeable about the gluten free options."}
{"text":"Love this place but don't order the hummus appetizer- it presents beautifully but you get two tablespoons of very watery hummus . I told the server and they replaced it with another two tablespoons of watery hummus."}
{"text":"Gross. Done. Lousy food. Poor service."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot. I got the Turkey club sandwich and onion rings. Very large portion and was truly one of the best sandwiches I have had in a very long time. If in the Tempe/ASU area or shopping in Tempe Marketplace an excellent choice! 9.2 out of 10"}
{"text":"April and I were at Tempe market place and on a whim decided to enter Thirsty Lion (Cool name). We entered and noticed the place was packed. The hostess informed us the wait for a table would be approximately fifteen minutes. While waiting I noticed all the customers I saw appeared to be having a really good time. We waited about seven minutes and were escorted to our table. Our server, Alyssa was very nice and helpful. I asked Alyssa which ladies drink she recommended (beer isn't April's thing). Alyssa recommended the Pear Cranberry cooler (seasonal drink) $8.50. I had a sip then helped myself to several other sips, it was good. We shared the Chicken Penne and Gonzola cream $13.95 The dish was beautiful and delicious! For dessert we went with Alyssa's recommendation of the Caramel Apple Cheesecake $6.95 (Also seasonal). really delicious. We definitely recommend this place. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Located in Tempe, Az large mall.  Nice big place with lots of TV screens and big outside patio.  The interior is one humongous room, so really noisy, but energetic. Definitely fun for the younger crowd from nearby ASU.  Was in town fpr business, and only place in greater Phoenix i could find with a reservation between 4 and 9!!!!  Thats my fault for traveling on V-Day!!!  Food is supposed to be pub food, and they are trying to channel and English Pub feel, but the music is a bit loud for that comparison.  The menu is full of burgers, and only one true pub food, fish and chips.  Other than that, menu is traditional American.  Really nice beer selection, wine is weak (as you would expect in a pub, so I have no problem).  Food was good, but just ok.  Come here for the atmosphere and opportunity to meet someone fun.  Clearly better food is available in Phoenix/ Scottsdale.  Dinner, drinks, and dessert (with tip) was in the $50 per person range"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times to watch football.  The food is very good.  The service is excellent.  Adequate number of TVs strategically placed to be seen from many tables.  My only complaint is that one time we went in for lunch - sat down, and they were playing loud obnoxious music.  Some sort of raunchy rap music.  We left and have not been back."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, but understated at times for sure. Have to make sure to sit at the bar to get attention. Been here 4 times, my wife and I love the, seared ahi and sliders. The sushi is not bad for happy hours, beer is on point as well. Just wish they had better staffing so that we did not have to wait so long for our food and get waited on in the future!"}
{"text":"New to town Made a reservation  Showed up to n a Sunday night 20 people in the place 4 waitresses walking around no one had a clue Finally got seated at a high table in front of the bar 20 mins go by and no one even looks in our direction  Walked out"}
{"text":"A buddy and I go here for lunch once a month.  It is a great place, lots of sports on television, but with food that is far better than a typical sports bar.....plus the staff is extremely attractive....not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"Yum! We were pleasantly surprised by this place! Saturday night and although it is busy, there were still tables available. We made a reservation an hour prior through Open Table. Love Open Table... Plus it was one of the reasons/recommendations of the website. We figured we'd be waiting at least an hour elsewhere.   Blueberry mojito was sooo good. 52 beer selection. French dip and fries were really good. Husband loved the rueben. Awesome tender, sliced thinned meat and delicious. It was how Ruebens should be made. Cheddar mash potatoes were pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Excellent hand crafted cocktails,very knowledgeable and attentive bartenders who actually take pride in their mixology skills,Had the Brussels sprouts app and they were AMAZING and only 5 bucks at Happy Hour.Two bars,really comfy stools and enviroment.Highly recommend this spot if you want a fine cocktail made right,delicious App's and entrees in a classy comfertable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after what started off as a good experience turned incredibly lack luster.  I took my friend here last night for her b-day and wanted some grub and good craft beers. It was a busy Saturday night with a wait, so we opted to eat dinner at the bar top.  The food was mediocre and the service was rather good, at first.  After two beers I was feeling a little bloated and decided to end the night with a cocktail, trouble is our server disappeared.  I sat there with a noticeably empty glass for over ten minutes. I located our server in the corner singing and dancing and yucking it up with coworkers and then with one particular male customer (he must tip well).  Finally the other bartender came close to us but only made conversation with the male customer next to us; again I was still sitting there, glass completely empty.  Finally I decided it was enough and just put my card down to pay, and of course that took another 10 minutes of waiting around.  Look, I'm fine with the wait staff having a good time (in fact I encourage it), however this shouldn't come at the expense at the customer's experience.  I work in the service industry and expect a good experience; I won't be back here for awhile after last night."}
{"text":"If you call a sports bar a gastropub does that make it seem fancier?  Thirsty Lion is a bit of a mashup with standard sports bar food mixed in with some pub fare and some reasonably priced cocktails.  Burgers, salads, and calamari are pretty much what you would expect anywhere.  The fish and chips aren't exactly traditional but they were pretty good and they served them with malt vinegar."}
{"text":"Oh so good! Veggie options are my fave here: Veggie Burger or the Grilled Veggie Panini Great for lunch or to catch a game!!! Lost of drink options too and happy hour includes a good variety for everyone!"}
{"text":"Every time i go there the food and staff are amazing!! Past servers stop by my table an say hello, the food is always on point. However, i have had the great pleasure of Rodrigo being my server on multiple occasions. I hadn't been there in months and he remembered me and what i usually order.  He's always there when you need him and a pleasure to deal with. If you are familiar whit him and like his service he likes peanut butter cups :)"}
{"text":"First time checking it out, finally!  We had a party of 4 celebrating a bday. Got there for Happy Hour, score.  i was really really impressed with the Happy Hour food menu! Most places offer run of the mill finger foods but this place had some creative creations that I hadnt seen on any other HH menus.   My wife and I ended up ordering like 5 items off the HH menu! We love each one! Sliders=great, bacon wrapped prawns=great, korean pork sliders=great, potato cakes=amazing! The prices were spot on too! under $7 a item.   The drink/beer menu left me wanting more, thats for sure. As a craft beer drinker I found the options to be average collection of the crafts you see anywhere else, i.e Papago Orange Blossom, Four Peaks Peach, handful of IPA's. Nothing too unique really in my opinion. Beer price was average for a place like this I suppose, high.   Service was spectacular! Our waitress, Amanda, was funny and upbeat. She made some recommendations and we had a few laughs!  Overall I was pretty happy! Cant wait to try one of the burgers I saw on the menu, some good looking options on the full menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing bad to say.  Great food, fun atmosphere, and good selection of draft beer.  To top it off they were genius with the placement and coverings off their patios.  Had lunch outside in 105o and was very comfortable with the mister system and didnt feel like i was in a rain shower.   Service was good but not great.  Burger was cooked to perfection and their fries are awesome."}
{"text":"I love sitting outside by the fire pit...delicious food, fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came with my boyfriend on a Sunday. Not super busy. Tried the bordeaux cherry drop and the guy got some beer.  Onion rings were yummy.  Tried the Pub burger and the pepper Jack jalapeño.  Both were very good.  I will Def be back for the pub burger tho.  OMG!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in for a while so I thought lunch was in order. Met Johnsie,  a lovely and attractive bartender. She knew the menu and craft beer selection very well. Prices are very fair for the ambiance, food quality and beer selection. I had the  Pork Cubano sandwich and an IPA from Dragoon Brewing.  It was a great experience!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped in for dinner while we were out at the Tempe market place. Thirsty Thursday so they had great happy hour for drinks and appetizers. I wish I could remember our servers name because he was amazing. Young good looking guy, very friendly and quick and prompt service.   For an appetizer we got a mini pepperoni pizza that was on happy hour for $4.50. It's was so simple, hot, and so tasty. I got the southwest smoked chicken salad and my fiancé got the peppered bacon cheese burger. They were both super tasty and fresh. He loved the peppered bacon. Tons of pepper and lots of flavor. They also make their sauces homemade so the ranch and BBQ are amazing!   Overall a great experience between service, food, and price. Highly Recommend (:"}
{"text":"Ok. We ended up back at Thirsty Lion and this time we actually went in. The food was great! Our server Vanessa was awesome! There weren't many people there which may have a lot to do with why our experience was so much better this time. I'm sure we'll be back again. The bf loved his sandwich. He got the caprese chicken sandwich and I quote, \"This may be the best sandwich I've ever had\" I went with the enchilada stack. It was good but the smokey flavor had me confused. It was so smokey I thought it was like liquid smoke possibly. Nevertheless still good just know to pick something else next time."}
{"text":"I was very excited to learn that the Thirsty Lion serves late night food. I had been wanting to try their scotch eggs. Unfortunately,  their late night menu is limited.  My partner wasn't stoked on the fish and chips, I on the other hand really enjoyed my ship tacos, bacon wrapped figs and kale salad. Admittedly, where the server was very nice it did take a little long for us to get our check. This could have very well been due to the time of night and she may have been trying to tidy up before close. I'd like to go back and try the scotch eggs."}
{"text":"I ordered the French dip sandwich and it was amazing!! Our server was also very helpful and informative, the only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because it is very very noisy and they had their windows open making everyone in our group shiver during the meal."}
{"text":"Great food, casual atmosphere and good service. My husband had a great bison burger and I had a seasonal salad. Both were very yummy."}
{"text":"Friendly service our bartender was great and he put on the game we wanted rite away and tacos we had they were very good we also tried smoked chicken salad!!! Alex also loved the food and we will go back !!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, always packed and now they have some great seasonal/fall specials! I tried the shishito peppers, they were really good and the chipotle aioli was awesome. Will most definitely go again and again... Service was great both the times I was there."}
{"text":"Went there the first week it opened...it was jam packed and the service was sub-par.  Great happy hour specials and cold beer. I'm guessing the service will get better once everyone gets the hang of things."}
{"text":"We will not be coming back to the thirsty lion. We arrived and were told our wait would be about 35 minutes. Once it reached 45 minutes I went to check on our wait to see how much longer. I told the hostess that we've been waiting for almost an hour, to which she interrupted me and said \"it's been 40 minutes and I told you it would be 35\", then proceeded to tell me we still had 15 minutes left. We finally got seated 25 minutes later than we were told. When they seated us, it was next to a party of about 20 rowdy men who were blocking half of our table. We could only sit on one side because they were in the way. They kept leaning on our table and shoving each other into our table causing it to shake; not to mention they were so loud we had to practically yell just to hear each other. We didn't even stay to get our water; I've never received such poor service. We went next door to kings fish house and were seated in minutes with delicious food!!"}
{"text":"I have now gone twice (once with a party of 2 and once a party of 12) since the location has opened, and all I can say is that it is ok....  It certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a place to go, but I wouldn't refuse to go it a friend wanted to eat there.  My first visit had better overall service than the second.  We were seated right away both visits, but it took a while to be greeted by a server.  For my first visit, the server was trying a little too hard to upsell and that became annoying.  Otherwise, the service was good.  For the second visit, the server seemed to disappear a lot.  I had to get up to get my own utensils after the food was dropped off and the server was nowhere to be found.  Also, I had to ask for our bill.  Plates were cleared away after and I waited a good 10 minutes before asking the hostess for our bill.  When we got the bill the server set it on the table and told us to let her know if we needed the bill split and again was gone.  I again had to get up to ask for service.  The quality of the food was pretty average and the pricing was to be expected from a chain.  At least it provides another option..."}
{"text":"This special event was to launch to the Phoenix Rising Lager. Great happy hour menu special to the soccer aficionados that included ordering happy hour appetizer of the California Roll (8 pieces) and the Bacon Cheddar Potato Cakes (2). Both appetizers came out in under 10 minutes with a busy happy hour crowd that I might tasted wonderful and hit the spot with my lager pint beer. I wish I could have stayed longer but had other commitments."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of a friend, we tried this place last night (Friday night).  It was busy when we got there (about 6:15 pm) and were told that it would be about 25 minutes.  We were directed to go sit out by the fire pit if we wanted while we waited.  In about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio.  Our server, Joe (\"hey-guy\") was one of the best servers we've had in a long while!  He offered suggestions and we ended up with the NW Pub Burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the Kobe Beef Burger with fries.  Both were awesome and the Pub Burger is to die for!!!  During our meal, Rene (a manager) came over to ask how we were doing.  We told him we were first-timers.  He told us to save room for dessert and during that discussion, told us we should try them all!  I told him that if they were on the house, we'd be happy to and he could come join us.  Long story short...he sent over the cherry bread pudding (on the house) and it was fabuous!  We will be regulars and can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu.  Everyone was friendly and we had a 5-star experience, top to bottom!"}
{"text":"Food: the Shrimp Ceviche was beautiful and refreshing; wish it came with more! The pretzels with cheese dip were underwhelming... Butttt the Scallops w/ Kale and Rice was bomb af. Came out hot, well seasoned, and presentation was beautiful.   Prices: Acceptable.  Atmosphere: On top of it.  Service: Super. What can I say, our bartender was hot, he made our drinks strong, and was attentive and friendly as hell."}
{"text":"We booked with open table and it was a brilliant move.  There was a 2 hour wait when we arrived and walked right in.  So that was perfect.  The table was in the bar, which honestly was quite loud, but my server was amazing.  She was perky and efficient.  The menu is a bit schizophrenic with Asian and Irish on the same menu, but everything we have had there has been cooked perfectly and served quickly!  You can't ask more than that from a restaurant.  They have a great outdoor area with heaters, I clicked very loud, but that is just in the bar area.  We had dinner with friends there in the past and conversation was much more pleasant farther from the bar,   The margarita was WONDERFUL, BUT they served it in a beer glass.  I requested a martini glass with salt and they were spot on in accommodating my request."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to join a group for happy hour at The Thirsty Lion in Scottsdale, I didn't know what to expect, but boy oh boy what a feast!  Since it was happy hour, let's start with the drink, if any one knows me they know Moscow Mules are my go to drink but Thirsty Lion kicked up a notch with their Spicy Mule, Smirnoff Vodka, ginger beer, lime juice, simple syrup, lime wedge and freshly sliced jalapenos, oh man this drink was amazing! Loved it! If you don't like spicy things, stay away from the Spicy Mule, because those jalapenos, they get all infused in the drink, so dang good!  Now for the food:  Pulled Pork Sliders, Traditional Scotch Egg, Sautéed Brussels Sprouts,  Bacon Wrapped BBQ Prawns, Bacon Wrapped Dates, who doesn't love BACON!!!!     Pulled Pork Sliders were great and since it was up for the offering I tried a Scotch egg, a hardboiled egg wrapped in pork sausage lightly breaded & fried, can't say I would order them again, but not saying I didn't like them, it was a little bland for me, and honestly I'm not a fan of sausage (but love me some bacon!!). The bacon wrapped bbq prawns, oh my gosh! Yum!! oh and the sautéed Brussels sprouts, oh my! They were sautéed with pepper bacon, red onions, olive oil & Reggiano Cheese, these are the way Brussels Sprouts should always be! I was tickled pinked to see the bacon wrapped dates because I had been craving them!!  They were medjool dates stuffed with Gorgonzola cheese & almonds wrapped in maple pepper bacon, these guys are just heavenly!! I could make a dinner out of them. Ok not really, but you really should try them!   Happy to have tried Thirsty Lion out for Happy Hour, look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Some of us had to work this past Monday, but for my friends and I it was a short day at work and we were in the mood to go to the movies to catch the new James Bond flick, but we had about 1  1/2 hours to burn, so we headed on over to the Thirsty Loin Pub & Grill, what a cool place! Love the set up!  1st off let me tell you, on Mondays they run this special were it's a large pizza, 2 sodas & 2 movie tickets for $19.99,,,are you listening to this!!! Its dinner & a movie for under 20 bucks! Yea that makes Monday night date nights way easy baby!   We decided on the happy hour menu, and what a great little menu, you can try all types of things and barely hurt your wallet! Prices were from $3.95 to 5.95 with plenty of variety.  And I think their happy hour beer prices were $3.50 to 4 bucks and they had wine, well drinks & margaritas for 4 bucks too!   Ordered the Pub Chip Nachos, homemade potato chips, melted mix of cheese, bacon, onion, tomato & this chipotle aioli sauce, that sauce was great!  Loved it! Could eat chips in it all day!!   Look forward to coming back and trying out other dishes!"}
{"text":"Wonderful happy hour, excellent and cheerful service and the food is comforting and delicious!! This time we had the Pork sliders, which were absolutely perfect and the chicken tenders (do not be turned off by the dark breading, it's not burned and is so mouth watering wonderful!)"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports and get descent food. Big screen surround sound too. Brussel Sprouts and Quinoa with Grilled chicken good choice."}
{"text":"Came here for HH.  Sat in the middle of the room.  Can't get a server's attention to save your life!  If you flag another server, that server will try to find your server and you sit and wait."}
{"text":"Made reservations a week ago not realizing this place was the official viewing party place for the soccer team. Arrived early and were seated promptly. Steve was our waiter and highly recommend him. He didn't miss a beat. It was my daughter's birthday and he took great care of us. Their menu has a lot of variety and they do it well. I had a chicken stacked enchilada, my daughter had salmon and my husband had tacos.and a flight of beer. Don't forget to top off your dinner with a brownie dessert. Decadent! Yes a little loud, but it was a fun place. We will be back. And don't worry if the parking lot is crazy."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Service on the other hand not so much. We are actually still waiting for Priscilla to cash us out and we have been sitting here for almost 10 minutes. Not to mention our drinks are empty and we are thirsty. I'm sorry all we had was Coke and not alcohol. I wouldn't be so bothered by this but I am just sitting here watching her roll silverware. I understand we are probably your last table and you want to get out of here but we deserve to be treated just like everyone else. AND yes we are still waiting for you to come cash us out!! We spent good money here $120 to be exact. Very disappointed in service but food was excellent!! Veggie panini was to die for"}
{"text":"Good place. Music was good. Not too loud. Food options were great and there was great variety. Also, their bathroom setup was on point and makes them worthy of the five stars. They put a trash can and towel dispenser right by the door so you could use a towel to open the door. Well done. Our waitress (bless her heart) had to deal with 9 of us (one baby). She was great but the hostess we made reservations with a week ago didn't hit save apparently so our waitress got stuck with two large parties. At times it was a little slow but she was great all things considered. We are a lovely bunch so it's amazing she ever even wanted to come back to our table.  So, check this place out. Way above average \"bar food\" and a great location. I recommend going early. There was a wait at 5:30 tonight (Saturday in July)."}
{"text":"The BF and I have been here several times now...always on a Sunday afternoon.  We love the patio!  The BF loves that they have Alaskan amber, and their margaritas are quite good too!  We've only eaten appetizers, but all have been good!  Ashton has been our server the past couple of times, and she's just great!  I definitely recommend this place.  :-)"}
{"text":"We walked in tonight to a mostly empty bar. I've been to the location in Tempe Marketplace and always liked it so I thought this one would be the same. There was no one at the front so we sat ourselves at a high top near the bar. While we waited to be served, two other groups walked in and sat. All of us including the other two parties ended up walking out with being served or acknowledged."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, good beer selection. We come often."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go when you can't quite decide what to eat. They have a good menu with things that you don't find just anywhere. Just check out some of the photos and you'll see. Great beer selection. Great place to people watch. Good service and fun."}
{"text":"Awesome! I enjoyed a margarita & some appetizers. Spinach dip w/chips & 2 pulled pork sliders. YUM! It could've been better if the serving size was bigger, but hey! they were appetizers.  Friendly service & nice patio seating, next to a firepit, lovely."}
{"text":"Huge pub. Ordered some beers and food. The food came out first. My wife and I decided to split Shephards Pie and Potato Cheddar Cakes. Thought the Shephards Pie was over priced at $14.95 for what we got. It was not made with dough around it. Potatoes on top with cheddar cheese, minced meat, peas and carrots. Tasted good but not enough. The Potato Cheddar Cakes were very good. Our waiter was not around very much. Loved the large monitors. Both music videos and March madness was entertaining us. I told the waiter how we felt about the pie, he apologized and threw in a dessert. The manager stopped by Jeff, and asked how everything was. I told him, he was very recepetive."}
{"text":"Quite the different experience here than dining at the one in Tempe. Spend the time and gas and drive to the Tempe location. We arrived at 4:30 in hopes of grabbing a table for some happy hour beers and snacks and then roll into dinner. There were 3 open tables on the east patio and 6 open tables on the north patio.  Inside was packed and the outside hostess said it was an hour wait. We wandered around the mall for 50 minutes and then got the text that our table was ready. At that point the outside hostess was saying it was a 2 hour wait for a table and turning people away who just wanted to go in and sit/stand at the bar. One gentleman said he just wanted to get to the bar and grab a beer...the hostess wouldn't let him in. That's crazy!  We sat outside and the entire time there was 5 to 6 open tables just sitting there with nobody seated. This was the situation until we left at 7:15.   Our server was pretty good right up until we were ready to pay.  She completely ignored us for 15 minutes when we were trying to pay and when we jumped up and down to get her attention she acted shocked that we wanted the bill. She only had 1 other table (a large party of 12 but they were eating and pretty much ok at that point). She brought the bill without an itemized bill and we just paid and bolted.   Can't say as if I would recommend the place based on the poor service. The beer selection is not as good as the Tempe location and if they turn people away at such a high rate they won't get a broad fan base. The food tasted good but I can get good tasting food at every restaurant there.   If you have to check it out, maybe try the Tempe location or go to a other restaurant nearby. You'll be frustrated at this spot.   UPDATE:  We have been back three times since then and they have been much better. The service has improved by leaps and bounds!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday afternoon. Stumbled upon it through the Groupon they were offering. Everything we had was great. Started with seared ahi tuna which was cooked to perfection abs had a trio of nice sauces to compliment the flavor, and the sesame garlic edamame which was also very good. For lunch I had the tavern burger with fries. Cooked to perfection and had a nice Chipotle aoli. My gf had the French dip which she said was amazing.  Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Great salads. The spinach and artichoke dip is the best I have ever had! Love their grapefruit basil martini!"}
{"text":"I met some of my friends here for cocktails and ordered a mojito. My drink was all ice and gone within two drinks.  I complained to the bartender and his response was \"oh there was some liquid in there, I can see it at the bottom.\" I ordered the ceviche from their summer menu. It came in a tiny cup that was filled half way with lettuce at the bottom and a huge tray of chips. The restaurant is popular for its ambiance and location, but I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I am only a fan of the Monday special that they have and their Pizza. I Absolutely love love love their pizza.  I cannot get enough!  So if we go out to eat we will only come here on Mondays."}
{"text":"The food was really good for bar food . I had the salmon. Jim had mac and cheese with an artichoke app and locally brewed beer. Several TV so we could watch the Kentucky derby."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not good.   barely acceptable food menu. Always loud and dark., Good beers and friendly waitresses. A little overpriced, but if you want cheap booze, Mill is a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports! Good food, great beer selection and plenty of TV's. Had a good time watching my team play. The manager went around the room asking what game we wanted to watch and we could watch our game."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, not great but definitely good! The French fries are nice and crispy. The pizza could have been a little crispier, but still good. The food selection was sort of similar to San Tan Brewery. The Amber beer was crisp and refreshing. I like how they text you when your table is ready, so you can walk around the mall. The hostesses were nice, and our server was nice. Don't think she told us her name though. She had brown hair and pink braces. The owner should consider giving out military discounts. Will probably end up going back to try some more items."}
{"text":"The place and location is excellent. Food is delicious. The server not so good. I requested dressing on the side and it was not on the side, I requested burger with no cheese and it came with cheese. Very poor service."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and I love it!  We had bacon wrapped prawns and edamame for appetizers.  I ordered the grilled salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes....delicious!    The waitress had excellent service and even surprised me with a free birthday cake.  Now that's customer service!  We saw an amazing college basketball game on their flat screens.  What an upset  when Villanova beat North Carolina for the championship!  I highly recommend and will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love this place for happy hour from 3-6 everyday of the week and weekends! Perfect for watching games or sitting outside when the weather is nice. Huge drink selection from specialty drinks, beer, wine, and cocktails! The menu selection has a wide array of options to choose from, appetizers, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, fish, steaks, specialty dinners and more. This restaurant is obviously a chain but the ambiance inside is really what makes this place. The staff and service is always good and they do a good job at getting you seated quickly. My personal favorites are the hummus and flat bread appetizer, Baja fish tacos, and gastropub burger!"}
{"text":"We were a starving party of five. We were seated on the pub side of the room. There was one server he was also the bartender. We waited for drinks. We waited for water and then I left...too hungry to put up with terrible service   ...This is shit so far, I cannot make it through an entire meal. We asked for the check and left.  I asked for the manger. I told him, only One person,/bartender server...... Terrible service. A joke. We're never returning  Another crap corporate shit pub.  The manager sucks."}
{"text":"Food, service, cleanliness all incredible.  The Scotch eggs, burger and Paella were perfection.  Chefs Edward and Ricardo, Manager LK, and Server Rachel all knew their jobs and did everything right!  Thank you for a fantastic lunch.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely unprofessional. Went there to watch the game because it is a sports bar. Hey thirsty lion, you are not the Keg. If you don't want people cheering and being loud, don't show games."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and the food is always good. Tonight, I met up with a group of friends, and our food came out slowly, and a couple orders were not quite right. The manager was super nice and comped our whole meal. That is great customer service, and we will definitely keep coming here for happy hours and dinners!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING. The food was amazing and the service was great. Everyone there was super friendly and wanted you to be there. And the best part of all. The food was so good I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend pkace"}
{"text":"I guess this is good for some folks but not me. It's VERY snooty. Very fancy. Classy lady wearing an expensive dress greeted me upon entering. I think I was a bit underdressed judging from the frowning, disappointing look on her face. Met with some other friends of mine, who were all there to watch a game. Idk, I want thrilled. Was very big, loud, & busy. More of a social scene, a place to been seen by the bougie crowd.  But the food was good. And the overworked and stressed waitresses did a good job of keeping on top of literally hundreds of diners packed in there.  Idk, next time I wanna watch a game, imma take my crew to a dive bar which is way more comfortable."}
{"text":"I don't normally like to leave bad reviews but we came here early on a Tuesday afternoon.   Service was very slow and food was fair and overpriced.   I got the fresh squeezed margarita that was not very good, my hubby got a burger that was good.  I got the Cobb salad...chicken was dry and for the price not very big.   Far better places to choose from in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Soooo impressed by this restaurant. Last night we wanted to go to San Tan Mall area to try a new place for dinner. I'm so glad we came here. The food was amazing! We had the bbq prawns that come with coleslaw (which I normally don't like) but I loved it! The fish tacos were also delicious, very flavorful. My favorite thing was the blood orange margarita. Our server Delaina was great, never had empty drinks and she was always checking on us. We also met one of the assistant managers who was really nice. The atmosphere is fun and cool, which is important to me...high ceilings with neat lights and a great patio area. We will be back soon and recommended this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here last Friday to celebrate Father's Day and my birthday with my husband and in laws. The service was great and food was delicious. I ordered the pork carnitas salad bowl off of the seasonal menu. It was so fresh and yummy, lots of different ingredients and the pork was amazing! I thought it was really sweet that they brought out this nice dessert - huge portion of ice cream with fudge and candied nuts. Everything was lovely, we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Used to be a huge fan, any other ordinary \"bar food\" type restaurant, decent beer, happy hour and food, but when a waitress who strives off tips openly flirts with and then becomes engaged in an affair with a married man? I have lost all respect. It only takes one sour experience to turn a place into something that is unenjoyable and will be shared. Professionalism and character is out the door with this place."}
{"text":"Waitress was really nice, we were sat quickly but their late night menu is not good at all. we ordered the calamari and the pear flatbread and was not impressed at all. The calamari was way over salted. And the flatbread didn't even have any pear on it. Should have stuck with take out pizza. Seriously steer clear if u are hungry past 10 pm"}
{"text":"We had reservations for the patio - we ordered happy hour appetizers and the portions were very small-we asked for more chips which they did not want to give us - the portions were so small for the price we paid - usually a 12$ salad is pretty filling - but not here - stingy on the chicken - not sure we will be back - felt like a waste of good money -"}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant at San Tan Village mall (late lunch, 2pm)... Had a bahn mi sandwich with fries. So yummy!! Taking 1 star away since the sandwich is only a winter special. It needs to be available all the time! *Keep in mind. This location is at a MALL. This mall has crappy parking and is busy. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Whenever we have gone there service and getting the food out is always very slow. This time extremely slow!!! The manager made it right though, he came over to our table and talked with us and apologized how long it was taking. And then comped us our appetizers and desserts as well as giving us coupons for free appetizers next time! He was so great and went out of his way to make things right!"}
{"text":"Great location. Food is very good. Service is very good. Lots of games on and nice scenery."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times as of this review. Darcie and I stopped by today following a Wonder Woman matinée at Fat Cats.   The place has a pleasant tavern atmosphere with attentive, friendly staff, but falls dead-center on 3 stars due to lack luster food quality. My rating for Thirsty Lion includes a +1 for the atmosphere and staff. So, from a food-quality stand point, understand that you are walking into a 2 out of 5 establishment.  My analysis is that Thirsty Lion is trying to do too much and not doing particularly well at any of their offerings. Drop some of those other trades Jack; be a master of something!  Frustratingly. a lot of restaurants are falling into this category. I'm so weary of the food-service clamor to bludgeon the customer with Gourmet This and Gourmet That. Oh Arugula. Aaah Brioche. Yeeee Aioli. Reindeer goat-cheese pizza! (Hudson Hawk reference there.) It just makes me want to roundhouse the next bearded hipster I see, stand over him, and yell: \"See what you have done!\" But I digress.  It's not that the food is bad, there's just nothing that distinguishes it above something you can get from a drive through, except that you can get a glass of beer or wine.  I've been all over the menu. At one time they had a Bánh Mì sandwich. Oh, it was dry and awful. I've had the fish and chips, sub par. The pizza is bland. The burgers aren't worth the expense, the meat has little flavor, and yikes, Way Way Way too much bun. Today my wife and I shared a Tavern Burger. No noteworthy difference.  The one item that had kept me coming back, the Hand-Breaded Chicken Tenderloins, has been consistently overcooked on my last 3 visits. Note to kitchen: the tenderloins should be golden brown. Not golden brown with splotches of very dark brown. You guys are cooking them 45-60 seconds too long. On today's visit, they were only slightly over cooked, but this go-round they were also under seasoned and tasteless. I don't think they were salted coming out of the fryer. On my 2nd to last visit I refused the order because it was very noticeably overcooked. I remarked to the server on the darkness of the tenders. He tried to explain that they just come that way. I countered that they didn't used to. I cut into a piece and showed him a dry cross section. He got us another order. It came the exact same way. I did a repeat performance of my show and tell with the manager. He took the tenderloins off our bill. {sigh} Please bring back the tenderloin tastiness.   Enjoy the customer service and the atmosphere, watch a game, have a beer or glass of wine. Don't expect much else.  As for us, I think we are going to give Thirsty Lion an extended break, probably 6 months or so.  If you are looking for a good burger, far better options are:  *  Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers (awesome variety done right)  *  Liberty Market (best tasting ground beef in the state - bar none)  *  The Chuckbox (for that low-cost, ASU-nostalgic, mesquite grilled tastiness)   If you are looking for chicken tenders, just head to Canes."}
{"text":"Wow--- never been to a restaurant that dropped stars from me and my wife so rapidly. We so wanted to love this place. The decor is cool. The menu is fresh. They have a cool Monday pizza and movie special. We literally were in a conversation about how awesome the changes from Maria Maria's. And how we could come back with some friends. Seriously, we were planning our next visit.  Then the food came. I don't know if it was any good to be honest.   I was so freaking grossed out by what happened just before.  I asked a server for a spare dish. I saw her pick up one, make a funny look when she looked at it and then she grabbed another. After she placed it down, I went to move it toward me and my thumb squished into maybe 3/4 of an inch of a slimy mass stuck to the underside of the plate. I turned it over and it was a blackish something larger than the diameter of a smashed orange and nasty. I was skeeved out. I went to wash my hands immediately. Yuck.   I stopped to tell the hostess on the way back to the table. She sent the manager over. Our server came over as I was letting the manager know that I was really disturbed by the experience. Our server said \"oh, it was just lettuce\" as if I was the a-hole for even mentioning it. The manager said the only words I will probably ever hear from him as I will likely not be back--- \"So, we good?\"   I mentioned to the server after she came back that I did not think it was lettuce... she argued a bit with me. Maybe it was lettuce. Maybe it was some other rotting mass on my dinner plate. I don't know.   It bothered me. It bothered my wife. Trust me, it was pretty gross. We nibbled around the food-- I didn't honestly much interest it. Maybe I am squeamish. Maybe I was being a bit of baby. I don't think so.   Easily the meal should have been comped at worst, my concerns not marginalized. Instead, we paid the full amount for the meal. Tipped and left with food that hopefully will reheat when my appetite has returned.   I've written this review not as vengeance piece, but in the hopes that the staff can maybe adjust up and respond to awkward situations more professionally.   So, we good?"}
{"text":"Located in the Tempe Marketplace Mall, this restaurant is a favorite place for me to meet someone for lunch.  Because it's situated just off the 101 and 202 freeways, it's very convenient for meeting someone halfway between 2 distant cities in the Phoenix area.  I've setup lunch meetings and happy hour get togethers here....it seems to work well for us.  I've tried the following menu items:  Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger - $11.50 Sliders - $8.95 Ultimate Nachos - $9.95  Out of the group, my favs are the Nachos and the Cheeseburger.  The Nachos are pretty large and can easily feed 2 people....although I took care of them by myself, ha!  The Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger is full of flavor and the spice from the Pepper on the Bacon compliments the juicy Burger very well.  The Sliders are pretty good as well.  It's a good lunchtime option.  There's plenty of parking at the mall and it's conveniently located at the West end of the mall, so you don't have to walk around too much to get there.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"TEMPE, AZ: (Drinks Only) Came here with business associates.  The vibe is fun, they have lots of TVs and it feels like a nice unwind spot.  Tried the Mojito and it was awesome!  (I even ordered it virgin).  The food looked pretty good.  I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking forward to checking out this place since we live in Gilbert and enjoy having local places to go. We were NOT impressed and these are the reasons why: The atmosphere was nothing special - loud and busy, no interesting decor, very few TV's. For only being open for three days, they were greatly understaffed and the general feeling of the staff was of confusion. The servers were more frazzled than friendly. Our drinks came out slow and our food came out slower. We first ordered a creamy artichoke dip with chips. They gave us about ten chips with two tablespoons of lukewarm dip. For the meal, we both had the Fish & Chips. The Fish pieces were a nice size but the batter was greasy. The fries were awful - chewy, and tasted like they were a day old and had been re-fried. Half of my (not too generous of a portion) of fries looked to be from the 'bottom of the barrel' - they were nearly burnt. This place is not ready to be in business. We have no plans to go back and will not be recommending Thirsty Lion to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The bar put an ice cube in a shot glass, does that make any sense? I made a reservation and the hostess was so pretentious. You're not cursing cancer here people. Your serving overpriced drinks and food in a hipster environment. Service was slow as I mentioned. We waited a long time for everything- beers, food etc. Then I saw a bunch of waitresses putting on make up in the bathroom. No wonder all of the food was late or didn't come out all together."}
{"text":"I love this new location and the service is so much better than the Tempe Marketplace.  There is no comparison the staff was super friendly and very attentive got our drink orders right away sat us immediately didn't have to fight the \"reserve\" seating section.  Great brews on draft our server knew what was on tap she knew the happy hour menu and suggested a few of her favorite items.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"POO!  I would think after my last review this place would get their S#it together!  We came here for a birthday event in mid-day Saturday.  No ball game, no derby, nothing was really going on sports wise...so you would think service would be better.    I want this place to succeed!  It's a great location, the concept is fantastic, man...the service was still horrible.  The waitress at this establishment are ......hmmmmm -trying to think of something nice.  CLUELESS.   The waitresses here are cute, overwhelmed, clueless, can't remember anything.    I would suggest just go to the bar and order everything.  More than likely you'll get what you want, your tab will correct and your food order maybe correct.  Still not impressed."}
{"text":"First time visit on the way to a concert. We needed somewhere decent and conveniently located for lunch so we decided to give this place a try.  And I am really glad we did. wow was it good.  The restaurant itself is spacious and tables are placed with wide margins of distance between them. \"Crowded\" is the last word anyone would use to describe this place, even if every table was occupied. I like that very much.  The waitress was attentive and did a good job, but the food was what really surprised us. The Tavern burger exceeded my expectations, and the bacon-wrapped prawns appetizer isn't cheap, but the experience is religious.  Wasn't terribly excited by their specials so I had iced tea to drink, but the prices weren't too out of line. Easy 4 stars. Would like to return sometime at night and enjoy their very attractive semi-outdoor bar."}
{"text":"Visiting and found the restaurants while walking  around the Tempe Marketplace Friday early evening. Service was fine,  did not like the ice tea as it was very citrusy,  club sandwich was good, but it was horribly noisy.  I was glad I was by myself as I wouldn't have been able to hear anyone else.  If I did go back I would try lunch hoping for a bit less noise and chaos."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for lunch or dinner when I have a shopping day at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Always consistently good food and great drinks.   The past three times I have been to Thirsty Lion I've ordered the Smoked Turkey Club, it's so good and made panini style. I'll probably order it again next time. I do the side it is served with, I had a small side salad this time, but I have also had their fries and cole slaw. All are great!   Drinks are very good. I had two different martinis, a traditional gin to take the edge off from holiday shopping and then a pear martini for dessert.   It's a pretty large place and is really well done.  Also very comfortable. Even the bar stools are comfortable! There is an \"inside patio\" for people watching but there is also a regular patio off the bar as well.   Check out Thirsty Lion during your next trip to Fashion Square.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Monday Nov. 26 , 2012 happy hour 3pm.  We shared the fried calamari with tarter dipping sauce we both like it although I would have wanted tentacles and rings together no tentacles in this dish it was good.  Also ate the cheddar green onion fried potato cakes nice presentation but this batch lacked seasoning not much cheese flavor next time we will order the sauce for this appetizer on the side and get a real taste of what these potato cakes bring to the table.  The roma pizza well the outer crust of the pizza was cooked nice and a little crunchy but the center of it was very wet from the juices from the roma tomatoes not as sexy as I thought this pizza would be just too soggy.  Kiltlifter beer was cold the service was excellent I had a feeling the staff has been through customer service training.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Was looking for an upscale place to settle in and enjoy dinner, and was not disappointed! For as nice as this place is, the prices are fair and the drinks are great. Tasty beer on tap and kind wait staff.  I got the crusted chicken and veggies with pasta and it was absolutely phenomenal! And their selection of beer on draft is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. They opened the door for us as we walked in, seated immediately, ordered drinks, they let us taste a few different beers for no charge, ordered food and it arrived incredibly fast! Ahi Tuna Salas is delicious! Slight kick to it for the sauce on the tuna, ask for it on the side if you're uncertain. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Decided to sit down and have lunch and a drink at The Thirsty Lion before shopping at Fashion Square- the service was nothing more disappointing on a Saturday afternoon at 4pm, barely dinner time. Upon arrival the hostess said he would be back with some waters. 5 minutes past and a lady comes to our table and tells us, \"I'm not your server but I will take your order because your server is currently backed up\", keep in mind, still no waters. We tell her our orders having ordered 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an entree. A man (manager) comes up to our table 10 minutes later and delivers the appetizers and drinks. We asked for a side of plates and another set of silverware since there was only 1 on the table and he says he will be back with them. My friend gets upset and goes inside to find someone who can get us some plates and silverware being we are starving and having no plates to eat with, also 10 minutes had passed! Our server asks if we want the entree cut in half and my friend says no. 1 second later the man behind him brings the entree. (What is the point in asking when the food is already here????) no one comes to check on us after the food arrives. The fries that came with the entree were the leftover pieces that you can tell were old. The food was cold."}
{"text":"First impression walking in was all the female waitresses had very short skirts or dresses. Other wise clean. When we sat down to look at the menu we realized how pricey things were here... I had the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad which ended up being Spicer than I had hoped for. My friend had the French dip which was very bland. She also wasn't offered more Ketchup with her fries (little I know but it's the small things). When we were nearly finished with our meal (by finished we both had many left over) the waiter finally asked how things were, to which I replied, \"It was ok.\" The waiter seemed pleased with this response filled my friend's water but not mine. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is excellent for a chain restaurant. Service is sub par. We were greeted immediately by the Hostess and seated in a half full restaurant. Someone else was seated immediately after us and the waitress immediately greeted them and took there drink order. Our waitress took 5-10 minutes to get to our table. While she was nice and knowledgeable with the menu she was just very slow to do anything. Our drink orders took 12+ minutes to get to us both times we ordered drinks. Food came out in a timely manner. I had the bacon Mac and cheese and the wife had a burger. Like I said food was excellent service not so. You can do much better in Fashion Square Mall. Check out Kona Grill or Yard House for better service and great food."}
{"text":"My manfriend and I, an interracial couple, asked to be seated outside. No one came to our table for 15 minutes. We went back to the hostess station and asked for a manager. He blamed the hostess for not telling servers there was an outdoor table. We asked why they would seat people outdoors if they would not assist them. He made a vague gesture to compensate but we told him we would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.    Went in today.  There was no hostess nor any sign to wait to be seated, so I sat at an open table.   Not so much as a nod from any of the staff.  After 10 minutes I left.  Exceptional lack of customer service and I'll not return here."}
{"text":"I once came here for my friend's bday dinner and got excited when checking out their beer menu. If you like beer like me, then you may get giddy. It kinda reminds me of a lesser known Yardhouse. It's got a huge beer menu and also an equally lengthy food menu (which I think can be a downside sometimes).   Anyhoo, this place is huge with a decent size bar in the center and decorations that make it look like a futbol/soccer pub. They also got big screen LCD TVs all around the bar to watch sports, but if you're sitting at the dining area, you may not get a good glimpse of it depending on location.   The service was good and we had some happy hour menu items which seemed to consist of the usual HH items like nachos, calamari, small pizzas, etc. (you know what I mean) As for the main course, I had the kobe beef burger which was ok. I felt like it could have been spiced up a little bit with a different cheese or toppings, but oh well. Maybe i'll try another dish next time and see.   The HH prices were quite decent, but main entrees can get pretty pricey for a pub and grill sorta place."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite in the East Valley!  Great beer selection, great food (not just pub food either) and great looking staff make this place a \"must visit\"!"}
{"text":"Here is the deal, this place is fantastic! Been a regular here for quite some time    Just couldn't get enough! You want to close deals ? Bring your customers here! I have noticed business meetings play a major role at this location! Very central and the staff and food is amazing! I don't get the chance often but when I sit at the bar, Joncie is always smiling ready to take care of you! She is on top of it.  Perfect lunch time place ! Couldn't be happier ! Highly recommend garlic sesame edamame! It's the best in town and that's no joke!"}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion never disappoints! With daily HH, Boddington's cream Ale on nitro tap, and its spacious and British vibe we love stopping by.  It's an anchor restaurant for the Scottsdale Fashion square so it can get a bit crowded at times but we've never had a problem finding a seat at one of their two bars or many high tops.  We enjoy the appetizers like the sweet and spicy, chili garlic edamame, the kale salad and the salmon cakes. They also have some really good flat breads and sliders as well.    A 4 star, \"one of our favs for HH\" review."}
{"text":"A great place to have a burger before going into the movie theatre at Tempe Market place or just to go and eat. Everyone's nice and they get your orders pretty fast."}
{"text":"I had a chicken ceasar and a beer here and wasn't all that impressed.  For the price of the salad I was expecting more.  The chicken was very dry however still seasoned nicely. Service was mediocre, but it was a relatively busy Saturday. I would go back for a beer with the guys but would skip the food."}
{"text":"Love the food! I have been to the one in Tempe and it's awesome as well. This new location is bigger and has an awesome patio... Especially at night. Love the beers on tap and the service has always been excellent!"}
{"text":"Very nice, clean and great atmosphere. Service is friendly and quick. Fun for a date, groups and families. Food is made to my liking and very tasty and affordable. It's set in a great location where can meet and greet friendly customers as well."}
{"text":"It was good, but it's really a bar to watch whatever game is on. We went at night, but inside it was REALLY dark, the only light was from the big screen TV's around the bar and hanging down by other tables and dimly lit yellow lamps that were littered about... we asked to be seated outside because there was a little more lighting out there. But you could really tell that outside was a more intimate setting for date night, or groups that want a more intimate setting? Not gonna lie, it felt awkward sitting among couples in the patio haha!  Our waiter was great though, he was attentive, and the food was alright."}
{"text":"Took awhile before we saw a server. GM Tim Mace was made aware of the situation and did an outstanding job to correct. Food is always outstanding here and this was no exception.  So few places these days know how to give truly great customer service after the drop the ball Tims crew here is the exception. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"The food was solid, and the customer service was even better. I will definitely come back here if I'm ever back in the area"}
{"text":"Great food and great beer selection. I can give it that fifth star after I check out the bathroom and eat inside. The patio was cooled ceiling fans and misters. They had Mirror Pond on tap - one of my favorites! I ordered a Salmon dish that included leaks and asparagus. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food that came out quickly and the service was very friendly. Clean and neat decor. Will definately come back!"}
{"text":"This place we just walked in to at the Fashion Square mall. Amazing food and drinks. The bar staff were friendly and recommend some good eats. Had the rueban and fried green beans while watching football. Jist visiting Scottsdale but definaly will be back here!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Loved the Brussel sprouts! Fantastic calamari and chicken sandwich to die for! Best of all- Excellent service Angela S.!"}
{"text":"We only came here because four peaks was open but the kitchen was closed and we all were hungry. My brother-in-law's drink. My fiancé and I don't so I can't really talk about the types of beer they have here. But all I know is they had some local beer. As for food it was OK or late night happy hour food. We ordered the fried green beans.. Which were actually really tasty Brother-in-law's order the mac & cheese which she said was amazing and a cheeseburger which was pretty good too My fiancé and I ordered the three cheese pepperoni pizza. I wasnt a big fan of it it was pretty soggy in the center from New Jersey so I'm already snotty about pizza..  But can't complain it was 10:30 at night late night food."}
{"text":"We are fans of The Thirsty Lion.  The place is always clean and comfortable.  The prices not too bad. The tunes, good.  The menu has a bit of everything, from salads and comfort foods, to the late night apps menu of sushi and other goodness. The cocktails are made well, and your glass, no matter what the beverage, never sits empty.  The staff is very friendly and has obviously been trained that customer service is key. The music can be a bit loud at times,  but it IS a pub, and exudes the pub - friendly, sports-oriented atmosphere. It is also family friendly and is never rowdy, minus the dude at the bar who yells for every flag, foul or touchdown!  Give The Lion a try...or order ahead and bring it home!"}
{"text":"First time here awesome service and food! Seated quickly on a Friday night. Got our drinks and food really fast and there were 5 of us. Everyone got a different menu item and they all tasted great! The manger came to our table when we were done with our meal and chatted for a minute. Definitely  recommend this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"Great food but a little disappointed.  My plate had a weird spot of something red on it.  Rather than cause a scene I allowed the manager to decide what he thought would be acceptable to make it right.  So he apologized.  Maybe my approach was off.  Not that I wanted my meal comp'd but it would have been a nice surprise to see a little something taken off.  The service otherwise was good and the server was great."}
{"text":"The bacon on the Gastropub Burger was like eating candy!!! So delicious. The salty and the sweaty fade for a great meal. The drinks were spot on and the service was stellar! Thank you to our waitress, Amanda!!!"}
{"text":"This place is my JAM. Both my wife and I's Jam, actually. This place has everything. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, entrees, deserts, beer and cocktails.   It is bar food at its best and most elevated at a reasonable price. Want to go to Chili's? Think again--- think Thirsty Lion. Want to get some great brewskies at a great price? Thirsty Lion. Want a place where you want to watch the game and enjoy great ambiance with friends or clients? Thirsty. Fucking. Lion.   Also, they have the BEST spinach artichoke dip. E-VER.   James out."}
{"text":"It is a solid 3.5.  But I rounded up because service was good, place felt clean.  I had the spinach artichoke dip w some flatbread. That was really good. I was expecting nachos. Couldn't finish it all because it was filling. Then got the spicy tuna roll appetizer as a meal.  This was tasty although prepared differently. The tuna is solid.  The rice was like the prepackaged sushi you get at grocery store.  Still pretty good. My surprise was that lunch for 2 with one appetizer and no alcohol was $36 plus $7 for tip.  Place was busy but not crazy...guess people don't mind spending that much. I'll go again..."}
{"text":"We came in for a birthday party, large group and some difficult orders. Our server was Dani and she took amazing care of us! We would definitely come back, and we will ask to sit in her section!"}
{"text":"We ordered pretzels, salmon crab cakes and spinach artichoke dip.  Sorry forgot to post pictures of these. But didn't forget entree pictures!  Shrimp tacos, chicken Waldorf salad and grilled salmon sub green beans for asparagus. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks were on the small side, but tasted fine.  I ordered just a little flatbread (pear and arugula, IIRC)and enjoyed it.  The coworker I was with ordered a chicken sandwich and said it was good. The restaurant was nice, and the prices weren't unreasonable.  I just didn't get excited by this place, and would try many other places before coming back, even though there's nothing in particular I didn't like."}
{"text":"All the charm of Applebees, but without the same high bar for Customer Service.  If you can get a drink in less than thirty minutes in this joint, you're doing better than we did."}
{"text":"I like this place but they need to monitor their hostesses.on two separate visits young girls were manning the hostess station and both times not inviting. A hello would be nice.   Actually, have been here 3 times. One for drinks and appetizers with friends, one for dinner and once for happy hour. Food is good and so is the service. It's in a great location. Plenty of tv's and seating. Has a nice vibe"}
{"text":"Colton was the best server and he gave us the best advice on what to chose for our apps and meals. He did not disappoint. The food was sooo good! And our drinks were always refilled. Thanks Colton!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had a great time at this location. The wait time was a big long but it was also 4:30pm on a Friday night. We waited for about 40 minutes but once we were seated it was smooth sailing. We hit up the $4 well drinks and tried some specialty cocktails as well (raspberry mojito, YUM). I had the California roll and pretzel. Pretzel was a bit dry and bland but the California roll was good.   Our waiter, Michael, was the best thing about this location. He was extremely friendly and even though he was busy, he always made sure we had full drinks and were content. We'd come back just for his service. Overall, this is a great attraction for San Tan."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Not only is all the food amazing, it always comes out exactly how I order it. The staff are all extremely helpful and the manager Jeff is very nice. I would definitely recommend going here to anyone looking for a good meal and great service."}
{"text":"We loved the thirsty lion! My boyfriend and I didn't know what to expect since it was our first time here, but wow! Very good quality food and very friendly and accommodating staff. I'm impressed. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"A great addition to Tempe Marketplace, The Thirsty Lion provides a great atmosphere, a wonderful selection of beers on tap, and reasonable prices. Plus the food is pretty wonderful (and with a great happy hour, you can't go wrong here).   With an expansive selection of indoor seating, you can choose to sit at a high top, at the bar, or at a comfy table indoors. If you'd like to experience their outdoor seating, you won't be disappointed with the several fire pits and lovely chairs.  The service can be spotty (previously Maria-Maria, they're still a fairly new establishment) but the great atmosphere and food makes up for it. Moderately priced, it's well worth venturing in for a drink if it's cold outside."}
{"text":"The french dip is killer. I've never had a meal that wasn't delicious. Our servers have always been nice and helpful, even though it is a busy place so naturally it can be a little loud or take a while to get your food, but that's kind of expected considering its location and size. I like the atmosphere a lot, too. The only thing that drives me crazy is how a decent number of the tables have stools instead of chairs with backs. Maybe it's just me, but it's hard for me to relax if the chair doesn't have a back (unless I'm at the bar of course). Nice place, though."}
{"text":"Loud music and staff is inattentive. Nothing special with this place except for happy hour where you can get their good food for affordable price.Yum!"}
{"text":"Our first time at the Gilbert location.  Food wasn't that good, service was okay, and the prices were high for the quality, portion sizes, and service."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this location. I have been to the Tempe location a lot and just so happened to pop in here and gave it a try. Our server Sam was very attentive and suggested awesome appetizers ! Everything was reasonably priced. It's nice to see great service with the same quality in food. Thank you Sam! We will be back!"}
{"text":"sis and niece and I had lunch here yesterday.  Service was excellent; Kate was attentive, but backed off when we were talking, and waited to interrupt and do her waitron duties; glasses of Arnold Palmer were always refilled, stopped to see what we needed, etc,  I had the Fish and chips, because I am a HUGE fan of fish and chips, and these were excellent; crisp, fresh and firm cod, good tartar sauce, crispy fries and fresh coleslaw. We started with the Charcuterie platter -  Italian meats; sopressata, prosciutto, salami, chorizo,  paté, blue cheese, whole grain mustard, cornichon pickles, an excellent Fig Jam and Parmesan ciabatta crostini. Sis had a Tavern burger - big as a Venti - and she loved it; niece had French Dip, said it was Okay she's married to a chef and is a fine-tuned critic. I'll go back - I love good fish and chips and this was one of the Best"}
{"text":"Was a great place to go! Packed to the roof when we went! But service was awesome and the drinks were great! Fun atmosphere, and rowdy crowd when it came to the football game :) The Nachos were awesome too!"}
{"text":"I came in with my fam to enjoy their happy hour special for the first time and it was great. The happy hour had good variety at a good price. I would recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"I like this place!!!  Stopped in for a happy hour beer and shopping respite, and was sooooo pleasantly surprised.  The place looks great, The service was  above average, and very friendly and welcoming, The beer was cold, discounted and was givin many great choices. food well it was bliss. I had the potato cakes from the half off happy hour menu. These crispy spice cakes might be amungst the best appitizersin town! They are certainly better then any appitizer at Tempe Marketplace.  word on the street is good too!!! I cant wait to get back!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here before going to the movies on Fri night. Happy hour is until 6 & a really good deal. House wine is $4 & beers are $4.75. My boyfriend & I split: -Caesar Salad ($3.95) - my boyfriend said it was pretty good but he tried my kale salad and wish he had gotten that -Kale Salad ($4.95) - delicious!!! and perfect amount for a side salad -Pulled Pork Sliders ($4.95) - really good -Hand Cut Pub Fries ($3.95) - good! -Pepperoni & Four Cheese Pizza ($4.95) - personal size, perfect for splitting since we got all of the other stuff too. but normally I would say its too small to split.  Also, I've had the sushi before (California roll-- on HH menu) -- its really good! And I normally don't get sushi just anywhere :)"}
{"text":"As a bar in the Phoenix area who advertised watching the March madness games, it's pretty sad they wouldn't turn on the sound for the Arizona state game. When clearly most people In the place were watching the game. Instead we got to listen to horrible music all night. It's Wednesday night and there are 20 persons here and 18 are cheering on the devils. Be part of the community or ship out."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  Creative menu.  Had the Kale Salad and it was really good.  Shared the Gorgonzola stuffed bacon wrapped dates and they were amazing!  Service was outstanding!!!  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has delicious burgers! If you're not into burgers, they have a nice selection on the menu. The food, together with the great beer selection makes this place a winner for sure :)"}
{"text":"Love this Restaurant! We have been here multiple times. Each and every time we have had Excellent food, Great Service and just a great place to hang out. Holly and the Mangement team made sure our Birthday celebration was the best. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed the Thirsty Lion! We are KU alums and they are a watch site for KU games. The vibe is great and there are so many people on game days!   The Thirsty Lion has the best veggie burger I have EVER had. And I have had many! My dad said his burger was awesome, too. The spinach artichoke dip is also killer! We will definitely be back. This is a great spot to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Much like the Tilted Kilt, it is an \"English\"-themed bar that's very, very American. They have a nice beer selection and that food wasn't HORRIBLE (though not noteworthy) but definitely go to Four Peaks down the street instead if you're looking for a great brewery and food experience (while supporting local business!)"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.....  PROS:   - Great Ambience - Ahi salad is delicious - Pretzel w/ cheese fondue is amazing - Fresh squeezed margarita is tasty  CONS:  - Service is hit or miss - They stopped serving the pretzel with a large cup of cheese - The fresh squeezed margarita I fell in love with hasn't tasted right the last few times I've had it - Everything else I've tried on the menu has not been very good"}
{"text":"I've been at the Thirsty Lion 3 times during the day. This was the first time I dined at night. During the day is great, but the night crew are not professional at all. I'm pretty sure they are all new staff. We (4 people) got sat in the back patio and waited 10 min for a server. They got everyone's drink but mine, I waited again for 10 min. I tried to use the restroom and got yelled at because there was a \"private dinner\" going on. Its not so private when the guests are smoking right next to us. We only got one appatiser and that was okay. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I really hope this place lasts in TMP.  Good beer selection, also a good list of signature drinks that I plan to try on my next visit.  Honestly, most of the waitresses looked like they were constantly smelling poo so we were happy when we got the one we did. She was super nice (we had a few so her name escapes me, but she was from Chicago by way of AZ), talkative, and attentive.  The food here is.....awesome. My burger was huge and had so many many delicious qualities. Every single person left full and happy.  I would definately recommend this place for every occasion whether its football on Sun, a bday party, or a happy hour.  Be warned though, outside of happy hour, they are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I went to the Thirsty Lion on a Friday following an after-work golf outing.  The service was uninspired.  It took more than 15 minutes to be seated when we were told it would be a 5 minute wait.  Actually, it would have been more than 15 minutes if our group didn't ask the servers if we could sit outside.  The waitress who served us seemed to be just going through the motions.   The food was marginal.  I ordered the Tavern Burger, medium.  It came well down and was dry (as if were being pressed down by a spatula).  Value was pretty bad as well, $20 for a burger and a beer.  I am not eager to go back here."}
{"text":"Came here after the Royals beat the Cubs to watch KState play the first 16 seed to make it to the second round. The staff was very accommodating and switched the TV we were closest to to the game. This game took place during happy hour, which the variety and quality was phenomenal. What was most impressive though is that the restaurant was not staffed for the rush that occurred from 430 to 630 the Sunday after St. Paddy's Day. Despite this, the bar staff (Bradley, Aaron and Cherokee) worked phenomenally together to literally prepare hundreds of drinks. I've experienced bartenders that have buckled under this pressure, but this crew knocked it out of the park and were very pleasant while doing it. They worked so fast that Bradley, the main bartender at the well, was running out of space to work. Luckily management knew when it was necessary to step in and help restock the bar and deliver drinks to the various tables. So props to them as well. We came here the last time we visited the area, and we will come here the next time."}
{"text":"This place took over Carlos Santana's place. Carlos place had reallly good food but was over priced. This place is over priced and the food is under-par and the service sucks! My wife and my step-son and I went there and deceided to try it because it was new and (the choice of a Good place isn't there) we were hoping for a good restaurant  in Tempe mkt. place. I guess we have to keep on looking.  My wife had the file megnon and it  and I had the steak. Our boy had the American Cobe burger. She ordered her steak med.,. It came that way but, it had no salt, no pepper and was not the tender steak that you expect when you order this steak. Slightly stringey and a lot of flavor.   I ordered the steak med. rare and I got it med. to med. well. By the time I was 3/4 thru it became med. well.   We were greated and sat outside, and sat, and sat, and sat.    We orded and got our food 20 min. later and my steak was med. well ( I ordered med rare) and my Wifes steak was as if it came from a discount mkt.,. The best thing we had there was a taste of the American\" Cobe \"burger that our boy had.   The plating was from the \"Flinstones\"! . There was a HUGE pile of mashed potatoes in the middle of the plate ( a pound or more), and the steakes proped againsted it along with aspargus. My wife was shocked @ the amount of potatoes and the plating! I guess it was to try and fool you into beleiving that the cost of the meal was worth it.   We won't be back. Where is Carlose Santana? He was over-priced but it was good.  We had a couple of drinks and our boy had a sprite. Around 90 dollars + tip. The tip was 5 dollars because we had 3 or 4 waitresses come by in the hour plus that we waited and at the end of the meal our orig. waitress showed up."}
{"text":"I've been here for Happy Hour a few times and each time it's just okay. Small portion sizes for food specials and the drink specials aren't the great. Service is always pretty slow, but this place is always packed to due to the location."}
{"text":"Good place, good service MacKenzi was very good. Portions were huuuge, this place is making America great again.  You're wroooong.  China.  Good place."}
{"text":"I had family in town and needed a place for dinner where everyone would be able to find something they liked. I looked at the menu online and figured with the variety of sandwiches, salads, pizzas and entrees this would be a safe bet. Luckily I was right.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect. The atmosphere was nice. Nice lighting, comfortable tables and we were right by a big firepit that was pretty cool. Even though it's at a \"mall\" it didn't feel like it.  A couple of us ordered salads and a couple ordered fish and chips. I got the chicken waldorf salad which was huge. All the portions were huge, actually. The lettuce was crisp, the dressing wasn't too overpowering and there were big chunks of chicken, apples and walnuts. I could have easily done with a half order - they should consider that. :) My family members really enjoyed their entrees as well. My aunt cleared her plate of fish and chips!  Overall it was a great choice. If you're looking for solid \"American\" food that is a step up from greasy bar food this is a good option."}
{"text":"My first time going to eat at thirsty lion. It's got a great ambiance and nice staff. It's got lots of classic pub food. We started with the pretzels and pub cheese and chicken tenderloins. The pretzels were tasty but the pub cheese was ok. Chicken tenderloins were moist and juicy but the ranch sauce was meh. I liked the BBQ sauce they had on the side with it. Chicken has a lot of seasoning but still pretty tasty. Then we split the peppercorn bacon burger cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly with the right amount of pink in the middle. I also had the Tennessee honey lemonade which was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I've been going to this spot regularly since they opened and the food is always excellent! Whether this spot is slammed on a Friday night, or you check it out during lunch hour, you will be pleased with the quality of the food and service.    The burgers are my favorite, every combination is delicious and perfectly cooked.  The fish and chips are great (for being in AZ) & the beer selection is massive!  Definitely give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The interior beat my expectations, and the bar was big with decent beer selections and quality pizza and appetizers for happy hour. Service was solid. I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We went to thirsty lion on valentines day and had great service. Shout out to our server steve. The Brussel sprouts and pancetta were great. Also the mojito! We ordered the ultimate nachos without cheese, and unfortunately it came out with cheese; but steve was very accommodating and had them remade for us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, checking out the current Happy Hour Drinks & Food.  Started off with a Lion's Lemonade and then a Raspberry Drop.  We tried Salmon Cakes, Potato Cakes & Q Pork Sliders.  This place never disappoints, good food & great service, no matter busy the get."}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to dine here after seeing a movie at Harkins. We ordered two salads, the southwest chicken and a caesar with cubed chicken which were priced at 14$ I believe. The salads were delivered and we were less than impressed by the portion size. The size of both salads were comparable to a side salad order, not an entree salad for dinner. The service was moderate and the mangers approach to the situation was very weak and disappointing. We haven't had the best experiences at this location and this past experience definitely ruined it for us. We will most definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Good love to hang out with friends. We had a large group of 30 people, who primarily came for drinks but few ordered food. Everyone was nice and attentive, but for 30 people you'd think there will be more than one server. Unfortunately  we had only one, who was nice and attentive but one person taking orders for all means more wait time for the first person who ordered. So the 4 starts are for good service and servers, 1 Star less for management dropping the ball on this."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch football, even if your team disappoints you.  The staff was very friendly and attentive as we sat through a very long, drawn out game.    The menu is a bit crowded (I prefer restaurants that know what they are), there is something for everyone.  The appetizers are nice, the pizza was good, and every one enjoyed their entrees.   It was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their \"huge\" number of taps... while I can't dispute that they have 52 beers on tap, I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking.. and that the prices here are on the ok to high side... I would never come back if it's not happy hour or late night pricing. I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if I'm paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isn't Scottsdale or a hotel bar.    Well the good news, Thirsty Lion is quite lovely inside, plenty of seating and dim lights, really not a bad place to relax and mellow out. Plus, the food was great, everything we've had has been very tasty, now it's all been off of the happy hour menu, but that's the only time I'll probably be here, the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation. I'm hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented, but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu, Thirsty Lion just doesn't stand out enough to steal me away from Boulders or Taste of Tops..."}
{"text":"We went out with a big party on Saturday night and the service was very good.  Unfortunately, the food quality fell short on every level.    I ordered the beef tenderloin tips which was off the seasonal menu.  It came out looking like soup all over the plate with a huge helping of mashed potatoes.  After taking only one bite of the mashed potatoes I realized they were instant and not satisfying at all.  The only thing was good on my plate was a few pieces of meat mixed in the stew and my green beans.  Food quality was poor for several of our guests and even saw that someone from another table left their helping of mashed potatoes as well.  Make REAL potatoes with quality ingredients and this place might be worth it.  Will not be back as the qaulity of the food and the price was not worth our time."}
{"text":"Dinner there last night. Very loud but fun. We had a reservation for 6:45. They seated us at 6:48 and apologized for being tardy. So funny.   We had bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. I'd highly recommend you try this dish. Really unusual but really good.   For dinner we split shrimp tacos and a Cobb salad. Our waitress had them split the food in the kitchen. When they brought out our dinner I thought they hadn't split our meal. Not true. Just a ton of delicious food. The tacos were on homemade corn tortillas. They came with black beans and a homemade salsa on the side. The Cobb salad was prepared beautifully. The presentation of both dishes was spectacular. And they were very tasty.   Service was tip top. The prices were extremely reasonable.   If I ever return to this area, I'll make a point to stop here."}
{"text":"We came here to try something new, and we were not disappointed. We had a reservation for 6:45 and we were sat early. We ordered the Santa Fe Nachos and fries. Oh, and I ordered a Blood Orange Margarita. The Blood Orange Margarita was sweet, just a bit sweeter than what I like. The nachos were  full of flavor.... EXCEPT the chicken was kinda cold? The fries were crisp and were delicious! Our server, Katie (spell check) was friendly and very attentive. We enjoyed our experience and will definitely be back. The only thing I would say.... next time I hope our nachos are all around warm."}
{"text":"Yelp classified this place as DOG FRIENDLY but NO IT IS NOT.  Bad on on you yelp, and bad on Thirsty Lion for going with dog friendly status!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! We were on vacation from so cal and sat at the bar for the dodger game. Shana was an excellent bartender! Very friendly, quick, and super informative.   We had the cheese dip and split the caprese chicken sandwich. I'd recommend both. Really good!  Will be back next time we're in Scottsdale. :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been back to this restaurant several times since my last review and it has been good every time. The service has been hit or miss but the food has been fantastic every time we have dined here. We are both creatures of habit and this restaurant has definitely become a habit. The soft pretzels with fondue cheese, delish, the jalapeno pepper jack burger amazing!   The beer specials vary from day to day. The music which they play also varies, I recommend Tuesday nights which is classic rock and Kilt Lifter, a great combination. We sometimes come here just for beer and apps but sometimes we go all out and order entrees. Food consistency has been great. Courtnie is one of the best waitresses, ask for her section.  I will be returning!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I stopped in one afternoon for lunch and were very impressed with everything. There was about a group of 6 of us and we all walked out pretty pleased, even including the one that you can typically never please. I think just her opinion alone was what helped me decide on a solid five star review.   When we had stopped in at about 2pm we were greeted by the manager and a hostess. They were both extremely nice and were very quick to get us seated and promptly started us with our drink orders. Drinks came in a flash and came with the menu. The waitress dropped the drinks off and did not even hesitate to hand them to us as if she took the orders. She handed us the menus, answered some random questions and was on her way. Typical me, I was very thirsty that day and JUST as I was finishing my first pint, over she came asking if i needed a refill. WOW! talk about attentive! After a few minuets she was back and took all of our orders. She even came over and whispered, asking me if I would like another pint in a few minuets with lunch. ABSOLUTELY!  My Pepper Bacon Cheeseburger came with another pint and I was as happy as a clam. The burger was cooked perfectly and was probably one of the better burgers I had gotten in the area. Kudos to the chef!   After all was said and done, fantastic lunch and fantastic experience, I was even given a few of the Thirsty Lion glasses to bring home for the bar!  Next time I'm in the area I can assure you that I will be back and would highly recommend to anyone looking to get lunch in the area!"}
{"text":"First visit to a Thirsty Lion ever.   THE GOOD: Place looks the part (aside of the hospitality of the hostesses upon arrival). We had the black bean quinoa burgers and they were amazing. Hands down perhaps the best vegetarian burgers we have ever had. They were huge and deliciously messy to eat. The fries were a bit over-salted and conflicted with the flavor of the burger. Next time I may try the cole slaw or salad instead.  Table service was great also. These was never a moment our drinks weren't refreshed. A+ for food and A+ to Patrick for the service.   THE BAD: On arrival we were \"greeted\" by a handful of hostess type \"kids.\" None of them had name tags or a recognizable brand outfit so you assumed they were the hostesses. I say \"greeted\" when we walked in, aside of a blank stare and a \"how many\" look, we were not acknowledged. A male host took us to a table. One side of the table was facing the glaring sun and when I asked if we could have a different table, he actually said \"whatever.\" It was obvious that the hosts need to be trained in hospitality.   Was it not for the food and the great table service I would probably never return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been to the one in Tempe and now I'm Gilbert. Great selections of beer on tap, great atmosphere and excellent food! I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"It's ok. I don't eat meat so not much to choose from. But! The pizza was tasty. Pretty much the only meal that was not an appetizer. We went once. If say good for others not for me. I don't eat much junk/bar food but that doesn't mean it isn't have great views for t.v. to watch games. It's kind of loud but it's not a family place id say so that's expected. I'd go back again.. but more so for drinks and football not the food. Just more of a health eater. My friends loved their food.."}
{"text":"Come here on the regular for lunch/dinner. The staff is always friendly and engaging. The staff always remembers our drink/food orders. Have always had a pleasant experience and would recommend to most when in this area for an easy bite and drink with a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like it. They serve food late night and have some good choices. Good deals during happy hour too. In about a dozen visits I have been able to try several things on the menu. My favorites are the cobb salad, the reuben sandwich (I ask for turkey instead of corned beef), and the green chile chicken sandwich.  The customer service is great. I brought my parents here for lunch on a recent visit, and the waitress overheard us talking about how it was their 40th anniversary weekend. She must have told the manager, because he appeared at the end of the meal with an ice cream sundae for my folks, a card for a free appetizer, as well as a greeting card where the staff signed their anniversary wishes. That was totally unexpected and very cool of them."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times for lunch. Food is good! Service is amaizing! Nicole at the bar is beyond attentive, very pleasant and sweet!  Beer is cold! Golf on the tvs needs to go though!!"}
{"text":"Felt bad about my one star rating. It wasn't awful. Upgrading to two stars."}
{"text":"Went to Thirsty Lion for dinner with some out of town guests.  Colton was our waiter and five stars to him.  He was one of the best servers we have ever had -- extremely personable, delightful and great service.  Food was delicious - don't leave without trying their Bacon Wrapped Dates!  Thanks again to Colton for making our evening that much more enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"Good Food!  Great Beer!  Lots of TV's.  Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Judging by the reviews, you either love or hate this place. My experience was rather frustrating... A friend & I joined others during happy hour, who were already seated with drinks. Servers came to check on things and did not acknowledge either of us. Servers came back to check on things.. did not acknowledge us or 2 others who wanted a drink. One drink was ordered by my friend who had to say excuse me as the guy was walking away.   Anyway, long story short I drank my friend's ice water and did not eat. I left after being ignored for 50 minutes. Annoying."}
{"text":"This is their first weekend for brunch.  Excellent service by Elle - she made it easy for my husband and I to share our entrees.  We started with Spanish Coffee with 151.  Nicely presented !  I got the amazing French Toast - 6 huge pieces. Dipped in whiskey drenched eggs and crunchy corn flakes and fried. Wow - add the whiskey syrup to add a subtle boost.  Hubby had Huervos Rancheros which were good but not extraordinary. We were glad we shared because by themselves, it would have been too much.   And we can't go to TL without splitting a bowl of beer cheese soup!   We will be back because we want to try the other brunch menu options.  And we will ask for Elle's table!"}
{"text":"The left hand brewing nitro milk stout has an amazing head and is so rich and creamy and flavorful. Ambiance of the place is hip. Our waiter was super friendly. Burger and bacon dates were fantastic. Great place!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here but they did not want my business of 1. I went in fully realizing they are super busy. There were 2 2top ahead of me and 3 2 tops behind me. The hostess's seated the 2 in front of me.   They asked if I wanted the bar I said no because the bats are always open seats and I did not see any. They made an attempt to go and look for a table. The second hostess proceed to seat the people behind me.   They came back and said there was one seat at the bar on the corner and I could have it. I went over to said seat and some guy was reserving it.   I was going to go back to rhe hostess but by the time I headed back there were two more sets of people at the door. I just walked out. The patio area had a good 7 empty tables. I understand I am just 1 person but obviously they don't need or want my money of they are busy."}
{"text":"The appetizer dates are the best thing on earth! But you only get 4 so don't come with a huge appetite.  Was expensive for the tiny beers you get. Probably wouldn't choose this place over another."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here.  :(. We were 8 minutes late and they had already cancelled our Open Table Reservation.  Sat us in a section near the back (was pretty difficult to get the wheelchair over the wall tracks in the floor)...kind of embarrassing for both my husband and me.  Once seated, 20 minutes had passed and not one person came to our table.  Had to leave because we would not have had enough time to eat and get back to work."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed being there. We had our 20 year high school reunion here. The atmosphere was great, food was awesome and we had great waiters and waitresses. I would go back. If you haven't  been there please check it out."}
{"text":"Very poor service at the bar. Consistently had to flag someone down for everything from water to ordering and paying. Being ignored and poor service have a way of ruining an enjoyable meal out. I am not sure if they are attempting the team service approach at the bar, but it does not seem less or even affective. We asked a mail server to order food and he replied give me a minute and never returned. The two females were too busy gossiping, texting on their phones, and checking their smart watches to be attentive or even appear to care about customer service. We complain to the manager that we had received or service and asked him to refill our waters he returned with the waters and apologize for the wait, but did nothing to inquire about the poor service or remedy the situation. This is unfortunate, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a nice time here on an impromptu first date. Great patio atmosphere with fire pit(s) for heat and really good service from the standpoint that our waiter gave the right amount of attention (not a lot) considering we each only had a glass of wine and were not there for food. My Sav Blanc was on point, and so was the woman I met there, but that is besides the review. Lots of TVs and cool seating arrangement inside. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place! First time we sat at the bar in Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend enjoyed a snake bite and I had one of their signature cocktails, Grapefruit and basil martini. OMG! Where has this cocktail been all my life? It's life summer in a glass. So delicious and refreshing. Ok, I didn't have one I had three.  For food we had the scotch eggs, calamari, kale salad and pulled park sandwich. It was all delicious. The bartender was very nice and our drinks were always full.  Ate their again for dinner and the drinks and food were all excellent!"}
{"text":"i had a work meeting here and it's exactly the type of  average, mediocre, corporate food/bar/entertainment place I don't like. It was packed. enough said."}
{"text":"Really nice place for a mall restaurant. Big place too with lots of seating. The hostess was really great the day we visited and the server was very good too.  Nice tap beer selection and the food was very good. They have specials here too like dinner and a movie where you get half price pizza if you show your movie ticket during the summer months. They have other specials too.  It was nice and cool inside and felt great after being out in the 117F heat. I would come back here if ever in the Scottsdale area again."}
{"text":"It was busy, Saturday evening, it was noisy, you couldn't hear the music, it was expensive, $16 for 3 fish tacos.  If I think a place is expensive, but they are busy, they must be doing something right.  We aren't fans of mall restaurants and there is a lot of construction going on. It was our first time and we parked at the opposite end of the mall requiring quite a hike, our fault.  We live in Glendale and probably won't make the trek again, but it wasn't a bad experience, just OK."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour and had a great time. The food was good, the drinks were great, but it was our waiter who made it awesome! Michael was so nice both my kids said on the way out they couldn't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"soup was almost  great the beer and chedder  but a bit salty ,   kids meal was not cynical e.g, not the cheapest thing they could fob him off with.   service almost too fast :  We'd not had time to knock out the soup by the time the table started to stack like O'Hare airport on a holiday weekend.   My enchilada stack seems all over the place , like 2 or 3 meals vying to win you over but not really delivering on any one of them.  It was ok in a let's push it all together and see what occurs but I won\t be repeating the dish.    Fish chips,  were nicely sized,good batter and fries came out right. They don't have as much cider available as I'd like to see in a place that makes allusions to being a UK theme but there's going to be something you like  to drink there unless you're so into beer that you need to see the resume of the brewer prior:)     Visited around 1230 midweek , 3/4 full, service good though a little rushed."}
{"text":"We loved the food and beverage selections (52 beers on tap!) BUT our waitress made this experience a little sour. We waited a long time for our drink order then when we finally got them, she never checked back on us for refills. We waited and waited for service and when we got it, it was like the second she got there she couldn't wait to leave the table. I will come back one more time because of the delicious food but if I get crappy service again, this place is DEAD to me."}
{"text":"The food I tried was bad.  Not average but bad.  That makes it difficult to give this place more than 2 stars.  If I was just out for a beer before a movie this would be a good spot but I don't think i'd go for a meal."}
{"text":"i had only been there for their pre-grand opening before.  food was average at best.  This time was not impressed. the server, sami, seemed like she didn't really want to be there.  will not be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with a friend because the other restaurant we wanted to dine at for lunch was closed. We were seated right away and our drinks arrived rather quickly. It took a while for me to decide what I wanted to eat, since I had my heart set on that other restaurant, but our waitress was very understanding and patient. Finally, I decided on the smoked chicken Waldorf salad - apples, walnuts, and chevre cheese. My salad was really good - I especially liked the apple honey dressing. It brought the entire salad together. My husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips and our friend ordered the bacon cheese burger.  The fish and chips were good, the fish was flakey and I liked the batter they used. The chips (fries) were good as well. Our friend enjoyed his burger, no complaints there. Overall, it was a good meal in which we got to catch up with our friend. It wasn't anything above average, but not bad. If we were in the area, we might go again."}
{"text":"Good service. Adequate house margarita for happy hour. I just had a hard time with fish and chips being priced at $16. It is such a typical pub food and there's nothing special about it. It was fine, just not something i would ever pay that much for again."}
{"text":"This rating is for the quinoa and black bean veggie burger. Best I've ever had. Delicious and flavorful!!! BOMB!"}
{"text":"Bree and randi are over the top amazing bar tenders. If you died and went to heaven, these to amazing woman would be the ones that waited on you there. I truly can't say enough amazing things about them. Even if the food was garbage (which it is not) i would go there just for the service.... it's that great.  Update. So i was in tonight and had another great experience. Jacqueline at the bar was amazing. Every time i go i get more and more impressed with the service. At this point i would go there just for the service, because it's that damn good."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience. Staff is friendly. The food is amazing. I love the peppercorn ranch!"}
{"text":"Cool location and just an overall fun place.  We went for appetizers and drinks.  Those bacon wrapped dates?  Ya those are very tasty.   Add a plate of loaded chicken nachos and you are good to go.  Drinks were pretty standard.  My only knock?  Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Was not disappointed here! We were actually headed to a different restaurant at the Marketplace and saw this place. Not sure what it was so we stopped in. Now it's our fav spot to meet up with people. Food is great, service is great. I recommend."}
{"text":"We always really love coming here. The environment is relaxed, the staff is nice, and the food is delicious. The bacon wrapped dates are to die for and the beer cheese soup is always a delicious option. My husband and I always say you don't have to worry about sticking with your usual here because everything is good!"}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere. Good place to watch the game or have dinner with the family. I had the Reuben and loved it. Pizza is also very good. The menu is very diverse and I believe they will do a good job with every item there."}
{"text":"Pretty solid restaurant, with a modernness Yard House vibe. Great beer selection, 6-8$ beers. Happy hour was small portions but fair priced.  I would eat here again I just wouldn't go out of my way for this \"gastropub\""}
{"text":"Twas the week before Christmas and I found my self stuck at Fashion Square mall attempting to get some last minute holiday shopping done and not loose my sanity. With the prospect of my Christmas shopping looking grim I decided it was time to regroup and grab lunch and a drink. I need a place that was away from all the commotion and figured Thirsty Lion would be my perfect place of refuge.  Walking in they were super busy, I found my little spot of heaven at the bar and quickly ordered a bloody mary. It was delicious and was nice and spicy. I arrived during HH, but I had my eyes on their I.P.A. Beer Battered Fish & Chips Crispy fried with Napa slaw, lemon caper tartar sauce and hand-cut fries. They arrived pretty quickly and they were delicious. Perfectly crispy on the outside and nice and juicy inside. Their slaw had a great flavor and their fries were great. I was really pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was and how great the service was. Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill is the perfect spot for a quick and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my review and add that when I was at the Thirsty Lion a few days ago they played not one but two Creed songs. I don't understand."}
{"text":"Cloudy, overcast day in Tempe and a perfect day for lunch at the Thirsty Lion. We did a little shopping, then headed inside for some nachos, flatbread and salad. Washed it all down with some wine. The service was very good and the food and drink were great. The restaurant was clean and the decor is very \"pubby\"."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday for a girls dinner at around 530 we waited about 20 min for a table. Our waitress was very friendly and knew the menu well. Since some of us had not been there before she was able to give us her option on what to eat. It took a long time to get our drinks so they ended up giving us free dessert which we didn't expect. The spicy mac and cheese was too spicy for one of the girls to eat but our other friend ate it all. The eggs are a must it's like breakfast in a bite"}
{"text":"I was tremendously unimpressed tonight on our first visit to the thirsty lion at the Santan Village location, we've been to the Tempe marketplace location several times and had a great experience. this experience was entirely different, we asked for the check and to go boxes, it took 20 minutes until finally we asked a passerby how we pay her check and then we waited another five minutes for service show up. They didn't give us a receipt jacket but just left a receipt on the table. I asked the waitress if they offer the bill in a bill jacket and she said no they don't do that. I did notice on the way out another table did have a bill jacket. When we paid we had to physically hand a card over to the waitress. We left with two to go boxes and no bag and I dropped both of them on the floor. I asked the attendant at the front counter if there were any to go bags, she said yes and walk to the back and came back and without opening the bag for me as my hands were obviously full she handed me the bag and turned and proceeded to talk with one of the staff and yawned.   i'll never come back. we were delayed 30 minutes to take her to-year-old home and were thoroughly and completely unimpressed. I wasted seven dollars of a tip on that place.   I gave one star for the food, which was good. unfortunately food is not the only thing that makes a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was really good. We got the spinach dip, BBQ pizza and penne/gorgonzola pasta.   Only thing was, our server (Stephanie) was suuper weird. awkward. in a hurry. didnt seem to even wanna serve us. And only came to us like 2 times while we were there.  The food runner was more attentive to us than our server was.   Anyway. Yes food was delightful and tasty, but make sure you dont get sat in Stephanies area!"}
{"text":"Very slow service - waited amost 10 minutes for server. The food took even longer.  The music is horrible - more suited for a night club, not an English pub.....  The food is average. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for a few beers and dinner last night.  I liked the feel, and the bar stools are very comfy.  The atmosphere was good.  There was some trouble at the bar, as we wanted to order dinner from the bar.  One bartender said he'd take our order then promptly left for a really long time - like we didn't see him again for 20 minutes.  In the meantime we tried another bartender.  He confessed he was a barback and wasn't clued in on the menu.  The same happened with another person behind the bar.  We were in the process of getting up to go elsewhere for dinner when Star took the reins.  She assured us she would take control of the disorder and fix everything.  My friend ordered the sirloin with asparagus, and she said it was really good.  I ordered the grilled salmon with seasonal greens and the salmon was extraordinarily good.  Cooked to perfection and served hot off the grill.  This was an example of somebody (Star) noticing a failure in progress and successfully saving it.  I didn't give them a 5 star because I got a discount - there was no discount - the rating is based on the service I ended up receiving, the quality of the atmosphere, and the outstanding food and beverages.  I'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience today! We dined there for lunch today and everything was great. The ahi salad was so fresh and everyone I was with enjoyed their meal. The service was fast and attentive and the manager even stopped by our table. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service is just OK... The menu is overpriced for the most part.  There are better options in Tempe Marketplace if you're looking for a place to eat there.  You're getting Chili's-quality food for Cheesecake Factory prices at this place"}
{"text":"We needed a place in between where we were and where our son lives so we got the rec from other Yelp users. We had the spiced bacon burger and Pub Burger. Both were quite good and huge. Music was WAY too loud so it made it hard to hear our own conversation even outside. (It was even louder inside, and there were at least a dozen TV screens....yuck). Service was good although we had to ask for napkins and silver ware. This was very hard to find via GPS due to the high concentration of restaurants and shops in the area."}
{"text":"Thanks for the free lunch Thirsty Lion!  This estrablishment invited Yelp Elite to have lunch on them.  My review is NOT based on the free factor. :)  I'm grateful for the opportunity to come here because a) I didn't know it'd even opened and b) I probably wouldn't have come in to eat being as how I assumed it was 'bar food'.  They have an expansive menu, but not so expansive that it's overwhelming.  Ranging from your standard healthy and not healthy appetizers, to salads,flatbreads,  burgers, entrees including fish, pasta, etc.. this has something for everyone.   The soup of the day was clam chowder and I enjoyed all of it's creamy goodness. Not too bland, not too salty (common chowder issues),and you could see the large chunks of potato, clams, carrots, etc.  Delicious.  I opted for the steak salad and was not disappointed.  This is quite a large entrée size salad and filled me up.  Steak cooked to order is served over a bed of greens, grape tomatoes, red peppers, and toasted onions with balsamic. Delicious. The chimichurri sauce on the steak is delicious.  My service was prompt, courteous and I didn't feel rushed.  They have standard and late night happy hours and ample tv coverage in the bar itself.   They also have a great variety of beers for this beer snob. :) This is a great addition to the mall and will give that *other* sports bar a run for it's money."}
{"text":"We've been to many places on our visit to Scottsdale and must say our visit to thirsty lion was a pleasure with a wonderful bartender named Shaina. The food was good but the service was even better. As long as you hire bartenders like this one we will be back"}
{"text":"I don't know why this has become my \"go to\" favorite place to eat other than the fact that management has an eye for customer service and the kitchen puts out plates that are seasoned and prepared consistently.  I've had the steak, pizza, pulled pork, fish and chips, dip with flatbread, and a few more I'm sure but I'm tired of listing them here. Each one was totally edible and good to nosh. I love when I go somewhere and the servers or bartenders look you in the eye and you know they are listening to you and not looking past you to something else they have to do. This comes from scheduling your help to match your busy hours so they are not rushed. Whatever they did in hiring or training..... they got the point across that they are in the \"service\" and \"hospitality\" industry. They carry out this mission well and I always feel like my business is appreciated.   The kitchen: who ever designed the menu put enough items so the kitchen can handle a rush and enough items that one could go here regularly without getting burned out.  This gastropub concept puts food, service, comfort, and drink on an equal plane. This is my favorite place to eat because I don't need to be blown away by one part of the concept design, but rather the blending of all aspects of the concept into a fine tuned operation. This starts with ownership, management and trickles down all the way to the most important person in the house.... the cleaning crew.......because when you walk in somewhere and feel clean and safe....the rest is gravy. Nothing worse than walking in somewhere and seeing a dirty floor or door or bathroom. If they don't give this most visible item attention.... what kind of attention do they give to the things you don't see? I give a well done to the Thirsty Lion staff and management."}
{"text":"Needed a bloody Mary badly after shopping 'til we dropped! Stopped in here because we saw the bar, but were intrigued by the menu after we sat down. They have a decent selection of beer, and a wine list for days (I don't drink wine, so I didn't read it.) The husband had a Moscow mule which was excellent and I had well deserved bloody Mary. I was disappointed that there were no olives in my drink, but quickly got over that because it tasted wonderful. Typical gastropub menu, but a lot of options for adventuresome foodie types and for the picky eater. The waitress was slow and inattentive, but we were not in a hurry. We would go back if we are ever out shopping and need adult libations...shop until you drop! Or drink :) Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch.  It is a very spacious location with a large patio and indoors.  I sat outside with my party.  There are nice screens to help block the amount of direct sunlight.  The server was prompt.  She also alerted us to when she had to go to a shift meeting or something.  The food came out quickly.  It was good.  I had the french dip with a salad as a side, and my friend had the fish and chips.  They both came as very generous portions.  We didn't have room for desserts, and we had skipped appetizers.  The appetizer menu looks great, but I figured I wasn't hungry enough to try one.  I am a fan of gastropubs even though I don't drink for the food and atmosphere.  I think this is very nice new location."}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt service ..oh and the food was good too! Wasn't very busy when we went for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff.  Manager came over to say hi and discovered we were going to The movies after and told us that he was giving us 1/2 off our pizza because we were movie goers.  Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Arrived mid-afternoon on a Thursday. Place was relatively busy but there were plenty of servers to keep the place humming. Unfortunately we got the slowest server in the herd. After the initial greeting and placing drink orders we saw her maybe twice more after a 90 minute lunch. Lots of downtime with empty glasses, which is a bummer.   Our order was simple. A turkey sandwich and a bacon mac n cheese plate.  The food arrived in a reasonable time and was piping hot/fresh. Wife says the sandwich was excellently fresh. My Mac n cheese had a funny taste to it, I couldn't quite place it. I might have considered mentioning something to our server (which I never do but this was a $15 plate of macaroni) but she was MIA. I ate about 1/3 and called it quits.   I almost choked when I got a $70 bill. 2 glasses of white wine and a beer I guess put us over the top. Wasn't quite expecting that tab for a so-so lunch and poor service but oh well, lesson learned.   Lots of bar food options -- burgers, sandwiches, salads. The straight beer selection was decent albeit a little overpriced. Wine list was the same- limited and expensive. Add slow service to the mix and this is somewhere I'll have a real hard time coming back to. Especially where there are far better options in the San Tan area."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Not likely to go back unless it's just for happy hour. The pizza wasn't very good but the calamari was decent"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow as we had to hunt down our waitress a few times.  Drinks and food were good, nothing special or extraordinary but also not sub par by any means.  Good for a happy hour or after work drinks but I would not make a special trip here"}
{"text":"We went to the Thirsty Lion since they are a sponsor or partner of the new Phoenix Rising soccer team down the street. The only reason we went is due to the way the \"Official Pre-match Party\" was worded: from 3-6 enjoy $1 off beers, from 6-9 there will be $1 specials on select beers. To a reasonable person, that sounds like beers should be $1 from 6-9 due to the wording change.   We showed up shortly before 6 and the place was packed--I thought it was due to the great special they were running. About 15 minutes in we were still sitting there with no waters or drinks of any kind. Finally, the server came over and we asked about the special. She had no idea what we were talking about. You'd think if you were having the \"Official Pre-match Party\" you would tell your servers about it, right?  She went and asked about the special and came back and informed us that it was actually just $1 off the beers from 6-9. Why would you word it so poorly then? Just use the same phrasing you used for the 3-6 promotion. Its really easy to do, arguably easier than changing the wording, and then you won't mislead customers.  I expressed my displeasure and asked to see the normal happy hour menu. The server said its in that menu while pointing to the menu on our table. As I looked at the menu, she walked around taking drink orders from the rest of the table. Then she just waled away after looking at me. Clearly I wanted to order a drink, I just asked to look at the drink menu.  She went to another table, took their orders, then started to walk away from our section. I had to get her attention to even place an order.   It took forever to get the drinks to the table, they were horrible understaffed. Again, if you are having the \"Official Pre-match Party\" you think you'd have an extra server and bartender working, but its evident that thinking ahead is not something the Thirsty Lion Management seems to do.   It took about an hour to get one round of drinks. Now I get the meaning behind the name, if you come to the Thirty Lion you will stay thirsty the whole time. We promptly paid and went to another one of the dozens of restaurant around the Thirsty Lion and received great service.   It was my first and last time visiting the Thirsty Lion, and I recommend you don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. We went two different times and had the same server, Steve. He was super attentive and helpful. We were out of towners and he gave great advice. And the food, oh my!!  Absolutely delicious!!  I highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love the food and variety, late hours when I want to be a fat kid late nights. Staff is friendly and for it being such a big operation if have to say they do a pretty good job. Never been disappointed and been there several times."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch bite while at the mall.  My first time visiting the Thirsty Lion.  I like the ambiance.  Our service was really good.  The manager was especially friendly.  Our waiter gave the impression he wasn't thrilled we had brought our kids (even though they love to eat out and are extremely well behaved) but the service he provided was still very good. The food was delicious.  They have a fairly large menu and it was hard for this foodie to decide what to order.  I ended up with the veggie panino which was a pesto lovers delight (yep, that's me!).  My hubby got the cubano sandwich and he liked it but said it was a bit too spicy.  That is saying something cause he loves spicy food.  Could have just been those particular jalapeños but he ended up taking them off (which shocked me to no end) cause it was giving him heartburn.  Kids meals were very good as well.  Fries are salty and delicious!  Overall we were happy with our meal and will return.  They also have a seasonal menu that changes.  I always like to see that."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good pub food. Great beer and cider selection. The staff has been personable and professionable in my three visits. Needs live music. Where's the live music?"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in for a few drinks and apps and had the best service! Our bartender, Jen, was friendly and very helpful. The managers, Tim and Howard, made a point to really welcome us to the restaurant and gave us free appetizer cards because it was our first time.  We all spilt the artichoke dip, a pizza, the pear salad and the charcuterie board which were all fantastic. We will certainly be back for the great service and delicious food! Thank you Thirsty Lion and staff for the great experience!"}
{"text":"So the place ended up getting three stars... let me explain.   First off, the service is great.  The hostess friendly and attentive, my waiter friendly and accommodating, and the manager very attentive.   I ordered a margarita and the filet mignon with extra crispy fries and the slaw.  They were very accommodating of my request to change my side options. The slaw was just okay.  The fries were good and just how I liked them. The margarita was tasty.  Now the steak.   The steak has a great taste.  Flavored nicely. However the cook.  I asked for medium and the steak brought out was well done. I hesitated sending it back... I don't like to be fussy... but it was mignon and eating a mignon well done is simply ruining a good steak. I asked for it to be redone. They were very apologetic and accommodating.   They left me my sides and took back the steak and brought out another one a while later (when I was completely done with my sides).  The new steak was medium well to well again (they brought a second order of fries that I just couldn't eat).  Not cooked as asked again. This time I simply ate it... obviously the cook doesn't know how to temperature steaks.  The new cut was also not as good as the one originally sent (see pic). They offered me a dessert on the house which I declined, but still charged me for my drink (which was only 5 bucks).  I don't know.  Seemed tacky. Oh well.    While the service was great, and I might try this place for other things, I would stay away from the steaks!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times.  The first time was just okay, I'm attracted to the outdoor patio setup they have. It seems decent.  The first time I ordered the Risotto.  Whatever creative concept their chef manufactured was mediocre, kind of bland in flavor.  The second time I ordered Artichoke appetizer and it was covered in salt masking the authenticity of the natural flavors from the vegetable.  I didn't finish it.  The 3rd time I got just a piece of grilled salmon, and it was tasty.  The manager didn't think the fish was a big enough portion to justify the price so he even brought an additional helping of salmon!  But it was the outside I wanted, for the environment, and the server (Shannon) was all kinds of chatty and must have thought I wanted a friend ( I went alone) - she took a seat at my table and talked to me for 30 minutes! I wasn't really into trying to be friends with the server, that's not why I went. Overall a 'dry' experience in general."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Thirsty Lion for an afternoon meal (about 3pm-4pm).  There was no wait and staff was friendly and attentive.  The menu had a large variety of choices and so much of it looked good.  My wife had such a hard time deciding she ended up going with a couple things.  She got the oven baked soft pretzel, the bacon cheddar potato cakes, and the spicy fried chicken sliders.  All of them were great.  I especially loved the chicken sliders!  I ended up going with Gastropub burger and a the Arizona beer flight.  The burger was delicious!  I would have a hard time choosing something else next time.  Our server was laid back but very helpful.  He checked in on us regularly and answered all our questions.  We will definitely be back.  The only thing I would change is the chairs.  We sat at one of the hightop tables and they were not very comfortable.  Next time I'll ask for one of the shorter tables."}
{"text":"The restaurant is huge.  The beer selection is awesome.  The Food is disappointing.  If I were just going in for a beer and some cheap eats during happy hour or reverse happy hour, I may have have loved Thirsty Lion.  But just stopping in for a meal, not so great.  I had the Green Chii Chicken Sandwich.  Not bad.  Just nothing special.  Slightly messier and soggy than I would like my sandwiches to be.  My Fiancé had the Southwest Chicken Salad.  Horrible.  The salad was big and looked nice.  But it was mostly cabbage, the chicken tasted like a bag of sliced tyson chicken from the grocery store, the corn was nearly impossible to find, and the avocado didn't taste ripe.  It was almost as much of punishment for me to watch her pick through it as it must have been for her to eat it.  The dressing that came with the salad was fantastic."}
{"text":"Happy Hour was not bad. But the music was way too loud! I could hardly hear the people sitting at our table! That really makes a good place suck! Couldn't wait to get the check and get out of there. Next time, anywhere else is an upgrade."}
{"text":"Usually I'm suspicious of a restaurant that offers sushi and burgers and tacos. Some places just need to pick a genre. But so far any and every cuisine I've sampled from this gastropub located in Tempe Marketplace has been impressive. My usual is their grilled vegetable panini (zucchini on a sandwich? Yes!) and one of their many beers on tap. Service is decent for a bar that mostly hires college kids. My only complaint is a lame one, but this place is so damn loud. This is a popular bar with a massive floor plan and lots of speakers. I'm a girl who enjoys indie rock just as much as the next millennial but this is a place you REALLY HAVE TO SHOUT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WHEN ITS BUSY."}
{"text":"The menu has a nice selection! I particularly like the fish & chips (best that I've found) and the Sonoran Enchilada Stack.  Everyone I've been with there has enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  The service is outstanding!  They are very attentive.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Overall, not impressed.  The service was incredibly slow.  We ordered appetizers that took over 20 minutes to get to our table, and then our entrees showed up before we could even finish them.  My husband compared his French dip sandwich to a steakum.   I had the shrimp tacos.  The flavor was good but for 3 tacos there was probably the equivalent of 3 shrimp.   We then made the mistake of ordering desserts.   Another 20 minute wait.   Sorry to say, won't be back."}
{"text":"I like thirsty lion but they need better taps.  When I order. $7 beer I'd like a full glass.  This is without taking a drink!  I never have this problem at other bars.."}
{"text":"Comfortable and inviting patio area with fire pit.  Good service & food"}
{"text":"Try the habanero margarita!!!! Service was good, our waitress was friendly and personable.  Clean establishment with clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion is a great place to grab a few drinks after work on a Friday afternoon!   Alyssa R., another coworker, a former coworker and I are all off work by 2PM on Friday's, so this place was a convenient location to mingle.   Comfy and unpretentious atmosphere, this is definitely a laid back place to chill.  We sat in the bar area. Big, leather backless stools. It gets a smidgen noisy in there, but it didn't deter our group from enjoyable conversation . . . And perhaps contributing to said noise level, oops!  What did I notice right away? The draft beer selection. Holy whack, I think there were like 45!   I ended up drinking a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA and a Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter.   Obviously they were freaking delicious because the pints disappeared immediately.   Oh, and because Von paid. Free alcohol is always good - Unless you're in a frat house after the age of 21. HAH!   As for the culinary delights, we only ordered a massive plate of nachos to keep the schwasted-ness at bay.  It was on-par with what I'd expect for bar food: Not horrible, not amazing, yet edible.  Good work, team, I'll be baaaaaaacccck!"}
{"text":"I went in here this evening at about 6:45.  At the front hostess stand were 3 attractive young women, who I assumed worked there. One was checking another patron in on some sort of a tablet device.  When she was done, she turned her back toward me, while another young women stared past me with a blank look.  I felt like I was crashing some sort of ASU sorority party.  After waiting several minutes without being acknowledged, I turned and left.  How is the food? I do not know.  I do not know the secret password or the special hand shake that is necessary to get a table.  By the way, I am 6foot 2 and a little hard to miss."}
{"text":"Met three friends here for VIP lunch (everything except alcohol was comped).  Service was OK (a little hiccup when server told us there was a limit of only ONE app, ONE entree, and ONE dessert & went to ask his manager when we asked him to confirm), but he came back apologizing about his mistake & told us we could order what we wanted, excluding alcohol.  Which brings me to bring up something that I thought was common sense-- if a place comps you something, then please make sure you tip your server!  If a place comps you EVERYTHING you've ordered (sodas, $10 apps, $15 salads and $13+ entrees; filet mignon was $29, AND $5+ desserts), then PLEASE tip 20%!  My four-item meal came to $56 before taxes, so I tipped our server $13 for my portion... The best part of this FREE multi-course lunch was that the food was very good!!  Well, what I had ordered anyway.  Bacon-Wrapped Dates- stuffed  w/ gorgonzola-cream cheese filling and wrapped in bacon.  There were chopped almonds inside, which added another layer of texture to the luscious chewy, yet creamy date and sweet and tangy gorgonzola cream cheese!  The salty-sweet combo was truly delectable & was the runaway winner of all the apps we ordered!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=1biMeepfC8QkBNV_einnWA#1biMeepfC8QkBNV_einnWA  Spicy mac 'n cheese- macaroni pasta w/ spicy Italian sausage, four cheeses (jack, cheddar, Swiss, parmesan), chipotle cream, red bell pepper, & scallions.  First few bites were dry and not tender enough, & we all wrote that off as a loss, until someone dug into the center and found the sweet spot!  SO, if you order this app, be sure to stir it well to distribute the cheesy-melted-goodness all throughout the bowl! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=Iuvrpz6K8-_uQi1oF16gpQ#Iuvrpz6K8-_uQi1oF16gpQ  Filet Mignon- wrapped in peppered bacon & then grilled w/ roasted garlic herb butter.  The steak was placed on a bed of delicious cheddar mashed potatoes & garnished w/ five grilled asparagus.  Cooked medium & was PERFECT!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=_opL4TOUoywHlkkL7t1KrQ#_opL4TOUoywHlkkL7t1KrQ  I would pay $29 & order this entree again!  Here's another look... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=G9AJNu9Sjq7YiTwQRzfo_A#G9AJNu9Sjq7YiTwQRzfo_A  ... and for dessert?  Creme brûlée!  Perfect crisped sugar topping and luscious creamy custard underneath.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=XD4Kd5hmVoX259bCPfUeSA#XD4Kd5hmVoX259bCPfUeSA  Friends ordered the following...  Charcuterie- came w/ four meats, one pate, a fig jam, ONE blue cheese (funny that there was only one cheese featured), crostini, cornichons, & a grainy mustard.  I only enjoyed the crostini, jam, & cheese.  Didn't care for the pate, nor the Italian sausage... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=mZuFr6QkCLZnv5j_4_Eucg#mZuFr6QkCLZnv5j_4_Eucg  Traditional Scotch Eggs- My first time trying these, & I enjoyed the textures!  Crispy-fried battered \"shell\" and perfectly-cooked hard-boiled eggs that were wrapped with thin-sliced pork.  Interesting & delicious, but I'd rather have a few more of those bacon-wrapped dates!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=vz6suZx9sUkNKZ_ZoMtB0A#vz6suZx9sUkNKZ_ZoMtB0A  Sauteed Brussels Sprouts- simple, & provided a great helping of veggies!  Loved the bacon bits!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=YFCbxkbrdxdFoZOgQMiwvQ#YFCbxkbrdxdFoZOgQMiwvQ  Kung Pao Chicken- a specialty entree I couldn't try, due to the sauce & peanuts.  Heard it was too salty.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=FpOCMHCiEqFaR_lDmqKARg#FpOCMHCiEqFaR_lDmqKARg  Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack- Don't know if friend enjoyed, and I didn't try it due to the corn tortillas.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=1mb-us3u7IlrEkbtOmcrtQ#1mb-us3u7IlrEkbtOmcrtQ  Seared Ahi Salad entree- Heard this was good.

{"text":"Food was great. Defitinely recommond their pizza. Lots of menu choices. Overall wait was a little long for not being very busy. All in all, nice vibe and good food."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion was a a great time. Our server Emily was very responsive and took great care of us.   I had the lamb burger on special and my fiancé got the chicken romano. The pretzels&cheese appetizer was good, but make sure you get the beer cheese on the side as well as the fondue"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable. I'm not sure what they've done to train their hostesses and staff, but we've never been treated better. Its always a gamble when you are dining out with children (ages 3 and 10 months) and you run the risk of being stuffed away in a corner, but our server at Thirsty Lion could not have been more sweet to our kids. She even let our son push the buttons on the computer that placed orders (not sure if its allowed, but we appreciated it.)  Flat screens all around allowed us to catch the NCAA March Madness - another nice feature.   The food was good. I had a sausage macaroni and cheese which carried a spicy kick. The salads were pretty good sized portions as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour prices on food! Everything we tried on the happy hour menu was delicious but the potato cakes are my favorite. I wish they had better Happy Hour deals on beers though"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever!  Great service and good WiFi connection. Upscale place for lunch. Been here a few times."}
{"text":"Great place, especially for the 80's kids. Played great music and brought me back to high school! Food is great as well. So why a four? I ordered no cheese and my order came out with cheese. HOWEVER, the waitress was great and took care of it!!! Now listening to Madonna!! Oh ya!"}
{"text":"Great food, energetic servers and a great atmosphere. I have already been here numerous times since they have opened and have not been disappointed with the staff or any items on the menu. With that being said, the beer and cheese soup all though tasty and delicious has made me sicker than a dog for several days.  Will definitley return again."}
{"text":"Lunch today was  last minute and right at lunch hour. I like Tempe Market Place, Overall I eat local..what can I say Tempe is a wonderful city to live in! I liked the atmosphere here, it is a  slightly upscale London  type pub but much larger. The dining area has tall padded booths around the sides and center area features wooden tables and chairs.  Large HD TVs all around the Pub but volume was off in dining area for lunch service.  It had a wide variety of items, also starters had some non generic items I cant wait to go back for. I like a good scotch egg :)  For Lunch we ordered  a 1/2 lb Cheeseburger and the Caprese Chicken Sandwich.  Both were excellent.  Cheeseburger had to be eaten with two hands. However not a fan of the fries.  Caprese Chicken Sandwich Grilled chicken breast, fresh mozzarella, vine ripe tomato, spicy pepperoni, sweet pepper tapenade, garlic pesto aioli, arugula and olive oil on grilled herb focaccia. was a delight to my mouth. It was large  and I was only able to eat half.  I had a side salad with  my sandwich and the balsamic dressing rocked my taste buds.   Will be back for happy hour  to chill with friends as Daily Imported Beer specials are  but $4!"}
{"text":"I had no idea that you could get such first rate food at a \"pub\".  My assumption was that you could only get \"pub food\", but my friends and I were dazzled by the menu and even more by the execution of the meals.  The salmon plate, the shrimp tacos and my orange chicken were all plated with such finesse.  And all were as equally impressed by the taste.    They also have a multitude of craft beers to choose from... both local and global.  The interior ambiance was excellent.  I think it would be fun to be seated in the front patio, but we were seated in the inner mall patio.  The ambiance here is not so great...feels like you are sitting in the malls food court.. so I recommend inside or front exterior patio.  The service was top notch.  Quick and often, and very personable."}
{"text":"Awesome food, had the Jalapeno burger, and everyone else had different burgers as well and all were delicious.   Server was attentive and knowledgeable.  Will be back"}
{"text":"BEST PUB EVER!!! I love the eclectic assemblage of this restaurant. It amazes me every time I go here that such a diverse group of customers can mingle, you have anyone from college age to senior citizens hanging out here.  The service is great!  My absolute favorite are the mojitos here, right now they have a Raspberry Mulejito, that has raspberries, rum, and ginger beer soooo good. I always have a designated driver so I can have three.   I've been here many many times, and all the food is excellent. It is really hard to have favorites, but I'm partial to the Bacon Wrapped Dates, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Fish and Chips, Fish Tacos, ughhh I could go on and on.... EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!!  TIP: Use Open Table to reserve a table for Friday and Saturday night ITS BUSY!! Dont be one of those idiots holding up the hostess or giving a restaurant a bad review for having a long wait when you didn't have the foresight to book a reservation. It's the weekend genius, it is going to be busy."}
{"text":"went here for a date on a Saturday night, needed a place to eat before we saw a movie at Harkins' theater. definitely glad we chose this over the other mall options. it was about 6pm and we didn't have to wait to be seated. when we were brought to our table, we were both surprised how big the restaurant extended back compared to what you can see walking through the mall. the server was super friendly and helpful. although they had a decent beer list, i personally didn't like the options and went with a standard Guinness. for dinner, i went with the quinoa black bean burger and it was sooo good. my date's RV burger was supposedly delicious as well. only took 1 star off due to the overpricing of menu options. but highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome selection! The service is really good, everyone is really friendly which sets the mood really well! The atmosphere is awesome with great design.  Specifically love the edename!  From happy hour to dinner! This place is a win!  Also totally reasonable price points!"}
{"text":"We hosted a company happy hour with about 40 people in attendance.  The service was great! The food was tasty! The drinks were terrific!  It was easy to set up and schedule and so as organizer, I was totally able to just sit back and enjoy.  Thanks to the great staff at the Thirsty Lion- a great time was had by all."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Some of the food is good, some are not.  And it's a hit or miss. Ordered the pretzel and cheese multiple times and first time was awesome, second crazy salty. Drinks are awesome!  First time I went was with a big group of family and we were embarrassed for the girl who served us... her shirt was sooo low cut it was obvious she was doing it for tips... kept bending down maybe oblivious of the situation?!  My husband says and said that day he feels bad for girls like that, shows they are not good waitress and that's the only way to get $$-poor taste.   Second time I went with friends- waitress  (had clothe on lol) and ironically enough amazing service but like I said cheese sauce was crazy salty. Other times were just 3 stars ok but not great.   Might go again.. if I am desperate and they are empty, and the girls fix their clothes   Not the best not the worst."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for lunch and loved it. A very spacious interior provides a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere quiet enough to talk without over hearing those around you. The restaurant was very clean and seemed to be a point they are proud of as well. I had the Italian Panini and a Lumberyard IPA. The panini was delicious and would recommend it. The have a good beer selection too. The service was timely and accurate and the prices were fair. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of place where one goes to relax and unwind with friends and family.The place is huge with a separate bar area and outdoor seating.They have live music on weekends. I loved the fact that the booths in the dinning area were huge and comfortable with the music being just right making this place perfect for a good conversation.The ambiance is cozy and feel good.The servers are friendly,food is fresh and you can select a bunch of options from their happy hour menu for $4-$6. We had the Pub Fries served with 3-peppercorn ranch dipping sauce $3.95 Crab & Seafood Cakes $5.95  (crab and salmon coated with panko bread crumbs served with chipotle aioli some marinated tomatoes and arugula).The cakes were good but i wish they had just Crab cakes. House margarita $4 pint of beer $4  The happy hour menu has a good variety of food options but the drinks are awfully limited. We also had the fish and chips(something i always order),they were served with fries and coleslaw. Overall a great place with free Valet.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Many thanks to the Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill for extending a free meal to the Yelp Eliters. My friend and I had the opportunity to visit their new Scottsdale Fashion Square location on Friday. The staff could not have been kinder or more accommodating. We enjoyed the beautiful day eating our lunch on their outdoor patio. I was impressed with their variety of appetizer and entree options. There are plenty of classic \"grease in your gut\" pub platters but they also have healthier selections if you're interested in keeping the caloric content down. We ordered the Grilled Fresh Artichoke and Shrimp Ceviche to start our meal off. The artichoke had a good taste - little chewy - but the crispy onion strings and aioli had great flavor. The shrimp ceviche was fresh, light, and had a little kick with just the right amount of lime. I will admit that it was tough to find the shrimp in the dish - tiny diced pieces vs good sized chunks. Next up was our main entrees - Cubano sandwich and the Black Bean and Quinoa Veggie Burger. My friend was able to perfectly sum up the Cubano, \"Excellent. Mustard and pickles made it; they're the key elements of a Cuban and they nailed it.\" The focaccia was crunchy on the outside and warm in the middle. My black bean burger was delicious. Red quinoa and black beans made it visually appealing while the burger was moist and chocked full of deliciousness. Great job pairing toppings because the avocado, smoked mozzarella, and sun dried tomato pesto were perfect accents to the burger.   It was a good meal and we walked away completely stuffed. Great ambiance and wait staff. TVs and outdoor seating along with spacious interiors make it a good option for group meet ups. Free parking right outside the doors. I would recommend that they extend their non-alcoholic drink options. Fresh brewed herbal teas and fresh lemonades would make a great option if you're not a big fan of soda, Minute Maid, or Lipton."}
{"text":"The food had so much flavor, loved it. We got the pub pretzel to share and a flight or sampler beers. For dinner I had crusted chicken on pasta. I was really impressed. Someone in our group had fish and chips and said it wasn't great (who orders fish when you live in the desert), and it was a loud environment. Overall, we had delicious food and a good experience."}
{"text":"We tried to go on Friday night only to be told that we couldn't get in without a reservation, although you could see quite a few open tables. I asked about making a reservation for Sunday at 11:30 and was told it was already full. The hostess was very rude.  I went home & made my reservation online no problem.  Sunday, the place was empty most of the time we were there, but they were turning people away unless they had a reservation. Ridiculous.  The food was ok, but maybe overpriced. They were out of the beer I wanted.  Overall, not really impressed & hope they improve after their first week open. Their staff could use a course in customer service. Even our waitress was very unfamiliar with the menu & drink selection.  Get it together."}
{"text":"Received a free lunch courtesy of Thirsty Lion. Thanks guys!  Stepped in and had an amazing array of various appetizers before our main entrees arrived. We shared the ahi tuna, Scotch eggs, and ceviche. The ceviche had a nice spicy kick to it and had a good balance of sweetness and acidity. The Scotch eggs were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were perfectly cooked, with a slightly runny, dark golden center and perfectly fried, providing a good balance of textures. The ahi was decent and came in a very generous portion.  I ordered the filet mignon ($28). It arrived with some grilled asparagus, perched on top of some mashed potatoes. The filet had lovely deep grill marks, Coated with a thin layer of butter. The server asked us to cut into the meat to make sure we were happy with the doneness (Medium rare), which I appreciated. The mashed potatoes were decent, and the asparagus was grilled nicely.  To gild the lily we ended our meal by sharing some creme brulée. It was a very rich concoction, packed with buttery taste. While the sugary, caramelized crystalline top was excellent the rest of the dessert was just a little runny.  Service was excellent and were checked on as needed.  This is definitely a good place to dine if you are at Scottsdale Fashion Square!"}
{"text":"52 different beers on tap!  In addition to the standard beers you'll find at any restaurant, they have several locally produced brews so that anyone searching for a beer to fit their taste will most likely find it.  I tried the White Chocolate Ale, which had a nicely toasted nut flavor with a white chocolate background, more of a refreshing light beer.  My friend tried some of it and remarked that if dessert beers ever existed, this would be one of them.  I'm not too much of a beer fan and the closest beer-like beverage I've enjoyed is lambic, but it did taste nice compared to other beers I've had.  We started with the scotch eggs, which were excellent.  The breading was nice and crispy, the pork sausage was flavorful and moist, and the eggs were perfectly cooked with a deep golden color to the yolks.  I had the vegetable panini for lunch, which was decent, albeit greasy.  The coleslaw I ordered with it was creamy but bland.  The menu itself has a weird mix of foods from different regions.  I was surprised to see orange chicken on the menu on a pub menu that seems to be focused more on pub-type food like fish and chips and scotch eggs."}
{"text":"Best service I have ever received. The food is great, the drinks are strong, and the overall evironment is relaxing. The manager is on top of things and ensures the guests are enjoying their time. I have for sure become a regular and will be returning many many more times. If you haven't gotten the chance to give Thirsty Lion a try, do yourself a favor and go immediately."}
{"text":"Best I can describe this place is spectacularly mediocre.  I read all the reviews about their fish and chips and figured I'd give it a shot.  I received 3 nice pieces of fish that probably needed a couple more minutes in the fryer as the breading was a tad on the gooey side yet.  The hand cut fries were good and mostly crisp.  I really wish someone in Arizona would start a cole slaw school because these guys need it.  It tasted like someone poured milk on a bowl of chopped cabbage.  Completely devoid of any flavor whatsoever.  I give them a 5 for cleanliness.  I sat at the rectangular bar and could see the floors under the sinks on the other side and they were spotless.  The service was nothing to speak of.  I mean that literally.  If you didn't wave at them, then you went without.  Actually they seemed quite fond of each other.  Just not the patrons paying for drinks and food.  It was a Saturday mid afternoon, so the bar wasn't even half full.  One decent bartender could handle it alone.  All in all it was a very forgettable experience which I was hoping would be a good one.  I had a ginger ale and the fish and chips which totaled $19.35.  Will keep on exploring for that elusive awesome fish fry!"}
{"text":"It was OK.   Some of the food was good, some was just OK.   There were a few good beers on the menu, but I felt like the beer selection was a little disappointing for a place that seems to pride itself on its beer menu.  I would go here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice, because it left me with the overall feeling of \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Huge place.  Cavernous even.  Lots of heavy, dark wood to give it a pub-like feel sans the intimate feeling of a neighborhood pub.  They have a full bar and tons of beers and wines to choose from.  There was a large food menu, though not a lot of choices for vegetarians.  We just had drinks and apps.  We had the beer cheese and the spinach dip with pretzels.  The pretzels were HUGE, like the size of my head!  The spinach dip was good and garlicky, but nothing to write home about.  The beer cheese was no bueno...and I really mean NO BUENO.  Bad enough that I actually complained about it to the server, who was not very sympathetic about serving something so rank.  Speaking of server, the service was a-ok.  I'm pretty sure he forgot about us a couple of times, but did a fine job when he was present.  The bathrooms are cool.  I would come back here, but not with any sense of urgency."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Lion's Pub.   Being a little older than there average clients, I enjoy that the staff treat me well.  The bar tender remembers my wife and my name even though she only served us once a couple of weeks earlier.  The selection of beers is great."}
{"text":"This is a tough one, I am in love with the atmosphere, their ahi tuna appetizer and their huge selection of beers and mixed drinks. However, if it wasn't for this last visit, this would have been a solid five, now, it's a two. Our bartender (we always sit the bar wherever we go) didn't think nor care we existed as warm bodies on this round planet. She ignored us, ignored us more and when she finally came over, she just dropped menus and walked away. The proper thing to do would have been to ask what we would like to drink and maybe a hello, that would have been nice. We had to ask to order drinks...AT A BAR, and had to ask to order our food. We ordered, no food for 27 minutes. Literally timed it. All we ordered was the pretzel app, ahi tuna app and the feature Irish menu potato cake things (that were awesome). When they finally came out, the pretzels were different than every other time we have came and the dips changed, or should I say cheese water and some sweet and sour plum sauce. So off. I asked about our cheese water as my boyfriend hated it since he wanted cheese, not watery stuff that was not cheesy, she said \"that's all we have\" and walked away. My boyfriend ordered another Makers and diet...never got it. Waters were empty and we asked to close out, she brought our bill back ten minutes later...he just handed her his card as we were done. She then goes \"oh I forgot your drink\" he said, \"don't worry about it, we are already done\" (twenty minutes wait time wise) she then said she needed to adjust our bill because she charged us for it but never made nor served it , but managed to charge us for it. This was not a busy time as the Cubs game was going but not near over. Bummer, severely disappointing for a place we love :("}
{"text":"My husband and I visited here yesterday and as it was on a prior visit, the service was great. The food was good as well. On a prior visit, which was my first time here before, my husband brought me here for the happy hour. I liked it then and decided that this would be one of my hangout spots. One of the things that I noticed yesterday is that they have a special for their house margaritas during the hottest times of year here. So although I missed their happy hour yesterday, I was still able to enjoy their house margaritas at a reduced price. BTW they were good! So if you are looking for a nice hangout spot and you have never been here before, it is worth a try. BTW, they also have other locations in the valley as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday.  Service was very fast and friendly.  I ordered the jalapeño burger and my colleague ordered the smoked turkey sandwich.  Reasonable prices.  Nice spot!  I recommend this place if you happen to be at  this mall."}
{"text":"Billie is an ahhmazing server.  Friendly,  quick with the best memory ever.   The manager name is super friendly too.  Great tasty food!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty neat! In the name you would assume it's like most divey pubs, but its not, it's a fancier restaurant/bar with 52 beers on tap and a nice food menu! Great location and atmosphere for a date night or to chill with friends! The only down side is, it's pretty pricey, for nothing special, burgers, pizza, calamari, things like that, the prices are up there. Yes there are 52 beers on tap, so it may be worth it if you're a beer person, if not.... meh... We went on a pretty busy night so I figured service would be a little hectic and slow, well they definitely showed me! Our waitresses were on the ball with everything, very quick, nice and professional. I am certainly interested in going back and trying a few other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Good selection of happy appetizers that are basically half price. Had the ban Minh sliders with very crispy calamari both were tasty. High noise levels like many of these type bar/restaurants."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. There was a 45 min wait to get a table and another 30 min wait to get our food. Once the food came out 2/4 of the orders were cold. They made it right by bringing us out something hot. Food was excellent when it was hot. I'd give it another try, despite the fair service/long waits."}
{"text":"My friends & I come into Thirsty Lion alllll the time for their orange chicken & artichoke dip! The passion fruit mojito is to die for! But of course, I always go back to see my favorite server Sam! Highly recommend Thirsty Lion to anyone that's hungry! The portions are huge!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at the thirsty lion! Burgers are amazing and the service was excellent! Jess was our server and gave some of the best service we have ever experienced. There are plenty of TV's and a very comfortable feel in here. I think we are going to come back and give the pub quiz a try on Wednesday. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Service was good food was really good. Had mac and cheese.  Bacon wrapped shrimp. Good place to cool and drink."}
{"text":"Nicely dinner!  Inside, it was kind of loud, so we moved outside. The waitress was very good and attentive. Food was great. I had the Thai Red Curry Chicken (without rice).  Yum!  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks late night on a Saturday. The drinks were delicious. The service was good. The atmosphere was fun at night time. The music got hopping at midnight with some old 2000s hip hop."}
{"text":"Not bad for a TGI Friday's sort flavor"}
{"text":"I was looking for an AZ Restaurant week restaurant in Gilbert and have always wanted to try this place. I made Opentable Sunday night, 7:00 dinner reservations for 3. Upon arrival the place was basically empty. Taylor our server introduced herself and was very efficient.  We ordered a Blood Orange Margarita and a Cucumber Rosemary Gin and Tonic while looking over the restaurant week menu. I noted that the RW menu at the restaurant was different than what was posted on the AZ Restaurant site. We ordered the Bacon BBQ Prawns, Tuna Poke Stack, Shrimp Pad Thai, Pork Tacos and the Smores Dessert cup. Our 3rd person in our group opted for the Orange Chicken. The food was OK. The Tuna Poke, BBQ shrimp and Orange Chicken were good. The Shrimp Pad Thai was Bland tasting, the Pork Taco were OK very salty especially the Black Beans.  My biggest \"pet peeve\" with this restaurant is the lack of prices on their Beer Selection (if anybodies noticed or cares). Prices noted on all hard liquor cocktails and wine. With restaurants jacking up beer/drink prices these days to accommodate the wage increase, I feel a slightly underhanded as a customer here. So assuming people are ordering beers that they like, not caring on the cost and they end up paying $$? for a beer which is outrages. I asked the Manager the cost of the 16oz. Santan Devils, he said it was $4.50 with a hesitation in his voice, clearly not what we were charged on our bill, $6. Thirsty Lion must have rolling beer prices, price of the day, hour, moment.  Atmosphere: Bar/Pub like, Service: very good, Food: very OK. Sorry to say I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally another great bar/pub restaurant in the San Tan Mall area.   I've been to the Thirsty Lion in Tempe plenty of times and have always had a pleasant experience and this location was no different. Not sure why the bad reviews. I would think people would expect long wait times when a place first opens.    I came in on a Sunday early afternoon and promptly found a seat at the bar (always my preferred seating location for day drinking =). Service was good and and bartender Natalie was friendly and helpful. Even recommending a few of her favorite drinks.   Day drinker beware. Drinks are pricey and will quickly add up as they are delicious and go down easy. Recommend the good ol'Moscow Mule. Great for these hot days ahead. But switch to beer as they are 9 a pop.   Was disappointed they didn't have the MLB package as it is sort of a sports bar with tvs all around, but not a deal breaker. I didn't eat this time around but can't imagine I'd be disappointed as everything else was on par with my expectations."}
{"text":"Love this place, but the service is a hit or miss..  Have been here a few times and I've had everything from stellar service, horrible service , and average service.  A little consistency would be nice but you roll the dice every time.   Yet I still come back because they have great beer choices and the food has always been excellent. Great place to watch a game or a little pre-game before rooting for THE DEVILS!!"}
{"text":"Holy CRAP how have I walked by this place week after week after week without knowing all the goodness it holds inside!  A little hesitant to go in at first due to seeing about 10 people waiting to be seated, but it was only a 10 minute wait so we did. Thank the food Gods. Not only do they take your name but your phone # and send you a text alert when they are ready to seat you. Genius. I didnt have to sit there if I wanted to shop more or wait in the cute seating area in the marketplace.  The Australian accented man seated us, and was quite funny in just the 60 seconds he was with us.  We shared a chicken entree with vegetables which was plenty for us and was BEYOND my expectations, so delicious (I cannot remember the entree but it it was in an olive oil type sauce with capers). We also shared the grilled artichoke appetizer (yum). I only wish they hadnt run out of their soup of the day (clam chowder) because Im sure that would have blown me away as well.  It was a bit loud in there but it seemed to mostly come from one large table that looked like may have been a christmas party and is to be expected this time of year and would not deter me from going back again.  I will be back...soon!"}
{"text":"First off, this location is at a very busy Mall, why you would give a low rating based on parking, is beyond me.    Awesome experiences every time. I had the salmon risotto and I LOVED IT. Made perfectly and it was well beyond what I expected. The staff was great for us. My wife and I were born days apart and we celebrate our birthdays together, so the staff made sure to make us feel like it was a big deal.   I also had a very tasty whiskey drink that I really enjoyed, thanks to our server for the advice.    Check this place out. It's usually kind of busy, but all great places are."}
{"text":"Friends invited us to the thirsty lion last night. Reading the reviews on yelp was informative, positive and left me uncertain as to what to expect. I will say the food was all delicious. The service I would give it an 8 on a scale of 1 - 10. Overall a positive experience. To bad the Packers lost against the cardinals that was the only disappointing part of the evening"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Place is pretty big, but our server never was too far away. Nice selection of craft beer n cocktails. The apps are pretty good too. They have a few locations in AZ and some in other western states. Great place to hit up for a couple drinks n apps before going to the airport."}
{"text":"On my travel project in Tempe, AZ on a Wed night went for dinner for my going away.  The place stays packed and they don't take reservations. Got there about 6:30 but before 7 for a party 5. They said the wait was about 15 mins or so.   There was definitely open tables as we walked the restaurant looking for the other half of our party; since we took 2 cars from the office and assume the 3 from our party were already there since they left earlier.  I went to the restroom and when I got back to the hostess stand they had already seated us at a booth.  Service and time to get our food was slow. I guess that was why there was lag time in seating us.  Food was piping hot coming out. My salmon dish with risotto was good for high end bar food. The salmon filet was not as thick as I would expect and the risotto was too heavy and the portion was huge.  The other salmon dish looked more colorful but the quinoa was too healthy. A carb dish between risotto and quinoa would have been better.  This is a small chain restaurant. They have 2 locations in Denver. I so happened to be in Downtown Denver and saw a Thirsty Lion. I googled it and they have 9 locations in total."}
{"text":"Empty on a Sat night and we know why (although to be fair, we were looking for something quiet, which this was). Walked past PACKED bars/restaurants in Fashion Square (Kona/Yard/Z Tejas) that obviously are much bigger hits than this.   One bartender for bar and bar area by patio (Zach). Very slow service. He's not fast or efficient and needs which compounds the problem. I also put this on management for either the staffing and/or layout of bars, point of sale terminals (which he spends way too much time doing). Doesn't clean off bar, every customer needs something constantly.  It's not clear on beer list what beers are served in a pint glass or a tulip.  Pet peeve - no beer prices on menu. Why? Because they're very pricey.   Bartender said reverse happy hour starts at 10:30pm but menu says 9:30pm 7 days a week. Need to give accurate info (He had to check the computer to see). It does start at 9:30pm.  Coors Light pint is $4 on HH? And only one other beer on HH? Lame! Plus, way too much head on the beer pours.  They do have a lot of HH food options. Brussels sprouts good. Kale salad was small and had almost nothing but Kale on it, despite menu description.  Wasting a HUGE TV behind the bar with music videos.  The other two are showing a replay of an NFL game. Meanwhile there's a Cubs Dodgers MLB game being played (But not shown on any TVs here). Boo.   Who I think was the manager (only one wearing white shirt) was surly in response to a simple/friendly question and answered while he kept walking away from us. Front bartender Chris was not friendly.  As it gets closer to closing time (midnight) you will start to see more hustle by the staff than you've seen all night - they are all just dying to close up shop, and make it very obvious to anyone left after 11pm (which is not many). Guess we all just can't wait to leave.  This place won't make it without changes."}
{"text":"No prices on beer list. This is simply inexcusable. Even bartenders don't know how much a particular beer costs - they have to go look it up on the computer.  Second, they do not turn TV sound on for games unless it's a Cards football game.  Happy hour discount on beer is only $1 off.  $5 for a 12oz bottle of O'Douls is very steep."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim with low expectations. I can't believe how good it was! We ordered bacon covered dates and Brussels sprouts. Then had the kale salad. Everything was incredible."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to drop by for a quick lunch.  Cobb salad was pretty good but had a bit too much dressing and the music level is geared more towards an evening atmosphere vs. lunch."}
{"text":"Best bar in town. Food was great but I have to say our bartender made the night for us best drinks and great conversation thanks for a awesome experience Bridgette !she goes by \"Smig\". We will be back"}
{"text":"Really Kool place.  Super clean delicious food. .   If Waikiki Beach was right outside of this place it would simulate yard house in Honolulu"}
{"text":"I came here on the invitation of Thirsty Lion to have a complimentary meal, and I would definitely go back as a paying customer! The place is huge and great for after work happy hours! We had the pretzel to share and it stayed soft the whole time, which I admit was not long because it was so good! I had a salad for lunch, and it was fresh and flavorful. I had a bite of my husband's panini and it was full of meat and very hearty. The decor is interesting, kind of piece-mealed together, but whatever. We still had a great time and the service was good, too."}
{"text":"So I was trying to get into this place. But there was a limit on the number of people allowed here since the last soccer game was on. The lady was a bit snippy in the way she turned customers down. She could've been more friendly. My friends already had a table reserved with 2 empty seats waiting for us. Finally after talking to the manager and having to show him the 2 empty reserved seats, we got to enjoy the ambiance.   The place looks inviting. The server made up for the poor introduction to the place. The server was excellent- friendly, quick, and responsive! Thank you! Then I had hot coffee with a warm blackberry cobbler. I thought I was going to get a slice, but I was pleasantly surprised with a cute individual mini pie. It was sooo good!"}
{"text":"Good place to have a drink and watch a game. The food is terrible. We had the Scottish eggs which were completely bland and the spinach dip was very oily.  The beer and drink selection is plentiful and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"WHY IS THE MUSIC SO LOUD!?!!!??!!  At 5PM on a Wednesday, I can't even have a nice conversation with a friend.   Just can't go there ever again."}
{"text":"Tried two appetizers for lunch, calamari and scotch eggs. Both were prepared excellently. it's amazing how many restaurants overcook calamari, not a problem here. These were done to perfection. The scotch eggs were cooked just right with a slightly soft yolk. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good pub food and great selection of alcohol.  If you are looking for a ton of beers and spirits, it's the spot for you.  Food was OK, tons of pepper.  I have had some fabulous flatbreads.  Chicken tenderloin was white meat chicken and tasty, a little overdone, but still great.  Fries were good.  Definitely a good spot to meet friends and have some drinks."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic experience.  The grilled artichoke with garlic butter was to die for! My wife had the Ginger Tag Grilled Shrimp Salad and I had the French Dip that was anything but usual.  Screaming delicious food.  Our waiter,  Dragon from Croatia, was attentive, personable and took care of our every need. A wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion, located in Fashion Square is a great place to grab lunch or dinner while out shopping. Reminds me of an old world gastro pub. Somthing reminiscent of an English pub.   Full bar and multiple flat screens makes this a good place to catch a game while you are out at the mall, before or after catching a movie.  The menu is pretty deep, and they usually run drink specials (half price) for when the outside temp reaches 105 degrees."}
{"text":"Good food with lots of variety.  Scratch kitchen allows easy modifications.  Not great for business lunches as it is loud but manageable."}
{"text":"Had the Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and veggies, Excellent dish.  Drinks were outstanding as well as service and atmosphere.  We had a great experience overall and totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. I made a reservation for my husbands birthday for a party of 5. They had a table set up when we got there. They even gave him a free dessert and a card signed by the waitstaff.  We have never had a bad meal and have been there 3 times now."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on Sunday around 6:30pm to check it out since we'd visited the Tempe location last month for my birthday and had a great time there. At the Tempe location we had great service, food, and awesome happy hour margaritas and we were so excited that a location had opened in Gilbert. This time, we sat outside on the patio and our service was okay but not great. Inside looked like it was super packed. He ordered a margarita and a Cuban sandwich. I ordered the hazelnut strawberry salad and a flavored margarita. My drink was okay but his margarita tasted like lemon water; flavorless, weak, and watered down. His food was nothing to rave about either. My salad was flavorless and I even had to request salt to give it some flavor. We felt so let down. We were so excited and left so disappointed. Maybe we'll give a few more tries or just make the trip to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on Sunday during happy hour for my birthday and had a great time there. We had great service, food, and awesome happy hour margaritas. We had a party of 10 people and everyone was happy with their drinks and food. The food was delicious and they have many options for happy hour. The margaritas tasted homemade and had a good kick to them. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Tempe Marketplace. I had the opportunity of trying the Veggie Panini and the American Burger...Both were super good! I was surprised by the quality of their food, I am not usually a fan of bar food but this was great quality.   -Great food -Huge restaurant/bar -indoor and outdoor seating -Good for groups - Extensive Late night happy hour (food and drinks) -Good Customer Service"}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Saturday night for reverse happy hour. It was around 10:30 when we sat down. Note, there were lots of empty tables, it was not by any means crowded. We ordered drinks and appetizers only. The first round of drinks came out relatively quick. The food on the other hand took at least 30 minutes for just two appetizers! I ordered a beer after that and that took 15-20 minutes to get to the table. Our waitress was nice enough but scarce. Overall the food and drinks were decent, but the service was lacking on many levels."}
{"text":"Met my sister at this restaurant because she had a Groupon. A Groupon got us in the door, great food & service will get us back. The Australian Manager came by and checked on our experience...told him we loved the place. I would highly recommend this restaurant, because the menu has a diverse selection and has something for everyone."}
{"text":"We have had amazing experiences everytime we dined here.  The Manager Eric sets a perfect example of how a manager should lead his staff.  Tonight, we saw him directing, cleaning and cordinating.... or what we can say-\"leading by example\".  The staff was very friendly, the food was great and even worked in their own mini heirchy to teamwork.   The food: great!  We enjoyed happy hour items, their pizza and a burger.  The food has always been great here but I was compelled to write a review as I was inspired how the staff came together to service their loyal customers."}
{"text":"Let me just begin with how much I enjoy food.  Especially when I receive a complimentary meal.  I was one of the lucky ones to be able to have lunch here after I received a Yelp Elite invitation that came directly from Thirsty Lion to our wonderful community manager Lindsey.  I rsvp'd as directed and Alyssa Shelton was very accommodating with my schedule.  She reserved me a table for two.    When we arrived I stated to the hostess that I was here by Yelp invitation and they knew exactly what I was referring to.  After getting seated I asked our waitress what the details and or restrictions were for my invite.  She confirmed with the manager that anything I ordered would be on the house.  I jokingly said \"one of everything on the menu then!\"  I didn't ask if alcoholic beverages were included since I did have to return to my place of work after lunch.  Appetizer:  You can't go wrong with the oven baked soft pretzel.  Soft and buttery with a side of horseradish mustard I believe.  Entree:  I ordered the pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage with four cheese blend pizza.  It was as delicious as it sounds I promise.  My wife ordered the Brussels sprouts quinoa with chicken salad.  Tasted fresh and it was amaze-balls!  We also ordered a side of fries to treat our glutinous appetite.  No desserts, but I sure did want to taste them all.  Service was great and I even asked our waitress to charge my card for something so that I could leave her the 20% tip she earned from the total bill.  Overall the location is great.  I can see it getting very busy on weekends and it's also very spacious.  Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I'm in Scottsdale in a business trip and my co-workers took me to this pub for dinner, drinks and to watch the game. There was a long wait because of the restaurant specials and the playoffs were on.  Once we were seated the service and the food was great. The vibe and atmosphere was awesome. I recommend this place whether it's to hang out or watch the game. Can't go wrong with their food options either."}
{"text":"I come here a lot just for the excellent food. I tried the happy hour and it was decent but nothing that blew my mind away. My only point of contention is that the staff needs to know more about the liquor selection. I specifically asked for Strongbow Cider and the waiter said all they had was some other cider. I shrugged it off and ordered something else. However the next time I was in there the service was a little slower (to be fair it was busy) and I read every single beer they had on their menu and to my surprise they had bottled Strongbow! Grrrr... However I love the food it has yet to dissapoint so I will continue coming!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with family and we were able to get a table right away at around 8pm...this was a great surprise! Had the king pao chicken, which was surprisingly solid. I'd recommend this place to anyone who doesn't know what they want for dinner, since they have EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"SCOTCH SCOTCH SCOTCH, I LOVE SCOTCH.. eggs that is!  Not only does this place have a great beer selection, it also has great food you may not find anywhere else (unless you are a food junkie)"}
{"text":"Believe the three star rating. We decided to give it a try even though reviews weren't stellar. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Food is genuinely JUST OK. there is nothing special here and it's also not cheap enough to be not special. Out of the 6 dishes we had and three appetizers there was not one unique and well executed item. Everything really is bland. They need an investment in seasoning and spices it seems. Also, prepare to wait 15 minutes for bar drinks on busy nights. Overall, I'm glad I tried it, but I can think of at least 20 other places I'd rather eat at or try before I ever go back here."}
{"text":"Visited Friday,  Feb 10, 2017 for business lunch.  Had a wonderful experience.  Kitchen was out of the menu item I ordered, salmon cakes.  Our server,  BJ,  and the restaurant manager went above and beyond to accomodate me because of the slight delay in lunch. I was happily surprised,  they didn't have to,  but they did.  Served me a soup of my choice (free) until the food was freshly made and they kept checking on us. In another restaurant I would have just been informed of the delay. This wss my first time to this particular location. Will definitely be back. P. S.  the food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour at this location.. on a Tuesday .. service was good .. we shared some appetizers and enjoyed the beat the heat drink special  The pear and prosciutto flatbread was good, light and flavorful .. the calamari looked a little pale but was fried just right .. light and flaky.. the French fries were all random lengths and shapes and greasy (no bueno)..   We finished it off with a strawberry rhubarb white chocolate cheesecake .. this was yummy.. not a lot of the strawberry rhubarb but the white chocolate with cheesecake .. so good.    Great happy hour specials.. good service .. easy to park.. close to the movie theater before or after a show."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch meeting spot .. there's something on the menu for everybody. Today's lunch took longer then usual but they kept the drinks coming and we weren't in a rush.  The salads here are the perfect size for lunch.. just enough food so you're not stuffed.  I always have the ahi tuna salad .. today I had the steak salad with Gorgonzola cheese.. very good .. steak was med-well.. we shared an order of the spinach dip with pita chips.. seasoned well.."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  I had the fish and chips.  I think their fish and chips just might be the best in the Phoenix vicinity!  And our was server Molly.  Great personality! Very helpful! Made us feel right at home in her section.  And lastly, Shawn, one of the managers there from down under.  Very personable!!!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy place to go before the movies!  The menu is quite diverse.  We stayed with starters because there were so many to try.! My favorites- grilled artichoke and grilled ahi.  Also had calamari and soup.  The drinks were good, the beer was cold, service was great!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Had the orange chicken and the blood orange margarita, they were both excellent. Husband had the poke bowl and he enjoyed it. Service was great. If you're planning on going on a busy night, make a reservation. Totally worth the little bit of effort it takes."}
{"text":"We have had bad food and bad service everytime we've gone.   Even just sitting at the bar for a beer is frustrating to place an order and get refills.  We avoid Thirsty Lion at all costs."}
{"text":"Awful. Sat there for 30 minutes and no one waited on us! I heard it was horrible service but now I have seen it. And when we told them how bad the waitress yells at us. We just left now."}
{"text":"This location is right by our house and we are happy about it! Thirsty Lion is a fancy place that bolsters a bar atmosphere with great food and drinks. We stopped by for a quick dinner and a beer and will be back again.   Service here was really friendly and on point. It wasn't too busy when we went there so everything came from the kitchen really quick. I got the cubano with fries and it was awesome! My friend got the mac n cheese and he also really enjoyed it.   This place is also right in the San Tan Village Mall area so there are a ton of places to shop and a few dessert places to head to as well if you want to walk off your food and drinks for a bit. It's also right by the 202 Fwy so convenient and easy to get to. Parking can be a pain sometimes if it is a busy night due to all the shoppers around."}
{"text":"So very happy that the Gilbert location is open and judging by the crowds... So is everyone else. Okay the food is very good and creative. Servers are awesome and the bartenders are quick to make you smile. The chicken tenders are so flavorful you don't even need the dipping sauces. We had the pear and prosciutto flatbread which is great. Only disappointment was they ran out of Left hand milk stout. The bar manager actually came over to our table and apologized. That was really unexpected and a nice touch. They have an open kitchen and I love that. We also had the stuffed dates(very sweet) but they were good. We will return again and again. Tempe drive was too much and again so glad they are here!!!!! Still in love  service is awesome. They really work hard to make sure you are happy.  Now tried the edamame and Cuban sandwich  both very good with a side salad. Tonight we tried the Ruben and WOW it is outstanding.  Okay easy to say this place has become our new favorite. The waitstaff really go the extra mile to make sure you are happy. Sitting at the bar and enjoying the floor show. Happy hour is wonderful. Just have to call out Bree, Brooke and Nicole for great service, pleasant company and attention to details. Tonight we are trying the green chile chicken sandwich. Being from New Mexico we are a little bias on green chile. Okay, honest, little bits.... Would be so much better with whole pieces. Okay flavor, still like the Cuban and Ruben better."}
{"text":"Best cobb salad ever. Hands down. The spinach artichoke dip is amazing too. I'd take a picture of it but it's gone. Lol Whoops. That's the kung pao chicken in the background. Hubs says it's amazing and actually TRULY spicy."}
{"text":"Best cobb salad ever. Lol I've been to The Thirsty Lion twice now (first in Scottsdale and today in Tempe) and ever since the first time a week ago, I've been craving this salad! The pretzel was delish too. Hubs said the burger was great. He had the Kung Pao Chicken the first time and said it was awesome. Oh, the scotch eggs are great too."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I WILL for sure be coming back!!! We had a party of 20 and we only waited 45 minutes on a busy Friday night! The servers were on point and the food was absolutely delicious! The food came out warm and no complaints! All the cocktails & beer were great!!!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss - beer selection is decent - food is average.  The convenience lies in the location."}
{"text":"In a word, I'd describe this place as \"meh\"  Meaning, if a group was deciding where to go and someone suggested it - I'd go along without complaints but I don't know that I'd suggest it myself.    On the positives, the place is huge, and we've never had an issue getting a table.  The beer list is also somewhat large by normal standards - but in the new arena of extensive beer lists through the PHX metro area (OHSO, Angels Trumpet, etc etc) I wish that they'd stock more beers from the craft side in lieu of major semi-household names.  Food is ok, service is hit or miss.  Again, if it's suggested - I'll certainly come here again it just may not be my idea."}
{"text":"Three months ago I would have rated this 5 stars.   Went there today for the Happy Hour that I used to enjoy so much.  Menu has changed.  The BBQ pork slider which was the best in town is no longer served. I ordered the pizza which was soggy and not that good. My friend ordered the pretzel which was completely different.  The dough is not the same and the dipping sauce was thinner. Beef sliders also changed.  They are now quite a bit smaller I guess this will be our last trip to this restaurant.  It was good while it lasted.  Why change a good thing?"}
{"text":"I had an overall good time but the food was just okay (if that). I ordered the spicy mac and cheese but the macaroni was overcooked and the sauce was really bland.  My bf ordered the romano herb chicken and the chicken was like rubber, it even held a crunch! So weird! The wait staff was really nice though and the atmosphere was fun. My advice if you come here, is to skip the food, and just get full of the alcohol."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Kailie was our bartender and server.   Just wonderful.  Food was excellent.  Great service.  A+ Thank you"}
{"text":"Food and service were good mid day.  A bit commercialized, but I accept that."}
{"text":"Service is slow and the food just sits out forever on the counter. We were in a hurry. We asked the server to box our food for us so we could catch our bus. The guy rudely said, \"I don't think the busses will leave without you.\" Our server was Mark C. When we got our food, I tried it before I left. Most of my food was cold and felt like it had been sitting. After working in food service for most of my high school and college career, they aren't doing it right. Use trays. Servers shouldn't weave between tables. Bring food out together in an organized fashion. I watched an entire half of a Barclays Premier League Soccer match waiting for my food. I watched servers look at the food ready to go baffled as it sits on the counter ready to go.   The atmosphere is great. If they fix the service, then they will have something here, but until then. Don't go."}
{"text":"The food was great!!  Had the Fish Tacos and really liked that they werent breaded and were filling too.   Friend said the fish and chips were really good as well.   Service was great!!  Hilary and Lauren had excellent  advice on drink  and food selections and provided great service.  For being open only 9 days, I was very impressed and they seemed to really have it together.  In other reviews there was mention of being \"cut off at 4 beers\".  I inquired if there was a cut off rule of sorts and they advised only if a patron is under the influence and needs to be.  I too had the same outstanding service as Albert and too was asked my name, by the staff (Hilary and Lauren) and also the owner.    The atmoshpere was nice, wasn't too loud and could carry a business conversation, which is often hard to do in establishments such as this.  I had a great experience here and will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Extremely diverse menu. Great beer selection. Highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"This place would be much better if they could pick a style of food and stick with it.  They are way to much like Cheesecake Factory were you have way to many choices.  My advice is to pick something you do well and stick with it instead of offering everything from steak to pizza to sushi.  They do have some cool offers for movie and a pizza during the week that might be worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love the Thirsty Lion!! I've been to every location and they are all great! Beer selection is fantastic. Charcuterie board was awesome. Best part - service! Tara the bartender was friendly and fun. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Tempe Marketplace, I make it a point to stop in here. Fantastic beer selection and great food!The main reason I keep coming back though is the impeccable service. The bartender Johncie is amazing at her craft and always remembers us and our drink choices. The manager Sean is equally gracious and welcoming. I highly recommend trying out The Thirsty Lion if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"I went here again and tried the Chicken Caprese Sandwich.  It was great!  Make sure you have the bread toasted or it will get gummy as you eat it.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Typical corporate fare, fried everything, no different than any other chain, the Fish tacos were particularly horrible, just a soggy mess with some sort of fish buried in there somewhere. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high but I was really disappointed. Basically has the feel and vibe of just another chain restaurant along the lines of say a BJ's or TGI Fridays. I agree a lot with Les L review. They are trying to be a fake beer bar by having a lot of taps, sadly there really wasn't anything special on their 40 or so taps that you can't get at the grocery store. The food itself was pretty lifeless. Also had the feel and look of chain restaurant mass produced food. The service was ok and also atypical of a chain restaurant. Lifeless and no personality."}
{"text":"This was alright for pub food, the place was loud and not very pub like. If you are looking for American bland chain food this is your place."}
{"text":"Its a 500 chair, chain restaurant rather than the smaller kind of place that I had imagined so I had to adjust expectations. The spicy burger wasn't that spicy but it was absolutely delicious and it was huge. The patio was a warm, beautiful place to hang out. The service was just about perfect and the cider went down very easy. I wasn't originally expecting to eat in a large shopping center but the late hour and the lack of customers made for a slower pace and I genuinely enjoyed my time there."}
{"text":"Great Pub.  Good food cold beer...really enjoyed it....great selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great looking staff, I mean really great looking staff. Both male and female. But what was even better the staff was super friendly, attentive, and extremely competent. Nice happy hour deals ."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there on Friday evening, the server Amanda was excellent, she had a way of making you laugh and great suggestions. The food was very up to par. The atmosphere is upscale bar but casual. Outdoor seating was preferred!  I highly suggest the Ahi Tuna."}
{"text":"Giving this place 3 stars because our poor experience directly correlated with our food choices. We ordered the charcuterie board to start, which was a huge mistake. I mistakenly read \"Gastropub\" on the wall and believed it, thinking we would get a charcuterie board like one from Culinary Dropout or other gastropubs. This was a disgusting option. The only cheese was a bleu cheese and the meat was so salty and one was something that can only be described as potted meat from a can. Do not try this appetizer.   The burger and fries we ordered were okay. Not amazing, not horrible.   The service was sub-par. Our waitress barely visited our table and when she did, she seemed uninterested in us or providing us service. I couldn't even get my water glass filled.   I'm sure the food here is better when ordering more bar/pub food. But if I want bar food, I would rather go to a bar, where it's a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"They have Bells Oberon on tap here!! Get it while you can you guys!!   We got here jus in time for the happy hour menu which was perfect. My friend and I shared the potato cakes, sliders, fries, and soft pretzel. The sliders and fries were so good! We honestly probably would have been full if we had jus stuck with that but the other two items were pretty decent also. Next time id like to get there in time for the fancy menu!!!"}
{"text":"I really had been wanting to try the Thirsty Lion and I was so glad that I finally did last week. I loved the atmosphere and the food was delish.  My waitress, I think Emily, was so sweet and attentive. I will def be coming back and can't wait to eat the soup again!"}
{"text":"Thirsty Lions is located inside the Scottsdale Mall, it has a very intimate Irish feel to it. It's spacious and has a nice size bar area. There happy hour pizza is a decent size and taste pretty good, cheesy. They have a good happy hour menu & sometimes they will give you a movie/meal deal for a good price. Pretty chill spot to visit & to have a nice little drink at."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I go to this restaurant almost too often. It is delicious! There are so many different options, everyone can find something. I have yet to try something I have not enjoyed. Service is always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Slow service, subpar food and while our waitress wasn't exactly rude, she wasn't exactly nice.   My kids hated their food from the kids menu and barely ate it.   It was empty in the place and still it took forever for our waitress to even come to our table first time around and then every subsequent time. To get napkins I had to go to the bar, to ask for more water, I had to go to the bar. To pay the bill....you get the idea. Blah."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night as part of a group of 8.  We got there around 8:30pm and was told it would be bout a 40 minute wait, which is understandable since our party was so large.  We only wanted drinks though so we asked if we could it on the empty patio.  They have fans and misters, so hey why not.  The hostess gladly sat us but I guess there was some miscommunication between the hostess and the server because our server was pisssssssssssed.  And she made it known too.  I think she asked us at least five times whether we sat ourselves or if we went through the hostess.... Super lame and she totally made us feel unwanted.  The food and drinks are your standard bar food, probably a notch better.  Don't get the spicy tuna roll.  Really heavy on the rice - it reminded me of those per-packaged rolls you get at trader joes."}
{"text":"Dependable! Great Food and Drinks!  I've been here a few times so far. Just recently, they changed their menu, adding new things and taking away a few others. I enjoy how they are trying new things to help make their menu stand out.  My most recent visit here, I got the classic reuben, which was soooo delicious! I'd recommend that sandwich for sure. For beer, my go to is the fresh squeezed IPA, and for cocktails, I really enjoy the grapefruit basil martini. My friends had the chicken nachos, which is huge! My other friend got a Cubano. He wasn't a fan, primarily because cuban sandwiches are usually pressed, and they don't press their Cubanos.   They also have tv's, to watch the games. The staff are attentive and everytime I've been, I've always enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"It's a good place for lunch or dinner if you're out shopping or in a hurry to catch a movie at Fashion Square. A little brighter and cleaner than your average bar, but it's in a busy mall. Not bad."}
{"text":"They close at twelve without announcing any sort of last call. This place is more like cut-off lion taxidermy.   But I digress. They were out of fish cakes and I demand to know why. I shall return and inquire with in. And drink more of that Papago Orange beer. I shall. Just try and stop me. I had tuna sushi roll and instead of shredded chunk I got high quality cuts. Major boon so unsuspecting! The fries squid was alright. Not the greatest but in no way bad. I'd say like an Italian style than Asian (nothing wrong with that).  Otherwise this is a very nice late night spot with nice happy hour deals."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!   Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the \"peacemakers\" were before us!    Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!  Bravo Thirsty Lion!"}
{"text":"Was at Scottsdale Fashion Square this morning so stopped at the Thirsty Lion for lunch.  Had a Fried Chicken Sandwich with a side salad.  It was very good.  It was such a large sandwich it needed a knife, rather than a toothpick, to hold it together.  Like King Arthur with Excalibur, I drew the knife out of the sandwich before eating it.  Some of my friends have suggested the knife was stuck in the sandwich in case someone wanted to cut their sandwich into smaller pieces to eat.  Fortunately my mouth is big enough I was able to eat the sandwich without having to cut it into smaller pieces.  Noticed another good thing while there.  The wines that are available by the glass are available in two different sizes.  If I hadn't been driving right after lunch would have ordered a glass of wine (the smaller size) while at the Thirsty Lion."}
{"text":"I was here last weekend for the first time to watch a COPA America match with my boyfriend.  I ordered the grilled pear a prosciutto flatbread with four cheeses, grilled pear slices, arugula and candied hazelnuts, and in keeping with my pear theme I had a pear martini to wash it all down and I have to genuinely say that my whole dinner was genuinely delicious!  The patrons around us seemed to be having a nice time, the ambience was upscale and beautiful, and the service was timely and friendly.  I can say with confidence that we will return soon."}
{"text":"We came here for a holiday party, and the staff was awesome. Food came out pretty bad.... I've been to other locations and food has always been pretty good, but not that night. Also, I couldn't find a sitter this night so I had my one year old son with me who is still in diapers. They have plenty of high chairs for kids to come to the restaurant, but they don't have a changing table in the restrooms. I had to take my kid out to the car to be able to change him. If you welcome kids put some changing tables in your restrooms. That's my reason for low review."}
{"text":"Pretty fun atmosphere... Especially during March madness. I highly recommend the salmon and asparagus and nachos as an appetizer. We got the reuben as well but probably wouldn't get it again.. Oh and the bubbles was amazing... The service was average but the food and atmosphere was worth it!!"}
{"text":"Seems to be a popular place, but I'm not a big fan. Have been here several times with large groups.  Food has always seemed like it has sat out for awhile and not fresh. Great beer selection though so it's a good spot to grab a cold beverage."}
{"text":"First time eating at Thirsty Lion.  Good service, good food, large portions.  The restaurant has a really fun atmosphere.  We tried the spinach and artichoke dip and the pretzels and beer cheese.  Both were good - the beer cheese was very hoppy -  but the pretzels and the spinach dip were awesome.  Had the fish and chips - pretty typical.  My friend had the fish tacos - big portions and they were tasty.    Definitely a fun place to go for a fun night or to watch football games."}
{"text":"Ordered beverages and apps with my wife at the bar. Did not expect that my Coors Light would be served - still tinted green, left over from St. Patrick's Day almost a week past. Server said \"we're still in the St. Patty's Day mood around here\". Green foam and all. Tasted bad. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Great experience today. Very helpful and lots of staff helping us out. There was a slight issue with the food but promptly remade it and all was good. Kudos to Jamian for being prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Granted, I've only tried their spinach&artichoke dip and their fish&chips, but golly both of those are DELICIOUS. They've got a great drinks selection, and the dining setting is really unique and welcoming. They've got loads of TVs, so it's got a cool sports-bar feel, but more restaurant-y if that makes any sense.  I need to check out their happy hour as it includes a GIANT chunk of their menu at a great rate!   Also they've got an agreement with the movie theater in the center. On Mondays, you can get a brick-oven pizza of your choice (normally 11.95-12.95), two non-alcoholic beverages, and two Harkins Theatres tickets for ONLY $19.95! If you're going to a Monday movie, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"This is a casual, yet sophisticated place to eat. We got the corned beef, a traditional pub entree, quinoa black bean burger as well as the Scotch eggs, which were all equally delicious. But I highly recommend the Scotch eggs because it's so unique!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch, the jalapeño burger was excellent! The patio is a great location to enjoy the weather and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. Had the bacon wrapped dates and scotch eggs appetizers (AMAZING!!!) but due to some snafu in the kitchen (some orders were lost apparently), we waited somewhere between 45 and 60 minutes for our dinners. The food was absolutely wonderful, no question. Because we waited so long for dinner, they comped our dinners, then eventually the whole thing. It was nice though, that we didn't have to ask. Ashley was our waitress and super nice. She apologized like crazy for what happened, but we know it has nothing to do with her. The food was beyond incredible, and so was the staff, but not entirely sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"At first I was upset with my server because I felt we weren't getting the best service. It was my sisters bday and we made reservations and they knew we'd be in. They did nothing to prepare for us coming. We got there and they set us down and it took 20 mins for us to even get a server, and extra 30 mins to get a drink. Also I ordered food and everyone else got there food and I never even got mine. The kitchen failed to make it, and by the time the server came back everyone was already done with their food. I got very upset with the server and by then I realized it wasn't her fault, she tried to do her absolute best. She had so many tables and parties and her manager knew that and hadn't helped at all, and that was probably the worst part. I can't fault a server for giving me their 100%, but when management fails to realize their servers tanking, and your sitting and talking, I think that's says a lot about the restaurant and management. We talked with the General Manager but I honestly I don't even think he cared. He just comped the entire tab and I think that annoyed me more, because that's not what I was looking for. I was simply there to celebrate my sisters birthday. And I'm a server so I know how that the industries works and it was just bad there."}
{"text":"Coming from a person that is really picky and critical, the fact that I really like this place is impressive even to me! Happy Hour menu never fails to disappoint."}
{"text":"I had no clue that lunch on a Wednesday would have a wait but its funny to see everyone in the entrance area waiting on a friend as everyone was doing the same (like me) that day.   Overall atmosphere is great with a vibrant social scene. I try to steer away from alcohol during the day when I'm returning to the office but they have plenty of beers on tap... hence the word 'thirsty' in the name!!!   Lots of choices especially with the summer specialty menu, but kept it simple and order the same as my buddy... the bacon burger with onion ring and side of fries... all good stuff. Service was good and what appeared to be one of the managers checked on us just to make sure everything went smooth which we appreciated as they were busy!   Come correct as everyone is people watching... just when look to the left to check out someone, someone is probably checking you out!! Haha.  Good location and good food. When the temps hit 102, Moscow Mules are on special so hopefully we have 1 more heat wave so I can return and take advantage."}
{"text":"We have been to this Thirsty Lion several times and have had both lunch and dinner services. The food is always as ordered (...I have food allergy/sensitivity restrictions) and the menu has something for everyone. If you're going here for dinner on a weekend night, plan on a 20-30 minute wait. It's worth the wait though! Plenty of patio seating too!"}
{"text":"Chose this place out of necessity - someone in our group was hangry - but had a really good experience. We were seated promptly and helped with suggestions on the menu. We enjoyed the edamame, pork sliders, fish and chips, pear flatbread and a couple of fresh salads. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been exploring the extensive restaurants offering at Tempe Marketplace since I recently moved close by. We had drove by Thirsty Lion Club the day before,and was attracted by the curb appeal. We decided to go there for lunch before I dropped him off at the airport. We walked in , and were greeted by the hostess and a server. Our server's name was Shannon and she was a sweetheart. She was attentive and friendly. We ordered the shrimp ceviche from seasonal summer menu. It was my boyfriends first time trying it and he enjoyed it. It was pretty tasty, however it was hard to scoop because it was in a small glass. However, we ended up dumping it on the plate and enjoyed every last bite. For our entrees we ordered a plate of Kung Pao chicken and a plate of Orange Chicken. We had mentioned we were going to share, and Shannon offered to split the portions up for us. She came out with four plates which we were taken back a bit because the portions were huge. It was very nice of her and the kitchen staff to split the plates and they gave us a large helping of rice on each plate. The food was seasoned well and was very filing. I had leftovers for two days, and it still tasted amazing.  There are so many different cuisine styles to choose from. Next time we will be trying a drink from their large and beautiful bar."}
{"text":"I had a really terrible experience at this restaurant on my very first visit. It was Saturday Night and strangely they weren't as busy as i thought they might be. Just to list off the issues, the waitress was much more interested in talking with her coworkers at the bar than serving us. The food took an insanely long time, especially considering the fact they did not have a full house. Two out of four of our orders came incorrect even though the changes were simple, and there seemed to be little to no remorse or regret about this. The only reason they are not getting one star is because the food was okay AFTER being remade but there was still barely any mushrooms which is what took them over an hour to get onto my sandwich. But don't waste your time, there are too many good restaurants in that whole mall area to risk a bad experience here. I recommend Gordon Biersch. The rest of the review is lengthy so this first bit is the gist. The pictures I'm posting are a more detailed account of the terrible experience (yes, I'm that upset)."}
{"text":"Thirsty Lion has a great atmosphere to hang with friends, drink and have a good time. They have great happy hour deals and play great music."}
{"text":"Nothing great...food just \"ok\"....service mediocre at best.  Noisy...making casual conversation difficult.  Better places nearby in similar price range (i.e. Brio). In my view, it is not a relaxing \"go to\" place."}
{"text":"We've been fans of Tempe Lion for sometime now, and we're excited to have them near us in SanTan. Well, overall still a solid. Food was tasty beers good (flights of 6 - 4.5oz pours are very generous, selection is pretty good mix of  broad craft beers) our sever was quite good but sometimes a little hard to get (busy night, but he did a good job). The bad part? The RIDICULOUS host/ess crew...terrible and inefficient. We had to wait  45 min for a table, not so bad really on a busy night and consistent with their estimation. What really is a bother was we were one foursome among 30+ people also waiting for a table - - when there were 16 (w e counted) empty tables inside....what the???. Ok, I get that you don't want to overburden servers and kitchens,. But then hire more Effn staff! No reason to have empty tables. At the very least let people sit and drink on a Friday night. This just seems like a bad organizational plan. Still, once seated we were pretty happy with the food/drink."}
{"text":"I came here for Trivia Night (Wednesdays at 7), it was great. The questions were fun and academic mixed with pop culture. And even whiel the Trivia was going on we had great service.  The waiter was on the top of his game. The Nachos were crunchy and loaded. My Black and Blue was served once withe Guinness was settled and tasted great  All in all a great night."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Came for a lunch date over the weekend with a few friends. I wasn't really hungry since we'd just finish a movie (and a medium bag of popcorn) so I ordered from the appetizer section of the menu and got the calamari.    Now, my hubby and I have a thing where we always order calamari (if available on the menu) and if it blows us away then we know this is a place that we'd go to again.  Well, it didn't blow me away. Not one bit. The calamari was crispy but it was bland. There was nothing special about it. The sauce was even more disappointing. It tasted like mayo with some spices blended in. I know a lot of sauces are mayo based but this one tasted too much like mayo.    The service was okay. It was really busy due to the weekend crowd plus with all the soccer games going on.  Our server did the best he could do. He was friendly but nothing memorable about my experience other than my company of course.    I probably won't be coming back but it's worth a try. It is located in Tempe Marketplace so they're bound to get traffic no matter what. I'm just picky about my calamari."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Its really nice inside with clean restrooms. The staff were very friendly. The food was tasty.. but prices were high for what you get. Fish and chips platter was 15.95 and you 3 small pieces of fish, a decent amount of fries and coleslaw. Not a great deal in my opinion"}
{"text":"I have been going to the one in Tempe for years and never had a bad experience.  I got a coupon in the mail for a free appetizer so I figured I would try it . Upon arrival I waited 10 minutes before I was acknowledged. So I say myself at the bar. Not Kore then 5 people in the restaurant. The bartender completely ignored me because she was too busy talking to somebody at the end of the bar I just assumed it was her boyfriend finally after getting her attention she came over and very rudely said what can I get you I explained to her that I had a free appetizer from the coupon sent to me in the mail and I also decided to get the fish and chips with the pretzel appetizer which I do you normally do get at Tempe location I also ordered a beer which took about 15 minutes to get there when I finally received my food it they both came on at the same time I really would have liked my appetizer pretzel first however I didn't complain.  They forgot to give me tartar sauce for the fish and chips after I asked her for the north side of tartar sauce she completely ignored me also the queso dip for the pretzels seem to be heard and on top like it had been sitting around for awhile so I requested another one with a side of some sort of mustard after that she walked away seem very angry with me I decided that I was going to leave I requested the bill and to go boxes which she completely ignored I work in the food industry and I have never been known anybody to be treated this way I was so appalled. I really didn't feel like being at the restaurant anymore so I requested my bill after waiting 10 minutes for my bill to come it finally arrived with the appetizer on the bill I explained to her that only the coupon and she had taken it already I was so upset I just I wanted to get out of there so I left 30$ on the bar and left I Will never return to the thirsty lion"}
{"text":"was in town to visit family. it was awesome and the food was soo good. the next time i come a visit im definitely coming back. so keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with a friend or friends. It might be intimidating for a \"date night\". The food and service is good,  whether at the bar or if you are seated. I've tried the Shepard's Pie and the Fish and Chips, which were very good."}
{"text":"We came in here yesterday and sat at the bar. Jen was super nice! Being that it was St. Patty's day, she was mixing food coloring for green beer. My friend proclaims, \"I've never had green beer before!\" Yes she has, three years in a row, she was too drunk to remember and I didn't want to burst her bubble. Jen grabbed some dye and made her beer green. The food was tasty. We ordered the bacon ranch potato pancake things and dipped them in the beer cheese soup, it was amazing."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after looking at their menu online. The restaurant has a nice menu with a variety of choices. My boyfriend and I sat outside on the patio and I was pretty impressed with the atmosphere. I didn't really get the pub feeling... the beer was ok... and the food wasn't typical pub food aside from the fish & chips. We had the supreme nachos that night and they were delicious. The fish tacos were pretty tasty as well. The disappointing part of our experience was the service.... it was AWFUL. We had to ask for things several times and we were constantly waiting for refills. Our waiter had too many tables and was all over the place leaving little attention for us. Maybe there is better service inside? Who knows. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the high star reviews. Went here today with my gal friend for lunch with her six year old. The menu outside looked decent and there was a nice offering of apps and salads, so we thought we would give it shot. The place was virtually empty on Saturday at lunch time. This should have clued us in. The waitress was very nice and attentive enough, so no complaints there. I ordered the $9.00 pretzel with dipping sauce and a \"seasonal salad\" mind you, the main ingredient in the title being asparagus (small specialty salad) for $8.00 and my bud ordered herself the pear & prosciutto flat bread for $8.00. We got soup for the kid, 2 iced teas and I ordered a $9.75 glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. When the carafe of wine arrived and I poured it in the glass, it barely hit the middle of the glass. Lucky if it was a 5 oz pour. Chintzy. I did indeed tell the manager when he made his \"all ok\" rounds that they needed to improve their pour or lower the price. most pathtic pour I have seen in a long time & I just got back from CA. Nuff said. The food? Pretty dismal. I can eat a good pretzel 'til the cows come home. Alas, this was not a good pretzel. It tasted like a frozen Super Pretzel that had been put in the oven; dry, tasteless, cardboardish. My friend's \"flat bread\" was also dry, stale and had stingy ingredients. We could barely detect the cheese and the prosciutto tasted and looked like thinly shaved ham. The portion of toppings was almost non-existent--didn't even cover the length of the obviously store bought flat \"bread\". (I've had tastier communion wafers).  The salad came with two tips of asparagus. There was also supposed to be some candied pecans and crumbled chèvre & grapefruit with a citrus dressing. There were perhaps a few pinhead sprinkles of chèvre, lots o' lettuce and some small broken pieces of pecan at the bottom of the plate that were unfortunately burned. The taste of the burned nuts with the bitter/sour dressing that seemed to be flavored with merely oil and lemon juice did not make for a tasteful combination. The kid didn't eat the soup. Fortunately I was able to dip a few pieces of the \"homemade\" pretzel into this to assist with swallowing.  I had to eat something after getting drunk on that 5 oz's of wine, for safety's sake. I could have gotten loopy.  Unfortunately I received a text later from my friend after having parted, only to learn that she had already made multiple trips to the bathroom after her \"lunch.\"  To make matters worse, they were playing bad boy band trendy videos the whole time we were there. $53 bucks for some crappy, half considered food, an empty joint, and really bad, loud pop factory videos makes for a never again. Perhaps they have good burgers, who knows, but charging $8.95 for a dried out pretzel is pretty criminal in my book--so if those burgers or corned beef sandwiches are good, I shall never know. I won't be back; too many other choices in this big town."}
{"text":"Strawberry Rhubarb & White Chocolate Cheesecake,Sour cream, fresh whipped cream, strawberry rhubarb purée and fresh sliced strawberries in a chocolate-hazelnut crust is to to die for! Let's face it, strawberry overload & I'm not ashamed. Feeding my dessert addiction! Plus..atmosphere & service was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here on a sat evening and it was super crazy busy. We figured it would be worth it. Unfortunately it took about 45 minutes to get our order and then to top it off the order wasnt completely done(pizza cooked) now I'm giving this 4 stars cause our server Michael and the gm Shawn went above and beyond to correct the situation and you can tell they genuinely care about their business and customers. Something you don't find often in a restaurant setting. So thank you and we will def be back for the food and atmosphere and staff but maybe at a less hectic time."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and the service was pretty good. Prices are slightly high, but the quality was good. It gets super crowded so if you have a larger party I highly recommend reservations. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the noise level. The music was rather loud which caused speaking to be louder making it very difficult to have an actual conversation. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have grown to really like the restaurant and the menu - and I love that they host the Ducks every weekend during football season! Go Ducks! The people who work here are OUTSTANDING.  I think the happy hour food is yummy - especially the chicken fingers. And the drinks are priced fair enough.  My ONLY negative experience was last weekend before a movie and they were super slow and we nearly were late to the movie - completely missing out on part of our order.  It was a communication issue I am sure, but we had to chase them down to address it and that was concerning that they never checked in our table or asked us for another round of drinks.  HOWEVER - as we walked out, the manager chased us down and apologized and offered us a free appetizer when we come back. HUGE  That kind of customer service means we'll be back.  Thanks Thirsty Lion!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. We've only been in AZ a few months and have been here about 5 times and every time it's great. The manager \"in the pink shirt\" as my 7 year old calls him, is just a nice guy!! She likes sushi and only eats it with \"yum yum\" sauce. They didn't have it so he googled it, then got the chef to whip some up and she was very happy. I also had the pear martini...EXCELLENT. The staff is fantastic also. We loved the waitress Amanda too. We haven't seen her lately but she was really great and my girls always look for her! Will always go back here without hesitation!!"}
{"text":"The Seared Ahi Salad was fantastic and I did a little research and anyone on a Medifast diet can rest assured it's right around that 500 calorie mark for your Lean and Green daily meal. The service was good and we had our food in a very timely manner. As always, the place filled up quick around th 6P hour, but they have, I think an awesome wait staff. We had some questions regarding one of the dishes and its cheese content. Our server, Josh, without asking checked with the kitchen and came back to let us know that the risotta did, in fact have cheese and offered an alternative. And, I wanted to exclude the red peppers and won ton strips from my salad. Voila, my salad came without both. So, hat's off to both Josh and the kitchen for acknowledging my request. This was also the the place where my husband and I experienced Scotch Eggs for the first time. Excellent! We are \"young,\" I might add snowbirds, but plan to bring our guests to Thirsty Lion. Keep up the greatness!"}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. A nice American-style menu selection with friendly staff. Granted, weekends can be a bit of a challenge being seated promptly. But if you want good choices, then the wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of mall restaurants or bars. Though this is an improvement over Maria Maria, I'll go back if hunger or thirst kick in while shopping, but its not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"So excited the Gilbert location has opened and I want to absolutely love it! But it's been a rough start to this opening.   A lot of the food is gone, same with the drinks, and the wait was an hour and a half to find all this out. First statement from the waitress: \"our happy hour drinks are your basic bar drinks (jack and coke, etc) and there is no happy hour food. If you were expecting Tempe, I'm sorry but we're going to disappoint you.\"   I'm hoping to come back after a time and it will be better. Right now I'm going to continue drinking my Vanilla Porter and hanging out with the man and the girl."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here! The same experience that I have received at the Tempe location. The only times I've have come have been to watch Indianapolis Colts games since for this season they are the \"official\" bar for the local group.They basically have \"reserve\"d the front bar tvs + speaker sound for our games [Sunday Ticket required or not]. During NFL season they open early around 9/930AM for the early East Coast games. Friends have told me their brunch is legit!   Food here isn't terribly British but can't be beat! Love their burgers + side salads for an entree but if you're wanting snacky-sh and happen to be dining during happy hour - that WONDERFUL kale salad + the garlic edamame! Their beer list can't be beat either - every time I'm at this location or Tempe it appears the beer list has changed [not a problem]. Service is great too whether you're sitting for 3 hours watching football or catching up with friends for a meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I love this Thirsty Lion location for trivia. Some of us girls have come separately as a result of the fun time during trivia. Wednesday Team Trivia be aware that the restaurant will fill up and cause a bit of a wait if you don't arrive early enough (starts at 7ish). Whenever there is trivia, Happy Hour specials/prices are valid, and the menu is pretty legit. I really like the Salmon Cakes and Kale Salad, both well-seasoned & great portion for the price! Happy hour also equates to $4 wells, $4 house margs and some wine specials.   Service can be a little spotty/ hit n' miss. I've had it really good- attentive staff, always refilling my water glass, personable, etc. But then I've also had it poorly where it's a struggle to get water refills, order food, pay the bill.   If you're coming just for food, gotta go with the chicken nachos sans jalapeños! If my friends and I are craving some calories, we'll split an order between 2 girls as a dinner entrée- they are just so amazing! I also appreciate their extensive beer menu, it appears to change every so often with a few staples."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent, really enjoyed out time here.  Loved that it was right at SanTan.    The Maple Old Fashion was perfect, and would recommend it if you like an old fashion.  Don't let the Maple in the name turn you off.    The Scotch Eggs were also really good and not greasy like we thought they might be.   We will defiantly be back again."}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion is another very good restaurant that's so close to being five stars.  The begin with the staff at the front door are great, so nice, so helpful, just wonderful.    Make your way to your table or the bar and unfortunately you'll be greeted by an arrangement of unnecessarily uncomfortable seating.  The bar stool while soft are backless and meant for a night club.  At the table you'll get either a cheap wooded bench or a wooden chair without lumbar support.  This is not the kind of restaurant that needs to force you out quickly so I'm not sure why the seating so terrible.  The staff though, they are a different story.  Be prepared to think this is your local dive because the staff will treat you like your one of 3 people in the either establishment, they're simply just great.  The staff will really make feel like you belong here.  Food...now that's complicated.  The menu is so much more expansive than any restaurant of comparison that you'll be hard pressed to not find at least one item that tickles your fancy.  The complication come in when there seems to be at least one awkward ingredient in each dish.  If you're not pick them you'll fare well.  I myself am very picky about my bread items and for instance, the buns and bread that accompany the burgers and sandwich really fall short.  They're tasteless flavor mops, whatever flavor you find inside of they're amazing burger is sucked out by a dry bun akin to styrofoam.    The drink selection here do not disappoint, whatever kind of beer you like they'll sure have something to fit your pallet.  They also have a great assortment or wines and an expansive mixed drink menu.   The Thirsty Lion Pub does not disappoint, well at least not across the board.  They're indubitably better than most in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped in early on a Saturday morning, 11-ish, both of our younger kids in tow.  The weather was  very nice so we decided to dine on the patio.  The atmosphere on the patio was pleasant, and we had great service, even sitting outside.    Our server was friendly and very helpful.  The food came in a timely manner, and was quite tasty.  I ordered the IPA-battered fish and chips to accompany the double chocolate porter from Four Peaks brewery...neither the beer or the food were disappointing.  I often order fish and chips at similar establishments, and I have to say the plate was on the high end of the scale here, I'd definitely recommend it.  I can't speak for the nightlife here, nor the dining experience inside, though I did go in  to have a look around.  The bar and dining area seemed spacious, there are lots of long tables in addition to two-seat tables and larger booths.  It was dark, as you would expect from a traditional pub, and I imagine when the weather here in the valley is hot, this place would make a nice oasis.  Our overall experience here was great, we definitely plan to return.  I would recommend this place to others, and would suggest if you are going to bring kids, sit outside.  The price was good too.  For one of the more higher end eating/drinking establishments at Tempe Marketplace it was very reasonably priced.  Oh yes, and with 53 beers on tap...many from local brewers, I would definitely recommend this place to fellow beer enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"I came here to grab a drink and a little something to eat before watching Jupiter Ascending at the nearby Harkins.  I sat at the very crowded bar...managing to find a seat between two people and was immediately greeted by an energetic bartender (Fern?).  I asked if they had flights.  Back in San Diego, I get flights all the time but it's usually no more than 4 or 5 tasters and around $12 or so.  Here you get SIX tasters and it's $10 flat.  Nice.  They have a very good selection...better than Yardhouse IMO.  I chose five stouts and a trippel and ordered the Happy Hour Crab and Seafood Cakes.  The crab cakes were just okay...I've had better.  I think the aioli needs work but for only $5.95 it's hard to complain.  Overall I liked Thirsty Lion and would come back to try other things.  The manager and both blonde bartenders were very attentive and the vibe of the Tempe Marketplace is awesome on a cool night in February.  A must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Service was slow to start, Tv near us didn't work, Pretzels were the frozen kind you get at the grocery store. They were over salted so much you couldn't taste the cheese!   However... our meal was delicious, and service picked up a bit. This is defiantly a place I would come to more often! Love the atmosphere and the variety of food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Tables are so close together it's uncomfortable, far too many high top tables with leather-like bar stools that your legs will hate you for, food was less than mediocre but that may be because they got my order wrong. Our waitress was very nice... but honestly, they all looked alike (absolutely not joking) and we kind of sat around waiting for our check because we didn't know who to flag down. I'll never visit this location again."}
{"text":"I was happy to be able to check out the new Thirsty Lion location at Scottsdale Fashion Square, and even happier that they were willing to treat me to lunch to do so. Full disclosure here that my meal was covered by the Thirsty Lion, but I assure you that the awesomeness of a \"free lunch\" did not influence my review. I have been to their Tempe Marketplace location, but I've mostly had beer and appetizers there -- try the Traditional Scotch Eggs if you're not counting calories and want something amazing: hard-cooked eggs wrapped in sausage, lightly breaded and fried. They cut them in half and serve with a robust mustard. Yeah, it's better than bacon.  I was greeted promptly when I arrived. My server's name was Lindsey and she stopped by to introduce herself and get my drink order shortly after I was seated and had a chance to look at the menu. Since this was a workday lunch, I stuck with the iced tea, but I did check out the \"adult beverage\" menu since they tout having 25 beers on tap.  The beer list tends toward the lighter side: lots of IPAs, ciders and pale ales. If you're into that, bonus. As for the stouts, I think I saw only two. I believe they offer a 16oz or a 20 oz pour of any on-tap beers. In addition to the beer list, there are some modern takes on classic mixed drinks (Moscow Mule, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, etc.) and another list of signature cocktails that looked interesting.  Based on the \"pub\" feel of the place, you'd think it was the typical things like burgers and fries, fish and chips, and other greasy \"pub-style\" fare. Yes, that is available, but their eclectic menu also has several salads as well as fun items like spicy Mac & Cheese, Chicken Enchiladas, and even Sushi and vegetarian options. I narrowed my options down to three: Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack, NW Pub Burger or Roasted Pork Cubano Sandwich. Lindsey was helpful and told me that she hadn't yet tried the cubano, but liked the two other options. I figured a burger is a good thing to try at a pub, and it had \"maple pepper bacon\" on it: SOLD!\"  I opted for the side salad just to try something besides fries. I took the time to take some notes, check my email, and review the drink menu again. I swear it wasn't 10 minutes before my burger was sitting in front of me in all its freshly-grilled glory. I posted a picture... it's a little blurry since it smelled great and I was HUNGRY. This was no paltry fast food-style burger. I had a thick and juicy burger like the kind you'd make at home if you had the time to do it right. At first bite, I noticed the juciness and flavor of the grilled meat was complimented by a little heat from horseradish. This was supported by sweet and salty from the bacon, which had a nice crunchiness as a result of the maple -- it was a bit caramelized and cooked to perfection. The burger was served on what looked like a ciabatta roll, which was good because the burger needed something sturdy to hold it all together. The arugula was put under the beef patty so that it wilted nicely, and the white cheddar cheese was melted very nicely. The grilled sweet onion -- a monstrous slice of onion about 1/3\" thick and grilled -- was very tasty, but it slipped around a bit and required a bit of skill to keep inside the bun while eating. The one thing I didn't notice was the \"gorgonzola infused\" part of the burger. It may have been so subtle that the other flavors eclipsed it, but it might have been one of those things that as such an integral part of the experience that I would wonder what was wrong if it weren't there.   Bottom line: Messy burger, but awesome.  The side salad had a light dressing... Just enough. The greens were fresh, but nothing special.   I usually don't eat much dessert, and almost never at lunch, but Lindsey recommended their blackberry cobbler with orange shortbread crust. Wait. What? I asked if the blackberries were fresh and she thought they were. Okay, I've got to try that! The crust definitely tasted of orange, and there were large blackberries inside. If they weren't fresh, they were picked and frozen at just the right time. The filling was hot and tasted of warm spices... cardamom, maybe? The whole thing was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I posted a picture of that here as well. I made a note about the quality of the vanilla ice cream. You can tell a lot about a place from the quality of the ice cream they use in their desserts. This was high quality, dense ice cream with flecks of vanilla bean easily visible... it could be a dessert on its own.  The bar area is a lot like the Tempe location, but there is a section off to the left of the hostess station with a lot of tables, including some outdoor seating... and I am out of room to write..."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Walking in you spot a modern looking bar.  Noise filled with old time 70's Rock music blasting throughout.  TVs sprinkled throughout. Lots of Windows but dark. (Went there for lunch). We sat outside. Service was quick and pleasant. The menu offers a lot of items to choose from. So what ever your tastes are you should be satisfied. Thought about their Irish stew. Looked interesting. Ended up with their smoked chicken Waldorf salad. I was indeed pleasantly surprised.  The smoked chicken was delicious. Wow. Nicely smoked. Great taste.  Not sure why they call it Waldorf. Did not seem like a Waldorf. But it was good!  A nice visit. Glad we sat outside.  I do not think the inside would have been very pleasant. Definitely would not been able to have a conversation. So it appears the food is good. Nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about. They have a variety of drink options. Seems like a \"safe\" place to go and have nothing really to complain about."}
{"text":"Just spent over 15 minutes at a table waiting.  No waitress or waiter.  However, I was able to see up to 4 waitresses and a manager a table over eayupting and chatting while me and my friends waited.  AS We left we told the hostess why we were leaving in front of the manager and he said absolutely nothing.  Food....don't know s......drinks, don't know.......never got either.   Service..........AWFUL!!!!!!!  I will spread the word for you manager since you cannot talk!!!!!"}
{"text":"A large selection of beer, friendly staff, great service, decent food. Really enjoyed our first visit, plan to return."}
{"text":"Everything that we had from the Happy Hour menu was fantastic, and our waiter Steve was great! We were there for the late night Happy \"Hour\" (which is from 9:30 pm until closing) on Saturday night. Sports and music videos played on the TVs around the bar, while a crowd of about 20 people sang along with \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (Journey) and a couple of other awesome songs. These are the apps and entrées that I recommend. From the \"Happy Hour\" menu: Creamy Queso Dip (looks tiny, but feeds about 3 as an app) -medium spicy mix of cheeses and bits of meat with a small dollop of spicy meat & salsa in the center. $4.95  Grilled Burger Sliders (which should be called cheeseburgers) 2 to a plate, excellent, filling, with lettuce, tomato, pickles and a special sauce made of ketchup, mayo and a hint of horseradish. $6.95  Spicy Fried Chicken Sliders (not too spicy) 2 to a plate, with chipotle slaw, marinated in jalapeño & buttermilk (which you can tell, not because it's spicy, but because the chicken is juicy and tender), the breading is a thin, mildly spicy crispy perfect breading. $6.95  From the \"Late Night\" menu: BBQ White Cheddar Burger, with Garlic Aioli (which was fantastic) with perfectly fried onion shoestrings.  $13.95  Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack (huge) white corn tortillas filled with smoked shredded chicken mixed with creamy garlic aioli, cheeses...(it's filling and creamy). The plate comes with small sides of black beans and salsa. There's a fried jalapeño on the plate, as well, but none of tried it, haha. $16.95  Baja Fish Tacos - 3 soft white corn tortillas with sautéed cod or shrimp, cilantro lime slaw, pico, and Cotija cheese, with limes on top, and a side of Santa Fe bacon black beans (with a fried jalapeño) $15.95  If you don't read my reviews on Dining Grades, I'll just leave a quick note here that the restroom trashcans were overflowing. But, it was a Saturday night, and it would definitely not keep me from going again.  Great food, Nice restaurant, Fun Happy Hour(s)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid three stars. Went in the other day for dinner and tried the calamari, and a pepper bacon cheese burger with fries. The burger was really good, the fries were kind of meh and the calamari was ok. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and was fast on clearing everything away when we were done. Atmosphere was pretty much a nicer sports bar if that's what you're into."}
{"text":"The food here lacks consistency. The only item I have had that was well made and is actually good is the burger. The rest of their items are very basic with not much flavor, it's your typical bar food. The service is very slow, almost if they are always understaffed. I have never had fast or great service. I have been here a handful of times. Not the best option in the mall."}
{"text":"When J-WoW told me about Thirsty Lion's amazingly generous offer to Yelp Elites, I was stunned.  All I had to do was send an email stating the day/time my party wanted to show, along with the Elites in my party, and they would provide us with a comped meal, including apps and desserts!  Parking wasn't too bad, in their ample lot, and was only a short walk to the front door.  Once inside, Tom D greeted us with a smile and a hearty handshake.  The interior was spacious, so I took a stroll to survey the estate.  This location includes a delightful patio area.  We were led to a reserved high-top table in the bar area.  Yes, they were expecting us.  It was about this time that our 4th, Kazi, arrived.  We hugged, we laughed, we looked at the menu.  Since the apps were on the house, I had to go with the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna, since J decided on the Bacon Wrapped Dates.  My Ahi couldn't have been more perfect.  It was as good as I've ever had anywhere else.  And I shared my wares with the whole table.  For my entree, I had to try the Grilled Atlantic Salmon.  Once again, the fish was perfectly prepared.  At $21, it may be a tad expensive, and generous, for a lunch, unless you're sporting quite the noontime appetite, as it came with a mound of white cheddar mash and al dente green beans.  My friends and I were treated exceptionally well by the staff here.  It's quite a ways away from my home and office, but I would absolutely return if in the area.  Thank you Thirsty Lion management and staff"}
{"text":"The Scottish eggs were amazing, so were the fish and chips.  The bartender we had was spot on and hilarious.  I would give her a shout out if I could remember how to spell her name without butchering it (Red Head behind the bar Monday afternoon, thank you!).  Excited for the new one to be built in Scottsdale.  Will definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"The Gastropub Burger was so amazing, the staff is attentive and I enjoyed the drinks. I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite regular spot.  Everything has been good.  Filet, Chicken, Burgers - all great.  Fish - decent.  I've sat all over in here and my favorite spot is on the left side of the bar (if your standing at the entrance) at the high tables.  You get the music videos in the center and the sports on both sides of it (yeah I've watched several NFL games with company here).  Service is excellent.  I recommend the Thirsty Lion.  Oh, p.s. I'd pass on the grilled artichoke otherwise all else has been thumbs up."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing food, this place is mainly a bar but has a nice menu,  unfortunately my experience was not great. Hummus appetizer portion was like they had just run out, literally maybe one tablespoon of hummus accompanied by a large assortment of bread and veggies. Spinach artichoke dip was cold and would have been a decent size had the ingredients been nuked a little and stirred up. Again a ton of bread. Good thing cuz the ribeye steak was extremely fatty and the mashed potatoes inedible, obviously instant. And the steak salad had good flavor but literally 4 little slices of cold steak. Yuck! Sad because we had hopes for a decent meal...it cost enough it should have been better!"}
{"text":"I am in love with everything about this place! the food, drinks ambience and especially their homemade Ranch dressing is unlike anything else! I usually always start with their house salad because they have Real GREEN romaine lettuce with veggies, not the iceberg crap i'm used to getting. I am super picky about my margaritas and this might be my favorite Margarita i've ever had! LOVE this place so much i had to finally write a review!"}
{"text":"The Mussels and Prawns were well-made, however the service as well as the drinks were less than satisfactory. Robert was inattentive and seemed aloof the entire meal. Came for lunch on a slow-looking Tuesday afternoon in off-hours. The least he could've done was stopped by the table more than once to check in. My beer was extremely vinegary and Robert didn't bother stopping by to check on how the drinks came out. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My bestie and I were at TMP for a movie and decided to try it out. Not really a pub feel, more of a high end sports bar. The place is very large, with TV's everywhere and roomy inside with a nice wrap around patio. We got there at HH, great prices on the apps and drinks. The service we had was attentive and nice. Would definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly an awesome place within Tempe Marketplace! The Blood Orange Margarita is amazing!  We had the fish & chips and the filet and both were outstanding. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a To Go order of a steak salad for my wife who is not feeling well.  She usually really likes their salads.  Unfortunately what should be a simple order turned out to be a couple of small chunks of meat and a sad bunch of lettuce.  We used to like going to this place but apparently we won't be going forward and definitely won't be ordering take out from there."}
{"text":"As someone who works in the service industry, I was pretty disappointed and almost disgusted during my visit yesterday. One of the biggest rules of thumb is cleanliness, and part of this means restraining your hair when you're serving, bartending or running food. Not only that if you're going to touch/play with your hair, be sure you wash your hands afterward instead of picking up my food and bringing it over. This place is far more focused on it's aesthetic than it's quality of service."}
{"text":"Work brought me here for lunch with coworkers.  I only got a side salad because I wasn't all that hungry.  The salad was good and sized appropriately.  All the burgers, sandwiches, and soups looked really good and made me wish I had a bigger appetite.  I was also curious to try the Asian foods they offered.  Service was fast and good and the atmosphere makes a really good place to watch sports.  I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Excellent spot especially is you are a sports fan. The place is spacious and super clean. Watched most world cup games there. The General Manager is absolutely professional and friendly. He interacts with everyone and is always available for any questions. The staff are also super knowledgeable and spot on when taking your orders. All smiles and fast, efficient service! Definitely going back there and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and the atmosphere was great! The playoffs were on and there was just a really fun vibe. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was sooo delicious! Definitely a new favorite! We also split the NW Pub burger which was yummy too! Didn't love the fries though. Service was great and overall we had a great time! We will come back soon!"}
{"text":"if you have someone in a wheel chair forget about it. They  said 20 minutes, after 30 I had to ask because tons of people were being seated. They kept saying oh I did not know you needed a low table. We did not, but 15 minutes later I told them hey they said 20 minutes and saw the wheel chair, but since your not handicap friendly we can leave. The manager got involved and said they would fix it. Food has always been good."}
{"text":"Visiting from California! Great experience sat at the bar, very friendly staff and excellent food. Had wine and the Brussel sprout appetizer. Yum! Connor at the bar was great!"}
{"text":"The only reason this hip and trendy watering hole (which has all the charm of an airport bar) is getting two stars, instead of just one, is because the \"fish part\" of their fish and chips is so good. Our party of six stopped in for dinner last Sunday night: my 21-year-old daughter and her boyfriend (both ASU students), his parents, who had flown in from California for the ASU and Cardinal's games, and my husband and me. None of us had been here before, but my older daughter said she'd heard good things about it and we were looking for something near the airport. The guys also wanted a pub where they could watch sports on TV. The place was about half-full when we arrived, so I have no idea why we ended  up with a table almost at the back of the room, next to the servers' station and where my husband and our guests could see a TV only by looking over their shoulders.Talk about a pain in the neck! So ridiculous. Anyway, we ordered the artichoke spinach dip appetizer, which was average. Daughter ordered the Baja fish tacos and thought they were good. Her boyfriend had the orange chicken and said it was bad. His father had the beer cheese soup and thought it was great; his mother tried the quinoa something-or-other and said it was terrible; she hardly touched it. My husband had the bacon burger; I have to say it looked amazing and he thought it was great. I had the fish and chips and while the Napa slaw was tasteless and little more than chopped cabbage that had been dragged through a little mayo, and the chips were average, the battered fish pieces (3) were fried to crisp perfection. Really...the best battered fish I've ever had. So the food was hit or miss. My real problem was with the service...of which there was little to none. Our zombie-like server - on the rare occasions when we came into contact with her - wasn't exactly hostile, but her absolute disinterest, combined with her long absences from our table, really ruined the experience for us. Never once did she smile or engage us in any way, other than to take our order. No wasting time with pleasantries here, folks...just order, eat, and get the $&%& out. That's what it felt like. Except it took FOREVER for our food to arrive. And when one of our guests ordered a glass of wine, we literally waited at least 20 minutes for it...and got it only after we were finally able to flag down our server to inquire about it. When we asked what had happened to the wine, she said, \"Oh, the bartender's pouring that right now for you.\" Really? The place is half empty and it's a glass of *%&@ wine. It's been 20 minutes or more. Clearly, she'd simply forgotten about our order. Not ONCE during our drinks/appetizer or during dinner did our server (or anyone else, like a manager) ever stop by to inquire about our dining experience or to ask if we needed anything. No one ever asked if we needed something more to drink. No one EVER refilled any of our glasses. During the lost wine episode, we attempted to flag down a couple of other servers - for God's sake, ANYONE - who could help us since we hadn't seen our own server in forever, but no one even looked our way. Remember Tom Hanks in \"Cast Away\" when he finds himself all alone and marooned on that island and then he sees that ship's light way off on the horizon and he's desperately trying to get someone's attention? That's what this felt like. Horrible service!! H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E! Since our experience, I've read a few reviews and now understand that poor service appears to be a frequent complaint here. I wish I'd known that before. We ended with a dinner tab of around $165 for mostly average food, a couple of cokes, and some wine; usually I tip 20% or more, but felt that the 10% tip I left here was overly generous. I left feeling embarrassed that we'd taken our guests to this place for dinner before they left town. There are too many other decent places to eat; we'll never darken this door again."}
{"text":"This place turned out to be a lovely surprise. After 10pm i believe it turns a 21 and over only restaurant which is kind of nice. We stopped in during a weekday and there was good music and the lights were dimmed and people were just hanging out eating and drinking and having a good time. The menu is different during the later hours but still a lot of very good choices. They have a white cheddar burger and it was probably one of the best I have ever had. It was just delicious ( I had one again a few days later..shhhhhh, our secret) and also tried their chipotle mac and cheese and it was fattening and yummy as could be. they have a pretty decent beer selection although not as crafty as some other places like Hungry Monk or Topps but still a good craft selection. Its huge inside and outside and more than enough room and space to get a good table or seat at the bar. Highly suggest checking it out, very good addition to Tempe.  side note: they let me add a fried egg to my burger- which immediately chalked up their awesomeness- yes awesomeness."}
{"text":"This was our first time, and our last time at Thirsty Lion. Without going into the entire experience....the service was VERY slow, our drink order was a mess and the menu is overpriced for the quality. $70 later, feeling dissatisfied and totally disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at Thirsty Lion. When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be about a 25 minute wait (for 2). It was more like 35-40 when our table was finally ready, but whatever. Next time I'll make a reservation.  The food I ordered was awesome! Chicken Penne Gorgonzola (or something like that). The sauce was flavorful and had a kick thanks to the red pepper flakes, plus some spinach and halved cherry tomatoes. Best part, they didn't skimp on the cheese! :D I wasn't crazy about how the chicken was cut into thick chunks (on the bias would be more appetizing for such a beautiful dish), but that's just me being picky I suppose.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out the new Scottsdale Thirsty Lion! I have only been to the Tempe location once before and I heard the Scottsdale Fashion Square location had just opened up. Our server Gary was super friendly, outgoing and able to answer questions about the menu. We ordered draft beers and my lunch date was happy they had Sculpin IPA available and I went for a tasty Crispin Apple Cider per my usual sweet tooth.  The menu - We loved the bacon wrapped prawns!! They tasted like they were grilled to perfection and who doesn't love bacon wrapped anything?! A must try! The salad under the prawns was even quite tasty and I commented on how I never usually eat the little appetizer salads. This was like a cole slaw that tasted nothing like typical cole slaw.  Next I ordered the Salmon Risotto and it was so creamy! Good stuff! I also tried a few fresh cut fries and believe me they are worth cheating on your diet for the afternoon! Thank you for a great experience!  We sat in the bar area at a table with comfy stools as we chatted and watched sports highlights and music videos on huge flat screen TVs. There is a second bar area which is located in the restaurant. It looks like it could probably service a decent amount of thirsty lions! Can't wait to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Food here is to die for. I crave the deep fried green beans like no other, my favorite appetizer EVER! Music played here is an awesome variety and makes for a chic, modern environment. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is they let people with strollers sit at the bar and it makes the place extra crowded (more than it already is.)"}
{"text":"This place could be so much better if they would improve the drink menu.  The food is pub food which isn't great but isn't bad."}
{"text":"Monday night at 8pm...you would think that they would be on top of all 20 customers that were in there...but no, waitress is non existant...ordered bottle of wine and waited 20 min for it..I could have walked to total wine and back in less time....now for the food problems, ordered the sirloin steak...it was so tough and chewy I couldn't chew it...called the waitress and told her, response...\"what do u want me to do about it??\" I couldn't believe the lack of any training or customer service skills....having been a chef for Marriott for 10+ years..I know a good steak from a bad one....they made me another one...another 20 - 30 min...same result, in edible..sent that one back....finally after over an hour of this BS, manager finally comes over (which is about an hour too late) he offers to make me another one...I tell him that I don't have 3 hours to eat dinner and I ask for the check...he doesn't do ANYTHING to make it right or try and retain me as a customer....this place is a joke, no training, poor service, sub par, expensive food, and I don't even know why they have a manager as he was never in sight....this place better get their shit together or they will bite the dust."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The staff was friendly enough. My one star is really not their fault. It was the food. After all, that is really what this place is for. We had Calamari. Please don't have things on your menu you can't cook well. If you want to chew on rubber bands then order their Calamari. Salmon Cakes, I had to spit it out. Flat bread pizza, Can I have some pizza with that salt please. And I would advise you call in your order the day before, and maybe they'll get it to your table before you have to leave.  So many places to eat. Go there."}
{"text":"I was invited to the soft opening at TL and the food was very good. They mixed up my entree and the service was spotty but it was a training night and it was free so I was satisfied.  I went again this week and the food again was tasty and fresh but the service was missing. My entree was warm but not hot because of the service. We had to call someone to pick up our check and our entree order wasent taken until well after our app was finished. It added 20-30 min to our night.  The service needs to step up because I like the Thirsty Lion and want it to succeed. Great atmosphere btw."}
{"text":"Slooooow service.  Really slow. Lots of staff so unsure what there problem is.   Fantastic bbq prawns.   I'd order those again but not stay for drinks. Other food looked super also."}
{"text":"Didn't start off well. Looked over menu for about 15 min and no waiter or waitress came to get our drink order. I asked a passing waiter if he was ours and his response was he'd look into it. He passed our table several times more and finally I asked him what was up and his response was I'm looking into it. Finally my husband went to the hostess table to ask about a server. The manager Sean came over and apologized profusely. We ordered and loved our fish and chips. Thank you to their manager Sean for stepping up. We will be back. Great diverse menu for a pub!"}
{"text":"Just was there on 3/18 during happy hour, but did not get the discount after asking waiter. Food was over priced for a small portion. Better place to hangout and have a beer then to eat."}
{"text":"After putting our name in for a patio table, we were given a 20-30 minute wait time. After waiting 45 minutes the host told us she did not know when she would be able to seat us, and asked if we wanted to just keep waiting. Of course we said no thank you and left pretty disappointed. Didn't need to waste an hour of our time with an empty promise, but can we really blame them? They are just young faces hired to look good as you walk in. At least, that's the way it felt."}
{"text":"HUGE fan of this place!! I really like their newer location at Scottsdale Fashion Square because it's right by their new Camelview Theaters which make a great dinner & movie date option. Thirsty Lion is also the right place to catch some sports as they have nice flatscreen's throughout the restaurant.   My boyfriend and I started off with the Ultimate Chicken Nachos and ultimate is the best descriptor. Somehow they've made the chicken to taste almost chorizo-like and full of flavor. The chipotle aioli makes the dish for me, as it's drizzled all over the final creation and makes every bit extra awesome. Honestly we probably could have ended our dinner just after splitting that because it was plenty of food but alas, we each ordered an entree.  Well I guess mine was technically not an entree because it came from the appetizer menu but nonetheless I ate it like an entree; I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders. They are super yummy if you're a pulled pork fan like myself. Three of them come on a plate and topped with Napa slaw (aka coleslaw) and garlic aioli. If I didn't eat a huge plate of nachos just before, I would have ordered a side of fries to go with them. Zach ordered the Roasted Pork Cubano which is marked on their menu as a Thirsty Lion Signature Item. I got to try a bite and it was really delicious and packed with flavor. Hand cut fries come as a side with the sandwich and those a great too.   Lastly, if you go to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location, make sure to ask for Patrick as your server. He's attentive, gives good food ordering advice (like to order the Ultimate Nachos), and is a super sweet guy. The rest of the staff is friendly too, you really can't go wrong. They have awesome happy hours deals too!"}
{"text":"This is a great drinks and dining experience.  The service staff is outstanding and the food is delicious.  Food is served quickly and hot.  The portions are very fair for the price and the restaurant and bar environment is very comfortable.    A wonderful restaurant to visit before or after a movie at the Harkins Theater.  The Thirsty Lion is the best restaurant in Scottsdale Fashion Mall and their Pub Burger is one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Everyone was super friendly and the atmosphere was great. The food was delish ! Had the fish tacos and California roll both very  good! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We like the Thirsty Lion at Tempe Marketplace a lot more. For some reason we always have bad luck at the Santan location.   The service is not very good at all. On several occasions, not just once, we have ordered drinks and reminded the servers constantly about it and we will finish our entire meal and still do not have our drinks yet?! Then the servers seem offended when we say forget the drinks.   We also have had a few servers who are extremely awkward and rude. We had a server who would cuss every time she came to check up on us and we have also had a server who was talking poorly to us about other customers. We aren't offended easily, but it is the lack of professionalism that bothers us.   The food can be a little pricey, we still enjoy it, but really find ourselves avoiding it solely because of service. The rating isn't about the food, it's 100% about the service."}
{"text":"To start our visit, every employee at the host stand had their backs to the door as we walked in - they turned around, saw us waiting for service, and turned back around and ignored us. Our server only asked one of us what we would like to drink before walking away, and gave attitude when the rest of my party put in what they ACTUALLY wanted to drink. It took over ten minutes to get a cider and cocktail; we could see that the entire time, all three bartenders were not busy - they just weren't making our drinks for whatever reason. Our food came out before the drinks. I ordered a burger medium well, and what was on my plate was medium rare, MAYBE medium. My friend's burger came with avocado when she asked for it to be kept off. After our food arrived, we saw our server once, and had to struggle to flag down another employee to get our checks and a box.   Terrible service. Rude employees. This experience makes me never want to dine here again."}
{"text":"I tried Roasted cubano sandwich and it was delicious. Also,tried one of their pizzas and I just couldn't stop eating! Customer service was amazing too, very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I suppose, depending on the time, you can find a good reason to come here. K and I were looking for something to do while C was at rehearsal for Fiddler on The Roof. We thought we would give this place a try. OMG, what a hassle parking is. It felt like it was the holiday season with so many cars pulling into the center. I can't even imagine what this place will be like come December.  We found a spot to park. There were a ton of people standing outside. It didn't look promising but the hostess told us there was immediate seating on the patio. Of course there is, it's 112' outside. But interestingly enough, the patio was almost full. We took her up on her offer and got seated on the patio.  K and I ordered a couple of beer flights ($10). This is an awesome deal and one I might actually fight the parking madness to partake in again. Six 4.5 oz samples for 10 bucks. There were some issues when the flights arrived but they got ironed out and in the end it was an awesome deal and the samples were frosty cold.   In addition to the beer K and I also ordered some happy hour food. We chose the sliders ($4.95) which were actually a couple of pretty tasty sliders. I would recommend these. Simple pork sliders with a decent slaw and garlic aioli. Not too dry and a good value. We also got the Artichoke Spinach Dip ($5.95). Hot, bubbly cheesy goodness mixed with chopped artichokes, jalapeños, and roasted garlic. They serve this with tortilla chips but not enough of them as you will run out for sure.  Our server was a bit ditsy which was reflected in the mistakes that were made. Probably why this place rates a 3 Star and with the experience K and I shared, a 3 Star is fair.  Crazy Parking. 7 Day a Week Happy Hour. Good Food. Good Drinks. Lacking in Service. Fair Pricing for Happy Hour. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new addition to the San Tan Village area.  We have been there multiple times and have enjoyed it.  We generally sit at the bar and order our meals along with beverages.  We can definitely recommend the salads, especially the seared ahi.  The service is excellent and one of the managers (Howard) is always on the prowl making sure that you are enjoying yourself.  (He's really nice.)  Expect  long wait if you go at prime times.  Its that way because it is good!  It will become one of our go-to places"}
{"text":"Not a bad hot spot for happy hour. We came here to watch some basketball and get some bites. The food is okay .. A little better than regular bar food. The service sometimes lacks too."}
{"text":"Really a great spot for a quick bite to eat- they have great food and the atmosphere is very lively especially during football season. The artichoke hearts are by far my favorite here! Me and my husband will be back"}
{"text":"This place has outstandingly slow and crappie service. We waited 45 minutes for 2 sandwiches and when they arrived thet were kinda of semi-warm . I ordered iced tea and everytime I had to wait a long time for a refill and the tea was really warm. As the last spit in the bucket, the waitress shorted me by 94 cents since my bill was $32.06 and the waitress only returned $67 from my benjamin, prompting me to leave 0 extra tip for stealing my change! What a freaking zoo"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always had excellent service. The food is what you'd expect from a gastropub, and neither my guests or I have ever had any complaints about the food. I especially love the artichoke starter.   Bar menu is satisfying with a good mix of local and other beers. The cocktail selection is adequate and made with quality.   Indoors is quite loud (the music is way too loud) so I always opt to sit outside.   I love this place for a chill meet up with friends; then you can walk it all off around San Tan Village mall."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Pretty impressive. We first walked in, but it did not feel too welcoming. We wai we about twenty minutes and finally got sat. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered a flight of six beers which was really cool. However, during ordering, they seemed to be out of every beer, which was disappointing. We ordered the calamari for appetizers, and for someone who doesn't like seafood, it was good! We both ordered salads and they were tasty. We will be back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Well... It was alright. The service wasn't exactly the best but the waitress was nice. The bar had a nice set up though and I didn't realize how big the place was! I have the Southwest chicken salad! Yum :)"}
{"text":"checked out this place tonight with my wonderful friend~ the Cesar salad was good, but the better one was definitely the scotch egg~ caught my love~ amber beer was good~ and the environment was cool~ nice for talks~"}
{"text":"We recently held our 20 year high school reunion here and it was perfect! The food was good and the service was spectacular! The event coordinator, Deanna and the manager, Sean were so accommodating and made sure that the event was a success! Everyone had a great time and I would highly recommend this venue for group events."}
{"text":"Just visiting area and was exhausted from heat and came across this pub. Didn't eat but had a nice cold local draft ipa Called Four Peaks and it and the service were great.  Place was clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time here and 1st time with kids. The food, service and manager are awesome!  Had meatball and pork sliders-VERY good.  Great beer!  Kids had sliders and Mac n Cheese and loved it. Son has peanut allergy and the manager came out to discuss menu items=amazing. Fantastic patio dining and overall experience both with and without kiddos. Our new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and beer selection. Service is hit or miss, so I wouldn't suggest going in if you are in a rush! Menu is great, I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like. The Veggie Panini, Caprese Chicken Sandwich or any of the flatbreads are my favorite. I always get a side of ranch if I get fries, the peppercorn ranch is awesome! Lots of TVs for game viewing, and a really nice patio space. One of the better restaurants in Tempe Marketplace, worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Let me just say, I've been here a few times and had a good experience but tonight topped the cake!! We came in for some birthday drinks for me (happy birthday me), and my husband was hungry but I am a pescitarian, and in only eating fish for meat, he ordered us some fish tacos. Well they made chicken tacos and gave them to us. Right before taking a bite, the manager rushed over and stopped us and clarified the mistake, thank goodness!!! He was so very genuine and apologetic and corrected the mistake. The cooks came over and apologized too and were so caring about it! They saved me from ruining a ten year chicken-free run, and on my birthday! The right food was excellent! The drinks were perfect! The staff was so friendly and helpful! Our bartender was awesome! She was singing 80's songs with us and was just having a good time too. Just an overall excellent night. Thank you thirsty lion!!!"}
{"text":"This place is huge!  We just stopped in for beverages.  Next time I want to try the food.  They have a lot of TVs, and good service. Good crowd and employees. Everything in the building looks pretty new (a few years old maybe)."}
{"text":"So I was meeting some friends here last night for drinks for a friend's birthday. We were supposed to meet at 9:30 but it was around 10:30 when we actually got to the bar. We walked in and had our IDs checked and then stood around awkwardly...I'm not sure why this happened, but after a few minutes we were asked if we needed a table. Yup...that's why we're here. So we were seated near the bar. The place is large and the decor is fine, but the music they were playing was mainly from the 90's and made the place seem less 'hip' I guess, not that I know much about being hip. We waited for about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. The waiter finally came by and took our drink order. I got the agave basil margarita ($8.50) which was soooo good! I was very happy with the drink. The Birthday Girl got a blueberry bliss... which wasn't what she was expecting. I tried it and thought it was good, but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink. The others got beers.   So the real problem, for me at least, was my second drink. I got a tropical margarita ($7.00). It was one of the worst drinks I have ever had and was a challenge to drink. It was SO acidic and just nasty, I swear the two drinks could not have come from the same place...but they did. That's a huge red flag for me.  Side note: Why do restaurants think it's cool to not price their signature drinks....why should I have to ask how much it costs? I find this completely ridiculous and annoying. The drinks didn't end up being very expensive here, but I feel like I should have that information available to me on the menu just like any other item.... *ok steps off soapbox*  As far as food goes, one of my friends got a side of fries that were pretty good and came with bbq sauce, but other than that we did not eat. I have heard good things about their food from other people.   After we were done with our second round of drinks (and the fries) we decided to move on to another bar.....but we couldn't because we had no check! Our waiter, who had been almost harassing us towards the beginning of our night, had completely disappeared. He finally came by like 10-15 minutes later and reeked of cigarettes....there is no way he only smoked one because I could almost taste it...pretty gross for a waiter. Anyway, our checks were brought fairly quickly after that and we were finally able to leave.    Conclusion: Be very careful what you order....it is a total mixed bag."}
{"text":"We came here for reverse happy hour a few days ago. I've only been to the Tempe one and really wanted to try their happy hour menu. I just noticed that they opened a Scottsdale location so we wanted to try this location.   It was hard for me to try the items I wanted because I couldn't eat meat this past Friday that we went and they don't have a lot of non meat items on their happy hour menu. I ended up getting their calamari and their hand cut pub fries. Both were really good. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheddar potato cakes and he loved it!  I also got their house margarita which is not too shabby.   The only thing that did it for me was the service wasn't great. The waitress didn't write down our order so she couldn't remember it and ended up coming back and asking all of us what we ordered again. To top it off, my sister's drink was wrong. She ordered a vodka lemonade & she brought a vodka and pineapple. Their burger was also incorrect. They wanted it medium, and it came out well done. Note to staff, write down the orders so you get it correct for your customers. The food wasn't terrible, we all actually enjoyed it, however service needs a little work."}
{"text":"I was in AZ for work and finished the day around 10pm.  Luckily I found this this spot was open late, and we were able to order dinner.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and given the option to sit indoors or outdoors. We opted for outdoors, as they had a large patio with nice fire pits.   I decided to go with the soup and sandwich combo. I went with a recommendation that the waitress made of their famous cheese and beer soup, and the mediterranean chicken sandwich. The soup was absolutely awesome. I have never had anything quite like it. (Thats saying a lot because i love soup) It had a great flavor but neither the beer or cheese was dominate or overpowering. I would go back solely for the soup haha. The sandwich was good as well, but nothing over the top.  My friend went with the caesar salad and sliders. The salad was basic, no frills with ceased, and she said the sliders were very good.  Overall we both liked this spot. Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and bonus points for being open late."}
{"text":"We decided to try somewhere new-ish for a late night snack and this location just opened up -perfect! We have been to the Tempe location before and were impressed with the late night food menu and and normal happy hour specials but that location was a tad far from home so when this location opened we were excited. I'm not sure if the specials are location specific or my bad memory but it seemed like the Tempe location has more food specials? & and a veggie sandwich on the late night menu? Anywho they had a few things we could nibble on -no worries. I got the spinach and artichoke dip and my beau got the chicken fingers. Mine was enough for 2-3 people and tasted industry standard -good but not wow and his food was pretty pitiful looking. A few stringy-dinky thin slices of chicken- not worth the price. I felt bad for him since I suggested we come here but maybe it was an off night?  On the plus side- the service was excellent -our waiter was very enthusiastic and friendly.   The prices for HH/late night are reasonable but will prolly not be back for normal food hours. -doesn't seems worth it -too pricey.  I love their patio - way better than yard house/kona/ztejas patio by far.  We'll prolly find ourselves back sometime but it's not going to be our go to place for HH & Reverse HH."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and friendly staff but the food kinda sucks. Have been there 3 times in the past month hoping it was a one off, but all 3 meals were seriously lacking. We will only come for drinks now:/"}
{"text":"Been in a couple of times and when it's not one thing it's another. First time I came in with my family for a family members birthday dinner, we requested a patio table and were quoted a 40 min wait by the host although there was A LOT of open tables outside. Their reason was the kitchen was understaffed? How can you have an understaffed kitchen on a weekend night when is it classified a higher end restaurant... not very professional.. Also can't remember our servers name but she smelled like cigarettes. Second time we came in it took the server like 10 min for her to greet us. A manager stopped by our table to apologize, of course what else can they do... although she wasn't very nice. Went in a third time to celebrate my birthday thought that maybe third times the charm but i was WRONG, the host up from were all chit chatting with their backs turned to the door with their phones out, I stood there until one finally realized we were standing there and apologized .... of course. TERRIBLE experience so not returning to this location again. Better service at Tempe and Scottsdale!!!!  As far as the food, I asked for my steak to be well done and it was so pink it disgusted me... appetizers took forever and came out at the same time. Some of our salads were dry and lettuce was gross and brown. I don't remember my servers names but she was a dark headed short girl maybe early 20s. Made me think she's forgot to ring in our food and everything came out at once..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a drink and am in love! Their Elderflower Mojito was perfect. The atmosphere was laid back and they play music videos in the bar which is super fun. Can't wait to come back again for food, the menu looked great."}
{"text":"Delicious, need I say more! Service was excellent and we arrived at peak dinner time. Every employee was courteous and seemed to love their job. Would definitely return when in AZ for Spring Training next year."}
{"text":"Ugh. Crappy service, poorly prepared food. Ordered a cheeseburger. Instead received BBQ white cheddar burger, which was hideously oversauced with both BBQ and some sort of aioli. On top of that wet mess was a massive pile of onion strings. When the waiter finally circled back by to see how we were doing, I gestured to the pile of strings I'd shoveled off onto my plate and said \"I'd hoped to avoid that\", to which he replied that he'd submitted the order with \"no onions\" instructions, blaming the kitchen for the mistake. Huh? I didn't ask for \"no onions\", I just ordered something that didn't come with the strings. So he was lying. No offer to make it right. Receipt confirmed he'd just ordered the wrong burger, with no mention of no onions.  The burger patty was good, but lost in a sea of sauce. The bun was a soggy mess as a result. Big check for a crappy experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went with my family at 3 in afternoon when the place was empty. We sat down for 10 minutes, had are orders ready and never had a waitress come to our table. There was 3 in front just chatting with each other, we just walked out. Awful service"}
{"text":"Ate here one night and everything we had was phenomenal. From the sushi appetizer to my salad and his burger. The menu is a little pricey to me, but for a once in awhile treat its not bad. My brother-in-law had a pasta dish that was out of sight! So I truly believe you can't go wrong with what you order on this menu. There are some items I really want to try when I go back. The atmosphere is casual upscale and its a little dark inside but they also have outdoor seating if that bothers you. When we went it was raining and I liked being inside haha I thought it was a nice environment. Our server was friendly and when asked told us her recommendations, but also clarified that she is vegetarian so she couldn't comment on the meat with some dishes. She did eat fish though and said their sushi was her favorite and very popular. It was a good choice! She always kept our drinks filled as well. Thanks! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place for dinner or just to have a drink great beers always on tap. Sometimes can be very busy but worth the wait. Great date night place to walk around before or after dinner."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great happy hour. Great variety of food on menu. Everyone can be satisfied. Bartender Bradley was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague, if your wishing to see and more importantly hear a major sporting event, they DO NOT want your business, they want to keep their sterile atmosphere intact, they want to keep the families that spend ALL THE MONEY just honkey dory.    The staff are wonderful, friendly and helpful,  the food is a resounding 5/6 out of 10. I just ask the question why do they have such large screens everywhere for, must be to watch films........I suppose."}
{"text":"I had one of thier signature NW Pub burgers...it was excellent! Cooked correctly and bursting with flavor. My friend had the Turkey Club sandwich. It was very big and I managed a bite and it was tasty as well. No complaints visiting this location. There happens to be several eateries within walking distance here so keep that in mind if your in the mood for something else...."}
{"text":"Had dinner at 6:15.  There was a very long wait but we made reservations through open table and were seated right away.  It is very crowded but not surprised since this was their second weekend open.  Server was sort of friendly but very rushed. Had a beer and it if course was good.  Appetizer was chicken nachos which was very good and nice portion size.  One mistake was appetizer plate was brought out with yellow globs of food on it... Very disgusting.   Daughter ordered fish and chips, which was very good.  I ordered stacked chicken  enchilada it was good but would have been Better if the flavor had not been identical to the nachos.  Same smoked chicken, same flavor base.  Talked with manager and he said they used the wrong chicken on the nachos.  So overall I would go back.  They have growing pains but worth the visit.    Update:  Second visit, great service.  Some Food was brought out Luke warm.  Daughters fries were cold and tough, Mac and cheese barely warm.  Pork sliders came out hot and tasted great.  Daughters pub burger was spot on.   Update: Well they went downhill bad.  Service was terrible and they were very inattentive.   I had the pub burger.  Onion was raw and the fries came out in one large clump all stuck together.  Manager was an idiot.  Kept making excuses and stumbled over his words.  Place is way too loud.  Could not hear my daughter talk.  Will not go back!  Update:  Well we went back again, hoping it would be a good visit.  Service was terrible. I ordered Tuscan pizza which came out very undercooked.  Daughter ordered California roll which came out as calamari.  Employee made excuses of being understaffed for poor service. Manager agreed pizza was not done. Took over 45 minutes to get our dinner to us which we could not eat.  Manager seemed to not care had smirk on his face and kept staring at the floor while I was trying to talk with him. We were idiots for going back."}
{"text":"Love the Happy Hour. Really good variety. I had sushi last time, the California rolls were huge and really good. The service is decent. The people I was with had beer questions that the waitress didn't know the answer to. I work at a bar and I knew how to answer those questions. The girls work attire is cute. I liked the overall feel and outside seating. Definitely craving my meal I had the other day and will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Everything about it, you can pick anything from the menu and it will be fantastic! The people are friendly and the atmosphere are superb for a sports bar. This is a must for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here.  I've had other friends rave about this place so we decided to try it.  First of all this is one of the rare places that serves my favorite Boddington's Pub Ale on tap.   My friend had the Gastropub Burger which was cooked perfectly and looked delicious.  I had the fish and chips which was lightly fried and tasted very fresh.  Each of our orders came with fries which were a 10: they seemed to be double fried and were crunchy and delicious.    The service was attentive but not obtrusive.  All in all it was a perfect meal at a great place.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"My friend I stopped in for drinks, appetizers and conversation after shopping. It was great! We had a nice big booth and they didn't mind that we just wanted to sit for a couple of hours to catch up. It wasn't very busy yet and we appreciated the great service the entire time without any passive aggressive hints that we should leave to make room for other guests.  The appetizers were yummy and hit the spot, and we were checked on by two different managers. The menu is huge with a little bit of everything. Definitely beats the food court when it comes to wanting a nice comfortable sit down place to eat."}
{"text":"ALways a wait to get in... my tip: get a babysitter for your kids & sit at the bar. There is always room there!!! You also get quicker service & better attention on your drinks :) Try the fish tacos, they are sooooooo good! I am not a fish taco kinda gal, but since Ive tried thiers, Im obsessed & i CRAVE Them!"}
{"text":"Omg! The cod fish tacos are to die for! I've been craving them ever since I tried them! The service was great and the food was high quality for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I went to Thirsty Lion today to watch the Niners vs Seahawks on television   The first thing the server does as we look at the regular menu is hand us the Happy Hour menu.  I ordered a Kona Longboard Ale (Haven't seen that brand on tap in months) and with a group, we split the Happy Hour appetizers. --Scotch eggs were pretty amazing. --I wish we had more chicken strips, but the dipping sauces were amazing (the ranch especially after we got fries as well) --I highly recommend the edamame.  It's very flavorful  We were well-attended by the staff and the food was delivered efficiently and in perfect temperature.  I don't look for things to complain about, so I didn't find anything wrong with this place.  It has a very nice modern, classy look to it.  FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"We had never eaten at this restaurant, however with our ticket from Desert Stages Theatre (also located in the mall) we received 1/2 off before or after the show.   We walked through the mall to the location to find an amazing staff and even more amazing food!   We tried two of their Pizzas and a bottle of wine.   Both pizza were great and the dough was exceptional!   There was NO crust left at our table.   We will be doing this again soon!"}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time. Definitely not returning. Wait staff was miserable.  Tried the calamari and shepherds pie. The pie tastes like left overs that got smashed together and served luke warm on a hot plate. The calamari was the most rubbery thing I've ever eaten. The manager or who ever he was took them off our bill which was nice. But other then his kindness it was definitely not a good dinner. Over priced left overs was our experience."}
{"text":"We had heard Thirsty Lion had recently opened and tried to beat the dinner crowds by going around happy hour time (4:45) on a Saturday evening. The place was packed and we were quoted an HOUR wait for two. We reluctantly decided to stick around and wait (have you ever tried to get out of the San Tan Marketplace parking lot at 5PM on a Saturday?).  Seems like the reason for the long wait was a mass abundance of Opentable reservations. We are sort of new to the whole \"being constricted to eating out in the Chandler - Gilbert suburbs\" thing (as opposed to driving to wherever we feel like for dinner - Tempe, Scottsdale, Arcadia, etc), so this Opentable thing was a bit of a surprise to us (apparently housewives like to make their freakishly early dinner reservations WAY in advance). Anyway, going forward we will be utilizing Opentable and planning ahead instead of winging it since we are tired of 45+ minute waits EVERYWHERE we try to go on a Saturday EARLY evening in Suburbia.  Our table was ready promptly at a little under the hour wait they had quoted us. We were seated on the patio and our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and timely. We had the scotch eggs (great), the beer cheese soup (rich but very good), the shrimp tacos (hubby raved about them) and the salmon with risotto (delicious).    We highly enjoyed the atmosphere and food and will be back. If they can perform this well during their first weekend open, I look forward to seeing what they can do once they have been open longer."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had at a pub.  Outrageously good burgers and salads."}
{"text":"So many restaurants these days seem to think when it comes to their menus, quantity makes up for quality.  the more lackluster dishes they can squeeze onto a page, the more likely you'll find one that is less terrible than the rest....  Thirsty Lion proved to be a shining exception in this regard.  Our dinner Saturday night was excellent, and though their menu was perhaps as long as those other restaurants, that proved to be the only thing they had in common.  We loved every dish!  From the hostess to the GM, every member of the Staff impressed us with their professionalism.  Maybe we caught them all on a good night, but watching the kitchen tear down (we were among the last guests for the evening)  was an unexpected highlight; so rare to see great teamwork in the workplace.    We went with a few of their specialties. A smoked Chicken Waldorf Salad, sausage flatbread pizza, tempura green beens, and their infamous fish and chips.  The Manager told us they go through something like 30 kegs of IPA every month just in the batter!  The most popular dish on their menu, it proved to be every bit as good as its reputation would suggest :)  Very pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Gilbert, we'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion is now at the top of my list anytime I'm in the area and looking for an awesome spot to watch sports or start the night with friends. The atmosphere is upbeat and lively with various large seating areas with a variety of table options. The bar also has plenty of seating with abundant TVs for easy viewing. There are great happy hour options for food and drink with an abundant beer list. We only tried the appetizers while we were there, but I HIGHLY recommend the reuben sliders and garlic sesame edamame. Also, there is a local stout called Papago Elsie's Irish Coffee Stout - mind blowing! If you are into that kind of thing try it. I'm looking forward to visiting AZ again just to pick some up."}
{"text":"It's a bar, it's a restaurant, it's not bad for a chain. They have quite a selection of beers, and I love their pretzels- their dipping sauce has beer in it! The cobb salad was good, and my friend enjoyed the baked mac and cheese. It's a good place to go when you can't think of anywhere else and want a broad selection of food. And beer."}
{"text":"We love the Thirsty Lion, always great service and beer choices! However, the menu seems to have an identity crisis...it's supposed to be an English style pub so why are they serving sushi? It's not even good sushi"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak salad and was not impressed.  The salad was pretty small and had a bit too much dressing on it.  The steak meat was poor quality, chewy, and flavorless.  For $14 I expected better.  My friend's dinners did not look that impressive either.  The pizzas seemed regular, as did the sushi rolls.  Also, not really our server's fault, but they did not have enough servers on the floor on a Friday night.  so our server was really busy and we were really hungry but had to wait about 15 minutes to place our food orders.  we kept looking for our server to get her attention so we could place our order, but she was either nowhere to be found or occupied with another table and didn't glance over at us as she just went back into the kitchen."}
{"text":"Left a negative review in June, management said that they would follow-up with me, nothing to date.....Why am I not surprised...."}
{"text":"Interesting spot at the Fashion Square Mall. They have a good selection of craft beers and a daily happy hour from 3-7 and a reverse from 9 to close, with good food and drink specials. They have 2 nice size bars with TV's at each. The service was friendly and the staff was informative about the menu and drinks. I would return and check it out again."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was delicious and cooked to perfection.  The wait was a little long but what do you expect when the line to get in is out the door."}
{"text":"I've been to other Thirsty Lion's and have always been happy. This location was no exception. My wife and I care for date night and had a great experience.  We both ordered craft cocktails, which were well-made and reasonably priced.  She had the Lion Lemonade and I had the Passion Fruit Mojito.  Both were excellent.  Their spring menu was tempting, but we ordered from the regular menu.  My wife had the fish and chips.  They were so good that she had gobbled it up before I could even ask for a bite.  She said the fish was moist and flaky.  I had their version of a Cuban. It was a great blend of flavors with pork, ham, Swiss cheese, jalapeños, pickles, and their own sauce.  Yum!  I even liked the side salad with their blue cheese vinaigrette.  For dessert, the chocolate porter brownie...a taste explosion.  To top it off, it was a relaxed atmosphere with great service (thanks, Jared) will definitely add this to our short list of date night favorites."}
{"text":"Good food....but very loud!!  If you want to have a conversation with your group it's best to pick another place!"}
{"text":"#300:  After going back and forth between 4 or 5 stars, I've settled with 5 but it's probably closer to 4.5 if I were to be honest ---- 4 for food, 5 for service, ambiance, and overall experience.  Plus, I had a lovely complimentary VIP Yelp Elite meal with the best group of friends ever!  Be jealous because they're pretty awesome.  \"Good food is all the sweeter when shared with good friends.\" ? Heck should I know but #truth!  It was a sunny Friday in classy Scottsdale when I walked in.  The blue-eyed gentleman, my personal Mister Luck, Tom D. met up with us from the bar.  We were 15 minutes late but Kazi H. was even more late as always but she's a hottie so it's okay.  Anyways, after being led to our table where we were graciously informed that purse hooks were available under the table, we sat down and paid no attention to the menu.  We're terrible people like that.  But really, who sits down at a restaurant to order food when there's much hugging and bantering to be had?  Patrick, our server who we renamed as Patrique, had the patience of a saint.  We were indecisive, a bit ADHD, and all our dietary habits and quirks made sharing difficult.  Let's face it, we all want to share to try more of the menu right?  Tomcat bought us some drinks, that cheeky sweet guy, and soon Kazi and I were guzzling her not-so-great Blood Orange Cosmo and my amazing Grapefruit & Basil Martini.  What a great Friday!  We had ordered Bacon Wrapped Dates, Shrimp Ceviche, Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer, Seared Ahi Entree Salad, Chicken Penne & Gorgonzola Cream, Grilled Sirloin Steak, Grilled Atlantic Salmon, and the creme brûlée [because if you know Kazi and me, we can't resist brûlée!].  I won't bore you with all the details but portions were plenty and I would say out of the eight things ordered, I think we really enjoyed six of them.  The two not enjoyed as much came from the same person who ordered the blah Cosmo *cough*Kazi*cough*.    Notes:  Those bacon wrapped dates were sooo good.  Truly a flavor explosion, had lots of interesting textures, and probably my favorite bite of the day!  Between the saintly gentleman and all his good Catholic no-meat Friday, my YFF who has given up sugar, and my Kazi-love who doesn't eat pork, I was scared that I ended up ordering a whole appetizer by myself but they stepped up to be true friends by splitting two dates between the three of them despite their food restrictions.  These guys... it's love!  Also to note, I think the brûlée had good flavor but please put the torch on it longer.  I love breaking a crispy caramelized shell.  I was a sad panda when my spoon just sunk into it as if it were pudding.  :(  Easily fixable though so keep doing what you're doing!  Anyways, lunch was amazing.  Great service, gorgeous restaurant, and even the restrooms were nice!  Had I had Kazi in there with me, much selfies could have been had.  Thank you, Thirsty Lion, for allowing us four to come in for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Every time I have eaten there the food takes forever and the waitress messes up something! Usually one of our entrees is cold. We have never been overly impressed with this place. I would say the thirsty lion is good after a long night of drinker and it's the only place open. The girls dress cute and they are always very nice. But that's all that it has going for it. Not impressed."}
{"text":"The night started out with a wonderful drink.  Then we got the food.  It was nothing short of just okay.  I ordered the cheese beer soup.  It was so thick I could've eaten it with a fork.  Not what i'm looking for in soup.  My daughter had a Caesar salad.  Again, just okay.  I will not go back.  The best part of the experience was the hostess.  She had on extremely high heeled shoes.  You could tell it was excruciating for her to walk.  She limped and cringed every step of the way to our table and back to the hostess stand.  When her shift was over, she stood next to the stand in her barefoot. Not cool in a restaurant. Who wears 4 inch heals to work when you're a hostess?"}
{"text":"I ate here on Labor Day Sept 4, 2017 for first time ever, due to $15 for $30 Groupon going to expire.  I already selected the 12 oz ribeye for $29.95 to be my $30 item before purchasing the voucher.  When I ordered the ribeye off the menu which the server specified just the way I would say it, but he spoke first \"mediumrare/rare.  I said I just want to make sure it is red on the inside but not raw so it is hard to chew.  When it already arrived, my server told me that my ribeye only cost $23.95 and I must order more to make $30, so perhaps I would like to pick an appetizer.  WOW, really?   He told me that the rib eye WAS $23.95 about a month ago, but the menu changed and prices increased due to the $10 minimum wage law.   I told him that I SAW that the ribeye was $29.95 on the website menu AND on the menu he just took away.  He went away.  The ribeye looked the way I wanted it when I first cut into it, but later, I saw the rest of it was medium instead of mediumrare/rare.  The server came back twice to check on me, but I did not say anything to the server about it being medium, because I didn't want the cow to be wasted as they would throw away what I send back.  I got to thinking that $23.95 to $29.95 was a huge price increase for $10 minimum wage.  Later a woman came to talk to me.  She was the manager.  She told me that he got the price mixed up with the sirloin that was $24.95, and that they did not have a price change this year, the ribeye was always $29.95.   I held the steak up to her, and showed her the inside.  I asked what would she label the way it looked.   She said medium/medium rare.  I said I wanted medium rare/rare, red on the inside, not pink.  'But I am not sending it back because I hate to waste\".  She did not offer any words of remedy.    I just ate at Fogo de Chaos last Thursday, and I wrote in my Yelp review, that I could see how red the meat was, and say I want THAT red part, and that most of the time in other restaurants, I just settle for what comes out of the kitchen, it is rarely \"just right\".  This is one of those situations.    Steak was served with asparagus which was fibrous (spit it out), even towards the upper half.  Mashed potatoes was good, but not more than a 'B\".  I ate here a second time, about a month later, ordered the same steak, which I said I want it RED on the inside.  It was served to me well come!   not even pink on the inside, which the server acknowledged and agreed fully and took the steak back. Server said I TOLD the cook to make it rare!!!!  It took a long time before I got another steak, but this time, was cooked to my satisfaction.    When I got my bill, unlike the first time, it came with a \"comment card\".  Well I started writing and writing and writing !  I guess the manager (a man this time, not the woman who visited me before) was watching me write on that comment card!   He came over, ssaid he was the manager, and asked me if there was anything he could do for me, and if everything was OK.  I told him all the above story.    Well he gave me a $20 gift card, which I have not yet used.  All this was last year but I am not changing my 2 star story because of the gift card.  Someday i will use it and hopefully have a better experience with the steak.  The steak itself, when cooked right (red on the inside) is quite Yummy!  ."}
{"text":"We are waiting for our food. Seated in the bar area, but against the wall. This is definitely not the main dining room. Our waitress has been attentive and took our order promptly. So far so good.  Issues so far: we were seated in a corner right under a huge flatscreen tv. Epileptics would be thrashing around on the floor from the flashing and scene changing on the tv. There should never be a tv this close to a seat.  The music is awful droning Strip club rock. Why? How appetizing is a headache? Hopefully the food is better than the environment.  We ordered fish tacos and a sirloin steak.   Talk amongst yourselves while we wait.  The music has become more jarring if that is possible.the food is just ok Not great but mediocre enough to eat  Not a repeat destination"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried the Thirsty Lion for the first time a couple days ago and were very impressed! Billie J was our waitress and took amazing care of us.  The food was good, and the beer selections were awesome!  Billie was on point with recommendations! Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Good food, wide variety of options, extremely busy. Not sure if staff is poorly distributed because I see a lot of managers walking around in the distance but service is minimal."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic, I've been there so many times and every time the food is served quickly and the food is amazing. They have such a great variety on food and drinks. There's 52 beers on tap and idk if ill ever get to to trying them all when the time comes. I love the environment, sports, great music and awesome employees and managers. I definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour. They have really good deals and food was great. Was yummy and service was great. Alex and Alison were the bartenders that served me. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food here is just average. I expected more and was pretty disappointed with the quality of the food. It was also very dark, loud, and the service was really slow."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I did a pizza and movie ticket deal with a friend.  My Italian friend loves eating pizza, but she and I were both not fond of their pizza here.  It was dry and the ingredients did not taste that great.  However, I came here another day for happy hour with my friend, and fell in love with their calamari.  It has a very tasty dipping sauce that comes with it and the calamari is very good.  The happy hour prices for alcohol weren't too bad either.  We both had a lot of homework, and I was very surprised that no one question us about having our computers on in the dark bar area.  (We honestly had a lot of work to do!)  We did this a second time, and the calamari was just as good again and no one complained to us about doing work there.  If you love calamari or got some work and need to drink during work, this is the place to go for me :)"}
{"text":"The Thirsty Lion is a great blend of authentic pub and modern restaurant. The food is good, and the seating is nice and large for groups, soccer matches, etc. Prices are a little high, but I think you pay for the experience, which is definitely a good one."}
{"text":"Kinda wish the Italian restaurant was still open :/ virtually same layout/decor and really no diff from yardhouse?! Expensive, not very good happy hr & indifferent service. Too much better product out there."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beers on tap!! The Cubano Sam was excellent! Spicy and juicy. The spicy Mac could be a touch spicier, but I like hot."}
{"text":"Here visiting from San Diego and came to the Thirsty Lion for my brothers birthday. Celina was amazing and took great care of us. She even gave my brother a birthday card signed by the staff- such a great touch! Excellent service and will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"forgot the exact name of the dish but i got the chicken w pasta and it looked like a lil kid made the dish. i had no clue that it was basically going to be macaroni with some string beans and 2 fried boneless chicken breasts lmao. i did not like the mac n cheese underneath, but i ate the veggies and took the extra chicken home. our waiter, however, was great and super friendly. gave us lots of tips since we were vising AZ."}
{"text":"the staff is gorgeous, the food is great, pricing is reasonable.  hard to park during xmas season as they are in Tempe Marketplace, but otherwise, very lively."}
{"text":"Happy Hour - only Coors Light and a Cider.  Craft beer? Nope.  Fail.  It's as if they're not even trying to compete with Yard House for happy hour, not even 30 second walk from the door here, and you'll find craft beer discounted there.  Nice, clean decor similar to other Thirsty Lion locations.  Just wish they had a decent happy hour."}
{"text":"Finally good taps and food in the Tempe marketplace, for the craft beer kind of person.  Sure there's other beer options in Tempe, but most are riddled with annoying college kids.  52 taps with mostly everyday craft beers that you can find in decent grocery stores, and prices weren't too bad for the 20 oz. size (cheaper than Yardhouse, thank God!).    Service was outstanding for me, with use of my name, handshake, prompt order & delivery of drinks, etc.  I thought the food items were a little pricey for what the items were, such as $10 for a couple of cut up pretzels with cheese/fondue dipping sauce.  Open and clean atmosphere was nice as well.  Immaculate restrooms!"}
{"text":"Loved the seared ahi tuna!! It's out of this world! My wife had the Pork Tenderloin with a Dark Cherry Sauce from the special winter menu --- it definitely deserves a place on the regular menu - DELICIOUS!!! The service was awesome as always, including the manger who stopped by a few times just to make sure we were all taken care of. Oh, and before I forget, their Edamame is so good that eating it anywhere else pales in comparison."}
{"text":"You must... My stake was cooked to perfection! It was one of the best stakes, mashed and asparagus combo I have had. Service was good and the restaurant itself is nice. I have also had one of the pizza's and it was fabulous it was a quick bite before the movies and It hit the spot."}
{"text":"I went in last night with my fiancée to grab a \"quick\" bite to eat before a movie. It took 15 minutes to receive my beer and his soda. I ordered the French Dip and he ordered the Caprese chicken sandwich. His sandwich was delicious! My French dip was dry and resembled beef jerky. With mass amounts of Ajus the sandwich was a little better. The service was so slow we ended up missing our movie."}
{"text":"Tuesday evening just before happy hour service ends (5:45pm ).  We were seated right away at a spacious round table.  The Happy Hour menu was nice, snuck in for some $4 margaritas that were very good but lots of ice.... not much marg.  Still drank 2 as they were not heavy on mixer rather fresh and tasty.    Service was a bit slow... slow for drinks, slow for water refills and my daughter asked for some aioli on the side which the waitress needed asked twice for.  It wasn't that they were too busy, just wasn't that gals fastest night.  That may/may not be an ongoing issue so if you're in a rush consider that but for us, it was not a big deal... just noted even getting the check picked up was slow.    The menu is large with cuisine to appeal to anyone.  It was good, I'd return if someone suggested it or more likely, to stop for happy hour and a few snacks.  I think that's where they may shine.  If you're a pretzel fan get the oven baked pretzel with beer fondue, that too was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Thirsty Lion?  You're missin out!  This place is the best in TMP right next to Bar Louie.  Thirsty Lion is a quality pub with fabulous food and customer service.  I don't think I've ever had the same thing twice in this place, just doesn't seem right!  I will say the sliders are delicious as well as the nachos!  (My favorites so far.)  The atmosphere is great in here because it's not too loud, it's huge and it's right next to everything.  I recommend going here when you don't feel like going out for a crazy night of beers or a good place to start the evening.  Either way, if you haven't been....go.  :)"}
{"text":"Crazy day, just wanted to get some food and chill. So bummed that we came here. Different experience than Tempe. Seated and waited almost 30 mins for a server. Manager (Sean) eventually stops by. Cool guy, but offers comp desert to people who don't partake desert. Food ok, service mediocre, total experience very underwhelming. Wish I would have went home and cooked."}
{"text":"This place is great. First of all out server Vinny was absolutely amazing and so sweet. We ordered ceviche which was super tasty! I ordered the enchiladas and I couldn't stop offering them to my whole table - they were so good! My husband got the fish tacos which he loved! All in all we loved it here and will be back! Hopefully Vinny will be working too!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Billy J. Was a fabulous waitress.  The ALCS game was on the television and me and my buddies had a great time."}
{"text":"If you are thirsty, stay away Appetizer is cold and served with dinner Portions are small Food is bland"}
{"text":"Seating was good; it was a busy Sunday afternoon and lots of soccer fans were watching the U.S. game. Our server was friendly and helpful and the beer was ice cold. Lots of choices on tap and we found a few that suited us perfectly. Nice ambience - thanks a bunch!!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give the Thirsty Lion 2.5 starts... but I cannot round up to 3. We went for lunch today and it was well staffed, actually over staffed with 4 greeters upon arrival. With all the help, service was still slow....   The real problem came when we reviewed the menu. The Thirsty Lion used to have wonderful English pub fare and an amazing beer selection. We were disappointed to see overly priced standard bar food was the flavor of the day. Everything from sushi to bbq pizza to flatbread to fish tacos... Come on, how about some shepard pie or bangers and mash? In addition, now about a lunch menu that doesn't start at $14/plate.   All in all... really average food with below average service."}
{"text":"I waited to review the gilbert location until after I gave it an honest shot however it continued to disappoint since after the opening weekend. This review is strictly based on the service my fiance and I have received now multiple times. Poor..and that is a tactful understatement. We have been ignored at our table now on more than 1 occasion. We have had to flag down our service for drinks or correction to our meals and even as we sit here tonight our server dropped the check without saying a word. The majority of the employees do not look happy and appear to be very stressed. My fiance and I don't typically hold back in cost when we go out and we found it hard to spend money here just because of the service we were given.  This review is based on 3 separate visits, I have had multiple good experiences at the location in tempe. I challenge you to make that trip for better service."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a not very busy Friday night for a bite to eat before a movie.  I like the dark wood decor- makes you want to get cozy and order a drink, which is what I did. Two things blew me away- the grapefruit basil martini with a perfect sugar rim. It was lovely!   And the poke stack, which was fresh, a nice portion size, and tasted heavenly. We also ordered the kung pao which was pretty good.  The manager was walking around checking on tables and the service was efficient. For the portion sizes I don't think the prices are too bad. Meals could be shared. We missed happy hour but I am going to make it a point to get to it another time."}
{"text":"Food excellent..presentation of plates very impressive..Nicole the bartender is the best"}
{"text":"I have been to Thirsty Lion 5 or 6 times.  I have had good and bad experiences with wait staff.  Their food is actually pretty good.  The environment is great.  I'd go back, but wouldn't rave to friends."}
{"text":"I received a postcard in the mail for a free birthday entree at this location (up to $20 value). We started with the nachos. I have generally been disappointed by nachos at restaurants lately. Usually just a bag of chips with just a few toppings tossed on before heating. I was glad to find this pub style restaurant makes them the way they should be. Every chip with at least some delicious topping on it. We split the entree, a grilled salmon and asparagus risotto. It was delicious. They kindly split it into two plates. It was devoured quickly. In general this place has a great English pub feel. However, I still prefer the one at Tempe Marketplace just a few miles away. This is a great place for a lunch or early dinner while shopping at the state's top mall. It will also be great when the new Harkin's Theater opens a few hundred yards away. But, when looking for that destination dinner the stand-alone Tempe location is my preferred choice."}
{"text":"Had lunch with the Wifey here last Thursday and we had the best food, and the best server! We sat down and Holly made us feel like royalty. The food was outstanding as usual, you really cant go wrong here. What was a bonus was to have a server that knew when to ask if we needed something, when to get us refills, when to put our order in after allowing us time to enjoy the Thai Curry soup. Nice work Holly!"}
{"text":"Went out here with my mother and brother after a long week. Sat outside and was pretty nice, though a bit hard to get service. Our waitress didn't really know what was on the seasonal menu, but there wasn't anything interesting on there anyways. Ordered sirloin medium rare with mixed vegetables ($22). My mother ordered the same thing. We both received filets with green beans. Our steaks were cooked totally differently. Mine was medium-medium-rare and hers was medium-rare (as ordered). The green beans were hilariously undercooked. Waitress came by once after giving us our food and didn't try to do anything to correct the overcooked steak apart from offering me barbecue sauce to make it less dry...    Overall, everything was pretty mediocre, and for a $105 bill for three people, this was comically bad. Learn how to cook steaks or don't serve them."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and worth visiting. But the food is lacking. I had the Kung pao chicken and the chicken was too well done. My jaw hurts after chewing it. But I'd come back and try something else"}
{"text":"This place was packed for a Tuesday night!  Thankfully I made an open table reservation for 6:30 pm.  I had ordered off their winter menu:  Black Cherry BBQ Pork Tenderloin* Apple brine marinated and grilled with ginger black cherry BBQ glaze. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and bacon sautéed Brussels sprouts. 17.95.  It was pretty tasty although I felt the tenderloin was a little overcooked.  The brussel sprouts were delicious.  The service was great - our server was attentive. I would definitely come back here again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I was invited to come have lunch compliments of Thirsty Lion.   Upon arriving, we were greeted by the hostess who was very friendly.  She and another hostess debated on where to seat us - and the 1st hostess suggested a low top since my guest was quite short.  I'm glad she noticed. :)    Our server approached shortly after, and I am so mad I forgot her name, but she was courteous, friendly and knew her stuff.  We started off with the calamari and the bbq bacon wrapped prawns.  Both were delicious and the prawns were quite large and meaty.  Ashley, the event coordinator also stopped by to introduce herself - she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu.   For entrees, I ordered the pork cubano - I have to admit, this was my least favorite dish of the 3 that we ordered.  There were 2 types of meat in there and one of them was just not hitting my taste buds right. I actually couldn't finish it.  The fries that came with it were delicious though.  Perfectly crunchy.  Another person at our table ordered the filet mignon over mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The filet was perfectly cooked at medium rare and tasted divine.  The texture was great.  And the 3rd person at our table had the salmon risotto - that was hands down, the favorite of the table.  It was creamy and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I'd definitely order that dish again.    For dessert, though full, our server suggested the blackberry cobbler with a scoop of ice cream on top.  It was great and the 3 of us shared it.  Without the sweetness of the ice cream, it would have been a bit tart, but with the ice cream, made it perfect.   Overall, our experience was wonderful.  Extremely friendly staff, food presentation was impressive and food was great (minus the cubano...sorry!).    Thank you for having us and we will definitely be back to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"Nice environment- 4 stars for fancy British style digs. The bathrooms are even cool. I can't remember what it was before but the place is nice looking.   Food- Meh, it's a Gastropub but we hit happy hour so the plates they had were a great deal. The food was okay maybe 3 and a half stars. Nothing great and nothing bad, with the exception of the chili cheddar potato cakes. I loved those! The sliders were good inside but the bread was either too hard or over toasted, I prefer the roll softer. The Calamari was okay but not the best I have ever had by a long shot. I liked the sauce that came with it. The St. Patty's Day themed Whiskey bread Pudding was good. We demolished that. Again, not the best I have had but this is not a five star, chef restaurant.   I say go. It is a nice place. The happy hour deals are great and the food is good. The place was crowded when we went and they were short staffed but we still got good service."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be invited to try out Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill as part of a promo for Yelp Elites.   I got here shortly after opening on a weekday.  The place was nearly empty, but a few tables started to fill up as we were leaving.  I ordered an iced tea and the Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack.  I inquired about the side of beans and was told they have lard and bacon as an ingredient, so I asked if I could substitute something else.  They offered me a side salad, which worked out great.  The portion of the enchiladas was sufficient for lunch and I had a little food leftover.  If I had ordered this at dinner, I might be a little hungry after.  The flavor was really good on its own.  Once I sliced the roasted chile that was served with it... that kicked it up to a great flavor!  My stepbrother ordered the Classic Reuben sandwich.  It came with fries.  He ate every crumb off his plate.  He said he was surprised at how good it was!  He said the cheese was perfectly melted and enhanced the flavor of the sandwich.  He even said the fries were perfectly salted and he does not normally like to eat fries.    We were offered dessert, but we declined.  The space was really nice.  I loved the lighting fixtures.  They were very modern, but I felt like I had seen them in another nearby restaurant that closed in the last year.    I had to deduct a point for the service.  The waitress disappeared for a long while and I was waiting for quite a while for a refill.  That said, the manager did stop by and ask how we were doing.  Within a moment of him stopping by, a refill appeared.  I would definitely return to this location of Thirsty Lion again.  I think the menu is slightly different from the Tempe location.  It is such a large restaurant that I think it would be nice to come here for a future happy hour.  Thank you Thirsty Lion and Yelp!"}
{"text":"Guess what?  I love this place!  We stopped in for a pizza and some apps on Sunday afternoon.  Let me first say... the service is EXCELLENT and friendly.  The hostess was genuinely nice (and super cute for you male readers).  The waitress was awesome (and also super cute) and very friendly, despite our having a toddler with us who wanted so badly to get up and dance in the aisle for the last half of the meal.    The bathrooms were SPARKLING clean.    The food was... GREAT BAR FOOD!  The Roasted Artichoke and Spinach pizza was pretty flavorful (and a great bargain at $12.95).    The $8.95 Ultimate Nachos could EASILY feed 4 to 6 people.  They were loaded up and delicious.  Even the chicken strips from the child menu were delicious!  The fries were soggy, but that's so minor.  I will definitely be back for either their Monday Night $19.95 special (2 Harkins Movie Tix, 2 soft drinks, any 1 pizza) or their Happy Hour.    UYE Anyone?"}
{"text":"My friend and I received complimentary invites to dine at this restaurant on Thursday afternoon. Since I am off work this week (which is rare), we were more than happy to come here and check out the restaurant in Scottsdale.   Location: the restaurant is very well decorated both in the bar and dining area. You don't need to go inside the mall to get into the restaurant. It is clean, relaxing, with few TVs in the bar area if you want to go there and watch sports.   Service: The service was excellent! The hostesses were nice and so was our waitress. She was super attentive and sweet the entire time. She kept coming back to check up on us to make sure we've got everything that we need. Not even once she gave us any attitude knowing that we were here from yelp. I cannot be happier and we made sure to tip her well.   Food: We ordered a total of 3 appetizers: Sesame Ahi Tuna, Traditional Scotch Eggs and Shrimp Ceviche. They are all delicious. The Sesame Ahi Tuna is cooked on the outta layer only and fresh in the inside. The shrimp Ceviche has the right amount of shrimps and seasoning. As for the main entree, we both ordered the Fillet Mignon. It was cooked to my liking. However, it was a bit too salty. No worries - ill ask them to go easy on salt next time.   As for dessert, we ordered a creme brulee and it was soooooooo delicious. It was sweet but not too overpowering. I cannot think of any better way to end our meals.   Rating: I will definitely come back here again to hang out with friends. Thanks for the wonderful complimentary meals!"}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to a family gathering at one of my favorite restaurant chain's new locations, Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill - SanTan, and this is also going on Trip Advisor... We had one of the worst restaurant experiences we've had in years. First - TURN DOWN THE MUSIC. We went for a family lunch, not for disco dancing. Second, due to the music that rattled the windows, our server completely screwed up our order. Of the 7 of us, 5 got what they ordered and I got no food at all; I had to make lunch for myself when I got home. The manager never came by as promised by our server; our server blamed the kitchen; at times there were no bartenders at their stations, and we sat with empty glasses for 28 minutes; empty plates and glasses were not cleared - this restaurant is a total write off. Would get no stars at all if that was an option - and to anyone seeing this post - don't waste your time or money. Go to the Tempe location if you like this restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good gastropub since visiting London, and my best friend took me here for my birthday. I had so much fun!!! First off, let me just say that this is a busy mall area, so do what we did and make reservations a day in advance. People complain about long wait times, but we had no problem at all - because we made reservations. I think this must be a forgotten art - when we walked in, the hostesses seemed so surprised. Surprised, but happy to help, I'll say. We had a high table in the middle of the place with tall stools - very possibly the most comfortable stools in existence. They're big and cushy and didn't hurt my legs. Lol. They had the Windows open, allowing a lovely breeze to go through the establishment, which was refreshing. Our server was so nice and the food was good. We got scotch eggs, which were perfect. In our group, two of us had the fish and chips, another had a bbq chicken pizza and the fourth had the chicken Waldorf salad. Fish was the best I've had since London, if a bit on the smaller size. Coleslaw was delicious. The smoked chicken in the Waldorf Salad was so smoky, you could smell it from across the table - wow! It was amazing-good.  When our server found out it was my birthday, he brought out the most amazing hot fudge sundae - and a card signed my the staff! It was so adorable, I loved it!! He sang happy birthday, it was low key, nothing weird or embarrassing like at some places.  Overall, it was a wonderful evening with good food and fun. I'll say it again - Do it old school and just make reservations. This isn't McDonald's or Taco Bell - don't just show up and then be grumpy that it took so long to be seated. It's new, the staff is still finding their groove, waiting 10 minutes might turn into 20 - especially when people like me and my group are having such a nice time, we're not eager to leave!  So just call ahead, you'll have an amazing night. One of my happiest birthdays ever."}
{"text":"This place seems to be staffed by high school teenagers trying to hook up with each other. Very unprofessional.  That said the service was fine but lacked finesse.   Reasonable range of drinks but music way to loud and way to many TVs. Place was dark and sprawling."}
