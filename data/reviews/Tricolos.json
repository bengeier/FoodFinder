{"text":"Lovely place. Fantastic Steaks for £13.95 if ordered before 6.30pm.  Calzone Carnivore is amazing - allow 20 mins cooking time !"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst meal I ever had. The tomato sauce had a metallic tang and was bereft of seasoning. My pizza was a gloopy mess and impossible to eat. I'd hazard it was merely forgotton about on a low temperature (idiot setting.) The service was blasé at best and upon my comments no offer was made to change any part of the meal.    If children are taken here reguarly then I worry that the food here shall merely serve as an offputting memory of Italian food."}
{"text":"Another great Italian, but not the best. The food is perfect, but the prices are not."}
{"text":"Another solid three and a half star restaurant, Tricolos has been around for years under various ownerships.    Predominantly an Italian themed restaurant, that doesnt restrict the menu to simply pizza and pasta - they also do a nice line in burgers and steaks. The food is always fresh and tasty and never takes long to arrive at your table.    Service is excellent - in fact this is the standout feature of this place. In recent times service has improved tenfold, and noticeably so compared to times gone by. Staff cope admirably with volume.    Prices are reasonable - you can get cheaper, but you tend to get what you pay for, so its pretty good value, the atmosphere is always lively.    Theres also a room available for hire for party bookings, which is well worth considering in the run up to Christmas time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, food always been good. Burgers are home made and very nice. Took some friends from away here recently and they thoroughly enjoyed it. Reasonably priced food, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, slightly overpriced but food generally tasty. I personally didn't have any problems with the service but others say different.Not the beat Italian restaurant around but worth a visit to compare."}
{"text":"I have been to this Italian themed resturant several times over the last 5 years and had found it improving with every visit until this year. It was a Friday evening so the place was busy and quite lively as you would expect. We ordered pasta and pizza and it took about 30 minutes to arrive so a little on the slow side and my pizza was badly burned underneath, it ruined the taste and made the base far too crispy so I asked for a new pizza and had quite an argument with the waitress, the floor manager finally intervend and gave us a new pizza. The waitress was then slow and rude for the rest of our time there and charged us for both pizzas which again the floor manager sorted out and apologised for. So this was not a pleasent dining experience. The food is reasonably priced and if you don't have a problem with the food it was good dining but the staff service has put me off going here agian for some time."}
{"text":"A good, basic Italian - in a pleasant themed surrounding. I enjoyed my meal here; the food as relatively average but wholesome. I personally felt the cost was a little high for the standard. Service was friendly and efficient and you were left to enjoy the food that was delivered.  Would I go back, maybe. Would I recommend to a friend? Unlikely."}
{"text":"I first went here about ten years ago and found it expensive rubbish. Now under new management with exciting new cooks I was eager to give the new place a chance. I found it to be expensive rubbish in a fancy body suit. My main was a rare sirloin in a blue cheese sauce. What I got was a tough old boot, riddled with fat and sinew, covered in a sickly, white runny substance which tasted like off milk. It was horrible. Never again. But most amazing was that we were only three of about 8 customers in there and the alleged chef was not that busy. I would hate to eat here during a busy period. Yuch"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. My rustic pizza was sooooo good!!!!! Cheap, cheerful, worth checking out!!"}
