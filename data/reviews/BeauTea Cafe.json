{"text":"A hidden gem! I LOVE their Mango and Taro Milkshakes! I believe they offer daily specials on drinks too :)  Pros: -Friendly staff -Clean, fun atmosphere -Reasonably priced with generous portions  Cons: -This might be a con for some so I will mention it. It's a small place, so seating isn't plentiful. I agree with the other reviewer that states that the place can seat approx. 20-25 people. I have never had issues with finding a spot however, so this isn't really a con for me!  These guys are truly a favourite! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cool place to chill. Drinks are awesome, definitely one of the best in Toronto"}
{"text":"Excellent service, price is good for what you get, environment is nice too! One of the best bubble tea places in downtown =]"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The drinks are usually tasty and prepared quickly and the staff are friendly. I think the prices are too high for this section of Yonge street with about five other places selling bubble tea cheaper within line of sight from here. They charge extra for tapioca just in case the prices weren't high enough to start with. The quality of the drinks also varies wildly depending who is working sometimes it's the best bubble tea in the area other times it's watery. On a few occassions I've been treated to crunchy chunks of unmixed powder in my drink. I'd say 90% of the time my experience here is awesome. 10% of the time I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for Fresh taro every week! Cant stop it.    Gonna miss Fresh Taro after leaving Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. They have daily specials from Mon-Fri. The best is the Fresh Taro Milkshake. Tastes so good and fresh and very refreshing i usually can drink 3 of these on the special day which is $3.49 for regular size. The seating area is quite small id say it sits up to 20-25 people at one time. Its very clean and cutsie looking with 3 teddy bears in front of the store. Its quite hidden on Yonge St, Be sure to look out for it. I have tried almost every drink here and there all good my favourites are of course the Fresh Taro, anything Fresh Fruit Slushie and Passion fruit Green Tea. They make good tapioca here! The side foods popcorn chicken and toast is quite good. Be sure to ask for a stamp card here as you can collect 10 stamps and redeem for a free drink. The customer service is very excellent here, the only thing is that if there is 2 or more people waiting the wait can be long so expect long wait times during peak hours. There is free WiFi feel free to ask for the password and the wash rooms are private and clean. Ill definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"4.75 stars!  Beautea is one of my favorite tea places!! I actually TASTE REAL TEA in my drink (had green apple green tea). It's so delicious. The taro milk tea also literally tastes like fresh taros. I wish this place was down the street from me. I'd be there every day.  The shop is pretty small but decorated cutely. The staff are really friendly and take their time to make your tea. My friend comes here all the time and told me the staff all know what he'll order. Quite attentive."}
{"text":"Really really friendly staff and amazingly delicious and refreshing bubble teas. The owner here cares a lot about customer satisfaction and it shows.   The lychee banana bubble tea was the best I ever had in my life! I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I was never really into Taro... but my tastebuds have changed lately and I'm always looking for the freshest real Taro in the city.  After reading some reviews on Yelp (thanks yelpers), and checking out the photos.. I noticed that Beau Tea had a Fresh Taro special happening on Wednesdays for $2.99. I happen to be in the area on a Wed afternoon so I decided to pop in.  The interior reminds me of a child's playground, with three giant teddybears sitting along the stools facing the outside window. The walls are cheery and pink but there were sadly no patrons in side.  I placed my order and the server kindly gave me his opinion, letting me know that my modification would not make the drink as tasty as it should be. I went with his suggestions and waited patiently as he blended the fresh taro with the milk tea, and then strained it (I think) into my cup. Although it took much longer than I would have hoped, I was happy to see how creamy consistent the drink was throughout the entire cup.  At first sip... my eyes lit up and a grin spread across my face. The taro was lightly sweetened and very smooth. You can taste the ground up taro with every sip and the freshness of the root vegetable. For $2.99, I got a lot of love out of that drink and can't wait to go back for my next visit!"}
{"text":"The price is lower than other famous bubble tea chains but that's what you get, they don't taste as good as they should have. I've been to this store twice (the second time was to give it a second chance) but i was disappointed, again."}
{"text":"Lychee drinks are supposedly their specialties, tried the lychee watermelon smoothie, was really refreshing!"}
