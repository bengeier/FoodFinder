{"text":"I feel like the others are giving bad reviews without a real reason. I mean yes, this is not somewhere you go out for dinner, this is not a place you take clients for lunch BUUT it is an amazing spot to sneak away for your lunch hour, sit and read the paper and eat a sandwich and have a coffee.
I LOVE the turkey sandwiches, get one 2-3 times a week, yes I am lazy and don't pack lunches often. Its a basic sandwich, but the veg is fresh, the bread is soft and the meat is REAL roast chicken. 
The place is ALWAYS clean and cool. I never see uncleaned tables or anything of the like.
The service is SUPER nice and always friendly. The other day she gave me a cookie because she forgot to put onions on my sandwich (which were eventually put on anyways.) Like a poster before said, I can totally see them comping something because it was not to your liking. Sure, you may wait a few mins to get your meal but there's only 2 girls working and one sandwich station...soo a small wait it to be expected. You will wait longer at Subway during lunch.
Maybe you wouldn't get in your car and drive across the city to go here, but if you work in the area you can't beat this little place. love it."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee in the morning and a quick bite to eat at lunch. Friendly staff who make you feel like a regular customer. So nice to find an independent coffee shop especially a hidden gem like this one"}
{"text":"I want to love Coffee Couch, I do.  I work across the street so it is uber convenient.  However, I find their service lacking and their food is meh.  On my last visit I ordered the special of the day which was a Greek Chicken Pita and rice salad.  First off, the Greek Chicken Pita wasn't a pita...it was served on a tortilla.  It tasted fine but how weird is that....if you call something a pita it should be....a pita.  Crazy, I know!  The rice salad side dish was disgusting.  The rice was very hard and crunchy.  At the end of the meal (where I only ate one bite of the rice), I told the lady behind the counter that the rice salad was gross because the rice was crunchy.  She turned on her heel and disappeared.  The owner (I assume) came out & said \"The rice isn't crunchy, it's the onions and cucumbers.\" Um...no.  I do know the difference between rice and vegetables.  She continued to argue with me that their rice salad was amazing.  I said \"Fine...whatever.\"  She then decided to comp my meal.  Fine. I wasn't even looking for them to do that, I just wanted to let her know that it tasted bad in case she didn't know.  It was a totally weird experience."}
{"text":"Just found this spot yesterday and will certainly be back. The soup was fantastic, the atmosphere is great and the coffee was spectacular."}
{"text":"Back, back, BACK in the day, I used to work in this area and my coworkers and I would frequent The Coffee Couch. 

On a recent trip down memory lane, I decided to revisit my memories of this place. 

Their service is as good as always. They serve everything from breakfast to baked goods, specialty coffees, to herbal teas. 

I particularly LOVE their hot chocolate. 

Overall, a cute place, but one trip down memory lane was enough for me."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of independent coffee shops and The Coffee Couch is on my favourites list.

The food is great! Fresh! Homemade by Shelley. If you're a lover of those big ginger cookies... Shelley make them and they're the perfect snack in your day. 

If you're looking for a coffee shop with a comforatable place to sit and catch up with a friend or do a little homework, this is the place.

It's clean and tidy... always a good sign... and because it is, I have had a few client meetings here as well.

If your'e ever in the neighbourhood... make the effort to stop by for some great food & coffee!"}
{"text":"It's Sort of like diner personality meets Cafe. In an area dominated mostly by the industrial, The coffee couch is a nice local pick for your caffeine fix. 
There's a really solid community vibe to his place and I have no doubt that they have a very loyal following.
The owner is so pleasant that you feel good about spending your money there. That said, today I only stopped in for a tea and didn't even have the correct amount of change to pay and instead of doing a $3 debit transaction, she said not to worry, that she has a pay it forward amount. It looks like either her or one of her regulars created a fund for the express purpose of paying it forward and buying people coffee. She only asked that I do something nice for someone else.
It's a really sweet place that's stands out in character from any other chain coffee shops in the area."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM! I just walked in here as I needed a coffee really bad and there weren't any conventional coffee places nearby. I am blown away. The interview is beautiful and everything is home made including the soups! Yes please."}
{"text":"The Coffee Couch is lurking in a strip mall just off of Memorial Drive.  It is a cute little place in the corner with big windows, lots of light and really cute funky decor.

They serve breakfast bagels there, two eggs and toast combinations and they have a variety of pastries.You can have tea, hot chocolates and an assortment of coffee drinks and they prices are pretty reasonable.

The only thing I don't like is the fuzzy overthrow blankets that they have on some of the furniture, it looks more tacky than hip, and they could use a wash."}
{"text":"I was up in the NE hunting for an indie coffee shop... they don't appear to be as abundant up that way (or at least are harder to find since not many have reviewed them yet). My Yelp searches continued to turn up either a Starbucks, a Timmy's or a Second Cup. *sigh*. But I wasn't about to give in. A little more hunting turned up The Coffee Couch. Not in the NE anymore, but still north of Memorial. I read the couple of reviews from Sapna and Dinah and decided it sounded like a pretty good little spot.

I stopped in and grabbed a coffee and a slice of banana bread. \"Is this to stay or to go?\" asked the gal behind the counter. \"I'm not sure,\" I replied. \"Do you guys have wi-fi?\" She didn't think they did, but said other customers have picked up open networks in the area to use. So, I set up my laptop and, sure enough, found an open network. Except it was called The Coffee Couch. Methinks they have their own wifi. 

When I walked in, there was an old guy attempting to play a guitar by the front door. He had character, that's for sure, and I had my trusty earplugs. In they went as soon as I sat down. A few minutes later, one of the staff headed on over to him and asked if he could play a little more quietly. Nice touch ladies :).

I ended up spending the afternoon planted in one of their cute white wooden chairs. The shop itself was quiet, the coffee decent enough to drink black, and I really enjoyed the space. A little earlier that afternoon, I overheard one of the gals telling another customer that they only used real meat in their sandwiches, nothing processed. So, when my stomach was rumbling a couple of hours later, I knew just what to get. Turkey sandwich please! And sure enough, it was real turkey. They also piled on the veggies for me. I ordered another coffee with it. They told me just to pay when I was ready to leave. Well, when it was time to go, I wasn't charged for the second coffee. Free refills? Cool! Not sure how long that will last, but the gals only took over this shop a little over a month ago. I'd say they're off to a good start."}
{"text":"I haven't been to The Coffee Couch in years and don't know if new ownership is good or not, as I've always had a pleasant experience here.  They make a decent mocha, although the coffee flavor could be a bit stronger, and I had a lovely medium sized ginger cookie - not too hard, not too soft, which was only $1.  Seriously?!  That's rare.  There wasn't anyone in the cafe at the time and the cashier/server wasn't even going to make me pay right away.  I enjoyed the background music and particularly like excessive natural light, as the cafe is all windows on two walls.  I don't frequent this area of town very often, but would prefer to go here than a Starbucks or Tim Hortons."}
