{"text":"Wow went into Abe's for lunch with my wife. I was hungry and had seen the picture  of their Lion Burger on the website and had wanted to try it.... what took me so long. I struggled to get my my mouth around this juicy monstrostity. The bun was fresh and soft the buger mosit and fresh, no preformed patties here. the topping were crisp and fresh, burger heaven. but..... what really impressed me was the soup it was smokey corn chowder. simply put a bowl of goodness. There is a lost art to soup with so many place using prepakaged, this was made from scratch and so good I still want more."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a good burger and I got that and more. First off everything is fresh. My biggest problem with places like this is how when you order fries they have a bucket of salt on them. Abes only lightly salts their fries so you can actually taste the fry. My kids loved their burgers.  The buns are fresh and the ingredients are to. My wife and I had the Buffalo burgers and they were fantastic.  I have to eat gluten free and that's usually a nightmare because all gluten free buns are horrible (imo) but these were actually good. I had a talk with the chef about this. He told me he was happy to hear that and that they have had problems finding a gluten bun. Not surprising. He gave me the name of the bakery and said co-op sells them. The staff is friendly as well. My girls ordered dessert the vanilla bean Sunday which had homemade chocolate syrup. The other had the cheesecake which was not overly rich. All and all we will be back often."}
{"text":"Great little (aka, small) local place... 4 (maybe 5, tops) booths and some seating at the wood. My Hubs and I love local establishments and we stopped here for supper after a motorcycle ride when we were hungry after all the fresh air. Be prepared to order at the till and pick up at the service counter (kind of like Starbucks, sorry). 

Make yourself at home and wait just a few minutes for your freshly prepared burger and sides. The burger is 'flame broiled' and the french fries are hand cut, both are really good. A few draw backs, there is too much bun for the burger (but lots of toppings) and the gravy tastes straight out of the package.

The staff member who took our order was pleasant and kind, but we felt the prices were just a wee too high. $25.00 for 2 burgers, shared fries and warm tap water. And, yes, I DO understand the concept of 'overhead'.

I struggle whether to note this or not, but I will throw caution into the wind... There was a 'tip' function on the transaction machine although we ordered at the till and picked up our own food so I am not sure what this could possibly be for. Got a few 'stink eyes' from the staff behind the counter for not tipping in a 'fast food' style environment. Maybe if we were sitting at the counter and got a touch of service this would have been different. 

Trendy vibe, clean interior, good tunes, might be back one day."}
{"text":"Five visits in total to Abe's now, every one a great experience.  I've tried something new almost every time - Except today I opted for the Super Naan Grilled Cheese for my 2nd time because it was SOOO good.  Incredibly filling - I took some home today :)

My son had their Quebec Poutine - he had them add some bacon because he loves it - they were happy to oblige.  He enjoyed it immensely.

As other reviewers have said, it's a small place.  Packed it would seat maybe 25-30 people.  About 15-20 comfortably.  I personally find it best to go at off-peak times - even then the food is served FAST.

If you get a chance, chat-up Bernie - he's a really nice guy who really prides himself on serving up fresh, quality food VERY quickly at a fair price.  It's fast-casual, but not fast-food.  Everything on his menu is carefully selected to be able to prepare and serve to you in 5-10 minutes, which is amazing if you are pressed for time.

And I can't say enough good things about the sticky toffee pudding.  Seriously, try it.  It's simple and just ... perfect."}
{"text":"It took, no exaggeration, 54 minutes to be served. The entire restaurant was served before us. And the GF fryer was contaminated - the whole reason we came. 
The food was good, but not worth waiting almost an hour for."}
{"text":"Super place. Great little gem of a modern fast casual diner. Food is all prepared fresh with the open kitchen. Great burgers and home made fries. We had a Kale Power Salad that was very impressive and the Big Lion Burger which was a monster and incredibly delicious. We finished with their house sticky toffee pudding which was perfect. They used real date cake like you're supposed to. Incredible value, great spot, they'll need to expand soon if airdrie catches on and supports this unique room! 
Great job Abe's!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my husband to sit down and we have also ordered out a few times. We have tried the Burgers, Salads and Deep fried pickles and they were all soo delicious! Great friendly service, the food is cooked fresh and you don't have to wait long at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast this weekend and it was quite tasty. Good portion sizes, not huge but not skimpy either; we both felt satisfied when we were done. I had the clubhouse which had avocado on it and was really delicious! My husband had the more traditional breakfast and he also enjoyed his meal, we especially liked the hashbrowns. It's not a cheap breakfast, but it's pretty on par with what you'd pay for breakfast at most restaurants now. We intend to go back and we look forward to trying the lunch/dinner menu too."}
{"text":"Walked in the door and was greeted with a friendly hello. The place is clean and new with booths along one wall and a few tables in another corner. I ordered a Mushroom & Swiss melt burger with a side of fries and chipotle dipping sauce. The menu has mainly burgers but there are other options, wraps, soups, gluten free and vegetarian options. I was with three friends and we all enjoyed our meals immensely. The fries were on point, crispy and hot , but not too greasy. The burgers were fried fresh. After the meal we thanked Pat, the owner who also fried the burgers, and told him we would definitely be back. He told us to take some Halloween treats on our way out and thanked us for stopping in."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time yesterday to have brunch. We decided to try it out after reading the reviews on yelp. Walking in the atmosphere was good and it smelled great! We were promptly seated and service was good. We did notice the booth was dirty, the table had only a quick wipe down leaving food from prior service on the edges. The floor was dirty under the table with a couple napkins left there. Then we noticed the window sill and walls were dirty as well. I will note that we watched the kitchen staff cleaning the food prep area while we were there and when we were served the utensils, plates and glasses appeared clean.

I started with coffee and my wife wanted juice but changed her mind on the selections (boxed juice or bottles) so she stuck with water. The coffee was okay, I like it a bit stronger but just my taste. I ordered the egg scrambler with a side of toast and my wife had the traditional breakfast. There are no options for type of bread that we were offered. The orders came out fast and at first glance the portions seemed large. My dish consisted primarily of moderately warm grated hash browns, the egg was hard to find and the chorizo sausage was finely diced. For my personal taste the hash browns need to have a bit more time getting cooked to allow some browning/crisping. Not sure about the egg, the bits that I noticed were fine and I'm not expecting ten eggs in the dish but it seemed like a garnish. The toast could also use a bit more time as it wasn't very brown and the large amount of butter they put on didn't melt.

My wife's breakfast was fine, the eggs and bacon were cooked as ordered but the hash browns were just warmed not browned. Her toast was about the same.

I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"i got the classic poutine. i love salt and everything.. but the gravy was so over salted i was coughing and needed to keep drinking. which btw a bottle of water is $3... really? this place is just too overpriced for me, and the food was gross."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch shortly after they opened.  You order at the counter and sit down while your burger is being prepared.  Burgers were (obviously!) fresh, tasty and well prepared.  Also, big.  You will not leave this place hungry.  All in, a good experience and a good burger."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch at Abe's in Airdrie. Nice atmosphere with friendly, prompt service. My wife had the Skirt steak sandwich and I went with the Mudhead, both with caesar sides. She loved her meal. Mine was delicious. It's a heavy peppercorn gravy on the Mudhead, but I like that. The standard caesar salad is chipotle, a bit too much kick for me. Bill was just over $30. 
All in all, a very nice lunch. We'll be back."}
{"text":"When we are travelling, my husband and I always like to try and find somewhere different to eat besides the franchise restaurants.  In our search we found Abe's and decided to give it a try and very glad that we did.  My husband had the buffalo burger and I had the Kale salad.  Both were very good and you get your money's worth!  Neat diner atmosphere and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband heard about this place on cbc radio so we went to check it out and we're glad we did! They offer unique items such as the naan bread grilled cheese (which I tried) and really enjoyed. My husband had their award winning burger which he right was big - and he's a big eater. But I think my friends steak burger took the cake. 
For me,  the only thing I wild change is if they could make their in naan. A fluffy naan buttery naan would taste amazing!
Clean friendly and delicious. I would go back."}
{"text":"Been to Abe's many times and every time it has been excellent. Order at the front counter and find a seat. The soups are homemade and are outstanding. Everything I have tried was great. I don't eat fries so can't comment on them. The meals are served on real dishes and use real cutlery - unlike fast food joints. I met the owner (not Abe) and was impressed. It is named after William Aberhart school (forgot the rest of that story). Not a chain although he said he has a few Abe's around. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Coming here, I really didn't know what to expect. A diner in Airdrie, worth the drive from Calgary? Yes! We arrived for breakfast at 10:30, but all 4 of us ended ordering from the regular menu because there were so many delicious options! 

I ordered the grilled cheese on naan bread with chipolte Caesar salad and I was in heaven! My SO had the skirt steak sandwich and after his first bite, with his mouth full he said \"Oh my god this is so good!\".  A friend had the mud head burger, which looked like it might have had too much bread for the amount of meat. 

The service here is FAST!  You order at the counter, and we had our food in less than 10 minutes. Friendly staff who can recommend different dishes for you try if you're unsure.

And I see they do online ordering and deliveries for locals! Luck people of Airdrie! For me, I just look forward to the next time I'm in Calgary. This is the perfect stop either on the way home or on the way in from Edmonton."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  The cinnamon pancakes were to die for!  I want to go back for lunch now!  My partner had the standard breakfast with an extra egg. He said everything was excillent and his eggs were cooked perfect! He even had homemade jam for his toast.  The staff were very friendly and I like that you can watch the chef prepair your food.  You can sit at the counter or grab a booth. The place is small but not too small."}
{"text":"Really cute place in a strip mall full of chain options.  Service- kid friendly and the staff were awesome- prompt, likeable and attentive.  I had a regular burger which was yummy, lots of veg toppings that I enjoy (burgers over iron supplements preferred).  Fries were deliciously salty, huge portion sizes.  My kids really liked their popcorn chicken and burger meals- quite large servings for \"kid\" size which I will not complain about.  Hubs had the burger that he polished off quickly as well. 
Coming here for Mother's Day lunch after a Little League game was such a great experience- great service, huge serving sizes, tasty and satisfying diner fare and.....free slice of cheesecake for mom (yes, I shared with my family).  I am trying to drink more water with meals, so bottled beverage options (note one serving for $3ish) helped support that- but bottomless fountain pop (because I rarely drink pop) might have made this a 5 star destination when in Airdrie."}
{"text":"What a great experience. First off had a groupon deal that was wicked. The food was really good! I had the Bison Burger and the Kale Salad. So much flavour in the burger. The bun was also amazing. We talked to the owner who was quick to chat with us as my daughter. Even went as far as to give her a small Xmas tree that she was playing with. Have to check out the bathrooms!! Both of them! Seriously! We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"If Abe were working behind the counter and the place was adorned with authentic memorabilia from Abe's many adventures, I may give it a five after just one visit. While the food is excellent and well priced and the service is prompt and friendly, to me the place has a slight feel of a formulaic feel orchestrated by a downtown marketing company.

For that, Abe will have to work a bit harder for my Five, but he's well in his way with the Breakfast Club. A moderate portion at $7.75, it's nice not to be forced to spend $12 for breakfast and get more food than I can handle.  You can order take out from an app on your phone and free coffee on the weekends.

A modern day take on the traditional diner, Abe's is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicious fast food and friendly staff. Hidden gem in Airdrie!
The Naan Grilled Cheese is a great idea and delicious."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times for lunch now and I feel like this place needs more reviews. As I continue my quest for burger joints in this city, I'm glad I came across Abe's. I've tried the Big Lion, Tatanka, and Pulled BBQ Chicken burgers and I've enjoyed them all with the Pulled Chicken being my favorite, and Tatanka being my least favorite. I didn't think the Tatanka burger had too distinct of a flavor.

Beef patties were tender and I didn't think they were frozen. Buns were soft. Pulled Chicken was very tender and the bbq sauce wasn't too sweet. Their fries were hand-cut and enjoyable. If I remember correctly, they used kosher salt as well. I could be wrong about that. Poutine was solid too. Portions were pretty big too and for $12 for burger and fries, they're a good value.

This restaurant is solid. Not the best burgers and fries I've had but they were definitely the better ones in Calgary and Airdrie especially for $12. Abe's beats some of other burger joints in Calgary that are more expensive. A lot of newer burger joints are up to $15 now for burgers and fries so enjoy this price (and burger) while you still can."}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver, was excited to try this spot as recommended by a local. Sad to learn they only have booth and bar tables - not accessible to those in wheelchairs or other mobility aids."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time. Went with traditional eggs & bacon. 

Bacon was well done & very good. Eggs and hash browns on the other hand had a lot to be desired. Ordered eggs over medium and they were over easy at best - whites weren't even really cooked. Hash browns were undercooked and cold. 

Not very impressed. They won't stay in business long if this is the norm. Hopefully it was just a busy day for the cooks and they made a mistake on the order.

The waitress was also not very sympathetic and not very customer service oriented. It wasn't like we were asking for a new prime rib - we want our eggs cooked the way we asked and for the food to be hot when served."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"The Big Lion Burger\". One of the best burger have eaten for a long time. Juicy meat and great sauce.  Nice people."}
{"text":"Brunch was fantastic! We had the regular breakfast and the cinnamon pancakes. Eggs, bacon & home fries were very well cooked, flavorful and not greasy! The pancakes were WOW! I don't usually like sweet breakfast, but I could easy get addicted to those! They're so good, they don't even need syrup! 

My only suggestion would be for them to add hollandaise sauce to their menu (and maybe even eggs benny?). That would've been the icing on the cake for me :)

Service was great, pricing is fair, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place . Was so excited to try it. Went with my husband and kids . Overpriced food is an understatement . Hubby had burger and said it tasted worse than walmarts frozen burgers :/ I had turkey club yuck is all I can say will stick to Canadian brew house in future :)"}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise hidden back here, a delicious diner with a funky hipster vibe. When you walk in the smells from the grill hit you and you think \"Yes! This is gonna be good.\". Quick service, 5 booths, a coffee seating area and an old school counter to rest your elbows and mow down some hot tasty food! I think I may become a regular!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and the breakfast is really good.  Diner - both food and décor.  The kids love it here.  Big portions!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We were the only people there. The persons who took our order at the counter was pleasant and efficient. We ordered the chicken club and the naan grilled cheese, both with fries. We each got a drink, too (bottled). The sandwiches were decent, although the grilled cheese was a bit burnt on one side. The fries were super duper dark - like they'd been fresh the day before and then re-done like six times before they got to us. (They look so much better in my photo than in real life!) We only ate the few that looked ok. The cook (is he the owner?) seemed extremely displeased and was kind of rude. Overall, not at all worth the $26.25 we paid!  Cute decor, though."}
{"text":"We've been to Abe's 3 times now .
Twice for brunch - it was great and a salad  lunch .  It was all good on every level. Especially the service. !!
We'll  be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"We checked this out today for brunch\lunch.  You order at the counter from a large board and the food is delivered to your table.  The kids menu has all the usual suspects and are priced quite reasonably around $6 including a juice box.
   I decided on steak and eggs-over easy of course, and my other half went for a buffalo burger made from local meat. Everything came quickly and was fresh and hot.  My eggs were perfect and my steak tender.  I really enjoyed everything!  The Buffalo Burger was devoured and the upgrade to onion rings was worth it-crisp and delish.
  I really enjoyed this spot.  You can tell the food is prepared with care and the menu had many other items that caught my eye.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh and nicely plated food.  They have GF options and cute diner atmosphere!

The kale salad was delicious and kids meals very reasonable with lots of choices.

It's unfortunately tucked in the end of a strip center, but worth hunting for!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for the clubhouse, I don't know why I haven't stopped her before. Really sweet little retro diner tucked  in the newer section in Airdrie, this little diner totally delivers on both food and service. Staff are incredibly friendly the food is quick and well worth every penny. I didn't have a milkshake but I saw other peoples and I will definitely be going back for one. Best deep fried pickles I have ever had as well."}
