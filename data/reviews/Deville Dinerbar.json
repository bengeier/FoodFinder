{"text":"If you can't find something to eat at this restaurant then you can't eat anywhere... Menu items can seem a tad pricey for what is offered, but the food has never disappointed."}
{"text":"When the hype is better than the food! Burger is ok but for the price it should be way better. As we are deciding if we will have desert and coffee and more drinks the waiter says \" you do know that  your table as a limited time \"    Friend went to eat there were seated - no one brought them a menu or greeted ."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted a fun dinner out for our anniversary, so I looked up a few places on yelp. Deville Dinerbar looked like just what we were searching for. An unusual alternative to our normal dinners out. We made a reservation and when we arrived, we were seated right away. I love, love, love the decor in this restaurant. It's like a retro, yet modern cross between a casual diner and an upscale restaurant. We both ordered the blackened cajun salmon, which was delicious! The fish was perfectly cooked, with a nice spicy crisp on the outside. The rice and corn salsa were delicious, too. So the food was great, but I actually think my favorite part of the meal was the R-rated shake I got for dessert! I got the Old Rumple Eyes shake and my husband got one with devil's food cake (I can't remember what it was called). Both were delicious, but I think mine with the mint and Oreo was the best!! We loved our meal so much that we took our friend here when he visited and my husband tried the Profane Angel shake. He says that's his favorite shake at Deville Dinerbar. Our friend loved the shakes so much that he joked that from this point forward, he would never drink alcohol in non-milkshake form again. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. Food is good, but the reason I'm giving it a 2 star is because it is so so overpriced. Also our waiter was rude."}
{"text":"Such a nifty place! I believe they've captured the atmosphere of a polished and refined diner. Every experience I've had there was enjoyable.  Their drink menu is very satisfying for someone who finds the drinks just as important as the meals. A wide array of cocktails for all palates.   The food is centered around 'diner/American' style cooking, which works for me! Man, now I wanna go there.."}
{"text":"pretty good burger, friendly staff, the spiked mint oreo milkshake was really good (but also $12) kind of weiner-y atmosphere and couldn't tell id it was a joke or not"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service , delicious food and great fun drinks .. definitely a MUST GO AT LEAST ONCE in Montreal , you won't regret it"}
{"text":"$18 for a burger that was overcooked, bland, and left me feeling sick the rest of the day. Ambience is cool, service was good, but the food is terrible and overpriced."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for comfort food and other online reviews led us here.. We were so glad we found it. The burger I had 'cirque' with Brie and pear was absolutely amazing- probably the best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"Deville is fun, trendy and delicious. Do yourself a favor: sit at the bar and hope you get the company of Eyal. He makes great drinks, tells great stories and of course, he's easy on the eyes. Amanda and Vicki miss you already love!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice -Everyone was watching the soccer game so it was a decent afternoon lunch.  The menu was creative but the food was just okay.  I ordered the shroom burger and my friend ordered the turkey club. My shroom burger was good just very messy since it was not a patty.   Our waiter was really nice and explained the menu to us since it was our first time. The only thing I did not like was that I asked for a side of BBQ sauce and the manager told me it would be $2 extra."}
{"text":"Great spot! If you are around downtown Montreal and are looking for a good bite to eat with some great drink options, I would highly recommend! We can the mac&cheese won tons... comfort food to say the least! Next we tried the tuna tacos. I am not a fan of hard taco shells, but the wanton was a nice change with the seared tuna. The rest of the party had different versions of their burgers and greatly enjoyed. They have an extensive drink menu and a cute patio out on the back. Again, if you are looking for somewhere good in a very touristy area, I would make my way over here. We came for lunch left happy!"}
{"text":"Service, food, music and decor all made my birthday a great night out! Banana cream pie for desert was perfect (cookie crust to die for). I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Du \"comfort food\" chic! Ce resto bar branché offres des plats classique réconfortant \"pimper\" dans un décor resto année 50 actualiser.  Le décor est superbe, et c'est vraiment à coté du métro peel. Pour moi l'ambiance 5 à 7 jet set grosse musique boom boom ma déplus légèrement.. Je ne m'y attendais pas. Mais sa peux être super agréable entre collègues ou amis avec un bon verres. Ils offrent d'ailleurs des drinks dans des \"fish bowl\" ouioui!  Les plats sont quand même a un bon prix pour la grosseur mais les entrées sont dans les 15-19$. Plusieurs modifications comme, changer la frites pour un mac and cheese, ou bien une salade ect sont offert moyennant un certain montant.  Bref, super bonne bouffe, beau décor. Si on veux du comfort food fancy.. C'est la place!"}
{"text":"The menu at Deville Diner Bar is extensive but concise. You might think it's a bit of a contradiction to have something varied but focused, however, the kitchen is making each and every menu item for a reason. However random you might think the pairings and dishes are, I found the menu here extremely thought out and conscious. Respecting the tradition and concept of a \"diner\", these guys are playing off dishes that we've all grown up with. Deville Diner Bar takes those tastes that we are all used to, the flavours that we all love for sentimental value, updates them, buys them a Bluray player and an iPhone and welcomes them to 2012. They acknowledge any emotional attachments to classic dishes we have, takes you by the hand and leads you the way to show you what they've done with them."}
{"text":"Deville is a great combination between diner and cocktail bar, but also has really good food (foodie says). Their ribs are amazing, and so the burgers.  A 5 stars restaurant with a cool young touch that makes it one of my favourites.  Not to forget the very gentle service!"}
{"text":"One of the WORST restaurants of Montreal. First of all, we arrived and the waitress didn't tell us that they had a terrace in the back. So we sat in a very uncomfortable bench with the table super close to you so you can't even breathe. We ordered our drinks and food. Then I went to the bathroom and I saw the terrace on the back so I asked the waitress if we could seat outside. She didn't like it at all. We went outside and they never brought our drinks. After waiting for 15 minutes we told the waitress. Waited another 15 minutes. No drinks. We had to tell them 2 times more. Then finally we got our drinks. After 40 minutes they brought our food. Huge plates. Fries were terrible. Super thin and no flavour at all. Burger was mediocre. I ate half of it because it was extremely huge. Staff is rude, slow and food was pretty disgusting. I can eat a better burger at any other place for 8 bucks less."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés un Samedi vers 12h profitant du beau temps sur la terrasse à l'arrière du restaurant.  Decoration et atmosphere dynamique et colorée. Très propre et service aimable. Nous avons choisi le burger et le meatloaf avec un verre de vin pour accompagner le repas.  Bonne qualité dans l'ensemble et quantité raisonnable. Nous reviendrons!"}
{"text":"Go for lunch and it's bright and boisterious. Nighttime is crowded and busy. Very creative menu, fabulous cocktails. I love the chicken & waffles and milkshakes, and deep fried pickles!  I really love Deville Dinerbar - my opinion has changed since my first visit.    If you are two people - be aware of the seating - when I went with a friend, our reserved table was way in the back on the side, where wait staff squeeze by all the time.   I would go at non-peak times to enjoy it best. Their cocktails are AMAZING and yummy, and appetizers are a meal! Great portions, fun drinks and desserts, and a fun vibe and decor. Lunch is fantastic there."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant! The ambience was great, not too noisy. Service was quick and efficient. The food was surprisingly delicious. Would definitely recommend this restaurant for a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times the first 2 our food was great this time I had the french dip loved the bread it came on (was told baked fresh daily) and the beef was like butter, the only issue was the jus, super salty mind you it was 9:00pm it may not have been the case if I was having lunch. Great place wish it had more healthy options but then again I probably wouldn't like it as much."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world!!!! Love places that turn an already amazing meal into a god help me I must eat this forever!!!! Chicken and waffle with buttermilk sauce can't even explain...Philly cheesesteak spring roll, really...why didn't I think of it sooner. Salt and pepper calamari, can't go wrong with that... General Tao salad, was the best chicken general Tao in montreal I've find and last but not least ahi frickin tuna taco guys please please please have it!!!! You won't be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything at Deville is pretty good - the food, the drinks (which pack a punch), the service (I've been a few times and only one of my servers was a little cranky), and the ambiance is fun if you like restaurants with a slightly clubby vibe. It's reliable enough, and a good spot for parties. I just find the prices a little too high overall - the food is good, and the portions are very generous, but it's really, really easy to drop a lot more money at Deville than diner food (no matter how good or how filling) is really worth. (And some of their tables are kinda small - anything up to a four-top is fine, then things can get a little squishy.) That said, I keep going back because my first visit there was awesome - I had had a long day at work and hadn't eaten all day, was so hungry and tired I just wanted to go to bed, and the friendliest waiter took my order and came back with my cocktail and my Dinerbar Club sandwich in record time. On a day where all I needed was a really big meal and some fries and a cocktail, Deville delivered, big time."}
{"text":"Seville is creative with their menu BUT the food is bland and when ordering a salad you can not do dressing on the side when their tuna salad tastes like mayo and salt.. veal parm is huge but again bland. Prices are on higher end as well"}
{"text":"Had an awful experience the first time.. I ordered the chicken & \"spatsel\"... Barf! It looked like green brains.. And it tasted horrible. The chicken was flattened and deep fried and topped with butter.. Yukk!!! The waiter felt embarassed. My friends were disgusted. I didn't even eat it. How could they serve such an attrocity!? I don't know if they still had it on their menu. I hope not. I went back again for lunch and it was great! Explains the 4 star review."}
{"text":"I would like to give 4.5 for the overall rating, the 0.5 give to the creativity to this restaurant. The HUGH coconut onion rings, and the cocktails in fish bowl are amazing. We ordered the lamb pasta and the bad girl pasta( seafood pasta). It's unusual to see the lamb pasta, so we decided to give to try, the bad girl pasta is little bit spice and come with Large prawns and collapses. Always good for NEW people to try."}
{"text":"One Word : A M A Z I N G  went there 2wice already , the Taste & Quality of the Food is just breathtaking.  Also the knowledge about the Food of the Staff of the Diner is simply outstanding in a good way . Ask for Gabriel he is the Man"}
{"text":"Food was amazing !!! First restaurant we hit in Montreal .  guillaume was our server , he was great ! Always checked on us . I got the stroganoff and it was above and beyond delicious ! Check this spot out"}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Deville with family. Loved it - good food, generous portions, excellent service! Had classic diner decor with cool staff. Would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and you don't mind letting your belt out a notch, come to Deville Dinerbar and indulge yourself in creamy delicious milkshakes and burgers/sandwiches that you have to unhinge your jaw in order to fit them into your mouth. I recommend the Bandito Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwich with the Chips Ahoy Cookie Shake although the Inside-Out Burger is crazy good too!  If you are watching your weight, I heard they do have salads although I can't personally verify that fact or offer any sort of review based on personal experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! I went with a group of friends. Their drinks are really unique and their food was delirious. The salads are huge but worth it. It's a little on the pricy side but the portions and quality make it worth it. The ambiance of the place is awesome. It has the feel of a club mixed with a 50's diner. Our waiter was so accommodating and friendly. We all agree we would recommend this place to anyone who wants a fun night out in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Incredible food , much better than expected given the name \"diner\".  I guess diner means something different here , because my seared tuna was cooked to perfection , even the side salad of kale was an original creation.  BF had a chicken salad that was creative and delicious as well with candies waffle pieces in it"}
{"text":"Over priced and average food wouldn't recommend the French dip steak sandwich it's really heavy and kinda gross"}
{"text":"Went here after reading the yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. Great atmosphere, service, and food. Chic decor with warm mood lighting sets the stage for a welcoming dining experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Found a short and curly resting on the top if the meat of my sandwich.Glad I was pulling it apart. Otherwise overly trendy, over priced, water downed drinks, no beer selection.  Geared towards teenage girls.  When I pointed it out the waitress and manager were both apologetic and comped that meal. But we all know how it got there........."}
{"text":"The great dilemma, so many great options in Montreal so little time. Trying to avoid the chains, staying away from tourist traps we opted for this place based on proximity to our hotel and Yelp reviews. Very cool decor, fun playlist, super kind waitress. Drinks are unique, menu is eclectic   With some American classics, and a few creative twists.  An overall great experience, a single star deduction for being a bit pricey. Would definitely come back. Brought 2 kids who felt comfortable."}
{"text":"Il était temps qu'un resto se décide à offrir de quoi de nouveau, original et abordable, au centre-ville, pour faire changement des fast food ou autres places conventionnelles. Plaisirs Coupables, du chef Jean-François Plante, s'était essayé en 2011, mais en vain. Deville Dinnerbar se décrit comme un classique ''diner'' américain réinventé au gout du jour.  BOUFFE: Ce n'est pas tant la variété des choix au menu qui impressionne, mais plutôt la variété de ce qu'on retrouve dans les assiettes. Par exemple, l'accompagnement est différent d'un plat de Spécialités à un autre (frites, salade de choux, riz aux poivrons, pudding Yorkshire, gaufrettes, etc.). Signe qu'un effort est vraiment fait en cuisine, presque tout, incluant les sauces et desserts, est travaillé et conçu sur place et pour ça, un gros +1.  Les tacos au thon ahi (18$ pour 3) semblent être le choix le plus populaire des entrées et avec raison. Les tranches de thon qui fondent littéralement dans la bouche,  avec le mélange de chou et d'aïoli qui l'accompagnent, sous le croquant du taco frit commencent très bien le repas.  Autre choix populaires et délicieux, les Wontons mac n cheese (11.50$ pour 5) et la généreuse portion de Poulet frit au babeurre sur gaufre (14$).  Étant un GROS fan de chorizo et calmars, je n'ai malheureusement pas trouvé mon compte à Deville. Les Cigarillos au chorizo et fromage (12$ pour 3)  étaient secs un peu de l'intérieur, j'ai préféré de loin la salsa qui les accompagnaient. Malgré la bonne portion de Calmars frits (13$) et leur tendreté, j'ai moins trippé la panure ''sel et poivre'',  justement un peu trop salée à mon goût.  Après vous être bourré avec une bonne entrée, je vous conseille d'y aller avec un plat de leurs Spécialités, même si leurs gros burgers sont tentants.  À 19$, le Poulet rôti glacé à l'érable est l'une des meilleures assiettes rapport qualité/quantité/prix, en ville. Servi avec du riz crémeux aux poivrons, le demi-poulet est parfaitement cuit et bien juteux.  Classique anglais, la Côte de buf (12 ou 16oz) servie avec un pudding Yorkshire. Assez gras, mais excellent comme morceau de viande et surtout, bien assaisonné.  L es Côtes levées fumées à l'érable (23$) bien tendres sont accompagnées d'une tranche de pain de maïs et d'une très bonne salade de choux. Seul hic, la peau (silverskin) est laissée sur le dos des côtes levées, pas terrible.  Même les plus Gourmands seront rassasiés avec une des salades offertes. Et +1 pour la présentation. Petit détail pour la Salade Cambalache (21$, avec steak au chimichurri), c'est TRÈS difficile de couper des tranches de viandes dans un bol, peut-être fournir le couteau à steak!  Arrangez-vous pour garder de la place et essayer un de leurs desserts fait sur place, juste les photos devraient vous convaincre.  Plus grosse portion de gâteau que j'ai vu dans un restaurant, le Deville`s food cake (13$), un peu comme les entrées, se partage facilement à 4 personnes et sa description résume bien le tout; du chocolat, du chocolat et encore du chocolat.  Pains Perdu (11$), le froid de la crème glacée mélangé au chaud du sirop d'érable coulant sur les morceaux moelleux de pains dorés termine parfaitement le repas.  SERVICE/AMBIANCE : Très joli décor qui rappelle les vieux diners américains, jukebox inclus, je vous conseille aussi leur petite terrasse à l'étage, pour l'été. Même si on se trouve au cur du centre-ville, le service est courtois et efficace (merci Andrei et Véronique!).  COOL : - Menu complètement nouveau  par rapport à ce qu'on est habitué.             - Du site web du resto à ce qu'on retrouve dans les assiettes, on sent qu'un réel effort est fait pour rendre l'expérience agréable et nous inciter à y retourner.              - Aussi, un deal similaire à Firegrill est offert pour le stationnement intérieur - gratuit avec facture de 40$ et +.             - OpenTable  BOF: - Parce qu'il faut bien en trouvé un... je dirai de faire attention avec le bilinguisme à l'accueil. Je n'ai aucun problème à parler anglais et je comprends que la majorité des clients est composée d'anglophones ou de touristes, mais c'est dommage que l'hôtesse est obligée d'aller demander de l'aide au gérant pour me répondre, parce que j'ai le réflexe de commencer la convo en français            - Victime de leur succès, c'est devenu plus compliqué obtenir de la place un soir de week-end, utilisez OpenTable."}
{"text":"I always heard that this place is kind of funky, and when I tried it out I realized that funky is an understatement. Fried mac and cheese, philly spring rolls, original burgers and disco fries! Not to mention delicious deserts including homemade donuts!! You'll end up having a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Visited family in Longueuil and niece wanted to try the bad girl pasta dish.  Went there and find the place with very nice atmosphere.  We sat outside because it was a very nice evening.  Our server was Penny and she was great at first explaining the menu and drink specials.  After taking our order, she kinda disappeared.  Finally our dishes came out but two of the pasta dishes were missing pasta spoons.  But she soon disappeared again so the nice waiter next to our table was nice enough to give us the 2 spoons.  Food was excellent.  We did order beignet the same time with our dinner as they said it takes a while to make that.  Penny never came around the whole time to refill our teas, cokes.  The beignet came out way later after we all had finished our dinner.  When it finally came out, I was so surprised how big it was.  The beignet I picked had a wad of undercooked dough where the others were hollow.  Penny asked and I said there is a wad of undercooked dough in my beignet.  She said that's the way it is supposed to be.  I said it is not true beignet but she proceed to say she worked there 6 years and I'm the first to say that.  Well let's say I've eaten true beignet all my life and if one I ate has a wad of undone dough inside the beignet ball, that's not a true beignet period.  Probably won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by this spot because I've heard a lot about it. The decor and the ambiance was very enticing, it was really comfortable and it had a good vibe. I ordered the diner house club and it was sooooo good,  all the Ingredients went so well together and the sauce fit perfectly. On the table also was a steak frites from the lunch menu and it was also very good. It was juicy, the steak was cooked to perfection l, and the sauce, which tasted like Chipotle butter, was creative and delicious. The fries and the type of fries chosen combined perfectly with the dish. Finally we ordered the oreo crusted Nutella ice cream sandwich and it was simply f***** amazing.  Service was excellent and the waiters were very welcoming and friendly.   I will be certainly be paying another visit at this location."}
{"text":"I went there on a busy Friday night with friends. Deville has a very nice retro vibe with cozy U-shaped dinner seats on the first floor. It can get very busy but we had a reservation and so were seated right away.   We tried out their popular Ahi Tuna Tacos. They were as good as other reviewers made them out to be and I highly recommend getting a plate to share with friends. We also each got a burger. The burgers were on the pricey side for students but very filling and juicy. Be ready for a whole lot of meat. Special mention to the crunchy small fries that came with them."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service, Food - the essentials  Atmosphere: DeVille Dinerbar is a new edition to the flock of trendy cafes / dinners on Stanley street.  Unfortunately however, DeVille as a late comer - gives off the air of trying too hard, and borders on the pretentious.  It is themed to look like a trendy 60's dinner - but goes overboard with the usage of cliche and tried props like pink neon, semi-circular booths, and the menu printed on the walls (look for spelling mistakes!).  It could be a good place to have a business dinner though.   Service:  For a place that aspires to attract the young and hip as well as the old and established - DeVille does not do a very good job at grooming their waiters and waitresses very well in the art of service.  The staff, it seems, has been plundered from various other places, perhaps with the lure of a higher pay-cheque, and as such do not have any connection to the place.  Although the service is polite and pleasant, mistakes are not out of the question.  Food:  Perhaps, DeVille's fatal flaw.  The food is nothing to write home about, and at the prices listed, they are in no way shape or form enticing enough to come back to.  Since the menu, contains lots (lots) of items, in many categories, choosing the right meal frustratingly difficult. The fact that every dish has a pretentious (there's that word again) name, is also a drag.  Wants to be cool - but ends up trying too hard."}
{"text":"Super unique and quirky.  Definitely worth a visit.  I agree with other reviewers, a very original menu.  You'll want to check out the menu online.  Super friendly service."}
{"text":"I agree with verdict on this place. It inspires scepticism. The decor looks like Jack Astors on estrogen pills; cooperate and plastic.The clientele look like they are about to go see a Tiesto show... muscular dudes in various mall brand t-shirts and stuff like that.  In conjunction with the price my expectations were not very high.  But ignore all the superficial complaints I just had because the food here is awesome (and with big portions to boot!).   I had the Dinnerbar Club which had organic free run chicken, avocado and maple smoked bacon!  Amazing!  And despite the price seeming high, it isn't considering I was full after eating the fries and half the sandwich. That meant I had a delish half sandwich for my train ride back to Toronto (and it's very big half).  It's funny that a place that blares girly pop music (I was jamming out to Girls Just Want To Have Fun and Walking on Sunshine) has such intense portion sizes that would challenge the largest, beardiest dudes I know.  Awesome place."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family looking for some poutine and salads.  Was a treat.  The pappardelle with Lamb was delicious and the poutine was perfect, not too much cheese with a rich gravy.  kids loved the Mac n cheese.  Staff was friendly even to my vegan esque requests."}
{"text":"Je pense que tout le monde le dit : oui le Deville est bon, mais mon dieu la quantité de bouffe qu'ils mettent dans votre assiette. C'est impossible de manger tout ça.   Je suis une fille qui mange beaucoup d'habitude. J'adore manger. Je suis allée au Deville et j'ai commandé une salade. J'étais sûre que j'allais encore avoir faim, on parlait tout de même d'une salade contre une fille qui a l'habitude de manger toujours beaucoup: une entrée+un plat+une partie du repas de mon copain. Quand on m'a servi la salade, j'ai un peu paniqué. J'ai eu l'impression qu'on me la servait dans le saladier!  Salade : 1 - Yara : 0  Ceci dit, la salade que j'avais prise, salade du sud au poulet croustillant, était délicieuse. Le poulet était juteux à souhait, la vinaigrette au bourbon et à la poire était magnifique. C'était très bon. J'ai beaucoup aimé les croutons de gaufre sucrée, mais ils étaient très durs sous la dent et même pour la fourchette. Difficile de les saisir pour les manger avec la salade.  Si je donne 3 étoiles, c'est pour la quantité vraiment trop énorme de bouffe et aussi pour le prix. C'est un peu cher donné....!"}
{"text":"Super loud and trendy, but they still treated me and my kids well. Food is good but not transcendent."}
{"text":"Nothing I have ever had here wasn't excellent  The setting is very comfortable In the summer, you can even go on the terrace.   They make ribs a couple of different ways, they are all super  They have a special everyday, depending on the local ingredients.   They also have nice beignets for desserts.  I haven't tried it myself, but I heard the salmon is awesome."}
{"text":"The vibe is cool, place is packed, and the menu looks great. Food is average. R rated milkshakes are very good."}
{"text":"We ate here on our last night in Montreal. Probably best that we did on our last night bc I probably would have only eaten here it was that good.   I rely on yelp a lot while traveling. My bf is somewhat of a picky eater so we have to manage both our styles. The menu here seemed to meet both our likings so we gave it a shot. The drinks to start were delicious. So many different funky options! Then we ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari which was very tasty. This dish was a bit on the salty side, but when dipped in the sauce it really delicious.   From here I was really having a hard time deciding on what to get for dinner. There were so many options I wanted to try. I decided to go another appetizer and a salad. My boyfriend got the Drive In burger and commented that it was juicy & the well put together. I went with The Blue Cheese Iceberg salad and the Southern Fried Buttermilk Chicken Crispers. Both were really good but I ended up loving the salad a little bit more. The chicken dish was the perfect balance of sweet & salty. The salad was huge for one, but soooo good. Just the right amount of everything on it.   I would definitely not skip over this place if you're visiting Montreal. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A super fun restaurant! Their food was really good, and came with huge portions! This was a bit of a downside for people who don't generally eat a lot, since the prices were a bit high.  They had a large variety of food, which was nice since I went there a few times and never had to have the same thing twice if I didn't want to!  Decor is very much like a diner, which is super charming."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant. A bit loud. Fun menu with some great original items.  We had fried pickles for appetizer. Sounds gross but was amazing. Onion loaf was very good too. Mac and cheese appetizer was reaaaaaaally good. I had the beef ribs which were a little over done/dry but still pretty good. Others had the fat cat burger, with pulled beef. Said it was great. Fish and risotto (halibut, catch of the day) was really flavorful.   All in all was enjoyable. Was about 50$ per person tax and tip included, so not the cheapest in town, but I would definitely go back. Enough choices on the menu to satisfy everyone...burgers, salads, steaks, fish...  To top it off, original and yummy desert. Apple pie/ice cream sandwich.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Original burgers, original fries...heck...original MENU! Could I be any more enthusiastic? Deville, despite the price tag, really is the whole package. Great food, great portions, great ambiance and great decor. Even their drinks are fantastic - without it affecting the quality of the cuisine. We've all been to restaurants with great drinks & horrible food...   The burgers at Deville are juicy and their heaping portion of fries doesn't affect the fact that you'll still want more after. I even tasted some of that original Shepard's Pie they make - A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"The place looks like a fifties diner,  For a diner, it is quite pricey. The cocktails range from 12-16$!!! my you'd have to be drunk already to order that... we ordered a bottle of prosecco for 45$ split 3 ways and had about 3 flutes each, better deal, and the prosecco was quite good (crede bisol 18.90$ at the SAQ, I'm stocking up on that).  On to the food, we had: the ribs, which is made with root beer bbq sauce, the roast chicken, and for appetizer we had the ahi tuna tacos.  The tacos were quite good, nice flavour and texture of the seared but raw tuna and the crispy wonton serving as taco. except the sauce was a bit too sweet. The dish comes with 3 tacos and we each had one but if I ate this by myself the sweeteness would be too much after 3 tacos. But with just the taste of one tacos it was fine.  chicken was moist with a nice maple flavor, not too sweet. the pablano rice was bland, the aji amarillo sauce was nice, it's like a spicy mayo sauce with a kick. Overall, a B dish, not too delish... lol  The ribs were fall off the bones :) but they were too sweet!!! and frankly I wouldn't know there was root beer if you hadn't told me. It came with matchstick fries, which I found to be a little dry, but my friends liked it. The coleslaw was bland, it was barely creamy and it had dill. B plus, oh don't make me blush lol  I also ordered the milkshake with nutella and torched marshmallows. On the first sip it was really good, by the time I ate the marshmallow and drank half of it, I felt lethargic lol It became so sweet and rich. But it was soo amazing in the beginning... so A minus, don't make me cuss!!! lol"}
{"text":"Un endroit sympa bien que très bruyant. Les cotes levées d'Adam sont excellente, les plats copieux, la poutine disco remarquable et le service très bien également. Je recommande"}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to eat out at an American restaurant while on vacation. (I can get American food anytime at home.) my friend found Dinerbar through yelp and the reviews convinced me to give it a try.   The restaurant is super convenient to the Peel metro station. We arrived early (around 5:30) because we had not eaten since breakfast. We did not have reservations and the guy at the front said we could get a table but had to be out by 7:30. Perhaps this is when the uber-trendy hipsters arrive. No worries!   Our server Nicholas was incredibly friendly, attentive, and made solid recommendations. In fact all of the servers in our area were pleasant. The seating was a bit tight, but so what!   The food was outstanding. We started with the Philly Cheese Steak Spring Rolls. They were great. Perfectly executed with a side of what appeared to be cheeze whiz and balsamic. My friend tried to order the Shepherd's Pie but they were out that evening. So instead she ordered the lobster roll BLT. She reported it to be fantastic. I had the tempura fried lasagna. This is exactly what it sounds like but tastier. The portion was also huge. But not so big that we declined to look at the dessert menu. Nicholas suggested the Pan Perdu. I just had french toast for breakfast, but I am willing to follow suggestion. I am so glad I did. This was the best thing I ate that night.   Overall we were very impressed and would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Had a dinner here after meetings prior to a flight home and really enjoyed it. I had the El Sloppy Jose Burger which I don't see on their online menu..it was magic. Go here and have that if you can. Very nice meal."}
{"text":"Food there is amazing and the portions are very generous! I would def bring more friends there. I was just full with appetizers."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. Cool atmosphere and the food was excellent.  Not your typical diner.  I suggest you make reservation because it was very busy when we went.  Good place for kids ( we had six kids/teens with us), something which is not always obvious downtown.  I think the food was a hit with everyone, great beer, and the desert menu did most of in big time.  Excellent service!  It was a great pick to introduce our friends from Cleveland to the Montreal vibes (kid friendly vibes of course...)"}
{"text":"Had a courteous and prompt service from staff, my girlfriend and I ordered the maple glazed scallops as an entree( very tasty but a bit on the pricey side, almost 30$) As a main course we ordered the Neptune salad ( salad seemed mixed with a bad batch) tuna was properly cooked but couldn't really enjoy the rest of the salad due to a bitter taste coming from the salad. Then \"la pièce de resistance\" the hangar steak! No words can define the flavors and texture( from a beautifully grilled medium rare steak).    All in all, besides the prices, experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"The waiters on the uper floor were extremely rude. But when manager would pass by, they were all nice...? Food was amazing though! Not going back due to bad service."}
{"text":"Wow.  I've been wanting to come here for awhile now and was finally able to make it.  It was such a beautiful day out so we decided to sit on the back deck for dinner.  hen I always walk by Deville, I never knew they had a terrasse.  This is crucial!  We were actually the only ones out on the deck.  It was peaceful.  It is fully surrounded by a building, so it feels like you are in your own oasis.  You don't have the noise or the crowds on the street bothering you.  As I was walking through the interior of the restaurant, there was a lot of funky decor, but I will have to check it out on a less than perfect weather day.  They have quite a few cocktails, which were really good and original.  The menu is very extensive and offers a lot of variety.  Everything sounded really tasty so it was hard to narrow it down.  I ended up getting the Friday Night Pasta (even though it was only Wednesday night...).  It consisted of linguine with Tiger shrimp, scallops, lobster, and clams in the sauce.  Usually, when you see Tiger shrimps on the menu in a lets say risotto or pasta dish you don't expect much.  However, here you get many giant shrimps, plus the lots of the other seafood accompaniments.  Totally worth the price and it was very delicious.  The service was also attentive too (hard not be to be when you are the only one being waited on).    Definitely will be coming back for more and it has also become a go to spot for me in downtown."}
{"text":"The drink menu was great, the ambience was fun, and it seems like a good place to go with a group of fun-loving people.    We ordered some elaborate spiked milkshakes (kudos to the barmaid for arranging them with such finesse) and a couple of beers.  For the appetizer, we had the mac 'n cheese wontons with spicy marinara sauce on the side, and it was pretty good.  I ordered some ribs, which were delicious and came with a wonderful side of coleslaw.  I didn't care for the match-stick fries, which were soggy at best.  My dinner-mates enjoyed the salmon, chicken salad, and one of their many burgers.  The burger was impressive to look at and a challenge to eat, however, it was only passable since the patty itself was mediocre. Finally, the portion sizes are great, which is a bit of a shame for us because we had no room for dessert.  There's always another time, I suppose!  Overall, the food was presented very well and tasted fairly good.  I wasn't blown away, but I also wasn't disappointed.   A quick tip:  If you're a group of 6 or more, make reservations.  Unfortunately, they don't make reservations for smaller groups, so it pays to show up early.  It took our party of 4 about 30 minutes to be seated, but we were happy to drink a bit at the bar while we waited."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips Burger there. Aside from having a handful of grease , it wasn't very flavorful. The quality was like fast food. :("}
{"text":"Was here for poutine week and had the most decadent, delicious poutine ever! But also took this as an opportunity to peruse their regular menu and think the prices are a bit steep for burgers ($18+) and pasta ($20+) dinners. I guess you're paying for the atmosphere because it is quite sexy and fun inside with the dimmed pink/purple lights. Would be a good place for sexy dates and girls night out for cocktails."}
{"text":"Was very surprised. It was a triple threat...great food, service and price. I came here with my gfriend last week and we both loved it. I thought it was going to be extremely overpriced for what it was. My free range Maple Glaze chicken was excellent and my gfriend loved her burger. The Dranks were incredible and our waitress was very attentive. Would def make this place a regular hangout with my gfriends!"}
{"text":"Second time I'm coming here and like the first time, I loved it. Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, excellent staff!   If you eat here and you don't like it, then there's something wrong with you. Visit here and you won't regret it.   Highly recommended. A+"}
{"text":"The place was real clean , with a really cool vibe to it, great pink lighting and TVs everywhere. The service was good and quick. I can picture myself coming here with a group of friends for drinks and having a good time. There is a bar on the first floor. This time around though, my girlfriend and I only came here to eat, we ordered the philly cheesesteak spring rolls to start, which were pretty good. We both ordered burgers because their menu boasted how \"Good and natural\" their burger are, in my opinion they need to season their patties. The burgers tasted bland kind of like those cheap frozen burgers you buy at the supermarket, with no seasoning. The mashed potatoes were mediocre at best, tasted like they came from those powdered boxes, the french fries though were better than average, but nothing out of this world. My girlfriend had the black label burger and I had the Fat Cat burger, i just feel that with all the burger hype on their menu, they didn't hit the mark for me. I saw a few people order some good looking desserts, Maybe next time i will order something else and update my review. The burgers earn this place 3 stars at most in my opinion."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very kind, the environment was extremely modern, and the food was absolutely delicious! The disco poutine is a must have!!!"}
{"text":"My BF had lunch at this place this week and raved about this plate of spaghetti and meat balls he saw a waiter carrying, and he knew I would love it.  The atmosphere is American diner chic. They did well by not going overboard or being too kitschy. Some tables for two are a bit on the small side, especially by the window at street level. But the star is the menu, that presents a good variety of foods that all sound great. We started with the kopanisti dip and chips. The kopanisti was very creamy and had a nice kick to it. It came with the equivalent of a whole bag of chips, well seasoned and sprinkled with parmesan; they were fantastic. We also tried the caramelized red onion soup, which was nice but BF would have preferred a more interesting crouton on the soup, as this one was served with a slice of whole wheat bread under the cheese. But the broth was tasty, a bit on the sweet side as it contains porto. He was not wrong! Although I usually order something that seems less pedestrian when I eat out, and there were soooo many great sounding dishes on the menu, I knew I had to try the spag & meatballs. It was a good sized portion (ALL their plates are generous enough to feed you for at least 2 meals). The pasta was in the centre and covered with a great tasting sauce and served with a large dollop of ricotta on top. Three large meatballs surrounded the pasta, and each had parmesan shavings on top. The meatballs were creamy, the sauce brought me back to my childhood, and when I added a bit of ricotta to the mix, it was smooth and heavenly. My BF had the shnitzel and spaetzle. The batter was crisp, the and it was nice wit the cheese and hint of lemon, but there are so many other item on the menu that he would probably not order that one again. We chose to avoid dessert since we were both very full and already had two large bags of leftovers to bring home. The prices are on the high side, but if you don't eat the whole thing and bring home the rest for a complete second meal, it's not too bad. And I don't mind paying a bit more when the quality is there. And on that, this place really delivered the goods! I sooo look forward to going back."}
{"text":"We read about this in one of my tour books and our concierge also said it was good. They weren't kidding! My husband said it was one if the top burgers ever!!   The place was hopping so I was glad I had made a reservation through help beforehand. Saved us a lot of time.   I had a tuna salad which also was amazing and just what I wanted.   Service was good. Not too much or too little. So happy we went."}
{"text":"Shoestring fries were delicious and burger and sandwich portions large. We ate on the terrace and it was very pleasant out, but we were surrounded by apartment building so the view was of people's apartment windows. Very friendly staff. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!! From amazing food to huge portions to friendly staff this place is a winner. Wherever we go we seek out the best food thru Yelp and others. My husband said it was the best meatloaf he had ever eaten - even better than mine! Lol I had the chicken tender salad that was amazing and if I was by myself would've taken half of it home for lunch the next day. Definitely going back next time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"A very trendy restaurant with great food and service. Their menu is a fusion of so many different styles of food, which gives you lots of options to choose from. And their service has always been very good"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city! I always recommend Deville to out-of-towners as a fun and yummy restaurant, that's also located in the heart of Downtown Montreal. I love the \"diner\" feel of the whole restaurant, from the decor, music, and food. My favourites are the Ahi Tuna Salad and the Veggie Burger (their fries!!). Oh, and be sure to get their Won Ton Mac & Cheese as an appetizer... SO GOOD! They also have a wide variety of delicious drinks - I definitely recommend trying the Fishbowl Margarita! Super friendly service and an overall great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.  Fried chicken salad!!!  Can't go wrong with a healthy dose of fried chicken!! No wait salad,  I meant a healthy dose of salad....."}
{"text":"Food is great.  I was with a group of friends and loved everything we ordered.  I gave a 4 star, only the music was a bit too loud and we all had a hard time enjoying conversation."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch only on three occasions. The food is good. The service is good. I don't have anything bad to say about the restaurant, but there is nothing particularly special about it.  They do have a lovely terrace in the back that is great in the summer if you like to dine al fresco.   For a quick business lunch, it's a great spot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after walking around Montreal. They have a delicious burgers and food. I tried the fish sandwich and the fat cat. Both were delicious. I would recommend Delville dinner if your in the area."}
{"text":"Atmosphere  So here is the story, my close friend is addicted to this restaurant called Reubens on Saint Catherine street and the owner opened this new restaurant called Deville on Stanley street. This is when his new addiction started. If you couldn't reach this friend of mine, it was a safe bet to assume he was at one of these 2 places. He literally eats at Reubens or Deville once every day. I ended up going to Deville last night for the first time and was impressed. So as you walk in this Montreal restaurant you become surrounded with a great fancy decor with bright purple lights coming out of different parts of the room. The atmosphere that I got from Deville gets a well deserved 4 stars.   Drinks & Food  So it didn't take long before I spot my friends at the bar on this Tuesday night. Deville Dinerbar was pretty empty with the exception of maybe half a dozen clients still seated. I was pretty surprised when I saw my friend's drink, it looked like a margarita with a flipped beer inside of it. It was pretty confusing a first and even after tasting his ''Megarita'' I wasn't sure about my feelings towards it. I loved the big glass it came in so I had the amazing idea of ordering a 4 oz Mojito to be put in that exact same format. It was really good and I also had the pleasure to respond to a couple of amused looks. Half way through my drink, I felt like having a little snack so I ordered the Mac and Cheese which I heard wonderful things about. The best way I could describe it would be by telling you it's like ordering nachos but replacing the chips with pasta. It was one of the best and most original Mac and Cheese I had ever encountered. I am giving Deville Dinerbar 4 stars for its Drinks & Food.  Service  The service we got at the bar was pretty amazing but that's probably because my friend knows the entire staff. I was mainly really impressed with the service of the bartender because she was fast, good and also very fun to chat with. If you ever decide to go at Deville Dinerbar (which I do recommend) and end up being seated at the bar, I really hope you get to meet Cloe. We even had a couple of waiters coming to chat with us once in a while and we ended up staying till they were about to close for the night. My friends and I had a blast that evening and this is why I am giving the service of Deville 4 stars.  Location  The location of Deville is pretty good. It is situated on Stanley Street which is halfway between Guy Concordia metro and Peel metro. For the location of this Montreal restaurant, I would give 4 stars.     The total amount of stars I would allocate to Deville in general would be 4 stars."}
{"text":"Dear fellow Yelpers,   This is probably one of the best restaurant that Montreal can offer in terms of food proportion, originality and service. Actually I don't haveany negatives except that it can be very busy and hectic. However, I'm sure their awesome managers will be able to satisfy any of your inconvenient or arisen problem. They also have a terrace, which is definitely a major plus!  Honestly, one of the few spots which I can allow myself to give 5 stars. Moreover, in terms of price, Deville is not as expensive as one ought to believe. For around, 25$ you will most likely enjoy their grandiose meal and experience in this hip restaurant.  One can also choose to download their app and choose their own music from a selected playlist? How amazing is that ... Although , the lineup for songs can be pretty intense especially during the summer.  As for the food, fair warning , PORTIONS ARE GIGANTESQUE. I've tried both their lunches and dinners, both are excellent!! During lunch hours , you can choose a meal from a selected country of the week. This allows you to discover other meals from deville that is inside their regular menu , I definitely recommend to try it. As for the selections inside their menu, I can't talk for everyone of them, but for the ones I've taken , I've never been disappointed. Their burger is excellent, just dry and seasoned enough to give you a melting burger taste inside your mouth within 5 seconds. Their general Tao salad is an excellent low carb choice that will fill anybody's tummy. Lastly, my favourite, the dinner bar club is HUGEEE and it's taste and unique and will probably prompt you to book another date with this restaurant, I, myself cannot describe how amazing it was ... Thus , I highly recommend for Yelpers to try it :) A vast selection of their meals come with fries. Personally, fries are one of my favourite food, and I can say that deville does not disappoint in that area-- miniature but extremely tasty.  Any who, if you are still reading this, I can argue that deville is a special amazing restaurant that Montreal has to offer and usually one will be delighted to be part of such an amazing experience."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but definitely worth it!! The food is really good and all the meals have a creative spin on them! The drink menu is really great too, it's a great spot to go for cocktails. Perfect spot for after work gatherings or a place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The food was OK, reasonably priced for what it is...menu is very extensive. Poutine was too salty, so they took it off our bill. Good service"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, friendly staff and good dining options. Prices are a little high for what your getting but the ambience is nice. I'm sure I will go back one day."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the food was fantastic. Leave room for the coconut cream pie!!!"}
{"text":"The decor may scare you off with the amount of pink and black everywhere but resist the urge to walk away. The Deville Dinerbar is a great homage to classic diner dishes and a fantastic restaurant.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drinks menu.   The edamame was a nice starter and well-seasoned.  The Shephard's pot pie was wonderfully cooked with braised short-ribs, green peas, corn, and mashed potatoes topped with a delectable flaky pastry crust. Knowing how good the pastry crust was, the Apple Pie Ice Cream Sandwich did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and I love it. One of my fav in Montreal. Great choice of burgers and sandwiches. Tasty and creative. A bit expansive but worth the price."}
{"text":"We were looking for a bite before the hockey game and ended up finding a parking spot in front of Deville Dinerbar...its purple lights beckoned so we decided to give it a try.   The decor is cool - like a very modern retro diner - very sleek.   We mentioned to the hostess that we were going to the game and would be a little rushed to eat and she assured us there would be no problem. In fact, our waitress was already waiting at our table upstairs with a menu and a smile and assured us we would be fed and out in plenty of time.   The menu was pretty extensive and I would have loved to have more time to browse every interesting but delicious-sounding offering but time constraints being what they were I chose the first two dishes that caught my eye.   We started with the chorizio and cheese cigarillos - fried tortillas filled with chorizo and cheese - which were greasy but delicious. The tomato-mint dipping sauce didn't really add much to the dish however. I followed up with the brasa sandwich -  basically chicken, ham, cheese and pineapple on a country roll. It was a very geneours sandwich served wih an equally generous portion of matchstick fries and all of was good to the last bite!   Our service was impeccable - our waitress was quick, efficient and very sensitive to our time constraints. She brought dipping sauces for the fries and extra napkins without being asked and was helpful without being  envasive.   It was on the pricier side with 1 appetizer and 2 sandwiches and 2 beers totaling 70$ before tip. But I did enjoy every generous bite!"}
{"text":"We came as a visiting team / mob of 24 on a Saturday evening, and they were able to accommodate us comfortably on their outdoor patio.  As many have indicated, the food here is basically elevated twists on some modern classic dishes.  Our group sampled a wide variety of their appetizers and entrees, and no one left disappointed.  Some of the \"hits\" I recall: Ahi Tuna Taco, Fried Pickle chips, and the Seafood Paella.  The service was also on point as our waiter took care of us nicely.  Definitely a good dining option when in Montreal - and again thanks to the venue for hosting us on rather short notice!"}
{"text":"I've never had a good mushroom veggie burger, usually its one huge piece of sogginess which comes up relatively bland. BUT the veggie burger here, known as the rio grande shroom burger, is out of this world. Its made of three different types of chopped up mushroom (cooked to perfection) mixed with cheese married to a whole bunch of other wonderfully delicious components. Oh and it comes with matchstick fries ! Drooool !  The only negative is that the food is a little expensive, the burger is about 18.5 $ which is a little pricey but worth the splurge if you've been craving/hunting for a good veggie burger!"}
{"text":"Like a bimbo - Deville is all looks and no class.  Reservations are taken merely as suggestions and you can expect an hour wait-time for a spot in a gaudy and inconsiderate atmosphere. Thank you for that disappointing build-up with a climatic experience of food poisoning.  In the future, please adhere to the universal policy that a reservation will you get you a spot in a timely fashion. And you know, shut down. Thanks."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. Delicious ahi tuna tacos and cocktails. Trendy atmosphere, perfect for a date night or girls night out. Their cocktails are also delicious ! My favorites on the menu are the ahi tuna tacos, the ahi tuna salad and their paella (which is surprisingly delicious. Huge shrimp and scallops). I've also tried their lamb pasta and burgers, which was acceptable but nothing to write home about. Their portions are huge, so its great for sharing, or to take home for later.  Price point is relatively higher, but given the atmosphere and portions, it is pretty reasonable. expect to pay around $40 for main & appetizer to share."}
{"text":"With a creative and unique menu in a fun and distinct thematic ambiance, I was thoroughly impressed! Service was good, especially considering it was near to closing when we arrived. Food taste and presentation was fantastic, and drinks were equally as good. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a unique experience."}
{"text":"Deville is a place that never disappoints. Been coming here a lot over a few years and their consistency and service are always at high.  The place is clean and well managed; the staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Now for the food...  Their specials always carry a well thought surprise; though a bit more expensive, one should ask for the specials and try them.   As for the menu; the burgers, meats, fish and pastas are exceptional. Nothing I've ordered so far was a bad choice and will always come for more.  This is a must visit in my book and highly recommended.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"After a long drive from the states to Montreal we looked for a place near our hotel that was not too expensive and offered food for picky kids. We were surprised at the quality and portions of our meals. The lamb shanks were delicious and the kids loved the spaghetti and (spicy) meatballs. Even the kids meal burger and fries was full of flavor. Just wished we had ordered less and split dishes as each plate was plenty for two. Didn't have room for desert but hope to go back and try their shakes."}
{"text":"Excellent en tout point.  Le menu éclectique et raffiné saura vous plaire.  Des combinaisons de saveurs inédites qui vous transporte un peu partout sur la planète.  L'endroit est branché mais sans prétention. Un must au centre ville.  En prime, vous pourrez peut-être y faire des rencontres intéressantes."}
{"text":"Cocktails here are great! Food is kinda heavy, so I would recommend splitting if you plan to go out afterwards"}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars for several reasons.  Great atmosphere, attentive, knowledgable and friendly staff, and finally the best fish tacos I've ever had! Although it does have a dinner-esque look, it is more like an upscale dinner.  Very interesting and inventive menu.  Lot's of things looked really good. Good cocktails, although those are slightly pricey.  In the end, we ordered a couple of cocktails, the edemame appetizer, the ahi tuna tacos, and the meatloaf.  All were excellent, and interesting takes each.  I will definitely be craving those tacos, and want to return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Deville is an amazing place - a hidden gem in Montreal. The decor is beautiful, the food is really good and fun to eat and they have cool drinks. What more could you ask !   The appetizers are very good. You can literally pick a couple and share them as a meal with friends. Their burgers are also delicious. The Deville fish bowl drinks are awesome. If you want something without alcohol go with their milkshake, they are huge and have full cookies and marshmallows inside !!  If you really want to go all out don't forget to order the donuts at the same time as your meal. (They prepare them on the spot so it takes about 30mins)  All in all, i strongly suggest Deville. I've probably been around 10 times in the last couple years and we always had a blast with friends !!"}
{"text":"Ok can we talk about decadence! It's one of the fun decent places in the downtown core. Decor is funky, food is fun and the servers are great! All the menu choices are over the top so consider it your cheat meal:) my all time favorites are the mac & cheese won tons (yummm!) and the beignets (order before the end of your meal & share as it takes time to make) or the pain perdu (OMG!)."}
{"text":"This is a trendy looking diner. The food is mediocre and overpriced. The bad girl pasta was $35, and the mini lobster rolls (very small portion and the meat was dry) were $22."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent decor. The food and drinks are on the high end whilst still being very affordable ($$ is fair - with a bottle of wine, beers, and mains we had $40/pp for 4 people).  Tuna ahi taco appetizers that I had as a semi main are WONDERFUL. The waiter recommended a Pinot Grigio wine which was excellent, and all the dishes that we have tried were excellent: - chicken schintzel - meat loaf - macaroni and cheese - burger (not sure which one - there is a full page of burgers to pick from)  Overall a solid 4-5 star place - highly recommend.   It is somewhat noisy, but not so much that you can't have a conversation - but expect diner level noise, not high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, unique menu items and amazing drinks made by the one and only Eyal. A truly awesome upscale diner experience."}
{"text":"Le Deville est une très bonne place où il fait bon d'aller manger!!  Mais pour commencer il faut penser à réserver sinon on est bon pour attendre!! Je me suis installé au comptoir, et j'ai pu voir les cuisines d'où j'etais! Le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est que c'est des vrais pros!! Ils travaillent avec des gants, sont propres, soignent les assiettes pour qu'elles soient présentables... La nourriture maintenant: j'ai choisit le burger à l'envers, vraiment vraiment très bon! Les frites aussi, fines, pas trop grasse! Les proportions sont corrects pour un burger! J'ai pris un dessert (dont je me rappel plus du nom exact) et vraiment bon mais très copieux, je n'ai pas réussi à finir c'est pour dire!! Par contre le service au comptoir était pas terrible, j'ai beaucoup attendu pour avoir de l'eau à chaque fois, et ils étaient pas très agréables!  Le prix est un peu cher, mais quand on voit le serieux de la cuisine et la qualité de la nourriture c'est compréhensible!"}
{"text":"When I first read \"Dinerbar\" I thought to myself \"meh\". Walked in to a smiling face at the door and was sat immediately. First look at the menu and I was impressed. Great choice of food and drink without breaking the wallet completely. It's not cheap but isn't expensive either. I had the Paella and it was some of the best food I've had. Specials everyday of the week with Monday being cheapest. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has gotten so many thumbs dowwwwn! While I didn't even know it existed until yesterday, I was surprised to discover a bright and shiny pimped out modern diner. Sounds tacky, but it was actually pretty swank with a classy bar, funky bar stools and booths, and a top floor area with loads of seating for couples or small groups. This place is apparently known for its cocktails and the bartender took my indecisiveness (I was merely just feeling brain dead) as a cue to whip me up a tequila infused concoction that was tasty - and tart.   The menu is slick with loads of different kinds of starters, salads, pasta dishes and burgers to choose from. I had some calamari to go with my boozy drink, while my friends ordered a bunch of dishes that all looked yummy and delicious. They seemed happy...but, I never know if it's because they are tipsy or they just generally love life no matter where they are. I'm going with A and B. Our server was also very friendly and courteous. So, I have to ask myself - Why all the haters hating on Deville Dinerbar? I really don't know...all I know is, don't hate - appreciate!"}
{"text":"We came in and they sat us it took forever to get menus and order... food was ok nothing great its cool for some change but ive had better food and better service"}
{"text":"Food: Exceptional burgers and fries.  Beef was juicy and moist. Buns were lightly toasted to perfection.  Service: Extremely busy place. Reservations are definitely recommended. Servers are courteous.  Decor:  Dark with neon lights. Almost feels like a lounge. Very uniquely decorated.  Would I return: Yes. Reservation made!"}
{"text":"What a great place in all aspects! The atmosphere is energetic, but not so much as to be a distraction.    Service was excellent throughout, from the moment we arrived until we bid a good night. Penny was our primary server and she met our every need, even anticipating a few. The staff works well as a team and contribute a great deal to the successful operation of Deville.  The front room has the main bar and some tables. The back of the restaurant is up a half flight of stairs.  The kitchen is half a flight down and you can get a good view of the action as you go to your table.  The decor is delightful - modern diner elements are tastefully merged into a comfortable and vibrant atmosphere.   The menu is based on traditional diner comfort food, but often with a modern touch.  Being in Montreal, we had to try the Disco Poutine. The fries were hot, thin, and crispy and the Disco gravy paired very well for this variation.   I had a burger with cheese and bacon. The sandwich was of considerable size and I had to resort to fork and knife halfway through.   My friend had the hanger steak special and it was majestically presented on a wood butcher block with an impressive mashed potato side.  He was quite impressed with the taste and quality of the steak.  As a treat, I ordered a strawberry shake (or frappe as we call it in New England). Very well-made and flavorful. It was presented in a traditional style ice cream fountain glass complete with a metal frame handle.   Thank you, Penny & staff, for a delightful evening."}
{"text":"I love this place with a capital L!!! I wished the tables were a bit bigger. When the restaurant is full it can feel like you are lunching  /dinning with everyone. This time I ordered the mac and cheese won tons. Unfortunately I wasn't a fan.  l previously enjoyed their regular mac n cheese , but the wontons not so much. As a main I had the bad girl pasta.... It was a bit pricey but it was soooooo good!  I think they should add lobster to it tho!  This is one of the restaurants that I can go to and know ill recieve a good service, and my food will be hot n tasty! Its a bit expensive, but then again it is situated downtown!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I just left and I give it a solid 4. It is so fun, staff are wonderful. So our food was pretty good. We both thought the blue cheese wedge salad was amazing. I had the bad girl pasta which I went for specifically and I give it a pretty good 4 - the flavor was good, Shrimp and mussels were great - I had hoped the scallops were a little more charred but overall a solid 4. Husband had inside out burger and it was good but he thought it was salty - I did not. He gave his burger a 3.5. I would go back for tons more tries - he said he is unsure if he needs to revisit. A solid 4 I say.."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorite spots in Montreal. It might be a bit overpriced, but seriously, practically everything in the menu is delicious. Excellent for any occasion."}
{"text":"First meal in Montreal. Interesting decor, maple-glazed chicken pretty good. My friends burger n fries looked even better. Not the first place I'd go back to but definitely try if you have time."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place: decoration, vibe, service, burgers are some of the best i had & milkshakes are so tasty, presentation ! fun for a small group outing   Very original"}
{"text":"Good place to go before a hockey game, space is a bit right though, we were five big guys and they thought they were doing us a favor by giving us a tiny booth, felt like I was playing footsies with everyone.    Had ahi tuna fish tacos, with a hard shell that can't hold anything together...they should definitely change to soft tacos, like every other place in the works.  Burger was just ok..."}
{"text":"Great upscale place to go with friends or on your own. They have different drink special every night and bar staff is always friendly and coming up with a great suggestion on what to get based on your tastes. Cool spot to hit up before a night out downtown !"}
{"text":"Great American diner, great lively atmosphere in downtown Montreal. My favorite was their milkshakes, not too sweet, good combination of ice cream and milk. Great portions, very satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, i had a special plate which is not on the menu, octopus with chorizo, arugula, yellow and purple patatos very good. My friends had a burger and samdwiches and they were delicious. Their fries are realllyy good and the fish bowls very different than other bars ! Would go back for sure !"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!!  Everything from the decor, to the menus, and the ridiculously extravagant food and drinks ---- this place screams girly birthday dinner!  Probably would skip it for an anniversary dinner...unless you're okay with a food baby for post-dinner celebratory activities...ha! ;)  Bathrooms are beautiful.  It's definitely not cheap, but I'd say the food was well worth the price.  Pulled pork sloppy joe on MAN I still have wet dreams about you...  Sub your fries for their Disco poutine fries, couldn't figure out how they were so good because they just came out looking like regular fries, but YUM!  We got there around 5:30 on a Thursday night with no reservation and were seated immediately, but told we had to leave before 7:30 haha.   Portions are GARGANTUAN (isn't that word fun??) and after eating at 6pm, falling into an almost permanent food coma, I wasn't hungry until the next day again around 2pm haha.  We got a sangria fishbowl, which in concept is awesome, and it looked really good, was really just a giant glass of juice.  Didn't taste like alcohol and didn't get even slightly tipsy just sharing it with one other person.  Not worth $24!!  Adult milkshakes looked awesome, but with portions that huge, who has room for milkshakes?!  Would love to come back and just have one in outdoor seating in the summer."}
{"text":"Stopped there for dinner before a movie on \"cheap night\".    Ambiance:   Was generally impressed with the decor which was dark, but tasteful.  The music was the right volume so it could be heard and yet not so loud that you couldn't have a relaxed conversation.  Service:  Excellent.  No mistakes in the order, waiter checked in, refilled glasses and did a nice job of explaining the specials and providing recommendations that were spot on.    Food:    I had the mini-lobster rolls, which were a bit on the expensive side, and I have to admit, the lobster was a bit, FLAT... i mean, it was good, just not amazing.    The Ahi tuna tacos and wasabi mayo were delicious and fresh.  Nicely seared piece of tuna and a nice fried tortilla shell.  The fried pickles were the star though, the spicy ketchup and maple butter sauces were a perfect match.  I had the chop chop salad, which was good, but just too big.  It was clearly more something that could be shared while getting a main each.    The burger my dinner companion had looked spectacular and the shoestring fries were perfect.  For Dessert, the Pain Perdu was amazing but the Lemon Meringue pie was just not very good, I mean, maybe it was me.  It looked amazing, but i just didn't like it.    Generally a good meal.  I was  hesitating between a solid 3 or a 4. but what sealed the deal for me was when the waiter noticed I didn't touch the Lemon Meringue pie, he immediately took it off the bill.  He insisted.  Haven't had such service in Montreal in a long time.  As a rule, restaurant service in this city is terrible and this place is certainly an exception."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, nice atmosphere.  Burgers are a joke though as they are just to big to even attempt to pick up and eat.    RESERVATIONS RECOMMENDED - but we show up very early and never need to make them but when we leave the place is always full  Great place to stop into before a Habs game."}
{"text":"The DinerBar is the prettiest diner you may ever see.  Too bad their food doesn't match!  I would never eat here again!    This establishment is expensive for no apparent reason.  I ordered the fish on a bun and there was more bun and batter than fish.  The french fries were the skinniest I'd ever seen & full of salt.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  If you're a vegan or a vegetarian, this is NOT an establishment for you.  There is literally NOTHING on the menu for us to eat."}
{"text":"Off the hook!  Fun atmosphere with great menu and killer drink choices.  Had meatloaf... with bacon woven thru it...yes, I said bacon!  Crazy deserts....donuts!     Not your normal diner fare.  Well worth a visit when in Montreal."}
{"text":"You know.. It amazes me how a night can be going so well and how you can rate your experience very highly in your head until in one split second the manager ruins it all for you.  Unfortunately that was our experience here.  I had plans to come to Deville with a few girlfriends last week and was so excited to try it out because the reviews looked great.  We were seated, and right away you could feel a funky vibe from the diner with bright purple lights and cool oldschool booths lining the space. After looking at the menus, we were told that the mango mojitos were the special of the day so we went with those and they were pretty good.  We then ordered our mains (I had the Adam's Ribs) and received our food in under 20 minutes. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, the cornbread sweet but well made, and the coleslaw was good too (not too smothered in mayo). I wasn't a fan of the matchstick fries, but that's just me.  Others at my table also really enjoyed their food and overall experience.  Once we finished dinner, we asked to see a dessert menu and were approached maybe 5 times by our server asking if we had made a decision. This was a little bit annoying because he was hovering but even then, I wasn't mentally taking any stars away from my review. We ordered the apple pie ice cream sandwich to share which was also very very well made.  By that point, we had been at the diner for about two hours to 2.5 hours and had been chatting as most people do (9:30pm on a Thursday). We paid around that time also and proceeded to continue our conversation. Around 10, the manager came to our table pretty much kicking us out saying that she had reserved our table for another couple who had been waiting over 35 minutes for us to leave, and that she could seat us in a corner (our booth had access to the TV) because they wanted to watch the game, or we could just leave.  Now you can imagine our disdain....no one had said anything to us about our table being reserved. We were paying customers who didn't really overstay their welcome in terms of going out for dinner, drinks, and dessert. And you can't just kick people out because they've paid their bill and now someone else wants our particular table (which was nothing special by the way).  So, as you can imagine, the three of us left with a very bad taste in our mouths, and although I was really excited to bring other friends and family to try out the food here, it's safe to say that I will definitely not be back. There are tons of delicious options in Montreal with excellent service as I've mentioned before in another review or two. Bad service or being spoken to as we were for no reason is really not acceptable in a city where competitors are a dime a dozen.  But to those of you reading to see if the food is good, it is. The service was quick and the decor is well done. Before the manager came over, I was planning on a 4 star review, but two stars removed for this unneccesary action on her part........"}
{"text":"Fun & modern decoration.  Mac n cheese is so rich of cheese and with a little creamy mash potato in it. Classic lunch set is pretty worth the price since you got to taste 3 kinds of meat (pork tinder lion, beef and sausage), salad, soup and dessert included!  Serve pretty fast, everything hot and fresh. Would definitely visit again for lunch or maybe dinner to try the special drinks."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Try the super Hanger Steak! The  Spaghetti with Meatballs and Burger Deville are equally delicious. Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"The look of this restaurant is super fun, think 1950s dinner and \"On Wednesdays we wear pink\" vibes. It's the perfect destination for a date night or girls night out. The homemade donuts are to die for and the mac and cheese wontons are unreal. However, the one item I catch myself day dreaming about is the mini hot dogs...they are SO good!!! Ive tried all their salads and my favourite is the Chop Chop salad. Lastly, they have a cute terrace/courtyard during the summer-very nice!"}
{"text":"Well it was nice to dine out in the new year day but we ended up food poisoned apparently. We ordered the veggie burger with fries. As soon as we left the restaurant for home, stomachache, nausea and diarrhea were what we dealt with overnight. Not an impressive first experience at the Deville Dinerbar. Not feeling like going again at all."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to go to if you're looking for different options. I liked that there was a lot to  choose from on the menu, including burgers & pasta. I got the Dive-In burger and the sundae shake. The burger was greasy, but overall good burger. The fries were very thin. I didn't even eat half of them because there was no taste. No complaints on the shake. The food was a 4/5 stars. What brings my rating down to 3 stars was the service. My waiter was MIA most of the time. I would understand if the restaurant was busy, but it was not busy at all. Good number of people, but not packed. It took a long time for the waiter to get back to order my food and then again when asking for the check."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I were visiting from nyc and dropped in for dinner.  The service was great and the food was even better.  A couple of us had the ahi tuna salad which fantastic.  Some also had the bad girl pasta and cleaned their plates.  We were too full for dessert but were definitely tempted.  Will definitely come back when we're back in montreal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to deville Dinebar for my birthday last night and were very pleased.  The drinks were absolutely amazing, of course I had a delicious fish bowl! My husband had another drink that was extremely well crafted and tasted amazing for such a strong drink.  The food was fabulous, service was excellent by all staff that we dealt with! The only two things I would say was that it was a little quick, which is a negative or positive depending on the night. Also a little more pricey than expected, so we know we won't be able to go often as one of our regular spots. Great time, will be back again!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I met here for drinks one Friday night so I can't comment on the food other than the menu looked really well put together, with tantalizing dishes that would make a salary-man and his belly very happy.  Despite this glow of comfort and camaraderie I did experience, upon ordering my first cocktail - an \"Old Fashioned\"-  a flush of cantankerousness when asked if I wanted my Old Fashioned made in some new-fangled kind of way.  Seriously, is nothing sacred anymore? New-fangled Old Fashioneds???  Harrumph! Anyway, my old school Old Fashioned was* okay*. Maybe I should have taken my server up on his offer after all...  My second cocktail on the other hand was a Manhattan so amazingly concocted that I regained my religion and faith in the bartender at the first sip.  There's a great vibe to the place. Not so loud that you have to learn sign-language or lip-reading but not so hushed as to want to offer condolences to anyone that happened to be dressed in black."}
{"text":"Loved it! Cool modern diner vibe with groovy playlist and super friendly staff. Great cocktails & fun American food with twist. Family friendly. Ages 10+...our kids can't wait to go back. Check out the menu online...it's as good as it sounds."}
{"text":"A restaurant named Deville has to have an old-school fill right? Well Deville Dinerbar definitely does.  It is reminiscent of an old 50's style diner but with a modern twist to include neon lights and all.    When we were seating at our table my wife and I were instantly talking about how the feel of the restaurant made us think of Elvis.  The look reminded us of a rock-a-billy style that was prominent back then.  The service was great, our server was quick with drinks and ensure they were never empty.  The food came out quick and was cooked the way we wanted. As for the food, I ordered a burger.  The Deville Burger to be exact.  It was a double patty burger with the Deville sauce. I figured if its named after the restaurant I couldn't go wrong.  Oh boy was I right, the burger came to the table and it lived up to the hype.  A tall oversized double patty burger that was sure to crush any hunger pains I may have.  Not only was it large, but it was delicious.  The meat was cooked very well and was just as juicy as you could ask for.  The Deville sauce was a delectable and welcome addition to the meal. The fires were fries.  Simple yes, but cooked very well and seasoned perfectly.   Overall the Deville is a great spunky place for one to go if they are looking for an old school style restaurant with that modern fill.  The food is sure to please, both large in size and big in flavor."}
{"text":"Diner le 19 mars 2015 Service excellent  Repas du jour Bento style,  très  bon avec tout dans une assiette,  de la soupe au dessert...  Voir photo La soupe boeuf et orge était vraiment bonne"}
{"text":"Reached out to the restaurant as requested via Yelp and did not receive a response. I'm not expecting anything in terms of compensation or equivalent. I didn't even except a response But if you're reaching out to someone, most prefer if it's followed through:"}
{"text":"Great place, cool vibe and the prices are on point.  Its a great place to try and has something for everyone.  Chicken and waffles with fries for me though.    The decor is fun and comfortable and great for a group.    Oh yea and MILKSHAKES!  Try them out and I'm sure you will be back!"}
{"text":"It's hard to rate this place as a vegetarian... it's a great place for drinks with girl friends (though pricey). However for food it's a hit or miss. Went with a large group of non vegetarians, not everyone was happy with their burgers, salmon was overdone, mac and cheese wasn't hot enough... presentations were all very nice though. Oh and the chocolate cake was horrible. The buttercream tasted like Crisco, while the bottom cake layer had a garlicky taste to it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Weak drinks. Come with friends for the food if you've already been pre-gaming."}
{"text":"It was a fantastic experience. The food here is awesome, the atmosphere is good, and the service is great as well."}
{"text":"What initially attracted me to Deville Dinerbar was the funky decor and atmosphere - something akin to a classic diner colliding with an electronica soundtrack in an explosion of 80s neon.  During my first visit, as the glowing pink and purple washed over us, I was introduced to now one of my favorite EDM groups, Oliver (thanks for the track identification, SoundHound!)  But more importantly, the food is actually awesome, and comes in huge portions.  We've been twice now, and both times I've been extremely impressed with both the quality and amount you get.  I've tried the meatloaf and one of the steaks, and the wife tried the salad with chicken (which was amazing, they basically put all the meat of a full chicken in there).  So good.   Service was attentive and friendly as well, which was a plus.  Previously we came in the winter and sat downstairs, which was a little nicer and less jam packed.  Obviously more busy in the summer, we got sat upstairs, and it definitely was a little on the toasty side with all the people and too few BTUs from the AC, but the water was quickly refilled and we survived fine.  After this latest visit, Deville Dinerbar has officially earned the highest distinction of being a place we will regularly visit on each of our yearly trips to Montreal.  Bring on the hot pink!"}
{"text":"This place definitely delivers on a food orgasm.  Came here and ordered solely apps to share.  Everything we had was absolutely delicious, especially the bacon wrapped hot dogs, where the wiener just exploded with flavour.  Even the fried calamari, which I didn't think it was possible to differentiate on, was delicious, with a very nice nuance of black pepper.  The only dish I likely wouldn't order again would be the lobster rolls (I'm more a fan of the hot buttery ones as opposed to cold mayo).  But then again, if someone put them in front of me, I wouldn't turn them down.  Just wanted to note that the service was also great.  We came here on a Friday night, where it was slammed, and sat at the bar.  We could see the bartender having to shuffle a million orders from both the restaurant and the bar.  Yet, he was very attentive, we got our food in a reasonable amount of time, and he even occasionally stopped to make small talk with the tables."}
{"text":"I was expecting a diner, but this restaurant is not close. It has the ambience of a cocktail bar, the prices of a high end steak house, and portion size a dieting model would appreciate. I eat out often, working in cities across the US, EU, and Canada. At this restaurant everything has been engineered to minimize cost and maximize profit. Fom the extra narrow beer glass and mass market beer, to $8 for a small bowl of green beans, to the $30 to $42 mains, has been optimized for profit at the expense of you the customer. Every meal is precisely setup so that you will change something to increase you cost snd add more profit. The food was OK but I would not go back they are too busy maximizing owner profits at the expense of customer value. Located across from the YMCA, ironic."}
{"text":"Interesting concept - half bar & half old school diner. The decor / atmosphere is very much bar / club but the menu is 100% diner (but with some interesting twists).   Service was very good. We walked in on a Saturday night at 10pm and seated immediately, without a reservation. The restaurant was probably 90% full at that time.   They have an interesting range of cocktails & martinis. Beer selection was a major disappointment - only Coors, Molson and Rickards on tap. They have a custom house beer served in a bottle called \"Deville Blonde Ale\" which was OK. Given the range awesome Quebec craft beers, the selection needs to be expanded. Also a decent wine selection.  Food portions were humungous, probably too big (and I have a big appetite). Prices were above average but ultimately fair given the portion size and setting. These dishes can be split into 2-3 meals.            We started with the deep fried dill pickles - a total disappointment. They were clearly over fried or refried a way too many times. Yuck! The table next to us ordered the Ahi sashimi taco app which looked amazing.  I ordered the Meat Loaf plate. They used a combo of Veal, Beef and Pork with aged cheddar cheese in the middle. The loaf was wrapped in bacon. It was probably the best meatloaf I ever had in a restaurant (but not as good as my mom's). It was served with mashed potatoes, carrots and asparagus. Also included a mushroom & truffle ragu which was a little too salty. A good dish overall.  My companion ordered the Fat Cat burger which again was ridiculously large. There was no way to eat the burger \"as is\". It's served on a large brioche bun with two burgers, ribs, cheddar and a root beer house mayo sauce. Ribs were a little fatty but the burger was A-OK. A large order of fries were served on the side.  Not sure I would return very often as the food is very unhealthy and the portions super sized... but if you have a craving for comfort food in a night club setting, give it a try.  BK"}
{"text":"Loved our waitress in spring 2017.  Food was solid and loved they had kid options.  Food was solid American style.  Would return without question, just don't expect something unique."}
{"text":"Cest le genre de restaurant parfait pour feter une fete ou un enterrement de vie de garcon ! La bouffe est flyé, mais surtout excellente !   Il font aussi beaucoup de drink le fun pour pimenter un peu plus le party !   Seul point negatif le service est beaucoup trop rapide en 50 minutes ils avaient tout servis ( drink, entree, repas) j'avais un peu l'impression de me faire gaver !"}
{"text":"I like the drinks more than the food. Had the meatloaf there with some of the apps. The apps tasted like they came from a box and the meat loaf wasn't any spectacular. I've also has a burger there that wasn't worldly either.   I would suggest against eating there but their drinks are quite good."}
{"text":"Great decor - I love the Art Deco sort of feel  The ahi tuna tacos everyone is raving about deserve all the adulation they're getting Really awesome even if they were a bit messy to eat. 5 oz of tuna! Well worth the price!   Our waiter was friendly and helpful but seemed easily distracted We had to wait a bit too long to get our water.  Will be back to try the vegan burger at some point."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week and have had almost every item in the menu never had a bad meal ask Paul for a mojito"}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal here with two friends recently.  Started out with a tasty cocktail called the Black Cherry Lemonade, it definitely could have used more than the usual 1oz shot of rum in it but it was good, just not sure if it's worth the $11 price tag.  Numerous things on the menu that I would have liked to try but narrowed it down to two and I asked the waitress if she would recommend the ribs or the bacon weaved  meatloaf and I pretty much knew right away she would recommend the more expensive ribs (and she did) but thought I would ask anyway.  I went with the ribs and yes, they were excellent.  Fall off the bone meat, a pretty big portion and delicious.  The side of shoe string fries were good as well but definitely needed to be alot hotter, they came out luke warm.    My friends ordered the bacon weaved meatloaf which I did try and very much enjoyed and it also comes with some meaty truffle mushrooms which were fantastic and my other friend ordered the Bad Girl Pasta consisting of a linguine with a thick spicy sauce and a heaping of assorted seafood.  A nice mixture of mussels, large shrimp, clams and meaty scallops, she said it was definitely delicious but it's also one of the most expensive menu items at $33.  I've read many reviews praising the service of the waitresses but maybe we just  caught one on a bad night because ours was absolutely nothing to write home about.  A bit snippy when taking drink orders, didn't come back to refill any drinks for quite some time and was just an overall unpleasant gal.   I would definitely return to try out many more offerings from the menu though."}
{"text":"Came here when in town for work under the advisement of coworkers that had stopped in before. Overall, a very fancy diner with pricey but good food. However, the atmosphere just felt weird. Beer selection is pretty terrible, and we weren't very happy that they seated 5 grown men in a booth meant for 4 ppl, tops. May go back and sit at a real table, or even the bar itself (waitresses and bartender were definitely easy on the eyes)."}
{"text":"Lovely place, the staff is great, pro, fast and very gentle. I went there a couple of times for aving some drinks and eat some of their nice and fancy dishes. I liked their lobster sandwitch, you can really taste the lobster and feels very fresh. The cheeseburger is great, you should try that the first time you go there. The place is fancy and cozy, I liked it there, would go back there with pleasure."}
{"text":"You know a burger is good when you can't fit it in your mouth. I ordered the FatCat burger (plus I added bacon, because that's just how I roll) and it was a great burger. It was quite delicious.  If you plan to get dessert, make sure to order the beignets when you order your main course. It takes 30 minutes for the kitchen to make them, so they will bring them out nice and hot for you once you are done ravaging your burger. But be prepared, you cannot eat just one, and you will leave with a beignet food baby. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food here is great (drinks not so much though), but they subject their female staff to some real buffoons at this restaurant and clearly don't do anything to remedy sexual harassment as policy. I just won't come back on principle."}
{"text":"Would give them 5 stars but the green rice didn't do it for me , there should be two more rice options, the deserts are awesome and the drinks too and the service is ok!"}
{"text":"I've been to Montreal for business three times... And while I try to visit new places this is always on my list... Just amazing!!! Endless choices"}
{"text":"I came back to Deville because some of my friends wanted to go for a fun lunch on a Tuesday. I was pleasantly surprised, I was craving a really good burger and what I got was AMAZING (black label), and they cooked it medium which is very rare in Montreal. A few wine bottles are also 50% off on Tuesdays so all in all, I guess im changing my mind when it comes to Deville, depending what you order! Enjoy"}
{"text":"For a diner its a five star, trendy and great tasting food.  The music is very good as well 80s music , great milk shakes , fries ,overall I loved this place , nice bar , off a Main Street , people coming n going . Overall very happy"}
{"text":"I was skeptical but to my delight Deville blew me away. Love the interior, love the menus, love the food and love the atmosphere.  I ordered the pear-brie burger alongside a mimosa. I don't have anything bad to say I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. It was delicious and one of the top burgers I've indulged in (and I've had my fair share of burgs). It's a decent helping and you also get a heaping amount of fries. I would say the food + the atmosphere is worth the price."}
{"text":"Waitress aggressively harangued us to order the special drinks and entrees. I have never felt so pressured in a restaurant! We finally convinced her that we just wanted vodka on the rocks for cocktails. The seating is really cramped, restaurant is overly warm and plays (bad) music so loud that you have to scream to be heard. But the worst part comes when tried to order dinner. We ordered one entree and an appetizer as another entree but the waitress told us we had to order at least two entrees and an appetizer because we had drinks, and that it was a law. I explained that we weren't that hungry that we would just finish our drinks and leave but she said that drinking without eating was forbidden. At that point we asked to speak to a manager who quickly explained that they couldn't serve alcohol without food, so we told him we certainly did try to order food, he apologized and left. The chicken entree was passable and the ahi tuna tacos were just okay...mostly salad in a taco shell with a slice of tuna on top which was disappointing. Considering the prices in this restaurant we were expecting better. We couldn't wait to get out of this place...worst night in Montreal! NOTE on Manager's reply:  The problem was we HAD ordered dinner. The waitress told us we must order at least one appetizer and two entrees. She was misinformed and rude about it. The comment below just underscores the fact that the staff just does not listen/pay attention to what their customers are saying, he obviously didn't understand my complaint!"}
{"text":"I have been to Deville Dinebar one other time and remembered they had a fun menu for drinks which inspired my second visit on a cold winter evening.  I had made reservations using open table for 4 people at 5 pm. Making my way up to the second floor was a nuisance, as there is one long alley/walkway for clients and the staff to use. No coat hooks nearby with little space for storing personal items. The layout on the second floor is very crammed compared to the spacious first floor.   Funny story: the hostess placed me and my friends at two separate tables when we had one reservation under my name. How does that happen??? When I asked our waiter in regards to the mix up, he termed it \"a glitch in the system\". Glitch or confusion?   Menu: the menus are bulky and rather large to use in a tiny space you're stuck in. Yet these menus are fun! Drink specials are offered daily -and I was surprised to even see a fish bowl menu, haven't seen fish bowls around in Mtl. I ended up ordering gummies on the beach with their 2$ off the candy bar menu on Thursdays. This drink was a twist on a sex on the beach with gummy bears that tasted oddly gelatinous because they were served chilled-(for 11$ it was an ok drink). The food menu was on the pricey side. Starting at 20$ on average going up to 40$ per main course. They specialize in American cuisine. I tried the ahi tuna tacos (4/5) for 22$ that came in 3 servings-i really enjoyed the flakey taco shell with the slaw and a genius slice of tuna-lightly grilled on the outside. For my main course: I had the short back beef ribs with Mac n cheese (3/5) the portion was very generous and presentation was beautiful. The meat was cooked super well, very tender, but the seasoning was a tad on the salty side. Whereas, the mac n cheese was a bit on the underseasoned side. The two served together didn't really jive well for me. I was glad to have tried it.  Service: I wasn't too happy with the service we received, frankly because I felt rushed into ordering right away. I really appreciated the fact the servers knew the menu inside out, they were good with making recommendations -but a lot of the items from the drink menu were also missing.   This was an eventful dining experience but for the 100$ I dropped I would've rather gone with a more upscale restaurant in old Montreal.  Overpriced meals for the quality of the food you get!"}
{"text":"The name is deceiving because this restaurant is more diner themed than an actual diner. The food is far more upscale than you'd imagine. Any dish with the rotisserie chicken is fab but the macho salad is a perfect lunch pick; even the lunch size is massive and the flavors mix very well. Sizable menu for all meals of the day so you're sure to find something!"}
{"text":"Huge menu Great cocktails Decent burgers 5/5 Lamb Shank Mediocre Steaks (good preparation but quality of steak itself is mediocre) Some appetizers attempt at asian style fusion cuisine but kind of just end up a little weird(not entirely terrible though)"}
{"text":"I continue to love to come here because you cant go wrong.  I've been frequenting this spot for awhile now and it really hits the ball out of park. The food is really well prepared and the menu is always interesting. They rotate some meals in and out throughout the year.   I just had a Shephards Pie with braised beef that was really amazing. Their puff pastry was spot on, the potatoes were silky, and the beef was tender. My partner had a bourbon glazed steak that was also prepared nicely with a heaping pile of fried onions.  The drinks here are also top notch, I've reviewed it before some years ago but they're still really good. And such a colorful drink menu as well.  The only downside I would have to say is the price. It's a bit too expensive in my opinion , but because of the consistent quality of food that I've gotten here I cant dock a star."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal recently for a long weekend and fell in love with this place.  I liked it so much I went for dinner two nights in a row.  They have lots of unique drinks to choose from. The lovely ladies behind the bar were very attentive and helpful.  They really made the experience special.  The food was always excellent and the drinks were delicious.  The atmosphere was really lively and fun.  They also have a roof top patio when the weather permits."}
{"text":"An upscale diner with a cool atmosphere. My girlfriend had the lobster BLTA sandwich and I had the prime rib sandwich. The lobster was reported as being \"OK\" but I thought the prime rib sandy was pretty good. Fries were a little cold for both of us."}
{"text":"This place amazes me (as well as my palate) more and more. I honestly think I could eat here on a regular basis and never get bored. I had the same waiter as I did last time and he remembered me. What an awesome guy, Deville certainly has exceptional service! He even hooked me up with a mouthgasm milkshake, officially known as a chocolate-nutella milkshake topped with roasted marshmellows. Seriously, a piece of heaven in your mouth. I'm in love!  Today's orders consisted of:   1) Ahi Tuna Tacos, made from fried wonton shells and an Asian slaw stuffing, topped with seared tuna slices and a fantastic wasabi lime aioli on the side. - Seared just right this time around, and words can't describe how perfect it was. It's technically an appetizer, but they fill you up just right so you don't feel overly full and heavy.  2) Blackened Cajun Salmon, served over fire roasted pablano rice, ratatouille, and topped with a roasted corn salsa. - Juicy, well seared, and spiced marvelously. Even the fire roasted pablano rice and roasted corn salsa added an extra special touch, giving all your senses quite the joyride.   3) Fat Cat Burger, made up of a beef patty, as well as pulled BBQ beef ribs, aged white cheddar, shredded iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, grilled red onions, and a root beer BBQ mayo on a toasted brioche bun, with delicious matchstick fries on the side. - Large and fully loaded, definitely difficult to finish, but more delicious with every bite. The only issue here was that the beef patty was tasteless on its own and required seasoning, but at least now there was one less meat to worry about eating. The rest of the burger was great and the root beer BBQ mayo made it that much greater.  4) Southern Fried Chicken Salad, a large bowl of mixed greens, topped with fried buttermilk chicken crispers, bacon, red onions, bell peppers, corn kernels, julienned carrots, grape tomatoes, shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese, and sweet waffle croutons, tossed in a bourbon pear dressing.  - Very tasty and enjoyable 'til the last bite. The buttermilk added more flavour and moisture to the chicken, making it more rich and juicy. The veggies came fresh, and the variety of toppings kept your taste buds hungry for more.  Each and every one of us enjoyed every single bite of our meals. Not only do they taste so good, but they look so good, it almost feels sinful having to tear it all apart. But you easily get over that! :P  Until we meet again, my new found love."}
{"text":"I finally made it over to Deville's this week! My sister and I didn't know where to have lunch so she suggested we go splurge.   We walked in and the place was packed, but didn't take long to get seated. Our waitress was a bubbly and charismatic young girl. Really friendly.  My sister did the ordering, we had the Tuna taco's and the philly cheese steak spring rolls.    When the plates came everything looked delicious. We decided to start with the fresh, melt in your mouth but messy taco's. I could have eaten all three myself and been satisfied! The sauce complimented the dish perfectly. My only complaint is how expensive it was. Man, an 18$ appetizer is just madness.  The philly cheese steak spring rolls were the decadent opposite of the Tuna. The meat was tender and tasty, the rolls are crispy, and the cheese sauce was ok.  All in all it was a great lunch, it also helped that is was my sister's treat! LOL When I saw the bill for 35$ on 2 apps, I was floored.   I know you need to pay for quality and location but I think it could be slightly lowered. But I'll be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Excellent location, close to Ste Catherine street. The atmosphere is cosy (pink lights and lounge music) and definitely modern.  A designer decorated this place, as well as the menus, every single detail has been taken care of.  Cocktails are awesome ($10-$15 each) and really creative. They have specials everyday like 6 shots for $24 on Fridays.  The food is excellent and sophisticated, you can definitely tell that the cook loves his/her job!  Deville was our best experience in Montreal and we will highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here on many occasions. It's decor is one of kind... Very pink. It is a great place to wind-down after a hard days work with colleagues and, of course, alcohol.   The food is quite good with large portions. The burgers are huge and full of deliciousness. I felt like I was at old fancy diner in the USA and the fries; those thin cut fries; Yum!   The catch 22: what's great about the food is also the low pointe. As much as it's food takes me to a time and place (which is a good thing), it has a major drawback. It's heavy! The buttered buns of the burgers and those yummy fries or think crunchy onion rings can make you feel as if you need to pop your balloon  stomach with a needle.   However, they do have some fantastic \"healthier\" options. My girlfriend, known as Anny T., ordered a salad which was top.  See her review for more insight. For those who don't want indulge in those mouthwatering burgers, there is an alternative.   The price can seem a bit steep considering your getting a burger or/and fries but I can assure you that it is worth it on occasion.   I encourage you to try this place out."}
{"text":"On a snowy day in March this was a good call for a late lunch.  We had several starters meze style along with a sandwich each.  There's some imaginative stuff here, all well executed and fun.  The mac and cheese wontons, the fried pickles and the poutine were all standouts.    Cocktails were also imaginative and generous-ish.    The service was brilliant and the decor is fabulous.  Had I been in Montreal for longer I would have been back to Deville on an evening.  I imagine it's quite swishy."}
{"text":"Awesome Resto and great atmosphere. I highly recommend. Get the philly steak rolls as appetizer . Very good"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good music, friendly staff and great tasting food but...when I got home from dinner I was sick from food poisoning all night long. I hadn't eaten all day as I was saving my appetite for this meal so I know it wasn't from something else. My guess is that it was the seafood pasta.Tasted fine at the time... Paying close to $200 to be sick all night long isn't what I had in mind when I chose to come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Poor experience in this place. First of it is pretty expensive. $$$ at least for a snack or lunch. The Mini Lobster roll was super super small and had lobster shell in it. When I asked the waiter he was like 'this is normal as the mix we receive does have shell in it from the legs and tail'... excuse me for a $23 plate I expect it to be shell free, tasty and filling. Other than this the music was OK and the place was relatively empty. Wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"Was very happy with this restaurant! The food was great, menu selection was diverse, servers were friendly.  I found it a bit expensive but it's also in a touristy area. The atmosphere is very fun and well designed."}
{"text":"When I first ate at Deville's, I became an instant fan. I was instantly drawn to the modern, trendy ambiance. I also appreciate the fact that the servers are very friendly and know the menu very well.  I ordered the vegan lentil burger, which consisted of fresh, grilled eggplant, red bell peppers and asparagus. I was pleasantly surprised that it was served on a portobello mushroom \"bun.\" It was served with shoestring fries, which didn't have any special seasoning, but their simplicity is what made them so enjoyable. I really enjoy trendy restaurants that serve upbeat, healthier takes on classic foods. This is why I can't wait to come back to Deville's!"}
{"text":"Eh, I wasn't very impressed.  Pros: Good service, big portions  Cons: Taste was mediocre, prices were expensive for the type of food served   Would I go again? No."}
{"text":"I love Deville Dinerbar! It's trendy and right in the heart of downtown Montreal and it isn't a tourist-y sham like so many others in the downtown core. I would be lying if I said it wasn't overpriced, but it's tasty and fun for afterwork 5 a 7. The finger food is delicious, fried pickles and mac and cheese egg rolls-- yes please!, even the entrees are great! I loveee the meatloaf!  The ambience is fun and there is a daily drink special that has inclined me more than once to try a new elixir.  If the service was better and the price was right it would be a 5 star, but that won't stop me from going back!"}
{"text":"So.... great location, interesting decor. I'm not sure what decade they're aiming for but I'm going to go with the 80s. The service is OK. I went for lunch twice, and just wasn't blown away by the wait staff or the food. I will say this: the portions are huge, so you're getting your money's worth no matter what you order.   Fried pickles: These were OK. They basically deep fry sweet pickles. It wasn't what I expected. Good, but not 'WOW I LOVE THIS.'  Lobster BLTA (lobster salad, bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, purple mustard on a brioche bun). This was good, but the lobster was a little underwhelming as it was lacking in flavor. I opted not to eat the bread because I couldn't get my mouth around it - it was that big!  Dinerbar Club: Free-range rotisserie chicken, bacon, arugula, tomatoes, avocado, maple Dijon sauce. Again, this was huge so I didn't eat the bread. I really enjoyed this - very flavorful.   It's a fun place to go for dinner on a weekend night. For some reason, the decor just makes me feel like we shouldn't be there during lunch hour :)"}
{"text":"Good/creative food, healthy choices available. Ambience is very good for an evening meet-up with friends. You can watch sport, enjoy your food or drink and relax. Location is conveniently walking distance from metro. Staff nice too, though a bit slow! Recommended."}
{"text":"I have been to Deville Dinerbar 3 times. Each time has been great experience. Twice was Birthday occasion and once girls' day occasion.   The decor of the resto is pretty funky. The service is very amiable. Their cocktail menu and dish menu is very extensive. Every item in the menu is good; I know no one, my surroundings, ever been disappointed. My all time favorite dish is always and will Ahi Tuna taco...the taste and the mix crispy and soft and leafy texture is an absolute delight. Sadly it's a small portion as an appetizer, and expensive. Second favorite dish, that I always have fun with is Mac n Cheese wonton with marinara sauce. I discovered this creation of two items at this restaurant. Such delicious appetizer, yet expensive.  Despite the high price, I always enjoyed this place. I think Ahi Tuna taco should be a main dish with extra few tacos...;)  So I do recommend this place for the extensive succulent fusion food!"}
{"text":"We drove past this place once before and was attracted from outside. Today (New Years day) we were planning to go to Kinka Izakaya but it wasn't open, so we thought about this place to try out. The presentation of food is very appealing and the taste is equally good. Cocktail on daily special is so so but the ones from the regular menu are great. Staff is friendly and funny too. Glad that we chose this place to spend the night on New Year's Day."}
{"text":"Decided to come in for a quick lunch and ended up staying for 3 hours !  We were seated in the back which I found weird but it was okay.  They don't have that many options for food salad, few pasta dishes, a bunch of burgers and appetizers.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful but since it was 5 he left and we switched over to another guy.  We asked to be seated in the bar area so we can have drinks and relax.  Our waiter was okay at first but then barely came by and asked if I needed anything or about maybe getting me a drink. The Long Island ice tea was garbage tasted terrible BUT the old fashion drinks were great.  Two girls walked in and went upstairs to eat and I seen them come down 30 minutes later and left. I was watching all the waiters laughing at them calling them transgender and mocking one of the girls voices I was disgusted by this behaviour I called the guy over just to get him to stop talking and laughing about this girl. He came over I had a very angry looked on my face I figured he would pick up on it but no he didn't and went right back to the bar to laugh some more about the woman who left.  Half the staff is standing around doing nothing 3 people at the door just playing on their phones 2 standing in the stair case 4 laughing at the bar. I don't know how that's acceptable.  I would return but Probably not for a while.  -UPDATE- spoke with social media manager and all was handled and taken care of in a professional manner very happy to hear.  Update  Decided to finaly come for lunch and try it out again. The waiter explained how only certain promotions u can get at the bar so we had to move our seat even tho nobody was in the place. The salad with the blue cheese is usually my thing decided why not try it again and I was extremely sick from it which I find weird because there's nothing much to it besides the blue cheese. My friend had the chicken Cesar salad and he liked it but was sick after as well. I'm not sure if it was just the dressings they used but I was sick for a full day."}
{"text":"Deville is my daughter's favourite restaurant and our go to place for family celebrations.  It's an upscale diner with a funky retro feel.  The food is modern takes on diner classics.  My personal favourite is the macho salad.  Fries and burgers are excellent.  Portions are giant, bring your appetite! They have lots of fun cocktail specials and a decent wine list.  My daughter loves the milkshakes.  Service is usually prompt and friendly.  Great place to go to celebrate a birthday or other fun event."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE! I thought it was a tiny place but once entered its huge and their portions are HUGE. The food tastes amazing! My fiancé and i ordered onion ring that's covered in coconut.. wow I fell in love. My fiancé ordered hamburger and he had trouble finishing bc it was so huge. (He eats a lot but their portion is just tooo much) I ordered meatloaf and wow... they weaved it with bacon. What a heaven. They are friendly and serve the food fast! The only down side is their drinks costs  a lot but that's bc their portions are big but when you can't share with someone it's too much so you end up not ordering. It will be nice if they order drinks by size so single can order and enjoy. Overall, I recommend this place to everyone. It's great with kids and elders too."}
{"text":"Shakes are to die for and food was great. We had very good service and for the price, it was a pretty good value considering the location. I'd go back anytime."}
{"text":"Dinerbar-restaurant très tendance, ambiance tamisée rose et noir, un peu lounge, pas trop bruyant, très sympa!  Possibilité de s'asseoir au bar ou à une table Excellent service Menu très varié, prix corrects voire un peu dispendieux pour certains plats Les burgers sont apparemment très réputés, et le mien était effectivement très bon (burger du cirque); les frites sont fines et maison il me semble.. A tester!"}
{"text":"Awesome, retro restaurant and bar. Big fishbowl drinks we're fun and delicious. Staff was very friendly and attentive! Highly recommended! :)"}
{"text":"Funky, fun diner style. Fantastic cocktails and apps."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good food and drink and trendy funky atmosphere, you've found it here. I liked the food here but wasn't mind blowing.   Everything is very pink and retro with a modern twist you could say. Food options seem original and fusion style. I got the seared ahi tuna crusted with peanut butter and popcorn. The sweet and salty actually worked very well together and was on a bed of curry risotto. Comes with a small Waldorf kale salad but wasn't a fan. Too much dressing and tasted like nail polish, although one of their more popular salad.$39  Food is pricey here. Each main is $30 up. Apps are $15+  Our server was wonderful and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Giving Deville 5/5 for their Delicious calamari.  It was so good we ordered it twice.  Other items are very good we enjoyed the lamb shank, honey and BBQ ribs.  The meats were fall of the bone tender and the smoke flavor was to the bone. Portion sizes were huge, we could barely finish.    We ordered the driink special for the night which was a Mojito.  It was pineapple flavored but the flavors worked well together and the bartender mixed them perfectly.  We ordered another round of them but they weren't as good as the first--I suspect a different bartender mixed them.   Service was excellent no complaints."}
{"text":"Had the ahi tuna tacos - great taste - wonton crisp type shell with fresh tuna and a  delicious mayo type dip - complimented with a refreshing ceasar!"}
{"text":"This review is really like a 3.49 stars. While I was impressed overall with the food at Deville Dinerbar, the prices and service give me pause. I saw reviews of Deville as a high-end American style diner and though it would be safe to bring my nine year old in the late afternoon for a bite. There were other parties with kids in the dining area, yet my server was visibly disappointed that she'd been seated with a kid and wasn't going to get a huge order. I don't really get this: there's no kid's menu (and I'm not saying there should be at all), so she's still going to make money off a full-priced entree. Maybe it's that we weren't chugging down endless cocktails. Whatever. She was indifferent the whole time (though her trainee was lovely and helpful).  Speaking of cocktails, there was barely any booze in the Brooklyn iced tea. It sucks to pay $12 for a drink that's mostly mixer and crushed ice.  Now that I've done some complaining, I'm ready to cheerfully talk up the food at Deville. It's good, really good. It's diner food pumped up on yummy-steroids. The Fat Boy cheese burger is perfectly cooked to order and has a freakin' delicious braised beef short rib for a topping. The root beer bbq sauce is pretty good but people who don't like sweet will find it cloying. Deville has great matchstick fries. My nine year old had bacon wrapped hot dog sliders and fries and LOVED them.  For dessert, we took Rawan K.'s advice and got the Toasted Marshmallow shake. Incredible mix of vanilla, malt, and nutella with toasted marshmallow garnish! So sweet and good.  The check was steep for all of this, but most restaurants in Montreal are costly, so I just tried to keep it in perspective. I'm still really annoyed about the dismissive service, and I'll put this out here now to save both the restaurant and prospective customers a lot of aggravation: don't bring your kids here. Or, if you do, maybe only do it during the day.  Yeah, and Deville: please put more booze in your expensive-ass drinks."}
{"text":"Decent food. Cool resto decor. Can't complain about the food nor would I rave about it. Burgers are tasty. Lunchbox is filling"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Pink everywhere and old school diner décor. It has a super cool drink menu and I would like to try everything on it, I chose one with gummy bears in it called Gummy Bears on the beach (how cool is that???). My friend and I chose to share 3 entrees because they all looked so awesome. We chose the Tacos de Laitue \"Seoul Food\", Rouleaux de Printemps Steak et Fromage, and Macaroni et Fromage Wontons. The tacos were crazy delicious, the spring rolls were very good and the wontons were awesome with just the right amount of spice. Everything was very different from the normal and very good. My friend also ordered a drink called the Kitty Kat which looked awesome. The service was very good and friendly and available when needed. I would definitely go back to try more yummy sounding things on the menu. :) :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from fellow Yelper Tarim A.  It's a very clever take on the 60's-80's diner but making it look more sophisticated and hip.  As another review said, picture a Virgin America plane (pink lighting) but with booths and tables serving awesome innovative food.  As I was by myself this night, I just sat at the bar and the bartender was very patient yet efficient as she knew it was my first time and the bar was almost full as well.  It was quite packed and a great happening vibe.     What I ordered: General Tao Chicken Salad.  At first, it tasted a bit bland, but the presentation was so nice, I didn't want to mix it up.  However, after a while, I decided to toss it a bit and I was quite surprised. The sauce was delicious and the General Tao wasn't your typical General Tao chicken.  It was huge chunks of chicken and well seasoned.  Do you know those huge meatballs you get at Italian places?  It was like those, but I think there were somewhere around 7-10 pieces.  Each one was divine.  In addition to having all this chicken, the salad ingredients were fresh and I think it had some sprouts, those corn thingies, and other greens.  The portion size was equivalent to any entree you get at Cheescake Factory except this was so much tastier.    Verdict: If you like to drink, have quality food and large portions in a hip setting, this is a great place to go in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and that's about all that was good here.  Burger was over priced, over cooked and bland and fries were just regular.  I'd come here for a drink or a shake, not for real nourriture.    I'd sooner go to Mr Steer for a real old fashioned diner style burger."}
{"text":"This is not your typical diner service the American diner food. The restaurant had a nice chic fancy feel. Service was superb and the overall atmosphere was very poppy.   We ordered the Bad Girl Pasta as it was spoken highly of in the Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed at all. The pasta was tossed in a lobster bisque sauce that just the right amount of sweetness and creaminess. The seafood on top was very fresh. It is 100% the best seared scallops I've ever had, and I am a huge seafoodie. All the seafood were perfectly cooked and was well seasoned.   Also ordered the Seafood & Chorizo Paella. I've had many paellas in my life, this is by far my favorite. Again, it was topped with sizable tiger shrimps and the plump scallops. The rice wasn't too mushy and was full of flavor.   Overall, amazing dinner with great service and food. I highly recommend visiting, especially if you're a tourist. If my boyfriend were to propose to me, I would want him to propose here since it's kinda funky."}
{"text":"Loud and fun place that takes the \"Diner\" theme and cracks it out. Insane menu with tooo many yummy things to try. They have a limited number of steaks that have been aged for days. To die for.  Also try their fish bowl drinks. Big enough to share and then some!"}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. The portions are big but be prepared to pay a lot. Worst of all they will charge you for refills on Coke. . .how cheap is that? Service has been a problem each time I've been there. . .Disappointing really"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went on Monday with my mom and friends for \"cinco de Monday\" where bar food and drinks are $5 a piece. Super cost friendly and so delicious!!! Make sure you order dessert. Love it!"}
{"text":"The menu is good comfort food and I would say it has a few unusual choices in a good way. I personally like their meat loaf and macncheeese. The only thing I dislike is that it is pretty crowded and not a lot of room between tables"}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way first:  HUGE, as in GIGANTIC, portions...I'm talking eating competition sizes, if not bigger. I feel defeated by food.  The food:  I disliked my tempura fried lasagne..A LOT. It was a brick of lame. My crushed tomato soup was very tasty however. Hubster had the fried chicken salad with a side of mac 'n cheese (you can tell this was our first visit, who the hell has room for sides?!), we both agreed upon them being nomtastic. The parental units had a burger and a club sandwich which they enjoyed. So overall a success, just avoid that lasagne and you should be fine.   Now for the rest:  Nice & trendy décor (pink ALL the things!), young people everywhere most of them on dates it seemed (d'awww), good service and decent pricing (since you get so much).  100% worth a visit (unless you REALLY want lasagne)."}
{"text":"Awesome fried pickles! And the meatloaf entree was excellent. Highly recommend it, nice bustling atmosphere."}
{"text":"We didn't love it here. The food was on the pricey side and every entree seemed to have one odd ingredient that we didn't like. Ended up getting hotdog sliders that were very good but went elsewhere for dinner. I also got their drink special and while tasty it was very weak."}
{"text":"Deville definitely lives up to the hype and great reviews. My husband and I came on a Monday night and we were pleased to see the place lively with such a great atmosphere and a warm welcome. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because I had come here specifically for the filet and they were out. I changed my order to the Louis burger. It was pretty decent- more like a gourmet Big Mac with the Russian sauce and double patties. The lobster rolls and calamari were terrific. My husband ordered the Bad Girl pasta which I loved and had a good portion of seafood. My husband found the pasta a bit bland. However, we both agreed the winner of the evening was the apple pie with ice cream. We were both full after our meals but we still managed to demolish the dessert! Will definitely return to try their salads and ahi tuna."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant for quite some time now since it opened next to the YMCA where I used to train. Finally after a good without with the boyfriend, we decided to check this place out.  Good : The tuna tataki salad. I just came from the gym, but I'm not about to wolf down a whole burger. Hands down one of the best salads I've ever had. A bit on the heavy side, but the portion was very generous and enough to feed two. The restaurant was trendy and inviting.   Bad : Maybe this is a biased opinion because I am a bit of a health nut, but the burger was too greasy for my liking.  Bottom Line : I would definitely return, they know how to make a mean tuna tataki salad!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of veggie burgers and I think Deville Dinebar has the best veggie burger of all time.  It's made with mushrooms and includes a delicious sauce along with some kind of corn salsa.    The waiter was super nice and gave good advice on what to order.   They mix a decent gin and tonic.   The atmosphere isn't exactly my style, slightly on the tacky side, but they have lots of comfortable seating and it wasn't too loud.   NOTE: Burger is not vegan as there is parmesan in the patty."}
{"text":"been here twice on two different occasions and had a great experience, and great food and drinks, both times!  brought a group of work colleagues for dinner, called ahead and got a great table for 8 on the terrace... everyone had a wonderful time, raved about the food, and enjoyed the boozy milkshales... YUM!  the modern diner vibe is very fun"}
{"text":"This place is like fusion of everything. I had Ahi tuna tacos. The taste is good and unique but I find it's hard to eat because the taco is crispy with runny juicy sauce. If you're on a date, I won't recommend this menu. The second time I ordered the chicken waffle. The taste is ok, not too bad. The decoration is gorgeous. Both times I went with a lot of people and we can't move table much because of the how the decoration is made, so we end up packed together to fit in. The milkshake tastes nice. However, all the food is a bit pricey for what we get."}
{"text":"I got the mushroom burger that came with matchstick fries.  SO GOOD! It wasn't your typical mushroom burger which usually consists of a patty of portobello mushroom... Instead, it was a mix of mushrooms, beans, and more. Very tasty.   The ambience was really cool-- a modern take on a classic diner, which I think is exactly what they're going for.  The server was nice but he didn't check in on us to ask how we were enjoying the food which is usually pretty standard."}
{"text":"So many things to say, there's a completely different vibe at night than at day. Managed to visit in the morning and at night.   1) in the morning I seriously recommend the ahi tuna tacos, impeccable. Although slightly hard to manage the mess of eating it haha  2) the general tao chicken salad, perfect mix of flavours and wonderfully breaded chicken!  3) the bar at night is beyond fun, seriously well made drinks, the skittle me that and the kool-aid fishbowl... Wow.  The service at night is a lot better than in the morning, probably due to the pacing of the day but other than that, really well decorated restaurant!"}
{"text":"The ratings on Yelp made me try this place out. Depending on your taste, it's a little overrated. The decor deserves 5 stars itself . It's gorgeous but it's really small. You cannot get in without reservations on the weekends. We waited over an hour because we didn't know this. They basically turned us away and as we were walking down the street, the hostess chased after us to let us know she found a seat. THAT was awesome of her. There's really no waiting area except a small front entrance so on a really cold day, it's not ideal to wait . The menu was very interesting. Had alot of new things I never seen but decided just to have a burger. It was decent. It was a little too much bigger if there's such a thing. It was just too dry . My boyfriend loves his chicken tho. It was little over priced for the food that you get. And if you are looking for a quiet atmosphere, this is NOT it. It's super loud and everyone is literally sitting right next to each other, you can barely hold a conversation. It's very tight and you will run into a fast moving waiter if you aren't careful. Overall enjoyed trying a new place but wasn't a 5 star for me."}
{"text":"Recently visited Deville Dinerbar with a group of friends. Great warm and relaxing atmosphere. Great interior decor..classy. Service also great ...warm and friendly. Food was really great.....burger meat was juicy and packed with flavors....accompanied by crisp fries....would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We are traveling from California USA and wanted to try this place based on ratings and menu. I am not disappointed, food was good. We ordered inside out burger, a BBQ chicken sandwich and wonton Mac n cheese. It was all good. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful. I will eat here again next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Great place on a Sunday morning.  Super quiet and friendly staff. Had the lobster BLTA and spicy caesar at the bar.  The matchstick fries are the best I've found in Canada.  They use idaho and not Yukon potatoes. The lobster BLTA came on a sesame crusted brioche bun.  Perfect lobster salad with lettuce, bacon, tomatoes and avocado.  Can't wait to try their burgers."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Server was forgetful and slow but nonetheless the food was amazing! We have ordered the bad girl pasta and the honey glazes chicken. Both were a party of flavours! For dessert we shared pain perdu. Will definitely go there again the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Well cooked, juicy. Stacked with lots of toppings. Can't lie I would go back absolutely."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and food! Large menu selection, something to suit every taste. Pricey but I feel it's worth it for the great atmosphere and what's on the table. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Way slicker than your average diner.   You won't find boring milkshakes and burgers here. Their menu is intense... innovative apps like bacon wrapped hot dog sliders and mini lobster rolls. Decadent entrees - lots of different steak and seafood options. Burgers, gourmet salads and pastas, boozy shakes. The list goes on and on. The restaurant is set up to look like a flashy old school diner and they pull it off well.   The menu was a overwhelming! My fiance knew he wanted a classic burger and fries, but I took a bit longer to settle on my order. I went with the macho salad - rotisserie chicken, avocado, goat cheese, corn, dates, tomatoes and thick and crunchy cornbread croutons tossed in a tangy vinaigrette. The salad came served in a massive bowl and was filling and delicious. The rotisserie chicken was moist and well seasoned and was definitely the highlight of the salad bowl. My guy's burger was juicy and dripping with cheese. I really liked the side of thin and crunchy shoestring fries. The only downside is price - expect to pay over 20 dollars for a burger or salad. Luckily the hearty portions made up for that.  I'd suggest making a reservation. We didn't, and were only able to sit at one of the high tops and not in the main dining room. Completely fine, but I also didn't expect this at 9 PM on a weekday. So call ahead for sure. Denville Dinerbar is a great spot for quality food in a trendy environment. I have a feeling that it's impossible to go wrong with anything on this menu."}
{"text":"Best meal after a long flight to Montreal.  Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch, the cookie milkshakes have actual cookies in them!!! The drinks are amazing and the chicken and beef ribs plate is to die for. The chicken breast is moist and the ribs have very tasty sauce on them. We also got the seared tuna tacos and I hate tacos but this specific dish was amazing. I have been dreaming of that dish ever since."}
{"text":"My friend picked this diner to eat tonight. I wasn't thrilled about it. If you like big portions this is the place to go. Im not big on junk food so this was not my kind of place. Fried won tons with Mac and cheese inside had no flavour. Pork belly sliders was fatty. Dessert banana cream pie was good and make sure it is shared with someone, like I said they believe in  everything  bigger is better.."}
{"text":"This is a summary review since we have eaten here 6 times in the past year. The food is always consistently good. I love the southwest chicken salad. My friends and family always love them but they are hard to finish since the servings are so huge. The burgers are excellent.  My daughter loves having a milkshake there (but typically has to leave half her meal to bring home to save room)  Definitely a fun spot, especially before a movie (there is a movie theatre around the block)"}
{"text":"We made a last minute reservation and there was no problem! The booth is small and comfy, and is great for catching up with friends! Le Poulet au Gaufre is to die for!!! It's even better than the one from Prohibition!   Drinks are on the pricier side. I ordered the Aloha cocktail and was disappointed with the drink being a glass inside a coconut and not just a drink in a coconut.  Will come back one day for their famous donuts and their chicken waffle!"}
{"text":"Yum!  We decided to eat at this restaurant during a recent trip to Montreal due to the good Yelp reviews. It did not let us down!  The decor of the restaurant is very bright and slightly cheesy; lots of black, white and pink. It didn't bother me though and I thought the restaurant had a fun vibe because of it.  My family of 6 ordered a variety of food for dinner. I think between the table we tried the lamb, salmon, meatloaf, shepherd's pie, the mac and cheese wontons and the mini bacon-wrapped hot dog sliders. I personally ordered the shepherd's pie, it was different than your average shepherd's pie as it had a light croissant crust on top, but it was nice comfort food. I think everyone else liked their food as well besides the mac and cheese wontons, which my sister said could have used a sharper cheese and weren't very flavorful.  Prices are on the higher end I thought but the portions are large. The service was pretty attentive if a little slow. Overall this was a good experience and a nice dinner with a good variety of options for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Deville Dinerbar is truly the place to be to grab a few drinks and food with your friends. The atmosphere is sort of bar/lounge/restaurant which makes this place great. I had a Deville burger which was juicy and rich with flavor. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and it really is a comfortable place to enjoy.  I would certainly recommend this bar to anyone looking for good time in Montreal."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to this place for the longest time. As expected, the inside looks great, love the rose color theme, everything looks fancy and classy. Our waiter was super nice (and handsome). Since I had a eye on this place for super long, I just went full out and ordered one appetizer, two mains, and one dessert. I shared the whole thing with a friend.  - ahi tuna tacos: seriously the highlight of our meal. Really got surprised by how good it tastes. Quite original as well, since I never had sashimi tacos before. The sauce in the taco was sweet and the extra mayo sauce on the side went super well with the taco. They were generous with the tuna (for $22, they better be lool) and the platting was just so instagramable. - lobster btl: i thought it was impossible to go wrong with lobster, avocado, bacon but the burger was quite disappointing. Despite all the good ingredients i just felt like they just don't go well together. I'll say it was my least favorite. - bad girl pasta: ordered it based on the reviews on yelp. Maybe I was expectecting too much, but I was not blown away by the taste. The seafood were really fresh, especially the clams super huge, soft and chewy. There was part of the pasta that was clearly undercooked. Probably won't order again. - donuts: they wrote on the menu that we had to order the donuts 30min ahead, but since it was not a busu day the waiter said that its gonna be ready in 10. Its my first time having a desert that costs 18$, but actually its a fair price since it was enough to share for 4. We still managed to finish it all (We skip supper that day). Suuuper good. The donuts were hot and the chocolate mousse and the caramel sauce on the side were cold, perfect combo. The donut itself is not sweetened, so you have to eat it with the side sauce. My second favorite after the tacos.   Overall, it is quite pricey, but their menu is original and the quality you get is kinda worth it. Anyways, come if you don't mind paying more just to feel extra fancy, coz with all the deco and awesome presentation you will."}
{"text":"This is a great stop in downtown. I have mixed feelings on the decor. It has a sort of futuristic-80's look to it. Lots of chrome and glowing overhangs. But it's certainly different.   Service was great, some of the friendliest we've had in the area.   Food-wise, all good. This is upscale diner food done really well. The ribs were fantastic, and sandwiches are MASSIVE. Overall, prices are on the high side - but portions are huge.    Special props to the Louis' Lunch menu item. Respect."}
{"text":"Awful service. Very unfriendly towards tourists. Waiter made strange comments about massage parlors and made our whole party uncomfortable. Food was above average."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice modern dinner decor. I recommend trying their appetizers, especially the tuna taco.  The main plates like the blackened chicken is quite good too."}
{"text":"Retro-American Diner with attitude and class.  This place has all the classics like burgers, meatloaf, and pot pie, but I was really hungry so I went straight for the prime rib, the big boy cut.    Let's back up a bit, this place looks really classy, we are in downtown YUL by the way.  The decor is super modern with a retro flair and this attitude falls into the food as well.  When you first walk in there is a bar to your left that shows off the drinks available and the bartenders that are ready to deal out some drinks.  Now back to the food, the prime rib entree was large, like really big.  Normal humans should split this meal if you are getting the larger cut or you have your next meal waiting for you.  The prime rib was prepared, pink and slightly red in the middle, the outside had a slight crust/bark on it and it was heavenly.  The drinks expertly prepared by the awesome bartenders were on point as well.  The only downside of this place is walking out of there a little poorer than I walked in."}
{"text":"Reserved there with a group of friends on the first night of poutine week. Little did we know they 'ran out' of poutine and it was 7pm. They had apparently sold out during lunch. Considering the plethora of poutine night posters in the restaurant it was less than impressive. We also couldn't understand how they hadn't made more throughout the day? We told the waiter that we went there specifically for the poutine and wondered if the chef could make us any kind of poutine, even if it was just fries gravy and cheese. Not only did they say no but didnt make it up to us in any way. Probably the worse dining experience on an event night one can have. We then overheard the waiters asking what seemed to be the manager if they could tell the people as they walk in that they have no poutine and the answer was 'no they will just leave, tell them when they have settled and ordered'. We will never go again. They could've at least called us to ask if we had reserved for poutine week, as they had run out. Would've given it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Meh. Nice place but the food was just alright. Didn't even order drinks and our bill was $100. And top it off the fire alarm went off for a good 5 minutes during our dinner."}
{"text":"Pulled lamb pasta was fantastic. The \"nice little house salad\" was good but arugula/beets in balsamic for $12 is on the steeper side. Plating is above average. Service solidly good but unexceptional. Ambience: lounge lighting + funk/house music playlist give this place a trendy vibe, great for dates or cooling with youthful coworkers. Downstairs has a more casual drinks feel, upstairs to the back is nice for dining. 4 stars on the strength of the pasta/ambience.  Bonus: bathrooms are impressively hotel-quality clean."}
{"text":"Tonight my friend and I made a reservation at Deville's, with high expectation. The menu, was well designed, offered something for everyone and we were both extremely excited to try some of Deville's famous offerings. After 30 minutes we were read the specials but we were not asked for our drink order. Once our order was finally placed, our food came fast, hot and delicious! Sadly though, the server we had was slow, inattentive and seemed overly concerned with to his trainee, rather than being attentive to his tables. As two experienced servers ourselves, my friend and I were far from impressed. The food and decor made this venue worthy of my recommendation, however my review about the service will absolutely be mentioned to that referral."}
{"text":"Huge portions! My favorite was the Philly Cheesesteak Egg Roll. I would come back here to try their other items. Definitely come here with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"A solid 4 star restaurant in downtown Montreal. If you don't like high bills, don't go there to eat. You are paying for the location too!   First of all, the decor and staff are stellar. Very attentive waiter who I believe was training someone. They gave us excellent service!   I started with a Mai Tai and I am craving another one today. I would ditch serving it in a coconut just because it takes up too much space on the table and it loses it's cuteness about 3 minutes after you get it.   Started with apps of wonton wrapped Mac and cheese. Excellent! I would go again just for this.  My 4 year old didn't care for it but she only wants KD Mac n cheese!  Also had the chicken tenders on a waffle. I was not a fan but my husband was. I hate sauce, syrup, relishes it whatever and was expecting the maple syrup sauce on the side. Nope, it was all over making my waffle and tenders soggy before my fork hit it.  Hubby and I spilt an inside out burger since we were so full. It's a burger. Not much to say about it. Wasn't bad and wasn't epic. Almost everything they serve is on a brioche bun so you better like that...  Where I had a problem was that there was no posted child's menu and when the waiter told us the pasta options (butter or tomato sauce) I asked if we could add a single meat ball to the pasta and he said no. I ended up ordering her a 19$ plate to get meatballs and she barely touched it. Options for kids should be better as they are crazy picky eaters. I didn't want a free meatball, I wanted to pay for it but was told no.  Also, we asked for a side of purple mustard and we got charged $2 for that... It's a small portion for that price!   Overall, it was a good meal and the service was great. Is there room for improvement? Of course there is, everyone has room for improvement.  Will I be back? Yes, next Monday actually!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Only been once and I've been wanting to go back ever since. Cool fishbowl drinks."}
{"text":"Great food, but it's pricey. Nevertheless, I really like this spot. Came here for the second time decided to try the \"Bad Girl Pasta\" dish, LOVED IT... Don't know the reason for the name but the food was not bad AT ALL. Definitely not worth $36, so I will never buy it again, but it really was delicious. (being from Nova Scotia, 3 scallops & 3 muscles should never be $36.00).  With that said, this is a GREAT spot for a group of friends, a date or if u want to order takeout, or sit at the bar alone, it's all good to do that as well."}
{"text":"HUGE, huge portions, murrica-style. Save yourself the food coma and share some dishes among your party. It's a very trendy spot with a lively bar, but also serves good food. I loved the bad girl pasta; it's a little on the pricier side but has good quality seafood, served in a yummy lobster sauce. One tiny thing - pasta tastes like the store bought type but I'm just being picky at this point. The French onion soup is delicious and hot, with a good cheesy top. Meatloaf and hanger steak both came with a gigantic mountain of mashed potatoes. Our server was extremely cheerful and attentive. The disappointing part was actually the drinks - I got the black cherry lemonade that was recommended to me (also on the Hollywood cocktails list that are $2 off one Wednesday's) - had the artificial cherry taste. Overall a good dining place!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try. All hamburgers are cooked medium well.   Hamburger was decent with an average  price tag of $18.   Somewhat overpriced.   Fountain soda is mainly ice and no free refills.   They made me add 4 dollars to substitute my fries for salad. Anyone who does this will be upset with that decision.  The salad was so small and awful. It was offensive. extremely small. Lol.   Got a delicious chocolate cake for dessert with a scoop of ice cream so small it was also offensive lol   Although the waiter was kind the service was terrible despite the place being empty at the time. Think it's cause we asked for English menus. Lol.   I'm not sure if I'd ever go here again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for overpriced and overrated this would be the restaurant!  It's about $20 for a burger and you'd expect something delicious for that price but honestly it wasn't even that great.  The waits are long, the music is stale music from the 80's--get with the times, and the service is slow.  They also serve corn-fed American beef.  I could hardly think of anything more unhealthy: cows aren't supposed to eat corn and people aren't supposed to eat beef from cows eating corn since it makes them sick and unhealthy.  That's why most places have switched to grass-fed beef, unlike this overpriced joint stuck in the 80's.  Needless to say I won't be coming back and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"Deville Dinerbar en plein milieu du centre-ville est en résumé une bonne place où manger un burger. Bonne ambiance avec un long bar pour les amateurs. Sinon on peut voir un petit look rétro dans les tables et la décoration.  Ce n'est pas la place avec le plus de choix de burger, disons qu'il y a peu de choix dans les variantes de burgers. J'ai été obligé d'y aller avec le burger classique, le burger Deville. Celui-ci semblait appétissant au premier regard. Les frites sont aussi très bonnes. Vous remarquerez que celles-ci sont un peu comme des frites McDo, mais en moins grosse. C'est un peu comme des McDo juliennes.  Le burger comprenait deux boulettes de boeuf, pour être certain d'avoir de la misère à se le mettre en bouche. Ce qui est un peu décevant, car personne ne veut avoir à manger son hamburger en l'ouvrant. Disons que c'est dur le rentrer dans la bouche pour prendre une bouchée.  Je n'oserais recommander de prendre une salade ( ah ah ah), mais ma copine avait pris une salade et je dois dire qu'elles sont quand même bien en consistance pour une salade. Ne la prenez pas pareil, prenez un burger."}
{"text":"Really cool place a few blocks over from the hotel I was staying at. Stopped in for dinner and while the beer menu was lacking, the dining experience was still a great one.  I went with the Bacon Weave Meatloaf. Oddly enough it was the bacon that left me most unenthused in the meal. The meatloaf was tasty, the mashed potatoes were great and plentiful, the root vegetables accompanying were perfectly cooked yet crispy, and the gravy was rich and tasty. But the bacon, just seemed thin and less notable of the flavours.  Still, washed down with a pint of Creemore beer while listening to the sweet sounds of funk and soul in the background, I couldn't help but enjoy my dining experience. Yeah, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good time at Deville and almost always love what I'm eating. For my full review, please visit: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/10/10/deliciously-decadent-deville-dinerbar-treatyoself/"}
{"text":"It's hard to describe the Deville Dinerbar experience without being too cliché.   \"It's a diner.....but hip\"  Now that I say it out loud, that's something your parents would say to describe a \"cool\" restaurant. But really, Deville Dinerbar manages to pull off a contemporary twist on the 80's retro diner with great service, sassy drinks, and damn-good food. The menu is beyond diverse and the drinks remind me of a neon-themed Hawaii 5-0.  If I could visualize desribe the decor at Deville, it'd be a 1980's Animotion music video meets 2014 South Beach (well I guess it's now 2015 as I write this review). It's in a long, narrow space along Rue Stanley, split into two levels. We had made a reservation and we ended up with a perfect table on the edge of the upper level. Our mini-booth overlooked the neon excitement of the lower floor. Our server was an adorable young girl who we ended up chatting with for some time throughout our meal.  We started off with a few cocktails for our evening of celebration. It was my 30th birthday and I knew right from the start that this was a great spot for a birthday celebration. We were in Hawaii several months back and I was reminiscent for a Mai Tai. They serve the Mai Tai in a coconut shell which was kinda cliche but cool. The Mai Tai was nice and slushy with good flavor. You would think there wasn't a drop of liquor in there it went down so easily. Dangerous! For my next drink I kept it simple with a glass of prosecco.   For the appetizer, we opted for the Disco Poutine which looks quite plain when it first came out but then we started stirring. The center and middle of the bowl was loaded with gravy and cheese curd goodness!  On the entree front, I opted for the Tempura Lasagna which our server seemed unsure about. She was concerned that \"it's very fried\" but that I'd like it if I enjoy fried foods. Well I'm from Dallas, the home of the State Fair of Texas and the capitol of fried foods! The lasagna was a thick slab of meat, pasta, and cheesy goodness, battered and fried tempura-style. It actually wasn't over-the-top fried and while not the healthiest dish, it was not as heavy as it sounds. Loved every bite!  We capped off our meal with the bread pudding which was excellent like everything else. We continued the evening chatting with our server and the manager even stopped by. We really wanted a great meal and a fun atmosphere that night and it's exactly what we got. I highly recommend Deville Dinerbar and every bit of neon that comes with it!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of the place, very upbeat... we went on a Saturday night so of course it was busy and packed. We were seated at a booth which was smaller than other booths I've eaten at. Just with one person next to me I barely had any elbow room to eat. The food was quite tasteful. Price wise I believe it should be ranked at $$$... it is a bit pricey.. but I suppose it makes up for it w/ the good portions."}
{"text":"First time eating at Deville. Nice decor. The restaurant is decorated in a 1960s restaurant style. Love it. Aside from the decoration, the service is just fine, nothing really stands out."}
{"text":"The place is a good place to hang with friends. The food was cooked to perfection. Everything was tasty. But I could do without their dessert. Also, remember because of taxes (15%) your bill will add up. So be mindful of that. But overall wish I could open their restaurant in New York. Definitely a place to visit when in Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to place for consistently good food and drinks. From their burgers to their prime rib, always good, hot food. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the place is overpriced. Yes it's good food (not great!) yes the cocktails are good, but $170 for a $71 (retail) bottle of Veuve? There's no excuse for that. It's simply gouging."}
{"text":"Ok, here's deal: the aesthetics of this place make you feel like you're eating at a strip club in the airport, and the prices fit that feeling, but the food is, given all this, surprisingly good. I had the drive-in burger with house smoked bacon and fries for $20, and I have to say it was awesome. The fried chicken and waffles were also good as was the fish burger. This is a good relatively affordable option for the area (we were catching a movie nearby)."}
{"text":"I actually like the food being served in the new age diner but the reason behind the three stars are the prices!! I had to pay nearly 20$ for an appetizer consisting of three tacos...   I have tried so far their tuna tacos (fresh tuna with a nice asian dressing in a crispy shell taco) and a few of their burgers (very very big and rich). The food tastes great, just the way greasy american diner food should taste but the price is easily double or even triple what you find in a diner. I understand the upscale nature of this diner but when a restaurant charges you $20+ for a burger, something's wrong."}
{"text":"Love the trendy decor and neon lights. The atmosphere is comfortable yet chic, a good trendy date spot I'd say.  Service was fast and friendly, and was helpful for recommendations because they have a pretty expansive menu. They had a $40 a la carte deal going on, which gets you a starter, main, and dessert. Seriously worth it, considering the prices of the components. For starters, we got the fried mac and cheese wontons. You only get 3 things of it, which is not a lot at all, judging the price they sell it at. Also it was more like fried perogies, those were defo not wonton wrappers you guys. Delicious nonetheless. I got the ribs for the main, which came with coleslaw and a cornbread muffin. I was super satisfied with this dish, the slaw was delish, the ribs fell off the bone, and I couldn't even finish my fries. (Interesting fries btw, super thin, like chips) And for dessert we got the apple pie. Apples wrapped in pastry with ice cream on top ughhhh you honestly can't go wrong with that.  All in all, the food was delicious and it was a great dining experience, but the prices were too high. Understandable to some degree: (downtown, big restaurant, big menu) but it's not a place you can go to all the time."}
{"text":"Great Cesar salad, awesome sandwiches and great service - no complaints.   I recommend the Duke sandwich - it's kind of like a gourmet breakfast in between 2 buns."}
{"text":"Warning: The portions are HUGE!  Booked a party for 25 here for my friend's bday. The manager was less than accommodating to say the least! It took both my friend and I couple of tries to make the reservation in the end.   1. They do not take reservations between 6-8pm on weekend nights, fine we made one for 8:30pm. 2. We have to wait at the bar for our table, until everyone is here, fine. 8:25pm everyone arrived, and our table is ready but the manager refused to seat us. 8:35pm rolls around and I demanded that we be seated, but the manager had the nerve to say to me: Well no one have had a drink yet, people usually drink at the bar before going to their tables. I shut him up by telling him we are religious.   That being said, the waiters are sweethearts, really friendly and know the menu well. The food is generally tasty, and portions overly generous. No one could finish their side of fries. I had the Chip & dip appetizer, Cirque burger and strawberry milkshake.  We ordered their chocolate cake dessert as a birthday thing for my friend. It came out with a candle, and the cake was HUGE! It was actually enough for maybe 15 people to have a slice each. Definitely worth the $13 bucks."}
{"text":"Trendy Diner, probably the trendiest I've ever been.  Good food  BUT OVERPRICED Service was good However OVERPRICED  If this is a diner, it would be $$$$ stars.  If you have tons of cash to burn, this is your place !"}
{"text":"Everything is just good. nothing mind blowing. Its pretty expensive but some dishes are justified based on portion size. Love the ambiance, kind of wish this was open later and was a dinnerbar"}
{"text":"Very delicious food and the environment was great awesome music .the drinks weren't that great tho"}
{"text":"Had two great meals here. My husband liked it so much that we went back the next day.   First visit - came in at 12 am. They let us be the last table to sit outside. Loved the ambiance out there and our server was fantastic. I only had poutine and a beer, but both were great. I thought we'd be forgotten outside when they were closing but we never lacked for service.  Second visit - next day at 3:30 pm. Always a slow time in restaurants when you'd normally get bad service, but our server was the same as the night before and fantastic. He was always there with a smile, polite, funny and helpful. My calamari was very flavorful and extra crispy.   It's a little expensive and a little cheesy, but overall two great experiences!"}
{"text":"Had dinner and then lunch here the next day. Great atmosphere and the food lives up to the previous reviews. I had the El Sloppy burger and a mango mojito and the taste of the pulled rib in the El sloppy was delicious. While the fries were different and interesting, in my opinion, they were too thin and a little tough to chew and as they were so thin and so many, there was a lot of chewing. But the burgers and the other food were top notch :)"}
{"text":"MMMM! LOBSTER SALAD AVOCADO sandwich! I'm not mentioning the bacon because it's fatty and I had to pick around it. The shoestring fries that came with this incredible sandwich were tastier than they looked, and since there seems to be a derth of median-priced restaurants at palatable prices, I came here twice and got this sandwich (the second time introducing a resident of the city to this place who plans on having her birthday dinner here). I sipped two glasses of happiness-inducing fine rose while my husband slurped on a divine-tasting chocolate shake. (I don't even want to know how may calories are in it, but one sip did me just fine.)    Plus, cool decor, Duran Duran on the speakers, and free wifi!"}
{"text":"Good food, had the calamari, most tender I've ever had. I had the meatloaf, very good. Wife had the regular hamburger be liked it. The bun and sauce was different and a well liked departure from an American burger.   Now the bad thing, the decor, horribly cheesy, 1950s diner kitsch. White black and pink everywhere. Ruins the meal if your trying to eat Canadian food instead of Canadians trying to imitate American food.  Not a $$ restaurant, more items you want to try are in the $$$ range.   Most customers are speaking English, bad sign maybe? Good food, not a good experience if your trying to eat local Canadian food."}
{"text":"Enormous burger... but mostly importantly, tasty.  The tiny shoestring fries were pretty solid too."}
{"text":"Deville Dinerbar was our first stop while visiting Montreal this weekend. We got in late at night and, naturally, we were starving. Deville Dinerbar was one of the places we had mapped out before we left for vacation. Upon entering, you notice the bright pink fluorescent lighting and the cool diner vibe. It's a beautiful restaurant.  I am vegetarian so I try to make sure we can eat at places that can cater to me. I saw that they had a mushroom burger on the menu so I was down for that. We ordered the corn cakes as an appetizer and they were delicious. My mushroom burger came with a side of green beans as requested by myself. My boyfriend got the bourbon-soaked pear and brie burger. The mushroom burger was absolutely amazing. The food was so well seasoned and well made. Everything was delicious and the waiter was super friendly and nice. He even gave us information on places to visit. Merci Deville!"}
{"text":"Not just great food- an amazing experience too. The fishbowls are great and the portions are great for sharing because they are so big. Brought my mum and grandmother here and they loved it just as much as I do."}
{"text":"The food here is above average. I have been there several times and it was more or less to my liking. The duke burger, which is topped with an egg is simply delicious. The salmon plate is not bad, however it is too small as it does not come with much. The apple pie ice cream sandwich is one of my favourite desserts there which is good for two people to share. The shakes are pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was amazing and the atmosphere is fun. I had the lamb the first time and had the General Tao salad this time. I also had the sangria fishbowl as a drink...sooo yummy.   My only thing with this place is the portion sizes - way too big! They must throw out so much food. The General Tao salad was a reasonable price for downtown Montreal but it had over 2 breasts of chicken worth and the salad bowl was the size of a sink. We were 10 ladies having dinner and only 2 finished their plates.  The appetizers are also so big that you cannot order for them alone or else you are too full to eat your meal.  I'll still go back though, everything is super good!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for our last night's stay in Montreal. Overall it was sort of mediocre and hit-or-miss. The service was quick and friendly, but the prices were very high, and the food was so so.  I had a prime rib French dip sandwich with poutine, the au jus was some sort of thick gravy, not what I expected.  The poutine was simply shoestring fries with nacho cheese and gravy slathered over it. Not bad, but not poutine.  My wife ordered better, and had a burger that was delicious. It had pear and caramelized onion on it which was a great combination.  Overall, not a bad place, but there are better options."}
{"text":"In truth MY experience was a 2 - but I'll give the Dinerbar an aspirational 4 now that I know what to order on my next visit. On the positive side the place has great service and atmosphere and decor so sharp you could cut yourself. But...  My principal complaint which the Dinerbar could and should fix is that they have a large menu of mixed drinks...NONE of which cater to those men and whisky babes who like their drinks savory, spicy, and/or bitter. It is truly sad when the least sweet thing on the drink menu is the Margarita. And it wasn't as if there was a massive selection of stouts or porters or IPAs to lead me elsewhere.  And since I was stuck with a Margarita and it was Cinco de Monday (so the tacos were 2 for $5) and the bartender recommended them I went for 2...and then 4. And they were passable...but not actually good in any real sense. Certainly no where near as good as the burgers, poutine, and other dishes I saw being feasted on to my left and right. So I ended up more than full with a drink for $20 after tax and tip - which must be a record for the Dinerbar. But I would never order that way again."}
{"text":"Brilliant food, flawless service, excellent decor, aside from the menus being slightly bulky I can't think of a single complaint. We had a perfectly-cooked salmon for lunch, with a tropical salsa on a vegetable-potato bed. Most delicious lunch I've eaten in a decade or so. For dessert we shared an order of amazing beignet, served with caramel and a nutella mousse. Constant but entirely unobtrusive service, quick delivery of everything. The decor is absolutely perfect for a diner-bar, and a broad variety of music that serves to match. More than a bit of a 1980's vibe, but done such that it bridges 1950's diners to the present."}
{"text":"Deville is a pretty busy place on weekends and Fridays but my boyfriend and I managed to snag a seat despite having no reservation. The place has a nice ambience although we were seated in a dark corner I appreciate the sleek diner decor. We both ordered burgers which were huge and the fries were very nicely cooked as well. The service was pretty darn good; we waited I think less than 10 minutes for both of our meals to come out and took less time than the table next to us who ordered 2 milkshakes for dessert oddly (?) Overall, a pretty nice place if you're craving a juicy burger but expensive for the student budget so if you're wanting to treat yourself; this is the place!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Feta salad was very good.Ingredients we're fresh.Service was a outstanding.Pink neon decor reminds me of the 60s meets the 2000s."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place for special occasions. I already had two of my birthday celebrations here and they never disappoint me. For people who likes seafood or pastas, their Bad Girl Pasta is definitely the one you wanna try! I enjoyed this dish very much every time especially the scallops inside. Servers are always so polite and friendly. Great restaurant for a night out in town!"}
{"text":"Before I give extra details of my experience, let me start out by saying that I definitely have a love-hate relationship with this place. On one hand, I've had positive experiences food-wise all three times I've been here; however, it takes me quite a while to recover from the sticker shock that usually gives a bad blow to my wallet (I usually spend about ~$45 CAD in one sitting), leaving me to carry the weight of guilt on my shoulders caused by poor college student-isis. But, that doesn't mean I don't have anything good to say about it.  There's not really much to be said about the decor that hasn't already been said - it's very swanky, in your face, and makes you feel a little more high-class than your average American diner. Offering some gourmet and \"dressed-up\" versions of American classics as well as international dishes with a twist, Deville at least lives up to their prices to some extent with their large portion sizes that are guaranteed to leave you in a food coma.  For starters, this time I went with the strawberry milkshake and the cornbread cheddar jalapeño muffins.  (Normally I get one of the boozy milkshakes but since it wasn't a Sunday I stayed clear of it in order to not make my pockets go even more RIP). Upon sipping my milkshake, I was pretty sure I was directly transported to Cloud Nine because they really have this lightness about them that I love, and you can actually taste strawberry flavoring and it's not sickeningly sweet. I found the muffins to be extremely filling, and while they tasted good (the butter complimented them nicely), I didn't find them to be anything particularly special, and I was full after eating two despite not having eaten anything else that day. (Side note: the first time I came I split a Philly Cheesesteak Spring Rolls order with a friend and they were AMAZING, but at $16 I didn't want to risk it this time).  I then went with the Porchetta Carbonara, and it came with a poached egg and sheets of Parmesan cheese on top. When I broke the egg, water started oozing out of the egg instead of the yolk and first, and I was slightly weirded out, but it didn't impact the pasta flavor negatively so I just went with it. The pasta's texture went really well with the cream sauce; however, the porchetta seemed slightly out of place in the dish. If it hadn't included the meat, it would have been a perfect dish.  Does Deville Dinerbar live up to its promise of being \"The Next Evolutionary Step in Classic Diners?\" Probably not, considering that although the food is of higher quality as stated before, it's not high enough to completely justify the high prices that are more like $$$ rather than $$. I would rate this time about 3.5/5 overall, although my previous experiences were more like 4/5. If you want to impress your date or have a stylish night out on the town with your group of friends with good food included, then I recommend this place.  *Also shoutout to the waiter who accepted my $100 bill and was able to get change for it after I have been trying to get rid of it forever! :)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while we were in Montreal last week and if you are hungry this is the place to go. It is styled like a hip and busy American style diner, the food is awesome and the portions are gigantic. I had the stuffed meatloaf with mashed potatoes and it was very good with ample amounts of bacon wrapping the meatloaf. Others in my party had ribs, roasted chicken and lamb and were all very happy with their meals. We also had the deville beer which was a good refreshing beer as well. They've got a very diverse menu with burgers, sandwiches, salads, and some more eclectic options, and diner staples like shakes and malts to go along with as well. I highly recommend Deville if you are in Montreal it is top notch food in any city."}
{"text":"This was actually a 3.5 stars, but since this was my first meal in Montreal I am feeling generous and am rounding up. After my friend and I checked in at our hotel, we were feeling hungry so we gave Deville Dinerbar a try. The place is very cool and hip with an innovative menu. It's a diner except every dish has a unique twist to it. The hostess was super sweet and allowed us to choose our table. This place has really cool drinks and places their cocktails in cool cups that look amazing pictures. We ordered a Mojito, a Maithai, a chicken salad, and a cobb salad. The drinks were too sweet so we couldn't finish it. I thought the chicken salad was delicious with the perfect mix of ingredients (avocado, spinach, rotisserie chicken, etc.) The house dressing was delicious too. The service was just okay, but it's okay - we left feeling satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Fun art deco place. Great service and the lamb chops appetizer was amazing! The bartender was very nice and gave us some places to explore while in town."}
{"text":"The pulled lamb pasta and tao salad are amazingly delish! This place has fast service, very friendly waiters, and the food does not disappoint at all!!"}
{"text":"We got here early on a Friday evening, and it was already bustling. A lot of the items on the menu looked good. We ended up sharing the el sloppy Jose burger and the maple-glazed rotisserie chicken. The burger was okay - it was a bit too salty and heavy for me, and I wish there had been some kind of fresh or pickled element to cut through the flavors from the meat and cheese sauce. The fries were great. The chicken dish was a really generous portion, and the standout was the amazing rice that it came with. All in all, a fun spot to get some comfort food."}
{"text":"Je commente pour la première fois sur Yelp, mais j'y suis déjà allé plusieurs fois. Toujours autant agréable d'être assit à une table à cet endroit. Bon accueil, bonne ambiance et personnel très cordiale et souriant. Menu épuré et très bien expliqué. La nourriture est d'une qualité exceptionnelle. Des saveurs riches en bouche et d'une somptuosité à couper le souffle. Les calamars sont excellent, le burger le FatCat est un vrai régal et les beignets sont à couper le souffle. Le service est rapide et efficace. Le rapport qualité prix vaut le déplacement. Par contre, si vous voulez en profiter un soir de fin de semaine, réserver très tôt, puisque l'endroit est populaire et affiche complet rapidement. Globalement, je recommande fortement cet endroit."}
{"text":"Overpriced for less than quality food. Also, I reserved for my sister's birthday we had a table for 10. The manager was extremely rude after making us wait for 10 minutes he said he would not get us seated unless all 10 people showed up in the next 10 minutes. I asked him if we could get a table for the 7 people that were already here and he refused stating (quite condescendingly) once more that he will not seat us unless all 10 people came. Never witnessed such bad service in my life."}
{"text":"Went for my sister's bachelorette party. The drink menu is expansive and there are tons of food options. Our service was great. My sister really enjoyed, especially the Beignets!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in Montreal so far. Deville's take on burgers are definitely not run of the mill. My boyfriend had the inside out, it looked like a reverse flower bloom on a bun, and he loved the taste. A very friendly waitress recommended The Fat Cat burger and she wasn't wrong about the juiciness. I definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the mood for a fun decor and burgers."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! From the appetizers to the dessert the food is terrific. For appetizers we had  the Mac and cheese Wontons, the Disco Poutin, and the Calamari.  For our main course, wehad the Bad Girl pasta, which was succulent. Largest shrimps and scallops I've ever had. Others in our party had the Adam's ribs and the spaghetti and meatballs. All amazing. They saved the best for last. Dessert was unbelievable, the beignet were second only to Cafe Du Monde and the French Toast with Ice Cream was the best dessert ever!   The service was great and the price was very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I was always nervous to eat at this restaurant because of the huge bar as the focal point. However a friend always suggested to have breakfast or lunch here which I finally did.    I love the dark themed restaurant with pink and purple accented colours. The restaurant is very pretty and well kept. Our server was very polite, explained the menu and items very well. The dishes have unique and fun names.   My friends and I had a few appetizers as we were headed for the movies. I had the fried calamari with sauce which I really liked. I also liked the mac & cheese samosas which came with a sauce as well and was quite filling. I had a hard time finishing it. The calamari came with this amazing dipping sauce and I used that for the samosas (which I couldn't finish).   Definitely worth going again to try other food items."}
{"text":"Very hip cross between a diner and a bar, in other words, something only Montreal could dream up. The food seemed overpriced but my lunchtime special burger was one of the best I've ever had. I opted for one less patty for maple smoked bacon. It was delicious. There's a good wine list and lots of cocktails but not much for beer. Service was very good too. I would probably go back for the overpriced burger because it was just that good."}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite restaurants in Montreal!  We have been twice now and ask for Emilie to be our server..  she is awesome and always knows the best items in the place. Thanks for another great experience guys!!  See you next year!!  Must tries: Mac and Cheese wontons, pulled BBQ chicken sandwich, Gaucho steak, hangar steak, pain perdu for dessert"}
{"text":"Le service A1, l'ambiance et decors parfait (musique un peu forte pour certains) en plus notre serveuse etait super gentille et compétente.   En entrée on a partagé le poulet frit avec les gauffres et sirop sucré au babeurre: c'était wow! Sucré salé, quand même léger pour ce que c'est. A prendre à deux ou plus, car c'est énorme. Mon ami a pris les côtes levées excellentes 11/10! Et moi j'ai pris la prise du jour flétan avec risotto: c'était super bon, la cuisson du poisson était parfaite.   Pour dessert, les fameux beignets: je suis pas une fan de timbits, mais sincerement ils valent le detour! Note parfaite pour les beignets.  Points faibles: le prix est correcte pour les portions, mais ils devraient diminuer les portions et en meme temps le prix. Car tu manges pas tout, a moins d'etre un ogre!"}
{"text":"It was really good and the service was really polite and nice. I loved their french fries and their burgers are amazing."}
{"text":"Looked on my trusty yelp for a good place to eat since the previous night's dinner sucked and this place, although a bit on the pricy side, was worth eating at:  Bad girl pasta -  5 stars - this dish was the best of all that we ordered.  This pasta dish had a unique, smooth flavor of pasta sauce that we can't duplicate. The seafood tasted fresh, that included 3 large shrimp, mussels and scallop.  Half rack of ribs - 4 stars - the ribs were very soft, melt in your mouth, and the bbq sauce was strong and sweet.  Deville burger - 4 stars - the burger itself was huge and juicy with lettuce and tomato. Way better than the burger we ate at another restaurant previously. Came with a lot of string fries.   Maple shake - 4 stars  - a huge, very sweet shake with whipped cream on top.  Service - 5 stars - exceptionally great.  Overall, 4 stars because it's very pricy for the type of food we ate."}
{"text":"Nice place trendy. The steak was just awesome. I have never had such a succulent steak even in major steakhouses. What made the night pleasant was Kristine who was very friendly, welcoming and helpful.  All in all nice experience and I would definitely recommend it for dinner.  Ask for Kristine and tell her that she was mentioned on Yelp :)"}
{"text":"visiting Montreal from the U.S., we went to this very hip place.  Has a  contemporary, cool interior design & atmosphere. HUGE portions, especially the sandwiches. we had the ahi tuna taco appetizer - excellent, and turkey club sandwich & a chopped salad. the sandwich was at least 7 inches tall, LOL. you'd need a snakes ability to unhinge your jaw to eat it ;-)  the chopped salad was served as a Tower of veggies, topped with fried onions, and was delicious. prices are a little expensive but it's a big city."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. It's different from burgers I have before and the French fires are unique too. Would recommend if u like burgers."}
{"text":"I come here and eat with my friends every time we come to Montreal. It's a great place for groups. The food is amazing and you share everything with your friends. The onion rings are shocking. I also really love the tuna tacos. Service at this place is always really good! I've gone here at least 4 times and they never let me down.  Very consistent!"}
{"text":"I rate this place 3.5*  Food: believe it or not, I really enjoyed the very American menu (coming from an American). Typical things you'd find in the states. I had the pulled pork sloppy joe and fried pickles and it was really satisfying. The drinks were well mixed and tasty.  Service : once again, they (well, the waitress that served us) had that American customer service flare, very corky and nice. It was appropriate and fun.  Decor : I would describe it as a modern diner - if those two words can even be put together. Very clean and nicely decorated.  CONS : I don't care so much for prices, but must mention that I was charged an extra 2$ for more spicy ketchup. I mean, we ordered two full meals + appetizers + alcohol. I mean really? I just thought it was a really petty thing to do and would suggest the owners to not do that if customers order meals and alcohol. Really petty."}
{"text":"Service 5/5, ambient 5/5, food 5/5. I don't have much to say about this place. I can only say, not to exaggerate, this is probably one of best restaurant I've been.  I love the decors in here. Pink lights, good music. Server was polite and fluent in both English and French. Our food were amazing, good portion, amazing taste. Everything was upscale but affordable.  Will visit again for sure the next time when I hit up Montreal."}
{"text":"My lasting impression of this restaurant is related to the décor and not the actual food that I had. Without a doubt, this restaurant was catered towards 20-40 something females, with neon pink lighting mixed in with chrome details. The drinks come in a variety of \"fun\" containers, such as a carved coconut or intricate glasses. The whole place looks like retro, but not real retro; more like an Andy-Warhol-esque interior designer's definition of it.   The food was pricy but came in abundant quantities. The matchstick fries are the item that stood out, as it is rare to see them house-made.  I had the lunch special, the fish, which came elegantly plated with some vegetables. They seem to have a special theme for the lunch, and the day I went was Swedish. The menu items description oddly sounded like an Ikea menu and so I abstained from that option.  Overall, good food but you are definitely paying for their central downtown location. It's on the pricy side for a student budget, without the wow-factor that would make me comeback for more."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this spot! I stick with what I know and get the General Tao Chicken Salad every time which is possibly the most delicious salad I have ever received in a restaurant. The portions are VERY generous but somehow I can never manage to leave any food on my plate! Great ambiance and decor. I come back every time I'm in Montreal and am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. (Definitely recommend doing lunch instead of a weekend dinner, as it gets incredibly crowded and you undoubtedly need a reservation on a Friday/Saturday evening.) The chicken & waffles appetizer was beyond amazing. The burgers and sandwiches were only average; the unique combinations and toppings were what interested us, but the actual hamburger itself wasn't memorable. Service was great. Would definitely return on next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Good food. Fancy and expensive.Waiters are nice.. and if you have reservation its better if not gotta wait. I like the salad. Its yummy and big serving! Try the salad, the desserts are just normal. Good place for couple, friends catching up, but not for kids.. Environment is fancy."}
{"text":"awesome food and service! it's a bit on the pricey side (the burgers we ordered were $23 each), but they were huge and came with a generous helping of fries so not bad for a night out with friends every once in a while! drinks were $12 each, i believe.  anyway, it was an overall good experience. will definitely be recommending deville to family and friends."}
{"text":"It's overpriced for what you get. I simply can't state it enough. There is an unpublized kids menu, so if you are thinking about bringing the family - know that you have options for your children."}
{"text":". We were three people, so we tried the mini lobster rolls, it was good but not as good as i would imagined, it was a bit bland and it's a bit pricey for an appetizer 21$ it got better on the main dish two of us had the macho deville salad which is very good! The 3rd person took the deville burger and she liked it too. After that, we had the kitty kat and the smores milkshakes and both were very good. The ambiance is nice, pink everywhere and good music! A must try"}
{"text":"Coming from the States, I find it a bit ironic that I'd seek out a place serving American comfort food instead of eating French food, but this was recommended by a local and the dishes sounded delicious. Walking into the place, it reminded me of a futuristic diner, or like a Virgin America plane turned into a diner with pink lighting.  I'd recommend coming with more than 2 people so that you can share a bunch of the appetizers - 4-6 people would probably be ideal. Between my coworker and I, we ordered 5 different appetizers / starters so we could try a little bit of everything. The portions here are generous - American sized, if you will.  Best / Favorite Dishes:  Bacon Wrapped Dog Sliders - Normally, something you'd buy on the street at 2 am after drinking, these are made fancier by turning them into sliders and putting them into toasted brioche buttered buns. They are delicious - I ate 2 out of the 3 of them and wanted more.  Southern Fried Buttermilk Chicken Crispers - As if a belgian waffle and deep fried chicken weren't sinful enough, this is smothered with a maple syrup butter gravy that is both sweet and savory. Perfectly crispy and flavorful, this is some of the best fried chicken & waffles I've had.  Beignets - These were also very delicious, but too much for 2 people to share - there were probably 8 or 9 of them. They were fresh and hot, and not overly fluffy like a donut hole, but not terribly dense either. Just right, dusted with powdered sugar and served with a chocolate mousse and honey dipping sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Just Ok:  Fried Pickles - Good, but too much for 2 people. They were not necessarily mind-blowing, but not bad either.  Ahi Tuna Tacos - I wanted to like these more, but the size of them were a little too big and hard to eat. The pieces of tuna were decently sized, and good, but there was too much of the won-ton shell and coleslaw that you weren't really able to get everything proportionally in one bite.  Pass:  Mini Lobster Rolls - I normally love lobster rolls, but this had too much mayo, and not enough big chunks of lobster dipped in butter.  All in all, very inventive dishes. Definitely not a place to go to if you're on a diet. Don't come here and order a salad - go big or go home, and pick a bunch of not-so-good-for -appetizers to share with a large group of friends. You will feel stuffed when you leave, and you may have eaten half a stick of butter and lots of deep fried food, but it will satisfy your \"comfort food\" tooth for a while. I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Love the food. Abi tuna taco is soooo good! The bad girl paste is really large with giant scallop and shrimp. Yummy! Service is very nice too. Will miss the taco a lot ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place. A very unique restaurant with a super cool ambiance. The server speaks English and French. It is located in downtown Montreal.   I had the burger and the meat was juicy and it's antibiotic beef patty. The patty is amazing!!!! The French fries were amazing. They were very unique and thin.   The shack was amazing and creamy. I loved it so much.   All in all, i love this place. Would defiantly come again !!!! :)"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience! Food was amazing. We had the Bad girl pasta and beignets! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant during our stay in Montreal which is the sister to Reuben's, also in the same vicinity. This new place must have just gone in recently because it was not here when we visited over a year ago. Overall the vibe of this place is definitely a bit hipster meets 1950's diner (chrome and all). There was a little bit of a wait when we got there but we didn't mind at all. We were seated in probably 10 minutes or so which was quicker than we expected. Our waiter was awesome and when asked, even informed us of the \"best\" choices on the menu. From what I could see, much of the menu consisted of sandwiches, expensive steaks, a few fish choices, burgers, and salads.   First my fiance and I ordered the \"wontons filled with macaroni\" which were awesome. Very cheesy and came with a marinara dip on the side which I didn't use much. I ended up ordering the \"hot pulled chicken sandwich\" which personally, I thought was blegh. For being a \"hot\" sandwich, it wasn't hot at all. There was also a good portion of dark meat in the sandwich that I didn't eat (not a dark meat fan). My fiance ordered the \"brisket sandwich\" which he said was amazing and ate completely. Besides our food, we both got mixed drinks that I thought were a bit overpriced ($11+ a piece). Mine in particular tasted very syrupy and left a coating of sugar on my teeth. This is mainly why I don't drink mixed drinks that often anymore.  So overall I would say this place is neat and has a vibe all on it's own. I'm mainly giving this place 4 stars for the service, wonton appetizers, and decor. My food wasn't really the best and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Maybe if we visit this place again in the future, I might have a different experience with the main course."}
{"text":"The only reason I even gave 1 star is because the atmosphere was really cool at this place. Unfortunately, everything else missed the mark.   This place is an overpriced tourist trap. The poutine wasn't horrible, but clearly frozen French fries and gravy out of a packet. For the main course, I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf, which the server recommended. Boy was she wrong. Can you say SALT much?! I couldn't even finish half of it because it was so salty, which I mentioned to the server. The manager came over to rectify the situation, which I was grateful for, however he proceeded to send MORE crap out to us instead of taking the meatloaf off of the bill.   When I got the check - meatloaf and \"free\" dessert were still on the bill. At that point I just wanted out.   Don't waste your time or money. There is a great place down the road called Dominion Square Tavern, go there instead."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Deville Dinerbar. The location is convenient to downtown Montreal stores and hotels. The atmosphere is upscale, trendy and fun. The servers are really friendly and helpful. The drinks are plentiful. The food is even more.  The restaurant features some of the foods we like best, and especially comfort foods, in a more upscale and innovative way that did not just tantalize the eyes or impress me with the inventiveness but in a way that was wholly satisfying. After a lot of deliberation over the menu, where everything from fried chicken to grilled salmon sounded perfect, I chose the General Tso salad. The salad came in a very large bowl of spinach or greens and with toppings typical of a Chinese chicken salad at most any restaurant -- expect it was topped with ginormous chunks of freshly breaded General Tso chicken. The chicken was moist and served in large portions, but not overly glazed in sugary sauce or grease. My friend also enjoyed another salad that was loaded with healthy fruits, nuts and vegetables. My mint cocktail also was excellent.  What a great place with a fun vibe and good food. A must in Montreal."}
{"text":"Poutine and Jalepeno Cornbread is ! LOVED IT!  We ordered the Fish N Chips and Gus Salad and it was very good as well! Probably the best food that we had I Montréal! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Great location downtown with a nice patio in the summer. They have great salads, sides and main courses. Unfortunately they've made some menu changes and taken off some great items that i used to go there specifically for. However it's still a nice large and diverse menu with something for everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks! Best Old Fashion! Packed around dinner time, we sat at the bar and had a great time! Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"The diner-like experience is the only thing that you'll get from this place. The food and drinks are so-so, and pretty pricy for what you're getting. Our waiter was awesome but the hostess/head waitress was kicking us out of our table, and we were still ordering drinks. Not really impressed..."}
{"text":"My first time in Montreal and DeVille Dinerbar was recommended to me and I must say, it is a winner! Great atmosphere. Excellent and friendly service. And the food was awesome! We started with the crispy mac and cheese stuffed wontons with a side of Diablo marinara sauce. They were perfect. The sauce has just enough of a kick to make it stand out from your average marinara. And the mac and cheese in the wontons was as close as you can get to Southern Comfort Food in Canada. I had the Bacon Weaved Meat Loaf which is a combination of Veal, Pork and Beef in a Bacon Weaved Wrap Stuffed with Quebec Aged Cheddar and Oven Roasted. With Mashed Potatoes and Truffled Mushroom Ragu. Probably the best meatloaf I've ever had and that mushroom ragu is killer. My friend had the Bad Girl Pasta which is fresh Mussels, Diver Scallops, Baby Clams & Black Tiger Shrimp, Sautéed in a Chiptole Lobster Bisque with Linguini Egg Pasta. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Plate went back clean. We sat on the outside terrace but we would've been fine inside too. The décor is funky and pink. Not a cheap break but will worth the cost. I highly recommend a stop if you live there or if your visiting. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow. Deville was pure bliss and definitely worth all the hype!  Decor/ambiance: Super cute with a 1950s Grease meets pop art style.  Cute menu with interesting names and a retro look/feel   Drinks: A number of interesting cocktails in the quite heavy cocktail menu.  I ended up ordering a French 75 because I was just in the mood   Appetizer: We ordered the poutine (Deville Poutine?), it wasn't very memorable.  I'm not a fan of poutine (there I said it!).    Burger: Let's skip to the good stuff.  I ordered the cirque burger which had the brie, the pears, a thick juicy double layer of burger meat, and I was feeling like a million dollars.  The burger tasted divine and my taste buds were in satisfaction and heaven. Highly recommend it.   Check: Best part of Canada is that we can split a check between 20 girls by paying individually (I LOVE IT)  Misc: My waiter was cute and attentive, so I approve of the service too :)"}
{"text":"Bad girl pasta?????????????35?+ ???????????????!!!!???????????Waiters are charming!!   ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The restaurant definitely has a comic book vibe, from the menu design to the loud music. I had a Lobster BLTA, a hamburger looking sandwich with thin French fries. With that I had a Canadian Amber. Large portions. A little bit hectic for my taste."}
{"text":"In town for a girls weekend and this was a fun restaurant to go too.  They had an interesting and inventive drink menu.  Inspired apps, the fried pickles deserve special shoutout.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Finally the burger was top quality and super juicy.  A little expensive for a diner but well worth it.  Would totally go back again!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife traveled to Canada this winter and the Deville Dinerbar was a must see, must eat destination while visiting Montreal. This restaurant was very nice the ambiance was great. It was packed like a club which made us feel like we were locals. The service was really good and we really enjoyed the food. The portions were fare and the price was reasonable. After enjoying the meal we felt it was only right to try the desserts. I ordered lobster rolls and my wife enjoyed the Lamb with vegetables that was cooked to perfection. Dinner was excellent. I will definitely revisit this restaurant when I come back to Montreal. My suggestion If you ever visit Montreal (You Gotta Eat Here)"}
{"text":"The decoration and menu look fun. As appetizer, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Taco as... but sadly the Tuna is not fresh... very disappointment. The bad girl pasta is ok. The neptune ahi tuna salad is very watery, The tuna is not fresh, I am sure they are not immediately made... a lot of onion... very disappointed too. I find them pricy for the quality of foods."}
{"text":"Stopped by randomly with my husband,  and we found the best ahi tacos.  We've never tasted like that tasty tacos.  We just traveled in Montreal 2days at that time so we ordered twice in that night.   We recommended everyone to have it at least one.  Plus,  the waiter was super friendly."}
{"text":"Flavourful and fun!  This place has some of the most creative and unique diner dishes you will come across.  The burgers were so interesting and so damn delicious!  They also have spiked milked shakes which is a great idea.  Really worth checking out.  Great service too."}
{"text":"DeVille... what a cool place. Chrome, black, pink, decor, 50's swagger, great lighting. Just a really really cool place to go and enjoy a delicious dinner.   The first thing you notice, besides the very friendly hostess, is the vibe. Just inviting, \"glad you're here\" kinda thing. The menu, while based upon American fare, always has a twist. The names are great, the portions sizes are definitely first world problems to attend to; Huge. I've been on business travel, so comfort food hits the spot. And on their menu, which is loaded with comfort food, was a big ole plate of spaghetti and meatballs. Let me tell you, those balls of meat nearly made me explode. Huge, tasty, filling.... Aaaannndddd that could be a review for someone else in a different part of town...   I joke, but the spaghetti and meatballs was so comforting, I nearly needed to be rolled out; and when I got back to my room, nothing but a euphoric carb crash. As for the rest of the menu, it has a little bit of everything. You cannot possibly go wrong.   The wait staff are exceptional. They put up with a table full of 8 very type A management consultants, who'd just put in a 12 hour day. Fortunately, we thought we were hysterical and fun. I'm happy to say, so did the staff.   The only complaint I have, that keeps this from being a 5th star is that it was just so crowded. Not a fault of the establishment by any means. It is a good problem to have, because I will go back there every time I am back in Montreal. Which looks like at least once a week for the next 3 months. Even though the place was packed, the wait staff were on the ball. No one in my party waited or went wanting for anything for long at all.   The crowd was a solid mix of millennial's to people in their late 40's, early 50's. All co-habitating peacefully without clashing. :-)   Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Always my \"go to\" place. Lots of great food. One of my favs is the tuna salad as well as their burgers. SOOO yummy. I also really love their onion ring entree ( more than enough for 2) as well as their beignets for dessert (also enough for 2) are DELISH.  Their drinks are a bit pricey but are very good as well especially if you go there on the right night of the week where their nightly deal happens to be on your drink of voice ! Definitely would recommend for not only the food but the over all experience and ambience."}
{"text":"Glad to say that this place is not all style. It's got substance too! Been here twice and each time was memorable.   The first time was the ribs with the biscuit: yum. The second was the schnitzel and those weird, but delicious, grits like things. Equally good.   This is a cool, hip, and modern resto that is totally pretentious and that's ok. They're allowed to serve their drinks in fishbowls and put Cadbury cream eggs in their donuts.   I want to hate this place, but I can't."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés un mardi soir, et c'était rempli! Ça vous donne une idée de la réputation du restaurant ! L'ambiance est vraiment adapté au style \"dinerbar\" et on se sent un peu comme dans Grease (tsé la scène du diner...)   Nous y mangeons également très bien! Les repas sont GASTRONOMIQUES!! Si tu veux mon humble avis, pour deux personnes, une entrée à partager et un plat, c'est ben en masse! On a goûté aux Dumplings de macaroni ; trop trop bon! et au chicken frit sur gaufres ; WOW ! Délicieux !! Comme repas, mon copain a commandé les ribs (définitivement délicieuses) et j'ai pris les bad girl pasta qui étaient toutes aussi bonnes !!   Nous avons vraiment été charmés par l'endroit et c'est vraiment conseillé d'y aller en gang! Le seul petit hic, les prix sont dispendieux pour ce qu'on y mange!! Aussi, il faut aimer les goûts sucrés parce que tous nos plats avaient une p'tite touche sucrée (cocktail y compris)"}
{"text":"Amahhhzing.  The atmosphere is a lot of fun, hip and the neatest part is if you have an iphone you can choose the music you are listening to! So download the app and get to it!  The food was excellent. A local friend brought me here and we dined on sweet fried pickles (I've only ever had dill!), calamari, Texas brisket sandwich and beignet for dessert.  Omg.   So as I said, I've only ever had fried dill pickles which are yummy but the sweet were such a pleasant surprise! Love it. The calamari was super crisp and yummy and came with awesome dipping sauce (as did the pickles). The Brisket was huge. We split this between two of us and it was plenty, with thin fries and the dessert. Get the beignet. Normally I wouldn't go for something like this, but you HAVE to. They take a little longer to prepare, but itts soooo worth it along with the caramel and the chocolate dips. I want them. Bad."}
{"text":"I wish i had 5 stomachs so i could order all the things! Got the ahi tuna tacos - best everrrrr! Visiting from Vancouver and i wish i could come all the time."}
{"text":"This is a funky little spot we ate at before a Canadiens game. The cocktails are expensive and just kind of ok however the food is creative and very very good. The ahi tuna salad was fabulous and we had fried pickles that had two creative and very delicious dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Deville Dinerbar is not a diner. The crazy leather pink seats are probably the only thing that seem diner like in this place. They had a pretty extensive menu and as a party of 4, we decided to order some drinks and share a bunch of appetizers.   By no fault of Deville Dinerbar, Quebec has a strange law that requires you to order entrees if you are drinking alcohol. So even though we wanted to order a bunch of apps and share everything, we had to order specific apps that would qualify as \"enough\" food for an entree. So strange. Being from NJ I have never heard of such a thing but we went with it and the experience was still really great.   We had the Philly Cheesesteak spring rolls, mac and cheese won tons, soul lettuce wraps, calamari, and the pasta with pulled lamb. All tasted fresh and had a great amount of flavor. We also shared the fried french toast dessert which was awesome.   Everyone also seemed to really enjoy the cocktails. I had the specialty mojito for $12.  Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a laid back dinner with friends."}
{"text":"The venue is very original with a unique and beautiful interior design. Food is great but not always(i do not recommend the lasagna), portions are really big relative to their prices."}
{"text":"This place is nice. Food is always presented beautifully, in the summer they have outdoor sitting on the patio inside the block. It feels like you are away from the city but you are right in the heart of it. Great place!  Not many gluten free options, but you can order salad and they will work with you.   Great to come with friends for drinks!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte dans le centre-veille. Le service était remarquable. J'ai adoré l'ambiance branchée. Oui, la musique est un peu forte, mais elle était bonne. La nourriture ne m'a pas déçu. Les portions sont généreuses. Conseil: si vous songez prendre un dessert, il ne faut pas prendre d'entrée. Encore une fois, je me suis régalé des côtes levées, sans mot..."}
{"text":"This place reminds of a sexier version of the diner in Pulp Fiction, minus the impersonators. It's a wacky take on American diners. The food is definitely continental fusion, they mix everything with everything, it's pretty cool.  We had the Philly Cheesesteak spring rolls, mac and cheese won tons, soul lettuce wraps, calamari, and the pasta with pulled lamb. All tasted fresh and had a great amount of flavor. We also shared the fried french toast dessert which was awesome. The cocktails were creative and delicious. Some of the stuff was on the expensive side, but you're paying for a really unique ambiance too.  Worth trying"}
{"text":"Their fries are amazing but their poutine has a gravy sauce that is a little too salty for my taste. Their ribs and mashed potatoes are also very good."}
{"text":"Love the back patio area!! Service is fast, food is yummy, cocktails taste delicious, and they play some great music.  We tried: -Ahi tuna tacos ($21): HUGE slices of ahi tuna given in 3 tacos.  This is honestly enough for 1 person's meal.  The first taco I had was seasoned perfectly, but the other 2 were overly sweet.  Comes with some amaaaazing sauce on the side. Make sure to smother your taco with it! -Maple glazed rotisserie chicken: this was good but such a huge, huge portion. They gave me half a chicken that I couldn't even finish.  I asked for mashed potatoes instead of the poblano rice and was not disappointed. The mashed potatoes are delicious (and again - huge portion)! -Bad girl pasta: shrimp, scallops, and clams (?) tossed in pasta with a lobster bisque sauce.. SO, SO GOOD. There's a reason this is their most popular dish. Definitely recommend.  The portions are huge, so two people could really split 1 appetizer and 1 entree... or you'd be full off just 1 appetizer alone!  Only other thing worth noting: the bf and I woke up feeling slightly dizzy the next day after indulging in only 1 cocktail (gummy bears on the beach for me, some mojito for him) Usually this happens when we drink cheap liquor, so keep in mind they use cheap liquor for their cocktails."}
{"text":"So whenever I'm in Montreal I love to take a visit to this place! It is in downtown Montreal, center of a main campus and it is always fun and very upbeat space. Always a young crowd and Both times I have been I usually go for one of the colorful cocktails and the Southern Fried Chicken Salad which is UH-MAZING! The salad comes with fried buttermilk chicken bites and mixed greens with tons of veggies and shredded Monterrey jack and cheddar cheese and sweet waffle croutons (SO GOOD) in a pear dressing with a bourbon flavor. Like how amazing?!   Really good place for lunch with friends, super casual and there is an outdoors!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for the weekend and decided to try Deville Dinerbar because of the great yelp reviews, proximity to our hotel, and variety of the menu.   I really enjoyed this place very much. I had the Ahi Tuna Tacos and an order of Mac & Cheese. The Ahi Tuna Tacos were out of this world, just enough dressing, nice crispy shells, and plenty of fresh ahi tuna. The Mac & Cheese however left something to be desired, to me it was just too much cheese for the amount of mac, and a weird mix of cheeses.  Our waiter suggested a great beer, my husband had a special of rib eye with dungeness crab over polenta, which he really enjoyed.  We finished our meal with an order of Pain Perdu, which was just delicious!  I would definitely come here again if I'm back in town."}
{"text":"meh ive experienced better. we ordered the jalapeno cake, which tasted just like cornbread (plain) with a couple pieces of jalapeno with no jalapeno flavour, do not order this, its not good unless you like just corn bread. We ordered their baked macaroni and cheese, which was decent, comfort food, wanted comfort food that day so it sort of hit the spot. It was small, not big. We got the fried pickles, which was probably the best thing even though it wasnt the best. the pickles need to be more thick cause it tasted just like the deep fried breaded stuff. We ordered the lobster rolls, and they were bland, did not like them and would not order them again. We then got the beef ribs rack with coleslaw, coleslaw had too many carrots in them and was tasteless, beef ribs were really sweet, almost like honey. we had a lot of leftovers that day cause the food was not good. probably would not come back to this place."}
{"text":"quite expensive but not delicious. I have the meat loaf and chocolate cake. The serving size were huge, but they was just fat and sugar. I felt quite uncomfortable after eating so much calories while they were not tasty at all. The service and environment was good."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are absolutely huge--making the place worth the money! I got the carbonera pasta and it was delicious with the pieces of meat and poached egg! The daily drink specials are great!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Went for dinner on a Tuesday night. We were able to get in fine but it was fairly busy. Loved our waiter Jim. Ordered Adam's ribs and Bad girl pasta. Both were great but the Bad Girl Pasta was outstanding. Drinks were fairly pricey. Great service."}
{"text":"This is another random lunch place that my boyfriend and I decided to try. It had decent reviews on Yelp and the price point was right up our alley after a couple nights of expensive dinners.  We both ordered the burger and fries. As we were waiting for our food, I was starting to regret not ordering a salad. So many tables around us ordered salads and they looked so fresh! However, when our burgers + fries came, I was not disappointed at all. The burger was juicy and the fries were definitely the star of the dish. They're my favourite type of fries (shoestring) and they were perfectly crispy. It was so good we ditched parts of our burger just to finish the fries.  I recommend this restaurant to people who are around this area and looking for reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"One word ... My favourite place in Montreal !!! The food is  just amazing ! The ambience, music, staff .. Everything is awesome !  Great place for a girls night out !!!!  I recommend 100% Cesar salad is amazing !!! Coconut onion rings are  & all the rest of the menu!  Must try !! The only  is the cost of the drinks ... A little expensive .. But shakes are great 2.   So if u are visiting my beautiful city of Montreal this places is fantastic"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour dîner et l'ambiance est très hot , le staff très accueillant et sympathique. J'ai mangé le club sandwich , très bien fait par contre ça ne vaut pas 18$ et les frites étaient beaucoup trop salées . On a servi à mon ami un fond de baril de bière et c'était beaucoup trop flat . J'y retournerais sans hésitation pour un verre mais pas pour la nourriture ."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out my first night in Montreal.  It's an interesting place.  A lot of neon and chrome a la your classic diner vibe, but multiple levels and vintage brick walls.  A little quirky initially, but in a good way.  A quick look at the menu, and the food is definitely more upscale than diner food.  I opted for the Braised Lamb Shank, which was a good choice.  The presentation was nice, and everything was piping hot.  The Lamb Shank was fall off the bone tender and pretty tender.  Combined with the mashed potatoes and veggies, and it was a perfect sized meal.  Overall the atmosphere was on the hip diner side, while the food was upscale. An interesting combo that worked for me.  I'd eat there again if I am back in town."}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday on a Saturday night. We were all seated on the second floor. Let's start with the negative so we can get it out of the way. The tables are bit small and we all felt very crammed into each other. Menu's are bulky and difficult to manage when you are so close to the person next to you. It is also more difficult when in winter and everybody has coats. I would recommend give more space to customers.  Now let's get to the better part of the review, we were in total 11 people, we were quickly greeting by our waiter that gave some recommendations. He came by at least twice to see if we had any questions about the menu.  What I was most impressed about was the timing, they brought our drinks and about 10 minutes brought our appetizers once all appetizers were done they waited 15 minutes and brought all plates and the same time, so we could all eat at the same time, which I really appreciated.  Az an appetizer I shared the calmari which was very good and specially liked the spicy sauce it had a good kick. I ordered the deville burger, which I really enjoyed, juice, nicely seasoned with wonderful condiments. The bun was so good and the fries were to die for. Everybody loved their food, from the salads to the meatloaf.  At the end we ordered their fabulous beignets which came with two sides, chocolate and caramel sauce. Fluffy inside and a nice crust on the outside. Also the drinks were really yummy, I had the fish bowl sangria which was so huge, but also one of the best sangria's I ever had.  Deville Dinerbar is a great place for a group event, or a girls/boys night out. Very noisy and busy place, so if you are planning for a quiet romantic evening, this place is not for you.  A huge thanks to our waiter, who was well informed, patient, and funny."}
{"text":"My husband and I have Deville another try and it was STUPENDOUS.    We ordered the Fried Chicken Salad. LOVED the dressing. I'm craving it again as I'm writing this review! Also, ordered the Ribeye. It was cooked to perfection. Love the jalapeños that comes with it. Jalapeños are rare in Montréal. As Texans, we loved the surprise. We finished with beignets! It was the perfect thing to tie our evening together. Will return again! :)"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately for our reservation , out waiter Tolle\" approached us and took our order he was well informed and friendly . We ordered the fried pickles for our appetizer , they were great.. Our entrees were the bacon meatloaf and Mac and cheese with short ribs . Both were excellent . We forced ourselves to have coffee and dessert . The banana creme pie was on of the best desserts I ever had. We are foodies and love to experience new things . We give 5 stars all around !!"}
{"text":"Deville Dinerbar's on my go-to list every time I visit Montréal, a diner-meets-cool, casual cocktail bar concept where the food is consistently good and the staff is quite friendly and welcoming. Like any good diner, Deville's menu is huge (français à l'avant, English in the back), offering a variety of burgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta dishes, and a variety of desserts and shakes (yes, boozy ones, too).  My go-to burger here is the Deville: two beef patties with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickle chips, and their signature sauce, all stacked onto a very fresh, lightly grilled brioche bun that holds up to all that wonderfulness to the very last bite. The burgers are a blend of aged beef brisket, chuck, and short rib, a great combination that's absolutely delicious! The blend is what makes this burger special, a much better 'steak burger' than the ones served up by places like The Palm. The burger is accompanied by matchstick fries, and I appreciate that they're served in a small metal bowl - matchstick fries tend to lose their heat quickly, but the metal bowl help keeps them hot longer.  Deville is right down the block from the Peel Metro station and a short walk from the Musée des beaux-arts on Sherbrooke. It's a perfect place for a low-key lunch when you're out and about exploring Centre-Ville, with something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Wow. My fiance, soon to be brother-in-law, and I did not expect this place to blow us away or even leave a single lasting impression like it did last night! We came for a late dinner (we really overate our share of poutine in the afternoon) planning to only get 1 appetizer, 1 salad, and 1 dessert to share. We arrived around 9:30PM and this place was still jammed packed. We didn't have to wait long however (only about 5 mins) and they had a table on the second floor ready for us. As we were situated into our seats, I noticed this place had a nice mix of patrons  (couples on dates, group of girls getting ready for a night out, family with kids, bros just bro-ing it up).   We were soon greeted by our amazing server (Sam). He was spot on from start to finish. He was quick to answer any questions we have with the menu and great in explaining all the specials + signature dishes. My soon brother in law has literally zero spice tolerance and Sam ensured his lasagna Diablo would not be a problem. In addition to the lasagna, we also went with their ahi tuna tacos (their most popular appetizer), Neptune tuna salad (I thought my body needed some green), and Big Easy beignets.   On the menu, the beignets was listed as requiring about 30 mins to make. Sam personally went to the kitchen to check how busy it was, spoke to the chef, and let us know that they would only take about 20 mins at that time. When he served our tacos, salad, and lasagna, Sam remembered our beignets and asked if we would like them to be made now or wait until we were well into our entrees first. I thought it was so nice of him to checked on us and asked for our personal preferences. Our glasses were never empty (I think he personally came by to fill our water at least 6 times) and he asked and talked a little bit more about each of the dishes we ordered.   The lasagna was unique with its crunchy fried battered exterior on top of a bed of fresh tomato marinara sauce. It was literally the size of my fiance's forearm! The taco had a nice sweetness in the center and a generous serving of ahi tuna in each. The Neptune tuna salad was the size of my head. Perfect texture with the edamame, hard boiled egg, cherry tomato, and crunchy green/cabbage. Initially we thought we didn't order enough food for the three of us - but thank goodness I stopped my fiance from ordering another entree.   We were beyond stuffed before our beignets. But we thought - a few petite sized French donuts - totally manageable - until we saw the Chinese take out box they came in. 8 fist sized beignet  - perfectly coated with a light dust of powder sugar, crunchy on the outside with steam flowing out with every bite, and angel soft slightly gooey/melt in my mouth taste of heaven on the inside. They were served with house made caramel sauce and chocolate mousse. The mousse was nothing I've ever tasted before. This itself can be a signature dessert on its own. After I polished my beignets, I ate spoonful of the leftover mousse.  So light, so airy, can I just have a tub of this to go?   The service was equivalent to a fine dining restaurant with at least 2 busboys + 1 main server. We must have left about 30% tip and it was worth every cent. The food yes is a bit expensive but the quality and quantity made it well worth it! The three of us couldn't help but leave this place with the biggest smile. Even though we way overate, there was not a single regret. Forget duck in a can or all the foie gras madness, Deville is a must eat for all the locals and visitors!"}
{"text":"One moment I'm strolling in the action packed hustle and bustle of downtown Montreal, the next I find myself  in....actually I'm not sure what this is. It's an old school diner, yet it's modern; Deville resembles a future-fied diner. It's basically like something out of the jetsons(so sad I'm old enough to know what the jetsons are).   The menu reads more like a short novel, of course not to the level of a Cheesecake Factory(that's more like the food encyclopedia), but lengthy nonetheless and full of fun and creative options.   Ahi tuna tacos: is anything not good in taco form? The tuna is fresh and perfectly rare. The sauce served on the side is phenomenal. With three to an order, these can probably serve as a main dish rather than an appetizer. These tacos are loaded and pack a ton of flavor. I do mean literally loaded, so much so that it's bound to explode in your hand after one bite. You've been warned....an inevitable delicious mess.   Mac and cheese wontons: yes, you read that correctly. Another entree sized meal disguised as an appetizer with five to an order! This concept doesn't even really make sense and honestly shouldn't work, but oh does it work. Creamy Mac and cheese somehow neatly nestled in a fried dough pocket, not at all greasy and pretty satisfying on its own. The kicker? The marinara dipping sauce, perfect pairing. Again, this shouldn't work! This isn't a mozzarella stick, why marinara?! This is clearly the work of an evil genius.....  It is fair to note that Deville may be a little pricey for a quick bite(closer to $$$ than $$), but they do have a verity of lunch special options for the budget minded."}
{"text":"Visiting in the Summer 2016 I recall finding this place a bit by accident. We were shopping in downtown Montreal then the skies decided to open up and rain down upon us so we were like oh quick.. a diner.. that will do for lunch! But it turned out be a bit more \"elevated\" than the diners we are used to back in the States. I came in feeling under dressed seeing other business types around, but still was comfortable - it wasn't an issue.  We started off with some delicious and beautiful looking trio of mini-lobster rolls. They were really tasty and generously filled with hunks of lobster meat. For our mains we went with Deville Nacho salad which was really fresh and the rotisserie chicken was some of the most juicy & tender I ever tried. We also did the Blue cheese Iceberg that was also very good.  Our first visit was a 5 star surprise - excellent food and service across the board. So much so that we decided to go back a second time later that week when we found ourselves in the area and hungry. That visit was not too memorable. The burger I ordered was way overcooked - \"well done\" and a bit on the dry side. I don't remember what else we ordered - perhaps I blocked out this experience preferring to remember Deville in the best possible light of our first meeting!  UPDATE 1/5/17:  As you can see from Annie N, Business Manager's comment to my review they take much care and attention to detail with their restaurant! I am sure they would have corrected the issue I had on my second visit, but I am not one to send food back and waste it (unless its a serious issue such as being raw or spoiled). Deville is great spot that I recommend when in Downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a cut above the rest. The retro, chic decor combines the American Diner style of the 50's along with a sleek, modern edge. I've been here twice and truly enjoyed my dining experiences. They have a varied drink selection that can accommodate all tastes...just ask for little ice cause they do go overboard with it. On my first visit I ordered a Sweet Craig...Vodka, Chambord, Amaretto and lime/lemon soda...it was FANTASTIC!!  As for the meal, my friends and I decided to share a bunch of appetizers. We ordered: the mini lobster rolls, Philly cheesesteak spring rolls, calamari and fries. Everything was really fresh and super tasty. I must add that the staff is very friendly, helpful and they smile! For dessert we chose The Big Easy Beignets--new orleans style donuts, they come with a caramel praline sauce and a chocolate Bourbon sauce....SOOOO GOOD!!!!  On my second visit, my husband and I ordered: the bacon wrapped dog sliders appetizer, if you're a fan of hot-dogs you'll love these. For our main meal, I ordered the pastichio-Greek style lasagna, and my husband ordered the Fat Cat burger. I loved my pastichio, it was a big portion so I got to take the rest with me. My husband on the other hand was not impressed with his burger, the waiter failed to ask him how he wanted his burger cooked....and being that my husband is well traveled and has eaten in great restaurants all over the US--that was a big fail for him. A waiter must always ask how one wants his meat cooked!  For dessert we ordered the 5 & dime malt shake and the Big Easy beignets along with tea/coffee. The desserts were great and we could've used another shake!! Also, they offer a connection to the restaurant's music app...sort of like a personalized jukebox where you can request songs from your iPhone. However, we weren't able to connect to their server to select music. When we asked the hostess, she said she wasn't sure and asked her manager, who basically ignored the request, and said there was nothing wrong with their server. Why advertise this option on your placemat menus, which are sitting on every table, and then not make the service available to your customers!? I should add that my husband is an executive at a well known American computer company, and thus would know if their server had a problem! Besides the insignificant glitches the overall experience at this restaurant was very good, and I must reinstate the fact that the service was EXCELLENT!!! A definite do!!!"}
{"text":"Another chi-chi burger place, another disappointment.  What's a burger? It's a patty, its cheese and a bun. I don't need 2, 3 sauces, caramelized onions and short rib and both sesame AND poppy seeds. Can we PLEASE keep it simple and also... do all burger places have to make horrendously huge frakking burgers?  DO NOT call it Philly cheesesteak. 1, Cheesesteak is only made in Philly, you can drop that part. Plus it's made from rib steak, not shoulder. If yer gonna wit' whiz it, at least use Cheeze Whiz, not a copy brand. But as a beef and cheese spring roll, it work pretty good.  I could go into details, but I'm not up to it.  They made a tasty Tom Collins though. And the lemon pie was awesome."}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying: PROS: - The staff was very lovely and friendly, and took the time to welcome you and cover the menu  - The food was very good: the Maple Glazed Rotisserie Chicken was very tender, moist, plentiful and did show the maple glaze, with a rice that had just the right amount of heat from the poblanos. And the beignets, while not as great as the ones in New Orleans, were a nice touch, with caramel and Nutella dips.   CONS: - The decor, as many have said, is, well, interesting - a kind of 80s chic diner, with lots of metal.  Good music on the background does help keep the place fun. - The fountain sodas DO NOT come with free refill (although I can't remember for the life of me seeing a note about that either on their website or on the menu, so it caught me by surprise a little)  WORST PART OF ALL: The main reason, though, for my low rating is that, despite what Yelp says, this place should not be considered wheelchair accessible.    If anyone who's in a wheelchair and could not move out of it came to the restaurant, they'd not be able to sit anywhere.    While the entrance to the restaurant is (awkwardly) accessible, none of the tables are for someone who couldn't move out of their wheelchair.  The place is divided into (two, I believe) levels.  The first floor has high bar stools, and only 5 booths - which themselves are elevated.  The second floor has many more tables and booths but, being up a few steps - becomes completely unaccessible.  So I showed up to dinner at 8:05 p.m.  All five booths on the bottom floor were taken.  So while there were plenty of seats upstairs, I had to wait for one of the five booths downstairs to open.  And maybe I was just unlucky or whatnot, but it took 45 minutes for one to vacate.  (Many people were finishing their dinners, paying, and still staying to chit chat.)  I can't, of course, blame the guests for sticking around in their booths once they're done eating, to chat a little more (I'm sure I've done the same).  Nor can I require the restaurant to keep a booth open at all times for disabled patrons.  But it'd have been nice to have had a heads-up that the restaurant is just slightly accessible, instead of what Yelp seems to say, and that this situation could happen.  By the time I realized what was going on - how long the wait would be - it was too late to consider going elsewhere.  And it just became a bad situation for everyone.  So the low stars on this, once more, is for the \"false advertising\" that this restaurant is truly accessible.  It's somewhat accessible, only to patrons with some mobility.  And, even then, it can lead to bad situations like the one I just experienced today.  The great food and pleasant staff made up for some of it.  But I was so hungry and tired and annoyed by the time I finally got to eat that it wasn't enough to make this a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night. The food was great! Huge portions and high quality meals. However, it was understaffed and too crowed. The tables were too close to one another. Every time someone walked by our tables, they would knock our chairs because the walking area was so narrow. I loved the food and the atmosphere, just too busy and crowed. The server was super nice, but forgot to ask us our drink order and we had to remind him twice for our refills. Not a good date night place... definitely more of a place to get drinks with friends."}
{"text":"A clever take on the American diner, Deville was a real surprise to my wife and me. We were just looking for a decent place near our hotel and we really enjoyed the place. The portions were large and the prices were reasonable.   The waiter helped us out since it was our first time at Deville and made some good suggestions."}
{"text":"I love this place : they already got me just for the pink color and the bit-retro look.  I like to come here once in a while for drinks or a burger. It is conveniently located, right downtown, next to Peel metro.  I tried their salad tonight (Macho Deville) and my friend had one too and both very delicious. We are also never deceived by their burgers !!   They have a special fun drinks menu. Every night there's a different special, but drinks are 10-14$ maybe ? I ordered one of their drinks that comes in a coconut and was at 50 deceived to pay 14$ for a glass that they've put into an old coconut (to hold it... ) but my drink was really good.  Their fries are really yummy too !!!!  Good retro music. Not too loud OK to talk  We had a really fun waiter tonight !!   Je fais juste rentrer dans le restaurant et ils m'ont déjà avec le look un peu rétro et la couleur rose !!! J'adore l'ambiance de ce resto pour venir manger un burger ou prendre un verre !! C'est vraiment bien situé, c'est à côté du métro Peel.  Ils ont un menu l'fun, avec des spéciaux sur les drinks (un différent à chaque soir). Tous les drinks à date on les a aimé !! J'étais juste un peu déçue que mon drink dans une coconut a été servi comme un drink dans un verre, mis dans une coconut sèche.  On aime beaucoup leur frite allumette. Bonne musique, OK pour avoir une conversation décente sans crier.  Mention pour le serveur qui était vraiment drôle et qui a pris la peine de nous jaser."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this cute little spot next to peel metro I fall inlove!!  The interior decor was always very chic and welcoming. They went through renovations in the winter to make the place bigger and easier to move around. It looks beyond belief amazing! I really think they do what is best for their customers.  The atmosphere is very friendly and pleasant!  The service: one word: Spectacular. They always try their hardest to get you the best table possible even when its very crowded and they are amazing over the phone to reserve a table for me when I come down to the resto. I seriously think they're one of the best restos in terms of service.  The food: Not the best but definitely beats many other mediocre places. Why I say not the best .. Their menu is great and creative it's just the execution is very poor. I sometimes get very dry overcooked meals. I don't think it's their fault. They can get super busy and not always have the food on point. Their trout, salmon, lamb which I've all ordered in the past came out a little too dry but the flavours are all their! Their coconut onion rings are delicious! Their chilli cheese steak spring-rolls are to die for.  Their cocktails are so pretty and exotic! I always go for the Hawaii 5-0 cocktail. I tried their martini once. It was very strong so we know they are not cheap on the alcohol content! Hahaha. The best desert is their Beignet/ donuts! A little advice: Order them during your meal because it takes around 30minutes to have them freshly prepared. So when it comes out they are so warm and succulent.   Overall, I love love love Deville and it's one of the most prettiest places I have been to and their service is TOP notch ! They always have the food on time with a smile! I totally recommend this dinner bar"}
{"text":"4 and a half stars for their bad girl pasta, hanger steak is over cooked resulted in the 3 stars rating. Place is pretty amazingly decorated- good for hanging out with friends and date night. :)  PS - I did order the steak medium rare ...."}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment adoré l'endroit. J'adore les types de dinerbar \"lounge\". L'endroit est cozy, lumières tamisées et néons pleins de couleurs. Avant de parler de la nourriture, je veux parler  d'un concept que j'ai trouvé vraiment original. Le juxebox dans tout le restaurant. Vous téléchargez l'application sur votre cellulaire, choissisez une chanson dans la liste et voilà votre nom apparaît sur les écrans du restaurant et votre chanson joue. J'ai adoré l'idée.   Je me suis assis au bar puisqu'il y avait aucune autre place ailleur. Il est recommandé de reservez avant. Le barman/serveur était trés acceuillant et sociable. Service rapide. Nous avons pris une entrée de petites bouchées de homards. J'étais ici pour les burgers alors mon excitation pour la bonne viande n'a pas pu apprécié emplement cet homme-mort. (Je sais elle est pas drôle..) Ensuite est venu le burger que j'avais commandé. Fromage vieilli, oignons , pickles, Sauce BBQ/Root Beer...une oeuvre d'art. Tellement de frites..elles étaient excellentes mais abusives. Ce n'est tout de même pas un défaut mais c'était inhabituel pour moi d'en laisser.   En conclusion, j'ai adoré l'endroit, la nourriture, le décor, l'ambience et c'est juste à côté du métro peel."}
{"text":"Ça se remplit vite au-delà de 12h15. C'est moderne et flashy. Le poulet rôti glacé à l'érable et son riz vert est bien bon - et servi généreusement. On ramène volontiers un doggy bag chez soi."}
{"text":"Deville is such a cool, fun place to eat.. food is amazing and the place has such a cool atmosphere and decor.. menu is pretty extensive and everything I've ever tried from here has been delicious. Good food and good servers makes for a great meal"}
{"text":"I have Been here a few times and I am always pleasantly surprised, we had a little bachelor dinner last night, we tried the Mac and cheese wontons, those are a must, the filling is nice and cheesy and comes with a great dipping sauce. The fried pickles have to be one of my favourites in Montreal, also very tasty.   I took the drive-in burger for my main, 2 beef patties with all the fixins, on a buttered brioche bun. The burger was flavourful and juicy. They have a wide variety of drinks, from beer on tap to there massive fish bowl drinks! They also have many TVs to catch the game of your interested, this place is a must.   PS take the Nutella milkshake!!!!!!!! You will be blown away!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that my very first review on yelp had to be a bad one...was saving it for something special. I went to get a takeout since I was craving Mac and Cheese and I've heard good things about this place... and mostly because midterms made me too tired and lazy to whip out a box of kraft diner. The interior design of this place is great, very dynamic and looked like a perfect place to throw a birthday party. Staffs were friendly and the place had a good vibe. Since I went there around noon I was given the lunch menu.  I mainly went there for the Mac and cheese but I also wanted to know what the hype was all about. I ordered the Maple glazed rotisserie chicken which came with poblano rice an aji Amarillo sauce. The chicken (1/2 of a whole chicken) didn't taste very special, it was meh and more importantly was very dry... I expected the breast to be dry but for the thigh to be dry as well... didn't see that coming at all considering that the meal was 21$ I've had grocery store made roast chicken more tender than this and for only half the price. The rice was ok, nothing special about it. I think what I enjoyed the most was the sauce. Yup, just the sauce (was good sauce by the way). Atleast the Mac and cheese was good, not as good as the one from Robin Square but good.   Final say:  Food is okay, nothing special but for the price you could go elsewhere. My review is only based on what I had but maybe their other meals are far better?  1 star for good interior design and ambiance. 1 star for friendly and dynamic staff. 1 star for yummy sauce and Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"What a treat. We landed from New York, and I went to yelp and this restaurant came up right away. Short walk from our hotel, and with a very eclectic menu. My kids each had the mushroom veggie burger, which was fantastic. Also had egg and Parmesan cheese, what a treat. Matchstick french fries were fresh and very good. My wife had the fish and chips sandwich or just excellent. Both the buns on the burger and the fish sandwich were wonderful. Very fresh with poppy seeds. I had the tuna with a popcorn across. Sounds crazy, but it works, adding just a little bit of sweetness. The kale Waldorf salad was excellent, A great accompaniment to the tuna. Combined with very good service, a great experience.  The only thing that disappointed me was that they would not let me substitute the risotto with a vegetable without an additional charge. But other than that very good place and I will definitely come back too."}
{"text":"The food looks good and original. But it tastes so so and very salty. Ordered the bad girl pasta, onion rings, tuna tacos (what I like most, but too salty for me) and different kinds of burgers. At the beginning, I was like oh the food looks good. I should bring other friends here next time. But when I started tasting, I kinda changed my mind."}
{"text":"The best! Food is the freshest, tastiest most amazing food. The service is outstanding and exceptionally attentive. The atmosphere is always very trendy and hip.  If your in Montreal this is the greatest place for anyone looking for a great time!!!  Always a GO TO for me when in Montreal.  I love this place so much i even bought a hat!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day because it was close-ish to my work, and took a friend.   The aesthetic of the place is very unique - a sort of early 2000s look that I'm surprised to see as a deliberate choice, given that it looks a bit like a seedy nightclub from 15 years ago. The inside was dark, purple, and incredibly loud, so we chose to sit outside. The weather was nice, and it was a much better dining/talking experience.   The menu was impressive, large, and full of creative dishes, but it was also surprisingly expensive - even the most standard burger cost $17, which I don't really feel was warranted by either the decor or the quality.  Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent - I had the Korean fried chicken sandwich, for $20 - but it really gouged out a hole in my pocket that I wasn't expecting from a place that has \"diner\" in its name.   I'm giving this place 4 stars because the food really is very good, but I just don't think it merits being as expensive as fancy dining."}
{"text":"What a rockin' and hoppin' place! We looked in the windows and thought \"eh, just another kitchy diner\". . . Then we stepped inside the door, realized there is an upstairs area, and an outdoor terrazzo. . . We were seated on the upstairs level. Within minutes, the place began to fill up, and get loud and exciting. . .  Our server Anna, was extremely fun, and attentive to our whims. I wasn't thrilled with my Hollywood cocktail, so she changed it out for another, thank you! Our dinners were excellent. I had the chicken (poulet) Schnitzel & Spaetzle. A very large piece of schnitzel that was nicely breaded and tender inside. Partner enjoyed the daily special of confit, which was truly spectacular. We enjoyed the entire evening here. Didn't really want to leave, as the vibe was just intoxicating. Loved it . . ."}
{"text":"On a essayé ce petit resto branché avec une amie! L'ambiance est sympa malgré que très bruyant, la liste de cocktail est impressionnante et tous les plats du menu sont vraiment un délice. Attention les portion sont généreuses et le prix en conséquence. Essayez le poulet sur gaufre avec sa sauce sucré style pudding chômeur wow!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Spectacular. Amazing. Any questions?   The food was excellent. Service was spot on. Lisa, who is a new server for the restaurant, was super polite, and walked us through the menu. \"The Duke\" sandwich should be illegal it is that good.  My wife ordered a lobster BLTA (avocado) and was blown away with how big and how tasty her sandwich was. The matchstick fries were a perfect addition to our first meal in Montreal.  This was a perfect way to kick off our vacation"}
{"text":"Deville Dinerbar, how I love you! We love the modern yet retro decor, and the presentation of the food was beautiful! We loved everything we ordered, and the service we received was on par. I split the Bad Girl pasta with a friend and didn't get any nasty looks from the waiter. :-) He couldn't have been nicer! And the pasta was divine perfection- huge chunks of seafood and plenty of pasta. Great location, too... we will be sure to stop here every time we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Love this burger place more than I ever could image! The atmosphere is amazing. Great for a casual date night, hang out with friends and a total girls night out. The food is seriously amazing! There isn't anything wrong, service is always on point. Alcoholic beverages are fun and tasty! Just love this place! Definitely one place you have to try once in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Fried pickles.!!!! The waiter told me why they were the best I had ever had. They were made with bread and butter pickles not dill. Who knew? I don't want them anywhere else ever.   It's super cute inside, there are many notes of Hot Pink - and the food was great.   Waiter was super nice."}
{"text":"Good food, good drink. Generous portions for a very reasonable price. Flavorful and fresh. Attentive but not overbearing staff. Nice decor. Good for anyone with a variety of options."}
{"text":"Decent place. But there are much better places if you want BBQ or comfort food. The ahi tuna is overrated. I really enjoyed the fried pickles though."}
{"text":"Our hotel recommended grabbing a drink here and I am still confused about why.  The interior is retro diner but it didn't work for me.  Frankly I hated it.  The beer and food is not priced like a diner either (not to mention the beer list was seriously lacking options).  I am just confused at why this place comes highly recommended.  We headed up to Dieu du Ciel after this and it is like 1000% better and more representative of what I think of when I visit Montreal.  I seem to be in a minority given the other yelp opinions, but whatever this is how I feel."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a fun evening with friends. The food is fantastic and they serve large portions. I love the Lobster BLT with generous portion of lobster. I'm also a fan of their beignets. You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Highly recommended. Just make sure you make reservations otherwise you can wait anywhere between 30 to 45 min."}
{"text":"Please note i only went there for drinks Their food looks to die for but on the pricey end Drinks range from $12 1.5 ro 2 oz oz of alcohol to $26 about 4 to 5 oz of alcohol $26 is a giant fish bowl   Drinks are average  Decor of the place is cute pink modern retro style Bartenders are funny, service is good"}
{"text":"After a long 11-hr drive due to stopping multiple times for my friends to take photos of their first snow experience, we finally arrived to this restaurant recommended to us by another friend.   This place was too cute and very swanky for a diner bar, even the bathroom was cute. It was a two level restaurant and my friends were already seated at the top so we joined them.   I read that you have to get the milkshake here which I did along with the lobster BLTA without the B. I'd have to say the marshmallow shake with nutella was delish and so was the sandwich as well. I wouldn't mind coming back here again if I'm ever in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fancified bar food in a Johnny Rockets meets Vegas with a dose of pink lighting setting.    Food is okay but some combinations didn't make much sense.  Prices are on the high side for the food served and I enjoyed the food I did get although I didn't find them better than what I got for lower prices in Bier Market near by.  Lamb lollipops were good overall although they were a little burned and I could taste some charred bits that weren't pleasant.   The giant steamed broccolis were well buttered and tasted fine, once you remember why we serve broccoli with the stem removed.   Ribeye on Mac and Cheese gave me mixed feelings.  The ribeye was very tender but was on the bland side itself. The sauce only made it worse, completely overpowering the meat.  I still finished it but i won't order it again.  TLDR: a decent fancified interpretation of American bar and diner foods but a little overpriced for what you actually get."}
{"text":"Pretty good vibes, nicely styled interior and exterior patio. Great music and good for breakfast, lunch or dinner - lots of variety. Great service!! Had an awesome server. However!!! The food is a little greasy doe. Js. Like i got a salad and the main ingredient was mayo. If im orderin a salad theres a reason for that."}
{"text":"The Diner club sandwich $17 is large enough for two girls, with matchstick French fries as side. Pulled lamb pasta $25 is good, not too salty with a generous amount of lamb.   Will need to try the giant onion ring next time.   One down side is that a green tea costs $3.50."}
{"text":"3 1/2 star.  It's been a while since I've been there. Lot of the previous comment criticizing the Hype + Inconsistencies are indeed correct.  We went with a Work Group and had a lot of fun. We mostly enjoyed our meal. Great thing is due to the fact we were a large groups, I've seen a lot of the Menu item. First the service was good and managed a 15 persons group very well.  Second the appetizers of many were larger than main meal. For Example my chicken waffle were almost bigger than my main plate which was tasty but a bit underwhelming after having the amazing Chicken Waffles. My Filet Mignon with a big Portebello top and some sauce and some greens and that was it. It felt like a big empty plates. A colleague simply chooses to eat a bunch of appetizers and he was better served for way cheaper.   IMO it's nice loud place for groups with money.The food is good, the service is good.  As the menu is mostly overpriced and all over the place with some Portion issues where Main dish is smaller than a appetizer."}
{"text":"This is always a fun spot to Go with friends for some great food and drinks in a nice lively ambience. The portions are generous and the food itself is always fresh and very tasty. One of my favourite items is the lobster BLT- loads of fresh lobster on a fresh bun with some crispy delicious bacon , you can't go wrong ! But their burgers are great too ! Their dessert selection is also very good , I had the pain perdu and it was perfection - my only word of caution, DO NOT attempt to eat the entire dessert yourself as the dessert portions are just as hearty as the meals !"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 friends from Toronto and we were not disappointed. Amazing food, from the appetizers (calamari, lettuce wraps, edamame) to the entrees (Short rib stroganoff, fish, chicken, meatloaf). Three of us had milkshakes and they were a perfect after dinner dessert. Very recommended."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday celebration. It was calm and quiet. Not too much people. Food was amazingly delicious and generous. Definitely recommend and for sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to eat on my 3 day weekend in Montreal.  the drinks were tasty and well priced. I loved the decor and ambiance.  Service was super friendly.  He even gave us recommendations on things to do in Montreal.  Everything looked amazing on the menu,  We started off with the mini hot dogs and tuna tacos, both were great! I got the General Tso chicken salad which was delicious,.  My husband got the business bento box that has to much food for only $18.00 CAD.   He loved it.  It came with a soup, salad, 2 huge fried pork patties and a delicious apple fritter dessert. The bill adds up quickly after drinks and apps.  We spent about $100.00 USD."}
{"text":"We had a very nice seafood risotto that was fresh, nicely seasoned, good presentation. One cocktail was too weak and the other was too sweet. The salad is probably pre mixed because they wouldn't let us have dressing on the side, so it was a bit too creamy for me. We also tried the beignets, which came out coated with a lot of sugar powder. They were nice and warm, the chocolate and cameral sauces were wonderful. Alas, after the creamy salad we weren't able to finish all of them"}
{"text":"Actual rating 4.5.  This is a cute place!  We stopped in for lunch here on a Tuesday and it was hopping.  After my meal, I can understand why.  We ordered the set meal at $15.  The server explained that it was inspired by a Japanese concept and proceeded to explain to us what a bento box was.  I giggled inside a bit, but he was quite earnest in his explanation of this style of presentation, so I did not want to admit that we have all had a bento box before many many times.  The food came out on one giant rectangular plate.  It was corned beef over top of cabbage mash potatoes, with a side of kale coleslaw and a mini dessert of some mousse thing with two raspberries on top.  Also on the plate was a bowl of cheddar soup.  Everything was very tasty though by far the soup was my favourite.  The weakest link was the corned beef itself which was a bit bland, but the side of pommery mustard and the poppy seed horseradish helped round it out.  The serving size was beyond generous and I was stuffed before I could finish my spuds.  I would absolutely return here."}
{"text":"Located in the center of downtown Deville Dinerbar serves up diner food (as you might have guessed from the name).  The decor can best be described as a modernized, trendy version of a classic diner.  There are two floors and the top one is definitely more spacious.  Foodwise, they do a good job here.  The chocolate milkshake I ordered was quite decadent.  Topped with a generous portion of whipped cream it had a strong chocolate flavour.  To add to that I tried the hot chicken sandwich.  They used a brioche bun for the bread which was a good change and added a nice touch to dish.  The gravy was quite salty but it wasn't overpowering.  The service was pretty decent.  While we did have a wait for someone to come and take our order it did pick up after that and was fine.  Our meals came quite quickly after ordering them.  I want to give this place four stars, I really do but I feel that the prices are just a bit too high for what they're serving.  The food is good but we are talking diner-style food here so $20 for a hamburger seems excessive. I think if they'd drop their prices it would definitely be worthwhile visiting this place regularly."}
{"text":"Ulysse étant quelque part ailleurs dans le monde ces jours-ci, Penelope en a eu marre de tisser devant sa télé et de manger des plats refroidis à cause de longs délais de livraison. Qu'à cela ne tienne!  On se fait belle et on court essayer le Deville. Quelques savoureux cocktails plus tard, (ce qui m'a aidée à me faire sentir moins seule dans la jeune foule nullement agacée par le volume élevé de la musique) la très aimable serveuse m'apporte MON burger. Tellement bon! Même si les pommes alumettes n'avaient rien d'extraordinaire, elles étaient somme toute bonne. La viande est d'une cuisson parfaite, a bon goût. Je craque pour le pain brioché. Mais comme la vie n'est pas parfaite,  une plus grande variété de sauces d'accompagnement pour les frites rendrait l'expérience encore plus intéressante. Finalement, le vrai bémol: le gâteau au fromage. Portion énorme mais fraîcheur discutable. L'ayant pris pour emporter, je l'aurais sûrement retourner si j'avais été sur place."}
{"text":"Chips Ahoy Cookie Shake, The D.U.K.E., and Chicken & Waffles  So this is probably the best place we ate at in Montreal. This Chips Ahoy cookie shake I had ordered for takeout barely lasted seeing the outside of this diner. It even had a chips ahoy cookie in it so that's a plus, because cookies are the tits. This DUKE burger though. So big and good, especially being hungover from the night before. It was comprised of grilled flat iron steak, topped with cheddar & monterey jack, thick cut black forest bacon, fried onion strings, BBQ mayo and a fried egg on a brioche bun. If you think that doesn't sound good then you are stupid. The best burgers have a fried egg with yolk spilling out the sides, and this was no exception. The Chicken and waffles were pretty decent too, had a nice sweet syrup on it and the waffles were nice and fluffy. Chicken was aight, it's just deep fried chicken.  This diner is also a bar and looked quite nice inside. Kind of a new school meets old school feel. It also had a patio so that's a plus and the service was pretty good as well. Kind've expensive but a place to go if you're in the neighborhood.  Sal says: Just Eat It  David says: should have got the beef dip  Mark says: too much lettuce doe  Randy says: Sal is a phag"}
{"text":"Inside out burger was so good...great atmosphere for a diner. It's a bit pricey but a great place to eat, listen to music and watch one of the many big screen TVs near the bar.....all of the staff speak English. The menu is in French and English ."}
{"text":"An aesthetically pleasing restaurant, playing off the 50s diner theme. The tables are well spaced so there was no akward bumping into other guests, and seating was comfy.   It took us a couple minutes to order because the menu is pretty big. We were brought the main menu, a specials menu, and a drink menu. The main menu consists of salads, burgers, pasta, and steaks.   We started with the mac and cheese wontons. Five mac and cheese deep fried wontons served with marinara sauce on the side. I was afraid they would be too crispy to enjoy, but they were lightly fried. Nothing too exciting about the taste but I would not change anything.  I was told Deville does burgers right so I asked our waiter for some options. He recommended the Circus burger (~$19): two beef patties, bourbon soaked pears, a dolop of caramelized onion marmalade, and brie cheese on brioche buns.   The first bite introduced me to the juicy patties. Well seasoned. Every bite after brought me the sweet taste of pear, smoky marmalade, or both! I equally enjoyed the side of matchstick fries.  My girlfriend ordered the Drive-in burger (~$16): two patties in a brioche bun, dressed with classic toppings. A very good burger but I think if you are going to Deville for a burger you should order something special. (there is a burger with cheese stuffed patties and more cheese on top!!).  We did not order dessert because we had stuffed ourselves. The dessert options sounded great so we will be back for them!"}

{"text":"J'ai attendu et attendu longtemps avant que le Deville ouvre ses portes !  Et maintenant voilà, le resto qui a élu domicile sur Stanley juste au Nord de la Sainte-Catherine est ouvert - yé !!  J'y suis allée déjà à 2 reprises ; la 1re, sur l'heure du lunch, la première semaine d'octobre (en l'occurrence, aussi sa 1re semaine en affaires) et, la 2e, ce soir justement.  Côté déco, j'trippe au bout ; retro diner de luxe, teintes de mauve et de fuschia, surfaces scintillantes, marbres, cuirette... un superbe mix entre le kitsch et le chic !    Côté bouffe ; je n'ai testé que le burger du cirque, aux deux reprises - faut croire que c'était bon !  Poire pochée au bourbon, oignons caramélisés, roquette, brie fondu sur pain brioché... Ce pourrait bien être le meilleur burger que j'ai pu manger !  Côté service, comme musique, c'était un peu décousu à ma première visite. Le souper de ce soir, par contre, m'a fait changer d'idée ; ça s'est resserré !    Un 4/5 qui frôle le 5/5... J'y retournerai, probablement pour un 5 à 7 en gang bien arrosé (leur sélection de cocktails signatures semble impressionnante, et leur cellier m'a l'air bien rempli aussi, et accompagné de bien bonne bouffe).  OPA !"}
{"text":"The food and services are great! Deville is a restaurant that has a little bit of fusion style of food, tuna taco, fried wonton,etc. The must try must be the tuna taco with their homemade sauce, amazing!! I had a problem choosing the main course because... They have so much choices and I wanted to try everything! So this time I chose... Cheese burger and new York rib steak, I was with my wife so we shared. The steak is very juicy, it served with grill vegetables as a match. The cheese burger is one of those burger that you have to eat with fork and knife. They use good quality sesame buns with 2 beef patty and Swiss cheese. It's a highly recommended place to be for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Hip, retro, flashy, classy yadi yadi ya... hey the food is actually good!  An American diner with flair and fusion would be my description. It was launched by the same brothers behind the landmark Reubens deli and Anton & James cafeteria right across the street. That gave me a positive idea of the quality of food and service. At first I thought it was just one of those new fancy burger joints in town, but I've heard good things and like the idea of an upscale diner bar serving comfort food and gourmet meals. Menu is assorted, some interesting food pairings like phili steak spring rolls or mac and cheese wontons as appetizers. The Asian influence extends onto salads topped off with General Tao chicken but you'll find plenty of classic American dishes from meatloaf to burgers and shakes.  I came here on a Tuesday evening around 5:30, expecting it to be dead but as we walked in, half the tables were reserved. Only later I figured out the busy night was due to a hockey game. I wish we could have been seated at a banquette because the top floor had really small tables and we were squeezed in next to other couples.  Waiter was professional and helpful, right away, specials of the day were introduced. He made some good recommendations, accommodated us with substitutions or special requests. I opted for the cajun salmon, since I don't do spicy, I was afraid it was going to have too much of a kick but it was nicely seasoned and flavorful. Only downside were my under cooked carrots. My partner opted for prime ribs and their \"disco poutine\" which has a blend of monterrey jack and aged cheddar cheese on shoestring fries. My friend, a self-proclaimed \"poutine expert\", first mentioned the cheese looked like Cheez Whiz and tasted like Kraft Dinner. (Honestly,  he strikes me as a picky eater) I assured him Deville wouldn't dare incorporate such ingredients! Although the gravy could have been more generous, I found this americanized version of the poutine very tasty. We also got strawberry milkshakes, a simple diner staple done well.   I would have loved to try more things on the menu, the prices just aren't very conducive to frequent visits.  Btw, free wifi is cool! I was able to check in right away ;)"}
{"text":"Love all the wacky originals stuff offered here"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! I had their Kentucky Fried Steak and it was the best Fried Steak I've ever had. The gravy was a unique corn salsa (that's not really gravy), but of a gravy consistency so it still seemed like gravy. This salsa puts a twist on American Fried steak.the buttermilk cheesy potatoes were great. The biscuit was just okay, but the other two parts made it all worth it.   As an American, I am used to choosing my own preference of how cooked I would like my steak, which is usually Medium Well. I learned in Montreal, you don't get to choose. They cook it just enough to be safe to eat. Cooking it just enough leaves it juicy, but still quite bloody. Visually it grossed me out, because I've never tried steak that was a little bloody inside, but it ended up tasting just fine.  If I return to Montreal, I will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Food was ok; had a salad, burger/fries and a beer. Good place to go with young adults or preteens. Not somewhere I wanted to try on my trip to Montreal with my fiancé. Service was great however!"}
{"text":"A diner that serves booze? Sign me up!  This place is cool & funky inside, somewhat like an old fashioned diner, but more dark like a bar. So, yeah, it's a dinerbar.  I came here with a fellow out-of-town co-worker, who actually picked this place, for dinner on a week night. Even though we got there relatively early, the place was pretty busy. We were able to get a table without waiting though. In the section we were in they do pack in the tables a little more tightly than I like, so don't come here planning to have a private, intimate convo.  The waitress was very nice and helpful and our service was generally great. I started with a cocktail, specifically a martini which was $2 off that night (Wednesday). It was big and delicious, just the way I like them. (Confession: I like girly martinis, not \"real\" martinis...don't judge me!) The crowd here trended toward a younger, more attractive set, but they still let me in.  The food was also excellent. I started with their tomato soup, which was (as the waitress warned me) a tad spicy but very tasty. The Dinerbar Club sandwich was HUGE and delicious. The chicken had a wonderful smoked flavor, and it was piled with bacon and avocado, which are two of my favorite things things on sandwiches. The parmesan grilled corn on the cob ($2 upcharge to sub for fries) was also great. Really, not a single complaint in the quantity or taste of my food. My co-worker had the meatloaf, which he described as \"amazing\", I believe.  My one complaint would be that it's a little pricey for what you get, for which I deduct 1/2 star. But I rounded up 4.5 stars to 5 because I'm cool like that and I don't have many 5 star reviews.  I'll definitely be back here, and I believe my co-worker went back the next night!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our experience here. The bad girl pasta is fantastic, the lamb shank is also great. But I would suggest it to be three dollars' restaurant. Two people with two main courses and one dessert, it took $100."}
{"text":"I like their mac and cheese samosa dumplings to start with!! Also once I had their vegetarian burger which was really good too!"}
{"text":"To preempt this review,  I am a first timer in Montréal. My French leaves me in the dark at many places.  I came in off a flight at 4:30ish on a Monday. There were 8-10 other patrons which was a relief. Reading the descriptions I was curious about the decor, and still am a little curious. It was a cross between a Miami nightclub and a truck stop diner.  My server was attentive and gave me many tips. I ended up going with the Poutine and the LobsterBLT. They were phenomenal. The sandwich was on a seaseme/poppy seed bun. As exactly as described it was a hybrid lobster roll and BLT. Well done chef.   My beef is with the fact that I was not told that by ordering the poutine and sandwich I was getting double the fries and charged twice as much. No big deal. That is until I was asked why I didn't just upgrade the fries for a small up charge. I was never told it was an option.  All in all great food, interesting decor, and really worth what I paid. However, it is common decency and good business to tell patrons about deals and how to save money or to be smart enough to not tell them after the fact."}

I think it's the must of this restaurant  Portions are really big, dishes can be shared Thanks to Bianca (the waiter)! she was happy to answer all the questions we have not only regarding the menu but also the Montreal's sightseeings ."}
{"text":"My wife and another young woman asked to use the phone as they were locked out next door. The hostess allowed it but then this bald manager came over and started yelling at her. The other woman had to hang up on the landlord and find help elsewhere. This manager has zero respect toward women!! He thinks it's acceptable for women to be locked out of their homes and berate a female staff member for trying to help. Absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"I came in expecting something more than what a diner would provide after seeing high reviews, and I was clearly wrong. It's a diner. Lasagna was definitely frozen then fried, and somehow the stuffing was unevenly distributed. Bad girl was ok. Not recommended for tourist~"}
{"text":"A little pricey but you'll leave the table full!  The Disco Poutine and the Cluck and Moo were delicious. The service was excellent; we were there on a Thursday evening and the place as hopping!  Decor is great but it is VERY LOUD here."}
{"text":"Excellent burger! And this is coming from someone who really isn't a huge burger person. But after examining what the tables around me were ordering, I decided the burger was the most popular. I got the inside-out burger and it had the freshest meat and most incredible Canadian bacon I have ever had! And it came with a great side of freshly cut and fried french fries. To top off this great burger, the place had a great fun drink menu. Now the best goes for last - one guest got the tuna salad and it was incredible! I hate salads and I have no idea what craftsmanship went into it, but it was perfect! You have to try it if you go. The greens went perfect with the tuna and it was perfectly seared. Nice spot! But busy, so make reservations."}
{"text":"Endroit à la mode, pour fêter l'anniversaire d'un amateur de bons burgers. C'est joli, plutôt classe, mais les burgers, bien que bons, ne justifient pas un peu aussi élevé...  Je ne vois pas trop ce qu'on paye ? L'emplacement, sûrement..."}
{"text":"I completely COMPLETELY agree with Wes N.   Tried this place for the first time yesterday for lunch.   First of all, there is nothing appropriate for lunch there. Like Wes said, the menu WAS very frustrating to look at. The seating is so small in the single 2-seaters that our super long menus barely fit in front of us - I mean COME ON !!!!  I ordered the \"Deville Club\" and it was so gigantic (ridiculous) that I could not eat it. I asked the waitress if they could cut it into 4 pieces rather than just two, and I was provided with a STEAK KNIFE.   I hardly ate any of it. The waitress said it is more of a \"Fork and Knife\" kind of sandwich... should I have to eat a sandwich with a fork & knife.... REALLY?! The Manager came to our table asking for feedback and kindly gave me my meal free of charge - but regardless, I did not enjoy myself at this resto from start to finish.   This resto is definitely NOT Return-Worthy. Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Came to eat here with my hubby- we weren't hungry at all! Somehow we ended up eating the tuna tacos and the salmon Cajun- both were AMAZING (I thought about ordering another tuna tacos). The restaurant has great location, it is decorated nicely and the service was very good! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I finally came here yesterday for a dinner before taking in a film at the Banque Scotia cineplex.  I have to echo many of the things other posters have pointed that 1) Portions are HUGE (if you're ordering a main, then you really don't need a starter) 2) Prices are a little high for what essentially amounts to diner food. I think charging $21 for meatloaf, for instance is a little excessive.  It has that cool, hip, downtown vibe but the look reminded me a lot of the whole 1980s Patrick Nagel aesthetic (think the cover of Duran Duran's \"Rio\" album) especially with the neon pink lighting.  The food was pretty good. I started with the cream of tomato soup and it was excellent. The meatloaf, while very filling and the portion was very generous, was a little too salty for my taste, I found.  I don't see myself becoming a regular here unless I'm in a fix given that decent dining options in the downtown core are pretty limited."}
{"text":"Service: Service was really good. Waiter was there when we needed him, He was really courteous, and the busboy was efficient. Score: 5/5  Food: I tried the fish and chips. It was part of a special menu for lunch. I really enjoyed it and there was so much food that I couldn't finish it. The second time I went there I had the lamb shank and the tomato cream soup. The tomato soup was okay, nothing special. The lamb also was okay. The meat was really tender, it was a good portion, the mashed potato was really good, but I did not really like the sauce. Score: 4/5  Drink: They have a good drink menu, and the bartender are able to make drinks that are not on the menu also. I tried the deville daiquiri in a glass so big that they call it a fishbowl if I remember correctly. It was one of the best daiquiri I ever had.  Score: 5/5  Ambiance: Ambiance was nice. I ate inside and on the terrace once. The decor is classy and modern, ambiance is quite casual, which I really like (ambiance is really good for a date). I also really loved the terrace. It is on a balcony and I thought I was in a garden when I first stepped in (perfect place for a date). Score: 5/5  N.B: The overral score would be more of a 4.5 than a 5."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that this is the review of a diner... Not some fancy haute cuisine. It is amazing.  Everything we had was complex and well balanced. I was stunned at how the quality of the ingredients came across in each dish we tasted.   Quick review of what we had: Cesar salad: Amazing... Served deconstructed, not your ordinary plain salad.  Ahi tuna tacos: excellent even if a tad too sweet for me. Chicken and waffles: best I've had so far! Lobster rolls: a classic well done. Disco fries: basically poutine, only way better.   Service was excellent. Staff is busy but remains very friendly.  Will definitely go back soon to try more of their delicious creations."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about this restaurant. Its really one of the best restaurants I've been too. You cannot go wrong with pratically evrything on their menu. From appetizers to main meals to dessets and drinks. Been there 6 times already and i always look forward to going back. Nothing we ever ate there was not good. And often the waiters will tell you what to pick or what not to pick. I had the ribs and they were fall off the bone delicious,  generous portions. My sis had the bad girl pasta and it was unbelievable. Menu is so diverse that theirs evrything for evryone. Theirs desserts are oh so yummy. My favorite is apple pie sandwich. Ive tried all of their desserts. Please Deville make new ones. Its time!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it out. Ordered a few sides and one main dish - the sides were delicious but the main dish which was the lamb shank with the pasta was really nothing to write home about and if anything, lacked flavour.   The prices are really high for what it is, ended up paying around $40 for diner food basically."}
{"text":"The milkshake and seafood pasta (named \"bad girl\" pasta) was really great! I really liked the ambiance and the service, very attentive! Also, the poutine was like no other poutine I had tried before and the fries were cooked to perfection o:) tad bit pricey, but worth it (:"}
{"text":"Seriously overrated. They have basically nothing vegetarian. The service was very slow. The food was fine, but nothing special. Definitely overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here when we first arrived in Montreal. We ordered the onion rings as our appetizer and it was quite tasty; the rings were fried well and not very greasy. The drinks are all whimsical and actually taste quite alright. We ordered the kale salad and short ribs; the food is a little too sweet for us but otherwise was fine. For dessert we got the apple pie ice cream sandwich which was very nice. Btw the place and crowd had really good energy at night, definitely a good place to go if you want to hang out at night in the downtown area."}
{"text":"So it seems like this place tries to be a high-end Instagram worthy diner, but they also seeemd to expect that we had reservatiions for lunch, never mind dinner. The place looks like a diner, except for the well dressed, trendy looking crowd. Nonetheless, the menu is crazy fun and the food is good! Hard to narrow down a choice, everything looks good! Not cheap, but huge portions. Recommend going a bit off peak hours for a less hectic experience and better service."}
{"text":"I love the twist on your favorite diner favs but done in an elevated way. Chicken and waffles, adult milkshakes, and slamming burgers. Everything is super delicious here. The place feels like a diner but with a modern twist! A little darker in ambiance with bright pink accent lighting for a fun pop! The music is fun and exciting and definitely has a vibe to get your night started."}
{"text":"We found this place just by walking around and had no clue what to expect. The burgers are fantastic! I've never had a burger as juicy and flavorful as the one I had here. The old fashioned I ordered was great. The service is great and the decor is fabulous. If you're looking for good comfort food this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite meals in Montreal - although a little expensive for Brunch! Loved the Lobster BLTA - it was a great mix of flavor! The chop chop salad was also tasty and served in a large portion - had enough for a snack that night! Disappointed that we were too full for dessert, but there's always next time!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant at all. For the price, the food does not deliver. Burger was okay, nothing special really. The fries straight up taste/look like McDonald's fries... And do not even get me started on the \"poutine\". My friend ordered that and I was beyond offended that they even call it poutine. It was salty, soggy and just awful."}
{"text":"Not too bad. The food's pretty good, and the portion sizes are fairly big. Food can be a bit greasy, but depends on the menu item you order. The service staff is mediocre, they'll answer your questions (don't expect much more). While the ambiance is supposed to recreate an 'upscale' fifties diner, it gets very loud, and the tables are a bit too claustrophobic. The drinks are decent, even if what's served doesn't match the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was okay.  I made reservation before going, so there's no need to wait."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while visiting Montréal for 2 days with family. The food, decor, and service were excellent. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and drinks. Their menu was in french and english. Their drinks menu was unique and had an interesting variety I was very intrigued!   The decor was bright with colors and had a old school cool feel to it. The service was just great! My waitress was SO nice, I was actually caught off guard. She went above and beyond to answer our questions and make recommendations. To the end, she was attentive and polite. I couldn't have had a better time here. The food was fabulous! The portion size was big, so we had some leftovers that we probably would have finished had we not been so full.   I would recommend this place to others if you're looking for a casual good time. If I'm ever in the area, I would definitely come back-- especially for their drinks!!"}
{"text":"Chic diner atmosphere with great ambience. Relatively quiet for a bar. Went for drinks and a late night snack. Very unique cocktail options. The Mojito was fantastic. Ordered the pork belly sliders and it was very delicious. The service was not bad, waiters are very knowledgeable about the ingredients in the menu."}
{"text":"Everything is five stars: venue, food, and staff. We stopped in here without reservations and were seated right away.  I found this place based on the reviews...and they were very accurate! I ordered the  new Korean chicken sandwich that came with fries. The portion is BIG. I also had the bijou martini - it's like a cosmo meets sweet grapefruit. The waitress was super nice and helped me decide between a few dishes. I am so glad I tried the chicken. It's got a sweet, tangy, mild spicy flavor with the mix of ingredients. My coworker had the mussels - it was a huge bowl and he almost didn't finish it. It can be shared. His fries came w/ an awesome Dijon aoli. I had to order a side of it for my friends after tasting it! I like the vibe of the place diner meets high end bar."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before and the atmosphere and style of the place continue to entertain. I believe music suggestions for the whole restaurant can be made from the app.  Upon sitting at our table, the couple next to us revived their dinner plates. This tall tattooed fella had the biggest smile on his face when his plate arrived. I asked him politely what he ordered and he said the Seafood Paella. He gave it a great review and after some serious contemplation I ordered it myself. Definitely have had better risotto. The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly.   The staff was delightful. They provided a great white wine suggestion. Toward the end of the meal on the outdoor enclosed & heated deck, one of the staff was cleaning and discussing with our waiter that the broom wasn't working well. Somehow the conversation became between them, us and the couple next to us about the greatness of Costco. It was wonderful."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after going to another bar just to get some drinks and finish watching game 6 of Chicago and Anaheim. What drew us in was that we were able to see a huge set up of the game from the outside and that got us inside.   We sat at the bar and ordered just a single round-but the food did look really good. Our bartender was super sweet and suggested things for us to do for the rest of our time in town. We saw big colorful salads and larger plates of fries, so based on other reviews I can say the food was probably excellent.  Overall, the interior was very aesthetic to what a traditional diner should look like. Definitely would come back here!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, large portions and very fresh. Be warned that its quite loud and hot especially on the second level. The patio door kept opening and closing which let out all the AC our and heat in. Sweating buckets while having dinner at 8pm!"}
{"text":"I went here after yelp searching a place near my hotel for poutine. They only have one dish of poutine - and that's disco poutine. Unless there are other ones that I totally overlooked. I ordered the black cherry lemonade for a drink ( this alcoholic drink )  The store is modern and clean inside with tall ceilings and large windows. Black, pink, silver is the main color scheme.   The hostess is a beautiful and tall young woman. And the waiter guys aren't bad to look at either. They are sweet enough to come up and introduce the new server if the other is ending his shift.  I didn't realize that the disco poutine would be such a large dish till it came. I honestly didn't know if I was supposed to eat it with my hands, or a fork. In the end I didn't finish it and had to pack up more than half of it to go. I liked my drink - but I don't feel like I loved it - it's all that I can say about that. Although I went around 3 and there were not that many people in the restaurant, it took them a while to notice me as I stared at the waitress, bartender, server to get the bill to pay and leave. The server did apologize when he came over to give me the bill and quickly doggy bagged my food to go.  Besides that I have nothing really bad to say about this place. The food is pricey but because it's good it makes up for that. I will go back, maybe with more people, just so I can eat more of the variety of dishes they have to offer.   Delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered the prime rib dip, blackened salmon and mussels with fries as well as the coconut crusted onion rings as an appetizer. Everything was very good. We were happy with the quality and portion size. We ordered the pink flamingo fishbowl to share, which was good, but for $29 CAD it should've been filled up to the top and it also had too much ice. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The decor was fun and they played good music. A bit pricey, but would recommend trying this spot."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée plus qu'une fois maintenant, et j'en suis bien contente. La première fois, je me suis pris un hamburger et il était GÉANT! Du style que j'en avais assez pour le lunch ET le souper du lendemain surtout à cause de la quantité de frites. C'est le fun des grosses assiettes quand tu a super faim, mais en même temps, j'avais eu l'impression de payer pour la quantité (donc un peu cher à mon goût) tout en sachant très bien que ça serait impossible, physiquement, pour une fille comme moi de terminer mon assiette. Je me sentais comme si je me faisais avoir.  La deuxième fois par contre, j'avais appris de mes erreurs et j'ai décidée de prendre une entrée au lieu qui m'a quand même très bien remplie, et j'ai profité de leurs fameux cocktails. Oh qu'ils sont bons! Ils ont des différents spéciaux pour différentes journées alors ça permet d'avoir de la variété. Et les aquariums! Oh yum! C'est à partager avec quelqu'un à moins de vraiment vouloir virer une brosse avec un sugar high intense en bonus. Attention de ne pas boire votre slush trop vite : vous risquez de vous geler le palais!  Et le clou de la soirée : les beignets chauds! Ils sont bons, croustillants à l'extérieur et moelleux à l'intérieur en plus de venir avec des sauces sucrées. Ils sont sérieusement bons, assez pour faire rivalité aux cafés spécialisés en beignes!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting pink but it suits the restaurant very well! Now, the food, it was okay, not the best but not the worst! The service was not the fastest though. For the price I expected a bit more but it was still a good experience. This should be like a $$ and a half. The decor is very easy on the eye and comfortable seats! Televisions everywhere, and interesting drinks.   By the way, try out the banana split milkshake, I recommend that!!!"}
{"text":"Very close to our hotel we decided to drop by , a very nice high end diner with generous portions , unique combinations and friendly staff. , service was a but slow for New Year's Eve but it's the season to have patience ..."}
{"text":"I visited on July 8, 2016 @ approximately 7pm with a colleague from work. We were travelling from Toronto.  FIRST: the staff - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  Here is my rundown...I arrived and had a unique situation where I advised the Christine(hostess).  She immediately brought over the Manager(his name was either Nick or Paul-sorry I don't remember), who very quickly addressed my situation and provided me a seat without waiting.  I sat at the bar and met the bartender Veronica who had the best personality and the beauty to match!  The entire time I was there, she did her work thing but always came back and made fun small talk throughout the eve.  Later on, her bartender colleague (Paul or Nick) came over and we had some more great laughs fun and conversation.  Second: Food - Veronica recommended the \"Bad Girl Pasta\" Simply put, best damn pasta I have ever had, and I travel a lot!  Veronica also recommended the Kentucky Fried Steak, which my buddy ordered, again!  AMAZING!!!!  We got there at 7pm and pretty much stayed until the placed closed down!  That's how much fun we had.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  I will be going back in August for my birthday and am already craving Bad Girl Pasta!  Thank you Christine, Nick, Paul and Veronica for a great start to our evening!  Awesome!  You get what you pay for!!!!  If you want cheaper steak, go to the sizzler!  If you want cheaper pasta, go to East Side Mario's!"}
{"text":"I love the back terrasse and the salads here are divine! Don't get the lunch size portion though as you'll be hungry an hour later, get the big one!! Every salad option can be made vegetarian and it still keeps it's delicious factor, that's a bonus.  The service here is fast for lunch and even though the prices are on the high side, there is something here for absolutely everyone. It's basically a very fancy, trendy diner with yummy drinks and a good, but very overpriced, wine list."}
{"text":"Love this place. Five stars for the overall experience.   Food quality is definitely more than adequate. Not a fine dining experience but the plates are definitely well composed.   Club music plays in the background and makes for a young exuberant atmosphere.   Ive been here on two separate occasions. Once for a bachelor party and once on a date with my girlfriend. Both excellent experiences.   Our server was patient and responsive and unfazed even with our large group of 11. She didn't miss a single beat. Every order was met perfectly. And she had no problems with our request to split the bill.   There's something to be said about the level of phenomenal service and that you get at most places in Montreal and this place is an exemplary example of that. You just don't have the same knowledgeable and well trained wait-staff here in the states, even in New York City.   I digress.   If you've read this far you've been more than kind.   Go here. Enjoy your experience. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's been open for about 4 years now and it's right in the middle of downtown. They have a very pink and purple retro decor and very vintage drinks and food. The menu is mostly southern inspired cuisine, but with a twist.   The must have here is their short-ribs. The portion of the meat is huge, tender and easily broken apart with a fork, served on parpadelles. Their seafood pasta is very good but I find it too heavy. You must also try their tuna tacos as an appetizer.   My second time there we planned a surprise birthday party in the back. The staff was very coorporative and understanding."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came on vacation with my girlfriend and we had a great lunch. The staff was kind and service was quick. We went back a couple nights later for a drink and the bar was great, too."}
{"text":"Holy hell! This food was so darn good. The appetizers were easily the best part of the meal. The Mac and cheese wontons were crunchy and cheesy with a perfect, kicking dipping sauce. The house made chips came with a three cheese dip that was to die for. The drinks were also a highlight. I had a Pop Rock Star that had pop rocks in it that exploded in the drink. It was such a cool experience. I had the Duke which was a great sandwich but I especially loved the bacon on it. Not a single item at our table was just \"okay\". The service was fast and friendly especially during a busy time and a big party such as ours!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Deville Dinerbar, and after looking up the menu online, I was set on having my birthday dinner here.   The ambiance was a nice mix of old-school diner with a funky new-age twist; the music was well-suited, but not overly cheesy. I very much liked the decor, and best of all, the menu was awesome.   The menu was a combination of southern classics, but with an Asian influence - mac'n'cheese filled wontons, philly cheese steak egg rolls, etc. As an appetizer, my boyfriend Danny and I shared the fried chicken crispers and waffles. Oh. My. GOOOD. The chicken had a perfect crisp and was actual chicken breast, the waffle was fluffy with a crispy exterior and the gravy was a perfect balance of sweet and salty, a cross between a maple syrup and light gravy. I had the Fat-Cat Burger, and the Root Beer BBQ mayo was delish. The burger itself was ginormous, so was hard to finish, but I ate until I couldn't eat anymore. Danny had the Adam's ribs; the things were huge, and he barely came up for air while devouring them. Then for dessert, we shared the pain perdu - little french toast brioche cakes drizzled with a raspberry sauce, topped with vanilla ice cream and a side of maple syrup was the metaphorical cherry on top of an absolutely awesome dinner.   I was very pleased with the service, and have urged my coworkers and boss to have our Christmas party here. I will definitely be coming back so often as my waistline can take it!"}
{"text":"Toujours sympa entre amis . Des cocktails, de la bonne bouffe qui convient à tous et de la vie en salle . Service toujours parfait . Staff à l'écoute . Du Diner haut de gamme . J y suis allée peut être 10 fois déjà , jamais déçue."}
{"text":"I've been going to Devil frequently and Was never disappointed.  If you have a big appetite try the Fat Cat. The meat was a bit dry but besides the burger was tasty and great. The grilled oignon was perfectly caramelized and had the right amount of spicy sauce to enjoy this burger. The pink light gives this restaurant a cozy aspect with its own signature. The place is clean and the lets not forget the good service we had. I would like to point out that the waitress was very respectful."}
{"text":"Good place to eat some delicious and reinvented diner food. We had the chicken Caesar salad (big enough that we took the rest home and ate as leftovers) and their house burger. This was delicious! It was moist and juicy. Yum - definitely one of the top I've ever eaten. Don't know how we had room for desert but we couldn't pass up eating the apple pie ice cream sandwich. It was massive! The service was friendly and knowledgeable, the drinks left something to be desired, but the food was delicious! Bonus is their 80s music."}
{"text":"The hostess wasn't very pleasant. She brought us to our table, dropped the menus and kept walking. We sat upstairs towards the back. The waiters were running back/forth and you felt EVERY stomp/step they took. It was very distracting when the our seats/table shook.   We had the bad girl pasta and a burger. The seafood was fresh, the sauce and pasta was delicious! It was a very good dish and I was not disappointed at all! Would definitely recommend it! The burger is meh. It wasn't bad but not memorable.   The waiters were nice and service was quick."}
{"text":"Il y a définitivement beaucoup de bruit autour de ce restaurant.  La grande majorité des bloggeurs ont l'air en amour avec et trouve que c'est quasi la révélation de l'année.  Mon opinion? Bon. Je trouve que c,est le genre de resto qui donne le look et mets énormément de budget pour une bonne impression. Le menu, le décor, la lumière, tout est intense.  Souvent, ce genre de resto, je sens qu'il essaie de détourner l'attention de la bouffe.  Et le menu est beaucoup trop long, trop de choix, pas de spécialités en tant que tel.    Pour le service, il y a des hauts et des bas.  la première fois, j'avais réservé à une certaine heure. Je suis arrivée en premier et le resto était vide.  Néanmoins, ils m'ont dit qu'il fallait que la table soit complète avant qu'on puisse m'asseoir.  Je comprends cette logique lorsque le resto est plein, mais dans mon cas... meh! Et ça a tout pris pour que j,obtienne l'attention de quelqu'un pour le menu! Les serveurs/barmans (3 ou4) parlaient, nettoyaient, buvaient mais personne n'est venu me servir pendant les 20 minutes que j'étais au bar à attendre mes amis.   Par rapport à la nourriture, encore une fois, des bons ou moins bons points.  J'ai quand même essayé une bonne grosse partie du menu les deux fois que j'y ai été.  Le restaurant essaie de se démarquer et offre des choix et des combinaisons de saveurs qui sortent de l'ordinaire.  J'y suis totalement pour pour la créativité, mais je trouve quand même important que les saveurs se marient bien ensemble... Dans le cas de Deville, souvent c'était spécial mais ce n'était pas nécessairement bon.  Prenons l'exemple des dumplings de mac n cheese frits,ça goute le macaroni au fromage... dans une pâte... frite... sans plus.  Je dois mentionner que j,ai bien apprécié leur BLTA au homard, frais et savoureux. Et ils lésinent pas sur leur portion de burger et de frites.  C'est pas donné mais tu en as pour ton argent au moins.   Mais ce n'est pas un resto qui m'a marqué comme tel.  Je suis certaine que plusieurs y trouvera son compte, mais perso, c,est pas mon genre de bouffe.  Et je trouve que c'est trop de chi chi qui n'est pas nécessaire."}
{"text":"Decoration un peu disco, j'ai bien aimé le gout des nos repas et l'originalité des certains assiettes propes à leur resto. Banquettes disponibles et petite terrasse couverte en arriere."}
{"text":"Cool retro diner with a hearty menu. Service was efficient. We did all appys at our visit. The ahi tacos are divine! May have to go back for more.  We also had the poutine which had thin fries and tasted delicious. The beef lettuce wraps were pretty good too. Very interesting twist on regular food. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Large menu, was pleasantly surprised at how good each item we ordered was. We got the mac & cheese wontons which were very good (one of their more popular apps), the bacon wrapped meat loaf which was tasty, and the spaghetti and meatballs that was surprisingly good with lots of flavor. Their food presentation is very well done, and I enjoyed looking around at what was being brought to other tables (everything smelled and looked amazing - if it weren't for the huge portions we would've ordered more). Overall we were happy with the food, wish we had the appetite to try more stuff.   Cons - it is a little bit on the pricey side, however, I would say it is mostly worth it. Also, we had called and made a reservation and repeatedly said what time we wanted, although upon arrival they could not find our name on the reservation list. We were then told basically how we were wrong and missed the reservation, even though we said like 8 times which time slot we wanted and someone put it in the computer wrong. Not a big deal just a bit surprising, maybe their customer service is slightly lacking or it was an off night. We were seated right away no problem though. Lastly, it is also very loud during peak hours so maybe consider going when it is less busy."}
{"text":"The food was amazing for me being a first time visitor. The Waiter Peter was Amazing and he provided great service. I will return in the summer to have a fish bowl on the terrace in which Peter suggested.   The Lemonade (Alcoholic beverage) was very tasty. Everything I posted food wise was excellent. My cousins and I was ready to meet the chef.   The restaurant is beautiful and I love the color scheme and atmosphere. The music selection was great as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for lunch on New Year's Eve. I had the ahi tuna tacos which were fantastic. My girlfriend had the spaghetti with meatballs that had a peppery sauce which was also good. The portion was huge. Overall the food was good and the menu had a lot of interesting choices. The service was good but the meal was very expensive for lunch. The restaurant decor was very pink but cool."}
{"text":"I loved the style of this dine-bar.  Trendy food and drinks at decent prices.   I would definitely return.   Caesar salad, burger and souther fried chicken were great.  I preferred the kook aid fishbowl to the megarita fishbowl.   Quick service"}
{"text":"Nice place for dinner.   The French Dip was outstanding. The meatloaf was as well. Didn't particularly care for the fries.   The place itself was very clean, just not the kind of atmosphere I like. Not a deal breaker, just not my thing.   The prices were ok, but a little on the expensive not.   The bar staff was terrific and did a real nice job."}
{"text":"Such a cool diner. It's more like a modern version of a diner. Cool vibes, would be a nice place to go with friends. The service was good. I had the Bad Girl Pasta which was really good, better than all the seafood pastas I've tried in Canada. It's pretty busy at dinner, I went on. Thursday. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed. I've been to Deville many many times. I've spent countless of money on this restaurant with my co-workers. Today as I was ordering my burger, my waitress asked if I wanted to exchange my fries, for a house salad or Caesar. WITHOUT TELLING ME THERE WAS an extra charge. So I agreed to the healthier choice. When my bill came, I asked her to explain why I was charged 4.00 for a mediocre side salad. She said I told, I argued back no you didn't, she then said yes I did. I Work in customer service, I deal with this everyday, you do not argue with a client, and fail to mention a extra charge. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK THERE, and so should you. I will SPREAD THE WORD  on their average menu, and imbecile waiters. DONT waste your time. Go to the old port which offers you sublime service."}
