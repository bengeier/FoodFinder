{"text":"The best massaman curry in town.  I get it with tofu.  My hubs likes the gang dang with chicken.  

Wonderful tea.  Wonderful service.

I love this cozy place in the winter... it is so endearingly ecclectic on the inside: it is small but not tight, it has a great window onto the sidewalk of East Blvd., it has twinkly lights around said window.  Walking in here from the cold, sitting down to a hot pot of tea and some massaman is a great way to spend a lunch hour but an even better way to spend an evening.

--the parking is tight--"}
{"text":"Based on  the Charlotte agenda review of Thai Taste, I decided try out this place. I ordered  Chicken Pad Thai as a carry out item and was told it would take 10 minutes. Food came out in  less than 10 minutes.  I thought that was unusually fast. Got home and ate and the food sucked! It did not taste fresh at all. The noodles seemed old or had been sitting a long time. There was also an overly powerful vinegar taste. I couldn't find the egg in my pad Thai plus there was a weird grainy texture as well that didn't taste like ground peanuts. Considering this was my first time at Thai Taste dilworth, I was definitely not pleased!"}
{"text":"Another solid corner eatery in charlotte's dilworth area. Great lunch specials and fast service."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place when I first move down from NJ, but came up pretty weak in flavors.  I'll give it another shot since my experience was take out.

Was also disappointed they wouldn't deliver to my place on Park Road because I was .2 of mile over there \"range\"."}
{"text":"Well, it took getting rid of my kids to be able to make another trip to Thai Taste.  They did not get the \"Thai\" gene.

I was so excited just making the trek north for proper Thai.  I love walking in to the dark, wood paneled dining room loaded with kitschy Thai art and fans.  

I order the same thing every time...an order of summer rolls that I do not share and the chicken gaeng daeng (chicken in coconut milk and red curry.  It has bamboo shoots, peas, carrots, green beans and thai basil).  I savored every bite even if I snarfed it down in 5 minutes.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Did not particularly care for their food.  Pretty weird-tasting pad thai.  Also, my dining companion and I both felt sick to our stomachs all day after eating here.  Would not reccommend- go next door to Verrazano's Pizza instead."}
{"text":"This place is really good. We usually get take out from here. All of the items from the menu we have had has been really good. The hot pots are awesome and we tried to order a 4 level spice and it was super spicy (we eat really spicy). The level 2 is good enough for the hot pot soups. Have ordered pad Thai, pad see we, curries. Everything was good. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"nice little Thai grub-remodeled since the last time I was there(10 yrs)  Seated immediately(7:30pm)
All the sudden the place filled up with single 26 yr females.  Food was great also-lettuce wraps were yummy, good veg stir fry."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place and it was really good. Best Thai I've had in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"I got take out. We got the red curry... Which was absolutely delicious. It was the best that I have had. We also got the pad thai which was good too but a little dry. I still think this was great thai food and I would def go back... The spicynesa was just right"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot. Went here for lunch and the special included soup, iced tea, spring roll, and my selected enter (number 5, pineapple fried rice with tofu). Food was great. Atmosphere is bustling and busy, seats are very close together. Service is pretty standard, not super quick, but efficient."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I have been going here for years. We peobably Eat here 1-2x per week. It's also the go-to when me and my friends want Thai. The servers are so nice. They now know the specific things I like in my dishes and always ask. I'm obsessed with the Mee Krob lettuce wraps. They're just so good. I could eat them as my entree. I always get them with tofu, it's small, crispy, and delicious. Mmm. I never get the same thing because it's all good. I'm a vegetarian so i can't really comment on how the seafood/meat taste but all the sauces and stir fry's are good so I imagine they are so no matter what you get with em. The Red Curry is sOooo good. It's my favorite in Charlotte and I'm a huge Thai foodie who travels all the time and always goes to Thai restaurants. I love the simple vegetable dishes with brown sauce too. And the pad Thai is amazing. I love Thai taste!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch! Never been there for dinner. Excellent Pud Thai & Great Service!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Thai taste for the last 7 years. It is small, the waitress  treats you like family and the food is great! They have a variety  of  Chinese  and  Thai cuisine to satisfy  your cravings."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday evening on the 13th of October 2013 and really enjoyed the Thai food this restaurant had to offer!  I got - Spicy Yellow Curry Fried Rice with chicken and a spring roll. I sat closest to the window(towards the road) and it was freezing inside. the vents appeared to be on full blast, luckily I brought a coat with me to stay warm."}
{"text":"Thai taste gets 5 stars for me every time. Honestly, I've never had a bad meal here. They have decent prices and appropriate portions. The best part for me is the freshness. You can actually taste the freshness in the meat and vegetables. So good!"}
{"text":"Despite my low star comment previously, I continues to go there. Their food is delicious and the cashier/server is really sweet. Make sure you got a lot of time and not hangry lol"}
{"text":"Got delivery- which is really awesome that they offer that. I ordered the pad see ew which was a little disappointing they threw a whole bunch of fried garlic in top. All I could taste was fried garlic. I also ordered the beef and meatball soup which also had a whole bunch of fried garlic. Don't get me wrong I LOVE garlic. But their garlic usage overpowered all the other flavors. At least offer it on the side. I also got the honey walnut shrimp. Now THAT was good. The shrimp was nice a crispy even with the thick sauce on top. I enjoyed that one a lot. And their Thai tea. Loved that as well. Some places make it too sweet. This one is just perfect."}
{"text":"Thai food is my favorite international cuisine, so when I asked around for the best thai restaurant in Charlotte, Thai Taste was first on everyone's list.  And, after visiting there myself, I know why: It was totally delicious!!!  

The atmosphere is very pleasant, and I wanted to put the Sake set in my purse and run--totally adorable!  The waitress was very friendly and took our order quickly, but without rushing us. 

My husband got the Panang with pork, level 3, and it was fantastic (I feel like I ate most of it after I finished my more healthful choice, which was delicious as well).  The sauce was spicy, but not overwhelming, and the meat was very tender.

I had the stir-fried asparagus with chicken, and it was very tasty, despite being a 'healthier' option. I did add some mystery sauce that was on the table, just to try it out, and it was good as well.  

We also both got brown rice, which was perfectly cooked, and not too crunchy, as poorly-cooked brown rice can be. 

The prices hover around $13 a person, without appetizers, and I had 3 more meals later that week from our leftovers.  A very reasonably priced menu.  Overall, this was a great dining experience, and we will go back many, many, many, many times!!!"}
{"text":"Best Pud Thai I have had in Charlotte!! So delicious, I cannot stand when my Pud Thai is overly sweet and peanutty, if you like that kind of Pud Thai, this one is not for you.  It was absolutely delicious and the perfect balance of sweet and tangy."}
{"text":"This place has always been a solid choice and I haven't been a while. I ordered the most basic thing you can get; Pud Khana (stir fried shrimp and veggies with oyster sauce). What I got was steamed veggies and shrimp, the sauce was bland with no attempt to incorporate it into the dish. They basically ladled the sauce on the bottom of the plate, then put the steamed food on top like an after thought. Oddly disappointing, and something that should be simple to do.  
I took one bite, waited for my dining partner to finish with his (which was just OK) we asked for mine to be taken off our bill, the server was ungracious and didn't ask what they could have done to make it better. If their response was different, I would not be writing this review. At this point in the economy, we can not stand spending money on businesses that disappoint. Needless to say, this place is out of our rotation.
As we were leaving, they had a sign on the door saying they had to raise their prices. Sadly, it seems like they've had to lower their quality in the process."}
{"text":"They removed the Nam Prik Nam Pla or Thai Chilis in Fish Sauce from their spice tray, and refuse to bring it back when asked.  Food isn't good enough to exist in its own.  Major culinary faux pas.  

Save yourself the trip and go to Monsoon Thai Cuisine,  half a mile down the road.  Infinitely better and cooler joint."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Charlotte. I love their Pad Kee Mao. The food is always flavorful and fresh. They can get busy but they always have great customer service."}
{"text":"After finding this little gem about a year ago in Dilworth, we still keep going back to Thai Taste for our Thai food.  We don't go anywhere else! The staff is superb, and always recognizes us when we come in.  They even know us when we call-in our order to pick it up!  While everyone usually goes for Pad Thai, we always go for the red curry.  Their seafood red curry is absolutely creamy and well-seasoned that you can help but drink every last drop of the sauce! My partner always goes for the Tofu red curry, which is her all time favorite.  All-in-all, Thai Taste is a great place to dine-in (when it's not overly packed), or to take home for an evening of dinner and a movie!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Charlotte! But do yourself a favor & get it to go because the wait staff (besides the man at the counter) is extremely rude."}
{"text":"Always crave their curry weekly!! Fast service. Great Thai tea. I personally don't like pad Thai but definitely venture off and order other dishes than pad Thai and you won't be disappointed. Every one does their pad Thai differently."}
{"text":"SUCH a good place. Even on busy days, servers are happy to help anyone in need, food can be made to your desired heat level, and it's fast and very reasonably priced. Portion sizes are just right and the atmosphere is relaxed. Be prepared to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Thai Taste is the only Thai restaurant I strongly recommend because I can't trust other spots besides Basil n' lime and this one. The freshness and quickness of service is satisfying and never lets you down. I wouldn't go anywhere else (:"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday friend, and we both are still feeling incredibly SICK from the food. She said it's never happened to her before so maybe it was a fluke but it was my first experience there and now I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pad Thai I have had! The spice level was also on point. Great selection of sauces too. Will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Thai Taste is an easy, casual neighborhood spot with fresh food, fast and courteous service. Good for take out or sit in."}
{"text":"Really Clean Restuarant.  Really Fresh Ingredients.  You won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I love kana-mookrop from here. It's the best dish in town. I give it 4 stars because sometime they did not open their restaurant on time."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!!! i saw one people at the front door who seat guests blow his nose into the corner of the resturant onto the floor while he thought nowone was looking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

we got up and left."}
{"text":"By far, this is the best Thai in Charlotte. Unpretentious and great food and service, my husband and I only come here for any and all Thai. 

The red curry has the right amount of veggies and the veggie pad thai are the best dishes. Also, if you say you want the spice factor 5 out of 5, they truly make it very spicy, so beware!  Otherwise, just request it medium spicy and ask for dry chili on the side."}
{"text":"The food is good but doesn't excuse the waitstaff , unwelcoming and seemed very preoccupied with something other than a paying customer, who had to go to the front and get their own napkins, order a to go meal and also get an extra spoon.  They are rude and honestly make you feel like very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I am rarely moved to this but come on Really! Takeout for $31.00 for Pad Thai and Green Curry dish.  My constructive criticism is that $31.00 for Rice and Noodles with some spice is completely highway robbery.  I will now take take my business to Thai Thai takeout for the same price I get three meals."}
{"text":"Great take home joint.  Fast service too!

Justin will always remember your order and give you tips to complement your palate. I truly enjoy this local hot spot and just wish I could take them with me!"}
{"text":"Thai taste is kind of a misleading name as this isn't really thai food. It's  Americanized, \"in the style of\", thai food. 

Now I'm not here to say that the food I ate was bad. It was good enough, but good enough wasn't what I was hoping for. If you ask most americans if they like Thai food, those that don't will probably say they don't because they don't like spicy food. If you are one of those people, you will love Thai taste. In order to get food even remotely spicy, you need to ask to have it made spicy and though I didn't know this at the time, the people at the table next to us did and still seemed disappointed at the spice level for \"hot\".

If you're out on the south side and need a quick, fairly cheap meal, I would say Thai Taste is worth going to. If you are out seeking some good Thai food, I recommend going elsewhere. You will not find it here.

Other than that, the location is nice, the staff was nice and prompt, and the prices were good. Everything was good except for the americanized thai food."}
{"text":"I love their food! Only thing is sometimes they have random times they're closed. Still highly recommend them! Love the staff!"}
{"text":"I only give it 2 stars for the atmosphere and service and promptness of the food arrival. It didn't taste good. I think pad Thai is a good measure of any Thai restaurant, if they can't get this right I have little faith in other dishes. The sauce was too much and too sweet. In fact it tasted like the sweet and sour dipping sauce with chili added. There are much better places to eat Thai food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit this place almost on weekly basis either sit down or take out.  We cannot get enough of their Pad Thai. It is full of flavor great portions. Their souls are great and we love the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Love their vegetarian pad thai.  The were very accommodating with my plant strong eating style.  Can be a little crazy to get a table at lunch time.  So get there before 12 to beat the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I love having a hole in the wall eatery within walking distance of my house that serves authentic and inexpensive Thai food.  Real quality stuff here, especially if you like hot Thai food, and I mean really hot!  

I had the pad Thai with shrimp and pad see ew with crispy duck (over two visits), and both were delicious.  I only hesitate on the fifth star because of some late night disruptions.  Try the four or five star and you will know what I mean.

Check this place out, and shoot me a txt if you are going, I will walk over and have a beer."}
{"text":"After hearing all the great reviews about this Thai place, my bf and I finally gave it a try.
So, glad we tried this place! 

For appetizer we have the Koong Gra Bok, it was really crispy, deep fried, not the healthiest, but still so good. For the main entree I had The Beef Pad Thai, it was so flavorful and sooo good! 

Service was great and quick on a late Saturday night.  Can't wait to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with Thai Taste.  It's a tiny hole in the wall, but I've never had to wait long (if at all) for a table and have always had decent service.  I love the cluttered, over-flowery decor.  And the food is very, very good.

I often go for lunch because their lunch menu is so outstanding.  Each day of the week the menu features a different ingredient (I know that Mondays are mushroom day because that's the day I usuall go), and the dishes vary slightly according to how well they showcase the ingredient.  I've had several of their curries, along with their pad thai and fried rice, and it's all been fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I would argue that the best pad thai I have ever had in my life is located in Gainesville, Fl. I tried Thai Taste after reading a bunch of reviews that it was one of, if not the best in Charlotte. I enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant and can't say anything negative about the wait staff. Its a nice location in Dilworth. I of course ordered pad thai. I was a little unfairly disappointed, but I usually am with pad thai. I am always in search of a dish that tastes as amazing as the one in Gainesville. But that's not fair to try and compare....sooo, I give this restaurant 4 stars. While not the pad thai I crave love and desire....this was still very tasty and I enjoyed my leftovers just as much the next day. I will definitely return. P.S. My husband loved his food too. P.P.S. I think I need to just end my search for the Gville pad thai flavor and I should be okay. Maybe."}
{"text":"The parking lot began filling up before the restaurant opened. (A good sign indeed). They were busy and handled the crowd well. My guess is that they are used to being busy.  The red curry and pad Thai were both delicious. Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Worst service.  I have gone here for years and will never go back.  The waiters were rude and completely terrible.  With all the great Thai options in Charlotte- go somewhere with a welcoming atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Thai I've had in Charlotte. Which is sad, I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Thai Taste makes the BEST Thai food I've ever had. I highly recommend the pad thai, panang curry, thai salad (best peanut dressing ever), and the spring rolls. I've never been disappointed.  I do recommend getting take-out and not delivery, as the delivery takes an hour or so (even if 5 min away).  

If the food at thai Taste was less expensive I'd eat it every other day!! :)"}
{"text":"I have lunch here weekly. Thai Taste is one of my favorite restaurants. I also occasionally eat at the University location. Both locations have great food. Also, the soup that comes with lunch is delicious. My only complaint is that they are very busy at lunch time so sometimes you have to wait, but the food is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Best service and Thai food by far vegas had very few mom and pop authentic ethnic food besides Mexican food . If you want pre cooked soggy Comerical fast food go to Panda Express but if u want fresh cooked home made its this place two people run this place from a-z and that's putting heart and soul into something. 
   Not some guy cooking for min wage not giving a crap scratching his ass and not washing.  Five stars 10 if they had 10"}
{"text":"Less than average Thai food and way overpriced for what you get"}
{"text":"Solid. Not out of this world, but Thai Taste is solid.  The prices are reasonable, and whenever I need my Pad See Ew fix, I'll head to TT.  There are restaurants light years better in Boston and Chicago, but for now, TT will do. 

The ambiance is kind of old school, tables with plastic covers the random wood-carving, and a hammock hanging from the ceiling with a fake person napping inside.  It's not my favorite, but hey, it adds to the charm. 

Since this place has been reviewed so many times, I'll just give my 2-cent tip. Lunch specials are a great value.  For about $6 or $7 bucks, depending on the protein you pick, you'll get an entree (some with rice), a spring roll, soup and iced tea.  (Iced tea and soup not included if you get lunch special take out.) 

I've gotten the squash special, which is stir-fried yellow squash and protein of choice...that was an insane $12.95 by comparison.  (The dish itself was OK, not as flavorful as the Pad See Ew and the squash for some reason had a squeaky sound whenever I bit into them.) 

Overall, it's a nice neighborhood joint where the service is good, and you will have a good meal.  Maybe not stellar, out-of-this-world great (like Paula Deen would say) but you'll leave happy and very full."}
{"text":"Best Thai near uptown by far.  May not be as trendy as Thai Basil but the prices are reasonable and the food is considerably more authentic.  Staff speaks Thai & Lao."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte, I had a hankering for something other than the usual southern and fast food fare.  Found Thai Taste and was taken with the attractive room and ambience.   The service was not overly friendly, but oh well. The Tom Kha soup was excellent.  The pad Thai, not so much.  It was weirdly saucy and blah, instead of fresh and flavorful.  Also, prices were not cheap."}
{"text":"I had this for take out earlier in the week and was really disappointed. I did order Chicken Pad Thai which is probably the most basic of Thai dishes but still it wasn't nearly as good as other Thai places I have had. This place has potential but did not deliver during my first experience."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go for lunch if you work in the area.  At least...that's what I'd assume by the cars stacked on top of each other in the parking lot.

Thai Taste is decorated in that dark Thai motif we've all experienced before.  They were shy a few golden elephants...but I'll let that slide.

The food here is good.  I have enjoyed all of the dishe2 I've tried.  The food was however...a bit surprising.  The Pad Thai for instance...doesn't taste like Pad Thais that I've become accustomed to.  Good...but different.

The prices are reasonable and the service is fairly prompt.  You do get a little close for comfort with some pretty cramped seating...but hey...that lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with work pals and got the pud khing sod with seafood and it was delicious. The lunches start with a light miso tofu soup and the main dish comes with rice and a spring roll. Love the hot sauce selection. The service is super speedy; small place so it's tight in there. Will try the pad Thai next. That's what everyone typically gets here because  it's so good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Charlotte - hands down! I am obsessed with the Massaman Curry. My husband & I have tried many different entrees here, everything is always so delicious. 

The only reason I am giving Thai Taste 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service leaves something to be desired. Very slow and not very attentive. Generally, we just get take-out (and for that, I'd give 5 stars.)"}
{"text":"This is by-far the best Thai place in Charlotte. I have visited both locations of the restaurant. However, I think the older establishment on East Blvd. has better food and service. Whenever my sister comes in town, we make sure to visit Thai Taste. It's become a tradition!

Love the Pud Thai!"}
{"text":"GROSS. We got pad Thai and it tasted like straight vinegar. We got 2 of them and one tasted worst than the other. When we just mentioned the response we got was \"it's been our recipe for 30 years\" and the lady just walked away. Definitely never coming back again and would not recommend anyone to either. We both came home and ended up getting sick to our stomachs."}
{"text":"Mmmm Thai Taste.  You are delicious, if you weren't aware.

Reasons I like Thai Taste:

- Location, location, location.  East Blvd. is in the heart of Dilworth and near the gym, so it's only natural that I can pick up take-out orders or meet a friend at Thai Taste.

- Quality of food.  I'm a pretty boring Thai eater.  I stick with Pad Thai or Red Curry for the most part, but even so  you can definitely tell a difference in quality from one place to the next.  The Pad Thai made spicy is pretty stellar.

I only have two complaints about Thai Taste, one is pretty relevant and one is because I'm ridiculous.

Relevant - Menu selection.  Didn't seem like a large choice in dishes and I know a lot of the other Thai places I've been to had more of a selection.  I found a dish at a restaurant in University I wanted to try at Thai Taste and it was nowhere to be found.

Ridiculous - I drink a lot of diet coke, and Thai Taste serves them in cans which means that I can't drink nearly as much diet coke as I'm used to."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai with Chicken in town and their Thai Tea is something special as well. The atmosphere is cozy and great for lunch or dinner. And a bonus is while you are waiting for take out, you can go next door to the Paper Skyscraper to waste some time."}
{"text":"This is my go-to thai take out place! I can't offer too many reviews on the various dishes because I order the pad thai with medium heat every time and it is delicious! The egg rolls are good, too! Another plus would be that the guy who runs the take out, he makes everything easy and is really friendly."}
{"text":"I went back to Thai Taste for dinner and got the Pad Thai.  Unfortunately it didn't rock my world.  Last time I visited I got a unique dish and thought my personal tastebuds were to blame, so I figured I would make a standard selection this time around and be amazed.  For the price, this pad thai was just alright.  If I visit again I will have to go with Tonya's suggestion of C-3.  For now, Thai Taste will have to live with a 3-star rating."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try Thai Taste for a while now, as we love thai food and it is fairly close to our apartment. Unfortunately, for us, we weren't super impressed with the service or food. 

We ordered delivery on Sunday night. I was told it would be an hour wait, which was completely fine! 2 hours came by and I was literally about to call the place when the delivery guy knocked on the door. He apologized for being late (kinda laughing while saying it) and said they lost our ticket. I mean, I get it, people make misstakes in life. But geez, throw in a egg roll or something or atleast be sincere with an apology. Because of this, I have a feeling our food was just sitting under a warmer for a very long time.

I ordered the red curry chicken and my husband ordered the chicken pad thai. The red curry was actually very good. Big portion of chicken, veggies, rice, and red curry sauce. The pad thai was very much lacking. It was super sweet (even though we asked for like 4 star spicy) and tasted crazy bland and a bit stale (maybe like it had been sitting under a warmer for the past hour). Prices were a bit high for dinner. With tip and delivery fee, our total was about $30 or so. 

If we decide to go back again, we definitely will be skipping the delivery and just picking up instead."}
{"text":"My choice for Thai in Charlotte.  I've been eating here forever plus they delivery to our house (bonus!).  I'm a fan of the red curry w/ tofu, the lettuce wraps, and the pad thai of course.  Tell them how hot you want it and if you are getting takeout don't forget to ask for the chili-garlic sauce!  Also have hit up the University location for lunch - same great stuff."}
{"text":"No thanks. That's all I can really say. The wait for a call in order was ridiculous (Pad See Ew doesn't take that long) and my chicken had a weird taste as if it was marinated in something that didn't go with my dish. I've tried almost every Thai place in Charlotte-Thai is my favorite- and this is just not good. My go-to \"try out\" dish is basic so I don't put faith in trying other dishes if they can't get that right.

I will say that the people were really nice though."}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 restaurants in Charlotte, a place that's dependably delicious.  I Really like the Pud See Ew, a thick noodle dish pan fried with broccoli, and egg and your choice of meat, I always go with beef and its never let me down.  The portions are decent i wouldn't say they are large, but they are filling.  I also really like the Gaeng Dang a delicious curry dish made with coconut milk, and your choice of meat, chicken is always good, but shrimp is really great.  The creamy coconut milk juxtaposed with the hot curry is poetry in my mouth, deliciousness.  The ambiance is comfortable and small with lots of Thai wood carvings all over the walls and ornate complex origami and colorful mobiles hanging from the ceiling.  Thai Taste is a little pricey and not as much food as you get at other Thai restaurants in Charlotte, but still a great all around restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Thai taste for many years. The location on East blvd is the best location in my opinion. Service is great and if you are lucky to have Koon as your server she is kind, welcoming, and attentive. 

I have tried many dishes and some are better than others. So I'd like to share my favs. I recommend trying Pad See Ew, don't be afraid to add additional veggies. Oh the classic shrimp Pad Thai. I recommend a little light on the sauce for these two dishes, gives a nice texture to the noodle dish. 
Pad woon sen I love this one too, I find it a very light dish that does not lack on flavor (reminds me of a fancy chicken noodle soup without the soup :) and I always request my fav veggies. Fried rice is also very light and fluffy, and can be added to any dish on the side as a compliment. My husband really enjoys Gra Tiem Prig Thai (garlic stir fried dish) and adds broccoli. 
Massaman Curry is fantastic and once again add a couple of your fav. veggies to compliment the delicious potatoes to help soak up this wonderful sauce. The Green curry dish is very good as well. My fav soups are the Tom yum and Tom kha. Obviously I Love my veggies and this is my preference when having Thai food. Request any veggies you want with these dishes, Thai taste is most accommodating to your special requests. 
What makes this Thai restaurant 5 stars and keeps me coming back is the warm and kind atmosphere, always fresh lightly cooked veggies, and can be one of the best options for a healthier dish when you are looking to dine out. I hope that your experience is as wonderful as mine. 

- Lily"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Monday evening for dinner and was quickly greeted and seated. It wasn't busy when we get there, but the place filled up and a line of to go orders where on the counter. 

Started off with the spring rolls, so hot and yummy! I got the Khing Sod with beef, it was light and full of veggies. I loved the ginger strips in it. I also had a bite of the chicken pad Thai and it was sweet. To me, it had a slightly different taste then you're standard pad Thai, not a bad thing. Portions where enough to take home. Sauces were available on the table and service was great!"}
{"text":"Finally I found good Thai food in Charlotte!!  After eating at a few mediocre places and one that was downright gross (ahem...Monsoon, I'm talking to you), at last I have found Thai food that is up to par.  First of all, the atmosphere of this place is great.  It's quiet and quaint, perfect for date night or a chill night out with friends.  The location is fantastic too, positioned right in Dilworth with Uptown just a skip away.  I'm a Pad Thai fanatic, so I always stick to the standard, and this did not disappoint.  The sauce was just nutty enough without tasting like peanut butter and the spice level was right on for my taste.  I always have tofu in my PT and theirs was super tasty, not soggy or squishy, but texturely pleasing.  I had the best soup too, but I can't remember the name of it for the life of me.  It was a spicy, salty broth full of chunks of squid, shrimp, and a whole yummy juicy scallop floating in the middle.  Awesome.  My bf and I each had full portion meals, soups, spring rolls, and hot jasmine tea for 35 bucks + tip.  Very reasonable, great service, great atmosphere...I will be back many times I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Coming from South East Asia and having been to Thailand twice, I am very critical when it comes to Thai food. The food at Thai Taste is very decent compared by Charlotte's standard, much more authentic than Basil. Decor is very warm and welcoming. Customer service is above average compared to the majority of Asian restaurants. 

Lunch rates are reasonable, but I would not pay close to 20 bucks for a dinner dish. All in all a good place for a quick lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food is plentiful and the atmosphere is shabby chic thailand.  A little pricey for the decor but not for the neighborhood as it's tucked in Dilworth on East Blvd.  All in all, a good place to get a large sized portion of Thai food."}
{"text":"Poor service for the price on the menu. It is cold and drafty. Food is good but I would not recommend eating in.  I would either do lunch at a more reasonable price or take out."}
{"text":"My roommate and I was carving some Thai food. We decided to go here since we heard great things.... The service was not that good. There were multiple servers walking around and not acknowledging us for a good 15 minute as we wait impatiently to order food. Finally, when someone did we order two pad Thai - one chicken and the other beef. The pad Thai was too wet and wasn't that good. Not enough chicken, bean sprouts and onions. Overall, the price you pay for it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with 2 other adults and a toddler. Food was good, not spectacular. Service was slow and it took a long time for us to be able to place our order, which meant cranky toddler and increasingly cranky adults.

Almost all the tables had a young child at it, so patrons feel comfortable bringing their children there.

One dish, Gaeng curry, was noticeably hotter than the others. However we weren't asked our spiciness preference so I am not sure why the difference.

If you are curious what the \"pea-carrot\" ingredient is that shows up in many of the dish descriptions, it is frozen veggies from a bag.

Overall, an enjoyable dinner though we will probably keep looking for another place to get our Thai fix."}
{"text":"Placed order with Eat24. Took nearly 45 minutes to get my order- got the impression that they didn't even start cooking it until I showed up. Food quality is very mixed- tasty dishes with low-quality ingredients rendering the dishes themselves poor.

THAI CHICKEN WINGS appetizer- tasty six-piece order of wings with extra sauce, delicious aroma was a bit better than the actual taste. 

KANA MHOO KROP (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and oyster sauce)- portion is half the size of other entrée ordered, and pork used in this dish is either super dry/old or fatty. Could not eat the protein in this dish. If I wanted just Chinese broccoli, I would have ordered that. I didn't pay $10 for this dish to consist of pork jerky and broccoli. I will say that the sauce was tasty though.

PAD SEE EW- ordered this medium heat with beef and it was a huge step up from mild and the protein was also tough in this dish. Overall it wasn't bad though. 

TOM KHA- soup was delicious! Pleasant surprise. Good size portion, good complexity of flavor, plentiful tomato and mushrooms. Unfortunately, also plentiful chunks of ginger, comparable in size to the pieces of chicken. Tasty though!

Service was polite but very slow. Placed order, waited 15 minutes to leave, arrived around 25 minutes after placing order. Waited an additional half hour. No other patrons were present. 

Order also asked for an additional cup of oyster sauce on the side, but they were unable to do so, saying that they didn't have packets of this condiment. I asked if it could be put in a small plastic cup, they said they couldn't do that because they have the oyster sauce in a huge gallon-size container in the back, and they would have to open the container in order to get me some. I'm baffled as to how on earth they managed to get the sauce into my dish but are completely unable to put it in a cup.

Food quality was such that it seemed a great recipe was being used for these dishes- someone clearly knows their business with this cuisine. However, the cook is either limited to low-quality ingredients or simply does not care, because the actual execution is lackluster."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is a staple in my life, and has been for at least 3 years.  Thank GOD there is another one down in Matthews now (closer to home), but this one is a lunch-time sit down or dinner-time take-out standard.  
If you are coming for lunch, be prepared to either (A) come a tad early to beat the rush or (B) wait a moment... the staff moves their behinds to get everyone seated and fed in  timely manner, but there is only so much they can do!  I love that hot soup is served as soon as you sit during lunch (not sure about dinner, but I'd assume so)... I love that all tea is served without sugar, but there are either simple syrup or sweetener options on the table... I love that the food is fresh, delicious, and perfectly spiced to my taste EACH and EVERY time!
My favorite meal here is their Pra Rarm Long Song with shrimp and a bowl of Gaeng Jerd with tofu... I get this to go for dinner whenever my husband and I do a take-out night.... it's enough for two meals, and it's simply irresistible to me!  My second favorite is Pud Thai with shrimp... I love it super spicy!!
As long as this restaurant stays in business, I will be a loyal customer! DELISH and PERFECT every time!  Service with a BIG beautiful smile!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai! 

I stopped by here while working out of town. I ordered a Panang Curry with beef on spicy level 3. It was surprisingly delicious! I say surprising because most Thai I have had in the past tend to be just a tad too salty. My entree was actually just a tad under-salted, but this was great because the broth was so full of flavors and potent that it didn't need to be dressed up with salt - one of the best Thai curry dishes i have ever had. 

Having a great meal means alot when you are traveling and working out of town. Thank you Thai Taste for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch .  It looked quaint, fairly crowded and we thought it would be an opportunity to enjoy great Thai Food. Instead it was mediocre.  A Hugh disappointment. The $18.00 \"grouper\" special was tilapia instead and undercooked !  
Don't waste your money or time.  Find another Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"We didn't have a lot of hope for Thai food in the QC.  Oh don't give me that look.  True, maybe we were being prejudgemental.  Okay yeah we were.  Thai Taste is a sweet deal.  Plenty of food in a serving, yummy Pad Thai (spelled Pud Thai here) and yellow curry (you know, the more mild one with a heavy coconut influence), modestly priced, maybe 10-15 for dinner.  Lunch specials seem to be quite a steal, for under 10 bucks you get a hefty entree with spring roll, soup and that nectar of the gods, Thai iced tea.
The place has busy Thai art on the walls, plastic on the tables, and a fairly authentic feel overall so come on and enjoy yourself.  Also their website is cute.  Check out the staff photos."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Charlotte. It's never disappointed me and I always have consistent service, quality food and an overall enjoyable experience. It's a charming set up and I dig it much more than the Matthews location. I love food, especially Thai food but I've never ventured out of the pad Thai route at Thai Taste. It's just been so good to me I can't imagine cheating on the pad Thai and getting something else. Maybe one of these days...... 

While you're there, check out Paper Skyscraper next door!"}
{"text":"The food here is really great, but the portions are quite small compared to other Thai places. For example, I only got 2 pieces of broccoli and 6 cubes of tofu in my veggie massuman curry. That said, it was spicy without being unbearable, and the curry was rich and delicious."}
{"text":"It's certainly one of my two favorite Thai restaurants in Charlotte (Thai Orchid is the other), but after spending two weeks in Thailand, I found myself wondering if there is great Thai food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One and done! 

It was not great, but not bad! I just didn't like it. 

Soup - similar to a watered down chicken flavor broth. Ok if really hungry. 

Spring Roll was cool to the touch and not the best

Broccoli & onions in a Brown sauce with white rice - The taste was only ok. The onions had a hard outer layer too tough to chew through. The rice had a dry coating on the outside like it was sitting out for a bit. 

PUD TUA NGOCK with Shrimp- my friend thought it was mediocre. She said it was a good sauce but wouldn't go back again. If forced to go back, she said she'd order it again."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai I've had so far in Charlotte. I've tried their curry and pad tai. Both very good and large portions. I got take out back to back so that should say alot :)"}
{"text":"Chicken basil is good. Kinda salty. Fried rice is just white rice with egg. And the pad thai taste like sour cardboard. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Decent lunch deal. The food was good but I have had better pineapple fried rice in my life. The service was fine but no frills. I would go back but it is not my favorite Thai place yet."}
{"text":"this place is awemasing everything from the pac man table to the exquisite menu to the calming ambiance that fills the building if you are low on funds and want a relaxing place where yiu can enjoy good hospitality or even a place to take a dwte my friends the is the place it is \"to pro\" - Jacob"}
{"text":"Great Thai food, among the best in Charlotte. And it even compares favorably to Thai restaurants in other cities where I've had excellent Thai food, like Chicago and Philadelphia!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Thai Taste for while now and have happy with the red and yellow curries. The egg drop soup is awesome. The people work here have always been friendly and courteous. They are very good at remembering your name and past orders. It takes a bit of time for them to cook the food but is well worth it."}
{"text":"I have only had take out here. twice. both times I really enjoyed the pad thai & the red curry w/ chicken. Both dishes had great flavor. I highly recommend both!"}
{"text":"Of the two Thai restaurants that I've tried in Charlotte, Thai Taste definitely ranks much higher than the other.  Every dish I've tried from red curry to green curry to pad thai to jasmine rice dishes has left a smile on my palate.  I typically order one of the curries over the other dishes, though, because it's rare that I get to have curry when dining out.  

During one visit, one of my friends ordered a Thai iced tea and suggested I try it.  I did, expecting something of a green tea variety.  I know this may sound ignorant and I like to think of myself as somewhat of an international foodie, but I was surprised to find that the Thai iced tea came out looking like a creamy orange iced coffee.  I tried it...and I've been hooked ever since.  And since then, I've tried other Thai icea teas (including the canned variety sold at World Market) but no place has yet to compare.  Thai Taste's Thai iced tea has the right amount of sweetness and smoky flavor that others don't.  SO delicious!  I could drink glass after glass...if I ignored the calorie content that each probably has.

Their prices for dinner are a little on the higher side than I'd like, so I typically reserve Thai Taste for lunch.  They have fantastic lunch deals.  For under $10, you can get a delicious Thai dish, Jasmine rice, soup, spring roll, and an iced tea!   The only problem is that they're not open for lunch on Saturdays.  Bummer.  You could combine shopping at Paper Skyscraper on the weekend with lunch at Thai Taste (they're in the same plaza)."}
{"text":"I have been here now numerous times and I truly feel it's been consistent my boyfriend always gets the same thing as do I and its been just as good as the first time we went there!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Taste twice now and can say that it's legit, but not the best Thai food I've ever eaten. People I know swear by it--I have friends that go at least twice a week--and it's very close to my house, so I've eaten there a few times.  Both times I have been very pleased with my dinner, but not totally blown out of the water.  Please don't ask me to remember the names of what I ordered, I usually just point, but it's always been good.  

As a vegetarian, I like that almost everything can be made with just veggies (and tofu, if you want) and that everything is made fresh, so if you don't like a certain thing (say, carrots aren't for you) it's no problem at all to leave something out.  On my last trip I was avoiding carbs (which is hard as a vegetarian) but I was able to get a sauteed bowl with tofu, broccoli, spinach, and snow peas in a yummy sauce.  They totally skipped all the carby vegetables and rice for me.  It was a win! 

Also, the servers are friendly and efficient.  And the prices are decent, especially for this area. For me, good food, customizable menu, and a decent price, all close to my house is a receipt for a good restaurant choice! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed, and certainly wouldn't recommend. 

The restaurant was completely empty aside from one other table that already had their food. The waitress was inattentive and the food took much longer than it should. 

The soup was extremely salty, and all of the entrees were over sauced and flavorless. 

I was hoping for a new regular Thai place, but this is certainly not it."}
{"text":"I ordered food to be delivered, the wait time was short no more then 30 mins but I did order around 6:30-7pm. I ordered Mongolian beef spicy level medium, it's not like your usual Mongolian beef it definitely had a different flavor, not a bad one just not what I had expected. Even though it was only spicy level medium it still had a kick and I like spicy so for those who can't handle too much spice stick with mild or just eat it with white rice. We also ordered chicken chow mein which was good very flavorful and packed with veggies. Last we ordered Thai tea which had its own little carrier and they even taped the top so it would spill through the straw hole, I appreciate the little things :) good for a week night dinner when you don't feel like cooking"}
{"text":"Our office orders food here at least once a weekfor the past year..Food is consistently great, and I have tried many different thai places - this one tops them all. Yes, you do have to wait a bit sometimes because this is a smallish place with one chef but food is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Gotten take out from here twice and I'm definitely a fan. About $16 for spring rolls and chicken pad thai and I swear they give you enough for at least 2 meals.

They only have one phone line and during dinner hours they are busy. The pad thai has great flavor and decent portion of chicken. The peanut sauce alone will keep bringing me back here. 

The inside to me seems very old fashioned authentic thai. It's dark and homey, good date spot or with groups too. Employees are friendly and attentive.

Never have had to wait on my food. Perfect takeout place! Yay!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch - it was busy but we still got seated quickly. I ordered the #2 - stirfry vegetables with tofu. They ask how spicy you would like it on a scale of 1-5. I got a 2.5, which wasn't bad at all. For the price of just under $10, you get your lunch dish, soup, and iced tea - a pretty good combo deal. They also give you a pitcher of tea for the table so you have it at your disposal! Quick service and decent food."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai restaurant quite close to downtown. Gets very busy during weekday lunch, so plan on waiting for a table to clear up unless you get there early.

While I have tried a number of Thai dishes, I have come to only order the green curry chicken unless if I absolutely feel like getting something else. The green curry here is thick and flavorful - they really spice it up, even for a 4*, so be careful as to what level of spice you wish to order."}
{"text":"Best Pud Thai in town! And I've tried a lot! I always get take out and my experience is always wonderful. The service is extremely fast and friendly. Thank you Thai Taste!"}
{"text":"Cozy, quaint atmosphere, perfect for a date.  Their Pad Thai is much better than most other places I have frequented.  The chicken soup hot pot is fun to share and the broth is hearty and much more satisfying than a first glance suggests.  Finally, the Panang curry with chicken is a truly awesome experience.  Spicy but not overpowering and the basil really comes through.  

Service is friendly, if slightly challenged when it gets crowded.  But as opposed to most western style settings, any server will help you get what you need, such as water, chopsticks, the bill, etc.  Highly recommended.  

The chicken satay can be a little dry.  The chicken dumplings have changed recently.  They used to be gyoza style but lately are shumai.  And when the menu says fried, they mean deep fried, not pan fried.  The lettuce wraps have the meat and vegetable filling already mixed in with the mung bean (crunchy white) noodles so it loses its flavor.  That's the first thing they've gotten wrong.  But everything else has been just right."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. Kana Mhoo Krop is my family's favorite dish. Pad Thai is good also. Haven't ventured further then this dishes. Had others just not very memorable good but not holy shit this is great. We have returned a few times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Love Thai Taste. I have tried both University & East Blvd locations. The food is fresh, flavorful and delish!! The only complaint I have is that the university location is the only one who makes papaya salad (my absolute favorite Thai dish)! Truly authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I did not find Thai taste anything special. I ordered vegetable Pad Thai. There were only a couple of pieces of broccoli and no other visible vegetables. There were a several pieces of tofu. The flavor was very bland. They offer spice preferences  on a scale of 1-5. I did ask for a #1. 
My adult son ordered shrimp Pad Thai (scale of 3 in spiciness)which he thought was just \"eh\".
We were there at 6:00p.m , the restaurant was busy, but our server did a great job.
The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere. Overall Thai Taste is not bad, just underwhelming."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I am still looking for the experience that other Yelpers are raving about. I am not a Thai food expert by any means, but the dishes that I have had here are underwhelming flavor-wise and generally do not live up to expectations. This includes the pad thai, pad see ew, yellow curry and basil mushroom cashew stir fry. I will say that the help is friendly and helpful and the interior provides a fun Thai restaurant atmosphere.

I do not suggest this as a dining option and will only go if a large group of friends has decided this is the only option for a meal out together and I cannot convince them otherwise."}
{"text":"I have been in CLT for seven years, I went to Thai Taste numerous times and loved it.  Then I went one time and wasn't too impressed, so I kind of wrote it off.  I went last night and ordered C-3 (red curry chicken with pineapple.) Come on you didn't know what C-3 was????  I  ordered it level 3 spicy out of 5.  It was perfect.  Sometimes dishes are never spicy enough.  I woke up this morning thinking maybe I should have my leftovers for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had Shrimp Pad Thai here...order 3/10 spice , should have got the 5/10.  Needed just a little more zip.  Shrimp were large and cooked perfectly, great flavor , superior friendly service from girl at the counter as I walked in and ordered to go.  I will defenitely return !"}
{"text":"This place is good. I have eaten here a few times and never had anything bad. The curry is good and they can change the spice. Behind the counter guy is super nice and helpful with menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places to eat. The cashier / waitress makes you feel comfortable & she's very friendly .. If you go here try the Tom Yum so delicious the taste is nothing compared to any other Thai place. I also love their goyza so delicious as well. Also recommend the garlic chicken over rice & Thai Teas are perfect! I love everything about this place ! The decor is a little out dated but I love this place . It's the best Thai food literally in Vegas everything is fresh !"}
{"text":"I had been craving for some Thai food ever since I went to Thai Takeout in Dilworth (it's great Thai food, please see my separate review). But I thought I tried someplace else. 

What I like best about Thai Taste is their dining area decor. It's very exotic and traditional looking, as if you walked into Thailand. The bright red moldings on the ceiling and the elephant pattern tablecloths are a couple cool examples.

For dinner I had the Gaeng Dang, a seafood combination, red curry sauce in coconut cream with green peas, bamboo shoot, chili, string beans, basil leaves, scallops, shrimp and squid. It like Christmas in a curry plate! 

The coconut milk blended in with the red curry seamlessly (and I am NOT a coconut fan) Paired along side with jasmine rice, the meal was absolute perfection! 

The service was great and I my wait was for less than five minutes, which was a pleasant surprise. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My Thai-craving days have ceased to be numbered and Thai Taste came up on my radar for a lunch visit with a buddy this week. Happily obliged an early lunch and we certainly beat the impending crowd that tends to form right around lunchtime proper. 

The lunch menu is very quaint. About 7 options that can all be tailored for choice of protein, veggies, level of spice and other accoutrement. Variations of pad thai, soups. rice dishes and mixed veggies. I settled on the pad thai and was thrilled with the result. Baby bok choy, bean sprouts, rice noodles, a spring roll and a delectable dipping sauce. It's a hefty portion for such a cheap lunch, too. I went with 2-star spice and was happy I did. It cleared my sinus cavity with ease. 

My #1 recommendation: order the hot tea. Especially on a cold day. It's a simple oolong/citrus tea that works so well with the food. I'm stoked to come back and order the tea again. 

The service is super friendly, fast, and fun. They were attentive throughout our meal. 

Though the menu isn't vast for lunch, I'd like to come back in for dinner sometime soon. 

Cheer, Thai Taste!"}
{"text":"Very very slow.  First time here.  Figured I would give it a try since it's a block from my house.  Been waiting 40 minutes for my take out order....still waiting.  Wish I would have read the reviews first...."}
{"text":"First experience with Thai food and it was great! Got the pad Thai with chicken spicy level 2, wasn't THAT spicy but really good. I think I paired it with a weird wine having no experience so maybe ask about that?"}
{"text":"Love this place.. lunch is the real rocket here.. choice of entree comes with this crispy egg roll, broth to start and a drink for around 10 bucks."}
{"text":"As I walked in from the North Carolina heat, that wonderful spicy and sweet smell wafted in my face! Now I've been to Thailand and I'm always disappointed by Thai food in America. But the smell hit me and I almost thought I was back in Thailand! As I was seated I glanced at the menu and already new what I wanted! I ordered the chicken Pad Thai I instantly asked how spicy can I get it? The woman said 5! I said let's do it! Her look on her face was that of surprise. She brought me a pitcher of water after I placed my order. Moments later I was delivered a tofu and rice soup. Which was delicious once I added some spicy pepper sauce. Before I new it my main dish was in front of me! The cabbage roll was so light and fluffy as if the angles had prepared it themselves! As I took a bite of the Pad Thai I was pleased! This was some of the best Thai that I have had in the States! As the flavors waltz on my tastebuds a little sweat started to roll off my forehead I wasn't sure if it was the heat index from the Charlotte atmosphere or if it was my dish?! Either way I have found my new Thai place for sure! This is a must try if you are ever in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great food! The Tom Yum soup is delicious as is the Pad Thai. Great place for take out or a last minute bite to eat."}
{"text":"I should give Thai Taste 3 stars because 3 is where the waitress cut me off on the heat level of my curry.

Waitress: Would you like it spicy?  1-5?
ML: 4.
Waitress: 3 would be better [walking away].

True story.  But I wouldn't dream of giving the Double T anything less than 4 stars.  The chicken dumplings were really good, and my curry was exactly what I was looking for (maybe 25% less spicy?).  The service was also good, even considering the affront to my manliness.

We'll visit T^2 again - probably weekly until the waitress doesn't bat an eye when I order my curry at a 5.  I'm wishing we'd ordered double just so I'd have something for a late night snack.  Besides, two 3 curries = 6 overall, right?  And that would be like the 11 on the volume dial of Spinal Tap's amps, right?  Right?  Boo-yah!"}
{"text":"Take out service is a bit slow, but it is absolutely worth your time. I've eaten in the dimly lit restaurant a few times but I find I really enjoy Thai Taste best on my couch at home. The pad Thai is delicious  and they always give hearty portions. Parking can be difficult at times. Waiters and staff are pleasant and always offer recommendations. Yummy restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fast, well-priced, no-frills.

They bring you soup as a starter as part of their service and the food comes out so fast it will make your head spin. Great for a quick lunch option. Our office is one street over, so we walk over here every now and then.

Good flavors - again - nothing posh, but simple and tasty.

Another plus, is there is hardly ever a wait - you get seated right away. 

Noodles, Pho, Soups, Curry etc. You will find it here."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Great lunch specials. They have never gotten my order wrong. This is a little gem in dilworth; don't blink or you'll miss it!"}
{"text":"Great service great Thai food  especially pineapple fried rice.My son and I comes in at least once a week for lunch special $5.99"}
{"text":"I really don't care if the food from this establishment is good.  After walking in and ordering fried rice,  pad kee mao, and red curry we sat for 45 minutes for our togo order.  Thai taste could have the best food on the planet, but I will never again order from this restaurant.

To be fair the curry and pad kee mao were pretty tasty, however the fried rice barely qualified as fried...
Service was friendly.

I still will not patronize this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"Raining? Thai Taste. Snowing? Thai Taste. Exhausted/Hungover? Thai Taste. 
I literally don't *need* a reason to grab to-go from this restaurant, but I convince myself to go at least once a week. Bonus: I have the same order as Luke Kuechly (Chicken Pad Thai Two Star Spicy) and that makes me feel cool."}
{"text":"Wasn't the worst Thai I've ever had, also wasn't the best. Parking here during busy hours is a nightmare so be prepared."}
{"text":"De-freaking-lish-ious. Hands down the best Thai food I've had in CLT. Great lunch specials. Quaint place."}
{"text":"$ 5.95 lunch specials ! I usually order the basil chicken that comes with a side of steamed rice, egg roll, and a refreshing salad. I ordered a 7 on the spice level-- and it was perfect for me. Anything more, and I wouldn't have been able to feel my face.

The staff is friendly, and the food comes out relatively quickly.  This is important to me since I only have an hour lunch break. There are better Thai places in town, but few offer better value for your money."}
{"text":"Thai Taste is my 2nd favorite on my list when I'm in desperate need of Thai food. I go here with my best friend all the time. They remember what I ordered from the 1st time I came. I promised myself to try something new every time I come yet manage to order THE SAME THING EVERY SINGLE TIME. 
Robin and I ordered the Koon Gra Bok as an appetizers which is marinated shrimp wrapped in egg roll shells, deep fried served with their sweet and sour sauce. Omg. I'm in love. I mean comon now, it's deep fried. It has a nice crunch to it. Remind me of the fried spring rolls my mom make at home. Delicious!!! For dinner or lunch I alway go with C-2, the chicken Mussamun curry with coconut milk, onions, potatoes and peanuts. Alway alway NON spicy because I can't take anything spicy. I like it, very favorable, nice curry kick without the hurting your nose or eyes while eating it. It finish with a nice crunchy peanuts topping. I have tried the Pud Thai which is very famous there. Is ok, a little to sweet for me. I also liked their pineapple fried rice but wish they can add Chinese sausages. I would like this dish even more. 
Staffs there are alway nice. They remember people and what their ordered which is crazy to me. I like coming in and see the familiar faces. They get our food to the table quick, good customer services and always on point. I will and have been back..."}
{"text":"We have visited this place for dinner.we have ordered the spring rolls and chicken fried rice.spring rolls were perfect and good.the chicken fried rice was good but the best I have eaten from Thai restaurents they can make it better with Thai flavours.overall it's a good visit"}
{"text":"One of the best thai places in Vegas. I always feel welcomed in the restaurant. Has great lunch and dinmer specials. The dinner special says it feed 2 but four of us ate it with leftovers. It also has the best green tea ice cream I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in town! I love their curry dishes and their noodle dishes.. I dream about their food when their hungry, it's that good! You can tell all the food is made from scratch and is very tasty. Try the red curry with Shrimp or the wide noodles fish with shrimp, they are so delicious! 

Best Thai food I ever had! Yummmm"}
{"text":"I really want to like Thai Taste since its so close to home.  I had tried my go to Thai dish here twice prior and was not impressed (pad see ew), so I thought maybe its just this one dish.  So this time I ordered shrimp fried rice and tom kha soup.  The veggies and chicken in the soup were good, but the only flavor that really stood out was the sweetness of the coconut milk.  Same with the fried rice, it lacked flavor.  I had similar issues on my previous visits with the noodles.  However the people have always been really friendly and the ingredients are fresh so please don't shy away because of my review.  I'm picky when it comes to my Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai Taste is great for take out. In my opinion Basil is a little better but the prices at Thai taste are so much more reasonable. My go to is chicken red curry. The heat scale here is reasonable. So no need to scale down. My husband got the fried rice and loved how it wasnt overly greasy."}
{"text":"Thai Taste has the best Thai cuisine in Charlotte.  It's a neighborhood spot with great food.  Known for the pad thai, there are other delicious options too.  The soups are good, as are the sweet & sour dishes, the basil rolls, and the ginger dish.  The servers are really kind and get to know the customers who frequent the restaurant."}
{"text":"I first ordered from this restaurant a few weeks ago and I ordered again tonight their food is delicious delivery is prompt and prices are reasonable. Egg rolls are great and so is the Pad Thai-extra spicy. I'm about to try - you won't believe it green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm amazed at how delicious the food is. I haven't had a let down with anything I've ordered to this day. Thai chicken is up there with my favorites and the soup they serve you with dinner, out of this world. I've been guilty of walking over and getting the large order to go. It's a great quick lunch if I don't really have a break and I'm hungry."}
{"text":"So the ambience isn't the greatest and the servers will never look you in the eye (or even close to at you), and their beer menu isn't the greatest.  Though screw it.  Everything else about this place is great.  I started with an app of the dumplings.  Nothing special, but not bad.  Though, when I got my pad thai I was amazed that my 80lb server could carry such a big dish.  DAAAYUUUM they give you a lot of food.  For 13.95 for the seafood combiantion it is a steal.  They ask you how spicy you want you want your food (1-5).  I went with three and I am glad I did.  I think 4 or 5 would have been to much, but like goldilocks i am slut and 3 was just right. I finished this up with a Thai ice tea which was spot on.  Looking for an authenitc nothing fancy thai place?  This is your spot."}
{"text":"Ive been going here for years. Hands down the best Thai in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants is Thai Taste in Las Vegas.  Their food always tastes like a treat to me (my favorite on their menu is the Pad Thai Chicken). The Egg Rolls are delicious and I'm drooling just thinking about their Egg Foo Young. This family run restaurant is welcoming and has always provided my family with excellent service."}
{"text":"When your curry is sweeter than your Thai iced tea, you have a problem.  Here's a news flash: Thai food isn't supposed to be this sweet.  My friends and I went on a recommendation from a business partner.  I should have known that it was a bad recommendation after we took said business partner to Thai Grill, and he refused to try the larb...

We ordered the Kana mhoo krop (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and ouster sauce - 7.95), pad see ew 6.95, pineapple curry 7.95, and Tom kha gai 8.95.  I also had a Thai iced tea that was pretty good.  It wasn't overly sweet or creamy, and perhaps on the lighter side when compared to a lot of Thai restaurants.  

The tom kha gai wasn't too bad.  It had a lot of chicken, spices, galanga, and mushrooms.  I ordered it with extra lime juice, and medium spice.  It came out fairly bland though, and we had to add chili paste to it, which made it a lot better.  I wouldn't say it impressed me though.

Next up was the pad see ew, a standard Thai noodle dish, with beef.  The beef was nicely prepared, and the Chinese broccoli was sufficiently fresh.  The sauce had a little added sugar, but not too much to make it gross.  It was an OK dish, nothing grand or uniquely characteristic other than the added sweetness.

The Kana mhoo krop was something I had never tried before, and I wish I could have tried it at a better restaurant.  The oyster sauce was ridiculously salty.  The pork was fried in little slices, making it very tough almost like a thick bacon.  It wasn't particularly good quality, which didn't matter anyway because all I could taste was salt.  The only potential redeeming quality was that this dish had an overload of Chinese broccoli. Unfortunately though, this dish just plain sucked.

The worst dish was the pineapple curry.  In the words of one of my work colleagues, \"Yuck.\"  This was probably the sweetest curry I've ever had.  That's all I have to say about that.

This is some of the most Americanized, and grossest Thai food in town."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say it, but I have to take away a star. I went back to Thai Taste and ordered the Pad Thai again and was greatly disappointed. The noodles were mushy. In addition, I had many bites that tasted like I was eating out of a peanut butter jar. My hope is that they were having a rough night; however, I will probably hesitate before I return.

The service, on the other hand, was very friendly and attentive and my drink never ran out!"}
{"text":"Cute, cozy, great atmosphere, and amazing food!!! You can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Has a very homey feel to it, and great for a date, dinner party, or get-together with a group of friends. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often. From what I understand, it's really authentic Thai, too."}
{"text":"First tine here. Had their daily special Thai Taste Chicken, which was crispy chicken breast pieces over broccoli and lettuce. The key here was that the chicken WAS crispy. And tender! And DELICIOUS! A little more sweet than heat but enough heat to cause the occasional sniffle.

I just had to also order their house Fried rice. I opted for beef as I already had a chicken dish. This was decent but not nearly as good as the chicken dish. I had to add a little soy sauce to bring out the flavors. But it WAS good. I guess I've eaten at so many great Thai places around the Continent that my expectations were a tad higher.

One criticism is the lack of a decent wine list! With Asian food they should have some semi sweet whites by the glass to choose from. They didn't, unless you count White Zin in that category. I don't. A simple Cali Riesling or German Spatlese would work.

Overall Thai Taste did not disappoint! I will definitely be back to try their more traditional Pad Thai dishes that everyone raves about! Based on what I had I'd definitely recommend Thai Taste."}
{"text":"I have a slight addiction to Thai Taste.  And by slight I actually mean I could eat it every single day.  

Nestled in a little corner off of East Blvd (attached to Paper Sky Scrapers) this is by far the best Thai place in Charlotte.  

The food comes out fast, it is reasonably price, not to mention mouth watering!

The wait staff is sweet and the guy behind the counter always calls me \"love\" so I like the place even more.

The place is lovely!  If you like Thai you will absolutely LOVE Thai Taste.

The Red Curry is a game changer.  I get it every time (and dream about it at night)!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Lots of people I know call this their go to Thai place.  It's like the McDonalds of Thai food.  We took bites of our entrees after being disappointed by our appetizers, paid the check, and went to another restaurant to have dinner. 

To start, the pad Thai recipe appears to be boxed noodles, ketchup and a few stingy pieces of chicken. Nothing but red noodles on a plate. It's like what I'd call Thai to my 3 year old if i was making it at home and was for some reason forced to make him eat Thai food. 

Pad see ew was equally bland and devoid of the veggies that are part of the dish. Boiled noodles with some chicken tossed on top and a shake of soy sauce. I mean.... I could do better in a dorm room with a hot plate. 

The apps tasted like they came from a box frozen and heated in the microwave. Trader Joe's has better offerings. 

There is definitely a void of good Asian and Thai offerings in Charlotte, but how this place stays in business is a mystery to me."}
{"text":"I have moved out of Charlotte now... But I still miss this place ... The pad Thai ... Is my fav..."}
{"text":"I came here today to take advantage of their lunch specials. I ordered the Gaeng Panang with chicken and jasmine rice. All lunch specials come with a spring roll, ice tea and a bowl of cabbage broth soup! With the chicken added, it was $8.95, but you can also opt for a combination platter (chicken + beef) or seafood for a slight up charge. They also had pud thai that looked delicious, but I'm a sucker for the curry and coconut milk...

The soup was light and delicious. Tasted very similar to chicken noodle soup and had bits of tofu in it. The spring roll was a great little touch and the dipping sauce was a nice compliment. But, the Gaeng Panang was bomb! It had the right amount of sweetness and spice to it- even though I added some extra red pepper oil to it. It definitely hit the spot - I think it beat Basil Thai's green curry, which I also love.

All in all, my husband and I had lunch for under $20 here and left satisfied. I wish they had lunch specials on the weekend as it can get a little pricy here during dinner ($15-18/dish). However, I would definitely return. The pud thai is next on my list!"}
{"text":"After a day at the park I was really hungry and not in the mood for the usual fare on East blvd. so I trekked up to Thai Taste. Walking inside it was the usual traditional Thai decor. The restaurant was small and cozy, but I imagine if I had went at a busier time it might have just felt crowded.

The menu is laid out so you pick your entrée and combo it with choice of meat. I went for the green curry with chicken. Usually when I have green curry it has a decent kick to it due to the paste being made from green chilies and balances out the sweetness of the coconut. This green curry while pretty aromatic seriously lacked some much needed heat. After reading some reviews on here though I'll probably try it again and request it extra hot.

The prices are pretty reasonable and the service is attentive enough to keep my water glass full which is much appreciated! My meal arrived in a very timely manner and I left full and happy. Probably one of the better Thai places I've been to in Charlotte, I'll have to come back and try out their Pad Thai along with a hopefully spicier green curry."}
{"text":"Solid food. Had the shrimp pad thai and spring rolls, both were pretty good. Nice sized portions for the price."}
{"text":"I've eaten at about 40-50 thai restaurants. Seriously...

This one is par. I totally love the Thai Taste in Spartanburg, SC. So, my expectations were a bit high. They aren't owned by the same guy although they are cousins.  The atmosphere is nicer than monsoon down the steet, but if you'd like better food. I would check out monsoon."}
{"text":"This is the best place in town to get Thai food.  The atmosphere is quiet and dark, but the service is very friendly.  The pud thai is fabulous, so is the red curry with coconut milk and pineapples.  If you go at lunch you get to choose from about 7 different dishes, each served with a spring roll."}
{"text":"In the past probably would have said 4 stars, but I grabbed some chicken Pad Thai to go the other night after being delayed on a flight for over 2 hours.  All I could think of as I left the airport was getting some hot, delicious noodles, but 10 minutes later when I got home and dug in, I realized it was blah.  It was really dried out, the chicken wasn't good, kinda tough and dry.  It was a large portion though and my order was ready w/in 5 minutes of calling them.  Probably an off night, so I will go back as I've been very happy in the past."}
{"text":"I like Thai food.  I LOVE Thai Taste.

BEST THAI IN CHARLOTTE!

I took a friend here for lunch and it was great.  I love it when a restaurant does not try to make up for average food with excessive decor...Thai Taste is your basic bare bones, lacking on style, but OH is the food ever so tasty, restaurant!

I got the curry chicken - I think it is called Gang Pang ? ;) and I got it with 4 of 5 stars heat - could have gone hotter but it would have made me sweat.  The only thing I wish was that they served about half a scoop of rice more with your dish - ran out on the last three or four bites of main dish - no biggy.

Lunch was served quickly, waters came out even faster with an extra pitcher of water for the table - nice touch.

I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai spot in Charlotte. Their pad see ew is my go to but their pad Thai is incredible too. Try the scallops if you're a fan. They haven't disappointed thus far."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious! Highly recommended and priced more than fair! Great spot for locals, and you will feel like you're in Thailand!!"}
{"text":"Found me a new Thai place...just wish it wasn't an hour away. The Thai Garlic Beef with extra sauce is delicious"}
{"text":"This is the only time I have ever felt deceived by a high star number on Yelp.  My husband and I were walking around Southend pub hopping, and when it was time for dinner we pulled out the 'ol Yelp app and found this place right around the corner and with a solid four star rating.  We LOVE thai food, and we know that it is always a good option for vegetarians in unknown restaurant areas.  Unfortunately we were completely underwhelmed.

The restaurant itself is really cute - lots of wood paneling, Thai themed decor and paintings, wood tables and chairs.  The staff was also very friendly.  That's about where anything resembling four starts ends for me.  I ordered the Pad Thai as I have found this to be steadily good in the twenty or so other Thai restaurants I have eaten at around the country.  Here, it tasted like it was mixed up with a weird sweet and sour sauce.  Pad Thai should not be sweet.  At all.  They also did not give us the option for hotness levels, which I didn't think of until after we ordered, so our food came out very mild.  My husband ordered the Pad Woon Sen, which while better than my Pad Thai, was still unimpressive.  I left disappointed with a sticky sweet taste in my mouth.

If this had come up on the app as a three star restaurant, our experience would have been much more explainable.  Hopefully the food is better other times, though what was coming out to other tables looked much like what we were served so I don't know.  I would give the ambiance, location and service a four, but the food a one or two.  I can't give this place a three star review, because I really don't feel that it's \"A-ok\".  So we'll go with the two star \"Meh, I've experienced better\", because that's exactly how I feel."}
{"text":"Nice lunch specials and great quality food. I recommend for lunch just add their sugar water to your tea ;)"}
{"text":"Lived in Chicago and LA for the past eight years and this place is better than any Thai restaurants I experienced in those cities.  On top of that, the staff is super friendly, knowledgeable (since I'm sometimes indecisive), and always asks me how spicy I want it.  A+"}
{"text":"The worst Thai food I've ever had. I splurged to have delivery through Door Dash having tried the Pad Thai once a few years ago, I thought I would give them another try. We ordered a vegetarian Pad Thai, the Mussamun Curry, steamed rice, and the Tom Kha. The Pad Thai was simply disgusting, the portion is large but it tasted like watered-down bad fish sauce. It's also a very strange red color, must different from any Pad Thai I've had elsewhere. The curry was decent but quite bland and definitely had no spice, fortunately the rice was well cooked. The Tom Kha was also bland yet bad tasting and had large chunks of tomato, which I found very odd. Overall, this was a really disappointing meal."}
{"text":"In over 8 years I've never gone inside the restaurant. The food is delicious, fast delivery and courteous staff i love the place!"}
{"text":"This place is never open...EVER!!!!!!!  It's really good food and I was really looking forward to eating there...but they are always CLOSED!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only best Thai food restaurant I have ate. Customer service is amazing and the restaurant is very clean. The wait time is fair. However the food is phenomenal! I recommend everyone to eat here."}
{"text":"I came for dinner because I was craving Pad Thai and because this place has been around for so long and I have never tried it, I decided to. The staff was very friendly and seated as soon as I walked in. 
I ordered a Thai tea which was really good, I don't think you can really mess that up. I also ordered Fresh Basil rolls as an appetizer and Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai.
The Fresh Basil rolls were probably the biggest rolls I've ever had so 1 roll was probably all I needed but it came with 2. I don't remember if it had shrimp in the roll which usually comes in the roll when I've ordered at other places. The peanut sauce was good. 
 The Pad Thai was ok. I believe the rice noodles were too thin and mushy for my liking. The portion was huge and I could barely eat half of the plate. 

I think this place is more of a lunch time stop. I've heard they have a great lunch special."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch special, which I highly recommend. You get the same portions as dinner but for a cheaper price. Comes with entree option, tea and an egg roll. 

If you like Thai food, they have all the great options. You really can't go wrong with any of them. Just let your server know what you like or don't like and they'll be able to point you in the right direction. 

Also, let them know if you want your entree spicy with some heat. I think they do none - 4 or 5. But if you really like things hot let them know you like it 'Thai' hot and not 'American' hot, LOL... there is a difference. 

They also have really good Thai tea, it's extra and not included in the free drink price, but completely worth it to try. It's similar in taste to chai tea but a little different, comes to you cold (it's not a hot tea, kind of the consistency of bubble tea without any boba). 

Service was great, was in and out in probably 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The cashier/waitress was the best element of our dining experience. She's very friendly and welcoming. Mixed reviews on the food: I loved the yellow curry and will be back for it. Pad thai didn't blow me away, and we also ordered a salad with shrimp-- the shrimp were big and looked good, but the salad wasn't my fav. Definitely coming back since the yellow curry was amazing, and it's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Definelty my local favorite Thai restaurant.  This is a lunch time magnet close to downtown.  Come early and expect to wait a few minutes.  The #1 beef with coconut, yellow curry, at level 3 heat is just dumb delicious.  WARNING, level 4 is spicy and level 5 is painful!!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad really not at all it just...was OK. I loved the freshness, quick order and delivery but I was not Wowed...."}
{"text":"This place is not that great but it delivers so I have ordered from here a few times. 

The pad see ew is pretty good.  I also like the pinapple fried rice - it's well spiced but not over spiced.  

I've gotten the panang curry a few times and it has been hit or miss ranging from decent to bad - sometimes its just overloaded with sugar.  The tom ka gai is ok but there are large pieces of galangal and ginger that you need to pick out every bite.

My fav Thai in town is Lotus of Siam ( http://tinyurl.com/l8hr9w ) , and if I don't feel like driving clear across town, Archi's or PIn Kao are decent enough."}
{"text":"Never again. I absolutely LOVE Thai and was thrilled to find a local spot not too far from my new condo... however,  my excitement was short lived. We ordered crab rangoons, chicken satay, green beef curry and shrimp pad thai... where do I even start?!! First off, the crab rangoons had no undetectable crab and only a hint of cream cheese, the chicken satay was flavorless and tough, the beef curry was an odd consistency with a sad amount of meat and to top off this unfortunate meal, the shrimp on the pad thai was DISGUSTING! It tasted muddy and had absolutely NO seasoning. I tried to explain to the server about the flavor of the shrimp and she wanted to stand there and explain how the shrimp come frozen from the vendor... I could not care less where it came from lady IT'S GROSS! I kept telling her to have the cook make one yo taste and she just looked at me like no one was home. I honestly thought I was going to get sick from eating the one. I am totally bummed that I had such a horrible experience... the search for local Thai continues."}
{"text":"We went Saturday evening this place was packed, service was extremely slow, you could tell people were getting frustrated waiting on their drink order, food and check. We sat close to the kitchen, even had one lady come ask about their food they had been waiting awhile. It was weird we sat after two two people tables, we got our drink order before them and even ordered our food. Then they got theirs we sat 10 minutes after them, one table got their food before us, but yet the other table did not they didn't get theirs until we were half done with ours, kinda weird. Food was phenomenal, can't complain at all, we got spring rolls as an app, the a pineapple curry dish and chicken fried rice, both delicious. All in all it was a great night service is just extremely slow!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on our first night in Charlotte. I got the vegetable and tofu plate and it was really good! My friend ordered something that was much better- the fried tofu and bean noodles plate. 

Our waitress asked how much heat we wanted on a scale of 1 to 5; I said 3 and I am glad I did. I like spice, and 3 was just hot enough to taste good but not so hot that I was uncomfortable. I would probably order again, especially since they deliver!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while. I ordered the 36.  With sliced chicken. I ordered it Thai Native Spicy and got the Thai Tea as backup. Just in case. They got the spice perfect.
This place is very cozy and reminds me of the mom and pop places in Hong Kong. The portions are plentiful and the prices are reasonable.
This was one of the first places that I had taken my wife when we were dating all those years ago. It was her first experience with Thai food and she just loves the Summer rolls and Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Awesome Thai food ever! I think this is best Thai restaurant in town. Waitress are polite and very helpful, they took time to recommend me each plate in menu. Then I got curry and duck meat and padthai. Then Thaitea are never ever better, prices are reasonable. Ah one more thing! You should try Thai coffee! It's a bit like Vietnamese coffee but better! But they don't have papaya salad, so we ordered beef salad up to manager suggested, it's not a bad choice at all! We definitely enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"YUMMY Thai food- when we go- we get the pad see ew (sooo good) , red curry (you want to lick to plate) and the hot pot of tom yum which is so freakin good- always super hot which is how it tastes best. My favorite thai restaurant in Clt by far."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Las Vegas for business for a couple of years. This tiny restraunt is big on wonderful service and amazing delicious food. I think it is Las Vegas' best kept secret!!

They been open for 7 days a weeks for a past 30 years since 1988 ! First Thai Restaurant in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. I ordered veg food via door dash. They delivered incorrect food. When I called the restaurant, they not even cared to understand the issue and simply hung up saying deal with door dash."}
{"text":"Thai Taste is good. It's not amazing, but it's the best Thai food I've found in Charlotte. 

It's a great place to go for lunch. It can be packed, but with the cheap, fast lunch specials, they get you in and out quickly. You sit down at the table and soup magically arrives in front of you before you've even ordered. 

Some call it boring, but I really love Thai fried rice and I tend to get that along with an order of chicken satay. Both are pretty good and filling. I've always got leftovers to take home and enjoy for another meal."}

{"text":"I went to this place after a B-cycle ride around Dilworth and the greenway. It's a cute little restaurant! The prices are a bit high on some dishes but they give you so much food that it kind of balances out. The service was good and the dining room clean. I wouldn't say any of the food blew me out of the water but it definitely was not bad and if in the area and craving pad thai, I would go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I really had a taste for Thai food one night looked on Yelp everybody was closed.
This is MY GO TO PLACE NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"OH BOY....I had to rate it 3 star on the wait time for dine-in, it was actually more like a zero but that wouldn't be fair. We were on a lunch break and it took a full hour to just get our food which then we had to take to go... I still can't tell you what it taste like I'm sure it's good but don't go eat dine-in unless you have a lot of time to kill and are not really hungry.  However, I picked a 3 instead of zero because the food was really good once I was able to eat it... So just have it delivered or pre-order and you should be good"}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to check out if you love Thai food. 

Authentic. 

The food is bursting with flavor, great prices and a calming environment around you while you eat. You get a lot for what you pay for. I can never finish my meal completely when I eat here. 

Only thing I do have to say is that the service could be friendlier. My waitress maybe says two things to me whenever I come here."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of our go-to Thai restaurants.  The dishes are all delicious and the service is quick.  

I highly recommend the Pra Rarm Long Song and the Mee Krob."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Thai Taste for lunch. They're lunch specials are fast and cheap, and that's usually what I'm looking for. It's not the best Thai food I've ever had, but it fulfills the Thai beast that sometimes rears its gruesome head in me and won't be satisfied with anything else.

I like the fried tofu appetizer, and I'm also partial to the Thai Iced Tea. If you haven't had that stuff, it's like a dessert in a glass. It's awesome. I'm not sure if it's authentic Thai fare or not, but it's yummy either way."}
{"text":"These guys takes an hour to cook your food.

Even if you order pick-up, they tell you it should be ready in 30 min, but NO! You arrive there in 30 mins, they still make you wait 15 mins or more. Time is money guys.

Good food, but the last straw was when they made us wait an hour and a half for our food. God we were hungry and pissed."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and its good. Not great but good. They have a very limited lunch menu, which is annoying, but the food is good.  Tonight I decided to order the delivery food. It has now been an hour and a half and no food. I have been charged (thank you online banking) but no food. When I called the guy said all the delivery orders have gone out and that it should be here soon.  Soon would have been at 8:30, only an hour after I ordered it. Now we are approaching 9:30, I'm starving and annoyed. I do not recommend ordering the delivery, ever!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place, but the flavors were underwhelming in the curry, and the chicken was dry.  I'd give it a second shot, but first experience was a bummer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast, friendly service. Beautiful Thai decor. Really good curries, noodles, and side dishes. 

I recommend for weekday lunches and for dinner any night."}
{"text":"This food was simply delicious. From previous reviews, I heard that lunch is the time to go due to the specials offered. Thanks fellow Yelppies as this was great advice. Had to wait on a table but they get em in and get em out pretty quickly. 

This was actually my first Thai experience and I think the bar has been set quite high. All the lunch specials (almost all under $10) come with soup, spring roll, rice, iced tea, and the entree. Bargain right there. Personal selection was Pud Thai with spicy level 3 out of 5.  Delicious all around. The portions are dinner size too!

I will return for sure, Thai after time."}
{"text":"I don't know what Jane is talking about... my roommate and I think the pad thai is delicious.  Add to that that this is one of the few places in the area that delivers, and you have a pretty decent thai restaurant in my opinion.  Just what I wanted on a Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Service  was a little sucky. The food was delicious and the price was right. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Get the red curry!  Didn't have too much time to explore the rest of the menu as I was grabbing a quick lunch but it's always nice to find a great Thai restaurant when I'm on the road. This hit the spot."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was delicious. Ordered the beef meatball noodle soup. Portion was large which makes up for the price. I like that it had veggies in it unlike some other soups I've had at other places."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is the best Thai in Charlotte.  Nothing too fancy, just a lot of the basics done consistently and without unnecessary frills.  This is like that little unassuming hole in the wall that you almost have to know about before you're willing to walk in and try it.  But once you do sit down, you know you've found a gem you'll come back to again.

Thai Taste has been around since my high school days, always in the same building, and I don't think the decor has changed one bit.  Neither has the menu, but then you don't go messing with a good thing.

Let me just say lunch is a much better value here than dinner- if for no other reason that you get a small bowl of a simple soup and a crispy spring roll served with a side of orange sauce, regardless of your entree choice.  Yes, it can be crowded at the height of lunch, but I've never had to wait long, even when people stand around outside the (only) door.  If you wait till 1 PM or beyond, you'll just about have the place to yourself.  The crowd is generally a mix of suits and the more casually dressed, with a few cops and the scrub-wearing hospital workers thrown in for good mix.  

The lunch menu is a much-abbreviated version of the dinner menu.  A single laminated page of about 8-10 dishes that each have a good, plain english description of what it is you are browsing.  Want a classic not on the menu?  Just ask- the menu does rotate by the day of the week so they will make just about anything for you if it is a traditional Thai dish.  

You get your choice of meat with each entree, which determines the price, or you can always choose to go vegetarian, which usually means tofu, though you can decline the same, as you can also decline eggs in the dish as well.  Here's my best tip- if you like Pad Thai (Pud Thai here, per the menu) get the vegetarian option if you like extra colorful veggies.  Lots more broccoli and carrots than if you order a meat.  Tofu is sauteed on the outside, but absorbs the wonderful peanut sauce that is the base of the dish.  Portions are always generous, so come hungry.

Un-sweet iced tea is included with every meal too, they'll usually bring a small pitcher for your table.  Here's my second tip- drink the tea, you'll need it if you like any advanced level of spice.  Coke and other soda is available, but it is served by the can and costs extra.  You already effectively paid for the tea in the price of the lunch, so drink it.

If I had one complaint, it is this- they ask you how spicy you like your dish and indicate the same using 1-5 \"stars.\"  In my experience, the only difference between 1 and 5 stars is the amount of red pepper flakes dumped on top of the finished product.  1 is to little, 5 is just too much.  With the number of Thai peppers and sauces available, I'd like to think we could do better here, but it's just not to be had here.

Note this restaurant now has other locations in both Matthews and University City.  Don't be fooled, the original still stands above the rest."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a year and a half and with my impending due date in sight I was determined to get some spicy food! We ordered the veggie spring rolls to start and while I wasn't a huge fan, the chili sauce they are served with is spectacular! I got the chicken pad see ew and omg! Best dish I've ever had!!!! I ordered it the first time at a \"2\" heat level and the second time- just a few days later at a \"3\"...; super amazing! If you are in the area and want to get some great food, stop by Thai Taste!!!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst pad Thai I've ever had. The flavor is terrible way too lemony not enough peanut. Weird after taste. I will not be going back to Thai taste for pad Thai. Don't let the looks of the photo deceive you, the taste is terrible. Terrible tastes."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times over the past couple of years and the food is awesome.  My favorite dish is pad woon sen.  I don't like my food too spicy, so I order it with two stars.  You need to make sure and mix up the dish as the hot spices are spooned on the top and you will want it evenly mixed.  The only reason that I give this place a 4-star rating rather than a 5-star is that I think that the prices are a little steep for me."}
{"text":"I have been fighting a terrible cold and I was in need of some hot tangy Thai soup.  I called the nearest Thai restaurant in the hood I was in and I was told the Tom Yum Kung with Chicken would be the best soup to get.

I placed the order to go but order took longer than promised. 25 min. instead of 15.

Chicken Satay was okay. 

Tom Yum Kung was good, it did hit the spot.

I also placed an order of Shrimp Pad Thai-yuk shrimp overcooked and it was bland.

Thai Ice Tea-very good.

Waitress brought out order to my car.

Sweet friendly service.

Okay place but will not be running back."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place multiple times, curious but have never stopped to try.  Came home today to a menu on our door and they offered delivery so we decided to give it a try!  We ordered pretty generic-chicken pad thai for me, shrimp pad thai for my husband.  We also ordered an appetizer of peanut satay and a side of sticky rice.  The pad thai was very good.  The chicken satay was tasty (the sauce was yummy) and it came with these spicy cucumbers that were so good! We would definately order from here again. There was a $2.00 delivery charge-totally worth it."}
{"text":"Been here for dinner once before, and it definitely satisfies the Thai food craving, but otherwise I think its just okay. The food is sort of bland tasting to me, and the inside is a bit on the skeevy side, but its otherwise festively decorated and seems to be a family-owned restaurant for the most part. I realize Charlotte doesn't have many different kinds of cuisine, so I suppose its good that they have places like Thai Taste for that occasional, yet inevitable craving for Thai (at least for some of us)."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Chicken Pud Thai here!!  It is really great!  
The staff are like robots and rarely speak to you but they do their job.

The decor looks like it is from the 70's along with the dust collection.  Then again, maybe that is adding to the taste making the food better."}
{"text":"Thai taste is indicative of ethnic restaurants in Charlotte--second rate. $13 gets you a small portion of shrimp pad Thai or an even smaller portion of gaeng dang (red coconut curry with chicken).

The red coconut curry is fine on taste, however the pad Thai is too dry, typical for this dish as it is difficult to make. Other restaurants provide a lemon wedge to cut the dry peanut flavor, not the case at Thai Taste. 

I love loving in Charlotte but it has a long way to go to shake itself of its white middle America populace that dictates the culinary industry.  There's no decent kabobs, Chinese, Thai or Indian here. Guess I was spoiled living in Northern VA."}
{"text":"Delicious shrimp fried rice. The best part to me was all of the extra sauces they have on the table, green (vinegar based), red (sweet), and hot pepper, to name a few. They have a few Eastern beers as well. Enjoyable place to eat, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Thai Taste I loved the food. Unfortunately this last trip made me less than impressed. Service was beyond slow and somewhat rude. The waitress cut us off to go assist another table mid sentence with a very curt wait a minute. We ordered the lettuce wraps and they tasted like pure ketchup. They were inedible and we sent them back. The pad thai was good, but was a little too sweet for my liking. I am unsure if I will return after this last experience."}
{"text":"Terrible Pad Thai, smelled and tasted awful. The yellow curry was super runny and definitely not up to par with some of the other places around here. Very disappointed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"When I need a quick lunch or low on cash, Thai Taste is definitely the first place I will think of. I wouldn't say they are an \"authentic Thai\" restaurant, but they are good. They have both Thai and Chinese dishes. The prices are amazing! Lunch specials are around $5.50 and they even include your drink. It comes with the typical entree, fried rice, soup, small salad, and egg roll. Its a small little hole in the wall place, but good food and great service. I recommend anyone trying it at least once."}
{"text":"So my hubby and I have been passing by this restaurant for a while and finally decided to try it out.

The food was incredible! We ordered the mint shrimp (which was so damn yummy), the orange chicken, shrimp chow mien, combination fried rice, shrimp wonton soup (we were on a shrimp roll), one day sun beef (which by all means was the bomb) and sticky rice. Everything was so delish. The one day sun came with the best sauce! 

I will definitely be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Yummy! This is my go-to takeout place. It became such a habit that I thought the guy answering the phone starting recognizing my name and order. I'd walk in and he'd immediately put the bag in front of me. Pad Thai with chicken. Spicy level 3. Spring rolls. I find it so hard to branch out from this wonderful combination. The Pad See Ew is also delightful...full of broccoli and thick noodles. I get it with beef. I wish I had time to take an actual lunch break from work so I could go there for their lunch specials, but take-out for dinner will have to do. Beware about the spice...it's not always consistent. I tend to get the 3, and the last time I got it my meal was barely spicy. Other times the level 3 has made my date cry. 

When I eat inside, I typically have a great experience...minus the one time like 8 years ago when a roach dropped onto my table. But nothing since then! The wait staff has always been friendly and everything seems clean. The food comes out quickly and hot and fresh. I will continue going back to That Taste!"}
{"text":"Pad see ew, a basic dish that is, oddly enough, seemingly difficult to get right. The food was flavorful and proportioned correctly but I'm hard pressed to find a Charlotte Thai restaurant that heats up the wok hot enough to properly flash sear the meats and vegetables in the traditional Thai fashion. Were this location not geographically undesirable, I would undoubtedly return for another try."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is okay.  The atmosphere is okay, the service is okay, the food is okay. It's one of the better more traditional Thai places in the area but I tend to prefer more americanized versions of Pad Thai. You can taylor each dish to the spice level you prefer. The menu has a nice variety."}
{"text":"Came in to get a few things for lunch. I usually judge a Thai place by their Pad See Ew. Got that and I guess they have a Chinese menu as well so I got the lemon chicken to try it out. Waited for what seemed like forever for the food, so now I am thinking, this is going to be some great food.
Not so much. They gave me orange chicken instead of lemon, which was not only the wrong thing but tasted like a bad version of Panda Express. 
Pad See Ew was ok but nothing special. Noodles could of been a little softer. 
Overall just subpar. I don't think I would ever come back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I tried their lunch out first instead of spending more on dinner. The food was ok, but not worth a return trip. 
I had the pad thai, which was cool for $7, but I would've been mad had I laid down $12 for that little plate at dinner. The spice rating, 1-5 stars, only correlates to the size of the mound of dried chili flakes they dump on top of your dish. That's just lazy; something cooks do for people who don't know better.
The thai iced tea is creamy and flavorful, but not as sweet as I'd like. I'm used to thai tea that's almost like a dessert. It was refreshing, but not heavenly.
My girl got a sad little beef and mushroom dish that had barely any flavor to the starchy sauce. It's not the worst joint in the world, and if I lived or worked very nearby I would probably frequent it, but it's definitely not worth a cross-town drive. If you really love Thai food, it's a pass."}
{"text":"For the price compared with what you get, you can do much better elsewhere. The Pad Thai is $10.95 and hardly had any beef in it, almost all noodles.Terrible beer selection; Michelob, Bud, Heineken, the usual suspects. The whole experience was meh, doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have gone out of my way to give a negative review. I went to dinner with a friend and we arrived around 730 on a Sunday. There was no order or system for how people were seated at tables. Once we placed our order, it was taking an unusually long time to receive our food so we asked if they had our appetizer ready. Over all it took over an hour and a half to get just the appetizer and then our actual meal came out about 15 minutes after. Another waitress came to our table and tried to tell us they had a lot of takeout orders, but three other tables who were sat after us already received their food and were leaving. When we spoke with a manager they said that only the appetizer was considered delayed and she would only discount that instead of discounting the meal even though everyone was served before us. There was clearly an issue with our order not being submitted but it was not admitted. I recommend not going there if you want good, fair service."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in Charlotte, hands down.  Their service is top notch and food is amazing."}
{"text":"I went here on a date and we started with the veggie spring rolls. They were the non-fried kind and were better than I was expecting (although more basil would have made them perfect). For an entree I had the Pad Prik Khing with Tofu and it was pretty good. You can do a spiciness rating of 1-5 so that helps adjust to your personal liking (I had a 3 and it was just the right amount of chili pepper). The staff split their tips so you get your food delivered to your table immediately and all of the waitresses were really good at making sure you had enough water."}
{"text":"The delivery is fast and reasonably priced. Food is always hott and delicious. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes thai."}
{"text":"We picked up from That Taste the other night, so I can't speak to eating at the restaurant (although the place was pretty packed with customers, even though it was very early on a Sunday night). What I can speak to is how the food tasted: great. 

My girlfriend got the curry (they offer three, and she chose the red curry over the yello and green curries), which came with rice, and it was really good. It did not, however, hold a candle to my selection, which was basic thai noodles with crispy duck. Maybe it's just because I LOVE duck, but this is one of the better dishes I've had in Charlotte in a long time. If you go there, order it. It was great--and only around $16, which is pretty good for any duck dish. Both dishes came with rice, and it was a lot of food: we had leftovers for at least two lunches. 

I will definitely go back to Thai Taste."}
{"text":"Thai Taste is one of my top 5 favorites in Charlotte, hands down. The food is always delicious, service is good, and the price is right (especially because I typically get two meals from one order). 

Parking can be a little hard to come by depending on the time of day, especially because the lot is shared by Paper Skyscraper customers. When it is busy, I tend to turn right on Euclid and pull in the back of the complex for a better shot at snagging an open spot. 

The ambiance of Thai Taste is dated, for lack of a better term, but honestly, you're not coming here for ambiance. You're coming here for an delicious meal. #37 is my go-to: Pra Rarm Long Song (Spinach). The homemade peanut sauce is heavenly. We've also tried quite a few of the curries and haven't gone wrong there, either. 

Can't wait to go back - writing this review already has me planning my next visit. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered thai iced tea, mee krob (they get points just for having it on the menu!) and pad kee mao a/k/a drunken noodles (not on the menu but the Lao waitress told me about it).

They ask for spice level from 1-5 so I requested a 4 which was PERFECT - I love my Pad Kee Mao to be super spicy and flavorful without being unbearably spicy.

The one thing that I was unhappy about was the lack of Lad Na on the menu :(  I need to find a place with authentic delicious Lad Na in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"So, I know this is 3 years later, but I felt the need to share my experience. I went in for my favorite Thai dish, Pad See Ewe, and had it to-go. When I got home I noticed that it had a grey look to it and an odd smell. The smell I can only compare to that of an elephant. I thought perhaps that this was more of a traditional Pad See Ewe or that maybe it had been cooked for too long. But, the cabbage was grey and the taste was nasty. I ate a few bites and threw it away. Why didn't I contact the restaurant about this? I don't know. I was a much nicer person back then, I suppose. But, obviously if I'm writing this 3 years later something was wrong.

And no, I never returned to \"overpriced just because it's in Dilworth\" Thai Taste.
Thai House (University AND Pineville-Matthews road) is MUCH better and a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"I came here for both lunch and dinner and I do have to say their lunch is much better than dinner. I'd have to say their lunch was much better. For their lunch menu, you get a selection of about 6 to 7 dishes that are either noodle, curry or fried rice. It comes with a spring roll and a salad. The flavors are pretty good, it's not the most authentic Thai restaurant, but for the price you are paying to get a lunch combo, it's great. Also, this place is pretty good for group setting. I do have to say it is is not the most spacious restaurant so be sure to come early or don't come right at prime time lunch hour. As for their dinner, it is more on the expensive side and I do not find anything on their menu that jumps YOU GOTTA TRY THIS! Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I am shocked at so little reviews.  This restaurant deserves some more love!  Although this place really does benefit from the locals, as a tourist like myself probably wouldn't have found it if it weren't for my friend's uncle recommending it to us (\"best Thai food in town\" he said).

Since I was still hung over from the night before (hell yea Vegas), my friends and I decided that an Asian noodle place would be in our best interests.  When we entered, we were greeted by one of the nicest server ever.  She was very friendly and attentiveness, and even told us she may have been us earlier (and if she means my friends and I drunk off our asses on the strip from the night before, then yes, she has seen us).  She was happy that we decided to dine in, since apparently the place gets a lot of take out orders.

I ordered the Chicken Pad-See Ew with Bok Choy (since they were limited on the amount of Chinese Broccoli), and it was quite a decision.  It was great!  The noodles were savory and not dry, and there was a generous helping of chicken.  Plus, the meal was barely $7, so it was both good and affordable.

I was also very happy that our server allowed my friend and I to drink our much needed Gatorade during our meal.  It was really the difference between us feeling hella crappy to feeling GOOD after our delicious Thai meal.

A definite hole in the wall that more people should check out."}
{"text":"a lot of people seem to like this place, and i don't know really know why. i mean, the food just tastes okay. i think it's kind of pricey, too, for what you get. here is why i think so:

1) i've been to thailand, and the food here tastes like watered-down thai food. like more westernized than it should be. 
2) i got a green curry, and all the vegetables that were in it were obviously frozen and the dish seemed like it was reheated--rather than being made-to-order. it was super-slow in the restaurant too, and i did not hear nor see any real cooking going on from my viewpoint of the kitchen. plus, we got our food unnaturally fast.
3) they serve canned sodas, instead of fountain. even though i don't drink soda that much, there are days when you just want something bubbly and caffeinated. plus, you don't want to have to pay over $1.50 or so for each glass you consume.
4) i am greatly influenced by the clientele. being a restaurant that serves asian cuisine, i like to not be the only asian person eating there. sorry folks. i'm not racist. it just makes sense that if other asians like it, then it's gonna be good."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time and it is GREAT. I am addicted to the Pad See Ew (Beef) It tastes super good @ the right spice (8). I always find myself getting the same thing. My co-workers love it too. We eat here weekly for lunch! The staff is very polite! The wait time is very decent for the quality of food. If you are going to try a new place with a new taste, you might want to start here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in CLT! My fiancé and I eat there at least once a week! Good food portions at lunch and dinner, friendly staff (we are on the extra egg roll status ) and its local! Have seen Luke K. From there Panthers there on occasion! My favorite is the green curry, super consistent as well!"}
{"text":"I actually really liked this place the food was not bad at all it was not the best either but it was worth it. I got enough food for two people for 11$ and change. So it was a great deal. But the reason I go back is because of the friendly staff. They didn't just leave me to sit in a corner while I waited for my food to go. They actually sat me gave me a glass of water and had a conversation with me. Granted this might have been different if the place was packed. 

But it is a good place for not a lot of money. And decent portions too. And the service was awesome. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. It is always packed at lunch. The service is quick and the meals are consistent. Be aware that the interior can feel cramped if they have a full crowd."}
{"text":"I didn't pack lunch for my first day of rotation. Perhaps it was the nerves or the fact that I didn't sleep well the night prior. Either way, there I was, at my rotation site without any rations on me. Luckily, at 10:00 AM, my preceptor receives a phone call stating that a drug rep was bringing us lunch. He ordered Thai food and ordered the entire office chicken pad thai.

At approximately 12:30 PM, the drug rep came with take-out boxes of chicken pad thai with extra rolls. The portions were definitely large, served with one spring roll and about two servings of noodles. The smell was enough to get my mouth watering, and I couldn't wait any longer. I heaped a generous portion of chicken pad thai into my mouth...and well...let's say that I have had better. There were sour notes in the noodles themselves, and the chicken was poorly seasoned. The noodles were clumped together suggesting that it wasn't fresh. Yes, yes, I know...this was take-out, but part of eating is savoring the presentation as well. The spring roll itself  was too heavy on the wrapper and devoid of filling; it was as if I was just eating the wrapper itself. What the heck was the filling?"}
{"text":"It's fast, it's close, it's okay. I've always eaten in the restaurant and the service has been good. For Thai food, it seems a bit generic but hey, it hits the spot when you have a craving and don't feel like cooking or driving far."}
{"text":"I've had takeout for Thai Taste that was incredible- unfortunately, I didn't order it myself so I never knew what I was eating. I went this past weekend and ordered the Gaeng Keow Wan Curry which I found to be super bland. It tasted more like water than anything else. I was really disappointed, and found myself wishing I ordered something else.

The restaurant itself is really cute, and I liked the Koong Gra Bok appetizer (kind of like a shrimp egg-roll), and my husband loved his meal (pad thai with pork) but I wasn't impressed with my meal at all. I will have to try their red curry to see if it's any better. Still a Siam girl for my Thai cravings..."}
{"text":"I did not get a chance to try too many dishes here during my short stay in Charlotte but I got the panang curry for dinner one night and it was DELICIOUS! Would love to try the other items on their menu"}
{"text":"I've never experienced better Thai.  I'm absolutely addicted.

I live in the Dilworth area and this has become my go-to.  Sometimes we eat in, but more often than not we grab take out and enjoy the yumminess at home.  For years, like many, I would order the Pad Thai.  Once I started branching out, I got hooked. 

I've since had the Poh Tok Soup, Gaeng Dang (one of my favorites), Gaeng Panang (my least favorite but still good), Mussumun Curry (awesome), Gaeng Kua Curry, and Pud Met Ma Muang (awesome stir fry).

It's all wonderful.  The staff is also awesome with excellent service and smiling faces!  I love Thai Taste and if you love great Thai food, here's your spot."}
{"text":"Put simply, Thai Taste is not much to look at - not on the outside, not on the inside. In fact, you may have driven by a number of times. I have no problem with that if for no other reason than it makes it easier for everyone else (myself included, naturally) to park, and they do not have a large lot, so every little bit helps.

That small lot probably makes sense, because it's not a large restaurant - and that only adds to the attraction. They know what they offer and are fine with it. Sometimes you get places that decide they want to offer a cavernous dining area, and that is fine - but here, the dining experience is exactly what fits.

As to the staff, they are not overly friendly, but they are definitely courteous, and they will help you decide on your meal, and you will get your meal promptly. It's not exactly fast, like you will find at some other places (generally Asian), who likely have things simmering in a variety of vats in the kitchen, but it is certainly not slow.

Spices can be adjusted as you like, though if you really like it hot, you'll need to make sure to tell them - even going to a 4 or 5 may not be enough if you like it really hot (I personally am fine with a 3.5 or so).

After all these years, this Thai Taste remains one of my favorite places to grab a satisfying bite. You're free to keep passing by, so as to keep that lot open when I need it."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is delicious (which is the most important thing anyway), but service is just meh. Also the interior is a little cramped up with not much elbow room between tables. It must be about as wide as a train compartment. While we were there, they always had a lot of take out packs waiting at the counter so other people might be sharing my opinions about the service / crowded interiors too? But I repeat, the food is MIND BLOWING.
We had the spring roll appetizer which was just okay. For entrees we had the Pud Met Ma Muang (cashew nut) with duck. The duck was delicious. It was crispy and full of flavor. We will definitely be back to try more variety (or maybe just keep ordering the duck?) but I definitely do recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had frequented Thai Taste since 2002 when I first heard about it and always enjoyed my food - the decor is a little cheezy, but the service and food was always good. Not the best thai I've had in my life, but good for Charlotte. 

I stopped going there in the fall of 2008 for some MAJOR reasons
1. The health code rating was a B at the time.
2. I was walking past the back door of the restaurant to my car and the door swung open and I got a glimpse into the kitchen - it was disgusting! Slimy floors, food all over the place and sweating cooks hovered over the stoves. 
3. My friend found a maggot in his food. Yes that's right a MAGGOT. 

Need I say more? 

While Thai Taste's biggest competitor (Monsoon) is less tasty than them, I would rather eat their food because their health ratings have always been a consistent A+."}
{"text":"I just moved out west from Charlotte, but Thai Taste was a staple with me and my fiancée. We had Thai Taste at least every 2 weeks. My fav dish is the Sweet & Sour w/ fried tofu, but I always asked for double tofu because...well, who can get enough tofu?
Apps are great there too-favorites are the spring rolls and fresh rolls are really good and the pot stickers are awesome."}
{"text":"Picture it. Thursday. Noon. All of Charlotte has descended on this small restaurant on East Blvd. Seriously, I think everyone in a 50 mile radius decided to have lunch here yesterday. Despite the mad rush, we waited only a few minutes to get a table.

I love any place that will immediately bring me a bowl of soup after I am seated. It's like a hug. So comforting and soothing.

The lunch specials are a little limited, but all the basics are there. I went with my usual: Shrimp Pad Thai. It comes with a spring roll and yummy dipping sauce. For me, the portion size is big enough to split into two meals. I always have leftovers to take home... no matter how hungry I am.

I got a water and a Coke, but was super jealous when they brought my friend's iced tea. It came with a pitcher of iced tea as well. I guess it's best soda doesn't come in a pitcher... although, that's probably every dentist's dream. Paging Dr. Cavity.

Dine in or take out... Thai Taste is a great place to grab food. Service is always on point... even when it's crazy busy. The people here are super nice. Never had a bad experience here. And to be honest, I don't know anyone who has. Keep up the good work Thai Taste."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here, and what I loved most was the diverse group of people dining here and the kitchy decorations on the wall (Melissa M sums it up with shabby chic Thailand!)  My bf had the coconut soup - wow!!  I had some delicious red curry and he had the delicious green."}
{"text":"So grateful to have found a delicious and affordable Thai restaurant in Charlotte. We really loved the Crispy Duck with Panang Curry!!! Just be aware that even the \"medium hot\" was almost too much heat. Next time we will get \"mild\"."}
{"text":"My boyfriend recently introduced me to Thai food.  The Pad Thai and Pad See Ew are amazing!! I love this place.  I don't believe the are open on Sunday's which is a bummer but great Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Went at about 815 on a Friday. Had to wait in line about 15 minutes. 
They were slammed, but still reasonable service times. 
We ordered a hot pot. The \"hot pot\" (flame) is mostly for show, the soup never was really hot enough before it burned out so the mushrooms pretty much remained raw. Flavor was meh. Pretty good lemongrass flavor but no \"spice\" that Thai food should have. 
We got a vegetable stir fry w shrimp. Very good flavors in a light sauce, but again, not an iota of spice. I have traveled to Thailand a couple of times and the only thing I can figure is the owners have watered down the dishes to suit American Tastes. As much as this place was recommended and I wanted to love it, was disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here with friends for dinner, and left full and happy.

I had the panang curry with chicken, with 3 out of 5 on the spice scale. The spice was balanced perfectly, and I gobbled it all up, including all of the rice.  This was delicious!  My partner had pad Thai, which was tasty but too sweet for my liking.

We had lettuce wraps and spring rolls for appetizers. Both were pretty good, but not outstanding.  The lettuce wrap filling could have included some shredded pork or egg, but appeared to just be crispy fried noodles.  Maybe I didn't read the menu carefully enough before ordering, but the flavor was still pretty good.  

The Thai iced coffees were very good, though I've had better for sure.

The atmosphere is kitschy, but I prefer this kind of older, established place over most new and fancy places like you'll find all over uptown and south end.  There's no pretense here, which is refreshing for the charlotte restaurant scene.  Prices seemed fair for what you get.

Based just on the panang curry I'll be back for sure ;)"}
{"text":"As a 2 stars review, it tastes like thai but nowhere near the good thai food i had, and far away from the best.

The shrimps are not prepared, the intestine still attached.  The taste is very bland.

The curry w beef is...  just ok.  The meat is very minimal in a meal, about 6 thin sliced beef.  Chewy but not very fresh taste.

My wife couldn't finish her pad thai, too sour and the whole thing just doesn't feel right.

May consider this restaurant again if I m very hungry and in the area, but otherwise I will be put looking for a better thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Dependable, no-fuss Thai spot. Service is quick but friendly, food is quality with good flavors, and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The food is decent. But they take forever. Not the best Chinese/Thai food but you get what you pay for. It's ok if you just want mediocre food. It's ok. :/"}
{"text":"Spring Rolls - Needed more shrimp and less noodles. The dipping sauce was good though. $3.95 for 2, wouldn't say its worth it.

Chicken Pad Thai - Kinda small for $12, but the noodles are well cooked. Wish there was less sauce. I would come back for this for lunch.

Pad See Ew - The noodles aren't as delicate as I am used to. The flavor was good though. Maybe it'd be more worthwhile for lunch. 

Excellent service, they even ran out to the parking lot to give me the take out boxes that I forgot at the table!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear on something. I love Thai Food. I mean REALLY love Thai Food. I will scour a city in search of the best thai food and eat at every restaurant if I have to (not joking). 

Thai Taste on East Blvd is what I imagine heaven to taste like. A bold statement I know. 

I have eaten at many a thai place in Charlotte and will only give my two enthusiastic thumbs up review to Thai Taste. At one point I was hitting up Thai Taste so regularly I thought I was going to recreate a Thai Food version of Cheers. I had to back down after that. 

As for the food I can recommend pretty much everything on the menu minus the stuff boasting some SERIOUS spice. My taste buds don't handle spicey well. 

The Pad Thai is insanely amazing as is the Pad See Ew (those are my ultimate favorite). If you go during lunch be sure to get there a little early as the place gets PACKED. Packed I tell you. Once you're sitting down it's a pretty quick turn around and the food always comes out piping hot. 

Light eaters beware, the portions are pretty generous. Not that I'm complaining."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai food in Charlotte.  Slammed for lunch, but they'll get you fed quickly.  Curries very good.  Best known for Pud Thai.  Dare you to get 4**** or more.  Friendly, efficient staff.  Seems like everyone in Charlotte goes to East Blvd Thai Taste."}
{"text":"Normally if a place isn't good I wouldn't do a review but I will for Thai Taste because Im surprised at how bad it was! Ive always heard good things about this place. 

I ordered Chicken Pad See Ew and they gave me complimentary fried shrimp/egg roll things. I was hungry so I was ready to dive into my food but, it just wasn't good!

The chicken looked poor in quality and it had an odd smell. I couldn't help but to think of dirty mop water the whole time I attempted to eat it. On top of not being able to finish it my stomach turned and I had heartburn for the rest of the night. I will not order take out again; first & last time for me!"}
{"text":"I love the Panang Chicken, and the service is always friendly. It's very clean, and pretty, although seating is limited.
 The Thai Tea is very good, although $# for a smallish serving is kinda steep.
 We have been eating there for years, the taste is always the same, unlike some of the Thai places where its different every time."}
{"text":"Worse place I've ever been!!!! Super small portion on curry!!!! Oh and the hotpot soup was a freaking joke! Yeah it looks cool but the portion was ridicules small. Tasteless....the curry we got had frozen peas and carrots! C'mon you have to use fresh ingredients. The most annoying part is they charge you $2 for extra rice!!!!!! I mean no Asian place will charge you rice..........we live a block away and will never come here again nor will we recommend this to anybody.  People, Thai Thai takeout is the way. $11.95 awesome curry with more than enough for 2 meals portion!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid thai dishes. I've only come here for lunch. Their pad thai is pretty good. Stir fry dish can be hit or miss. Pretty good value for lunch with springroll, soup, iced tea and entree combo. Busy during lunch but never so busy where i had to wait in line to be seated. Can take them a while to get the dishes out of the kitchen. Overall I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and yum again! This is one of the tastiest Thai restaurants I ave ever been to. I always get some version of their many curry dishes, and they are all delicious! This is a regular neighborhood dining spot for me."}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad. I had the chicken pad thai and the thai chicken wings which were really full of good flavor. The only hangup I had about it was that I wish there was an option to select how spicy I wanted my pad thai. I will eat there again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Dine-in. Carry out. Lunch. Dinner. You can't go wrong! I was introduced to Thai Taste in 2010 and it's been a staple for me ever since then.  Once a week. Sometimes twice a week. When I worked in the area, I was definitely a regular. So much so that they know who I am when I call in my order and when I dine-in they walk up to my table with a smile and can tell me what I will order. My staples are the chicken Pud Thai and the fried dumplings (can't recall the Thai name). I've tried the pad see ew and fried rice which were pretty good too. If you go during lunch they offer a cup of complimentary soup that is pretty tasty too. What are you waiting for? Walk in today for some great Thai food."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! What a combo. 

Try #20 - it's delicious! This is my favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and service was good. I had chicken pad Thai and was good and what I would expect. My only issue is I think they mixed up my spice level and my husbands. Mine was super spicy for level 2 and his was not at a 4. Will return and recommend."}
{"text":"I came once and ordered veggie pad Thai. The veggies were undercooked and the sauce was sickly sweet and goopy. Pad Thai is supposed to be a bright light dish and this was really a strange and not tasty dish."}
{"text":"Read reviews before I ordered, not that it would have deterred me. Ordered Pad Thai and Fried Spring Rolls for pickup. 15 mins tops, picked it up and took it home and it was still piping hot. Spring rolls are perfectly crunchy with a great sweet and sour sauce. Pad Thai with 4-star spicy was delicious. I do typically like mine a little sweeter, but I think the spice level took away that factor. I also would have liked either more peanuts or for them to be on top, I think they got a little soggy in the to-go container."}
{"text":"Very upset with this place. I had the chicken pad thai and it made me sick. As I am culinary student, I had no hesitation to report this place to SNHD. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant as we had just moved to the South End area and love Thai food. 

However, we were quite dissapointed when we got home to realize that one of our items was not what it was supposed to be and that the Pad See Ew was a bit mushy and flavorless. 

We will try again and dine in - the woman at the register was very flustered with the volume of take away orders which could have contributed flaws in our experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The food is phenomenal. My experience with the service tonight however, was inexcusable. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table without being greeted. I understand they were busy, but in customer service and the restaurant business, you greet your guests. 
We then sat at the table without anyone coming over for aprox 15 minutes. This is ridiculous. Hire more service. It was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I am not giving one star because I have had good experiences at this restaurant before. However today there was a medium length straight hair in my food which has turned me off. I will probably hit order from Thai taste again. I'm very disappointed"}
{"text":"Important note! I've only ordered delivery from this place, never been to the physical location!

I've ordered from Thai Taste a couple times now, and every time the food has been exactly what I ordered, hot, portioned well, and in sturdy containers. This most recent time I got some Thai iced tea, wondering if it was even something they'd deliver, but but I was curious. And lo, it was there in the brown paper bag, in a large styrafoam cup that was wrapped in a plastic bag, packed in nicely between everything else. Excellent high risk Tetris work!! They've made me a regular."}
{"text":"Not that I have anything super-original to say about our dear Thai Taste, but I have to agree-- it's the best Thai in Charlotte, and I wish it was better. But when you need a bowl of steaming curry, you know where you can find it, at least, eh?

Somewhat authentic flavors, if a bit toned down, mixed with a pleasant waitstaff and lovely atmosphere make this a place I look forward to. Do remember: if you're going to have lunch here, brave the crowds and eat in, as the take-out lunch portions are much smaller than the eat-in's and don't come with soup."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have eaten there regularly for over 8 years now and love it!!  Good food, good service, good atmosphere.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Veggie Pad Thai.  - Yum!"}
{"text":"as far as thai taste being the best in charlotte,  sorry, but the best left quite some time ago.  that was thai chef over on international drive.  the owners where awesome and the food was delicious and sam always made my food as spicy as he could possibly dare to.  no one has come close to his cooking since they left charlotte.  i was really upset a couple of weeks ago when i got a tofu dish from thai taste.  the portions are small for the money and i got a couple of pieces of tofu.  im a big veggie eater so lots of vegetables don't bother me as much as tiny portions or tons of broccoli and mushrooms which a lot of these places seem to do.  spiciness was ok although the guy is always saying he'll knock my socks off as far as spiciness goes.  that would be siam garden.  whew!!  haven't been to thai thai in quite some time, since i like to get lunch and they ticked me off as well as dejai treating me as someone that must be kidding when i request thai spicy.  that irks me as much as small portions.  waiting for my take out at thai taste,  observed peoples meals coming out and they looked more appetizing and plentiful than the food i took home."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times for take out. Fast, friendly service! Reasonably priced and good flavors. I really enjoyed the Gaeng Dang with chicken. The first time I went with a 4 spice level and it wasn't as hot as I expected so the next visit I upped it to a 5 spice level. As I told the guy on the phone when I ordered, \"what the hell, it's Tuesday, right?\". None the less, I took it home anticipating my mouth catching fire, well it didn't. I was disappointed until I had the leftovers the next evening. That's when I located the 5 spice level at the bottom of the dish. Wow, it really brought the heat! Lesson learned, eat the whole damn thing in one sitting! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Came to know of this gem very recently ! one of the best thai places in charlotte !! simply love their pud thai !! its saucy..and so full of flavor ! also tried out their masaman and special friend rice ! yum yumm yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a Thai restaurant, feels like a Thai restaurant, but is just barely a Thai restaurant. Sure it has mirrored embroidered elephant prints and little bamboo shoots, but so does Pier 1. The food is why we go  out to eat and the experience weighs pretty heavy too. This place hits about half way on both fronts:

Food is mediocre. If you've ever been at a real Thai restaurant, you'd know it. The Tom Ka Soup was lacking all the usual fair: galanga, lemon grass, ginger....where were you? I missed you in there. Instead, I got a watery coconut broth with tofu and raw mushrooms. No baby corn, but broccoli instead; which in my opinion is very weird in soup, especially if it's cut for a salad. The Pad Thai was pretty good. No mystery meat, real cuts of beef (god bless the south), but it was a bit on the sweet side (god bless the south). 

Service was diner quality, pretty much non-existant.
I don't know if I'd recommend it, but it's probably worth take out."}
{"text":"The only meat we are eating this month is seafood so I felt somewhat limited recently when thinking of a place to grab a quick to-go lunch. I've seen this restaurant a million times while visiting paper skyscraper so I decided to give it a try. It was crazy packed so I was thankful I was ordering to-go. I ordered vegetable pud thai, which based on the description I figured was a twin sibling to pad thai. 

(sigh)
This was nowhere near as delicious as the pad thai that I order at other places. While the spring roll was pretty good, I didn't even eat half of the pud thai. It was dry and lacked flavor. I ordered a level four spice but it wasn't spicy throughout- there were just a ton of crushed peppers on top. Also, there was no slice of lime, which normally adds to the flavor. 

Was it gag-me-gross? No. What it particularly good? No."}
{"text":"if you're looking for some good thai.. here's your place.  Portions are very generous and the service is fast and friendly.  They are a tad pricey, but you'll get your money worth.  Cashew Chicken is a great!"}
{"text":"definitely NOT authentic thai food.
the pad thai tasted very americanized. did not have the peanuty tamarind taste that pad thai usually has. it tasted like sweet and sour.

was super disappointed, sad, upset that i wasted calories on this meal.

they also did not have sriracha (which was definitely needed) and their hot sauces were weird and watery yuckk"}
{"text":"Thai food...I have eaten a lot of it in many different places...including Thailand.  Therefore, as I have said before in my past reviews it is hard for me to be blown away.  As I found with this first visit, Thai Taste will meet your Thai food meal requirements if you live near or are in the area.  

Atmosphere - Quasi-Thai décor, elephants, table seating, surprising for a Charlotte Thai restaurant...no mint green paint! 

Food - I ordered the Beef Salad Grilled to start.  It consisted of sliced beef mixed w/ cucumbers, red onions, chili, and tomatoes all marinated in a Thai spicy dressing.  It was respectable, as the steak was of decent quality.  The dressing used in the salad however lacks the little zing that I am accustomed too.  For my main dish, I had the Gaeng Keow Wan Curry, which was a green curry in coconut gravy with lemon grass, bamboo shoots, peas, carrots, bell peppers, chili, and basil leaves.  I inquired and was surprised to find out that they will adjust the dish ingredients.  This is great if the server understands what you did or did not want.  I asked that they omit the peas and for some reason she had them hold the carrots and add green beans.  Oh well...I never could figure why the US Thai restaurants always want to put green beans and/ or peas in their curry dishes.  Anyway, the dish was still satisfying but not spicy enough for my liking.    

Service - polite, accommodating, confused, quick 

Price - The pricing was on average to high for the quantity of food received.  

Overall - While I will not go out of my way to eat here again, but if I am in the area or with a group of friends, like this night, and craving Thai...Thai Taste will fit the bill."}
{"text":"I had heard that this was one of the best Thai restaurants in Charlotte, so I finally made it to try it out. I've only been to a handful of Thai restaurants, but this one definitely stands out as the best I've been to so far. 

We went for lunch and were seated immediately. All lunch entrees come with a pitcher of iced tea, rice, and a spring roll. I got the Pud Khing Sod which was their ginger based dish. It was absolutely delicious. The ginger flavor really came through without being overpowering. The vegetables were all very fresh and well cooked. The only complaint I heard at the table was that it wasn't very spicy (I don't like spicy food, so this wasn't a problem for me). Everyone cleared their plates, so it must have been good!

I'll definitely be coming back here in the future for lunch and recommending it to others as well!"}
{"text":"Thai can be a hit or miss with me especially since some Thai dishes can be greasy. Thai taste make really great food not too greasy. The fried rice is good and so is thepad thai. I liked thier version of chicken noodle soup and the coconut pudding is to die for!!  Very friednly service!"}
{"text":"If we were judging on the food alone I would have bumped up the rating, but the restaurant is very tiny.  We went at lunch and had trouble parking, when we walked in the restaurant at 1 in the afternoon it was packed-obviously it's popular.  However no one was there to greet us or tell us how long the wait would be.  There were already some people standing by the entrance when we got there waiting to be seated.  After being passed by and ignored a table opened up and the man just waved us over to it.  Maybe it was because they were just super busy but it felt super rushed.  They didn't even ask what we wanted to drink when someone came to our table they just asked if we were ready to order.
The lunch menu was really small and I was kinda disappointed cause it didn't have my usual favorite thai curry so I settled for something else (which was still really good). Don't know if we will be back, we have other thai places that are less cramped and way friendlier with food just as yummy."}
{"text":"Always the most consistent thai food in the area. The service is fast and they are always busy, which I take to mean I share my favorable opinion with many other people. I've worked my way up the spicy levels over the years. Finally enjoying 5 out of 5. If you need me, I make a stop here most Wednesdays.  They have my most solid of curry recommendations. Particularly the massaman and panang. Go go go."}
{"text":"this is my go to once a week thai binge spot. i basically get the exact same order ever (DAMN) time and im never disappointed. For reference, thats the 42, spicy level 3 (so i can add my own sriracha) and some assortment of chicken, beef and or shrimp, although ive largely stopped ordering the beef here because its just a little on the chewy side. The thai salad is also awesome. I would however stay away from their duck, as its just not that awesome, kudos for putting it on, but unfortunately it just doesnt deliver (for me at least). The order guy is super cool, hes a white dude who speaks thai, and all the servers there are just salt of the earth nice people, so its really quite nice to eat here be it dine in or take out!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I got the pad thai and it was really good. There is another thai place in charlotte that I love a bit more than this place, so only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fine food, but expect a long wait if you Order takeout. Also expect rude service at the counter; the staff is not friendly, and bossy. I'd order somewhere easier in the future tbh."}
{"text":"Went here on a date. Extremely loud environment for some reason. Probably the way the tables are set up and the echos (???? Who knows!). The place is beautiful and gives a very nice feel of Thailand. Food is pretty good. I got the Pad See Ew. Flavor was good, though had a hint of sweetness. It's been while since I had this dish. Not sure if its suppose to be sweet. My date had a dish with Duck. It was delicious. Flavorful and the skin was crunchy. Went on Saturday night and there was plenty of parking available. Not a place to go to have a nice one-on-one conversation but good for group gatherings."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for your reviews of Thai Taste.  The food was very good and the service adequate, but very slow.  We started with the Pla Muk Tod (calamari), which was okay, but felt more frozen than fresh.  My husband had the shrimp Pad Thai and I had the beef Pud Prig Khing.  Mine was excellent and so was my husband's, but both needed more spice; enter the garlic sauce.  Ahh, that's better! Now I get that we are in Dilworth and not everyone can handle Thai spice, but these dishes were way too Americanized.  Adding the garlic sauce definitely added a world of difference.  The quantity of meat in both dishes was small too compared to the vegetables.   Overall, the food was good and I would go back but it was not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Grew up in Thailand and love going to Thai Taste for a consistently great meal to satisfy my Thai food craving ! Love their curries and their peanut sauce is perfect."}
{"text":"A nice Thai restaurant on the South End. We stuck to the basics: Thai fried rice and pad Thai. They let you choose your level of spiciness (1-5, 1 being not spicy at all). I ordered the 4 and I thought it was great. I'm not sure I'd order the 5 though. Also had some hot sake with my meal- very good. Also has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The McDonald's of Thai Food.  

It's edible but that's about it.  This is very mediocre Thai food.  It tastes hastily prepared with minimal effort to use quality ingredients or to create the depth and layers of flavor that exist in good Thai food.  

Don't waste your time.  There are plenty of other Thai places in town."}
{"text":"Once again, I tried Thai Taste.  We had a beautiful window view seat.  I ordered fried tofu as an appetizer.  It came with a sweet and sour sauce and was quite good.  For my entree, I ordered pad thai, which I prepare at home and love.  As with my visit before, I requested a heat level of 4.  The dish arrived, with tofu, vegetables, and a heavily sweetened sauce, but no heat.  Like before, I dumped the supposedly hot sauce from the table on it with no noticeable results.  Next time, should I request a heat level of 10?  It only goes up to 5.  My husband requested a heat level of 3, and he stated that his dish was spicier than mine.  Is it that my tolerance for spiciness exceeds most people's expectations?  Or, does the restaurant think that as a woman, my longing for heat is wantonly and should be more subdued?  The food is not bad (although I would appreciate the sauce being less sweet and hotter); therefore, I can't lower the rating, but I certainly won't give a higher one."}
{"text":"I like Thai Taste but I don't know that they are the \"best\" Thai restaurant I have ever been to.  I have visited the Matthews location as well and I was not very impressed.  The pad thai tasted fishy and the spice they used completely overpowered the other flavors.  So it was basically fishy cayanne.  Great!

Ok, I know this isn't about the Mattthews location but I had to preface this review by letting you know the experience I had at their sister location.  So, I tried the pud see ew.  I think the \"ew\" pretty much describes the dish.  Others recommended it so I went for it.  Big Mistake.  It was basically salted noodles with a couple pieces of broccoli.  I added shrimp and they were super fishy.  It just wasn't good.  

My friend tried the green curry and that was pretty good...heavy on the coconut but it was decent.  My other friend tried something that had tofu in it so I didn't even try hers.  :)

The wine was served in these little dessert wine glasses that I couldn't even get my lips around--odd and not enjoyable.

The service was good, the atmosphere was simple, the prices were decent but I just am not that thrilled with the quality of the food.  I know for some reason it is just me but I just find it to be ok."}
{"text":"Yum!

I always order Pad Thai the first time I go to a thai restaurant, and whether or not I like it decides if I will make an effort to return, and Thai Taste's was definitely delicious.

I love their daily menus, keeping it simple. I guess you can request something that's not on that day's sheet but still, I'll take the one page over an exhaustive book.

Although very friendly, don't expect much beyond the basics from your server (at least during lunch), you'll get a pitcher of water/tea/etc to refill your own glass and the check is dropped off moments after you get your plate. Thankfully that's all I'm looking for with my lunch service- I'm hungry and I'm watching the clock!"}
{"text":"This place has been our favorite Thai restaurant since moving to this area over 5 years ago. I recently switched to a Plant Based diet and hadn't been going out. I looked on their menu and there was no vegan options for me. This was so upsetting for me until one day my roommate called and sure enough they had Tofu Pad Thai. It was not on their menu as the company they hired doesn't allow changes. Vegans rejoice they have Tofu and they will remove eggs from their dishes! We are so happy to be able to come here again. They always know us and are so kind and helpful! I can't explain enough how much we love coming here or picking up for a to-go order!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and am obsessed with Thai Taste for lunch. They offer lunch specials everyday, which are served with soup and a spring roll.
There are 7 options daily, from traditional Pad Thai and Pud See Ew to others like Pud Asparagus and Rice with Veggies.  With each dish you add your protein, shrimp, chicken, pork and beef. So far my favorite is the Pud Asparagus. If you like asparagus, and knowing they are fresh this time of year, this is your dish!
Once your order is placed your complimentary soup is served, a clear broth with napa cabbage, peas and carrots, so perfect to start a meal.

Overall the dishes are great and the service is on point, they have a system that works great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite thai place in Charlotte. I always order the Pud see ew. Extra noodle. Spice level 4. The curry is Excellent as well. Kind friendly service and very fast. Go for lunch! !"}
{"text":"Loved it!! 
Impromptu stop while driving through Charlotte and what a fantastic choice. Menu was simple and easy to understand, although I relied on the expertise of my date in ordering. Plates arrived quickly. At first I thought the serving size was a bit small, but it ended up the perfect amount. 
The Pad Thai was surprisingly sweet, but still excellent. 
Atmosphere was cozy and very authentic.  A definite new favorite when traveling through charlotte."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and enjoyed it as a one of our favorite restaurants. Why is the health score 81, and when will they be reassessed? 81 is really really bad."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for months..finally made in. It took me nearly 30 minutes to order because everything looked so good. With help from an employee ( he was awesome ) I ordered a curry with a side of steamed dumplings. 
I am definitely pleased with my choice. 
That that being said, I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lunch here frequently and have been for several years. Food is always the same and fresh!! I must say its the best Thai food you can get in the Charlotte area, I say that because I have tried a few others and they just don't measure up!! If you're in Charlotte and in the mood for some Thai, please check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai and pang curry I've ever had. This place is a classic- hole in the wall with AWESOME flavors. The decor is meh and there is fake wood on the walls but the flavors and good service you barely notice. 

I just wish they delivered or were on Grubhub- I'm so lazy in the winter!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Thai Taste for at least nine years. Maybe it's the best Thai in Charlotte, maybe it isn't. But one thing it absolutely is is consistent. They have a half dozen lunch specials that are inexpensive, served fast and served tasty. Red or green curry, pad thai and some other things that I never order because the pad thai is just excellent.

When you order, the heat is measured from \"0 stars\" (no heat at all) to \"5 stars\" (should be served with a fire extinguisher). Remember to ask for \"fresh peppers\" instead of the dried peppers which doesn't change the level of heat but does change the flavor a bit. Depending on mood, I'm having either two stars or three stars and that's plenty hot for me.

One of these days, I'll land here outside of lunch hours. It hasn't happened yet.

Same great folks, consistently great Thai food. Thai Taste is very good.

(Do stop by their neighbor, Paper Skyscraper!)"}
{"text":"I took my Mother here for her birthday on April 11th. Worst Thai restaurant I have ever been to! We ordered veggie spring rolls and they only had cabbage in them....just cabbage....nothing else.  The food was not fresh and the employees were not friendly. The decor was very dated and the tables looked like they were from the dollar tree. We will never be back. If I could give this place 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the overall amount and quality of food. While everything tasted fine, nothing captured my attention enough to come back."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town. I also like the ambiance when they are about to close. The restaurant is quiet and the waiters/waitress were attentive to all of my needs: boxes, small container for sauces, thai ice tea to go, extra rice! I really like their food and would highly recommended you patronize. Take note that their yellow curry is mild, not spicy but at least for my liking. Plenty of parking and Paper scraper for you to walk off your food next door and drop some cash in exchange for some new fun strange digs!!!!"}
{"text":"This is another one of those, \"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!\"  As one of my all time favs, I thought for certain I had given this place 5 stars long ago!

Located on East Blvd in Dilworth, this place is tucked in a corner pocket and can be easy to miss.  It shares a tiny parking lot with Paper Skyscraper.  Once inside, it's a small space with traditional Thai decor.  They have made the most out of the small space with many tables relatively close to one another, and it can be a bit loud when at max capacity.  

They offer all of the Thai standards including Pad Thai, Red and Green Curry, and Pad Se Ew.  Most entrees come with your choice of chicken, beef, tofu, or shrimp.  Servers use the 0 to 5 star scale when asking for your spice level preference.  Lunch is served with the soup of the day as a first course as well.  

Wait at the door to be seated upon entry.  Not to worry if others are ahead of you, as the tables tend to turn quickly.  Head straight to the bar for carryout or call ahead orders.  If dining in, you'll need to take the check to the counter to pay after your server leaves it on your table. 

Hours of operation are a bit tricky.  They are closed on Sundays and Mondays.  Tuesday through Friday they close after lunch at 2pm and reopen for dinner at 5pm.  They remain open between lunch and dinner on Saturdays."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch today and were not impressed. The speed of the service and the starter soup were good, but that was it. The soup, I feel, was a take on chicken noodle soup but with tofu instead of chicken. We ordered the lunch kee mao and spicy chicken dish. I feel like they sacrificed quality for speed here. The Kee Mao was very bland with questionable chicken pieces, way too chewy for my liking. The chili chicken was also very bland.

What I really disliked about our experience here was the fact that they don't take spice levels seriously. When a restaurant asks how spicy you like it, they make it to order so the customer does not have to change the spice levels themselves. Thai Tastes chefs dumped a clump of red chili pepper flakes on top of both dishes to achieve a spice level of 3.5/5, that is a lot of chili flakes. This lazy move made our dishes inedible! We left quickly without taking the large amount of food that remained. 

We definitely won't be back. I prefer Thai Thai Takeout, the quality is a lot better and you get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"It's such a strange thing to me... all the food here in NC tastes so different than that of CA... 

Went in here last night to get some tom kha with tofu and tofu pad thai with a thai beer. 

The tom kha was ok... didn't resemble my fav from back home at all and it was somewhat of a let down because I haven't had thai food since I left CA. 

Would I try it again... hmmmm I really don't know. 

As for the pad thai... I really can't even explain the taste.. all I remember is vinegar and peanut... they didn't even have my fish sauce I love so much in my tom kha

Well I won't be rushing back anytime soon, but I will keep it in the back of my mind."}
{"text":"Came here frequently in college. Fell in love with the green curry. I had the chance to go to Thailand for myself and eat some of the dishes I learned to love at Thai Taste - and Thai Taste's versions of the dishes are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is the equivalent texmex is to Mexican food. Tried 6 different dishes, one was ok the rest were just terrible. Nothing like what they are supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"Still giving them 5 stars even though it took about an hour to get our food. Customer service with the person over the phone and delivery driver was exceptional. Food was absolutely delicious. This is my new thai/Chinese cusine place."}
{"text":"I'd say a solid 3.5 stars for Thai Taste on East Blvd.  Food is good, service can be hit or miss depending on how busy they are, but if I lived closer I would be here for take out a lot!  My last visit, we were actually seated near the desk where people come in and pay and the orders were lined up on the counter.... It would be a little overwhelming, but I think it's great that can handle that many orders at one time (this was also on a Sunday evening!!).

One minus is that they didn't have a kid's menu, but the server was good about recommending things that are good for children.

Had the C-2... curry at a spice level 4... and man it about kicked my a**.  Luckily they put all the pepper flakes in the middle so you can mix it in yourself (which I thought was smart) so you can gradually make it to your spice level... I went a little gun-ho and mixed it all in, but in hindsight should have taken it down a notch.   Oh well - another time.

Parking is a little tight, but there are plenty of spaces.  I would stay clear of the spaces toward the front of the lot because you have people zooming in and out trying to get their take out.  When you are hungry, you are hungry, because people seem to whip in here like no tomorrow..."}
{"text":"It's been ages since I've been to Thai Taste.  Why, I don't know.  I go by it all the time. But I vowed not to cook tonight and was hungry for something spicy.  

The place is tastefully decorated although the tables are a bit close together so if there were a chance I was going to have an intimate conversation with myself, someone would probably here it. 

As far as the food, I ordered a clear soup that was loaded with veggies.  It was so fresh and satisfying. 

The main course is something I usually try at other area Thai restaurants.  I forget the name it just has vegetables and basil and my choice of meat which was chicken.  No rice for me and they didn't have a problem with that.  The plate came out full and nicely displayed with shredded red cabbage on the side.  

I usually order 4-5 stars of spice level at Thai places, depending on what their highest level is.  For Thai Taste, it's a 5.  So that's what I ordered and it did not disappoint.  Most places come out a 3 and I'm adding more spice on the table.  This was spot on and enough to linger just when I went out the door.  

So now I re-found my neighborhood Thai place.  This place has it all.  Good food, good service and good prices."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant, small yet cozy, nicely decorated with very friendly staff.  The menu made me wonder about the food - only because it had that pick your protein, then your preparation style layout, which is a little strange and usually means the food will be terribly Americanized.

All in all the prices are reasonable and the food is pretty good. It's not the best, most authentic Thai food that you'll ever have, but it's a solid bet if you're in the mood.  If you're a Thai food snob (like me) it won't live up to your standards, but it's satisfactory and will likely please the average Thai food craving."}
{"text":"Great food and fast friendly service. Very reasonable prices. Flavors very yummy and food came quick and fresh. I'd recommended for a date night, family night or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and always enjoy it. Fast, well-priced, and tasty. 

Try the Shrimp Pad See Ew with level 2 spice!"}
{"text":"So being Sunday and feeling kinda lazy I wanted to order in. If you have been following me, I have been reviewing more Northwest area restaurant due to the fact that I live near Summerlin. This restaurant I spotted one day driving in the area and found out they deliver. So I got Appetizer - Gyoza , Pad Thai, and Green Tea Ice Cream. Gyoza was amazing -- very fresh had a spicy sauce with it witch was good but killed the dumpling meat taste. Pad thai -- it was average unfortunately no peanuts or crushed on it or little, and noodles where good. The Green tea ice cream to me tasted more like vanilla ice cream with a green color but it was good I have seen some where its intensely green tea flavored. I have no major complaints, The Gyoza where probably some the best I have had. Will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place ever. Been going for years and will continue to. Love all the stuff and customer service"}
{"text":"This place has been here since 1988.
It's a small dining room so if you go during prime time you'll wait.

They have a great lunch deal where you get the choice of chicken, pork or beef and add your various veggie or noodle options.

She will ask how spicy. Your choices are 1 to 5, I got 2 and my eyes were watering.

It includes tea, soup and a spring roll.

Food quality is OK."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Charlotte.  I repeat.  This is the BEST Thai food in Charlotte. Another one of the \"secret\" restaurants that you need to be told about it's located in the Dilworth area right next to the popular gift store Paper Skyscraper.  The original and best of several locations (Matthews, University) I went there religiously the entire time I lived in CLT.  

As diverse as their menu was, I only sampled three dishes there Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao and \"House Noodles\".  The last one being a specialty that's no longer listed on the menu.  The rating system is 1 to 6 stars and you can even order it with no stars for the scared or gastro-intestinally challenged.  For the true \"chili head\" you can augment the rating system.  Normally, they use crushed Thai peppers in the food which are still hot but don't capture the true essence of the \"heat\" and flavor.  When you're ready for the big leagues make sure to denote \"fresh peppers\" when giving them your stars.  The flavor difference is immediately noticeable from the very first bite.

For lunch during the week you need to get there by 11:30am or after 1:00pm unless you want to stand in line for a long time.  The place is popular and regularly packed.  They get all the businesses in the area, the residents of the trendy Dilworth neighborhood and a boatload of cops.  For many (like myself) this place is an addiction and you will see many regulars.

I can't say enough good things about this place.  When I spent most of '07 overseas this was one of the first places I hit upon returning to the States.  Even now, all other Thai places I encounter are measured against Thai Taste.  If you spend any time in the Charlotte area you simply MUST try this restaurant out, you will not be disappointed.

*side note* For the truly adventurous you can go past the 6 star rating, but be prepared for \"heat\" especially when going the \"fresh peppers\" route.  Also be aware that anything over 10 stars is a personal challenge to the chef and he will guarantee you feel more heat/pain than you ever have in your life.  Enjoy responsibly."}
{"text":"I wish we could rate halfs...

But food was good not as good as some places in charlotte but it's up there! 

I really enjoyed the curry so if that is your thing go for it. 

Fried tofu was ok... sause was really good! 

Spring rolls where fresh and yummy!  

Tried the beef fried rice and that was yummy! Not really greasy which made it good! 

Servers were good not issues with them either

I will be going back for more!"}
