{"text":"Always a great experience going here. My family and I eat here at least once a week. Their cheese dip is to die for."}
{"text":"Yes the outward appearance makes the place look a little shady, but there were a decent amount of cars in the parking lot on a week night so we gave it a try.  Chips were hot, salsa was average, but the food was excellent. There were 3 in our party and all of us gave the food high marks. The biggest negative for me and everyone else in our group, was the service. The waitresses were extremely slow in seating us (we were the only ones waiting), taking our order, checking to see if we needed anything like more chips or drink refills... The waitresses seemed to be uninterested as they spent a lot of time on their cell phones and talking amongst each other. Quite frankly the service was worse than the outside appearances of the building."}
{"text":"The building has a colorful assorted history of other restaurants but I have a feeling this one will stick.  Great location, big spaces for big groups, food was great.    The fajitas are tasty but I still feel like they are with me the next day... stick to the combo plates.  Best Mexican in town."}
{"text":"We come here regularly because it's decent Mexican food and much better than the other restaurant. The only problem is the waiting staff they aren't very attentive and we have been waiting for 20 minutes to get water and chips refilled and we still have had no luck."}
{"text":"We have visited this place a few times before reviewing.  After trying several dishes, our overall review is YUMMY! I highly recommend this place.    I enjoy the Steak Chimichanga with the addictive cheese sauce.  The steak has great flavor and  two of them is filling.    The chips served are hot and delicious and they make sure you don't run out.    The margaritas are tasty and come in 4 different sizes - regular, jumbo, monster, and pitcher.    We have gotten meals to go and all have been correct.  No missing items."}
{"text":"I ordered Karmen's Carnitas! Carnita heaven! I also ordered a side of onions, cilantro & limes! Warm & friendly! Close to Clift Falls park"}
{"text":"Paul and I almost drove away from Diego's based on the restaurant's exterior appearance, but I'm glad the gods of chance convinced us to give it a try. We literally flipped a coin, and heads meant we had to stay.  We found the interior to be in stark contrast to the exterior. In fact, it looks as though it was recently renovated. Everything looked new, the booth was comfortable, and the bathrooms were clean (muy importante).   Our server brought out tortilla chips, which were pleasantly warm, and salsa, right away. The salsa was far too mild and I could taste chile powder in it, which I thought was odd. Use fresh chiles, please. It also needed some lime juice. Paul asked for hot sauce, and our server brought out a house made sauce. We added some of it to the salsa and it definitely improved it.  Paul ordered a Modelo and a lunch combo platter that included a burrito, a taco, rice, and beans. You can't beat a $3.00 beer, and Paul enjoyed his food selections.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas, which came with rice and beans. The cheese was perfectly melted, and the enchilada sauce, which was an interesting shade of orange, was good. The rice and beans were also good.  My iced tea tasted more like water than tea.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4 thanks to friendliness and cleanliness. I would go back."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to get some really good Mexican food, but this place was a real disappointment.  The Taco's are the worst I've ever had it was so bland and discussting. The taco salad was the same and for the price I could have went to Don Pablo's or Chuy's."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexiacn food I have had in my travels. Huge  portions, very well seasoned. Not so spicy it can't be eaten but the perfect mix of flavor and spice. Need one of these in Louisville!"}
{"text":"Sadly, another solidly mediocre dining experience in Madison.  Let's start with the strengths of Diego's: -Friendly staff -Family friendly (without sacrificing menu or experience) -Clean  Weaknesses: -our food took an inordinate amount of time (more than 30 minutes for three meals) -the food is ok. Just ok. Much of what we had was bland, which for Mexican food was particularly disappointing -two of our orders were incorrect.  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, so when you find a great spot for i in small town America you consider yourself lucky! Last night I had some really great service, really great chips and salsa, really great veggie fajitas, and an ice cold Corona! All the food was top notch and the service was great as well! The layout of the place is a bit weird... AKA my relative went behind the register at one point looking for where to pay the bill, but everyone was kind and the food was great! Well done Diegos!"}
