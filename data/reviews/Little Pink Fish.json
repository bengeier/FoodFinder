{"text":"We had the spicy fish, the bamboo wok and the chili chicken. They were all delicious but not very spicy. The price of the dishes range from 10-13$ each so it's relatively cheap compared to other restaurants. We were all pretty full at the end. 

The place is not big but it's quite clean. The service is ok, I mean, you can't expect excellent service from a chinese restaurant unless it's not authentic."}
{"text":"This used to be called KanBai, but changed name for unknown reasons (maybe they just wanted an English name for practical reasons). I'm not sure what Little Pink Fish refers to, but Little Red Fish would have been more accurate, given the new Chinese name (???). They also redecorated the dining room with old Chinese propaganda posters, portraits of Mao by Warhol and whatnot. The menu remained pretty much the same. 

I went there with an old friend on a Friday night, and we ordered our old favorites. They tasted just as good as before, so I'm guessing no big changes happened in the kitchen either. My all-time fav is the Eggplant and Tofu clay pot, a tasty mix of tender eggplant and fried, ultra-silky tofu. I could eat that for days!! My friend picked her all-time favorite, the Fish filets in hot chili oil, a classic Sichuanese dish. I would say that Little Pink Fish pretty much remained the same, so all the past reviews from KanBai are still relevant. The Little Pink Fish is actually the restaurant I recommend to friends looking for Chinese food. Their fare is more than decent in Montreal's standards, prices are good, service is rather fast and portions are generous. 

Note: They filled the bathroom walls with comic book cuttings!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but however, when I was at this place this afternoon, the rude waiter would ASK you for the tips even I didn't wanna pay. Service needs to be improved."}
