{"text":"My husband and I stumbled on this place while exploring Old Montreal one day when we first moved here. We loved the view, so we decided to come back when our friend visited for some drinks on a Friday night. I called to make a reservation so that we would be sure to get a table, but I was told that I didn't need a reservation just to have drinks--we could just walk up to the terrace and go to the bar. When we arrived, the hostess told us that the upper deck was full, so she sat us at a table on the lower deck. It was still pretty with the lights, but I was a little disappointed because I had been hoping for a view of the Basilica while we sipped our drinks. We decided to make the best of it and enjoy the view we did have. All during our first round, people were leaving the upper deck and the hostess eventually started leading patrons who were just arriving up there to enjoy their drinks. After a while, she did come over to our table to tell us that she had space for us if we wanted to move, which made our night! We moved up to the upper deck and enjoyed the beautiful view of the Notre Dame Basilica while we enjoyed the next round of drinks. Just two small complaints. First of all, there were tons of bugs all over the tables on both decks, but if you want patio seating, that sort of comes with the territory. It seemed like they were attempting to wipe off the tables as frequently as possible. Secondly, it took quite a while for us to get waters and our second round of drinks. This wasn't a big deal to us, though, because we came up to the terrace for the atmosphere, so we just enjoyed our conversation while taking in the view. The drinks are pretty expensive, but that's typical of this part of Montreal. We love the atmosphere here and we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time I visited, my friend and I had a wonderful experience; drinks were great, food was warm and service was good.  However, when I decided to bring my boyfriend, it went sour. We didn't have a server, employees kept using the phrase: \"oh, no one has seen you yet\". It was busy, so that was understandable. Nevertheless we werent served water and the pitcher of sangria was a mixture of wine, orange juice, and simple syrup. Not sure where the Cointreau, Bacardi or whatever alcohols they used were, but it was flat out gross.   More than half of the menu was unavailable, so we settled. Yet, it took about 45 minutes for the cheese platter. This arrived with our meal despite asking for it as an entree.   The overall experience sucked despite the dope view."}
{"text":"Beautiful rooftop location, but overrated. Atmosphere is one of wait staff running by, tripping on chairs, and tight spaces. The Old Montreal Fashion was too sweet and isn't made with the liquor brands advertised on the website (meaning lower quality ingredients). Stop by and take a picture of the view, then leave to order a drink at a real bar."}
{"text":"Really great rooftop bar! Excellent location. Yummy drinks, though a bit pricey. (To be expected, paying for the location & view.) Two levels. We didn't order any food but the meat and cheese plates going by looked delicious! Staff was very friendly and attentive. Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. I would say the best rooftop spot in Montreal - we tried 3 total in the same day."}
{"text":"Pros: Great location, friendly service and a great hand-packed burger--the patty was lightly packed and delicate.  Cons: Weak cocktail, oil-soaked fries and the bacon on the BLT was practically just thick slaps of pure fat. The BLT was very tasty, but the bacon was so off-putting we couldn't finish it.  Aside from enjoying the nice weather, this lunch was a bust and left us hungry but with heavy, oil and fat-filled stomachs."}
{"text":"Very good hotel Generally great service with exception of primadonna receptionist in the Rainspa. Balcony rooms are large and fabulous. If you avoid the spa girl with the attitude, the place is really special."}
{"text":"CREDIT CARD USERS BEWARE. The bar staff here have a fraudulent scam going on. I used my card to pay for a drink, they stole it and gave me back an identical looking card, same bank, same expiry date, different name.   The thief maxed out my card immediately after with cash advances and purchases. Thankfully I only use a credit card with a very low limit in these types of situations but it could have been disastrous if the card had a higher limit.   Not to mention, the bar/scene was a little trashy so you're better off going elsewhere. We also went to the rooftop Terrasse at Hotel Nelligan which was much nicer!"}
{"text":"Sangria and a view. Not sure if new at time of visit but would recommend going back.   Unique view and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Droves of flying bugs were on this hotel rooftop which made it very difficult to relax and enjoy the gorgeous view of the Notre Dame Basilica. Could also use more comfortable seating.   Service was really attentive and I recommend the clear sangria (elderflower and strawberries word!)"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice rooftop bar. The cocktail list is well done and well executed, some creative cocktails including the green apple cucumber Gin- my favorite. A variety of Mojito's and they will customize. Drinks are not cheap- I would say $12-$15 a pop. But if you're looking for a cool place to hang out for a few cocktails the service is good, the view better, and the cocktails are pretty well-made."}
{"text":"Very expensive. All I had was drinks. They are average and not worth the price. Got 3 stars because of atmosphere and view."}
{"text":"This terrace on the roof of the westernmost building of the three that make up Place D'Armes hotel is the ideal place on a summer's night.  The view and al fresco location are unmatched. The food is a subset of that available on the main floor at 701, but it is a perfectly adequate set of choices. The salmon I had tonight was enjoyable if not transcendent.  Service is sincere and effective, and the overall experience, on a night like this, is wonderful."}
{"text":"Envie de manger au soleil en profitant d'une belle vue sur le vieux Montréal, faites-y une pause. J'y suis allé le midi, ils font un menu entrée+plat. C'est bien présenté ET cuisiné. Le service est très attentif. J'y retournerai"}
{"text":"I was in Canada on business last month and visited twice. Once just for drinks and another time for a drink and light bite to eat.  Great drink menu! A whole list of different flavored mojitos to choose from. I tried a watermelon and it was refreshing. Excellent charcuterie board, perfect for sharing. The brussels sprouts are also worth mentioning as they were delicious.   A lot of tables have a great view overlooking the area in front of the Norte Dame Basilica. A very comfortable, welcoming environment which is why I made my way here two times!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on the roof top. Went during the day once, and we had the whole roof to ourselves minus the staff. It was lovely. However, the wine selection lacked and the red wine was served very cold. Staff was absent-minded and not very customer service oriented."}
{"text":"Beautiful rooftop patio, the view alone is worth it. My fiancé and I ordered a pitcher of white cranberry sangria and a charcuterie board to share. Both fantastic and a perfect welcome to Montreal! Highly recommended on a sunny day to sip on refreshing drinks after a day of touring old Montreal."}
{"text":"Alright view, but the beers are warm and the snack plates were pretty crappy. The charcuterie was stale, the artichoke dip was just boring and tasted like sour cream with some garlic powder. The service is truly abominable- they all seem confused and slow. If you must be on a roof, fine. But you'll be frustrated with the wait times for anything you ask for and crap food."}
{"text":"Where to start..... Only had 2 beers on tap, apparently out of others on menu. Ordered 3 beers, literally tepid, room temp. Blah..... So then start looking around. View is fine, not great and the place isn't particularly clean. May look better in the dark, but at sunset it was needing a bit of spiffing up. Oh well, off to the next bar terrace. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I visited this bar for late night drinks with friends after a full day of attending a conference for work. It was the perfect place to unwind. We had a great view of the city and the cocktails were great. We only wished they were open a bit later. They closed at midnight and they started turning off the lights and shutting things down around 11:50. It was a Sunday night, but on a warm summer evening we would have loved to stay longer."}
{"text":"This place has such a datey datey vibe. It'll totally motivate you to find someone so you can take him/her here out on a date. It's on the rooftop of a hotel and overlooks the city of Montreal. If you're seated at a table facing the West, you have this gorgeous view of the sunset also. They also have an extensive choice of mojitos and selection of cocktails. Their cheeseboards look pretty damn awesome too. Whether it's a fun get together with friends or a romantic date, this place hits the jackpot when it comes to ambiance.   Another side note: there's a DJ. Bonus!  My only complaint would probably be the amount of bugs this place attracts. It can be distracting sometimes but it cracked up a few jokes also."}
{"text":"I'm lost for words for reviewing this place. Was difficult finding the terrace,so make sure you ask where the elevator is plus walking one flight on stairs..The service was good. We had the shoulder steak with sweet potato purée which was excellent , enjoyed that. The view is really just ok. We were blocked by building all around ..  It's  a good place to eat  if you are looking for a  rooftop terrace."}
{"text":"OK so I have been these four tresses Nelligan, William Gray, Place D'Armes, and Sur L'Auberge.  They are all within 5min walk of each other and all almost the same, I wonder if they are operated by the same company?  Here is my dilemma, the settings are great for all of them nice view and good ambiance, the food and drinks however severely lacking especially for the price! So I am ranking Neligan as the best (4 stars) - best drinks and ambiance! The other 3 all get three stars because...15 dollars a drink and it tastes like they poured a premade cocktail mix... and the food is very lacking $20 dollar lobster role on a chewy dry hot dog bun with little scraps of lobster claw! Although I should say that the drinks and bartender quality is better at Neligan and so is the ambiance! I will post the same review for all four places."}
{"text":"Visited this spot while in Montreal and wanted to get a good view of the city. I had found this place on Pinterest and bookmarked it on my Yelp as well. View did not disappoint at all! For drinks we only had beers but they were good and the service was great. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Comfy aerial nest and cool air! Got a bottle of rosé and the charcuterie to share, it was really worth the price. Authentic tasty grilled chorizo, coming with sausage and peppered jamon among other stuff while enjoying sunset lights over the pretty close but not oppressing neighbouring buildings. The place gets quickly crowdy at night when the weather is friendly tho!"}
{"text":"Great location and views, classy and relaxing (priced at the upper end). We had the cheese&fruit platter and red sangria. Cheese was excellent, but the red sangria was nothing special. We have sangria often and have a decent understanding of what's good. This sangria was very watered down (or at least tasted that way). We asked them to put in more wine, but still tasted like flavored water. Finally we had to return it. To their credit they did so without a fuss and were apologetic, then they made up for it with a couple great mixed drinks. Would recommend, but hold the sangria."}
{"text":"Beautiful Diner at this place. View on the Basilic and old town pretty good.  Waiter was nice and we really enjoyed the beef in the red wine. Food and drinks was really really good ! But honestly too much wasps ... That's why i take off one star."}
{"text":"Utsikten från denna terrassrestaurang är deras främsta tillgång. Maten var ok, men de avslöjar sin  okunskap (fantasilöshet?) när det gäller att laga mar när de använder samma såser till både lammkotletterna och till steken. Saggiga pommes frites. Tog också väldigt lång tid att få in maten. Svag 3:a."}
{"text":"I call at 20h50 to ask if they take reservations for terrace and if they are open I will be there in 30 min . Answer \"we are open, you are welcome, just come and if there is seats we have drinks and snacks.\"  I come at 21h25 and I m told sorry the terrace is closed it s cold. I explain my situation ask for a menager and no satisfaction. Bad service and really bad attitude. PS\" not easy to park a car in the area\"   Just avoid, they should learn how to train they employees and how to deal with costumers."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon upon this restaurant after asking 2 locals for the best place for an afternoon lunch. They suggested we take advantage of the beautiful weather and eat at \" La Terrace.\" This was the perfect choice! The ambiance alone was amazing. We wanted to have the true Canadian experience so we ordered \"Poutine. It taste way better than it looks. You have to try it at least once .The sangria with white wine was amazing, a nice drink to have on a summer day. The burgers were also good along with the fries. Overall I highly recommend this place when in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Really nice patio with excellent service on the top of the Place des Armes Hotel. On a mild or warm afternoon, the patio teems with guests. Enter through the main level hotel restaurant. Signs or staff will direct you to the elevator leading to the terrace on the 8th floor.  The terrace has good views, depending on where you sit. Also, you might end up in a sunny or shady side of the patio, so renember your sunglasses. There are bar seats, as well as high top and regular tables.  The cocktail prices here are in the 12-16$ range. The red wine sangria was particularly good (14$).  The only drawback here was the presence of both bees and flies. After battling the yellow jackets at the bar, the staff graciously seated me at a table."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the view, which is absolutely beautiful, and the white sangria & mini burgers. The service was absolutely horrible--it wasn't even that busy and we still waiting over 30 min for our drinks and food. I could tell our server was trying to keep his cool, but he was not professional at all and we had to go upstairs to get our checks sorted out. He messed up my check and over-billed me. They need to be more organized and timely."}
{"text":"Mon nouvel endroit fétiche à Montréal! Cette terrasse est tout simplement fantastique! Il y a en masse de place pour ben du monde et la vue est IN-CRO-YABLE. Je capote encore et j'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner!   Que ce soit avant d'aller manger à la brasserie 701 ou encore juste pour profiter du beau temps, je vous suggère FORTEMENT cet endroit !   Je suis sous le charme,"}
{"text":"Nice setting on top of the hotel Place d'Armes. The view is better depending on where you sit.  The drinks are very good...Although pricey ($15/mojito). The price of food seems to be a lot more decent.   It used to be once upon a time a lot more busy than my recent visit on a Friday.  If you don't mind paying more for your drinks and want a rooftop terrasse,  this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Fantastic ambience. OK staff. I went in with a friend on a weekday, and because we were early, we got a good table. Our server wasn't very enthused about giving recommendations, and kept asking whether we wanted any more drinks, and decided to bring our checks after just two drinks. She was OK, but what I'll take away from the terrace would always be the view not the service."}
{"text":"Another roof top terrace in Old Montreal that features beautiful views towards Notre Dame church and intriguing sangria list.  That was the last stop of our terrace tour and we arrived around 11:30pm. There was a good number of people queueing to get in and if the place was not on the list to visit I wouldn't have waited. The line was managed with as less coordination as possible. People were leaving the bar, but for whatever reason nobody from the personnel knew if there are free tables on the top part of the terrace and if they are ready for new clients. The service was not very accomodating, the young ladies looked like they work in an office doing serious tasks, rather then offering drinks with a smile to their customers. Last comment, avoid tables just next to the bathroom.   I regret I had time for only one magic ginger sangria, it was my green day, meaning no driving, so I had to catch a bus. The ginger sangria had chunks of ginger and ginger beer, giving a spicy twist to the drink, some coriander to balance out the spiciness, and good amount of alcohol. Absolutely delicious!   I think this place would be best at happy hour time when there is a light and you can enjoy in details the architecture of the surrounding buildings. I'm definitely coming back for more of my new sangria love, Gingergrita!"}
{"text":"Awesome city views, especially of the Cathedral. Trendy and sophisticated atmosphere. Great place for a cocktail and light bites on a sunny summer day!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight, the highlight is definitely the view and that's saying a lot because I would have gave this place a lower rating. The service is horrible, took them over 20 min to ask if we wanted a drink and the place wasn't that packed. We took a white sangria which was very average, overpriced and also tasted watered down.We also bought a couple kroenenbourg which were phenomenal.   The price is average, range from 7-12 for beers. I would come back just for the view. Beautiful"}
{"text":"Out of all the terraces that we have been to in Montreal, this place is hands down the best one!  It is located in the Place D'armes Hotel, on the top floor. The view is absolutely breathtaking and drinks -- the strawberry sangria especially -- are so so so delish.  I would recommend making a reservation or showing up at not so busy times as the spot is rather small and busy. The ambiance is very eclectic and you get to see Notre Dame while sipping and eating. Try their poutine and cheese board if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere, unlike the regular hotel bars of this type. Very tasty bites, great wine by-the-glass, and nice cocktail selection. Very friendly staff. Will definitely come back here next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"I would go back just for the view. They told us the wait would be 15 min but we ended up getting seated right away. I ordered the mango Hennessy basil cocktail. It was sweet but good. My only complaint was that my friend ordered a Mystique cider and it was warm so he sent it back ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was great, the food wasn't bad, but the service was. Our server had a bit of an attitude and he took a very long time to bring us the bill at the end. That was a disappointment. I also got a Coke and it had no flavor or carbonation and I told him this saying there must be something wrong with the machine and he came back and told me nothing was wrong with the machine. Ok, well, something's wrong because Coke is not just brown water lol.  I don't really drink myself, but I'd only recommend coming here for drinks. Maybe some appetizers if you were feeling hungry, but probably go somewhere else for dinner. There are a lot of restaurants in Montreal, don't settle for this one."}
{"text":"A great view of the Square in front of the Basilica. Nice rooftop atmosphere, with great drinks and food.  If you want to get above the tourist fray, and have an upscale experience this should be on your list.  Located on the back edge of the Old Town. A quick and easy walk from most hotels."}
{"text":"Food, service, and view all great and wonderful!!!  A rare find to get all three at the same place.  Cheeseboard has a healthy portion of 4 wonderful cheeses complete with crispy baguette.  Organic salmon was just great not farm raised and not over done or with too much salt.  Waitstaff hip and dressed in a nautical theme that was pleasant to the eye but also serious to please."}
{"text":"Dommage que les portions sont insultantes par rapport aux prix ... les frites brulés . Anyways le service est bon et la vue agreable mais qualité rapport prix decevant ... il y a de la place à l'amelioration surtout la musique forte et agressante en pleine heure de lunch ..."}
