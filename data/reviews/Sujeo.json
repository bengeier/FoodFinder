{"text":"I have now eaten at Sujeo twice, once dining in and once via take out. Although the food was pretty delicious, I felt as though it was extremely overpriced. I ordered the chicken wings, which were quite flavorful, but lacked the substance expected from a $15 plate. Additionally, when I dined in, the service was extremely slow and our waiter was somewhat rude. One thing to keep in mind is that they are closed on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, and both times it's been really tasty. Good ramen, friendly staff. Seems under the radar so far, so not too busy."}
{"text":"The ramen is probably the best in Madison. Light years ahead of Umami and its underachieving step-brother Tavernakaya. It's all down to their noodles, however. Very chewy and full if not quite a bit too short in length. Ultimately, the other components in each bowl are average. It's a salt ramen, and I really wish it were a tonkotsu broth instead. Dudes at the noodle bar were aghast that I could possibly ask if tonkotsu were an option. No, clearly the chef has made his or her mind up!  Ultimately, I think a miso ramen is great if you have 100% bang on ingredients, but those are hard to come by in Madison it seems. Perhaps if the chef took advantage of all the tasty pork and beef around it might be easier to make a coherent tonkotsu bowl. For now, it's still the go to place if I can convince myself to pay moderately exorbitant prices for above average ramen.  Lastly, props to attempting a noodle bar. It's pretty cool. But clearly you're missing the key component of having the people BEHIND the counter serve the food up. The noodle bar is for fast in, fast out. I don't want to deal with a server who comes and goes and takes forever because they effectively have TWO restaurants to deal with. I know you can figure out a better way! And if you pull it off, maybe people other than myself will want to sit there."}
{"text":"Ice noodles were amazing, in fact the noodle bar menu is quite good.  The restaurant menu stretches itself a little too thin and does not deliver.  Low point is bahn mi, which is really really americanized.  Remember the bahn mi at the Haze?  That was fucking awesome.  Will def be back though, great new lunch spot on the east side."}
{"text":"Man, I hate to write this.    First let me say that my server was awesome.  She was super attentive and had a great attitude.  She was probably the best part about the experience, unfortunately.   I had the potstickers and the pork curry.  The potstickers were okay, but definitely not the best I have ever had.  The meat was very dry and that made them hard to consume.  Although, I did like the sauce they came with.    The pork curry was so salty that this morning I can barely make a fist because my fingers are so swollen.  I couldn't really taste the pork or the other ingredients in the food because the sauce was so overpowering.  Even cutting it with some rice wasn't enough to save the dish.    I am really disappointed.  For a place that has reviews which usually say \"I had to wait over an hour for a table,\" I am left feeling like \"for what?\" I was expecting to be knocked out of the park with food that I couldn't make at home, but I definitely Charlie Brown walked out of the restaurant at the end of the night.    I'll give Sujeo another shot.  Maybe this was a fluke and I have to imagine that there is something better.   Look for an update!"}
{"text":"Inventive and tasty take on Korean food.  I've enjoyed every meal I've had in the restaurant proper,  but for me and my schedule it's all about the late night noodle bar. They've usually got a really interesting take on a traditional Ramen as their special and it hasn't disappointed yet! Personal favorites include a Cheeseburger Ramen and a Grilled Cheese Tomato Soup Ramen. And you can't beat the old school beats they play.  Perfect atmosphere"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to coming here, but were disappointed. The dumplings and imperial rolls were very good, but everything else we tried was lacking. The egg rolls had too much cabbage and not enough flavor. The khao soi had good flavor BUT was so spicy it was borderline inedible. A woman at the next table also ordered it and felt the same way, even saying she'd ordered it before and it wasn't that spicy. Must have been a mix-up in the kitchen. The bun cha deluxe was flavorless, just a bunch of shredded vegetables. The custard had good flavor but was grainy. A must after the khao soi, however, just to cool down the mouth. Very disappointing. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the fact that the ingredients are super-fresh and local.  That's not something that asian restaurants usually boast which has kept me on the fence for years.  It was my first visit.  My partner and I shared an egg roll (not a scary deep fried puck) but a delicious, lightly battered and crispy with fresh cabbage, tender shrimp.  I've always loved shrimp, but shrimp in eggrolls can be scary, rubbery and disgusting- not here though.  It's really thoughtfully executed.  We also shared the Bibimbap and the BBQ pork noodles.  Both were REALLY good.  Saw other guests eating the sticky bun thing and the hot pot- both looked delicious.  Can't wait to return and try more!"}
{"text":"Pt. 1  Paid $22 for Tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet), a half full box of white rice, and what tasted like box miso soup. In Seoul this meal is served exactly as it was at Sujeo, except there it's served in the Korean equivalent of a diner for $3 US. This dish at Sujeo was the equivalent of an American restaurant in Korea serving hotdogs for $20 bucks a pop. It's one thing if you put a unique gourmet spin on a classic dish. It's another to just take advantage of people's ignorance.  pt.2  Sujeo was nice enough to offer me a gift card, so I gave it another shot and ordered the General Tso Chicken Livers and a side Thai Egg Salad to go. Great choices. The Tso spin on the livers was delicious and the egg salad was fresh and interesting - unlike any Thai dish I've encountered in Madison (not to mention the box of rice was full this time). While the Tonkatsu was disappointing, Sujeo definitely seems to have some worthwhile selections.  I look forward to trying more."}
{"text":"It took me a while to decide between 3 or 4 stars for this one. After much thought 3.5 would be the best option. I have been looking forward to visiting even before they open. Sujeo has garnered loads of reviews in the recent months of opening. The less than stellar reviews made me put off my visit for a bit, but a good friend convinced me to give it a shot, so here I am =)  When we went for lunch they weren't very busy, b/c we were they early and it was also just before Christmas. I had the shio ramen which I quite like.   I like: - duck fat in the ramen broth, giving it a nice texture - pork belly: nice and well-seasoned, though some pieces were overly done and were kind of tough - wheat noodles, took a little getting used to at the beginning but was good -soft poached eggs! The best part, runny yolk with soft whites ~~ - flavorful broth  Not so like: -broth was a tad too salty for me, would have loved to finish the entire broth but it was esp difficult after I'd polished off the noodles  Their custard ice cream is the best part. I have friends who's said to go to Sujeo just for the custard ice cream. They change the flavors regularly, we had a choice of blackcurrant or cherry vanilla. Love the blackcurrant ice cream! $3 a cone is totally worth it, even in the Wisconsin winter!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely blown away. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a meal this much.  They have a new menu and it can be a little confusing. The first section is labled Biggie/smalls which I can appreciate  (RIP Christopher Wallace)  but that section is a mixture of appetizers and sharing dishes. The highly recommend the Korean broasted chicken \"KBC\" it's a spicy lightly fried chicken. Also you have to get the Dan Dan, Spicy ground pork, cilantro, udon noodles in a peanut sauce. Order lots of small dishes and share. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This was my second time being here, and like the first time their DdukBokGi (Korean rice dumpling), was delicious. So we ordered a bunch of other things, which turned out rather flavorless and boring. I mean Sujeo does utilize great ingredients, and very fresh local produce, and that is great. However everything tasted bland, besides the DdukBokGi. If you are Korean, avoid this place, however if you had never eaten Korean food, this might be great for you."}
{"text":"Service? Amaze.  Food? Oh my heavens. Yes. We ordered a hodgepodge of items and loved every single one of them."}
{"text":"Sujeo is lackluster. I've been here several times and have tried more than a dozen dishes and most of it was disappointing. I did like the tongue salad and the crispy Thai egg, both delicious. KBC was tasty, but lacking in Korean influence. Otherwise, the richness of the chicken livers and really all of their rice dishes are not balanced out (I say this as someone who likes rich food). I'm picky about noodle dishes, but I thought maybe Sujeo would change my mind. I tried the Shio ramen and was not impressed.  Suejo is a trendy joint and you might very well have a good time here, but I wouldn't seek it out for its food."}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us came here specifically for Dim Sum service after hearing about Sujeo from a friend. We had to wait one hour for our table.  Typically, this is good for a business since it means they are busy/making money. They have a good system of texting you when your table is ready so we were able to go elsewhere during our wait. Upon getting seated, we were presented with a dim sum cart and then we got 2 cups of water for our group of 5.  Normally, each person gets their own cup of water.  The server informed us that each bamboo container of food costs $5. After we chose a few dishes, we finished each dish and proceeded to wait until the next cart came around.  This took half an hour, only now when they came, we were then informed that dim sum cart service has stopped and it was provided on an order basis. We were allowed time to see what we wanted to order...and when we ordered, we waited another hour for the food.  When I went to the restroom during this time, I heard one of the waiters inform the woman who seemed to be running the floor that dim sum cart service was back on per the chefs request.  At the end of our hour-long wait, the food still did not arrive and we decided to leave and just pay for what we already ate.  In addition to this, the wait staff/hostess seemed disinterested and unprepared.  Waters were not refilled the entire time we were there and staff members seemed to be getting a lot of questions about the lack of cart service from other patrons.  Even the woman who appeared to run the floor was speaking to the wait staff with increased volume.  Positive things: we were not charged anything for our dissatisfaction.  The interior is very nice and has a nice upscale feeling to it.  The realization that they do not specialize in ONLY Dim Sum service; we will have to try their non-Dim Sum dining service to get the full picture.  To be honest, this restaurant caters to Caucasian Americans who enjoy hyping up Asian-style food service and cuisine with disposable income.  For the Dim Sum service, there is a lot to be learned and improved upon."}
{"text":"Food was good (but not the best Ramen in Madison) but the service was TERRIBLE! We had to flag down a server because ours never came to check on us and after an hour of waiting for our food and watching all the people around us (who arrived after us) finish their food, we thought it was odd we were still waiting. Our waitress finally came after we asked another server to go get her and then she said the order never went in and retook our order. We then waited another 20 minutes before it came out. Meanwhile, we had to flag down people to ask for water refills. I'm not one to ever complain (it makes me super uncomfortable), but this service was beyond unacceptable. We weren't rude about the mishap but our server continued to avoid our table the rest of the night and it wasn't until we asked to speak to a manager after our bill came that she even offered to do anything to make up for the terrible experience."}
{"text":"The flavor, quantity, and quality of the food just does not match the price and ambience purported by Sujeo. I ordered General Tso's Chicken Livers and Dan Dan noodles. Though it was average at best, to pay $15 for the General Tso chicken was far too high for the flavor and quantity. Other than a mixture of liver, thigh, and sweetbread, there just was no difference from your typical $7 Chinese takeout (except you get twice as much elsewhere!) Very, very disappointed. Not much spice level-- typical General Tso sauce.   The Dan Dan noodles delivered more quantity, but there was nothing to them in terms of spice or sweetness. There just wasn't an identity to them. Usually, for Dan Dan noodles with pork, I'd like to have my mouth burning and my nose running. There was absolutely zero spice level for these-- which can be OK if there is a sweet flavor or different textures. Unfortunately, it was just pork and noodles with a little (chili?) oil.   I was definitely underwhelmed, and won't be back."}
{"text":"For a resturant that doesn't serve lunch because they want to concentrate on their dimsum, noodle bar and late night stuff, it's quite disappointing.  The dim sum was cold and lacks varieties.  The cart rarely came by and when it does, there are usually only two to three items; again, all cold by the time it gets around.  I guess I expected too much having had dim sum in places in Chicago, San Francisco, and Toronto.     There is one positive experience, I did enjoy the salt and pepper squid.    $56 for two people plus a stop at chain burger joint to fill up makes this a forgettable experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the ramen bowl and the broth was completely inedible. It tasted like water and oil. They didn't have any additional condiments like soy sauce or salt and pepper on the table. It took another 15 minutes to flag someone down to get some soy sauce.   For $12 bucks it was a total rip off. Not only was it inauthentic but it was not even palatable without copious amounts of condiments.   If you're looking for good and cheaper noodles, go to Umami or Ha Long Bay instead."}
{"text":"Because Yelp is asking me what I DO like I'm going to post a couple positive reviews...starting with Sujeo. I've had some hilarious service at this place which makes me want to give it 3.5 but Yelp won't let me. I'm pretty sure that one time our server was tripping on some form of psychedelic or maybe was just really hungover...he couldn't remember anything about the specials (which we forgave him for) but he also didn't know a whole lot about menu standards as well...always courteous and attentive service though.  The good: Inventive and alluring food and drink. Plays on standards hit the right notes...Protein is always cooked to perfection and the drinks impress (although if you're sitting in the noodle bar they usually take longer than you'd like).   I've been here for lunch and dinner and have never had a disappointing meal. (I did crash down pretty hard on a weird piece of tendon or something once that I thought ruined my front teeth but fortunately it didn't...and the manager was very good about the situation. She gave me her card if there was any future dental problem.)   If you're an experienced eater you'll enjoy this place and if you have relatives who aren't sure about \"foreign food\" this is a good place to break them in.   There have been times when the exhaust hood in the kitchen wasn't functioning correctly (more likely the switches were mixed) and the noodle bar fills with creosote fumes. Not just aroma from the kitchen but really gnarly smoke and fumes. Hoping they have gotten that under control."}
{"text":"Dont go here if you want to try korean. Food is far from what korean food is supposed to be. I dont buy the fusion stuff either. I ordered jap chae and the noodles came out soggy and over cooked. Wonder what they were trying to fuse it with such that even the noodles did not come out right. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is usually very good. Recently had the late night noodle bar special ramen, which looked beautiful, but flavor was slightly bland. Nevertheless, I slurped it all up due to the fresh quality ingredients. Will try the house standard ramen next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place because I read a Yelp review informing me that they play Vince Staples Pandora!   So not only do they have great music, their food is also amazing!  Win win."}
{"text":"This place is completely overrated. It's a Korean infused Noodles & Company at best. It blows my mind to hear that people are waiting almost 2 hours to eat here. Don't waste your time and money. Madison has way better to offer."}
{"text":"I finally tried Sujeo with some friends. Overall, we enjoyed our dinners, and had great service. The kohlrabi salad was quite nice. However, the mango curry people seem to like was way too sweet. They add palm sugar, which, while not white sugar, is still sugar. The problem is the dish already includes sweet squashes and sweet mango, so no additional sugar is needed. The sauce is already made, so you cannot request it to be less sweet. Others enjoyed a special and a cold noodle dish. I don't suppose we can ever hope for sticky brown rice."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have never had a bad experience! Everything is to die for. My absolute favorite is the Vegetable Fried Rice, but others include the Mango Curry, Apple & Beetroot Salad, and more! They are very accommodating with vegetarian & vegan options as well as other allergies & they are always happy to answer questions."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Bland flavors. Greasy. I've tried Sujeo three times, different items, and did not enjoy any; I won't be returning again. Ichiban Sichuan may not have the atmosphere but, the food is a million times better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dining at Sujeo. The staff was very friendly, although I thought it was peculiar that someone who was not my server asked to take my dessert order. I like the personal touch of one person taking my order, checking in, etc., so that definitely threw me off.   I enjoyed the food that I ate, but I thought the Brussels sprouts were too salty. I would definitely return to dine again."}
{"text":"The most beautiful delivery food i have ever received. Beef was very flavorful and perfectly cooked. Pickled radishes and homemade sauces were amazing."}
{"text":"High points: cocktails, KBC (Korean broasted chicken--literally THE BEST CHICKEN I HAVE EVER HAD), miso soup, rotating custard, foie gras bibimbap (it's a special but we always ask if they have it just in case), and the service  Low points: ramen (I don't know why but the ramen is not up to snuff), long waits when it's busy, not open late  I still gave this place 5 stars because it so thoroughly satisfies a niche. The vast majority of the menu is consistently amazing, the cocktails are so freaking delicious I almost wish they made non-alcoholic versions, and I just love hanging out here. This place is my Cheers."}
{"text":"What an absolute disappointment.  Two of us went for lunch on a Sunday.  We were fine with the limited lunch menu but found the food we ordered to be just plain bad.  We had the chicken ramen soup and it was grossly over salted and extremely greasy.  We left, with about 3/4 of the dish left.  In addition, the service was surprisingly cool.  When we tried to make a food substitution in a dish, we were told no,and the reason given was pretty lame. I wanted to like the place, and was excited to try it.  It has all the trappings of hip and cool.  Unfortunately, it did not have the food to go along with it.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"The quality of their food varies a lot, which is unreasonable because they are kind of expensive"}
{"text":"Sat in Noodle Bar side and had the Bun Cha rice noodle dish and it was excellent.  The Korean sausage from Underground kitchen is delish and a nice combo of flavors."}
{"text":"We stopped in to the noodle bar for a late lunch but walked out minutes later. The hip hop music was blaring and we made two requests that it be turned quieter. An employee finally turned it down a bit, but not so much that we couldn't hear the f-bombs coming out of the speakers overhead. We were the only customers so the staff member was clearly saying that his listening preferences were more important than creating a pleasant environment for us."}
{"text":"Love love love this place- get the Ddeokbokki, a spicy, creamy rice cake dish that gets its creaminess from cheese. The rice cakes are consistency of much larger rice noodles and are the perfect vessel for the amazing sauce. Could not stop eating this. Also loved the curry chicken soup- khao soi. The broth was complex, spicy, and delicious...chicken falling off the bone, chewy wonton noodles, and crisp fried noodles on top. Loved that there's vegetarian options as well as GF and pescetarian too on the menu.   Everything we tried was super yummy and perfect for a cold winter night. Keep it coming Sujeo, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent top quality food.  We've been here several times and had great food and service.  Get the Dan Dan, or Phat hot basil!"}
{"text":"On Friday night, after a lovely round of drinks at Robinia Courtyard, a group of friends and I had a hankering for Sujeo.  We walked across the street and wandered in to the restaurant at 8:30 PM.  The hostess informed my friend that she couldn't seat the six of us for dinner- not \"there's a wait,\" but that we would not be able to be seated for dinner.  Dumbfounded, I looked around the dining room and saw that several of their huge booths only contained 2 people- one only had 1 person seated in it!- these booths can accommodate 6-8. The restaurant wasn't overflowing by any means- it looked like there were a few parties finishing their meals; nobody else was waiting for a table; the bar was about half full.  Yet she explained, in a disinterested, unapologetic manner, that their dinner menu ended at 9, and our only option was to wait 45 minutes to an hour and then order from what she described as their limited late night noodle bar menu.  Since several in our party had dietary restrictions, the noodle bar menu didn't work for us, so we left, hungry and dismayed.    It pains me to write negative reviews, but I found the whole experience so confusing and inappropriate. Confusing because this is a Tory Miller restaurant and I would expect the highest standard of food and service (a la Graze). Inappropriate because a hipster noodle bar appealing to a young professional crowd (given its location and press) shouldn't feature country club hours or attitude. A restaurant serving dinner til 9 should seat for dinner until 9. (and a restaurant in Madison might rethink starting a \"late night\" menu at 9 PM on a Friday) An experienced floor manager would not have filled every large table with ridiculously small parties.  Moreover, there were various ways they could have tried to accommodate us (for instance my friend noted that two people seated in one of the big booths were clearly staffers who were eating after their shift, and there was enough room for us at the bar) but nobody there seemed remotely interested in having us stay for dinner. Which strikes me as downright bizarre; we probably would have spend around $150 altogether.    I've been to Sujeo about a dozen times and had varying experiences... their noodle dishes are fine, the atmosphere is cool, I do think it tends to be more greasy/oily than I'd expect.  I love Graze, so I want to love Sujeo. But I'm certain we never would have been treated so dismissively at Graze.  Because Sujeo is not downtown or along a busy dining corridor i.e. Willy Street or Monroe I have to make an effort to go. Friday night's poor service was a disappointment that will prevent me from returning."}
{"text":"Sujeo, the only Korean restaurant that charges you for banchan.  Banchan is the traditional small, communal side dishes served along with Korean cuisine. It's practically eaten at every meal in Korea. It's revered and standard, not meant to be served as an appetizer.  Ok rant over.  We ordered the egg roll ($4), potstickers ($8), bibimbap ($18), shio ramen ($12), and lychee soft serve ($4?).  The prices are excessive. I get that everything is locally sourced and everything was raised in a nice, socially responsible suburb, and came from a respectable family blah blah blah, but come on!  This is not what Korean food is about, I'm not saying everything needs to be overflowing but something that's meant as comfort food should be hearty, not skimpy.  The egg roll is the biggest perpetrator on the menu. At $4, it's one lump fried wonton wrapped indistinguishable shredded cabbage and I don't know what else. The pot stickers were a better value, came with 5 for the price tag. The wrappers were thick and the fillings formed a small ball in the middle so each bite was not uniformly.  The shio ramen had a very weak broth, not rich or buttery and lacked depth.The ramen was bouncy, still slurp-able. The bibimbap thankfully was served in a hot stone pot, came with bulgogi (BBQ beef), kimchi, sauteed spinach, and (way) over easy egg. The egg was too runny and could not be saved by placing it against the hot stone pot to cook it a little more. The Gochujang (spicy korean sauce) that's typically present with this dish was replaced with a anemic generic KimKim Korean Hot Sauce. If you know and treasure the flavors of Gochujang as I do, you might even be offended by this as I was. This had more of a strong vinegar tone, was watery and something that resembled kimchi brine.     This is at best a \"dressed up\" Korean fusion restaurant meant to be hip without sustenance - to ooh and ahh the Midwesterners - giving them a gentle introduction to Korean cuisine, and disguising its self as something that cannot be replicated from one's ajumma's (auntie in Korean) kitchen."}
{"text":"I was craving dumplings/pot stickers so i picked Sujeos over Dumplinghaus...wrong choice. The atmosphere was nice and quiet. The servers were friendly and quick to provide service as well. I settled for the dimsum...and it was a disappointment. Dimsum is SUPPOSED to be fresh and warm...THIS dimsum came out without a hint of steam and the wax paper at the bottom of each bamboo plate was crispy-dry. I suppose i can't blame the place since dimsum wasn't their specialty....but i'm sure another minute in the microwave would've done some good for the dimsum. I honestly didn't expect much when i walked into an all-caucasian staffed \"asian\" restaurant. I forgot to mention, but i did get complimentary room temp tea... I recommend the restaurant microwave their dimsum for just a few mins longer.;) same goes for the tea."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Sujeo as I love it's sister restaurants. The food was mediocre. The drinks were okay. The saddest part of my experiences here was the lackluster decor--- I think they may have hired the same people who designed a Chipotle or a Noodles... it's just very generic with poor colors and wood choices in a space that could have been much more. The service was also only mediocre."}
{"text":"After much hype, Sujeo is just \"meh\". The atmosphere needs to work. If you walk in the front door (facing Washington) you have no idea where to go and are in the middle of the dining room. The wait staff seemed to be in a huge hurry, even though there was no wait, and I had to ask to order drinks because we were never offered.   The kohlrabi salad was delicious! As a vegetarian, it was nearly impossible to get a veggie entree. Yes, they offer one, but when you are at a table of all vegetarians, that means you ALL get the same dish. Sigh.   Will I be back? Probably not. There are so many great places in town for Asian cuisine, so I will likely pass on spending $30 per person for a drink and noodle bowl."}
{"text":"I so badly wanted to like Sujeo, but it is not that good. Very sad to say but it seems like they are trying too hard. The genius of ramen, hot pots, bibimbap, etc is in the simplicity of the dishes, fresh ingredients, and allowing each of the flavors to shin on their own. With the dishes at Sujeo, everything is on fire with an excess of kimchi and an abundance of umami. The salt and pepper squid is really just fried calamari and would have tasted better if it came as the menu indicated, as unbreaded calamari with salt and pepper.  Good concept but needs better execution."}
{"text":"I brought my two girls, 2 and 9. They waited patiently for dinner. And waited and waited and waited, for an hour and a half. Drinks took 45 minutes to arrive. Drinks... I think kids should be exposed to versatile restaurants. It gives them the opportunity to learn how to behave in public and be exposed to new foods, but waits like that are ridiculous. We had reservations, we were seated immediately, it was all on the waitstaff and the kitchen.   Also, our server, Lauren Oberle-hall, was unengaged and, I hate to say it, incompetent. We sat and waited to be watered and greeted after being seated. And waited, and waited (see a theme here?).Our order was incorrect, she brought Dan Dan Noodles and I had ordered Chinese BBQ Pork Noodles. She took it back and the BBQ Noodles took 45 minutes to come out. Drinks took 45 minutes, and I watched them slowly melt on the side of the bar. Having none of it, I asked the host if she could check if they were ours. They were. The egg rolls app came with our dinner, and the food took forever to come out.   All of this with just me and two small children. I feel like a super mom after keeping the kids cool during that dinner from hell."}
{"text":"3.5 review  Went here with 2 friends for an eating adventure, inspired by S.Korean Olympics.   Atmosphere: daytime, bistro-bar scene, lunchtime. 4/5 Service: Prompt, but slowed over the course. 3.5/5 Portions: 9x5 inch plate = big plate. Diet coke is per can.  Pork and shrimp potstickers - panfried, soft, filling is a good amount, fell apart a little in the dipping sauce. Medium salt. Don't forget about the shrimp flavor. 3/5  Fried Brussel sprouts and kale - they picked off each leaf from the brussel sprout and then fired it. The kale is paper crispy. I absolutely hate both of these ingredients, but in this dish, I like them. As my friend said, \"it tastes like a funyon!\" 5/5  Sweet potato bao - I really wanted dimsum, but the closest I could do here was a bao. After reading yelp reviews, I steered away from the chicken skin and went with sweet potato. WOW! Very unique and yummy. The potato was smooshed and in some sweet red sauce (like a \"duck sauce\" from Chinese takeout, but better). There were kimchi pickles, kewpie mayo (watch out MSG), and cilantro all between two fluffy baos (here: looks like sandwich top and bottom, but the same bao texture). Wanted more than two. 4/5  Drunken noodles - says spicy, but they can accommodate \"not\" spicy. I asked for \"like a level one,\" and I got it. I could have handled one more hit of spice, but this was good without it. Wide noodles give some carb chew during the winter, and the shrimp are perfectly cooked with a touch of fried to crisp up the edges. The sauce has ground pork bits in it, which gave a nice flavor, but also added grease. My first drunk noodle but I liked it. My friends decided they did not like it because of a \"fishy\" hint. There was a little flavor of fish or oyster sauce in it, but I didn't mind it. And the shrimp were NOT the cause of the \"fishy\" flavor - they were perfect. 4/5  Dan Dan noodles - basically a pad thai. 3.5/5  Japchae - interesting. I usually hate glass noodles. They just look wrong, like that guy at the bar you have to side-eye all night. But everyone raves about them here and thankfully our group was adventurous enough to try it. First off, they use a thick bacon. So wham... you get a meaty, salty, smoky flavor on everything: noodles, veggies, and meat. Seriously, this dish is a 4x4 to your mouth. The veggies are chargrilled tasting and funny enough, this dish had the most veggies of anything we ordered: shitake mushrooms, peppers, onions, garlic, and ginger finely chopped. It was overly salty for me, but overall, the most interesting dish. 3.5/5   Sujeo was a good lunch. Maybe it's not the best in Madison, but it tasted darn good to us. I think the biggest downfall is the price. I know I can get \"darn good\" at some other places in town, for less salt and cheaper."}
{"text":"This place seemed nice and pretty cool. It's very clean and the decor is cool. The seating seemed spaced apart and there was plenty of room. Service was quite slow... with 4-5 guys in the kitchen area, it was still pretty slow. There were only 10 people and the menu wasn't too big at night... so, I'm not sure... it took a while to cook noodles I guess.  The wonton cheese sticks were good and the sauce was good too! I was excited! I thought my noodle dishes were going to be amazing.  Omg... the broth was so bland. I had to ask for soy sauce just so I could at least have some flavour besides water and spice. I ordered the Veggie Ramen and my date ordered the Spring Ramen... I guess his was extremely fishy and bland as well.  If any of you have been to Ha Long Bay for their Pho, that my friends, is flavour or if you'd made some of your own Top Ramen, that my friends... is flavour. These noodle dishes could use some sodium.... honestly, I think the team should maybe reevaluate the flavour of their dishes. Presentation was nice, but it didn't have the flavour to back it up."}
{"text":"I've had 2 meals hear and both were on point.  Things I love about this place: close to downtown but has easy street parking, great vibe inside, good food, and offers extended hours with takeout.   The first time we had the SSAM, ramen, and crispy Thai Egg..  All were good but the SSAM was sooo good.  Delicious pork buns along with a section of tasty meats.   The Ramen was solid as well.  My second trip was a quick one for the chicken noodle.  Cold WI day with the chicken noodle made my night."}
{"text":"I was really excited about the prospect of this pan-Asian restaurant by Tory Miller. However, like his other restaurants, Graze and Etoile, it's a bit hit or miss. The wonderful items on the menu are fantastic: Jjamppong seafood noodles had an amazing broth and the refreshing frozen custard -- these were elevated to a high art. However, they also make the disappointing dishes just that much more disheartening: Congee tasted and looked like a lumpy oatmeal -- inedible, a plate of mostly breading with a touch of squid masquerading as \"salt and pepper squid.\" Also, the inexplicable: good fried chicken, but priced at $18? Make sure you read the reviews carefully and opt for the right items to get great meal while avoiding the bad."}
{"text":"Totally love the new menu! Had the Kalbijjim, a short rib beef stew, and it was the perfect thing for a cold night. Absolutely delicious and perfectly executed. The new pho is a more classic style than before and really satisfying. Finished things off with the door county cherry wonton and it was seriously one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. Ideal balance of tart and sweet with a killer burnt caramel crunch from the wonton. Big fan.   So pumped Sujeo is in the neighborhood! I think they're going to have lot of success with these new dishes."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here, I heard great things from a friend.  My boyfriend and I went one night, and it was rather busy. The wait was about 45 minutes, but the hostess said if there was room in the ramen bar, we could sit there. So we made our way to the far end of the restaurant, where you turn a corner and end up in a little mini restaurant- there were seats at the ramen bar, which were full, or tiny booths that fit one person on each side.  We chose one of the two empty booths (the one without dirty dishes on it).  The service was good. The ramen was okay.  I would eat it again if I was either drunk or hungover. I had tofu ramen, and it was super oily. My boyfriend got the pork belly ramen, and he didn't like it enough to leave half the bowl full (which he never does). Both of us had big globs of noodle-balls in our ramen- it seemed as though they perhaps froze/refrigerated the noodles beforehand and then just plopped them in the bowl before serving.   The worst part about our meal was the (presumably drunk) late 20's men that sat down in the booth next to ours. One kept yelling to his friends at the bar, asking if they got their food yet, because he already got his, even though he ordered after them, because he's \"VIP!! Hahahaha\"  Anyhow, I would go back and sit at the actual restaurant to see if that menu has any better options, but if you're looking for the best ramen in madison, stick to Umami."}
{"text":"Went to the official opening tonight with my wife. We arrived a little after 6 and we're told it'd be a half hour wait and they'd text us when our seats were ready. We sat at the bar and got a Yep in my White Tea and a Shipwrecked. The Shipwrecked was very good.  The coconut wasn't overwhelming with just a light lime taste. The White Tea was light and refreshing, but I was expecting a bigger flavor in a sangria.  After about 28 minutes a staff member walked up to us and let us know it might be about another 15 minutes before we were seated and told us he'd buy us a drink if it took longer then that. We were seated about 10 minuets after that. This was a good harbinger of what was to come. Throughout the meal we had excellent service, almost too many stops by the table to see how things were going.  The dining area was smaller and tighter then I would have guessed.  I didn't see the noodle bar area, so maybe there's more to it then the front dining area. There's some outdoor seating but it appears only for drinking, not eating.  We started off with the fried squid. It had a light coating and came with an chili mayo. The coating was simple and showed off the high quality of the squid. It had perfect texture and the mayo added a good kick.  The Kim and Kim hot sauce from the table was great on it as we'll.  I ordered the Jjamppong and my wife got BBQ Pan Fry Noodle. We switched our plates a couple times throughout the meal.  The Jjamppong had a good amount of seafood. The two scallops were prepared perfectly tender. The shrimp and muscles had nothing fancy done too them, and we're allowed to just show off their quality.  The spicy pork added a nice element to the dish as a contrast to the seafood.  This all sat atop a good sized pile of noodles in a spicy broth.  The broth had great flavor without relying too heavily on salt or heat. The noodles were excellent and were not just an after thought. The only down to the dish was the oysters were a little gritty.  The BBQ Noodle was scattered with a wonderful pork with a smokey flavor. The greens in the dish were cooked, but still firm, with a slightly bitter finish. Once again the noodles were great with a good sauce. The restaurant had a good theme of great flavors that don't over power or rely on too much sugar or sodium.  Our bill including 2 drinks, appetizer, 2 entrees, and tip was exactly $70. I will be back, soon. I debated on a 4 or 5 star review, but the food quality won me over."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night around 8:30 with my boyfriend and a friend. Overall, we had a fun time, and I would go back. Some pros and cons:  Pros: -Their banchan ( = assortment of Korean-style side dishes, mostly cold, pickled, and featuring hot pepper paste, kimchi being the most famous of the bunch) is a MUST. Lots of great flavors and textures. The pickled daikon was yummy. Plus, banchan really makes you feel like you're eating in a Korean restaurant, even if the other food you order isn't Korean in origin.  -The ddeokbokki (fish and rice cakes cooked in a spicy-sweet sauce; very typical Korean street food) is well done, plus the hard-boiled egg is a nice touch.  -The chili-braised eggplant is not overly spicy, and has good texture.   Cons: -There are two entrances, though one leads to the host's stand, and the other has you walking awkwardly through the restaurant...I vote lock the latter entrance and post a sign telling people where to go. NBD, but it's an off-putting first impression.  -Sujeo is overpriced. Not monstrously so, but it is. For example, the lechon kawali (fried pork belly with a cherry tomato-onion salad), while pretty tasty, is appetizer-sized and is $12!"}
{"text":"Food was great except that the fresh Sichuan peppers hijacked the Dan Dan for us making it difficult to eat. We highly recommend the Fried Brussels Sprouts and the Korean Fried Chicken Wings. The Red Sangria was tasty as well."}
{"text":"I have ventured in on day 1 of dim sum brunch.   Verdict: Love it, but still have room for improvement!  I was really grateful that Chef Tory Miller is active on fb and instagram, and so on a Saturday morning when I was lamenting the lack of new brunch places I wanna try, I SAW THE LIGHT! Chef Tory posted pictures of dumplings. What?! soup dumplings? So in less than an hour, my friends and I got to Sujeo, 5 minutes before opening.  Surprisingly, not so many people were aware of this delicious new treat, maybe only 4-5 tables were filled (compared to the usual full house at night). You can get the lunch menu, most of the dinner items were available, and there was congee! Whee. The highlight was of course off the menu - dim sum. They brought out tea right away, in a nice cast iron tea pot, LOVE IT (dim sum needs to be paired with tea)! On day 1 there were 10 items or so available, and the staff kindly tried to recapitulate olden days in Hong Kong, where fresh piping hot dim sum were brought out on carts (YAY). And indeed, the dim sum was fresh, only 2 or 3 servings were brought out per time, and they were gone before the round was finished (due to eager customers like ME!).  Disclaimer: I was born in HK, partially raised in HK, then in Singapore (also Asia and lots of dim sum options), so I have very particular tastes for dim sum.  Things must try: Lotus leaf rice - as the server told us, DO NOT EAT THE LEAF, it is like foil/parchment paper used to wrap the delicious hidden treasure - glutinous rice AND bacon! Whee. very very well flavored. I couldn't stop eating it. Taro ball - i'm not a fan of taro, but I'm a convert! The fried batter was very light and crispy, the taro was not pasty and was delicious mixed with some other meat. HIT! Kim chi bao - sounds weird i know. but Chef Tory doesn't disappoint on Asian Fusion dishes! The bao is fried top and bottom like the sheng jian bao (in some shanghainese/taiwanese cuisine) and the kimchi was mixed with meat (not too sour at all) Meatball - beef balls with orange skin and spring onions. Very very well done (inside was pink! Love it). Chewy meatballs, eaten with vinegar. woo. better than any I've had in Asia.  Maybe: BBQ pork bao - a hit with my friends but not so much with me. The bun was reasonable but for me the BBQ pork was too sweet. Turnip cake - nicely fried. But I had too much fried stuff Lumbia roll - it is an egg roll (just an indonesian term for it). Nicely done, but not wowing.  Needs some (quite alot) of work: Soup dumpling - too much skin (dense/thick), that I didn't taste the meat and soup. Need to make the skin thinner, AND put more soup and meat in it Har gau - no. no no. no. it was a mixed of chopped of shrimp with ginger and pepper. no. and the skin was again, needing more work. it broke easily, and was still rather thick. sorry, har gau is really a piece of work.  I'm so grateful for this new spot for dim sum! Finally. in Madison!!!! Definitely some things need work, but there's a lot which I would crave within a week or two to go back for brunch again.  Now, how about some tea cocktails to pair with dim sum? Hot drinks for winter! And, i really like salted egg yolk buns, siew mai, please?? ;)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was the service.   We odered several apps and a couple entrees all of which were wonderful.  We loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"This is a good Asian Fusion place. I've been to Sujeo twice, once for dinner and another time for lunch. Word of caution, the menu changes often so don't go in expecting something you've seen on yelp being on the menu cause it might not! I went with a group of 10 for dinner and we all ordered different dishes to try. Everything tasted fresh and very delicious. I have nothing bad to say about the food. The cocktail drinks however leaves a lot to be desired. Many of us left our drinks half finished and stuck to water.  Lunch at Sujeo was fast and food came out great. Will definitely go again.   I was quite surprised that they also list exactly where they got their local ingredients. Kuddos!"}
{"text":"Whereas Sujeo does seem from one vantage point to be \"Korean Fusion\" cuisine, it seems infinitely closer to \"Pan Asian\"; while some of their dishes do seem to be decisively \"Korean\" in nature (of course with some foreign elements), a lot of their other offerings don't seem \"Korean\" or contain any Korean elements at all.  Semantics aside, the above sentiment doesn't quite change the fact that Sujeo offers a new dimension to Madison's already growing and diverse restaurant game; a friend of mine who works at Epic and I decided to come here after having breakfast at Graze (whose owner, Tory Miller, also happens to be the brain child of Sujeo) and being so impressed by the food that we decided we need more.  Besides the fact that everything we ordered that evening did not requite the restaurant's namesake utensil (sujeo == spoon in Korean), the meal was pretty excellent:  Appetizer Salad (now replaced by Kohlrabi Salad) Very nice mix of heirloom tomatoes with other organic greens, with chicken innards mixed in, topped with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and other spices. I'm shocked that this is no longer on the menu.  Whole Fried Fish I forget what the fish was that evening, but it was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, garnished with tangy and somewhat spicy sauce all around the fish.   Khao Soi The first Khao Soi I've tried that come with an entire chicken drumstick, not removed from bone! The curry-broth was point on, the crispy noodles were brilliant.  The restaurant wasn't as mind-blowing as we hoped it to be, but it was still a solid choice -- oh, and the next person that keeps professing the hypothetical existence of \"Tonkatsu ramen\" (Tonkatsu == amalgamation of Japanese \"ton\" which means pig/pork and english \"cutlet\"; Tonkotsu == Ton [pig/pork] + Kotsu [bone]) needs to be hunted down by a lynch mob."}
{"text":"Best bimbimbop! It comes in an authentic stone bowl and has tons of flavor. Their Brussels sprouts are to die for and a must have. They have a great kombucha on their menu that was delicious and unique. The only complaint is hat I think they have a great food menu but their atmosphere doesn't necessarily match the food."}
{"text":"Like many others, I wanted to love Sujeo when I went for the first time. Even though I live in the neighborhood it took me until 2018 to get there. Needless to say, I was excited to try it!   When the hostess sat us she made a comment about putting us close to the kitchen where we would be warm. We were not warm. In fact, we were so cold we were waiting to ask to be moved right when our food came. At that point we decided to tough it out.   I had the bibimbap with beef, my husband had the bulgogi. Both were very good, but considering the price, not AMAZING.   Sujeo provides comment cards along with your receipt. I left a note saying that we liked our food and had good service but that where we were sitting was borderline freezing. Later that night I got an email from the manager at Sujeo saying thanks for the feedback and that their heating system was malfunctioning. Fair enough.   This is where it gets weird, folks. The manager then accused us of taking the signed receipt with us and asked if we would like to leave a tip.   Really?   We just wanted to tell you how uncomfortably cold we were during our meal, and now you're emailing me asking if we'd like to leave a tip when we already left more than 20%? It was bizarre. We promptly got another note saying to ignore the earlier message because they found the slip. In any case, it put a sour taste on what was already a somewhat lackluster experience. My search for the best Korean food in Madison continues...!"}
{"text":"The drinks were tasty and creative.  As for the food, it could've been better. From a scale of 1-5, here's how I would rate each dish. We ordered: Imperial Roll - 3 Egg Roll - 3 Dumplings - 3 Ssam (ribeye) - 3, the steak was flavorless Shio Ramen - 1, broth and ramen were too fishy Chili crab - 4 for the flavor of the sauce, 1 for the crab - not fresh, tasted some ammonia flavor Pork Tonkatsu - 3.5 (good but not for $22) Chai spiced tea custard -2.5 (not a big fan of chai)  I'm willing to try the curry noodle next time but I probably won't order any of these dishes the 2nd time."}
{"text":"This place deserves way more than 3 stars, but why the 5 stars you may ask? Because I couldn't find one thing about my experience there to complain about. The restaurant itself is trendy yet cozy and the service was excellent. You could really tell that the servers had actually tasted the food and knew how to explain things to you/what to recommend. They also frequently filled my friends tea cup for her which was noticed and appreciated.  Now onto the food. First, I started with their Tongue Thai'd drink. It was spicy and sweet and a whole lot of yummy. My friend and I then shared the Thai Egg Salad as an appetizer and devoured it. It was super fresh and flavorful. For my entrée I ordered the Khao Soi, and my friend ordered the Mango Curry. Both were delicious! The broth in the Khao Soi was incredible. It made everything in the bowl extremely tasty. My friend's dish was also amazing. Everyone was raving about it at our table. When I come back I will definitely have to make sure and order it.   We didn't stick around for soft serve, but I hope to have enough room in my stomach next time around to try it out. No complaints here, Tory Miller does it again."}
{"text":"Service was very good ... but menu choices?  Seriously, does everything have to have bacon or pork in it.  I am not a vegetarian, but don't eat pork and I'm not a fan of restaurants where I have only one or two menu items to choose from ... it certainly dissuades me from going back.  I imagine vegetarians will have similar concerns."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night by myself. I really want to come back to try some other dishes.  FOOD:I ordered a glass of sake and the Shio Ramen. I was really happy with it - noodles were nice and chewy. Perfect egg. Good broth - though could have a tiny bit more to it (this is the only time I've ever added hot sauce to anything). I couldn't place exactly what I felt was missing. But I would still get it again. Custard flavor: bourbon coconut. So delicious. Save room for dessert.  ENVIRONMENT: Clean, bright. Lots of tables for two, so perfect for someone dining alone. Outdoor seating too, but it was packed on such a nice summer night.  SERVICE: Seated right away - I'm sure this place could end up with a wait. My server was great. As a single diner, there's not a lot that can go wrong. But he was good about continuing to check that I didn't need anything and make sure everything was going well."}
{"text":"Sadly, this was not the experience my party had hoped for based on the recommendations of others for this restaurant. I went here last night with some friends. One of my friends has a peanut allergy, not severe previously, but still, she has it. While making the reservations, my friend repeatedly told the waitress she had this allergy. Upon arrival, she mentioned this again to our waiter TWICE. Eventually they brought out the food and after saying she had this allergy multiple times-- we figured it was safe to eat. It wasn't. The egg rolls ended up having peanut butter in them and had been fried in peanut oil. Bad night. Her reaction was the worst it has ever been and we ended up in Urgent Care shortly after leaving. Luckily, she was released and got to sleep in her own bed that night.   My advice for anyone wanting to eat here: the food is VERY GOOD but not at the price of a restaurant not being as cautious as possible towards an allergy."}
{"text":"Just visited for a late lunch over the weekend and I was so impressed! We dined family style. My party of three ordered two \"biggie\" dishes (smoked brisket fried rice, cheesy ddelkbokki), one \"smalls\" dish (fried Brussels sprouts) and one dish from the noodle section (japchae). We definitely had too much food, probably just enough for a party of four, but the leftovers were still so good!  Our Brussels sprouts came out first and they were literally bursting with flavor, best Brussels sprouts I have ever had! The remaining three dishes followed very soon after. I'd say after we made our decision it probably took ten minutes from ordering to having everything on the table. My favorite dish of the others was definitely the brisket fried rice. Both the japchae and ddelkbokki were very good as well. I loved the ddelkbokki but probably would not order it again unless I had a larger party because it was a lot of cheese to eat at once.  The atmosphere was hard to gauge as the tables are very spread out, but there was a nice surprise in the restroom in the form of a tile mural. Definitely check it out if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"I had a recommendation to try this place out and I'm glad we took it.  First of all, we were looking for a place that was having outdoor seating and dog friendly. This place met our needs for that exactly. The seating outside was in the shade around lunchtime and was great for what we were looking for.   The food was amazing! We had the cold noodle salad for an appetizer and were blown away with how good it was. Definitely would highly recommend getting it.   There was a special going for a burger that was absolutely amazing. It had a flamin' hot Cheeto coated onion and included with it some carmelized onions, local Wisconsin cheese included inside the burger, and some delicious sauce to top it off.  The side that came with the burger was some potato chips with some sweet honey sauce drizzled on top of them and let me tell you, it was perfect! I would definitely order it again if I were given the opportunity.   Check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Sujeo for quite some time. I was a little hesitant because the reviews are all over the place.   My mother and myself dined here for lunch. We split an order of the egg rolls. They were very different (very crunchy outside) They didn't really taste like an egg roll to me, but I did enjoy them.  I decided to try something unique off the menu - I couldn't decide between the Shio Ramen or the Khao Soi. The waiter highly recommended either. I decided to trying something different and new so I ordered the Shio Ramen. The waiter brought it out and the smell of it was repulsive. I tried to look past it and tried some of the broth. It was terrible. I didn't like it at all. I tried a few more bites and decided I couldn't even 'suck it up' and eat it - I knew I would be sick. I had my mother try it and she had the same reaction.  I had to send the meal back and tell the waiter I really did not care for it. They were able to make up the Khao Soi for me, which was MUCH tastier!  It was very spicy though.  I felt the menu needs to have some more details as to what is in the dishes and their spice level. When we were getting ready to leave there was another table that sent back the Kaho Soi because it was too spicy for them to eat.  The portions are very large, usually able to get a couple meals from a bowl of noodles. They are pricey - I'm not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"I give extra stars (and reviews) for places that have Sprite Zero -- it's the little things. This means I now have a mixer for Jinro soju. I'm also adding the noodle bar specifically to my \"Bomb Bar Seats\" list.  Bonus guide: How to make your burps taste delicious in 4 easy steps:   1) Order tonkatsu ramen.  2) Listen to your server and stir the crap out of your ramen bowl, otherwise it will start off not salty then become too salty.   3) Eat your tonkatsu ramen quickly to increase the chances of air bubbles forming.  4) Avoid eating anything else and enjoy delicious, smoky burps that will remind you about your flavorful lunch throughout the day.   Bonus tip: When you feel one coming, close your mouth and exhale through your nose to increase the flavor intensity."}
{"text":"I'm sad that I have to basically shit on Sujeo because there is definitely a place in the Madison restaurant market for a trendy/cool Asian restaurant. However this place just serves inferior versions of the real thing. If korean fried chicken really tasted like the way that they served it at Sujeo, there would be no point in koreans making fried chicken. The same goes for bibimbap, ramen, and dan dan noodles.   To be fair, they have two great dishes. The cheese curds with kimchi and the fried brussel sprouts and kale - unique and delicious. Unfortunately, the rest is just bullshit (I've had almost everything there because I kept going backing and trying new things hoping it would be better).   This restaurant only survives because it exists in Madison where it can get enough business from college kids who have probably only had Panda Express-level Chinese food. At best, Sujeo serves as a safe gateway to Asian cuisine wrapped up in a trendy package."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night - it was VERY busy so plan ahead and make a reservation if you want to come. We were lucky and got squeezed into their seats that faced the kitchen. I'm really glad we got those seat which I'll explain later.  For appetizers, we had fresh spring rolls and the chicken skin baos. The fresh rolls were good and pretty much on par with other places that have this dish. The chicken skin baos were interesting. This is a take on the pork belly bao but instead there's a fried pieces of chicken skin. It's a great idea but the execution was not there. The chicken skin did not have the same flavorful accent as a pork belly would to the bao. Additionally, the baos were drenched in the sauce - and while the sauce was tasty, it was too much.  For dinner, I had the Korean Fried Chicken and my wife had the Japchae. Wow, the fried chicken was very good. The breading and the LARGE pieces of chicken were delicious. It came with two legs and a breast. The legs were almost as large as the chicken legs you get at the State Fair. That being said, if you're not a fan of dark meat, you might want to ask for a swap for another chicken breast.  Now, we had an entire view of the kitchen and was able to observe all of the cooking. It was a great experience. However, because of this, we were able to see my wife's dish get cooked...and sit for 45 minutes. Yes, because from the time we ordered, it took 90 minutes to get our food. I get that it is busy - but you do not let food sit for 45 minutes. Consequently, the glass noodles were all stuck together and dried out by the time she got the food.  I had high hopes for this place and I believe it has potential. The prices are way too high because I can get the same caliber of food elsewhere for much cheaper. And the service was horrendous. I probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"With a party of 8, we truly ordered about half of the menu and shared everything. I don't think a single dish disappointed. The one that stuck out the most with me was the egg rolls. Filled with fresh, delicious vegetables and fried to perfection- do not pass up this traditional offering!"}
{"text":"Our second visit back to Sujeo. We had fond memories of this place and had liked the food. After this visit, we won't be back. We had 4 dishes. The first is their popular crispy chicken skin bao. 2 in a plate. This time, the skin was soaked in the spicy sauce. We all remember the first time we had it and the skin wasn't coated - just brown and crispy. Wait staff staff said it is always prepared like so. Didn't enjoy it as much. 2nd dish was the pastrami pho. Nice twist but the soup base was not impressive. Too bland and not the usual aromatic beef stock i am used to for pho. 3rd dish was KBC. I take that as Korean bbq or broasted chicken. Way too dry and spicy. Again chicken pieces were soaked in spicy sauce like the chicken skin. Every time i see food soaked in a sauce,  I can't help but wonder if the food is not fresh so they masked it by soaking them in spicy sauces. 4th dish was grilled short short ribs with rice. Comes with pickled radish and kimchi. Decent taste.   Overall less satisfied than our first visit. Hope your experience will be better."}
{"text":"How many ways are there to say...middling. If you're looking for an atmosphere that says 'World Market closeout', look no further! But surely the high sticker price food can save it...meh.   For the appetizer, my dining partner and I chose the Laab Spring Rolls. While they had decent flavor, the use of ground lamb made this dish texturally confusing and overall it just missed the mark. But for $8...I'm not upset.  I ordered a something Collins for a drink, overpriced, but tasty. So again, not upset.  For the entree, I'm a tad upset. I chose the Sujeo Ramen. #1 I missed the tamari egg of traditional ramen. If I want a soft boiled egg I...well...I don't want a soft boiled egg. #2 Absolutely flavorless noodles. Flavorless. And they picked up none of the decent, but stubtle broth flavor. The veggies were decent, but the true highlight was the pork. Perfectly tender and wonderfully seasoned...now if only some of that seasoning made it to the noodles that comprise the majority of the dish. . .  This was originally a 2 star review, but the pork saved it (that'll do pig, that'll do)...and watching the host (eventually) successfully grab a piece of garnish twig across the table with chopsticks. Dinner and a show.  Would I come back? Probably not.  Would I come back for ramen? Absolutely not. If I came back, would I repeat any of my order? Maybe the drink.  Conclusion, there is soooo much better in Madison, especially at that price point.  P.S. The KimKim Sauce comes back to haunt you. Moderation...even if you're trying to flavorize the flavorless noodles."}
{"text":"We tried Sujeo for lunch this past weekend. When we arrived all the window seats appeared to be taken. The hostess ushered us down the interior wall of tables and we were a little disappointed. It was dark and we wanted to enjoy the unusually warm and sunny winter day, but then she took us around the corner to the light, airy, and warm kitchen counter area. Big bright windows, and you can see the chefs in the kitchen making your meal. Fun!  We ordered bibimbap, pastrami pho, and thai iced tea. I was pretty disappointed with the thai iced tea. I usually have this when I eat at Vietnamese or Thai restaurants. At $5 each it seemed a little pricey but I was hopeful. The portion size was fine, but the tea seemed a little chalky and it reminded me more of a chai tea than what I'm used to. I did appreciate the bottle of water our waitress left at our table so we could help ourselves when we ran low on water.  While the tea was disappointing, the bibimbap was outstanding. As usual it was served in a hot stone bowl. But this time, there was a delicious crust on the rice where it cooked against the stone bowl. The egg on top seemed completely raw, but as it mixed with the ingredients in the piping hot bowl, it cooked and added wonderful texture and flavor to the dish. This is the first time we really understood why bibimbap is served in a hot stone bowl. A wonderful dish!  The pho, which is one of my favorite dishes in general, was a mixed bag. It came with the typical sides of bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos, basil and chili oil. Although there were plenty of jalapenos, I was hoping for more sprouts. The pho itself came in just a slightly smaller bowl and thus smaller potion than I hoped for. However, it was chock full of rice noodles, meatballs, tripe, tendon, and a few slices of pastrami. I'd never had pastrami in my pho before, it dealt an interesting flavor although I prefer the texture of the usual thin sliced sirloin. Turns out I was not disappointed that there wasn't more of it. What I did love were the meatballs. Those were the best little bites of heaven I've had in any pho! The tripe and the tendon which I don't usually love, were the perfect texture with incredible flavor. I savored each little bit as I found them. The broth which is usually the main component of pho was neither plentiful nor particularly to my liking. It reminded me of 5 spice powder but more metallic. I missed the beefy marrow flavor I usually associate with pho. I was really conflicted by this dish. Parts of it were outstanding and some of the best I've ever had and other parts just left me disappointed.   Conflicted sums up my experience at Sujeo. There was a truly memorable and outstanding dish, and complete miss, and the pho had elements of both."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with some friends. The menu is definitely eclectic. I had a 'Black Manhattan' for a cocktail which was pretty decent and the General Tso's Chicken Livers just because it seemed like something I'd never see somewhere else.   The flavor was good and the textures weren't an issue for me because I enjoy sweetbreads generally. I'm not sure I'd order it again though because it didn't transcend the General Tso's we are all so familiar with from every takeout place ever.   But the atmosphere was good and the chef seems daring. I'll go again."}
{"text":"There's a new menu from the time we last visited Sujeo. Even though I missed the old hotpot, I won't complain about the new menu. I could see what the owners were trying to achieve here. For a cheaper price, there was more variety to try. Loved the short ribs bulgogi. I hope it stays on the menu forever and they won't change this. We tried 2 different noddle dishes. The kimchi veg ramen and the Shio Ramen. The Shio Ramen had a very rich broth. The pork belly was extremely tender and juicy. The kimchi Ramen was spicy and brought back the Korean touch. We also had spare ribs with black beans. It was juicy, tender and a unique sauce (actually the sauce was the best- specially when we dunked white rice on it)  We were served by Sean. He was very courteous, attentive and gave excellent recommendations. Usually when we eat at a restaurant, the server makes or breaks my rating. I only give a 5 star when we get a combination of good food and service. Sean did an excellent job. We would sure go back again and try the rest of the menu before they change it again.   Must try to anyone who wants local, fresh and well thought out food with excellent service and ambience.   Double"}
{"text":"Sujeo could be considered 2 restaurants, in a way.  There is the formal dining room / bar (didn't eat there, due to being too hungry for the 1.75 hr wait) and the 'noodle bar' which is first come-first serve and you just stand at the door to the room, watching for the next booth (2 person booths) or barseat to open up.  Casual and friendly, we didn't feel awkward or 'in the way' as long as we stood against the wall.  Our wait was no more than 10 min for a booth.    We were greeted promptly by our friendly server.  Drinks (1. Yup On My White Skis and 2. weekly special cocktail with thai basil infusion) arrived promptly and had complex flavors, though a little sweet .  Food was very good and I liked that my raman noodles were wheat (house-made?), soft boiled egg and something in the menu had bone broth (the pho?) - this is an indicator of quality and nutrition, to me.    My husband got a seafood dish with housemade noodles, which was also good and had a decent ratio and variety of seafood.    Service: A bit scrambled, because a busy saturday pm about 7:00.  A bit pricey, considering at other local places where you can get pho and other Asian soup and noodle dishes, you get about a qt size bowl of food for $8- $10, which is made with exotic Asian meats such as tendon, fish balls, etc and is likely also made with bonebroth because isn't that 'just the standard way it's done' in UnAmericanized Asian restaurants? (like the ones where if you ask about an unfamiliar food displayed in the glass case being used as a standard cooler,  they say \"oooh, very good fish.  No know how say in English, but in Korean, it's %$@&*...very good, you try\" ) .   The main difference we liked between the UnAmericanized places and Sujeo is that our server was obviously 'invested' into her job and more than capable of guiding us through a menu with some unfamiliar foods and she was tipped well for it.    It just seems like maybe they took the same (loosely used with respect of individual skill, creativity to Sujeo's kitchen) food as the UnAmericanized places, changed for wheat noodles, cut portions in 1/3, added fancy cocktails and presented it with upscale interior design/furnishings, then jacked the price.  While I understand Sujeo probably pays top dollar for their spot on E.Wash in the fancy new bldg with designer bathroom tiles, is cleaner than many competitors, etc, I'm not a young urban professional with money to burn and will probably be back to try a few more items, but doubt I will come back for repeats of the same dish.    Note : bathrooms are single occupancy, with one can.   Most of the time we were there, there was a 1-2 person line about 3 min long - really not bad.   Still, maybe they would consider unisex bathrooms, since men's sat empty for about 3mins while I waited for women's?  Dane Co Credit Union westside went unisex and a guy waiting in line at Sujeo said he'd embrace the idea."}
{"text":"Expectations for Sujeo were extremely high due to Chef Tory Miller's success at L'Etoile and Graze.  With all of the hype and mixed reviews surrounding the new restaurant, I was eager to give it a try.   I went with a large group and the general consensus was that it's a good restaurant. Nothing more, nothing less. I ordered the Mango Curry and I loved it, as did everyone else that tried the dish. It had fresh veggies, decent sized shrimp, and mango chunks, with a side of sticky white rice. The curry sauce was the best part. It was creamy and very rich, which made the dish quickly satisfying. I would suggest this dish to anyone.   No one else was impressed with their food as I was with my dish.  As far as the noodle/ramen style dishes, Sujeo is definitely outdone by Umami over on Willy Street. The menu has a couple of all-star dishes (like the Mango Curry dish I ordered, and the Hot Pot), and the rest are average. But when it comes down to it, the menu is reasonably priced. If it was any more expensive, my group would have felt more disappointment at the end of the meal. But it's good food for what I think is relatively cheap.   I would definitely come back for drinks here. They have some unique cocktail options. My friend ordered the Tongue Thai'd, that used chili infused tequila, giving it a bite of spiciness, which I love. They have a ton of other interesting drinks that combine the craft cocktail trend with the asian fusion theme of the restaurant.   The service at Sujeo was outstanding. We were regularly checked-in on. I had ordered the mint herbal tea, and a waiter was always refilling my glass for me. They shared their advice and their favorites about the menu in a genuine way that didn't seem rehearsed.   The atmosphere was trendy and cool with it's modern design and bright walls. The dimmed lights made it an intimate setting and for that reason I think it would be a great place for date."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I was extremely excited to try it as I recently hopped on the ramen bandwagon.  Starting first for the appetizer, this was phenomenal.. up until the end. I can't remember the name and I don't see it on the menu anymore, it was some kind of tempura vegetable platter with rice and sweet chili sauce. I think it was the sauce that made this so great, but it became overly rich and salty after eating half the dish and I immediately regretted eating so much of it. I ordered the veggie ramen for my main meal and wasn't impressed. All I tasted was spicy and then just bland. I tried to doctor up the leftovers a bit the next day but it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say I was not as impressed as I thought I should have been since I decided to try this place based on the write-up in the June 2016 issue of Food & Wine magazine.    We arrived on Saturday around 2:30 PM, so, granted, they were close to closing time before they open later in the day for dinner. My husband order the Korean Broasted Chicken (KBC) and I ordered the grilled shrimp noodle salad.  We also ordered the house special (alcohol) punch for me and a beer for my husband (at $6 for the specialty domestic beer, that seemed pretty steep).  I liked the punch, which was also $6.  The KBC was good.  My husband loved the soy sauce it was served with and the BBQ sauce as well.  The chicken was tender and moist.  A generous portion for lunch - a piece of both white and dark meat.  But, the chicken was served on a bed of old-looking lettuce - kind of a misstep for the kitchen to detract from an otherwise good dish. I would suggest something like finely sliced Napa cabbage - anything that might add a bit of crunch and would be worth eating.  A good dish but, again, I would have expected more flair.  My grilled shrimp noodle salad was sadly lacking.  The shrimp were small, cooked to the point of dryness.  At least they were not rubbery. Seasoning was okay but more pan-grilled than grilled.  The noodles were not impressive and the broth lacked good flavor.  The dish certainly was not cohesive - it was noodles in tangy broth topped with 3 shrimp.  It did not live up to my expectations.  Service was good and helpful.  I think this place could do a lot better. And, given the fact that our waitress said they had been written up several times in food magazines I think Sujeo should strive to deliver their customer's a better experience - solid flavor and presentation and not just interesting Korean fusion."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive service but their overpriced Korean fare (bibimbab n chicken, both $18) was off, specifically their sauces which were too sour n acidic instead being slightly nutty from sesame oil. Strangely, the bibimbap - which should be dolsot bibimbap (\"stone pot\") - excluded some of the essentials veggies like bean sprouts, fernbraken, and carrots, but was replaced with mostly julienned radish. As a consolation though, I got to see my gf inhale the Khao Soi ($13?), so that alone is worth a recommendation for their non-Korean dishes."}
{"text":"Super good, although I've never had Korean food before so I don't have much to compare it to.  I had noodles and chicken in red coconut broth and it was awesome but sort of messy and splashy, especially when I was trying to eat the chicken leg with chopsticks. My Diet Coke was also extra cold and still in the can, which is how winners like me drink it."}
{"text":"Favorite dish #1: You can't beat the dumplings here. At least not in Madison. You get a plate of 5, so you'll have to argue over who gets the last one. It's a juicy mix of pork and shrimp wrapped in homemade (I'm assuming) dough, which is then pan fried to plump, crispy, dumpling-y perfection. (Yes, I just said plump.)  Favorite dish #2: The bibimbap is a personal favorite. Though beware--the hot stone bowl turns the rice and veggies into a molten hot mixture. If you're not careful it's easy to burn yourself. But the heat doesn't turn me away from the crispy rice, veggies, spicy kimchi and caramelized meat. Nom.  Favorite dish #3 (but is actually #1): The fried chicken!!! (KBC on the menu.) OHmygosh. It's soo good! Perfectly crispy outside, super moist inside. Huge pieces of chicken! I have no other words.   Others: The man has been working his way around the noodle dishes, and has enjoyed what he's experienced. Khao Soi (curry dish), pho, ramen are all good. We have our favorite places to go for pho and ramen, but Sujeo does the trick to satisfy immediate cravings. The chicken skin bao are also good. They're savory and fluffy.   The menu items change. I wish I could try them all... If only there was time and money. If not the food, the bumping beats will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"This is Korean/Japanese inspired American food.  Some people, even my white American friends, are critical of Sujeo not being authentic, but the chef isn't trying to be authentic.  As a Korean myself, I try to think of Sujeo as an American restaurant with a lot of Korean inspiration.   Since I'm a vegetarian I subbed the meat in japchae for tofu which was great. I liked that there were a lot of vegetables in it.  I also liked the eggplant appetizer. I haven't tried any ramen dishes my friends usually eat as I'm a vegetarian but no one I've gone with has ever really enjoyed the ramen at Sujeo's, stating it was \"not bad\" leading them to eat my food.   I hardly drink but I like the big pineapple cocktail. It's fun and worth trying once.   The ice cream flavors are pretty underwhelming. I'd rather get a McDonald cone than pay $ for subtlety flavored cheap soft serve....   The prices are expensive, the most expensive 'Korean' food I've ever seen along with K Peppers. But with Sol's on the Square's original owners leaving, unfortunately there's no good Korean food in Madison. And most non-American restaurants downtown need to pay real estate bills.  For authentic Korean expensive food with small portions, go to K Peppers. For Korean-inspired expensive food with larger portions, go to Sujeo.   The interior is very nice; not too fancy, not too casual, and very clean. I love the windows for natural light.  I've never seen this place more than 1/4 full so I wonder how their business is"}
{"text":"Tried the place for first time.  We were seated and ordered apps and dinner entrees.  The apps arrived and were delicious.  Then we waited for one hour without anyone checking on us or receiving any food. We had to get someone's attention and then finally the manager arrived and apologized.  Not only did we not get our food, the table next to us had to send there entree back because it was wrong.  Such potential but badly executed.  Expect to wait with no good service."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. The somewhat lukewarm reviews had me hesitant to try this place, but I was finally talked into it and I have to say I'm very glad that I came here.  We came in for lunch one snowy day. The restaurant was fairly empty which was a bit unfortunate because I think the atmosphere is such that the place would have a really cool feel to it if it was a bit more crowded. Our waiter was attentive and helpful.  We ordered the Veggie Ramen and the Bibimbap. The big revelation of our meal was the Veggie Ramen. The broth was spicy with a touch of sweetness in the flavor, which I loved. There were nice, fairly thick noodles and a great variety of vegetables - mushrooms, bok choy, radish. It also had a really good ramen egg. This is definitely a dish that I would crave and would be happy to eat on a chilly day or if I had a bit of a cold. The Bibimbbap was more of a standard stone bowl dish. I liked the crispy rice a lot in this dish but overall it was a lot like other Dolsot Bibimbaps I've had before. Overall, we found the food filling enough that we had leftovers that took care of both of us for another meal."}
{"text":"I really wish Sujeo would be my new favorite place to dine out in Madison but it isn't. Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes, but I was really underwhelmed by the food here. We came on a Sunday night and luckily there was no line. It was really cramped in here and you can hear all your neighbor's conversations. The service was excellent though.   The price was steep for Asian food. First of all, they charge $5 for \"gourmet\" loose leaf tea from Taiwan, which is kind of ridiculous for a pot of tea. Bf enjoyed his Shio ramen, but my veggie ramen was flavorless. Sure, the broth was spicy, but it lacks flavor. We also shared the salt and pepper calamari. There really wasn't any Asian inspiration to this dish. It would've been so much better if this is a Korean spicy squid dish. I think I might give this place another try, but definitely won't order the vegetable ramen again."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how tasty and robust the ramen is here. I tried the calamari when I was there, and it was crispy and flavorful, and they used the tentacles- not something every place uses. I definitely recommend the weekends with the dim sum carts rolling around."}
{"text":"Went back with family and had an okay time.   My Shio Ramen was disgusting, though. It tasted really...fishy. And salty. I couldn't stand the taste and handed it around the table for others to try. Not one person at a table of six liked it. I didn't finish it and decided to leave it at the table. Not even worth taking home. I did eat the pork belly but everything else stayed in the bowl. Blegh.  One of us ordered Mango Curry and said it was fine, but mentioned he's had better. The chicken livers were good, but didn't taste as good as the first time I ate here. The Khao Soi seemed to be the most successful dish of the night, and the Thai-Style Fried Rice was deemed too salty, but otherwise fine. I believe Bún Ch was also ordered, and he seemed to like it.  Service was a disaster, though. Two people arrived, and it wasn't clear who was training whom. The dirty looking bearded fella made about as many mistakes as possible. This particular server seemed out of place and quite incapable.   The potstickers were pretty good.  We were one of the first tables to be seated, as we arrived for an early dinner. So it makes all of the issues we had all the more perplexing. A couple of our friends were dining nearby and they also commented on not being entirely happy.  I'd like to check out their lunch offerings sometime and perhaps brunch. I'll remain optimistic and try some of their other dishes in hopes of something much better than that awful bowl of Shio Ramen."}
{"text":"Well, it's a good thing the bartenders were excellent and on-it, because you ain't likely to see a real table. Long wait for a table and weird waiting set-up (see below) but we had a great time at the bar. Unique, tasty cocktails, and the bar menu had enough options to keep us happy. We shared the kolrabi salad & pot stickers - both were delicious (though it's downright cruel to have an app of 5 pot stickers for 2 people. We almost came to blows over that 5th one...The Boyfriend had the ramen for dinner and I had the Bun - which was packed with fresh, flavorful, ingredients. We will definitely go back.   Note re waiting for a table: We arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night - at the start of a snowstorm - and were told it would be a 75 minute wait. We said we'd wait at the bar and still the host asked for a phone number to text us when the table was ready. We said, 'We're gonna be sitting right there [like 5 feet away] at the bar. How about you just tell us when the table's ready? [So we don't have to have our phones out and distractingly on during our date]' We were told that wasn't doable. So we gave a phone # and waited and waited for a table...weird and kind of annoying, but time at the bar was well-spent. $81 including tip for 2 apps, 3 cocktails, and two entrees."}
{"text":"As for Pan-Asian fare overall coming from San Diego, now living in St Louis and on this occasion, Madison, WI, Tory Miller lands a win in my book with my now 2nd of 4 of his restaurants in Madison as part of the Deja Food group this and his other 3 venues are part of (Estrellon, Graze, L'Etoile) I have been to Estrellon and loved it so had high bar set for this visit with my aunt and uncle who also made their debut with me here.  Noon on a frigid Saturday afternoon, 3 of like 10 people in the place max. We sat in the kitchen bar area all to ourselves. Got to see the magic happen right in front of us.   My sampled items were amazing. Japachea was great! Sweet potato noodle debut and I like! Not super sweet or overly salty, just right. Marinated tender steak, stir fried peppers and onions.   Pork steam buns were melt in your mouth pockets of deliciousness. Soft, flavorful and packed with tender seasoned pork meat.  Laab spring roll was a nice spin on a basic shrimp or veggie spring roll packed with minded lamb meat and the usual fixings. This roll is big! The sauce is great as well!  My aunt got the red curry and my uncle got the veggie pho bowl, both seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. Portions are big as we all came home with leftovers!   Wish like heck I could have caught chef Miller in the mix of things. Want to meet this guy as he pioneers a whole new movement of food and culinary revamping in Madtown!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I had high hopes for this place, and I was pretty disappointed.  It might have been fine if we hadn't gone with the hot pot.  For one thing, the burner is enormous on the tiny cafe tables, and they brought it to us before we had our drinks or appetizers, so our server had to struggle to fit in all of the plates, glasses, banchan dishes, and anything else we had on our table.  We really couldn't see each other or talk very easily over the hot pot and the noise (I have no idea how it was so noisy, it was not that busy in there).  When we asked if they could take the hot pot burner away and bring it back after we had our appetizers, they said no.  Okay, fine, we should have ordered something else after we saw we were sitting at the small tables.  But even the contents of the hot pot were disappointing, as 90% of it was full of cabbage and green onion stalks, and the dumplings in the soup were mushy and extremely sub par.  Even the simple bowl of white rice that came with it was total mush (way past \"sticky\"), so we didn't eat that, and the broth was pretty mediocre and salty.  That said, the banchan was fine, similar to what I've had everywhere else, and we had the beef tongue and tripe appetizer, which I didn't have any problems with, but it suffered from being compared to the one at Fugu, which is amazing.  Service was polite, the experience was okay, but I left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.  I'll probably give it one more try."}
{"text":"I found it to be over-priced, so, the value just wasn't there.  I couldn't decide between 2 or 3 stars.  I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.  The place seemed very clean though,  which is always a plus in my book.  Also, if you like ramen soups, it's worth a try, since, there was a large selection of them.  The location doesn't warrant the prices in my opinion, but, if you're in the area and like ramen soups, then, give it a try."}
{"text":"Was not super impressed by the ramen. It was okay, but not flavorful enough. Also sitting at the noodle bar sound like a cool/fun idea, but it's just ridiculously hot. Maybe it'll be better for the winter..."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Madison a couple months ago. We have both been so busy and have been eating out every other day... Sujeo has the worst food we have had in Madison. Definitely not worth the money.  The smoke brisket fried rice was way too smokey and oily. Potstickers were a miss as well, we each had one piece and tossed the rest. I would have rather eaten a cup of noodles or store bought bag of ramen over their Dan Dan Noodles. The big egg roll was OKAY. We will not be returning to Sujeo."}
{"text":"This was my husband and my time trying Korean food, but based on this restaurant we are big fans! He had the Bibimbap, and I had the Dan Dan noodles. Everything was delicious! My husband enjoyed the crispiness of the rice and the stone bowl, and I really loved the spiciness and the cilantro in my dish. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Most of the pictures are not on the menu,  saw some things I wanted to try and was not able to order any of it.  The service was great and everyone was nice.  We shared the egg roll which was huge.  It was meant to share.  It had good taste and it reminded me a lot of a spring roll in an egg roll.     The bibimbap was alright, nothing to rave about, but also nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"1 Star for Pho ordered. 5 star for the good friendly service.  ordered Pho bowl other day. $12. thought it was going to be higher end version i was wrong.  taste like boiled beef bones and noodles. the noodles came out hard not cooked. it was hard to eat. No sarachi sauce on table nor anything else like pepper or salt like you see at other restuarants.  missing alot of the authentic ingredients definitly does not taste like real pho.  i will be back to try the chili crab.    anytime you involve noodles you got to have the condiments to accomodate noodles no questions asked. i will not be ordering pho here again but going to try some other dishes.."}
{"text":"Have been here three times and my experience on the food is getting worse each time. If you would like to get real Chinese, Korean or Thai food, try somewhere else. Most of the food are very oily and people who cook it really dont know how to get a balance among spices. The restaurant itself is very small and some tables are too close to each other. Service is OK, but not impressive. Parking lot is full of kitchen smell. Really tried to give this restaurant a chance as its close to where I live, but im giving up now."}
{"text":"We ordered the dim sum brunch and tried out the array of soju.    Dim sum -- We enjoyed everything we ordered.  They did not have the cart service, and based on other reviews I've read of the place it seems like they don't often have it, so I'm not sure why it's even offered.  It seems like it would make more sense to order it from the paper.  Soju tasting -- Interesting if you've never had soju but after trying it I wouldn't order it again or recommend it.  It came with a cup of regular soju, and then three that were infused - strawberry, mango curry, and some sort of herbal/spiced one.  The mango curry was surprisingly good.  But the herbal/spiced one tasted like you were drinking a melted down crandberry-spiced holiday candle, or a bowl of potpourri.  Terrible.  I would recommend sticking with the traditional soju.  Overall -- Great service, nice interior, and interesting dishes on the menu.  However, if I were in the mood for anything traditional (and not the creative, fusion dishes they also offer, or noodle dishes), I'll stick with my regular Korean spot.  This place is very pricey and I highly doubt the quality is worth the money when you can get that sort of thing elsewhere in town.  But I'll definitely go back for the dim sum, and maybe try the noodles."}
{"text":"For starters, the egg rolls were amazing. Probably the best egg roll I've had; tempura-like shell and yummy veggies and stuff inside. Main course, the Korean veggie ramen was delicious. The perfect amount of spicy. Presentation was beautiful. Atmosphere was alright. We had an early dinner so the restaurant wasn't filling up until about when we were leaving. We realized there was a back area where you can watch the cooks, which looked fun but we had no idea it existed. Would go back, but would ask to sit in back."}
{"text":"This place has a lot to improve on.. Ordered a bottle of Pinot noir wine.. And they brought a decanter with something red. Food was either too salty or too spicy.. I mean too too spicy. Our usher had no idea what is in the dish and asked to to find out from the sever. So overall a 2"}
{"text":"We ordered Japche something (sweet potato noodle and marinated beef) and Sishuan spice Spare ribs. It was extremely salty and oily. The flavored were good but too salty. We couldn't finish our dishes. I actually wanted to send it back in the kitchen but we've never done that before so we just went with it. It was horrible with the price we had to pay and the taste. We ate nothing after all. Absolutely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the banchan (7 different kinds of pickles with flavorful kimchi jjigae soup). Both the pickles and the soup were top notch. I'm a pickle fanatic and have had a hard time finding quality asian pickles in Madison. These were A++ pickles! Only odd thing was the inclusion of the macaroni salad.  Ddeokbokki was super fresh tasting, rice cake was chewy/delicious (it is harder than you would think to find a good rice noodle) and the fish cake was slightly sweet in a well spiced sauce.  Chili-braised eggplant was interesting, in a light chili sauce with basil, very innovative.  Mango curry was thick, not traditional Thai-tasting, did not appear to have a large amount of coconut milk. The highlight of the curry was the mango, which cut through the other spices in a bright, pleasant way. There were also these curious, thin, crunchy unknown vegetables, and squash. I had hedged on ordering it because Madison does not lack for good Thai restaurants, but I am pleased, because it was great and set itself apart from its contemporaries.  We ended the meal with chocolate and strawberry custard, the milk is from Sassy Cow. The custard had nice flavor (as in, it tasted like strawberries and not artificial) and had a slightly grainy texture.   I am already planning out my meal for next visit, which might be this week. I have found my favorite restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"I will begin by saying that I intend to amend this review in the future. But for now, one star is adequate. I will also preface this by saying that I cook at a country club full-time, am attending Le Cordon Bleu, and I lived in Korea for 2 years. This is not coming from spite or anything but an honest food review.  It actually hurts me to give a bad review because it seems like they are trying to do a good job but honestly, $45 for a super stringy and fatty and BLAND  NY strip steak with some lettuce and steamed buns? I didn't mind that it was rare. I prefer my meat rare. It just did not taste like anything. At all. The banchan were okay but still lacked punch and imagination. I know this isn't Korea but other Korean restaurants include a bunch of bottomless banchan for free! But that isn't my problem. I will pay for great food and I expected to do so here. It just did not live up to what I expected. I thought it would be flavorful and authentic and it was none of those things. It also didn't seem to succeed at being fusion - bland is not fusion, it is just bland. I am sorry Tory!   If you want to do Korean, then do it, but make sure you season the dishes correctly! Honestly it was so underwhelming that I am glad we ordered 2 bottles of soju...  Looking forward to going back and NOT ordering the ssam. Hoping something on the regular menu will be better. Will edit next time."}
{"text":"As much flavor and life as a frozen PF Chang meal. Might as well just get one of those and save your money. At least then you know the level of mediocre you're getting and spend proportionally.  The Shio Ramen has the blandest broth I've ever had accompanying ramen. A mildly fishy water with noodles, some mediocre pork belly and an egg. No body, no depth.  The KBC might as well be called KFC with rice and ketchup. Oh and bland kimchi too.  The Dan Dan is basically spaghetti with generic \"Asian\" spices. Ragu with chili and sesame oil anyone? The BBQ Pan Fry Noodle might have been worth it if half the meat hadn't been grisly and inedible.  Sujeo is a step up if your baseline is Americanized stripmall Chinese. Otherwise it's basic and boring and tries so hard to be as flavorlessly Asian as possible so as not to offend anyone's tastebuds that it's actively infuriating."}
{"text":"Went with some friends last week and I ordered the drunken noodles - They come spicy and they did not disappoint.  Probably the best Drunken Noodles I have ever had.  To me Drunken Noodles or Pad Thai are two staples to easily judge a venue - Do they make it special & is it worth trying other things?,... In this case it was an Easy - \"Lets come Back!\"  Someone had recommended the Brussels Sprouts with Kale appetizer - everything was chopped up and tasty.   One friend ordered the Ramen and was not over the moon with it - but it was worth taking it home and adding her own touch.  She said it was still a win for her and next time she would just order something different :)   This Tory Miller restaurant did not disappoint!  (Tory Miller recently bested Bobby Flay on an Iron Chef gauntlet show)."}
{"text":"How do you rate an inconsistent restaurant? I have to give a:  - 5 to the fried chicken (KBC): expensive but can feed at least two people. It is 2 legs and 2 bone-in, breast pieces. Plus Banchan (7 types of pickles) and white rice. I shared it with 2 friends and could have stopped eating after that.  - 4 to the general tso chicken livers and thighs. I really liked it. It is a huge plate of fried meat, so not the lightest, brightest dish you can imagine, but it is perfectly crispy and the sauce had a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The one thing I would do different is to cut the sweet breads smaller: as they are they are quite a mouthful  - 2 to the eggplant and tofu: limp, too sweet and undercooked (but might have been an unlucky batch I ordered them because I heard good things from some other friend)  - 2 to the soju flight: I really didn't care for any: chrisantemum was sweet, chili pepper was flavorless and liquorice one was way too medicinal, the plain soju was really not good soju  My friends had the bibimap and the ramen and they both complained. Apparently,  bibimap was too dense and ramen bland. I did not try them, so cannot elaborate further, but they seemed really disappointed.  I am inclined to be generous, because two of my dishes were good and I would definitely go back to have them, but   Oh, service was strange: server didn't seem to understand what we wanted, brought out dishes in the wrong sequence and he pretty much refused to give us a recommendation despite our insistence."}
{"text":"The KBC and bibimbap were the perfect amount of crispy, and I will be making the tomato banchan at home."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is not good at all.  We have ordered several dishes but only one veggie noodle dish and the spare ribs were eatable.  Chicken skin nap is so salty, too much BBQ sauce.  Pho noodle is over cooked, the lamb dish the the worst over all, can't even put it in your mouth, way toooooooooo salty, how can a restaurant serve this kind of food, it's gross.  I do not come back for sure"}
{"text":"My wife and I had stumbled across this establishment as a happy accident one evening.  And, let me tell you, we were not disappointed.  I had heard of Sujeo, but had no idea of the location or the menu.  One evening, we found ourselves in the neighborhood and decided to try it out.  The dining area was packed, as it should on a Saturday night.  We were lucky enough to get a spot at a small table in the noodle bar.  We were seated and immediately taken aback by the decoration and an unobstructed view into the kitchen.  I've often wondered what it is like from the perspective of the cooks when the guests can see them at work.  Rather, in the case of Sujeo, there is seating right at the counter offering close-up views of the different stations.  Do the cooks feel like this transforms them into performance artists, or do they rather feel they are gawked at as if at a zoo?  I am inclined to lean toward the latter.  Our waitress was extremely kind, greeting us with a smile and explaining the menu.  My wife has a bit more exposure to Korean cuisine and she was particularly interested in the Short Rib Bulgogi.  My attention is instantly drawn to anything smoked, so I went for the Smoked Brisket Fried Rice.  Of course, we had to start out with the Pork & Shrimp Potstickers, opting for the pan-fried variety.   I cannot give the food enough praise.  The Potstickers were a delightful combination of succulent and crispy.  I wanted to drink the sauce that came on the side.  The Bulgogi was tender and flavorful.  You wrap the short rib in a lettuce leaf and top with kimchi and ssamjang at your discretion... this is something I need more of in my life.  The Smoked Brisket Fried Rice blew my mind.  The brisket was smoky, salty and tender, with the beef fat literally melting in my mouth.  Pairing this intense flavor with fried rice is genius.  The only \"problem\" was the intense richness of the dish.  I found myself draining a few beers while eating, which is not necessarily a bad thing.    Overall, this place is amazing.  If you are wanting to try something new and different but not overtly intimidating, this is your best bet.  I cannot wait to go back for other dishes on the menu that piqued my interest... looking at you, Bibimbap and Shio Ramen.  Looking forward to trying some Soju and hopefully getting a front-row seat to watch the kitchen in symphony."}
{"text":"A great restaurant needs to have both amazing food and terrific service. The food at Sujeo has been consistently wonderful. Unfortunately, the service has been inconsistent on our visits, and today's was downright unacceptable.  We came here to have brunch for Mother's Day.  Our reservations were for 12:30, and we walked in right on time. The restaurant was less than half full, which surprised us for both graduation and Mother's Day weekend. The host came over and took drink orders.  He was a bit of a low talker, and I actually thought he asked how we were doing.  The server (Luna) came over after a bit, and asked if we'd like to start with anything.  We ordered the brussel sprouts and an order of the fried rice.    While we received the brussels sprouts fairly quickly, we did not get the fried rice until more than a half hour later, which seemed later than what it should have been.  I was surprised we even got the fried rice - at this point, we all assumed Luna had forgotten it. More than an hour after we were seated, our mains finally  arrived and they were delicious.  We had the rockfish, japchae, miso ramen, and bibimbap.  There was confusion about who was going to bring the check to us (server vs host), which seemed pretty indicative of the service issues we encountered.  Overall, we were disappointed in our time there. Until the service at Sujeo improves, I can't see us returning for some time.  This is unfortunate, because we love the food so much."}
{"text":"Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com  Sujeo is Tori Miller's newest enterprise after the success of L'Etoile and Graze. He is letting his Asian pride fly in his newest venture.  Graze has long had some Korean flavor throughout the locally sourced menu: Bibimbap, a Korean stone bowl cooked rice dish, and Kimchi gracing it's Ruben for a garlic-y spice kick.  Sujeo is a complete departure into Pan-Asian flavors. All created with local fresh and extremely high quality ingredients. Chef Miller is straying into some seriously deep Asian waters for the Cuisine at Sujeo.  With a single visit to Sujeo with a few dining companions we visited China, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Chef Miller has cherry picked some of the best dishes from the wide Asian World and made them his own. Each dish is well prepared, using the highest quality ingredients from around Wisconsin and the US. Each dish has been refined to the point of culinary masturbation. Can great food be so rich and flavorful that it makes you feel dirty?  Imperial roll  The imperial rolls were a ground pork and shrimp roll. Shrimp and pork are commonly mixed together in Vietnamese and Cantonese cooking to make the most flavorful and interesting fillings for dumplings. This is a rice paper wrapped spring roll which has been deep fried.  Salt and Pepper Squid  This is an interesting take on Salt and pepper seafood Chinese dishes. Generally a whole shell on shrimp or crab is lightly breaded with five spice and black pepper. The R&G lounge in San Francisco is famous for their Salt and pepper Crab. It's a strange dish in that the breading is stuck to inedible shells, but in the process of cracking and extracting the meat you get bits of crunchy peppery goodness in every bite. Madison's new Asian Sweet Bakery on Park street makes a Salt and Pepper Shrimp tasty enough to eat shell and all.  Obviously Squid does not have a shell but the light and peppery breading is similar to other salt and pepper Chinese dishes.  Chili Crab is a dish I've only seen in Singapore. It's one of the specialties of that region. In Singapore and Malaysia a chili sauce thickened with eggs is liberally doused over a screamingly fresh crab from Sri Lanka. The mythology surrounding these Sri Lanka crabs is that they grow big and fat in the Bay of Bengal feasting on the outpouring from the Ganges river, a holy river in India which is used as a cremation and burial ground. They say it is this which makes Sri Lanka crabs the best in the world.  Nom Nom Nom  Chef Tori has decided instead of using the \"one-step from cannibalism\" (delicious BTW) crab to using West Coast Dungeness crab. A very tasty and more local substitute. The Chili sauce it came with was honestly better then some of the best places in Singapore. Sweet, salty, spicy, this dish really hits on all cylinders.    Spicy Red Curry with long beans, pickled ginger and crispy shallots. I was expecting a Thai style curry. But boy was I wrong. This was much less balanced then a thai Curry light on spiciness and heavy on sweetness. The closest thing I have had to a curry like this is an Indonesian pork curry often served in a rijstaffel meal. Pork Rendang is one of my favorite dishes around the world and one which is nearly impossible to find outside of either Southeast Asia or The Netherlands. The only thing lacking in this dish was the spicy :(  Their Ramen was absolutely killer. The first few bites were overwhelmingly ginger flavored but that quickly mellowed out with the strong deep flavor of the sea. To me it tasted very strongly of crab roe, ginger, and pork fat. It was absolutely a unique (in my experience) and amazing bowl of Ramen. It was so complex it was almost confusing, but in the end was addictively good.  The KBC chicken served with a bevy of Banchan (little picked sides in Korean cuisine) is at once a very American dish and a very Asian one. Steaks, hamburgers, apple pie, Asian people know what these dishes are and might have had them before, but the ubiquity of KFC in Asia is of epic proportions. Fried chicken has become an Asian staple. They even have knock-off KFC's in a lot of the Asian world!  One of my dining companions called the curry \"Dusky\", and it's a perfect description for that dish. The flavors are deep, sweet, salty, and they taste of the depths of dark Soy Umami. The perfect blend of sweet soy and caramelized protein.  That characterizes all of the food at Sujeo. Deeply flavorful, joyously seasoned and only perfectly describable in terms that have nothing to do with food.  Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"We've generally really liked our experiences at Sujeo and that brings them up to a 3-star rating, but service today for lunch was awful. We sat down and ordered egg rolls and an order of chicken ramen to split. Got our egg rolls a good fifteen minutes later and then had to ask for our ramen to go because it took another twenty minutes.  The place was practically empty so who knows what happened.   The food itself - egg rolls were decent. Nice and crispy, and the filling is filled with meat, veggies and all the good stuff but when biting into it, the middle was still cold.   The ramen - A+ on noodle texture and slurpiness. But the broth was a little too salty and the portion was less that I was expecting. When we asked for it to go, instead of separating the noodles from the broth as one might expect... They put two containers of half of the order in each... So as it sat in the car, things got soggy and less than ideal.  I'd order this again because it was a good chicken and ginger broth, but really would love less sodium.   I'll probably go back again as I do like their dandan noodles, but not very often.  Also apparently they no longer do dimsum brunch (bummer) and the congee is no longer on the menu (bigger bummer)"}
{"text":"Don't get the luxury rice, it tastes like $10 takeout and is not worth the $34! Very greasy too. But, do get the appetizers, all are amazing! Especially loved Daikon, beets, and brussel sprouts. Drinks were also very good!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give a five star review, but I didn't have a 5 star experience.  There were 4 of us for dinner on a Wed. evening.  We sat down and it took close to 10 minutes for anyone to even talk to us.  Our server was completely uninterested, provided nothing beyond copying down our order.  It would have been better to have an iPad like in the Minneapolis airport.    The ambiance of the restaurant is really lackluster.  It's just downright boring.    The food.  Well this was the high point.  Three of us gave the food itself 4 stars and one was less enthusiastic with 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong the food was good, but it could have been better.  Or maybe I was just so off-put by the lackluster staff and ambiance that the food couldn't shine through.  I'll likely wait a while and give it a second chance after some time has gone by - maybe they are still ironing out the details.  Update: I got a nice message from the restaurant which earned them another star.  It's nice to know they keep up with Yelp and the message was very nice.  I'll return to Sujeo after a while and see if we can get some more stars added."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. Decent wine list. Can't go wrong bringing people here. Cool interior space also."}
{"text":"Sujeo gives me such an \"ehhhhhhh\" feeling while i'm there. Let me explain why: I go in, look at a menu, and find it really difficult to decipher what's veggie friendly. I ask the waiter, who gives me an annotated menu (and I wonder why they don't just give that to everyone). With this information, I pick what I want to order. Sometimes, that's the end of it. Other times, I'm told they can't make said item because of lack of certain ingredients. So, I look for another option. Sometimes, that's the end of it. Other times, the waiter recommends me against that item because it isn't recommended vegan or something. So, I then proceed to pick from 1 of the 2 remaining choices I have, and i'm obviously not too excited with those choices. So I sit there anxiously waiting for my food, wondering if it's going to be any good, because at this point, I have plenty of doubt instilled in me.  And then I get my food, and it's pretty good. Compared to other Bibimbap's in town, it's on par with Graze's (which is to be expected), and better than Sol's on the Square (but not good enough to justify the $4-5 price difference). I don't have much to say about the other dishes i've had; they're all just decent. I didn't really need to worry, but it just feels like such a chore to order from here. And given that I have only had pretty good food here (Note: Never bad, but never really great), I don't ever feel that inclined to want to come to Sujeo. I've never really had a bad experience here though. It's a good atmosphere, and has attentive servers, so that all helps. Basically, they need to tune better into some of the details, like making the menu less dense to read, and having modifiable options actually be desirable."}
{"text":"I'm a fan by virtue of 1) the atmosphere and 2) the novelty of a Korean place on the east side. That said, it's more of a 3.5 star than a 4. This place suffers from some of the same awkward pretentiousness of Graze, but the cocktail list doesn't pull as much weight and the bar needs to be 2x bigger. The noodles were good if a bit bland. Somewhat surprised at the paucity of vegetarian or vegan options for my animal-loving friends. But I'm holding off on more in-depth reflection until I try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"My first time at Sujeo was about 1 or 2 years ago. When I went, my brother ordered only because I was late for dinner. I don't remember what he ordered but the only thing I actually liked was Sujeo's cheese tukboki. I have two friends who recently went there and brought back a dish that was really good. I decided to give them another try so I went there for a date. I got the Dan Dan noodles and was really disappointed. The noodles were greasy and there were an overwhelming amount of peanuts sprinkled all over the dish. I think I would have liked it way more without the peanuts. My date got the Sujeo Ramen and enjoyed it but said it was too greasy. We also got an order of the Nam Prik Pao Toast and this was the best thing we got from the three different items that we got. I love fusion food however, it's hard for me to personally find a fusion food place that I actually enjoy. I gave Sujeo 3 out of 5 because some flavoring aspects of each dish was great but just not up to my standards. The place is esthetically pleasing and the service is also great. It's worth a try if you are feeling adventurous and to each their own taste buds. I always encourage everyone to try new things and Sujeo isn't one that I would completely write off my list. There are other things on their menu that I'd like to go back to give a chance to."}
{"text":"This place. Wisconsin will never get it. I don't even think Tory really gets it. Solving the Asian American in the Midwest problem is a PhD thesis. Any Asians bent on developing their culture are on the coasts or in a big city. There are not enough of us cheerleading the culture, and our learned Midwestern hospitality doesn't help the cause. Being out in Madison and looking for Asian food is like being out in the wild west looking for a philharmonic orchestra. Even us real, authentic, grown-in-an-Asian-home slant eyes don't get it because we grew up on our own mothers' food, and \"my mom's is better than your mom's.\" Don't get me started on all of us being lumped together despite not knowing much outside of our parents' border designations...  But that's why it's so amazing that this dude who grew up in an American home in Racine is making what is, essentially, the most interesting Asian food in the city.  So. In order to get the most out of Sujeo do something like this: eat here; talk about the food; go to Ha Long Bay and Saigon Noodles; compare the pho; hit up Hong Kong Cafe and Jade Garden; post a funny story about making fried rice; ask Shinji to make more ramen at Muramoto; have some steam buns at Graze and have some steam buns at Umami; post a picture on instagram; comment on your friends' pictures; develop an opinion (my favorite joint is Wasabi); hit up Hong Kong Station or Ichiban or Fugu; then go to Chicago, eat at Fat Rice, drink a lot, crash, and wake up to dim sum at Phoenix.  And bring me along.  ***If all you want is to know what to get to be safe at the scary foreign restaurant: Khao Soi is loud and flavorful and familiar to Thai curry fans. The Shio Ramen is really well executed, rich, and contemplative. Chili Crab is hard to eat on dates (which can be impressive to the sexiest of ladies). The KBC (Korean Broasted Chicken) and the General Tso Chicken Livers are both hip and accessible. Japchae and, I've heard, the BBQ Pan Fry are both accessible but less hip. Also, get the soft serve."}
{"text":"Tory is a great chef and I've had a lot of wonderful meals at his restaurants. He needs to get someone else to handle the music selection. I stopped by the noodle bar at Sujeo on this bitterly cold winter day to get something wonderful and yummy to warm me up. After a while the music caught my attention. Misogynistic, vulgar and violent. I asked one of the staff members about it and they said it was required: Vince Staples on Pandora. Just so you know, here's the lyrics from one of Vince Staples best known songs, Blue Suede:   Bitches ain't shit but hoes, I been knowin' this Niggas gon' snitch regardless, Mitch showed us Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes Eustace Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit 5-0 fucking with the yayo too L-B-P-D get sprayed on too Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof Blowing .40s as a youth, Thump Deuce in the Chevy Hit the corner, run up on him, turn a nigga to Spaghettios  Bitches ain't shit but tricks, I been knowin' that Blowing on dicks for spliffs and Coke Cognac Out club hoppin', hoppin' in Kodak's Where the coke at?

Tory, you can do better for your staff, patrons and the community. Let me know when you clean it up."}
{"text":"Amazing unique dishes. All local foods. We tried some of their signature cocktails as well and we were amazed by everything we tried. Eggs rolls were so crispy and had great flavors. Drink prices were high."}
{"text":"Make a reservation, this place gets packed! I was told that there would be a 40 min wait but luckily someone cancelled their reservation, and i got a table after 20 min. They will take your phone number and text you when your table is ready.  The decor is kinda cool, it was a little too dark for me to see my food properly. I tried the Japchae, which I found way too salty. The kohlrabi salad was very fresh, all the ingredients are locally sourced, however it is extremely sour. Luckily I like sour foods, but if you don't, you will not enjoy this. The bibimbap is excellent, this was the only dish that was not overly salty or sour, it was made just right. You can choose to have it with bulgogi, pork or tofu and I chose bulgogi.  Service was excellent. If you are craving pan asian food, this is a good spot to go to."}
{"text":"My first lunch at Sujeo lived up to the high expectations I had of Chef Tory Miller, Southeast Asian street food, and local Wisconsin ingredients.  We started with the Som Tam salad, where Wisconsin kohlrabi replaces the green papaya from the original Thai version.  It was perfect and didn't feel like an ingredient compromise at all - a great local take on the traditional salad.    En route to the restaurant, I told my friend that there was one particular dish I hoped to see on the menu, and, sure enough, they serve Khao Soi.  This became a favorite of mine on a visit to Chiang Mai, the home of this lovely comfort food curry chicken noodle dish.  While it's not the easiest Thai meal to find in the U.S., I've tried it many times, and Sujeo's Khao Soi is the best I've had in the States and it's right up there with the first bowl I had at the Chiang Mai night market!  It's a little spicier than some, so be sure to take the advice we received from our server and have a taste before you add the chili oil!    We'll definitely be back soon to tour more of the menu!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night to give this place a shot. To be honest, my expectations were low having read the reviews. And it pretty much was exactly what I expected - the food was meh. It wasn't bad, but it was boring. We ordered the ramen, the pho, two egg rolls and a tripe and tongue salad. The server actually forgot to put in the order for our tripe and tongue salad and I had to remind her at the end. They were nice enough to take it off the bill and give it to us for free.    The ramen was just okay. The broth lacked depth and the soft boiled egg tasted oddly sweet. The pork slices with the ramen were overcooked. I enjoyed the pho broth much more, but I wanted it to have a bit more sweetness. Perhaps a bit more cinnamon and anise in the broth would help, but there are just so many better places in town to get a bowl of pho. The egg roll was thick but boring. The tongue and tripe salad was overly oily. It really needed a citric acid to cut through the oil and add some brightness. The most enjoyable part of the meal was my drink which was a concord 75 with champagne and a grape shrub.   I wouldn't come back to this place. I understand it's asian fusion and all but if you're going to fuse already amazing Asian dishes with something else, at least make it interesting. I find this instead a half-hearted effort."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison. The food is incredible (my favorite is the khao soi), the service is friendly, and they have some unique cocktails. Also you must try the egg rolls."}
{"text":"Fine dining cooking precision with superb quality ingredients drenched by overwhelming sauce.  Good portion.  SOFT SHELL CRAB SPECIAL $25 -- 2 crabs.  Comes with a bowl of rice soaked in sauce.  The best soft shell crab I've ever had.  Cooked to perfection with excellent tempura batter.  2 exquisite inedible greens drowned by sauce.  Price Comparison: 1 subpar crab sells for $9 as an appetizer.  GENERAL TSO CHICKEN LIVERS $15 -- serves 2+.  A treat to have a mixture of breaded sweetbread and naked livers.  Price Comparison: sweetbread entree usually goes for $8.  DESSERT $3 -- only 1 option.  Rotating soft serve ice cream.  Today, I got the so-called perfect combination of Vanilla Bourbon and Gritty Guava (interesting texture).  SERVICE -- pleasant.  Informative.  Cordial.  But, if you make a negative comment, the person looked blanked and unable to address the issue.  VENUE -- clean.  Only 1 restroom stall for male or female.  No excessive boozing allowed...avoid the wait line.  LOL. Impressive frequent sanitation.  NOTE TO SUJEO:  please consider the effect of sauce into premium ingredient combination.  Sauce on the side.  A dot on each ingredient maybe.  You are a fine dining group, there is no need to act like a greasy shack.  I look forward to enjoying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Placed a business dinner reservation for 12 people on for a Tuesday via phone and they confirmed my reservation. Upon showing up on Tuesday the restaurant was closed and I had to scramble to find another option. I will never give them my business again."}
{"text":"A good place with clean environment and decent Asian fusion food. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The chef is not taking care of this restaurant AT ALL. We went there bc he is award winning chef, but the food was horrible. If he opened this restaurant under his name, he should take care of it. Whoever works in the kitchen has no idea or common sense of what korean food is.   Korean fried chicken is $18, but three pieces came out with bowl of rice. If you ever had korean fried chicken before, this price should be considered as fraud. The sauce was absolutely terrible.  Sujeo ramen was too watery. They should name it as \"soup\" instead of \"ramen\".  Bibimbop was aight, but it is $18, which does not worth it at all. It was the most expensive bibimbop I'd ever had."}
{"text":"Great food. The bibimbap is really good, so are all of the starters.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sujeo is an interesting place. The place gives a modern, trendy vibe. The menu flexes the farms that they source their ingredients from (just like all of Tory Miller's restaurants). They serve American-inspired pan Asian cuisine. In short, they're a hipster Asian fusion restaurant.  Because I am an Asian yuppie in the area, I go to Sujeo a lot. I'm probably the perfect example of their target demographic. Over the years, I've tried a lot of their menu items, and I have my opinions.  Let's start with my favorites. I absolutely love their late night noodle bar on Fridays and Saturdays. They come up with a cool new noodle dish every week, and it sure beats getting late night pizza. I also love their korean chicken wings. It's a cross between ultra crispy korean chicken and buffalo wings with blue cheese. I'm not positive, but I think the blue cheese dressing is made with kewpie which is tasty Japanese mayonnaise. The Lao sausage dish is pure genius. Make sure to get a little bit of everything in every bite for a spicy party in your mouth with all sorts of textures from the crispy sticky rice, pickled greens, and meaty sausage. The new pho has freaking bone marrow in it, so it's a great option if you want to bring home a bone for your dog. The bibimbap has a very authentic flavor, and the subtle flavor of the sesame oil and stone bowl really make it shine. Their rotating soft serve tends to be really interesting, and I rarely leave without a swirly cone.  While there are a lot of things I love (especially on their new menu), Sujeo also makes some dishes that I find quite mediocre. Mapo tofu and dan dan men are usually my favorite things to order at szechuan restaurants. However, they're pretty bad at Sujeo. The dan dan noodles are pretty flavorless, and the noodles are mushy. The eggplant mapo tofu sounds awesome in theory, but it's also pretty flavorless. It's not very hot or numbing, and it's kind of tangy for some reason. The kimcheese sounds cool in theory, but it's basically like eating a spicy Handi-Snack. I also never like their drinks. My final complaint is the service. While they're always super nice and helpful, I find myself waiting a long time for my food compared to other restaurants.  Because there's a lot of awesome and not awesome stuff happening at once, I think that averages my experiences at Sujeo to 4 stars. I recommend checking it out, and I encourage you to go again if you don't like it the first time since their menu can be so hit or miss."}
{"text":"Would be a solid 4 star but the music selection (rap - like, recent rap) pushes it up to a 5. Nice to have a late night place in Madison that feels like it could be in a real city.  Make sure you at least split an order of the KBC - I have wet dreams about that stuff."}
{"text":"Bibimbap comes out in a HOT stone bowl - hear the sizzle - the rice was perfectly crispy by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl. The squash curry dish was quite tasty and a great vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Interesting dishes and great flavors are the backbone of this restaurant.  Our appetizer of salt and pepper squid was nicely seasoned but the crispy chili mayo was just ok.  Their homemade kimchi and various picked vegetables were amazing with the rice and grilled steak sliders \"Ssam\".  My wife and I shared the dish and had plenty left over.  My only disappointment was that the strip steak was not the best cut and had a lot of tough fat on it.  The flavor was spot on though and the salt and black and white sesame seeds were a great topping.  They have interesting drinks as well.  A cool place to try if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but not my favorite either. Appetizers were pretty good. We had spring rolls, a spicy chili egg plant dish, and their salt and peppered squid. The squid was a little greasy and had lots of tentacles.  As far as main dishes, they were good. I had a bbq pork which was excellent. My husband had Bipnbop and he said it was ok. My FIL had the crab and that dish was s mess! He did say it was tasty.   The weight staff was nice, but was not super knowledgable. The custard was good, but by no means was it the best I've had. I thought it was an interesting dessert choice for an Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Good service and great ramen noodle bowls. Full service bar and also have appetizers and other stuff. Chicken ramen was delicious ask for spicy sauce on side. Service is A+!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance : Clean and functional is the outlook of this place. Very metropolitan!   Service : Pleasant with a casual overlay to it!  Food :  For a Korean Fusion this ticks a lot of boxes, at-least for what I tried. We had a go at their Pot Stickers (Pork n Shrimp), Fried Squid and Spare Ribs.  The pan fried Pot stickers I'd say were a 3.5/5. The filling was sumptuous and ample but the dough was a little too thick so at times it'd get chewy.   The Salt and Pepper fried Squid on paper seemed like any other \"fried calamari\" being served at virtually every restaurant on the planet (Exaggeration alert!!).. Yet we decided to try it out coz it looked inviting in images! And it surely was!! The batter was thin enough to not be intrusive and yet hold the squid from falling out. The seasoning was just right and that Chili Mayo side was a spike to your taste buds!! Yummmm  My favorite however were the ribs. They were in some sort of a black bean sauce meets lots of pepper. The result was this sticky marmalade coating that drenched each rib and burst with flavor and spice with every single bite!! The ribs were cooked very well to the point of being fall of the bone.  Value and final thoughts : Good portions, good prices (Avg $13 per dish). Recommended!!"}
{"text":"The veggie ramen is one of the best I've ever had.  It cleared my stuffy head and warmed my belly on a chilly \"Spring\" day.  Our server was really helpful on what could and couldn't be modified vegetarian and why they have cold sake instead of hot (better flavor quality).   I like the whole open design of the place, the big smile the chef replied with when I thanked him as I left made my day.  Even if it looks like a mustard bottle exploded inside there...."}
{"text":"After my initial review, Sujeo reached out and offered an opportunity to try them again.  I always value a restaurant that reads and takes feedback (both positive and negative). On Friday, I did just that and my opinion is still unchanged. My girlfriend and I decided to try out the noodle bar on visit #2.  I went with the Dan Dan noodles while she went with the Bun Cha. My Dan Dan noodles were well prepared but the sauce that was described as \"spicy peanut\" definitely had spice but lacked a strong peanut flavor.  The oiliness of the sauce left a sheen in my bowl. After the heavily sauced Dan Dan, I thought the Bun Cha was a refreshing change of pace.  The Thai sausage was just on the verge of being underdone but I appreciated the flavor of the seasonings used.  The vegetables were fresh and the nuoc cham that was drizzled over the rice vermicelli noodles was the perfect blend of fish sauce, acidity, and sweetness.  A solid dish but at $16, I don't see the value.  Yes, the sausage is homemade but for 2 links, some noodles, carrots, daikon. cucumber, and some greens, I can't wrap my head around the price point.  This was my view, as well,  during my first visit.  I have no qualms paying a high price but the food absolutely has to warrant it.  Unfortunately, Suejo doesn't warrant it. I don't think I will be back for a third visit.  There are just too many other places in the Madison area that are churning out consistent food on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"I ate here with some girlfriends on a Thursday night. We didn't have to wait long and the wait allowed us to look over the cocktail menu. Usually Korean restaurants don't serve craft cocktails so offering them is a plus!   There was only one bartender who was busy helping the party of 4 while we were mostly ignored. But we quickly got called to our table and ordered drinks that way. I had the mango tequila cocktail and the chai one. The mango one was good but could have been spicier. So, order it. Extra spicy!  The chai one tasted like someone spiked my chai tea in a \"that's really different\" tasting kind of way. I probably wouldn't order that again.  For eating, we shared the chili eggplant appetizer and squid. The squid was just normal deep fried calamari. It was just fine. The eggplant was pretty good and came sprinkled with Thai Basi and tofu. I really enjoyed it. For dinner, I shared a bibimbap with the spicy sauce on the side (a recommendation from our server, which ended up being a great recommendation because then we could also use the sauce on the table n addition to what it came with). This was pretty good but when you live in a large metro area with tons of amazing Korean food, this Madison bibimbap was just a but sub par to what I've had before.  So based on the other reviews of this place, the food was decent, drinks made this experience better and the service was attentive. Im not sure if it's worth an hour wait but if you haven't ever tried Korean, it's probably the place to go. I would also recommend this as a good first date place. It's not loud and you get to be adventurous with your food order and again, the cocktails. The only other thing I'll mention is they have \"fancy\" silver-looking chopsticks. Whatever they are made out of makes using chopsticks even more difficult, so I asked for their regular takeout chopsticks that made me feel less clumsy."}
{"text":"I went with the family in late April on a Sunday for lunch. The food was good and the space was comfortable. I had the bibimbap, which I thought was okay; Babe had the bahn mi which I really liked. My parents had the dan dan noodles which were very tasty."}
{"text":"There were a lot of issues that need to be resolved. One of my entrees was very good. I got a thai egg as an appetizer that was watery and it was mainly a salad which was not what I wanted. It took them an hour to bring me my appetizer and when we asked them where our food was they kept saying they'd check then would never get back to us. Finally our waitress comes back and we ask where our food is after it had been an hour and 20 minutes since we had ordered and she runs back and is talking to the manager and puts things into the computer (clearly she hadn't put our order in) the manager comes up to us and says that due to the fact that someone in our party had a gluten allergy they had to clean all of the dishes extensively. Just tell us the truth if you didn't put our order in! The service really needs help here and it could potentially be a great restaurant in the future but not yet. They were nice enough to discount part of our bill though."}
{"text":"Got there early and ate from the bar menu. Excellent martini!  Spring roll was awesome. Have forgotten (and could neither spell nor pronounce) my entre - sweet potato noodles with steak very good and an exceptional portion.  Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I've finally had the chance to get back to this place and try the full menu. I, unlike others here, am not all that familiar with the chef who runs these restaurants. I will say that my last meal at his fancy and pricey, L'ettoille was pretty terrible, and although I've tried Graze twice, I was not all that impressed. James Beard or not, you have to bring something more impressive to those two places in my opinion. They appear to be resting on well-established reputation than on truly excellent dining experiences. This place, however, I'm in love with, and feel that this is indeed this chef's forte. This restaurant has a local farm to table angle which is unusual for this type of cuisine.   On the most recent visit we brought a party of four which allowed us to try numerous dishes. The restaurant itself is divided into a casual noodle bar with a view of the hard-working kitchen, and a more formal space with a full Asian-fusion menu with Korean leanings.   We started with two table snacks, the spiced peanuts and the beef jerky. We were all craving more of the peanuts very quickly. The jerky was delicious and had a nice spicy bite to it. I've had Thai beef jerky at other places and I'd say that this one could be a little less dry. It was delicious though. These were paired with a couple creative craft cocktails that would, on their own, bring me back.  We moved on to:  Kohlrabi Salad - carrots, cherry tomatoes, apples, long beans, shrimp, herbs, peanuts, tamarind sauce  Kohlrabi is a somewhere between a turnip and cabbage and is also known as \"German turnip\" or \"turnip cabbage\". This salad was delicious and had us all scraping up ever last bit of it. One thing that should be noted in the description is that the shrimp are the little dehydrated shrimp that you find in Thailand. They add a nice, salty punch to the salad. This was sort of a creative twist on a Thai green papaya salad.  Next up:  Cheesy Ddeokbokki - rice cake, lap cheong, Bandaged Cheddar, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, crushed egg, kimchi, gochujang  One of the most unusual dishes I've come across in a long time. I'm a huge fan of Pleasant Ridge Reserve cheese so had to see how it was incorporated into this dish. This was a hearty, cheesy tribute to Wisconsin by way of Korea. Really good, and bravo on the creativity shown.  Bibimbap - meats of the day, vegetables, rice, fried egg, ssamjang, served in a hot stone bowl  Perhaps the most recognizable of Korean dishes, Bibimbap is a heated stone bowl filled with rice, veggies, meat, etc. An egg is then cracked over the top and cooks by virtue of the heat of the dish itself. This one was spot on with super fresh ingredients. Delicious.   Pork Curry - spicy red curry, beans, pickled garlic, crispy shallots  Wonderful, although I did add a bunch more spice using the unique Kim-Kim sauce they keep on hand. I would prefer that they ask how spicy I'd like it. This was too tame for our tastes.  We cooled our mouths with some wonderful homemade soft-serve ice cream in unique flavors like balsamic and basil.   Service was a bit too casual (as in the waitress didn't know the menu well and was a bit scarce).   Overall, BRAVO. This one hits it out of the park. When back in Madison, I'm heading right back here."}
{"text":"My 2nd experience at Sujeo was much better than my first. Having gone with a large group I got to sample many dishes!  Appetizers Kohlrabi salad- very refreshing! I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.   Thai egg salad- looks a lot like the kohlrabi salad but with egg. Tasty as well!   Sichaun beef tongue salad- I enjoyed this much more than last time, the seasoning was not as overpowering and salty.   Chili braised eggplant- a lot of people enjoyed this but I thought it was just ok. I thought the eggplant could have been cooked just a tad more.  Ddeobokki- enjoyed this, tasted pretty authentic!  Entrees General Tso chicken livers- a huge portion. Good for 2 people. But I thought the dish tasted a little heavy, the sauce was the thick and sugary and I could only handle maybe 3 or so pieces. Ok but not my fav dish.  Grilled Thai sausage- interesting flavor but was way too dry.  Hot pot- for 25 or so dollars this is a pretty good deal. The broth was great and veggies were tasty. Seemed a little stingy on the meat considering how much you are paying. I enjoyed this more than the Ssam I had last time...but the Ssam always changes.    All in all I enjoyed the apps way more than the entrees  The homemade custard was still delicious. Definitely get it! They had two flavors and said they could swirl them but I asked if they could do one on top of the other and they kindly obliged! The rhubarb was tart but not overly so. Peanut butter was good but I would not be able to eat a whole cone of it because it's a little heavier."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and am still going to give it 4* because of the dish my husband ordered.  There was about a 45 minute wait when we got there...no big deal, we waited it out at the bar.   We had the Ddeokbokki appetizer, which was actually very, very good. Not fishy at all and very flavorful.   I had the Lechon Kawali and it was ok. The pork belly was kind of dry, but the tomatoes were as fresh and as ripe as they are in the summer. Overall, a decent dish, but probably not something I would order again.   My husband had the Bokkeumbap and was absolutely IN LOVE with his dish. It was incredibly flavorful, slightly spicy, smoky.. a \"party in your mouth\" as he described it. I highly recommend this dish.   I guess part of my disappointment with this place was that our waiter didn't really seem to know his stuff. On top of that, we went two days after New Year's Eve and they were trying to sell the rest of their NYE feature, suckling pig. Our waiter completely failed to mention it to us. It's been on my husband's bucket list of food to try, so we probably would have ordered it if we had known about it.   Overall it was a decent experience, but didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"This is a revision of my previous review, which really wasn't a review because we went for late night dining on a Saturday and the restaurant was closing for the night despite several social media websites including Yelp which said Sujeo served late.   After management read my review they contacted me, apologized and sent me a gift card. This is clearly a restaurant that wants it's potential customer base to be happy despite miscommunication across the Internet.     This evening, a Sunday we were able to score a 2-top without a reservation. The tables are a bit small and beware, the servers behind, buttocks may be sort of in your personal space when they are attending to your neighbors table.   The menu is pretty big and required explanation to the newbie. Despite the very friendly and helpful waitress, I think I would  have preferred something else as a main dish.   We ordered the braised eggplant as an appetizer - this was very good with a nice sweet and salty flavor profile with a nice hint of heat. The timing was a bit off as our appetizer arrived with the main course.    We ordered something called Ssams as a main course to share. This is a large serving of a protein with a variety of Korean pickled condiments, Bib lettuce, and delightful fluffy little rice buns. The condiments were really the highlight of our meal.   We chose the Ssams special, which tauted as a braised pork shank, that had been portioned and fried. The pork itself was crispy, but bland and extremely fatty. I didn't notice amount of fat until I'd stuffed some of the delicate rice buns and piled on the condiments.   In fairness the fattiness of the pork may have been customary to the dish and the cuisine, and just not for me or my trusty dining companion. This said over half of the meat portion was simply deep fried and sliced white fat. A better explanation of what we were getting into would have been helpful.   When I inquired about the fattiness of the meat, explaining that perhaps it was me and maybe the dish just was not particularly my thing, the waitress very politely apologized and we had a nice conversation about the nature of the proteins on the menu. The Korean style is to leave all the fat on the cuts of meat.  The hostess then followed up with us and graciously picked up our appetizer and my companions cocktail.   There also seems to be an issue with Sujeo's exhaust fan. It blows right into the parking garage. When we pulled into the parking garage it was visibly smoky. I'm not sure if it was a carry over, but the dining room seemed to smell a bit smoky as well.   Look the menu is pretty robust and I'm not going to fault a restaurant for serving me something I've never had that turned out not to be my thing. Management clearly cares about trying very hard to make a good impression. There are plenty of other choices on the menu and I'll be back to try out one of the many other interesting things on the menu.   Sujeo's chef proprietor has the chops to make this place work. I think Sujeo will get there. The menu alone adds some real depth to a generally predictable downtown Madison dining scene. I want to like this place given how hard they seem to be trying."}
{"text":"Not thrilled. I was all ready to love it, but it didn't happen. We went for lunch. I found the dishes heavily sauced when I was looking for fresher and more delicate. I ordered the Bokkeumbap, which admittedly was in the rice section, but found it to be almost all, well, rice. It looked like it was 2000 calories alone, did not have much meat, but about 2 pounds of rice with lots of sauce. The Japchae was also very heavily sauced. Yes, these are Korean dishes, but they seemed more like Chinese, not packed with meat and sparing on the heavy sauce as are most Korean restaurants.   Ah wait, you say, its FUSION. Of course its not typical Korean! True that. But the issue is how good it is to eat.  there was nothing here that would bring me running back, unfortunately, because I was running to try it."}
{"text":"This is my first review because this place deserves 5 stars.  The cocktails are complex and quenching, the custard was playful and unexpected and pleasant.  A great end to an amazing meal.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"We were hosting a vegetarian and wanted a veg friendly restaurant. Sujeo seemed like it would be a good fit.   We clearly explained our eating preferences to the waiter and he was kind enough to check which broths in soups would be okay. For instance their Miso is veg friendly while their KimChi chigae is not. Korean food is meant to be very communal and family style, so we wanted everybody to be able to partake in as many dishes as possible.   Three of the seven banchan were very disappointing. Inexplicably, especially as we asked for an all vegetarian banchan, the waiter brought out a macaroni salad with ham in it. He took it away, but had nothing to replace it with it.   Beyond this faux pax, two of the kimchis simply sucked. Both the cabbage and radish kimchi were either too old, ill-prepared or both. The miso soup was also very underwhelming.   The pickled cucumber with spicy bird chilis and szechuan peppercorns was perfect. The pickled daikon was also very good. The fern stems were outstanding. There was also another kimchi (sunchokes?) that I'd never had. It was fresh and perfectly prepared.   The deobokki reminded my Korean husband of his childhood. Tender rice and fish cakes in a savory/sweet gochujang sauce. I felt bad that our veg friend couldn't partake.  The veg bimbimbop was also very good. Perfectly cooked crispy bits of tofu and the stone pot put an incredible sear on the rice.   The veg ramen was hit and miss. The mushroom broth was inoffensive but not necessarily good. It was incredibly under seasoned. After asking for salt, I probably added a half teaspoon. It was also too oily. The accompanying vegetables in the soup were uninspired.   But the ramen noodles are to die for. They're whole-wheat, which made me initially suspicious. Regardless, they have the perfect texture and an incredible flavor. They also use them in the pork ramen and I imagine that dish is much more successful. I could have eaten the noodles all by themselves. They're that good.   Lastly, the bottled KIm Kim sauce on each table is disgusting. If you have any familiarity with Korean food you'd think it would be a standard gochujang based sauce. Somehow it's all wrong and very not Korean. Possibly it has way too much vinegar? Luckily it's easily avoidable. Don't pour it on your food without tasting it first.   A very mixed review. Some things, the actual ramen noodles, the bimbimbap, some of the banchan were outstanding. But there were some real disappointments too. I realize Sujeo is a fusion restaurant, but that doesn't excuse the two awful kimchis."}
{"text":"Just no spark. The menu is sort of a mess-- the \"Biggie/Smalls\" thing is cute at best, and more just confusing. Are we doing small plates, or entrees or what? And then a noodle bar section below? Not working. The asian influence feels sort of sadly half-hearted (see the drink menu), and the food, when it comes down to it, was okay. The Khan Soi was fine, but it wasn't overly flavorful, and not a huge fan of the bone in chicken with skin."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights  1) incredible food 2) poor service  3) nice ambiance   We wanted so badly to love Sujeo! The head chef here owns Graze on the square which is my all time favorite, so our expectations were high!  Sujeo is located on East Wash so walkable from the square but only if you are in the mood for some walking (about .6/.7 miles from the square).  Reservations are recommended, we made ours the day of and there were limited times available.   We waited at the bar when we got there, and the bartender was super nice! The drinks were really strong and very obscure.  When we were seated is when the service really started to go down hill. We waited a really long time for someone to bring us water and take our order. The server brought us the wrong drinks, and then didn't bring us the correct ones until we asked a second time. Finally, he forgot one of our meals and didn't realize until about 5 minutes later when we brought it up to him. Not at all what we expected from Sujeo!   Unlike the service, the food is amazing! The dishes were really interesting and presented beautifully! We tried the bibimbap, egg rolls, honey butter chips, and a spicy noodle dish.   Overall, cool Asian fusion place near the square just don't have high service expectations!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Valentine's date night. I had the bibimbap with tofu which came out sizzling. It's always great when you can hear your food and the crispy rice in the bowl was amazing! The dish was a little salty for my taste, but then again I don't really use a lot of salt in my cooking. We also got the Khao Soi, which lives up to the spiciness that it says on the menu. There is plenty of chicken and noodles in it! However if you're not experienced with chopsticks it can be a little difficult to eat.  We also ordered one of the signature cocktails as it was happy hour. We got the Jinerally Speaking which was light and refreshing. Would be a perfect drink to sip on in the summer."}
{"text":"Early Friday night dinner proved to be inconsistent- greeted with smiles and prompt seating, the service onward was inconsistent, not horrible, but polite.  The bad: salt and pepper squid was almost all breading, paired with the chili mayo it ended up tasting overpriced at $11  The decent: I had the bbq pan fried noodle and the chai Sui pork was phenomenal- but because it was described as pan fried I (wrongly) assumed that there would be crispy noodles. Instead I found the noodles to be overly greasy- I mostly picked out the meat.  The great: the lechon Kiwali was as good as any filipino restaurant I've been to. The pork belly was crispy and delicious, the tomatoes the perfect balance and the vinegar sauce was best complement. It's a good portion and its simplicity hit all the marks.  The soft serve ice cream choices were guava and chocolate- both were great.  I would come back, but only for the lechon Kiwali."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night for the first time with some friends. I have honestly been going in and out of the apartment complex that this restaurant is attached to for months now and every time I gawk over how amazing it smells going past this restaurant. So finally a groups of friends and I decided it was time to try it. We went around 7pm on a week night so we had no issues getting a table and I assume it is like that most nights of the week, but as it goes in Madison, the weekends inevitably bring on long waits.   When we arrived we were greeted by a perfectly sweet hostess and server that continued to give us fabulous service throughout the meal, checking up on us frequently and giving us more than enough suggestions on what to enjoy on the menu. Each meal was presented with a little guideline about how best to eat it from the cooking staff such as stirring up the bipmbap and noddle dishes because they are layered at first. But I thought this was a lovely touch to their service that clearly showed they wanted you to enjoy your dish as much as possible. I wish I could've tried some of the appetizers like the pork buns or the potstickers because I watched them come out of the kitchen throughout the meal and they smelled/looked fantastic. So if you get the chance to go there I certainly recommend coming with a big appetite so that you can try as much as possible.   My friends and I all got separate dishes that looked absolutely fantastic. I went with the bipmbap with spicy tofu, although you get choices of meat to go in if you would rather have those, my choices were beef and pork, but I was feeling the tofu so it wouldn't be too heavy of a dish. When you're given the bipmbap you're warned that the dish it is served in is piping hot and not to touch it (you should definitely listen to that). One thing I love about the bipmbap dish is the crispy rice that comes at the bottom, and when you're given your food here the rice isn't actually crispy yet, you're supposed to let the rice sit on the sides of the bowl to crisp. So even though they tell you to mix up your dish throughout the meal in order to keep the food hot, you actually aren't going to get any of the crispness if you push around the rice off the sides of the bowl. Additionally, bipbmap always comes with an egg on top (another reason why I am obsessed with this meal), but when they serve it to you the egg isn't fully cooked, but is placed on the side of the bowl so that it continues to cook and supposedly as you stir your food around the egg will cook more. I am going to be honest and say I am not sure my egg cooked all the way through, which is slightly concerning, and I feel like it would be better if they cooked the egg a little more so you wouldn't have to worry about eating a raw egg. So although there are a few iffy portions of this dish I ate almost all of it because it was so delicious. The spicy sauce that the meat is covered in is very spicy, but also the perfect blend of spices that you honestly can't stop eating. I highly recommend this dish, but just beware of the crispy rice/egg concerns.  All in all, this place had wonderful service and fabulous food. I know some reviews haven't been all that great, but if you're looking for Asian fusion in Madison I think this is most definitely your best bet."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with a friend last night and overall it was okay.  We sat at the noodle bar, since we didn't want to wait an hour for a seat in the other area of the restaurant.  Overall, I liked the vibe of the restaurant, but the food was mediocre.  I ordered the japchae.  The portion size was plenty, but it was lacking in the layers of Korean flavor that I typically expect from japchae.  There was definitely a strong note of sesame oil, almost too much, and it was a bit greasy.  I also thought it was strange to have tomatoes in the japchae and it didn't really fit the rest of this noodle dish.  My friend order the jamppong.  With her being Korean, she was very critical trying this dish.  I didn't try her jamppong, but she said it was a little disappointing due to a lack of authentic Korean flavor.  I liked that we didn't have to wait at all to sit at the noodle bar and the service overall was pretty good.  The only thing that was strange was that since I order the japchae, a waiter came over, tried to explain to me that he needed to cut up my noodles because they were really long, and then proceeded to cut up my noodles.  I know that this is tradition in Korean culture, but this guy was just awkward and it made my friend and I feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing!  The flavors surprise you but compliment each other so well.  The Squash Blossom Rangoon is a must, kudos to chef Jamie Hoang!"}
{"text":"I've got to say-I had high hopes for this place, especially since it was coming from Tory Miller, but man was I disappointed. My first time here was a week or two after it had opened. I ordered the japchae. It was okay, but not great. I knew from the beginning that Sujeo was going for a more local farm to table type of deal and would use more local ingredients as opposed to authentic Asian ingredients. I fully support the idea of using local ingredients! My first experience was a three star, but not bad enough to keep me from coming back.  My SECOND time was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE! (I'm sorry to say this, because I really did hope this place had such potential) i got FOOD POISONING!!! I ordered the Bun Cha noodle dish from the noodle bar last week with the Thai sausage. The noodle dish was extremely salty and I should have been more reserved with the dressing I guess. However, I was so hungry I ate it all-including all of the sausage. After the meal, I had a pretty bad stomach ache, but thought it was because I ate so much.  The next morning was like pure hell. I woke up super early and felt like I was going to die. It took me five days to recover fully-I was finally able to eat food on the third day.  I will not be heading back there. Tory Miller, you're other places are great, but this one is definitely not of the same caliber. I also heard from a friend that her coworker also got really sick after eating here. I don't know what that person ate though...  The only reason why I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I like they're cocktails. They have great cocktail names."}
{"text":"Coming here with a large group (courtesy of Matt W., thanks for making that UYE happen!) was a great move. We ordered appetizers to share/pass around, and got to try many things that we normally wouldn't have ordered ourselves. The kohlrabi salad, salt & pepper squid, and Thai egg salad were among some of my favorites. We also ordered  the Sichuan beef tongue salad, which tasted like tender brisket. I would have liked to have experienced more of that ma la numbing heat that is characteristic of Sichuan cuisine, but instead, a light hand was used in seasoning this dish.  For my entree, I went with the pho bo, which was pretty disappointing for me. The broth  was on point, and so were the beef meatballs (which tasted like they were made in house, not too much gristle). The problem I had with this dish was the noodles. They felt off, like they were maybe noodles you would use to make pad thai. And they were on the al dente side, which was not good. Not many people at the table got noodle dishes, and they seemed pretty satisfied. I heard people sing the praises of the General Tso Chicken Livers, the special of the night (Hen of the Woods?), the hot pot, and the pork curry. So maybe the noodles were not the way to go. I did not have any room for dessert but the flavors for that night were peanut butter and rhubarb.  Service was pretty slow but it was expected. Sujeo seemed to be consistently busy the whole time we were there, plus we were a large group. Be prepared to wait for a long time unless you are willing to sit at the bar. I would say this place has some room for improvement, and I would probably go back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Have been to Sujeo twice now, and will certainly be returning in the near future.  The restaurant space is a bit small, and thus far that's meant there will be a decent wait for a table, and large groups (8+) likely need to split up in order to cut down on the wait time for a table.  The drinks are very good, I've sampled a few of the offerings this far and have come away pleased each time, with the Roof Party Viral Pop probably being my favorite.  As for the food, the offerings have been far and away the best Asian food I've had in Madison, though that isn't necessarily the highest of praise as the city seems fairly devoid of anything that compares to what you can get in more major cities.  The first thing I tried was the Japchae, which while decent felt like it was missing...something.  Whether that was more spice, or just some additional flavor, I'm not sure, but I wouldn't recommend ordering it despite the promising mix of ingredients that are involved.  The second time around I went with the Dan Dan noodles which were much, much better.  Spicy, delicious, I felt full about half way through but powered through to polish off the plate.  Others in my group gave rave reviews to what they ordered (though unfortunately I don't recall what they had).  One must is to get the custard at the end of the meal.  It's just 3 bucks for a nice sized cone, and it's yet to disappoint.  At times I even make my way down to the restaurant just to grab some dessert since I live in the buiding."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming experience, especially considering the price.  I am fine with a long wait time, if the food is worth it.  In this case, it wasn't.  My boyfriend and I were both pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that I've been a little let down by my experiences at Sujeo. I LOVE Korean comfort food, and was extremely excited by the prospect of there being not one but 2 Korean places within a walk of my house.   The staff are trying hard, really they are, and gave us good service every time as best they could. But they had what seemed to be 3 hostesses (and a manager playing hostess) for their tiny restaurant, but only 3 servers working the floor. Bizarre. I know this because the waitress told me there were only 3 of them tonight (a Saturday night!) plus whomever was working the noodle bar, I assume?  Maybe.  The atmosphere was bizarre. Too eclectic and trying to be very hip, it had zero Korean feel to it's decor, (there was a Japanese beckoning cat statue, that was the closest thing I saw) they were pumping a mix of hip-hop, trance and dance music at a level loud enough to be heard over the crowd in the small place (read: obnoxiously loud) and overall had just a very strange, uncomfortable vibe of trying-so-hard-to-be-cool. It was like being in a pop-up restaurant that had taken over a minimalist cafe-cum-dance club.   And yet, despite the super-chic inside, there is a very severe lack of signage outside to let you know there is a restaurant inside. I thought after a few months they might consider some kind of sign outside, but they still have not. If you were to be driving or walking past the very large apartment building that they are located inside, you would never know they were there unless you walked right up to their door and peered inside. It's not exactly an ideal location in general and suffers from lack of parking and walking traffic, so you'd think a very obvious sign might be useful. It's not like they are intentionally trying to be subtle. I hope not, given what the inside of the place is like.     I've tried several house cocktails, some were good, some ok, some not. One was so unpalatable that no one at the table could drink it. It was some kind of watermelon fiasco that tasted exactly like rotten watermelon rinds with spice, which ended up giving it, I'm so sorry to even say this, a taste like throwing up watermelon. The Thai Iced Tea was good, but I'm a sucker for that and easy to please.  Anyway, food.  I had heard great things about their Korean Fried Chicken, so one time we split that. I regret to say it was basically 4 pieces of very standard fried chicken, just like from KFC down the road, with some ok sauces on the side. Nothing great, I'm not sure why people were raving about it? It was fine, for fried chicken. But if you want regular old fried chicken, there are lots of places for that.    Also, where many Korean places include the sampler of Kimchi & Pickled items, you had to order theirs and pay extra for it. Eh, fine, I love it so ok. It was pretty good, we enjoyed that!    Their ddoekboki (rice noodle cakes in Korean BBQ with fish cakes) were pretty good, the BBQ sauce was excellent!  The rice cakes were a little dry and had the look of having sat under a lamp for a while, but they are one of my favorite foods so I enjoyed them regardless.  Seriously though, that sauce was excellent.   Noodles- all the noodle dishes I have had have been at least acceptable, their bibimbap was pretty good! However on one occasion I was served one that was so salty that I tried to eat it and failed. I was too nice to kick it back to the kitchen, ate half of it and just returned to eating the ddoekboki and banchan.   Overall, the atmosphere is weird and to me a little off-putting, the food and drinks are ok but a little overpriced to be so inconsistently good/bad, the service is good but understaffed, and I get the feeling they are struggling in many respects. Perhaps when the grocery store being built across the way from them gets done they will have better foot-traffic and parking. A sign might help them with this!  In the meantime, I will keep going to Sol's when I want authentic Korean comfort food, and to Umami for ramen.  I really want to like Sujeo, and I know growing into a new storefront isn't easy. I will keep trying occasionally in the hopes that they get around to being a little more consistent with their quality.  In the meantime, all you Sujeo employees, keep your chins up! You work hard and it shows. You rock, and I'm sorry that you have to struggle.  Keep trying!"}
{"text":"I've only had one menu item, but plan to come back for more. Their Khao Soi is incredible - as close as I've come in the states to a recreation of what I experienced in Northern Thailand. At $16, it's just a touch more expensive than it should be."}
{"text":"What a change from the excuse for a bar next door.  Coming into Sujeo on a Saturday night at 8 pm, I was warned it was an hour-hour and a half wait. Okay, we can have a few cocktails next door then come back. Add me to the Noshlist.   When we came back in to Sujeo to grab a drink an hour after being added to the list, we were again greeted, and started looking at the cocktail menu. At this time, our table was ready. We were seated, ordered cocktails and started to browse the menu. Our server approached a few moments after we were seated to explain the menu and to tell us of the daily specials. For a first time visitor and someone not well versed in Korean/Asian cuisine I feel that this is the moment they might become overwhelmed. Our friendly server made it as concise as possible while still giving good details. We placed our app order of potstickers and spring roll, and continued to look at the menu for our entrée option. I settled on the Bun, the second half settled on the pork shoulder bibimbap. The apps came out very quickly and were very good. They were hot, well put together, well seasoned.   The entrees also came out rather quickly (but enough time to finish apps first) and very hot. The bibimbap comes out in a large HOT stone bowl meant to continue/finish cooking the bibimbap as one mixes it all in. I thoroughly enjoyed each of my many sampling bites I had of this dish. My bun was good, the sauce was a bit more bitter and acidic than I was prepared for but the saltiness from the pork and shrimp cut through that. The pieces of the imperial roll that came inside this entrée were my favorite part (but let's be honest...who ever says \"no, I didn't enjoy that deep friend piece of heaven?\").  I do like that part of the restaurant is noodle bar, part seating for the restaurant. I understand why the bar area of soo open to welcome building visitors into the bar, but the bar area feels a bit like the open space is awkward. The side bar portion trys to be bar/counter space but it doesn't really work for the area it is in. But hey, if my only gripe is that the bar and hostess stand is awkwardly shaped/conceptualized, I think I can make do. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Food was great! Everything we had was excellent. Drinks took a little bit but the food far made up for it with it being their first night. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something different but very high end in Madison"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I wasn't expecting much, but I really liked Sujeo.  The KBC tastes similar to the Korean Fried Chicken at Sol's. It's DELICIOUS. The smaller portion is probably enough for one person or is definitely a great size for a shared appetizer. The skin is perfectly crispy and the sauce is wonderfully flavored.  I really liked my spicy Ramen as well, which was enough for 2 meals. I'm no ramen aficionado, but I liked it better than Umami's.  The ambiance isn't much, the place looks like a fast food restaurant. The prices are slightly expensive. But still, I would go back to see if the rest of the food tastes as good!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out this place with my wife.  We had high hopes for Sujeo.  We ordered the following dishes:  Farmer John's Cheese Curds, Cheesy Ddeokbooki, and Shio Raman.  Below is our opinion of the dishes that we've tried:  Farmer John's Cheese Curds: The waitress told us to put the kimchi on the cheese curd and dip it in the sauce to enjoy the play of flavors. We thought the mesh of flavors were overwhelming and did not work together. The flavors were overly sharp and bitter.  The cheese curds, however, were of good quality and tasted best by itself, even though it had a bitter aftertaste (kind of odd).   Cheesy Ddeokbooki: We weren't sure what this dish was supposed to be. To be fair, we've never had traditonal Ddeokbooki, but the cheese didn't work with the dish.  The wife thought that there was also not enough cheese to be called cheesy.  We both agree that the dish was a little messy and lacked substance.   Shio Raman: The best part of the raman was the pork belly (yum).  Other than that, the broth was too fishy and I didn't care for the semi-wavy noodles.  This is definitely not your usual shio raman.  I also prefer Graze's raman (same owner). The broth is not fishy and felt more fulfilling.  Overall, we didn't enjoy our dishes because the flavors didn't work. The menu also appeared to be overpriced.  $18 for bibimbop? $15 for Japchae?   We may come back to try other dishes, but don't recommend the dishes we've tried."}
{"text":"Only a review of their dim sum service -  So  I've REALLY been looking forward to trying this out at Sujeo ever since I heard they were opening and adding this to their menu. Figured I'd give it a couple of months to let them work out the kinks and finally made the trek for dim sum today. All I can say is, highly disappointed, and I think we really gave the whole menu a chance. Which is unfortunate, because I really wanted to love this. The wrappers on both the soup dumplings and har gao were waaaay too think and the filling of the former was super disappointing (good flavor to the har goa filling though). Left to cool, both dumplings because unappetizingly heavy. Taro ball was confusing to say the least - if you're expecting the traditional, that's not what's coming your way so be prepared for that. Spicing on the chicken feet was good but the cook on them was off and they didn't quite reach that awesome gelatinous texture. Meatballs were small, oily and stodgy.   On a separate note, the waitstaff was all over the place and kind of absent-minded and the carts don't come around nearly as much as they should. We ended up trying to hail someone down to get anything we wanted. All in all, no thanks. Y'all have a lot of work to do before charging people $5 a steamer is worth it. You have been warned."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 4 plus my child. The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful and the decor was nice. My food was delicous, I ordered the Pho but the people I went with did not like theirs so much. I would go back again and order the Pho but I am hesitant to try other things on the menu because the party I went with, they all ordered different foods and did not like them"}
{"text":"Dim Sum, Saturday Lunch menu  I've eaten here twice for dinner and enjoyed their mix of fusion pan-asian dishes.  I was particularly interested in trying their dim-sum, as Madison lacks any offering of freshly prepared dimsum... one has to travel to Chicago.  We were in two minds as to whether to go to the age-old reliable Wah-kee for their handmade egg noodles; to umami for ramen noodles, or to try out sujeo's dimsum.  Traffic lead us to sujeo.   The restaurant was surprisingly empty, having only been previously on evenings when there had been a 20-30 minute wait for a table.  The staff were friendly, but not very knowledgeable about what was on offer.  They described dim sum as a \"Korean dumpling style lunch\"... which as a hong kong chinese was a little offensive... and I'm sure Tory Miller would be the first to correct the server... What Sujeo is attempting to do is to give a korean slant to traditional chinese dim sum, and I think they have done a fairly good job of it.   The dim sum cart would come around every 5-10 minutes, which did leave us feeling like it was a prolonged process.  The cart would come with three different dishes, which were described, but they seemed reluctant to open the lids to let us see what was inside.  In the restaurant's defense, it wasn't very busy, so I doubt there was much incentive to load the carts up with plenty of dishes and to push them around frequently.... but then this defeats the object of the cart. You're supposed to have a cart piled high with lots of one dish, so you can push them on hungry diners that can't resist trying new things. In the end we just told them what we wanted and they brought them out.    Two of us shared:  Dim sum $5 each; if ordering dim sum, you get free chinese tea.   1.  Kimchi bao- these were delicious, not quite what we were expecting; the kimchi flavor was subtle, and the bread was a little firmer than we would expect from a typical chinese bao.  The bread was also very greasy, which was the only thing that was disappointing. 4/5  2.  Steamed sticky rice (their version of nor-mei-fan).  This was really interesting and enjoyable.  This was using short grain rice (not the typical glutenous sticky rice in the chinese version), with a good mix of shitake mushroom bits, char siu and chinese sausage, wrapped in leaves.  There was a wonderful smokey flavor to the rice, which isn't usually apparent in the chinese version.  5/5  3.  Siu Long Bao - five little shanghai steamed soup dumplings.  Again, described as a korean dish by the server, but this was a valiant attempt at notoriously difficult to master soup dumplings.  This is so hard to master that many chinese dim sum restaurants fail to do a good job- you really need to find a restaurant that specializes in them (google \"Din Tai Fan\").  This should be a meat dumpling with about a teaspoon's worth of soup within a thin, silky pasta.  Sujeo's version had a thick, doughy outer layer that seemed to have absorbed most of the soup /gelatin found inside.  2/5  4.  Char siu bao (pork bao) - the presentation was of a slightly firm, hand made bun, twisted together at the top.  Again, not a traditional fluffy chinese steamed pork bun, but I really enjoyed this.  The dough used was not as greasy as the kimchi bao, but was quite dense.  The best part of this pork bao was the meat inside.  The ratio of meat to bun was perfect; and the flavor of the meat was really unique.  Bravo!  Sujeo could definitely have relied upon age old charsiu bao recipes but they were intent on creating their own, and this was really successful.  5/5  We also had ordered a ramen shochu which was excellent and larger than we expected... we left feeling very full and quite happy.   The overall price point for the a la carte lunch is a little high- and may explain why it was empty for Saturday lunch- too many of their lunch dishes were in the $12-18 range, which you would not find at Wah-Kee, Dumpling haus or Umami.  Its also not clear why the bibimbap is so much more expensive here than at their other restaurant at Graze.    In summary, I really appreciate what Sujeo is doing for Madison and I will continue to return to enjoy their specials and creations."}
{"text":"Was disappointed...  Got the kimchi stew hot pot special of the day with the tonkatsu.   Kimchi stew hot pot- I don't understand why all that noodle was in there...any one who cooks would know noodles would soak up the soup AND worse is you are making it a hot pot so the soup is being boiled away at the same time. Long story short. Broth was not the flavor I was expecting and it was all noodles. I'm sure if Tory Miller was going for the authentic flavor, it might not appeal to the Madisonians or those not yet familiar with Korean flavors. It is fusion, but some authenticity would be necessary if you are doing Korean.  Tonkatsu... Is very difficult to miss... But Sujeo missed it. The sauce was missing the balance of sweet and salty- it was more soy sauce based salty. The salad would've been elevated with some mayo based or ginger based dressing to balance out the tonkatsu.   The sesame ice cream was too oily...  Mango pineapple custard was delicious."}
{"text":"To be blunt, I think that most of the lower ratings are from customers who either don't understand what \"fusion\" means or simply didn't do their research on this place. The moment you step in, you should NOT be expecting a traditional Korean meal. They even state on their homepage of their website that they are not strictly a Korean restaurant, and that they serve \"pan-asian\" cuisine.   No, do not expect to get all the free Korean side dishes that typically come with a traditional meal. I honestly think that you can infer immediately from the decor and ambience that this place is meant to be more of a nice Asian fusion restaurant - and it succeeds in that attempt.   Conveniently located right underneath the Constellation apartment complex, Sujeo is an Asian fusion restaurant that serves all sorts of asian cuisine, from korean to japanese to vietnamese to chinese. I tried their Dan Dan noodles which were pretty great - certainly different from the \"traditional\" chinese Dan Dan noodles I'm used to having, but that's the \"fusion\" part. The service was a tad bit slow for a Sunday night given that there weren't many people there, but that would be my only real complaint. In general, the restaurant is clean and the decor gives it a classy sort of environment, which you can't find at many Asian restaurants.  I would certainly go again, and I really hope that this place gets more recognition as one of the better Asian fusion restaurants (there aren't many) in Madison!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their small plates and noodles. On a recent trip we had the Honey Butter chips and Miso Ramen noodles which had great flavors and the noddles were perfectly done."}
{"text":"Was not sure what to expect after reading many of these reviews, but What a GREAT place!  Went after the lunch rush, the place (around 1:30pm) was pretty empty, so no issues with getting a table.  The service was top-notch.  I did not feel odd asking questions about the menu and the server was great at explaining and helping.  I ordered the Mango Curry and this dish was Exceptional!! I order the mango curry Every time I see it on a menu and this was by far my favorite one!!  The sauce was amazing!!  I will be back and I will order this dish again!!  My husband tried the Bibimbap and that looked excellent too.  We were both happy and will add this to our favorites!!  I can't wait to come back and try all the cocktails!"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Madison, I can't wait to go back! Went on a Wednesday night, plenty of open tables, no waiting. Waiter was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. Started with the honey butter chips- excellent thin, crispy potato chips drenched in a decadent honey butter sauce. I had the 2-piece kbc, was perfect fried chicken with a sweet/spicy sauce. Companion had the shio ramen, she loved it and didn't want to share with me! We shared the cheesy ddeokbokki, which was wonderfully spicy with intriguing textures- my favorite! Also had the home made soft serve, black sesame flavor, which was kind of weird, but fun to try and cooled down my mouth. I was surprised by how affordable this meal was- all this (and two drinks) for less than $60! I will be back to try some of the other delicious things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night with a group of 5. Took away one star for service. Service was not the best, we had to flag down our waiter a few times for more cocktails and drinks, and less than knowledgable about the beers and food. Another star taken away because the ramen was not good. It did not seem like the broth cooked for very long. The broth had no flavor to it and was very watery. It literally taste like water with fat in it. Not creamy or flavorful like it should be. Took away another star because the atmosphere was just strange. Not a cool hip-vibe like we were expecting. Also, They charge 18 bucks for Bibimbap which is crazy. I got it with steak and I had to search for the steak in the bowl, only a few tiny pieces of steak.  Only good things were the cocktails and beer. We drank the Thai chili infused tequila cocktails and they were delicious.   Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Sujeo, this time with a group of friends.   Service was outstanding, very professional and informative of the specials. We ordered a lot of those to taste, including their special Korean-style sushi roll and a Passionfruit Rum \"slushy\".  The plates were presented beautifully, and all tasted very unique. It was delicious. Definitely be sure to try the Hot Pot, which is plenty for 2-3 people! The Bibimbap is also a super fun dish, served in a hot stone bowl with an egg on top.   Overall, I had a great experience here. The atmosphere, service, and food was spot on. I'll definitely come back for a date night sometime!"}
{"text":"I agree with Kathy B.  The ramen my fiance got was tasteless and watery.  We told the chef the problem and received a dish of soy sauce, which did not make it taste better at all.  I'm not sure if the chef actually tasted that broth because if he did, he would know it was absolutely unacceptable. The three stars go toward the noodle soup that I got, rather pho.  It tasted more like a hybrid of ramen and pho and I appreciated the quality ingredients and the chef's rendition of the vietnamese beef ball. Truthfully though, I'd rather go to Saigon noodle or nam's for pho.  The service was great (we sat at the noodle bar). Although they were busy and it took a little while for our waiter to get to us, I find the service to be on point and pleasant. I would like to come back and see what else Sujeo has to offer (and hopefully give a better review), but I think I will be avoiding the ramen in the future"}
{"text":"Got dinner here with a group of friends, 5 people got the chicken or pork belly ramen. This restaurant needs to improve their ramen. Everyone needed to add salt to the weak and flavorless broth. The egg had no flavor, and the pork belly was very tough and also flavorless. The hot sauce on the table was very weak, and soy sauce is only available upon request. I believe there are some good menu items here, but definitely skip the ramen if you come here!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations going in since Chef Tory Miller is at the helm. Was disappointed  from what I got. The pork and shrimp potstickers were pretty good, but my entrees weren't that great. I went with the chili crab which was very unsatisfying especially at the market price for $32...for half a crab. The presentation didn't make it very appetizing and the taste was bland. You should probably stay away from the pork tonkatsu because it's just a deep fried pork cutlet served with rice. Oh and it's $22. I will give this restaurant another try because sometimes a newly opened restaurant still has to get in a swing of things and I've only experience part of the menu. I hope my next visit will be better."}
{"text":"KBC and the bibimbop or bib' is worth the trip. Nice cocktail selection and soft serve too. Tory gets it."}
{"text":"While trying to order the server literally runs away. The Chef is on the phone for 15 solid minutes at the wait station. I've never had service as bad as this."}
{"text":"Good, but with a couple kinks that can be easily sorted out.    The food overall was solid.  We had the imperial rolls, kohlrabi salad, japchae, and some special with green beans, ground pork, and szechuan peppercorns.  The imperial rolls were basically nice egg rolls which you then wrap in lettuce & cilantro. They were good egg rolls.  The kohlrabi salad has a good mix of tangy & savory going on, lots of shredded carrot and daikon and heirloom cherry tomatoes.  Japchae is a cellophane noodle thing with basically steak and bacon and veggies in it.  Steak and bacon and noodles, yes please.   I really liked those green beans, whatever the name of that special was.  I forget.  Nothing was overwhelmingly spicy which is good if you're sharing dishes in a group, and they have hot sauce on the table if desired.    The bar menu has a good selection of perhaps slightly fussy drinks that do taste good.  They don't call the bartender a 'mixologist' so the drinks, I'd say somewhere between creative and pretentious. But I'm a little pretentious myself so I can't fault them there.  The drinks were good.  Dessert was frozen custard which is a bit incongruous with a bunch of Asian food, but they were at least sorta-Asian flavors like guava and tamarind-coconut-pineapple so not as weird as Asian+custard might sound on the surface.  It is a nice way to cool down your mouth after some spicy food, and hey we're in Wisconsin. The girls' night out at the table opposite ours watched very intently as our server brought our two cones out on this cool little cone serving tray.  My gf said their heads all moved in unison.   Some of the other reviewers have noted that it's inconsistent, but I spotted Chef Tory by the host stand at one point so I assume since he was in the house the kitchen was on point that night.  I can't speak for how things might be another night.    Service was attentive, and our server was very descriptive.  All the servers would run food out to the table, I'm assuming they just have whichever server happens to be near the kitchen when an order is up run the food.  It's kinda tough to balance how much information is worth sharing when you're describing food in a chef-y place, some people want to know was the pig their pork came from well rested and given lots of blankets to sit on and sung lullabys at night, and not everybody is going to know what all these ingredients are.  All of our food was very thoroughly described.   Also, the girl who brought us out our noodley thing then said, \"oh, I need to get the scissors for this.\" My gf and I looked at each other like, \"wait did she just say scissors?\" The server returned to our table with a pair of kitchen shears in a carrying case back and proceeded to cut up our noodles for us, with scissors.  \"These noodles start out over 40 feet long,\" she said, and then returned the scissors to their case and walked away.   If I were to criticize, there are 3 things worth pointing out. Some of them are entirely fixable.    1. We parked in the garage under the apartment building. The kitchen exhaust vents into the garage. There's a good amount of greasy smoke coming out that exhaust. When we pulled in we could smell it in the car and thought 'SMELLS GOOD' but the path from our car to the building entrance led us to walk directly through this smoke cloud. Not pleasant.   2. The entrance from the lobby of the building goes to what I assume is the main dining room.  Where's the noodle bar and how do you get there?  Is that a separate room with a separate entrance?  It wasn't readily apparent and if the noodle bar is a separate space, maybe the hosts should ask if people want the dining room or noodle bar?   3. The only utensils you get are shiny metal chopsticks and these weird spoons that are long like ice cream sundae spoons but kinda wider and flatter like soup spoons.  Shiny polished metal chopsticks don't give you as good of a grip on the food as bamboo chopsticks.  I'm good with chopsticks and these were a bit of a challenge.  The only other option is to use the chopsticks and push food onto your extra-long soup/sundae spoon and shovel it in to your mouth with that, but then you look like a dork, because who eats with an extra-long soup/sundae spoon thingie?"}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting it to lean more traditional with the Korean cuisine, but I was slightly disappointed with my meal. Don't get me wrong, it was still solid food, it just didn't have as much of the bold Korean flavors that I would have liked.   The portion sizes of the chili-braised eggplant and the ddeokbokki were surprisingly small, which was disappointing.     Things to check out: the bibimbap and the cocktails! Although I didn't select this dish, my fiancee LOVED the General Tso chicken livers. He kept raving about it days afterwards."}
{"text":"I've been back to Sujeo twice since my first visit, and it just fails to wow me.  They no longer offer dim sum, which is too bad, because it had the possibility to be great despite the somewhat lackluster start.    From their current menu, the chicken skin bao is my favorite, and the cheesy ddeokbokki is unusual and good.  The staff is generally friendly and well trained, though there have been hiccups here and there.  There's good energy sitting at the noodle bar, but the shio ramen I tried was low-on flavor (the soft boiled egg was by far the best part, and it was outstanding)."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was not worth it. Hostess had no idea what she was doing.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Graze (their sister establishment ) but I do not love Sujeo. It seemed to me that Sujeo is trying too hard in crafting their menu. There are some dishes on their menu like general tso chicken liver that do not 'fuse' perfectly. My first visit wasn't pleasant either. I ordered a bowl of seafood noodles and 3 out of the few mussels/clams were closed! Even though I am not a chef I know that closed mussels/clams are dead and you do not serve them to paying customers."}
{"text":"Solid food and cocktails all around - we sampled a bit of everything (noodles, hot pot, greens) as a party of 4. Excellent service on a busy Saturday night as well. There are lots of daily specials but so many it might make sense for the restaurant to print them out as it took our waitress about 4 minutes to explain them all. And it can be noisy so it can be hard to hear everything.  We found the atmosphere to be a little spartan and underwhelming however. But we did score one of the corner 4-tops which made our dining experience a bit cozier."}
{"text":"My friend has been raving about Sujeo for six months but I didn't have the opportunity to stop in until two weeks ago.  We were getting together for a play and we told our wait staff this at the start.  She was very helpful about leading us to items that would not delay us.  We opted for three sharable plates:  Fried Brussels Sprouts & Kale, Cheesy Ddeokbokki, and Squash Curry.  The Brussels sprouts plate was my favorite of the night.  The veggies were fried crisp and the flavors were so SO so good.  There was crispy shallots sprinkled in and on this dish that just added the perfect taste.  The Cheesy Ddeokbokki was the most interesting dish of the night.  Thin strips of rice cakes were coated in a red sauce with a bit of a spicy bit of kimchi.  The rice cake was like a gnocchi in texture.  I don't know if I would eat this dish by myself but I would share it again.  The Squash Curry had this very fresh vegetable taste.  It should it's full of squash, eggplant, tomatoes, and snow peas.  It was very flavorful and delicious.    For drinks, the menu has a lot of interesting choices.  I opted for the Painkiller.  It is rum, orange and pineapple juices.  It was tasty but it is sweet.  I changed to water afterwards just to give myself a break.  My friend ordered a white wine and enjoyed it.  I hope to come to this location again and try more items.  The service was very good and the food items were outstanding."}
{"text":"Well I really love Sujeo's food. I love their ramen, especially the Shio Ramen, and Cheesy Ddeokbokki is also so so tasty.   But I've been there three times and the second two times, I got violently ill immediately afterward. I don't think it was food poisoning - I shared the meals with my boo, and he was fine - but it's not something I can overlook. I don't know if it was caused by secret ingredients I'm allergic to (nuts), or what.   Still, sometimes I suggest to my bb that we go there and he has to gently pat my head and tell me, no, that's not a good idea."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised by how low Sujeo was rated. I'm a big fan of Tory Miller and all of his restaurants so I was naturally very excited to finally get over to Sujeo.   This was my second time there and I have been very pleased both times. They have great specials and options for two people to splits so it's great for date night. I do wish that some of those options were available in single entree options as I feel like i would never be able to agree with my dining partners.   But the real reason I came on here was to rave about their Bibimbap. MY. GOD. I am always so thankful that their portions are so large that I have left overs to relive and bask in its glory. The steak and the spicy pork were great but I was happy that I had ordered the spicy pork for myself.   As a student I am always conscious of what I am spending and there are times when I cringe when I get the check after eating thinking that it wasn't work it. Tory Miller does killer food and accordingly can have you pay for it. I was not at all unhappy with paying 25ish dollars for their Bibimbap and a drink, it was great food and a lot of it."}
{"text":"In summary: The group dishes I tried were a bit disappointing, and I felt the price was a bit inflated as well. Still, I think the noodle dishes have potential.  Ssam: Serves two, meat of the day with banchan, lettuce wraps, rice , ssamjang (spicy sauce).  To serve this dish, the server brought a butane stove, stone bowl, and several banchan dishes.  I was very disappointed at the actual contents of the bowl, the meats.  From my understanding, ssam is traditionally served with a roasted or grilled meat.  The beef ribs in our dish were served in broth.  A brothy stew is not ideal for a meat you're planning to wrap in lettuce or buns, and there wasn't much flavor--pretty much seemed like the beef was boiled in the meat.  A glazed meat dish kept warm in the stone bowl would have been much better.  Furthermore, as we were halfway through the ssam, the server informed us that the chef recommended ordering a side of ramen noodles that would be cooked in the leftover broth.  It was a good suggestion, but at the wrong time; we had already made our orders, not knowing that it was an option.  Fried chicken: Korean fried chicken typically has a thin, crisp skin unlike American style fried chicken which has a thicker breaded crust. I really enjoyed the chicken, which was also served with a variety of banchan, but I did feel that $28 for 4 fried chicken pieces is excessive.  Banchan featured kimchi, pickled radishes, pickled zucchini (not sure), macaroni salad, some sort of tasty root, donut peaches, and dipping sauces. In particular, the spicy sauces were excellent.  Reminded me a bit of a BBQ sauce; in particular I appreciate the hot sauce with sesame sauce served with the Ssam.  The banchan was challenging to my palate as I'm usually not a pickle person, but the variety was intriguing and I particularly like the black root thing.  Beef tongue salad: Really enjoyed this dish featuring thin slices of cold beef with onion, rice powder, spices, and cilantro.  A little heavy on the salt.  Japchae: cold noodle salad with veggies, meat, some chili, sweet soy sauce dressing.  Good!  A dish that I would order again.  You can add hot sauce if you like it more spicy.  Reminds me a wee bit of Viet bún bò xào (cold rice noodle salad w/ beef)  Miscellaneous:  The Shipwrecked cocktail tastes like curry in a good way due to the presence of galangal and lemongrass. The pineapple custard was a steal at $3 per cone.   Restaurant interior: the restaurant needs more signage, which I'm guessing is coming soon.  There are 2 entrances, but 1 entrance is mostly for the noodle bar when the main restaurant is closed.  At the noodle bar, you have a more limited menu (mostly noodles!) and part of it has a good view of the kitchen.  At the main restaurant, they are not currently doing reservations but you can be put on a waitlist and they will text you when your table is ready.  A small bar (seats about 6 people) is also available.  I hope they add more lighting to the hallway to the restrooms, as the area has no lighting.  Miscellaneous comments: estaurant is ADA accessible and not particularly kid oriented, you can park on the street or in the short term parking at the Constellation.  Overall, I am inclined to try again but I will get a noodle dish instead as I think there is potential."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Having previously lived in the Constellation and had this restaurant very accessible, I might be a little biased.   What I've loved: the bibimbap (got it with foie gras as a special OMG!!), KBC, General Tso Chicken Livers (sweetbreads), Khao Soi (still some of the best I've had), and any noodle bar special they've had!!! Seriously. They come up with the most original and interesting flavor combinations. Still dreaming about the Cheeseburger ramen with onion broth. Do yourself a favor and follow sujeo on IG so you can stop in and get one of these original soups that would blow up in any other city.   If you were lucky to catch their dim sum brunch with the carts that they offered for a short time it was one of the best deals in town. $5 for servings of dumplings, short ribs, and chicken feet. Hopefully they bring it back at some point."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time tonight. The waiter was very excited and enthusiastic about the food, which made me very hopeful about the food! My companion and I ordered the Saäm, which was a New York strip. The meat was delicious, but it was a bad cut - really gristly, which isn't ideal with chopsticks and no way to cut off the bad bits. The waiter, when informed, brought kitchen scissors over to the table and poked through the meat in front of us, one-handed and clumsy. For a $70 meal for both of us, I was really disappointed. I had high hopes, but I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Great service - delicious food! The Brussel sprouts and were to die for!  I'm a new regular !"}
{"text":"Do not come here for lunch or Dim-Sum. There are some serious kinks that need to be worked out. I really wanted Suejo to get Dim-Sum right; Madison is in some serious need for a good dim-sum place.   There is really nothing positive to say about dim-sum service, it is slow if just non-existent. I was there for a 3nd time on Saturday (2nd for dim sum) hoping that in the few months when I first went some of the problems had been figured out. However I was wrong, the carts rarely come around and if they do there are only 3-5 bamboo steamers on the cart and by the time they get to you all the food is gone and you wont see another cart for 20 min.   If and when you do get a dish off a dim-sum cart it is usually cold. The kitchen is obvously rushing to get food out at the expense of quality. All the dumplings and bao are way too doughy. The soup dumplings are atrocious, way too much dough barely enough soup or meat. I could barely swallow one. Har gow (shrimp dumplings) are also too doughy. They were also out of 3 dishes when we went this time including the ribs which is one of the other dishes that is actually good. How can they be out of 3 dishes on a Saturday? Don't they have dim sum service on Sundays too?  I feel bad for the waitstaff; there is obviously something going on in the kitchen and that is putting the front staff is a tough position. But front staff was not much better. A table of five sitting behind us complained and our waitress rushed the kitchen and brought them out several bamboo steamers and 2 bowls of lumpia rolls. I get that she wanted to make her table happy but what about the other tables? Several table around us also seemed annoyed and one asked for their bill of drinks and said they were leaving. It was pretty ridiculous. Our waitress never apologized and very rarely checked on us. We had to flag her down for our check and for her to take it.  They also had 2 hostesses and a water person but not sure exactly what they were doing.   I would only ever come back for their dinner service, maybe sit at their bar. The drinks are good and the other food we have tried is pretty delicious too. The KBC and dan dan noodles were good. We had a grilled shrimp appitizer one night that was pretty good. But none of the other food has blown me out of the water and bad service is just something I cannot get over that easily. The disappointing dim sum food and service makes me not want to risk dinner here anytime soon. Being a fan of Tori Millers other restaurants and his food makes me very disappointed for my experiences at Suejo. We will stick to Dumpling House and Asian Sweet Bakery for great tasting dishes and good service."}
{"text":"Such a great dinner at Sujeo tonight.  I have driven past many times and finally had the opportunity to stop in.  I was welcomed immediately by a server and was the only one to sit at the bar.  The bar manager was awesome and explained all of my happy hour options as well as their nice drink menu.    He was so thorough with explaining the dinner menu as well!  He suggested the chicken skin bao which is something I probably wouldn't have ordered if he didn't say it was a must.  I was not disappointed!  So awesome, texture and flavor sensation.  Loved that the sauce was messy, so worth it.  I had the glass sweet potato noodle dish for my main.  The server who brought it out offered to cut up my noodles with a scissors, another huge win.  Delicious noodles.  Looking forward to my next visit!  Thank you Sujeo, well done.  PS there's a pretty awesome fire breathing surprise in the bathroom"}
{"text":"Great experience!! Fast service, clean, located right next to festival foods.  We ordered fried calamari - with spicy sauce, pork ribs with Korean bbq sauce, and pork dumplings. Now first about the good stuff! Loved the fried calamari and pork ribs very well made and appropriate spice/hotness level. I would suggest for people who cannot handle spicy  food to not order this dish as the heat might be a little over powering for the palette. The dumplings were no big deal, the outer dough of the dumpling was very thick and the pork fell right out of the dumpling when I tried to eat it. Those dumplings stickers could be make a thinner. The pork ribs were my favorite, i recently checked the menu again and found out that they don't have those ribs on their menu anymore, I hope they get it back soon! Will definitely recommend this place, can't wait to try their new menu items! Will update my review after my next visit."}
{"text":"Sujeo was at most mediocre. I'll start with the good parts. The location is decent and the restaurant itself is stylish and trendy looking. The wait staff are extremely nice.  Originally, I had thought this was a Korean food only place, but turns out it has other Asian cuisine as well, about which I still don't know how I feel.   We started off with the Honey Butter Chips because it sounded really unique. Sadly, we got a tiny bowl drenched in honey butter. The chips tasted like Lays. Because of the salt on the chips, it made the honey butter intolerably sweet. It was $4 for maybe 12 chips.  Next, we ordered the Kimchi Jigae. It came as a side, which was weird to me since it's normally a full entree at Korean restaurants. It was very watery.  For my entree, I got the Pastrami Pho. I shouldn't have expected something similar to authentic pho. The pastrami was a very odd touch. It was like pieces of pastrami, not very appetizing. The noodles to soup ratio was very off - too much noodles and way too little soup."}
{"text":"We recently went to Graze located up in the Capital Square and saw they also own Sujeo, so we decided to give it a try.   We ordered the fried egg roll to share. When it came, it was the largest egg roll I have ever seen. It reminded me of a chimichanga. The server cut it in half for the two of us to share. It had a pretty good flavor with little shrimp and the ground pork. I was expecting the bbq pork but it was fine.   For my main course I ordered the Miso Ramen. It looked beautiful in the bowl but upon trying the dish it lacked flavor. The chicken was in the dry side with very little flavor. The broth did not have the miso flavor or even chicken broth flavor. I had to ask for some soy sauce to help flavor the dish.   For a drink I ordered a Mai Tai. It was so incredibly strong. I mean I got my money's worth of alcohol and then some. Whew!  Service was good. No complaints there.    Overall, we do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"When esteemed chef Tory Miller announced the opening of his latest culinary installment about a year ago, locals knew the restaurant would be a hit. Regardless of the anticipated cuisine, the fact that Miller would be the brains behind the operation assured success from the start. Chef Miller has demonstrated his expertise as chef of the respected L'Etoile and Graze, both highly regarded locally and on a national scale. It was with this impressive background that Miller set off in the works of Sujeo. It's no wonder there's been so much buzz surrounding his latest work.  The locally-inspired menu features an assortment of egg rolls, spring rolls, and imperial rolls, all of which showcase fresh ingredients of grilled pork, shrimp, herbs, and various vegetables. These particular items serve as a few of the flavor-packed appetizers to the remaining rice, noodle, and ssäm dishes that make up the main portion of the menu.   Another popular option is Hot Pot, which consists of cooking meat and vegetables in a simmering pot of stock at the center of the table. The dish will prove a feast for two adventurous eaters, and with each subsequent visit this menu item will never bore considering the selection varies daily. Seeing as not many restaurants in Madison offer this interactive eating method, Sujeo raises the bar in terms of innovative dining.   As far as rice dishes, diners can expect everything from bibimbap and General Tso chicken livers, to a Singaporean chili crab and hearty mango curry. All of the items showcase the restaurant's emphasis on embracing the cuisines of multiple ethnicities and present twists on traditional dishes with the fusion of ingredients from various Asian-style cuisines.   The noodle entrees on the menu meld a multitude of cultures in a similar fashion. While each of these dishes are centered on noodles, there is an impressive range in the type of noodle offered. Some entrees feature whole-wheat noodles, while other dishes utilize rice vermicelli and wonton. The Dan Dan is composed of udon noodles with ground pork, spicy peanut sauce and Sichuan chili oil, while the Japchae features a combination of sweet potato glass noodles, marinated steak, bell peppers, bacon, spinach, mushrooms, sweet soy sauce, and sesame.   This last Japchae dish, which I was able to sample in my recent visit to Sujeo, was fascinating. As the Japchae plate arrived to the table, the server came bearing a long pair of kitchen shears, which he used to cut the long glass noodles into more manageable portions. He explained that the cooking method requires the noodles stay long, but when it comes to indulge in the dish, the noodles are easier to eat once cut to a smaller size. Overall, the dish was well balanced with sweet components from the peppers and sauce, as well as the more savory addition that the bacon and marinated steak contributed. My only complaint would be the scarcity of steak throughout this largely noodle based dish. If it's meat that you seek, then you best look elsewhere.   As a whole, Sujeo presents creative representations of classic Asian-style dishes. While the food does stray from traditional, the items are well executed and demonstrate Chef Miller's culinary ingenuity in a way that gives credibility to his wide acclaim.   I'll definitely be back to try the custard, which I sadly forgot they offered when I was there, as well as the curry entrees and spring rolls. nomnom"}
{"text":"Update: For dietary specifications ask for their other menu with specifications. They have a menu that says what all they can turn vegetarian or vegan or you can simply ask the staff, they were very patient about explaining and finding out from the kitchen. Our complete order was vegetarian and the waiter was kind and patiently made a couple of trips into the kitchen to confirm all out dietary specific questions.  Sujeo won a vote for trying Korean food over Sol's on the Square. I won't compare them yet (I haven't eaten at Sol's so far). We were very excited about trying Korean food here after reading all the reviews on Yelp and Google.  What we ordered: Chili-Braised Eggplant - 5/5 Star of the night. Both eggplant and tofu were really fresh and tender! And the sauce brought out the best taste in them! They just melted away the minute I took a bite. Banchan - 3.5/5 I liked the kimchi soup, cabbage kimchi, daikon radish and cucumber kimchi. I don't remember the rest and I didn't like them anyway. Japchae - 4/5 Very fresh tofu and loved the smokey taste to the dish. Bibimbap - 3.5/5 I loved the presentation and the way it cooked in itself. Taste... Meh... I had to keep mixing it so that the rice wouldn't get too crispy or burnt out because of the heat from the stone bowl.  The food quality was really really good but probably because I ate too much of the appetizers I couldn't really enjoy the Bibimbap. Even so, for me it wasn't feasible to keep mixing the Bibimbap because the rice will get too crispy...  Service: The staff was friendly and we were seated almost as soon as we got there. 4/5  Price: Expected what we would pay. $$  Overall I will give it 3.5/5. A good place to go just once or twice."}
{"text":"If you like pork and salt this is the place for you however, not being a pork eater ( and pork is in virtually every dish) i found the menu very limiting.   I managed to get a beef dish minus the bacon. I found it to be very salt laced ( almost too salty to be edible) as far as any other flavor development - it was non existent - what i tasted was salty beef with noodles. Pretty gosh darn awful - had i cooked this at home it would have gone in the trash.   Now for the service -my waitress was very put off when i mentioned that everything had pork and she avoided our table after this like the plague. Like we were lepurs. Had she asked me how my food was i would have told her to taste it herself and answer that question in her head.   Thus bad service over salted food limited menue i could go on but why bother with words on a place i will not go to and steer friends clear of .   Not a good effort by a chef known to be one of the best in town - Sugeo - Does that mean dissapointing in Korean? I think so"}
{"text":"I've been excited to try Tory Millers newest restaurant since it opened and finally made it there recently.  It was a Friday night and we only had about a 40 minute wait which was just the right amount of time to mingle with friends in the bar before grabbing a table.  Our server was fantastic and very helpful with educating us on the menu and what to order.  The eggrolls were to die for and the best we have ever had, but the eggplant appetizer was a little lackluster.  The General Tso chicken livers were outstanding and I'm still craving the Khao Soi!  Arguably my new favorite ethnic restaurant in Madison!    The restaurant last a star for its underwhelming interior and overly bright dining room and crammed bar area...but go for the food and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When a friend recommended this place I wanted to suggest somewhere else right off the bat - but, she was in town visiting from out of state and had heard about this place somehow so I figured I had better just agree, since this isn't somewhere she can come to anytime. I was nervous I wouldn't find anything on the menu that I liked and I didn't know what to expect.   Well, I was definitely able to find plenty of delicious food and drink, and overall I was very satisfied with this place!   We ordered the Brussels spouts to start. They were SO GOOD! I ordered the Miso Ramen. I was very pleased with the flavor fullness of this dish. I don't do mushrooms so I asked for it without and that was no problem. I would order this again for sure, it was delicious! My friends ordered the Dan Dan and Khai Soi. The Dan Dan was very good! Nice rich flavor. I love a good peanut sauce. I didn't try the Khao Soi as I am not keen on super spicy things, but my friend who ordered it said it was great.   We also ordered some specialty cocktails that were all delicious and very pretty! I went with the Pineapple Express Mail. Dangerously delicious!"}
{"text":"A unique gem.  The food is awesome.  The bibimbap is hard not to order.   The flavors all pop.  This place could hold its own with force in Downtown Chicago.  Serious consistent, well done gastronomic ethnic foodie experience.  (Not a great place for a bland Midwestern palette.) Excellent service.  The drinks are awesome.    My only critique is that the booths on the noodle bar side get somewhat cold during winter."}
{"text":"Decided to give Sujeo another try last week for my father's birthday.  Our first experience there was rocky, however that was shortly after the restaurant opened so we wanted to give it another try.  What a difference!  The service was excellent, with a very attentive waiter who truly knew the menu and gave great recommendations.  The dishes were all delicious and the portions were quite generous.  Bonus tip.... Sunday nights they have $5 cocktails and they are yummy!  The noodle bar is a very cool feature of the restaurant and it's hard not to like a restaurant that has such a clean and modern design.  I'm so glad to see that they worked out the service issues and have turned into a unique and delicious addition to Madison's restaurant choices."}
