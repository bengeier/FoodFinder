{"text":"Celebrated friend's birthday on a Sunday night. This time the restaurant is packed. So please do reserve your table during weekend. 
Everything is so good as the first time. Remember to try their lobster risotto. The best risotto in town!"}
{"text":"Positives:
- delicious pizza, thin crust with quality fresh ingredients.
- great ambience; definitely a classy joint
- they give you lots of booze in their cocktails (at least that's the case in the Long Island iced tea that I'd ordered)

Negative:
Really only one negative here. I've had their seafood risotto (Risotto alla Pescatore) twice on two separate occasions, and both time the lobster was not fresh.  When you bite into the lobster meat, it's mushy, not springy as would be the case for fresh lobsters.  Other ingredients in the dish were fresh and delicious.

I would come back for their pizza and try other dishes.  But no seafood risotto for me."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday evening. I like the place is not too crowded so we had some nice conversions. The place is nicely decorated.

Service is beyond expectation. 14 years of business speaks its words. My steak is a little overcooked than what I have ordered. My server noticed it and insist to change it without me saying anything. He also knows the menu very well that he recommended the signature dishes and wine to us

Recommended. Will for sure come back again"}
{"text":"Zafferno is such a lovely restaurant! The dining room is warm & charming, the staff is kind & attentive, and the food is simply delicious!

The gnocchi was possibly the best I have ever had! (And I have had a lot of gnocchi over the years in Canada, the states, & Italy).

Simple dishes with fresh, tasty ingredients. Wonderful balance of flavors & attention to detail. The little things - the espresso, the olive oil - were terrific.

Sweet staff. Warm, welcoming, attentive & entertaining."}
{"text":"We hosted a family event here and the service and food was impeccable. One of the best experiences we've ever had at a restaurant. Mike was amazing to work with, world-class. He made booking the reservation turn-key. The food was amazing! Top notch. The veal chop is to die for. Totally recommend for family function."}
{"text":"We were craving Italian food last Friday and my partner's coworker (who lives in Woodbridge) recommended Zafferano.  From the outside, it looks a bit like a restaurant that moved into a small strip mall grocery store space.  Fortunately, the outside is totally misleading.

The clientele is a mix of young and old, couples, families, groups of friends.  We were seated quickly and felt welcomed.  The servers are professional, friendly and fast.  

We ordered a half bottle of red from a fairly extensive menu, and ordered the avocado salad as an appetizer.  The salad was good, it started bland but as we really mixed the ingredients together it became quite tasty.  We'll aim for the arancini or calamari next time.  My partner had the seafood linguine and I had the pappardelle with shrimp in a rose saffron sauce.  Both pasta dishes were outstanding.  The pappardelle dish was very rich, which I assumed it would be when I ordered it, and I felt like taking a nap halfway through.  But only the best kind of nap, like after you just indulged in beautiful comfort food.  

The seafood linguini was perfect.  There was half a crab leg split lengthwise on top of the dish, cooked and seasoned to perfection.  After working through the generous amount of crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams, there was another half leg of crab at the bottom, brimming with sauce and flavour.  So good!  They make all of their pasta in-house and it shows.  Toothsome, tasty and cooked perfectly.  The pappardelle was particularly excellent, possibly the best I've had.  It was ripped at various lengths and carried the rose sauce beautifully.

We didn't have room for dessert and coffee but the desserts we spied being served at other tables looked incredible.  Next time, we'll go with bigger appetites and really dig in.  The prices are pretty much exactly what they should be - an affordable, authentic, satisfying and delicious Italian dinner.  A return is definitely in order!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian cooking and reasonably priced.  The waiters always seem to have a good sense of humour."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  The service was fast but not too fast where you feel they're rushing you out, and the food was so fresh and delicious!  I had the Spinach salad to start and my husband had a Cesar salad.  The salads are huge, so one would have been enough for both of us.  They were so fresh and the dressing on each of them was just right.  Not overly garlicky or overly seasoned... just right. 

We also tried the Italian Style Egg Rolls and they were fabulous.  Again, all of the ingredients were so fresh.  Initially we wanted to try the Burrata, but the server said they were out.  (due to seasonality)

My husband then ordered the Bistecca Zafferano and I had the Stuffed Gnocchi.  The steak was cooked perfectly and came on a bed of saffron risotto.  Delicious.  Initially my pasta didn't look like that much, but once you started eating it, you realize that it was portioned perfectly.  It was the best gnocchi I've had in North America (and besides my nonna's!)  

For dessert, my husband loved his carrot cake infused cheesecake and I had the molten lava cake.  My cake was excellent, however it was very rich.  The desserts are HUGE, so you only need one per couple.

The table next to us ordered a pizza and it looked amazing also.  We will definitely go back!  Make a reservation.... it gets really busy!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant at recommendation from an Italian co worker. I'm really happy I was introduced to this place. I haven't had such delicious Italian food in a long time. It's better than a lot of establishments downtown. 
The table bread was really fresh. 
We ordered:
-grilled calamari for app. The portion size was big and came with a side of salad. Great for sharing. Really fresh and nicely done. 12$
-seafood risotto was piled high with fresh shrimp, clams, mussels and a full size lobster half with the claws. (the real deal!)
Risotto was cooked to al dente. Delicious!
For 24$ that's a great deal.
-papradelle pasta with shrimp and oyster mushroom in a cognac rose sauce (19$). Also cooked to al dente. I ordered this dish and loved it. Really flavorful and tasty. One of the best pasta dishes I've had.
Zafferano is so yummy I'm already thinking about going back for my birthday next month!
Service was great, friendly and approachable. Not pretentious at all.
Atmosphere is classic Italian, great for dates and celebrations.
Go on and give them a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went for a luncheon for my nephew's confirmation and the food was fresh, outstanding. The best Italian food in Toronto, it is even \"nonna\" approved."}
{"text":"Over priced and slow service. So many other restaurants in Woodbridge will give you a better experience."}
{"text":"A four star instead of 5 for a couple of reasons:
1) I was disappointed with our Burrata appetizer (which is imported from Italy) for $22. It had a slight off putting taste... I can't out my finger on it... Kind of an oyster smell to it which doesn't seem right altogether. 
2) I find their dessert menu extremely disappointing. Out of an extensive dessert menu, only 2 of the dishes are actually made in house. Majority of the desserts are NOT Italian. They don't even have gelato - only vanilla and chocolate ice cream! I wish they would just cut it down and offer a few authentic Italian desserts that they actually make! My friend ordered the chocolate molten lava cake and was unimpressed. 

Onto the good! The pasta is made fresh in house and all the dishes we got were amazing! Hugely recommended for pasta. Al dente, great flavour and a vast selection. I got the special which was an olive infused pasta with seafood and a tomato based sauce. Delectable. Absolutely loved my two friends' dishes as well... Absolutely worth a re-order:

Pappardelle Zafferano
(Wide cut egg noodles in a sauce of diced tomatoes, shrimps, oyster mushrooms in a cognac, saffron rose sauce) 

Fettuccine al tartufo (Homemade fettucini with shitake, oyster and porcini mushrooms all tossed in a black truffle and garlic infused olive oil sauce) 

Great ambiance and great service. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Zafferano offers an adequate selection of dishes and well prepared. A group of us have been going a couple of times a year and are not returning for  couple of reasons.  The first being the loudness of the place in various corners of the restaurant, making having a conversation very difficult. The second reason is that I was charged $10.00 more than other entrees at the table which contained Pasta and rice, meats and/or seafood. I am a vegetarian and do not grains either.  My entree consisted of two mushrooms, three asparagus, two slices of eggplant and three slices of peppers!!"}
{"text":"Zafferano is fantastic. The restaurant is warm and inviting. The food is phenomenal. And Yamplier (JP) is the single best waiter I've ever met. Seriously, JP is an incredibly genuine guy and makes you feel like part of the family. We'd come back just to hang out with him again."}
{"text":"Went for a meal with 6 people. Although we had to wait for everyone to arrive the waiter did bring water to the table. We ordered our meals: salads and fried calamari for starters. The calamari was heavenly, the salads looked really good too. I ordered wine. It took a bit long to arrive, but we weren't in any rush so the slow service was not a big deal. Our main courses were salmon, stuffed gnocchi, and steaks. The steaks were really beautifully done. Fantastic presentation. The gnocchi was delicious and the salmon was good too. We rounded the meal out with tartufo which were absolutely wonderful and coffees. The atmosphere was fun, happy and relaxed. We were very satisfied with our meal and service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very nice wine selection. I enjoyed the lamb , scallop , salmon and white fish. Pasta was also wonderful. I look forward to my next dining experience."}
{"text":"The guys on my project took us all out to dinner for a successful go live. It has been a long time since I had Italian food this good. Located in a small strip mall next to Quasimodo's (Quizno's) this little gem pulls you right into the middle of a classic Italian restaurant. 

There were 7 of for dinner and we all were satisfied and full. We ordered the anti pasta for 7. All the standards but they were all marinated, roasted and seasoned to perfection. The Bridgetta was perfect and the bread, crunchy with a wheat flower texture and soft in the middle. Added the olive oil, balsamic vinegar with a touch of hot pepper sauce and it is what my grandfather called....\"That's living\". 

Dinner was a tenderloin cooked to perfection with baby carrots, broccoli rabe and roasted potato's. Add a dill sauce and a balsamic reduction and the flavors melted into the beef. 

The service was classic Europe. We owned the table for the evening. Our server worked knew when to come over and when to not. Bottled water, Stella and red wine. 

Desert was a personal favorite a creme Berle. Perfection. What I loved the most was the laid back atmosphere. They are building an extension on the side and I believe it is an outdoor cafe area. 

This place in top notch. Go there and enjoy it. This is a rare gem!"}
{"text":"Zafferano fell short of my expectations. I have been to their other restaurant Sapore quite a few times and enjoy the food there very much, but at Zafferano, I found that the Avocado Salad was quite overpriced for what was given (4 leaves of radicchio, 3 slices of avocado, and a sprinkling of tomato and cucmber) and the margherita pizza salty. The service also fell short, we waited a long time for one of my friends' meals to arrive and when it did, it was incorrect, and there was no apology made for the mix-up. I have definitely experienced better. Sorry!"}
{"text":"we went out for a family dinner. We (my family) are all Italian and know what good Italian food is...THe bread was fresh, had mussels, fried calamari and a appetizer platter for the table..Excellent and tradional,,,the only thing that wasn't was the  chipolte dipping sauce for the calamari, unique, not too spicy and good..WE had pastas, lamb, rib steak (with wine reduction) everything looked, smelt and tasted good because it was all gone by the end of the night. the deserts were good...The only negative a little too pricey for the type of restaurant it is, its a 3.5 star out of 5 but the rates are of a 4.5 star...service and food were good, not rushed, will definetly try it again...."}
{"text":"If anyone dines or lives in the Woodbridge area you know that Italian restaurants are on every corner and its very rare that any of them are not good.  Booking any restaurant in the Woodbridge area on a Saturday night needs a reservation well in advance.  Well Zafferano is one of those restaurants that has been around for many years and I will call it one of the originals.  I had been to Zafferano many many times before I became a Yelper but haven't been in a very long time.  I booked reservations to visit with some friends and when we arrived the place was just super packed.  Thank god for the reservation because people were being turned down at the door.  We were seated fairly quickly.  My first impression was that it was super loud.  I was having one hell of a time hearing my friends.  There was not too much conversation going around the table that evening.  None the less I am here for the food.  We ordered some apps for the table to share.  The fried calamari were average, crispy and tasty.  The antipasto platter was amazing.  Considering not much had to be cooked it took a very long time for the apps to come out which made it seem longer because I could barely speak with my friends.  For the main dish I ordered the penne a la vodka.  Again took more than an hour to get our entree's.  When it did arrive it was great.  Pasta was eldente as it should be sauce had the right amount of panchetta.  Over all a good dish.  One thing I learned from my visit was to attend Zafferano on a day its less busy or just go alone so you don't have to talk to anyone.  

Great Food - Great Service - Took forever to get food"}
{"text":"The best seafood!!

We went here for a work party and tried the calamari, Zuppa di pesce, lobster risotto. 

Every single dish was amazing for taste and flavour/ portion size.  Prices were higher but this was the best quality and worth it. 

The Zuppa dish was my favourite. I haven't had something taste that good since Europe. 


I will want to do back for a date night. 

10/10 

Amazing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 4 - made a phone reservation for a wrong time, but was seated immediately anyway.

Food- 4/5. I ordered the grilled calamari with salad (pescatarian) as the appetizer, which was amazing and worth every dollar ($14-15?). It was a pretty decent size - tbh I was getting full after this dish. The calamari was large size and well-seasoned with balsamic vinaigrette plus possibly olive oil and the salad, which had greens and some roasted veggies and olives, came pre-dressed. The polenta (has meat!) appetizer was so-so, only had 3 pieces, but the figs were a nice touch. The puff pastry (vegetarian) appetizer, which also came with a salad, was the only disappointing dish, with only 2 pastries, which were not very puffy but heavy on the cheese.

The mains were all huge portions, but too salty! I've been downing water all night yikes. The pasta (1 of the only vegetarian options), the cheapest option, was surprisingly small and plain, but quite heavy with 3 cheeses and a creamy sauce. It didn't have that wow factor since the pasta didn't seem to be house-made and was pretty generic. The waiter strongly recommended the zuppa di pesce (pescatarian), which was enormous, came in a giant bowl of super salty white wine-based tomato sauce with 3 thick bread triangles and LOTS of seafood (mussels, clams, 3 crab legs, calamari, really tender jumbo shrimp, fish). Omg dying, so full. I would not recommend this dish if you can't tolerate salt or have a smaller appetite.

We didn't have room for dessert, but they had an extensive Italian dessert menu that looked good and ranged around $8-10.

Value- 4/5. Pastas were relatively cheap actually, being under $20. The seafood platters are more expensive, $36 for the pesce mirto as the most expensive. But the portions are HUGE, even for appetizers! The appetizers were probably even big enough for an entree for a smaller appetite. Our bill tonight for 4 adults came to $177 pre-tip. We did not order drinks.

Venue- 5/5. Romantic and classy with glass chandeliers, candles, and plenty of space between tables. Ironic and funny because the restaurant looks kind of ratchet and cheap on the outside. Does get pretty loud during main meal times since this restaurant is as family-friendly as date night appropriate. 

They have a separate space available for booking private events like birthday parties and work events.

Service- 2/5. Really liked our servers - they were very warm, polite, and fun, but service was sooooooooo disorganized and slow. We had to beg for water refills multiple times, which was forgotten about multiple times... My partner never got his tea and eventually had to cancel his order. We waited over 30 minutes for the bill to come and every time we asked a staff he/she would redirect us to another staff who was equally confused and delayed. 

Might come back someday, specifically to CARB-LOAD pre-marathon. Perhaps after the TTC station to Vaughan is completed."}
{"text":"Visited this Woodbridge restaurant located in a strip mall for the first time tonight. It's a large open space but the decor is warm and inviting. We were greeted and seated immediately. A server approached us right away and service throughout the evening was very attentive and professional. The menu is diverse and priced reasonably. The  portions are generous and the presentation beautiful. We both chose veal dishes and were  pleased with our choices from salad (orange and fennel) through dessert (tiramisu). 
I look forward to returning in the future to try the pasta!"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and tasted amazing although their customer service was lacking. Overall I would go back BUT I would order all my food at once as the servers don't visit the table often."}
{"text":"Pleasant to dine in. Very friendly service. Great wine selection. I had the veal chop for lunch and I enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Recently went here for my birthday with 4 other guests on a Friday evening after it was recommended to me by a friend.

I was always a bit wary of this place, having passed by it a few times, as it was in a strip mall and the big pink sign made it look like some sort of cheap East Side Mario's-type place, so needless to say I was concerned about taking friends and family there for a big dinner.

Man was I ever wrong.

Where to begin? The outside does no justice to the interior, it is surprisingly nice, great atmosphere. 

The service was the star of the show, our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable, and very friendly. There wasn't a glass of wine or water that wasn't filled immediately if it started getting low, they kept bring basket after basket of bread to accompany our dishes, and they offered great insight into the food, the specials, and what to expect from them.

Then the food came. Just fantastic, wow. Every appetizer, every entree, all just amazing. Especially my brother's steak, which was one of the biggest I've ever seen, and cooked to perfection. As someone who knows how to cook meat better than anyone I know, his endorsement of it as one of the best he's had spoke volumes, especially coming from a place known for it's pasta and pizza.

The shocker of the night came at the end however: the bill. We all did a double take and quickly began pouring over the bill, insisting that something must have been missed, there was no way it was that low.

No mistake. Hands down the best bang for your buck in the city, holy hell. I was floored by how reasonable the prices were.

I can't say enough about our experience, to say we will be back is an understatement. I'm now looking for reasons to take other people here..."}
{"text":"The food is good but not any better than any other premium Italian restaurant. And premium it is. Five of us ate for $400 with drinks and tip. Somewhat steep which would be okay if the meal was spectacular. That it wasn't."}
{"text":"Oh man....this is my new most favorite Italian place in this country! Wood fired pizza, Pasta, Meat Dishes, Fish Dinners, Antipasto, Appetizers, we have tried many different selections tonight in my group of three. We have way over indulged, but I'd like to call it enjoyed !! 
We started with antipasto platter, had some pizza and then their seafood pasta special with added chorizo sausage. Some pictures to follow. The flavors were unreal!! Every bite was a sensation of deliciousness. I'm very grateful my friend brought me here for the first time tonight (about as much as I am mad he didn't bring me by here sooner!! Haha) and I will be back for sure. 
I will most definitely recommend this place to everyone and call upon all fellow helpers to stop by here to confirm this place?? All in all, atmosphere, food, flavors and the people, one package you won't see again anytime soon, unless you come back here!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't found a decent Italian restaurant until I came here. I was here for a meeting, and even though the meeting wasn't very interesting, the restaurant more than made up for it.

The good:
Antipasto
Lots of food on the main course.
4 meats on one plate. Chicken, beef, pork, and salmon! Yum
Tirimasu desert was awesome

The bad:
Wine was ok, had much better. Was a bit too dry for me.
Antipasto had limited options, needed a bit more to it.

The ugly:
Overcooked steak. A steak done right is amazing, but this was baseball glove. 

Overall the restaurant was cooking for about 100 at the same time, so they did an amazing job. I think on a normal night this place would shine. I looked into the kitchen and it is really nice and clean. Beautiful. I would live to cook in it.

I definitely need to come here for a regular evening!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere of this restaurant - warm and welcoming. Great for a special lunch or dinner. Enjoyed the pasta - was cooked perfectly. I look forward to going back there soon!"}
{"text":"Very rude staff, i was shocked being a downtown girl who drove up for a family dinner. The staff seemed to think they were working in yorkville- reality check, you're off an industrial side street in Woodbridge. You're wearing cheap polyester vests on fake laminate floors. Don't give me attitude.

At the prices too I wish my parents had driven downtown- terronis or cibo would have been better food with way better service."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants we've been to in a very long time. We started with an antipasti plate for two which was a great starter combining meats, cheese, grilled zucchini and eggplant and their very own Italian egg rolls which were very tasty. My wife had the penne alla vodka and I had the pappardelle zafferano, both were simple and delicious. I couldn't get over how amazing the flavours were with the pappardelle when they seemed to only use olive oil, garlic and parm. We finished with the creme brûlée which was light and the perfect ending to a fantastic meal. The portions are large, we left stuffed and happy and looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Had Christmas staff party there last year. The antipasto selection was declicious! We could have just had those, entrees were all exceptional. 

I am only writing this a year late because we had our party this year somewhere else and we were very disappointed. Decided we will go back next year,"}
{"text":"SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS!  It's unfortunate that my wife and I never even had a chance to sample the food.  After standing uncomfortably in the reception area for five minutes and not having one of the MANY employees even acknowledge us, we left."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the Steak Zafferano. Let me start off by saying that the service here was extraordinary. We were seated and attended to very well, albeit perhaps due to our strategically early arrival (have to beat those peak lunch/dinner hours!).

Let's start off with the ambiance. This place is definitely a place meant for business and romance. Given that we came in the afternoon, there was ample lighting if you choose to sit near the windows, though there was also a section in the back which was not as brightly lit - so you could choose where you'd like to sit - either more secluded and dim or in the bright open.

Let's now move onto the food. I could only speak for what I ordered, and that was the Beef/Steak Zafferano. The steak was served with risotto and veggies. My steak was cooked to my preference. The seasoning was on point. 

Would come back."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner and it was ok. Nothing was worth drooling about to be honest. I ordered a lobster risotto with muscles and clams. There was a whole lobster on my plate and there was no lobster meat in it... Which was weird when it's the main part of the dish. My cousin got a cheese filled ravioli and she said it was okay. Most likely won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Food used to be amazing but has definitely gotten worse since. The service was horrible this evening perhaps because they were busy. Our antipasto took almost 40 minutes to arrive. For our entree we ordered the porcini risotto and penne a la vodka. The risotto was tasteless. The penne was far better. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"First time at Zaffaranos for me and my friends birthday dinner... Great place! Would highly recommend, the staff was welcoming even have our table a round of shots and also a dessert - because we we're celebrating a birthday. I ordered the Bistecca Zafferano, amazing! So fresh, cooked to perfection. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Ah maze ing. Some of the best fresh pasta I've had. Stuffed gnocchi is crazy good. Quality is outstanding. I travel the world. They near the top for this type of Italian restaurant.!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and come here often. Their seafood soup is the best. Also their calamari fritti is just amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this placeeeeee
Its so romantic and beautiful. The waiters are so kind and light hearted. Kept checking in and wishing us a good meal

I have come here a few times now and will definitely continue.

This time we had burrata (always get this here), arugula salad, zafferano pasta ( so velvety and delicious omg) and steak. The steak comes out on a board with little sides and sauces. Everything was so good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. 

The service is exceptional, and the food is amazing. 

If you've seen my other posts you'll know I'm a tough critic. I just had the steak with risotto, and it was so good. I love this place.."}
{"text":"I voted 5 stars not just because I proposed to my sweet wife here :) but the food and ambience is terrific. I suggest the grilled calamari to share between two plus a main. I tend to get the seafood pasta or the daily special. Weekends make certain to reserve. Sundays is private functions."}
{"text":"Best gnocchi of my life.
Just go.  Eat. Enjoy.
My husband and I ordered the gnocchi stuffed with ricotta (served in their rose sauce) and it was the most amazing gnocchi we have ever tasted.  It was soft and melt in your mouth goodness.  Just perfect.  I don't know what more you would want from a gnocchi!

He also ordered the basic marinara spaghetti dish and it was extremely good.  Pasta was cooked al dente, just the way we like it.  It's just that it was competing against the gnocchi...It was not a fair competition. But, would definitely recommend.

We also got the Caesar salad which I enjoyed also.  Lettuc was crisp and the dressing light and tasty.  

It was a perfect meal.  Couldn't get any better than that!  Go!"}
{"text":"Zafferano's is the type of restaurant that would get more notice if it was located in a trendy neighbourhood in Toronto.

The exterior is very non-descript as it's located in a strip mall in suburbia. However, the interior has a refined, classic feel that suits both large groups and intimate couples. 

The food itself is your standard Italian cuisine but executed effectively and for a reasonable price. The rigatoni peperonata, gnocchi (made in house), and flat iron steak were all hits. There is also an extensive wine list as you would expect. The staff are attentive and appear to genuinely care about their product. Would definitely recommend people check this place out....worth the time and money."}
{"text":"We visited Zafferano during Savour Vaughan, hoping this would give us the opportunity to find a new \"fave \" restaurant in the area. 3 of our group ordered from the Savour Vaughan menu, 1 of us ordered a-la-cart. 
Dining room was nice but tables were close together and you old clearly hear other conversations at other tables. Don't know if this is the norm or whether extra tables were added to accommodate the crowds for Savour Vaughan, but thats a small issue.
Waiter arrived and was very funny and made us feel welcome. He made recommendations, we ordered wine and it arrived shortly thereafter. Although it was busy, he came back to check on us frequently.
Food arrived and it was delicious.....everyone finished their meals and commented on how we'd return within the next month to sample other dishes.
Empty dishes sat in front of us longer than I would have expected for an establishment such as this...but it was VERY busy...so I can be forgiving to a point.
When we ordered our final stage of the meal (desserts and coffees) a so far great experience took a turn. We waited, and waited, and waited. Our drinks were prepared and sat on the counter waiting for our server to pick them up and deliver them to our table....to the point where actually thought of getting up and getting them ourselves. Once delivered, they were cold and undrinkable. Server asked if we didn't like them and we said they were cold...no replacements were offered.
This small issue at the end of a great meal was off putting.
We haven't been back and keep mentioning \"let's go here again\" but there are so many other places that we haven't returned. If only our coffees were hot........"}
{"text":"Right now at the dining room.  Finished eating appetizers at 7:50.  Till now (8:25PM) still no entrees.  Waiters walking around chatting around.  Not sure what's happening.

Left at 8:40.  No food no reasons given until complaining to the front bar area.  Request to speak with owner denied.  Manager said \"everyone ordered pasta.  We are extremely busy.  40 mins wait for food\".  

Sure, empty tables here and there... Extremely busy!?  Can't even give us an update where the foods were?  

You need to learn logistics better!!!"}
{"text":"This place is quite good. Great quality good and good ambience. Price is a bit high but fair for the quality and brand. I had the stuffed gnocchi with a group of friends and I thought it was delicious. Service was exceptional and the range of drinks available is quite impressive. Overall it's definitely a fun place to check out if you're in the area if you're looking for quality food and good experience without having to travel downtown. I think it's great for families (without very young kids) and would be ideal for dates or dinner with friends and colleagues."}
