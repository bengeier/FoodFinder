{"text":"First review of 2018, so I thought I would make it different.

I've been living between Little Italy and the Mile-End for the past 7 years and can give a pretty sweet recommendation as not somewhere just to visit, but to live in.

Little Italy itself is quite small, but packed with so much to do.

The Jean-Talon Market is the place to go for a fun time, it is pleasant and always bustling no matter when we go.

Parc St-Zotique, one of the most beautiful little parks on the Island, especially during Little Italy Week in August. Across the street is a basketball court as well a kid's playing area with water fountains.

St-Laurent Boulevard itself britsles with restos and coffee shops, there is actually a bit more variety than Italian restaurants here. The crown jewel of this stretch of the Main being Milano.

The best part about living here is how close it is to everything. It's always a 5 or 10 minute walk to: Plaza St-Hubert, Beaubien,Jean-Talon and Castelneau Metro, Mile-End, Mile-Ex, Parc-Ex, Outremont, Jarry Park, . 

While technically not in Little Italy itself, De Castelneau Street and Beaubien East  are also worth a detour, there are a dozen of coffee spots and between them and shops all around.

Why take away a star?  There is always congestion on St-Laurent and it really seems to be affecting the businesses here, a lot of them are unfortunately closed. The municipality seems to want it this way since St-Dominique turns into a one-way going south for some weird reason (even though it's very likely the widest one-way street in Montreal). Turning it back into a two-way street would definitely help the congestion issue.  People do not enjoy eating at a terrace next to dozens of stalled cars. Just my 2 cents"}

{"text":"Montreal's Little Italy is like a lot of things in Montreal: not really a \"sight\" in the tourism sense, quite small, understated, and, if you take your time and roll at the leisurely wine-and-weed-and-cheese inspired pace of so much of this city, totally utterly dreamy and lovely.

Dante park for a little bocce? Napoletana for pizza? Alati for a baked good and iced drink? Check out the architecture of Our Lady of Defense church, the old fire station on Shamrock, the tango dancing in the gazebo in parc de la Petite Italie. Nosh your way through the market. Enjoy the leafy streets like Drolet, grab a bixi and explore Jarry parc, go for coffees at Italia and at Vito. Just remember, the idea here is not to have any kind of extreme or even noteworthy experience or to see sights. It's just a sweet neighbourhood, rolling at a mellow happy pace, exemplifying the meaning of the phrase 'quality of life.'"}

Reasons why I love it:

- Huge selection of restaurants where you can get your boot-shaped country food fill
- Milano - Italian Supermarket extraordinare
- Dante - Part kitchen and home supply store - part gun shop and there forever.  Only in little Italy   
- Multimags- excellent magazine store and everything writing with other reading items
- Cafe Italia- serious espresso and cappuccino with all the young and old local people hanging around all day!  
- within walking distance to Marche Jean Talon
- All the shops, food stands and everything that is MJT.  For me a Food market such as this defines life of a city and emanates energy.  Best time of year for fresh veg is late June - late September.  
- Evangelista- Montreal's premiere soccer (futebol) store
- Shamrock Seafood
- Maya - for a mexican mix of fresh taco chips, mole and all things mexican - try their fresh salsa
- Joe La croute - artisan and fresh bread so dam good if you are a carb lover.  
- Napoletana - serious pizza.  
- Ducatti store - Of course this Italian moto company has a shop in little Italy.  
- El Rey Del Taco for excellent Mexican supplies and their salsa.  Try the 911 if you like insane hot salsa.  

So much more you need to come see it to experience!  It's one of my regular food tours of Montreal to stock up on supplies.  


In the summer it's overflowing with people all over the place.  This is life in it's best form!"}
