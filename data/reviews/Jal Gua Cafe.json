{"text":"This place is chock full of stellar organic superfoods, smoothies, juices, and coffee. The owner is an inspiring former child soldier turned peace activist who is revolutionizing food when he isn't making music! The name means \"walk in peace\" and the cafe is a huge benefit to the area. Wish I had found it sooner! Everyone who I've met that works there or hangs out inside is a real pleasure to chat with. Go check it out!!!"}

{"text":"This is an organic cafe run by former South Sudanese former child soldier Emmanuel Jal. The food is clean and refreshing. I loooooove their miracle bean salad. It keeps me full for hours. I tried the fermented sorghum porridge today. It was made with ginger, nuts and fresh fruit. Soooo delicious. The staff are kind and happy as apparently they work without hierarchy. An egalitarian workplace! When i came by there was a music event happening. It added to the cool mood."}
