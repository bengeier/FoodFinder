{"text":"On a golf trip and stopped in with the guys.  Looking for great Chinese food, lot of selection, and TV to watch the Sunday Night football game.  We got all that.  Very nice place, great staff and food.  We had Honey Chicken, Orange Chicken, Chicken lettuce wraps and macadamia nut chicken.  Not a scrap left on any of the plates.  It was great and the portions were huge!  I would definitely go back.  Also close to Cold Stone for ice cream."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood go to place. Been coming here since day one, sometimes its sooooo good and sometimes its just ok. I've tried most of the entree's and typically keep coming back to the thai cripsy beef. The rolls I like are the japanese, mexican and the lisa lisa. Service is usually very good.  But being a former server I notice things, that the typical person does not care about and imo management seems very unappealing to work for. But Im glad so mo has this place."}
{"text":"The food here does not taste bad but the whole dining experience is just not where it should be.

I remember going to this restaurant when it had just opened and the decor was not finished and they did not have  a liquor license, yet the food we had was tasty enough that we figured once they get everything going this could become a regular place to dine at.

unfortunately, that did not happen. Every time I visited this restaurant with the hopes of a great evening meal, they were always shattered by bad and slow service. I had but one good experience here and I should have left it at that and never gone back yet I did a week later and it was back to the same story.

Here is a short list of thing this place can not seem to get right.

- Slow Hostess service - A couple of times the place was half empty yet the hostess asked us to wait to be seated. Thirty to forty five minutes later I was still waiting, so I left.

- Slow food service - Many many times the sushi order took an excruciatingly long time, which could be understandable if the place was packed, yet most of the times there were only 2 to 3 other parties in the restaurant. Come on speed it up. i could probably learn how to make sushi faster than it took them to make ours.

- Timing - The Chinese food is always done very quickly to the point that they bring out main course almost right after the appetizers; and because the sushi orders always seem to take longer than needed, the pace at which the food is brought out is terrible.

- Waitress/Waiter - The waiters and waitresses here seem to not care to be there. They almost never introduced themselves and rarely come by to ask if anything else is needed nor to refresh our drinks.

- idiot Waitress - This specific entry on this list is for the last waitress we had that made me decide, never again to set foot at this place. She brought out our Chinese appetizers, then told us she will bring the Chinese main course since the sushi was backed up. Again with the slowness and only a couple of parties in the restaurant. She did not wait for us to be done with our appetizer and brought the Chinese entr√©e. She slid the food from the plate it came in and onto a hot plate and placed that on the table as close as possible to us and left. The thing was so sizzling hot that it was spattering oil up at us and all over the table. Oil got all over our shirts, the appetizer plates, the seats. When she came back we told her about it and asked for extra napkins. She brought the napkins and said , \"Oh sorry\" in a very unapologetic way. She obviously did not care. She left and brought out our sushi and then our check. This bitch then had the audacity to say to us when we were wiping the seat cushions next to us so we could slide out and leave that we made a mess. I tell you NEVER again...

Bottom line: No matter how many opportunities I gave this restaurant, they blew it every single time. Be warned if you have a good experience here, do not go back as they will undoubtedly screw it all up."}
{"text":"Had a chance visit Pan Asia this past Saturday after our 5.5 mile hike up South Mountain.  My sister and her bf raves about this place so we decided to lunch here at noon.

I liked the look and feel of the restaurant on the inside.  The place sort of feels trendy and reminded me a bit of the restaurants I used to frequent in L.A.  We requested a booth for our group of four and were seated pretty quickly (the table was way too high for the booth).  At noon on a Saturday, the place was halfway full.  

We found out that all food was 1/2 off regular prices on Saturday (dine-in only), so that excited me.  We ended up ordering the following items:

* Crispy Crab Puffs ($4/$2) - these little triangles of fried wontons filled with cream cheese and \"crab\" were delish...according to the others at my table.  I didn't try any, so can't attest the taste.  

* Crispy Tofu ($6/$3) - deep fried tofu cubes served with their supposed-to-be-spicy sauce.  Although not spicy, the sauce was awesome...think dark soy with caramelized sugar.  This was my fave dish.  

* Fire Roll ($15/$7.50) - A California-style roll topped off with their sauteed shrimp in a special sauce, with a Bacardi ring around the plate, which was lit by the waiter at our table.  The show was the best part of this roll.  CA rolls are so boring, and although the sauteed shrimp tasted good, it tasted exactly like the walnut shrimp dishes I've had at other restaurants.  (see photo)

* Japanese Lasagna ($10/$5) - A crab and avocado roll with cream cheese spread on top and baked until melted.  Call me crazy, but when I saw the name of this roll, I expected to see some pasta tossed with a wasabi-based sauce.  

* Las Vegas Roll ($8/$4) - Eel, \"crab\", avocado and cream cheese roll that's dipped in batter and deep fried.  These were decent, but what fried item isn't?  

* Chicken Fried Rice ($7.95/$3.98) - this was delicious!  They included many pieces of juicy chicken pieces.  The rice was fried perfectly...not greasy at all.  This and the deep fried tofu were my fave items.

The bill came to $27 (pre-tax and tip), so we felt we got a great deal.  The rolls are a bit on the skinny side, but not indecently so.  

Their menu is pretty vast, so I'm looking forward to going back and trying other dishes...especially the Chinese items."}
{"text":"This has become on of our family favs!  For the last 2 months, they have had 50% off their entire menu (including sushi) on the weekends which makes it a very affordable night out for the 4 of us.  The sushi is great and we have tried quite a few things there.  The fried rice and main dishes are all quite tasty as well.  I have also taken some clients there for lunch and they came back with their co-workers which all loved it.  The staff is very nice and the restaurant is very clean.  I also like that it isn't as loud as some of the other sushi places around town so you can actually talk.

So why did I give it a 4 and not a 5?  Sometimes they take a long time to check on you or bring the food out.  They are quick to bring the food out at lunchtime (which is good when you need to get back to work) but dinner can take a while.  The booths are kind of strange - the table isn't really the same shape as the booth so you are sitting far from the table (quirky I know, but true nonetheless).

So in a nutshell, Pan-Asia is a great bang for the buck.  The food is good and it is easy on the wallet.  And great for kids - we take our kids there and they love it."}
{"text":"When you leave a restaurant wondering when Gordon Ramsay will come bursting through the doors to scorn the frozen reheated calamari, the warm, parasitic fish, or the wilted parsley used to garnish the plate, you KNOW you're in trouble.

Where to begin? I knew the minute that the calamari arrived that this would be a negative experience. It was over-cooked, obviously of the frozen bagged variety, served with mae ploy. We were brought some fresh lemons which did help. The service wasn't terrible, but I was called \"honey\" all night long by someone about my age.

We ordered the Arizona roll, Spicy Tuna roll, Eel Tempura roll, Rainbow roll, and the Sex on the Beach roll. All of which had too much rice, to little seasoning, and low quality ingredients.

The worst was the Eel tempura. It tasted burnt, like it had been fried in bad oil. The Rainbow was next up, warm, disgusting so that we didn't eat it. The Sex on the beach (spicy with raw scallops and siracha), wasn't so bad, because I love spicy food. It was spicy enough that you couldn't taste the poor ingredients. The other two were just nasty-too much imitation crab, too much cream cheese, too much old cucumber, and warm, gelatinous looking fish. GROSS.

We like to sit at the sushi bar and it was so low and small- obviously so you can't see what the sushi chef is using for your rolls! Not the best ambiance. 

Save yourself time and money. Don't be fooled by their tempting \"discounts\"- $10 a roll (after 30% off)  is outrageous for the quality.

I can't comment on the drinks because we stuck to water. They don't have Saturday drink specials.

I will stick to my old standbys Kyoto or Sakana. Cheap, fast, and more delicious than any sushi I've had in the Phoenix area. If you want all the glitz and glam, go to Ra or Blue Wasabi. So what if you have to drive 30 more minutes."}
{"text":"Extremely confused by these negative reviews, some as recent as last week even?! I've been coming to this remarkable establishment for a little over two months and have yet to have anything but impeccable service and outstanding meals.

The staff was courteous, engaging and quick. Our dishes came out fresh and were truly fantastically presented. The Lisa Lisa Crunch and OMG rollls were amazing, the fried crab wontons are a must have, and our waiter recommended a hamachi sashimi dish that was so delectable, I wanted to lick the plate. I have yet to try the Chinese dishes off the menu, but the couple to our left had a chicken dish that smelled unholy good.

The first time I went, I was not expecting much, the location (strip mall) and the outside of the building do not do the inside justice. It was clean, well decorated and surprisingly adorned with multiple flat screen TVs with a veritable cornucopia of sport programming playing on them.

Sat at the bar every time we went, and the bartender/server was a real treat suggested great dishes and ultimately added to the overall experience. On a whim, we pulled up the yelp page as we were finishing up and we saw the terrible reviews and had to put in our two cents.

Give this place a try during happy hour, pull up a seat at the bar, relax and enjoy a delicious meal."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night because they had a 30% off thing going on, which is always nice.  The sushi selection is pretty limited, so if you're looking for sushi alone you might want to find someplace with a larger menu.  The sushi that we did get was pretty good though, well made and flavorful.  The entrees are also pretty standard Chinese fare, but were also pretty good.

We were pretty underwhelmed by the service though.  Our waitress seemed inattentive and missed out on a lot of the little things like making sure to put the plates on the table where you can reach them rather than having to lean all the way across.  It is possible she was merely new and didn't know what she was doing, but overall I got a somewhat unprofessional vibe from the rest of the staff as they just kind of stood around shooting the breeze.

I was also surprised that they charged for an extra serving of rice with the entree; every other place I have been too does not charge.  

Overall, pretty good food, less than stellar service.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back, although the prices were pretty good and that might help to make up for it :)"}
{"text":"After 3 visits I'm convinced this will become one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Phoenix.  Three visit and have loved everything I have tasted and the service and has always been excellent. This is a great addition to South Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and Chinese food. There is one tattooed bartender that gives excellent advise regarding sushi choices. Great happy hour specials. The only knock on the place is the hodgepodge decor."}
{"text":"Great Asian fusion place! Our waiter, Chris, was EXCELLENT. I ordered one of their vegetable dishes and he came back to tell me it had a type of seafood sauce on it (I believe it was scallops?). I don't eat meat or dairy, so I greatly appreciated his input. The price was also very reasonable. I'm definitely going back during a lunch hour!"}
{"text":"This has long been one of our favorite restaurants in South Mountain and we ate there on a regular basis.  However, we will not return after last night.  We had received a coupon for $20 off back in December. We were told the coupon was valid for a year and the expiration date written on the coupon was November 2012.  We had been back several times, but forgot to bring the coupon with us.  We finally remembered to take it last night and presented it with our large bill.  The manager came to tell us that this coupon expired months ago and that it was no longer valid.  She then accused us of changing the date on the coupon,  essentially calling us cheats and liars.  She told us she didn't have to accept the coupon, but grudgingly took the $20 off the check.  The manager was so ungracious about the whole thing, we will never return.  The food is good, the servers are pleasant, but the current management is awful."}
{"text":"Yikes! What happened to this place? This was a neighborhood joint I was delighted to have pop up a couple of years ago. They had some of the best sushi to be found in the Valley, great drinks and great specials. I remember the service being just fine and the place always packed.

It's been probably over a year since I have been in and finally decided to revisit. It was Valentine's weekend so we called for a reservation because I remember it always taking a long time to be seated. The woman on the phone said they were not busy and to just come by. That should have been the first sign something was wrong.

My fiance and I got seated in probably the most unappealing table in the place. It was awkward and by the door. We ordered drinks which took forever to come out considering it was pretty empty.

We ordered our food and 10-15 minutes later our server came back and told us he lost our order and asked if we could tell him again what we wanted. 

Our Chinese food came out first, several minutes later our sushi came out, followed by our rolls. The fried rice we ordered never did come out. The sushi was not so great, it fell apart and tasted fishy. We had the Pan Asia Fire Starter roll. It was fine and spicy sure, but not the fabulous rolls I once remembered. I did not bother to tell our server about the fried rice. I was disappointed and was sure he wouldn't care enough to discount our bill. 

Now came the worst part. Waiting for the bill. I made eye contact several times with our server and he never came. When he came by to take the order of the couple next to us I was ready to grab him. My fiance over heard him tell the couple he lost their order and he needs to take it again! Unbelievable! We still did not get our check so fiance went up to the bar to ask for it. He was ignored by two other waitresses who literally stood in-front of him never bothering to look up and ask if he could be helped. After 20-25 minutes of total time waiting I finally waived down our server and asked for the check and pointed to my fiance at the bar .

Sadly, I probably wont be going back. At least not for awhile. The food has gone downhill (what happened to their old sushi chef? He was fantastic!). The service is TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Stopped in and got a lunch special combo of sushi and chinese food. The food was good, but the kung pao chicken didn't come with any kind of rice, which made the \"value\" of the lunch special much less valuable since I had to pay for a side of rice to enjoy the meal. I will probably be back for another lunch since the food was good enough, but I will probably just get a sushi combo plate instead of the chinese/sushi. As a side note, the music playing here was all over the place - Shania Twain followed directly by some hardcore rap and then some random cover songs. Very strange."}
{"text":"This place has gone way downhill.  The sushi smelled terrible.  No wonder it is empty in here now."}
{"text":"12 months ago I would have lit up all the stars for this place. But just like Christine O. said - it's gotten progressively worse! When this place first opened I ordered at least once a week. 
The sushi was incredibly fresh and flavorful. 

One of the last time's I ate there, I ordered for everybody at the office - we all got food poisining from the sushi. 

4 months later (today) I decided to try it again. I ordered a tootsie roll and their \"crispy\" tofu. The roll had absolutely NO flavor and was mushy. The \"crispy\" tofu was raw. The breading was raw, the tofu was raw. Not sure what happened there guys.. but I had to throw my entire $15 lunch away. Also, I noticed both sushi chefs whom I loved were not there.. maybe it was their day off... maybe not."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, my boyfriend and I came here on a whim and found that it is the best sushi and chinese food ever. The Lisa Lisa rolls are amazing along with the rest of the menu, we've tried both their sushi and their chinese food, its all great. It's decently priced as far as sushi and restaurant dinning go. The atmosphere is lovely and the staff is extremely friendly and prompt to provide service. Don't be fooled a lovely place to dine out and if you're on a budget their lunch specials are extremely inexpensive. Have yet to try their dessert but I have faith that it's just as delicious as the rest of the food here. :] 
To the Pan-Asia staff and owner, my boyfriend and I now call this our restaurant, thank you for allowing memories to flourish in your wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"love this place, it's quick, affordable and easy.  nothing too fancy but a great place for some sushi or other dishes...we sneak in here at least once every other week or so.  I started trying some dishes rather than always reverting to the sushi and I LOVE the thai shrimp dish.  so yummy can't wait to come back for some more :) 

not sure what all these complainers expect from a restaurant like this, it's not roka akor or mastro's...it's pan asia people lol give it a try the price is right, the people are friendly and I love the food"}
{"text":"Good food, although the sushi is variable. 
Usually the sushi is good, but once in a while it is sloppily constructed and served warm. I have also had a couple of not-so-fresh sushi selections here.  The other night I had Ikura that was a bit off. 

Altogether though, a decent value and friendly staff. 
Though friendly, the staff seems not really sure of how to provide a good experience. If I order soup, an appetizer and an entree, they all show up at once. Once you're done eating your food, you have to hunt them down for a check. 

Also, it seems like every time I go there, someone is mopping the floor with stinky mop water. Not only does it smell bad, but cleaning the place when I'm still eating (yes, I go there late) tells me, \"I wish you'd leave so I can go home.\" If that's how you feel, then close the place earlier."}
{"text":"I come here quite often for lunch! I work close and wanted something that was not overly priced, quick and not super packed. This is my go to place for sushi and occasionally happy hour. The prices are good ,service is excellent!"}
{"text":"We used to consider going to Pan Asia as a treat, one of our \"go to\" places.  We LOVED the fact that they had a \"special\" menu on Saturday night that allowed the two of us to eat at least 2 rolls and an order of crab puffs for $20.  It's almost like once they deep 6'd that, the rest of the experience went downhill with it.  But it was still good enough so we were still going.  

Until last week.  We were there about 10 minutes after they opened on Friday and I had to use the restroom.  It stunk like garbage and rotting fish in the bathroom, which coincidentally had had a garbage can propping it open to air it out.  

We ordered 3 small salads, 2 rolls (one was cooked), and 1 order of chicken potstickers.  When our water arrived, two out of our three glasses had dead gnats floating in them.  When we told the server she made no apology, just looked at the glasses as she walked off and returned with two \"new\" glasses.  Only difference was these had lemon in them and our original waters did not.  The chicken potstickers arrived a good 10 minutes before our rolls did and the server didn't apologize for the wait or let us know when the rolls were almost done.  By this point, I was almost afraid of what would happen once I did eat my sushi roll!  But I did and it was tasty, yet I was still disgusted.  $50 for that horrible experience.  Unfortunately, we had a friend with us who was in town for a visit and we were embarrassed that we had told her how much we loved this place.  Add Pan Asia to the Never Again list!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the sushi is amazing sometimes, usually seems to happen around lunch time it is terrible. Which is why I give it an average rating. You are never exactly sure what you are going to get might as well flip a coin and hope for the best"}
{"text":"There's some good and some bad with this place.  Let's start off with the good.  Great food!  Great price!  Had my first outting to Pan Asia and was really digging the decor of the place.  Huge tv's over the bar... plenty of seating.  Lunch menu was good, ordered a \"C\".  Which pretty much was a spicy tuna roll, spicy california roll, and spicey salmon roll.  Lunch also came with salad and soup for just $9.  Also tried the crab-puffs...which to my surprise, had more crab then cream cheese.  They also have draft beers and bottle beers, though don't know about their draft beer cause it was being working on when we got there so I stuck with water. But overall the food was very good especially for that price.  

Now let's talk about the bad.  For me the bad was the service.  Our server didn't seem like she wanted to be there at all.  Kind of like blah.  She wasn't mean, but she was kind of a drag.  She was also slow, the people around us called the manager cause they had been sitting there and our server never went over to them to get their order.  She needs to cheer up or maybe get a job where she can be all blah.  Maybe it was just a bad day for her.  Either way I'll continue to frequent Pan Asia and just make sure I sit in another servers section."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and waited over an HOUR for some sushi!! Everyone at my table ate were served their food and my sister was already done with hers by the time I got my plate! But the sushi was good... but an HOUR?! WTF?! NOT COOL!!!"}
{"text":"I was sitting at work wondering what the heck to eat for lunch. I hopped on Yelp, popped in my work addy and did a search. After getting a few results, I settled on trying Pan Asia. 

I hopped in the g-ride and headed over. When I walked in to this strip mall location, I was very surprised. This was modern and sleek decor with flat panel TVs and cool music bumping over head. Wow! 

I decided to sit at the bar for my meal. I was STARVING so I chose to go with the deluxe sushi combo. I was just drinking water and had to trouble 2 people to finally obtain a lemon for my drink. It was a slight annoyance. When my plate arrived, I was delighted by the presentation. On the platter were 2 pieces of yellowtail , a salmon a tuna, a black pepper tuna and the dish usually comes with 8 pieces of spicy tuna roll, but I asked for spicy yellowtail instead. I was so glad that I was starving! 

The quality of the fish at Pan Asia is so-so. It isn't bad, but it's not without a bit of aftertaste and certainly isn't the highest quality. Again, you won't get sick, or you won't be horrified by the sushi, it's just middle grade. 

On my second visit, I got to try the \"Fire Roll\" which is a California roll inside, sauteed garlic shrimp all covered with eel sauce and Bacardi 151 lit on fire. It makes a great presentation and is very tasty for those who don't enjoy raw fish. 

I would highly suggest this place for run-of-the-mill sushi. I would especially suggest it for those who are with fellow diners who do not eat sushi as Pan Asia offers a full menu of Chinese cuisine. 

I know that Pan Asia will become one of my regular lunch spots for a quick sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Overall, its A-OK. The sushi is good for the cost. They had/have a REALLY good happy hour deal. However, the menu and the happy hour seem to change too frequently. 

If I could I would give 5 stars to the Veggie Chow Mein. It gives me tastegasms. MMMM!!!!

I also LOVE the Lisa Lisa Crunchy Roll. 

The service is good, staff is overall friendly."}
{"text":"OK, buyer beware!! We have been frequenting this place for over a year but the service is so hit or miss...recently we had purchased a gift certificate from restaurant.com and decided to redeem it. When we tried to redeem the certificate at the beginning of our order, the waitress acted strange and went and got the manager. She was very rude and acted like we were trying to rip her off and said that they no longer are with that company. I said that is fine, but why aren't you honoring the certificates already purchased. She acted like she was doing us a favor by directing us to their happy hour menu or she would give us 10% off our meal. What a rip off!!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting place atmosphere is good, however, the music is horrible, not too sure why \"club music\" has to be playing.. They also have 3 TV's playing 3 different show... So what does this place want to be??????? The was just OK too."}
{"text":"Hmmm... This place is very interesting. Let me start with the Atmosphere. Well it's nicely decorated, but during lunch they were playing loud Dance music with the TV's tuned to various channels (on mute). Kind of a weird sports bar/Ra/Club atmosphere but oddly enough it works for them. For starters I had the crab puffs which were more like \"pockets\". The filling was good but I hate the way they were folded, it made them more greasier than normal. They have really inexpensive lunch specials which all come with the house salad. I ordered the Orange Chicken and the Vegas roll for only $6.99! The Orange Chicken was very forgettable; there was not enough sauce on them and they were more like popcorn chicken. However, the roll is what I came here for and I was not disappointed. I loved all the flavors of the roll and can easily see myself coming back for just that if nothing else. I will come back to the place next time during Happy Hour as they seem to have some pretty good deals during that time as well. PS- Great customer service, I had my drink refilled 4 times within my 40 minute lunch stay ( I'm a thirsty desert girl :-)"}
{"text":"Have not been disappointed here. The food is always cooked fresh and on time. I love the ambiance. All the plasmas and pretty tableware make for a great date night or lunch with friends. I have tried the plum chicken and and recently the vegas rolls. I really enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"WOW!  this place is amazing!  for $6.99 you can get their lunch special - a Chinese entree and a sushi roll.  and the quality is superb!  the Twist roll was seriously the best roll I have ever had, and I have had plenty!!  I highly recommend this place for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Since the ownership has increased their business (and their prices) things have gone WAY downhill.  They use to be the cute neighborhood place and now they're not.  I have been here at least a dozen times since I live just down the street.
Three months ago I made a reservation for a party at the restaurant and said they would honor their 50% off on Saturday prices.  Two weeks ago I planned out the menu with the manager, confirmed head count and agreed on the pricing.  This evening, I went in for dinner and to check on the contract I never received to find out that they were no longer going to honor pricing.  I would have paid the extra 20% they were asking but I had already been told by 2 different people it would be honored and all I needed was to sign a contract.  After asking for the owner's information, I had the woman I was dealing with tell me she was the owner when I know for a fact she's not.  
The food I had was also terrible tonight--HARD RICE!  And things are getting more and more expensive.  
If you want terrible food and service, then go here."}
{"text":"Ok used to love this place when it first opened, key word used to.
I will keep it short and simple the servers don't even know what is in a california roll. I always order a cali with all of my sushi because I find it refreshing, everyone knows that everywhere you go a california has crab avacado and cucumber. Well apparently not this place our roll came out and the sever fed us this line about how they were not putting cucumber in the roll anymore because it was cooked............. I know it made no sense to me either. I worked in a real sushi bar for many years so I know my suff, it is sad to me when I have to tell the servers what should be in a california roll. I am over this place."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I want to start off by saying that our server (Riley) was awesome and we loved how attentive and friendly she was. However, the food was not as good as we would have liked. We ordered a bunch of stuff off the happy hour menu (first time here) and I could not believe how teeny tiny the $3.00 edamame was. It was a like a joke how incredibly skimpy the portion size was. All the other happy hour items were very small too, so you have to order quite a few to fill up on. The taste of the food was decent, but I've had better. In fact, literally right across the street from this place in my favorite sushi place (Sun Asian Kitchen), which I go to about once a week. Over there the portions are much better, the food is really good and the place is usually packed. The only reason we came to Pan Asia was because we wanted to try a new place to see how it compared to Sun Asian Kitchen... and I must say, for my money, I'd rather just go across the street and continue eating at Sun Asian Kitchen."}
{"text":"I work near this place so occasionally i'll hop in for lunch.  the lunch specials have a good price and IMO, a good amount of food.  The service has always been quick/attentive and I'm kinda surprised to see so many negative reviews."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service & excellent food. Stangely, it's the management that tends to be weird.

I would probably like the place a lot more if management (and you know they're management because they're called over for help) would do more than just glare at large bundles of customers waiting for service at the door. It's awkward to have people stare at you from the bar while you wait for someone to seat you.

The servers on the other hand, are awesome. They are especially awesome on weekends, and the variety of deals and meal specials always makes for and slew of fun new sushi and entrees to try. Their take-out is also awesome, but that's where the managers (who will likely be the people staring/glaring at you from the bar) usually show themselves to be especially irksome. 

While you stand there waiting... And waiting... And waiting...

But I reiterate, while I don't care for awkward bouts of standing around, I love the service and I'm quite fond of the food. Pop in on Saturday for their best deals though, that way you can sample the food on the menu. I don't drink so I can't comment to their alcohol."}
{"text":"I come here about twice a month since I work a couple miles from here. The place is nice, and although the hostess looks as though she is irritated all the time, the servers are nice and friendly. 
This place has a great atmosphere with a decent bar and multiple television shows playing whatever.
The salad they serve is AWESOME. I myself am extremely picky on my salads, but I can eat theirs anytime. 
I always buy the little combo meals with come with 5 different selections (eg: Orange Chicken) and some type of sushi... for $6.99! I will say the portion of your selection is rather on the small side, but the sushi roll seems just list any other. The taste is good, the food is fresh, all around this is one place you should try."}
{"text":"The food here isn't just fusion, so is the staff. I was greeted by an hispanic woman and then my order to go was taken by a white dude with a blue mohawk. While I waited for food, the asian owner also chatted with me about online specials. Caught the last few minutes of happy hour and had a $2 small glass of domestic beer. As long as the quality of food is better, I don't mind paying $2-$3 more for an entree as was the case here with my $9.25 order of Chicken with sweet peas (pea pods), red peppers, onions in a brown garlic sauce. The food was good, tasted fresh and they give you a choice of fried of white rice for free with your entree. Seems like this could be the neighborhood Chinese joint for me, but need to try a few more dishes, but clearly this meal was a great start."}
{"text":"We're still on our adventure to find the best chinese restaurant in the Gilbert/Mesa area. We passed this place and decided to give it a try. Like another poster have already said, the sign/logo of the place threw me off. It was a moon logo with the letters 's' and 'a'. But then it said Pan Asian. Wasn't sure of the name of the place...eh, maybe the food is good?

The ambiance of the place was nice, there was a live group playing jazz, lots of modern fixtures, furniture, and paint job--but small. There were only maybe 5 customers in the place, 1 waitress, and 3 cooks. I was surprised the menu had Chinese, Japanese, Singapore, Malyasian food, sounded great. 

I ordered, saying that \"I wanted the Sunrise Shrimp and Veggie Udon\", (mind you the traditional udon is a thick, white noodle soup in a broth with veggies and meat usually). She must have misheard me, she said, \"shrimp and veggies\"? I said \"yes\". She bought out a plate of just the shrimp and veggies! No udon. It looked like chow mein. I was sssoooo disappointed. How is this part of the Japanese menu? It's more like Chinese food! It was greasy and the ingredients weren't very memorable, except that it reminded me of Panda Express. 

We both felt like we could have cooked a bag of sir-fry at home and done better. I felt like I ordered a supreme pizza, but got just the toppings served to me a la carte. We orded the California and Cucumber roll, which the proportions came out wwayyy smaller than I imagined. They were mini-sized and had teriyaki sauce poured all over them already! I guess maybe I am picky with Japanese food, but you don't usually have sushi pre-dipped in sauces already. 

The bar seems like it would be a nice place to hang out, decor is good, but the food... quite honestly sucks. It's a good thing she is so nice though, although she could have come back to check on how we were doing during the meal. We got out of there so fast that I actually forgot to pick up my credit card, and she ran after us and returned it to me. Maybe we'll try this place one more time (just because she is so nice), but if the food doesn't get any better than this, I can get the same thing at Mr. Chau's for a lot less.

Ooops, I meant to post this for the location in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Totally fine.  Excellent sashimi.  The broccoli-beef chinese dish looked fine, fresh broccoli.
Get the sake combo with a huge beer for $699
Slow service, but fine, what do you expect?
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Want chinese and sushi for lunch but you are on a budget?  Well here you can have great tasting las vegas roll with some bomb orange chicken for $6.99.  You can't beat that price.  normall las vegas rolls cost between $7-$10 by themselves.  You also get a great tasting salad with some great house dressing.  They have other great lunch specials and variety.  Looks like a great hang out spot, great atmosphere.  I wasn't extremely full and wasn't hungry either, just satisfied."}
{"text":"Well this place isn't too bad. Maybe I just didn't know what to order... I love sushi but I don't think pan Asia meet my standard when it Comes to sushi. The service was good. Maybe ill try there food next time...."}
{"text":"Great sushi in the desert??? This place was such an unexpected surprise. The ambiance was perfect, the service was superb and the sushi was fresh and delicious. The OMG roll was exactly \"OH MY GOODNESS\" good!!!! And if you are a sake enthusiast....you've got to try the peach sake cocktail, unbelievable! Next time I'm in Arizona, I will definitely head back to this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times at the lunch hour and also for dinner. 
tonight is very special! The Happy hour here is great!

Wait staff was very pleasant and accommodating. 

Issues with the Female manager! 
she was \"in your face\" with our dinner companion regarding menu options and possible substitution (we said we would pay the difference) 
It could have been handled a bit differently. 

Over all, the happy hour food, sushi and drinks made us happy campers! 
we will be back!"}
{"text":"Why would you go at a time other than the 50% off I want to know?  I wish it was the whole menu and not just part of it.  The prices are fair and the food was pretty good.  The ambiance was way nicer than I expected."}
{"text":"I eat hear every few weeks and the food is consistently good.  I've seen some mixed reviews on the Sushi, but I have yet to try it here.  Quick and polite service are always on hand as well as reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I went here after being picked up from the airport with my roommate. She had been to a happy hour here before and liked it so I said, \"sure, lets go.\"

The atmosphere was nice, but I should have heeded my own hesitation about the name of this place. I usually steer clear of any pan Asian offerings because no one can do all Asian cooking well. I rather have one cuisine that someone done right then a pan Asian place with so-so everything. 

This place ended up just being that. Their non-happy hour menu is a tad on the pricey side with smaller rolls and fewer pieces for what I've come to expect for the price point. Oh, and there is gratuitous use of eel sauce. Holy cow! Everything that had eel sauce just tasted like it was drowning in a sea of eel sauce. This place is just alright."}
{"text":"Pan Asia is great to take friends that want to explore multiple asian cuisines. The sushi is okay but the Chinese dishes never let me down. The Mongolian beef is delicious. There is a full bar and its an easy going atmosphere. Great for a group of 4-6."}
{"text":"My husband and son bought me $40 in gift certificates for Pan Asia. Its is right by our house and we always enjoyed going there for dinner. Unfortunately, we tried going there for dinner last night to use the gift certificates they just bought last month and the place is closed!! There's lien signs on the doors and windows! So angry that we JUST bought gift certificates and took our money and they're shut down so I can't even use them!"}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food!

My parents recently discovered this place and they've dragged us into their fan club for Pan Asia. They're known for their sushi, but I do not eat sushi so I couldn't really give a review on that. Although, my sister and brother in-law order their sushi and love it, so it must be great. Everything seems as if it's always fresh here. I usually order their chicken chow mein or  chicken lettuce wraps. I've tasted their egg soup which is very good!! My parents have ordered their walnut shrimp and that is amazingly delicious, though sometimes is has too much of the creamy sauce. 

Overall, Pan Asia is a great place to get fresh and delicious Chinese food. They have a 50% off menu certain days so you can get a great deal for a meal."}
{"text":"Tried to come here for lunch and I don't know if they are going to opening back up anytime since there is a notice from landlord. Looks like maybe didn't pay rent...either way, they are NOT open"}
{"text":"There is nothing fusion about this place that I could find.  They have a japanese and a chinese menu but the dishes do not seem to be a mix of the two at all.  The waiter was really good even though he got the order wrong he had great recovery.  This place makes the best sushi I have had in Phoenix.  It is higher priced but it has quantity and quality. 

$10 is too much for 5 tempura shrimp that were small.  Probably a 24-30 per pound.  At this price the shrimp needs to be bigger or the price needs to be reduced.

I would not go here for the Chinese menu.  It is extensive but seems to need work."}
{"text":"I love happy hour, but it always seems to come and go too early for me to get my friend Jason B. out to dinner. So  when we find out a reverse happy hour, we have to go try it!

We walked in to Pan Asia at the start of reverse happy hour and we were greeted like they have never seen people in their lives. The hostess proceeded to tell us that they haven't seen anyone in a few hours. 

As we had pick of the restaurant we picked the best booth and sat back to enjoy some Sushi and Chinese food. 

We ordered a few rolls, the Spicy Tuna was disappointing and nothing to rave about. The Lasagna roll was creamy and cheesy and very yummy! The Grand Canyon roll was one of the best rolls I have had in a while.

We also ordered a noodle dish, Pan Asia Pan Fried Noodle, crunchy noodles with lots of good veggies and seafood. Very tasty.

The service was as good as can be expected for a young boy server, although I had to wait a while for a refill, which is extremely annoying when you have a restaurant to yourselves!

I just worry that the prices, which unless on Happy Hour or Reverse, seem a little high. $14 for a sushi roll, no matter how good, is just too expensive. And the fact that they don't have a ton of customers...maybe just a slow night? I hope this place makes it. The owners obviously put a lot of money into it!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place good amount. Nothing fantastic, but had some good deals that made it worth coming down every once in a while. I think they recently changed ownership and I am not pleased with the new managers. We had an issue with our bill, and the manager came up and fought with us rather than correct the mistake; I was stunned. Needless to say, I do not like to spend my nights out with someone questioning my integrity, so I cannot see coming here again deal or not. 

As I said the only thing that made this place somewhat worth the price was when you could catch a half off weekend or happy hour, not even sure it is worth that anymore."}
{"text":"The management of this restaurant is clueless, the food is mediocre. This restaurant offers brown rice option for sushi and that is the reason I used to come there. On my last visit I was charged an additional $8 for brown rice on a $25 bill. After speaking to the manager the outrageous mark up was not removed or adjusted. I informed them this is the last time I am coming there and was told \"ok, thats fine..\" by the manager....WOW, really?!!  As far as the food goes, be cautious because many rolls are deepfried and taste funny, fresh sushi w brown rice was the only reason worth coming here but at this point it's not worth the marked up price"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are always great. I do hate sitting in the booths here cause they always feel like they are too low compared to the height of the table. I've been there several times and the service hasn't been as bad as what other yelpers have experienced. But when the service is bad it's ussually because the waiter is waiting tables and trying to bartend at the same time. I think that if the owner rethought how the tables were laid out it might help some too."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we decided to give this place a try. I'm not usually a big sushi eater, but I decided to give some a shot and was pleasantly surprised! The flavors in the two different varieties we ordered was fantastic. We then split an order of the Mongolian Chicken and it was delicious. The chicken tasted fresh, unlike some other Asian restaurants we have been to. The atmosphere was very hip and trendy and our waitress was a blast! We will ABSOLUTELY be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Good selection of rolls. I only got to try the Scottsdale and some other special sashimi. Definitely filled me up. They were very friendly too. Would try again for the other sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Took my sister for her 19th birthday here and I was blown away by the decor, and the nice atmosphere in this place, I also heard it has the only sushi for miles around. 
A little out of the way but worth it, My sister ordered the fiery sushi plate that was lit on fire, just like Christmas pudding, as it was coming out to the table, then she ordered this Sushi Martini?? 
It came out with beautiful sashimi as you see in the pix complete with roe and horseradish thinly sliced. 
The menu is huge and ranges from Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Chicken and of course the famous pot stickers, gyoza to some. 
Truly a delightful experience and for you sports lovers there is 3 huge flatscreens radiating from the great granite bar with top shelf liquor."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place. The service was terrible. The hostess couldn't even smile when she seated us. Even though we went in during the lunch rush, it was not that busy but nobody came to our table for a good ten minutes. 
When she finally came to the table she was talking so fast that I felt rushed. I asked her a question about an item on the menu and she thought that was my order and almost walked away. I had to tell her to slow down and answer my question. After she finally let us have a few more minutes to look at the menu she kept calling me honey which was awkward. 
Overall the food was ok but with the crappy service and rushed atmosphere I don't think I would go back. 
I wasn't able to order the lunch combo because they wouldn't substitute the chicken for veggies."}
{"text":"Great appetizers with outstanding flavors.Pricing very reasonable during Happy hour .Staff can be very attentive at times but other times not so much.A.c. wasn't at 100% when we were there recently even the staff was fanning themselves ; ("}
{"text":"It is a fine place to go once in a while. The food is fine. I feel like the lunch specials are a little overpriced. The atmosphere is nice. They can accommodate a large group."}
{"text":"I continue to be surprised at some of the negative reviews about the food here. This place has become a staple in our neighborhood diet for the last 3 years. We have tried several different items on their menu from soup to appetizers to sushi and the main dishes... And remain impressed! We often bring out of town guests here for dinner and they have all enjoyed what was ordered. 

The service has gotten better over the years, although they do sometimes seem shorthanded... I think some of this is compounded by the fact that you never can tell when it will be busy here and when it won't. For example one Sunday night it will be dead and another it will be packed. The place is clean and they have great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place being good.. One being that it is down the street from my house and two they have sushi n saki! Well lets just say the 45 mins I was there it took that entire time to get a round of sake bombs (and I was even served the wrong beer on top of that!) and 2 sushi rolls which where not that good. The Vegas rolled tasted like it was cook in months old oil and the califorina roll smelled like old crab that died on the shore of Mexico. Even the people next to me had a big order and got less than half their food, by that time they just said CHECK PLEASE, which is the same thing I did. If you're looking for take out I'm sure this place is okay, but if you're coming for sushi and saki seek else where! The travel will be well worth it! Three words Sakana Sushi Bar"}
{"text":"I've been there about a dozen times for lunch in the short time they've been open. They have good food, but I was slightly disappointed in today's lunch. I don't believe I was supposed to get miso with my sushi combo lunch, but it was in my bag, so I shouldn't complain, but it was all broth. There was not 1 tofu cube or leaf of seaweed in it.
The california roll crab meat was like the Krab salad you buy at a grocery store. The eel roll had too much sauce, which turned it into a sweet dish instead of contrasting flavors. The tuna roll also was mushy inside the wrap. The seaweed wasn't crispy.
That being said, the value (specifically for lunch) is incredible. I had 24 pieces of sushi and miso soup with a small salad for 10 bucks. They have 6 sushi roll combos and 5 bento lunch combos for under $10. They also have very reasonably priced Chinese lunch combos (such as sweet and sour pork, fried rice and mongolian beef, $7.) I will try to post a picture of the go-box; it's amazing how much you get! (I ate one piece of eel roll on the way home because I couldn't wait.)
The taste is still very good, but this trip wasn't as impressive as past trips. This may have been a bad day though. I'm still a regular here!"}
{"text":"Wow, nearly a year ago I had dinner with 
my husband at Pan Asia.  The brothers worked the Sushi bar then.  We were introduced to their flare of Sushi and loved it. They greeted who ever walked in and sold their special that day. 

Today, the brothers are gone and so is their Sushi flare.   The customer service isn't much to appreciate either.  Well the 50% discount on the Chinese food is something to look forward to."}
{"text":"Pan Asia is one of Phoenix's hidden jewels. Tucked away in a strip center on 24th & Baseline, Pan Asia is a great alternative to expensive, trendy sushi joints. I eat sushi at Pan Asia at least every other weekend and can say that Pan Asia's sushi is just as good if not better than RA. Not to mention cheaper, especially if you go there on one of their half off Saturday's or during happy hour. 

I feel like Norm from Cheers when I go there and the staff is very friendly. Their friendliness is what you should come to expect from a family run restaurant. I especially like John who is hilarious. If you get to know John he will keep you laughing the whole time you are there and will make sure your drinks are never empty. 

I highly recommend the Fire Roll, a California roll with a nice sized sauteed shrimp on top drizzled with a sweet and mildly spicy sauce surrounded with Bacardi 151 that they light on fire to create the ultimate sushi experience. For tuna lovers, go with the Sama Roll which is a spicy tuna roll topped with a black peppered spiced slice of Ahi. 

Hope this review helps and if you are in on a Friday or Saturday night I'm sure you'll see me there. Can you pick me out???"}
{"text":"Wow what a disaster this place was for my first time and last time. 

I should have known better to have ordered sushi from a place that can't decide weather or not they want to be a sushi place, a Chinese place or pan Asian fusion. 

The service was great, they were very attentive about the problem and did what ever they could to try to convince me to come back. But it was a little over board at times and made something small into a huge incident. 

I ordered sushi, big mistake! I should have stuck with my ice tea. I asked if they had toro and they said they did. I like to try toro from different places since it is a great judge of character for the rest of the sushi, also based on the spicy tuna. I also ordered salmon since it is something hard to mess up. 

Let's being, first I received my plate and there were my three orders. I looked at it close and was very confused. The waitress noticed this as well, she asked me why I was looking at it like I never seen sushi before. Well to start, the toro was not toro, it wasn't even a fatty grade big eye or even blue fin which sometimes can be very fatty and passed as toro by some places. This my friends was normal tuna, red in color and not the best cut either. There was a huge tendon going through the two pieces of nigiri I ordered. The salmon had black speckles of something on it, looks to be pepper or something, which tells me the chefs hands might not have been clean. I didn't even want to look at the roll at this point. 

I sent it back saying I don't want the tuna since it was obviously not toro. The waiter took it back and the chef threw a fit saying it was toro. Obviously not a very experienced chef, he must have thought since it was a belly cut (judging from the tendon) from a yellowfin or big eye tuna it must be toro right? 

Oh and the staff for not knowing their own product, how can a chef, manager and wait staff not even know the sushi they sell? Its something that is supposed to bring in the most profit for them and yet they are uneducated in it. 

All in all, my experience there was something that was very offending. The chef assuming that because he says it is what he says it is it must be, not everyone is a beginner sushi eater and looks like they take advantage of the locals in the area of their inexperience and have done this before.You never know who could be your next customer, a critic, a yelper, a sushi connoisseur or even a fellow chef looking for a quick bite to eat while helping a friend move. 

Hopefully they will have learned from this and change things up but I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"I'm actually in Pan Asia while I write this. We have ordered chicken chow mein, gyoza and some cali and twist rolls. 

I really don't know why I keep coming here. This place has the worst service I've seen. Right now I'm watching the waitress watch the tv. This is the same waitress who flat out forgot our main dish last time. She brought us the check with it on there and didn't even apologize. 

Any way, this time it came out right away. Maybe she remembered last time. I haven't been here in so long and now I know why. The chow mein was fine but the gyoza came out cold!! I almost sent it back but since I've been here almost an hour with still no sushi, I was starving and ate it any way.  If the waitress was actually waiting instead of watching tv maybe it would have come right after it was done cooking.

Eventually the sushi did come out. It is just so so. I'm not sure if that is just how it goes when you try to get sushi in Arizona or not. I have found much better in Colorado (go Hapa!) and that is land locked as well, so I'm not sure if that's the reason sushi here is no good.

Honestly, I wouldn't waste your time with this place. I'm not sure if they even know how bad it has become. Hopefully they get the hint soon because I haven't found any asian food places on this side of town."}
{"text":"This restaurant was friendly, fast, and reasonably priced.  I will definitely be back for more.  

We both had the sushi...  The sushi menu had several ingredients that were sort of unusual.  Tomato and mozzeralla come to mind.  I asked for a vegetarian sushi roll other than the basic veggie roll on the menu, and they made me one with avocado, fried tofu, and cream cheese which was fantastic!  Really, really good.  the rolls were all pretty big with great ingredients.  If I can tear myself away from sushi next time I might try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"One word sums up my experience with this place and is reason enough for me to never return...ROACH! Yup, that's right...ROACH. We were eating a full meal at the bar last night when all of sudden \"someone\" decided to join us by making a mad dash between all of our plates. And then he decided to hang around and watch a little TV. We notified the owner/server, who said \"oh, sorry\" and proceeded to squish the uninvited visitor with a napkin, like it was nothing out of the ordinary. To add insult, she didn't even offer to take anything off our $50 tab. Not that we would have returned, but it's just the right thing to do. The food is good, but when you've got roaches joining you for dinner -- good simply is not enough. Ugghhh!"}
{"text":"My friend, Sarah, and I went here. It turns out the Sushi Chef used to work in Sapporo in Scottsdale. He (Sushi Chef) left and worked for the owner of Pan Asia. I like it because Pan Asia 

1 - Owned by a Jap/Chinese guy. Chef is from a Sapporo. So they have both experiences and Asian cultural. 

2 - We went there on Tuesday night at 6 pm. The restaurant is half full. So it is an \"okay\" busy for a new sushi restant on a week day.  Can you image if it on the weekend?! It would be busy.  And the reason I want to point out is the busier the sushi restaurant gets, the more fresh fish they are going to have :) 

Over all, I love it."}
{"text":"Was enticed to have dinner here when one of the owners mentioned that on the 14th and 28th of this month the restaurant features 50% off.  Don't know if this is every month... I thought it would be 50% off everything on the menu, but upon arrival was given a menu with a few items that are 50% or almost 50% off.  I asked her if they use rice wine vinegar for their sushi rice, and she said yes.  I was quite hopeful to see if they've improved on it!

The restaurant was busy, and there were at least three sushi chefs busily working the sushi bar.  I usually try to dine at sushi counters of Japanese restaurants, but the seats here are too low for me to enjoy the experience.  Measuring at 5'0\", I know I'm a shrimp, but the counter here is too low for ANYONE to be able to watch the chefs in action, so after trying one more time to sit there tonight, I got up immediately and sat at the bar.

After studying the menus and asking questions, I finally settled on the Norway Pepper Salmon (reg. $5, now $3) and The Bomb (reg. $15, now $9).  The restaurant was quite busy- it took at least 25 minutes before the two-piece salmon sushi arrived.  The presentation was quite pretty, with an orchid and a couple of sauces (pineapple and raspberry) for garnishes, but the sauces did not add anything to the flavor of the salmon.  I was quite hopeful that the rice would be much better this time- I met another owner, John, who told me that he'd read a review on a blog where the reviewer mentioned something about the rice.  However, the rice tasted just like it did on my second visit.  He did come by to inquire about the rice and said he'd try to find out what the problem was.

Since I found \"The Bomb\" (35 minutes or more wait-time) under the the Sushi/Rolls menu (the description stated \"baked spicy scallop with salmon wrapped spicy tuna\"), I expected to see rice in this dish, but the presentation was neither in sushi- nor hand-roll fashion, just said ingredients.  No matter- I still enjoyed it- so many textures here!  I loved the plumpness of the scallops.  I particularly liked how they weren't chopped into tiny pieces like I've experienced them in other venues.  I didn't find the tuna to be spicy at all.  It was, however, served tartare-style, and so added another textural component to the dish.  The salmon pieces were beautiful to behold and sliced thick, yet were velvety-smooth on the tongue and melted in my mouth!  Very fresh-tasting; no fishy aftertaste at all.

I also ordered the Pan Asia Beefsteak and Grilled Salmon entree under the Chinese menu (reg. $26, now $13) to go.  While I detected cornstarch in the sauces that covered them, I did find the couple of beef pieces, nicely peppered, and the sliver of salmon I tasted to be delicious!  Definitely something worth checking out on the 50% price-plan.  I did find it strange that this entree didn't come with rice, either; instead, orange slices were wedged between the salmon and the beef.  

BTW, I was able to taste a little bit of the green tea ice cream served here... it is EXQUISITE!  I was tempted to order some for take-out...  From what I gathered, the dessert costs $6 and is served with a warmed banana, a sauce, and whip cream.  A single scoop will set you back $4."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before. I've been here twice and had delicious plates. I tried the Orange Chicken and Sweet & Sour Pork Chops. Both plates had good size chicken pieces, pork with fresh green peppers, onions, carrots and pineapples. To me the Orange Chicken should taste like that. When I ordered the sweet & sour pork chops the waitress came back and said you know its a pok chop. Ummm... Yeah, thats why I orderd it. Imagine country fried steak, thats what the pork chop looked like. My sis let me try one of her Spicy Tuna Sushi, which was spicy, for me.

The environment is very modern, low light settings (gives off an intimate vibe of privacy.), table space will used and the bathroom sinks are cool."}
{"text":"Check the happy hour!  Calamari have a good sauce! Great taste for veg's chow mein! I will go back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, and slightly better than mediocre service.  We went here last week for our first time in at least six months and it was pretty much the same as before, but with a different server and slightly less creative plating of the rolls.  Pan Asia is pretty much the same as any other sushi bar, but more family friendly and generally lacking in good drink specials."}
{"text":"The AC went out that morning so it was a little warm in there but the food was still really good.  I asked the server if they could make a special request, they actually had something very close to what I wanted and their version was actually better. I will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"This place recently opened, it is clear Pan Asia knows what they are doing... I have only been here once, but so far the only thing i question is how they can offer such great quality/quantity for the prices on the menu (low).  It doesn't seem like that can last...hopefully they don't read this and come to their senses...

I had the lunch special sushi roll (it's simply called 'A' on the menu) with eel roll, salmon and spicy tuna roll which  came with soup and ginger salad with great dressing, it was ALOT of food, and everything was great."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to downgrade my two original glowing reviews for some time now and just haven't had the heart/time to do it. I've been back to Pan Asia probably 3-4 times and each time I feel like I'm climbing up a hill that's getting progressively muddier. And no one at Pan Asia seems to throw me a lifeline, or even notice that I (they?) are slipping BIG-TIME. 

Sushi fish that used to be fresh no longer is, Chinese food that used to be a few steps up from take out is now barely passable (the fried rice is notably disgusting), drinks now take forever to be delivered, the gap between the sushi and Chinese delivery has grown into a chasm and worst of all, the service is schizo and un-apologetically so. I shouldn't have to make it look like I'm going to walk out without paying to get someone to come to my table. 

Pan Asia owners/managers, this is my advice to you: Stop focusing on creating a thousand different confusing specials (Who can keep track of things like \"Chinese is 30% if you come between 5:15 and 5:30 but only if you take it to go after purchasing a drink at the bar\"?!) and trying to be everything to everyone and go back to your roots. Produce quality sushi and hot entrees that are well-timed and focus on giving great service, and then people like us (who actually are willing to pay full price for food) won't be so damn turned off."}
{"text":"Our go-to sushi spot. South Phoenix isn't the first place most think of for sushi, so we consider ourselves lucky we've got Pan Asia in our back yard.

Recommend the spicy chicken wings and any of the sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Nice treat for Saturday lunch with big 50% off menu. A lot of the sushi is fried or with cream cheese but they totally accommodated my special orders in effort to eat healthy.  If you drink ginger martini's are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and wanted sushi, but noooo way! Way overpriced compared to their lunch menu. Ended up ordering Chinese food instead. It was pretty good and cheap. My only complaint was that they gave the smallest scoop of rice. Couldn't they tell I was half Asian? I need a scoop of rice with every bite I take! LOL! Definitely go during lunch for the sushi bento deals."}
{"text":"Drive past here a few times a week, thought I'd give it a go. I've decided that their Chinese food is really good... their Japanese food, not so much. I ordered a chicken dish and my friend got some sushi. My chicken was very good, the sushi was alright. Nothing special and it took a very long time. If you go here, I recommend skipping the sushi on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I were thrilled when this place first opened. Initially the place had great energy and very outgoing staff. Most have left unfortunately. We have occasionally been back at least a few times a year.  Tonight's visit was pretty typical and reminds us that it's a local neighborhood eatery for a quick meal when we don't feel like cooking but there's a lot better options if we're willing to drive 20 minutes.  Service is decent but dishes can be \"hit or miss.\"  Tonight the seafood dish my mom ordered contained mushy squid and krab but the shrimp was ok.  My tofu dish was fine and my wife's noodle dish was ok. 
Happy hour prices offer a couple dollars off if you select from it but there are other Asian happy hours that really save you $."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Bad service, gave them a 2nd chance, only to be disappointed. The staff lacks knowledge of the menu, the food is subpar for the outrageous prices you pay, and they can't even get an order right. After 2 occasions in a span of a year, they definitely are under poor management. Don't go to this place."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood favorite for me!  The food is quick, inexpensive and really good!  It's not some high end \"froo froo\" sushi joint, so factor that into your expectations.  But for sushi on the southside, it's great!  If you can get there for lunch, they have some good bento box options.  They also have 50% off select food items all day on Saturdays!  How can you beat that?  Kenny, my favorite server, is a delight!

BTW, they also serve chinese food, but I've never ordered it, so I can't tell you whether it's good or not."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try Pan Asia for some time now, but didn't get around to it until last night, and I am glad we did.  Location is great for us as it's on the way home and has lots of parking.  The dinning area is comfortable and not crowded at all. The food was very good and I look forward to trying more of the dishes they offer."}
{"text":"So after not dining here in a couple months, I decided to give it another chance and took my sister for sushi. 

Such a horrible idea, complete waste of money. 

We ordered 5 rolls between us. The vegas roll (which is usually pretty good) was soggy, the lisa lisa roll was much too sweet, one of the other rolls was fishy and all of them were falling apart. They put everything on one plate, so half the rolls were covered in the sweet sauces from the lisa lisa, it did not mesh well at all.

It also took a good 25 minutes to get our sushi, when there were only 2 other parties in the whole place. 

On the up side, we actually got a waiter who wasn't absolutely horrible. He wasn't good enough to make up for the meal though."}
