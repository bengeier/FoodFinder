{"text":"i love the grilled shrimp salad?and the grilled shellfood plate. All cooked well. foods are fresh?Servers are very nice with smily face. Just perfect service."}
{"text":"We sampled the Calgary Taste menu which was good, some dishes were hits, some not so much. I loved the atmosphere in here of being able to watch the kitchen. Made things interesting, however, the wait for the food seemed longer as I stared at the delicious orders coming out. 

The food was good, the drinks were expensive, the food was expensive, and since I had the Calgary Taste menu, it was at a lower price for 4 or 5 courses, so I can't comment on whether or not the regular menu was worth the dime. I did not get the chance to have some oysters, which felt like a sin when I was there, but I promise to next time. The menu looked delicious, so returning is a must."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. Tried a new grain, Quinoa, and found it quite tasty. The savory halibut was served with a smoked tomato salad, which had a most unique and enjoyable flavor. We topped it all off with a S'mores Bread Pudding for dessert.  And while it didn't taste like either smores or bread pudding to me, it was, nonetheless, delicious."}
{"text":"A nice seafood restaurant with a good wine list. Our server was outstanding. The food was very good and they were willing to do a little mixing and matching in terms of the sides that came with the dishes. 

I would certainly go here again."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were dreadful. The batter was sopped in grease, the fish was dry, the fries were cold dregs, and the pathetic thimble sized slaw was an ugly yellow brown colour. There wasn't a shred of imagination nor love in the meal. Absolutely pathetic unprofessional effort, and the waitress was snotty! The only thing high end was the price. I'll give it one more shot, maybe in a few months, but wow, what a pathetic excuse for an oyster bar. Don't order the fish and chips!"}
{"text":"As I do in new cities I move to, I wanted to try out the top ten restaurants in Calgary...This was my second restaurant in the top ten, and I am blown away by everything here.

I tweeted about my excitement of going there with a friend, and when we sat down in the Oyster bar (in a booth) they came right over and offered the \"tweeters\" some Prosseco to start our dinner off.  Well, happy girl, I LOVE sparkling...

We ordered some oysters (comes with a Mignonette, hot sauce, lemon or horseradish) soo you get to pick your poison.  I would suggest skipping the east coast Oysters, the West Coast were WAY WAY better.  

The scallop appetizer was something else we tried, and it was pretty good, came with some swiss chard salad (not sure the appropriate name but it was soo good)

For main courses, my friend ordered the Piri-Piri crusted Tuna, and it had a fantastic mix of veggies with it.  Nice and meaty Tuna, but the meal was pretty light which I loved.

I ordered the King Crab and Snow Crab combo, and we shared both our meals...Takes forever to eat crab, but it was worth the effort, that's for sure.

Dessert we had some Sancerre, with their individual apple pie...DO NOT order it for one person, it's WAY too big :)

Everything blew me away......  :)

I want to go back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"We dined here before making our way to the East Village for the Mikado. It was a beautiful evening so we sat on the patio (Stephen Ave. people watching). We each had a glass of rose wine and it was perfect for a hot day.

We shared a dozen oysters - 1/2 west coast and 1/2 east coast. They were fantastic, and although I don't usually like sauces on my oysters - they were so tasty I ended up dipping my bread into the mango sauce. MMMM.

My husband had the fish and chips. The chips were 'pomme frite' french style and were very good, but he felt the fish was all batter and very little fish. The plate was a little light on the coleslaw too.

I ordered the smoked fried chicken which came with chorizo gravy that was so good I could have eaten it as a main dish, and it was the perfect thing to dip my hubby's fries into.  The plate comes with a stack of corn fritters/hushpuppies in a smoky honey drizzle.  I really enjoyed my meal, but felt the portion of corn fritters was a bit too much. I shared with hubby, but would have preferred 1 or 2 just to taste if I was dining alone.

I would definitely go back again for the oysters & chicken, which is weird because I assumed I would have fish as I usually try to eat the house specialty.

Food - 7/10
Service - 10/10
Atmosphere - 9/10

Question: Is it wrong to love fried chicken so much? It's my fave meal since childhood."}
{"text":"Well being in a landlocked city, our selection of quality seafood restaurants are rather limited.

Before we begin, there are actually two parts to Catch. One being the Oyster bar on the main floor (which I am reviewing) and the other being the more formal dining room upstairs. I haven't been upstairs in quite a while so I don't think it will be fair for me to review until I visit again.

The ambience in the oyster bar is very casual mimicking the dock side restaurants one would discover at costal cities around North America with nautical and maritime decorations surrounding an open kitchen. There's a mix of booths, pub and normal tables, and bar seating available with a couple of televisions strategically placed around the bar area. The restaurant is attached to the Hyatt hotel so you will find a fair number of travellers on a given night.

Service wise, the staff is fantastic in many ways being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Don't have much to add about that.

Food - this is the important part isn't it? Fan of oysters will find a selection of 6-10 types from both the east and west coast though I personally prefer the eastern variety. If you are unsure what to order, speak to your server and they will guide you through the difference and make suggestions. Oysters are served shucked on an iced fill platter accompanied by a trio of sauces (names escape my mind at this moment but I will find out).

Beside oysters, Catch reels in some of the best tasting seafood in Calgary using simple yet complimentary flavours. You will find anything from Digby scallops, Mahi Mahi, BC Salmon, Sword Fish, to a beer battered Fish & Chips all prepared in the open kitchen.

Other Comments:
Wine selection is on par but somewhat on the pricey side for a comparable bottle at other restaurants.

Dessert menu changes frequently and is recommended!

Look for updates as I tend to visit Catch regularly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Catch in ages and pretty much the only time I would go was for the Oyster & Champagne special they had running for awhile.  I went their for a lunch meeting this week and was looking forward to checking out their lunch menu.  

We tried and shared 4 different appetizers and were pleasantly surprised with all of them.  We had scallops, prawns, squid, and octopus.  Absolutely fresh and delicious.  The highlight was definitely the octopus which I had no idea could be so savoury and fresh.  The wine we had was also great.  Our server was very attentive but not annoying.  She refilled waters and coffees at just right the moment.  

All in all, it was a great lunch for a seafood lover."}
{"text":"After reading the rest of the reviews I wonder if we went to the same place!!? 

I finally got the opportunity to have dinner at Catch and had high hopes for a wonderful meal of seafood - instead I got lack lustre service and an even more disappointing culinary experience. Things did not get off to a great start, although they do have a great wine list, ordering a cocktail before dinner proved to be quite challenging: no crantini, no Bellini, and no Lemonhart and no Stella! We finally found 4 cocktails that would work & ordered, even after all that we still had to send back one of the cocktails! 

We did have lots of time to ponder the menu as we waited for our server, and waited...and waited the cocktails were done, the bread was finished off and we were eager to order our starters and our main course but the waiter was no where to be found. 

Once our meals arrived we \"dived\" in but the food experience was underwhelming to say the least - the lobster risotto was more paste like than creamy and lacked flavour, it was topped with half a lobster (slightly chewy) and served without a hint of a vegetable, definitely not worth the price..$49.00 The tuna was under cooked to the point that the fish wasn't just pink in the middle but still cold to the touch when it arrived, our friends fared slightly better, finding their dishes adequate but by no means at the level they had expect given the $$ and the reputation of this establishment. 

All in all a big disappointment won't be back and won't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We went to Catch and we had the fish and chips one weekend and it was alright, but i found the selection to be a bit off. Having some chardonnay was a good pairing but would have preferred a chenin blanc. I want to try this place again, maybe i can get a better opinion the second time around.

{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday and friends came along.  Service was okay, but a bit slow or inattentive at times.  The seafood tower was reasonably priced and was okay in taste/quality.  The scallop appetizer and the fish and lobster entrees were also okay but definitely not worth the price for how small the portions and average tasting they were according to my friends.  The restaurant atmosphere is nice.  When I made the reservation they asked if it was for a special occasion and I told them it was my wife's birthday.  But at dinner they clearly did not make a note of that.  I had to advise our server that it was my wife's birthday and the server was nice enough to bring out a complimentary birthday slice of cake.  Also had an issue with my bill being charged the wrong amount and not corrected properly after advising the server, so had to have my credit card company adjust the charge to the correct amount after."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Calgary. Comes with a price but worth it for the special occasion if its not quiet in your budget, Loved the scallops"}
{"text":"I'm happy that Calgary has some restaurants that have a kitchen that puts effort into what it prepares. Front of house, however, left a lot do desire. While Calgary is a rip off when it comes to low-end meals, we get VERY good value for high end restaurants like this. For dinner, my partner and I had jalapeno+bacon stuffed oysters as an appetizer (AMAZING) to start. My partner got a very fresh pasta and I got a loaded tuna sandwich. The quality was stellar. We didn't get anything to drink, and our meal cost $55 + tip. In Toronto, this would cost double, despite being 4 hours closer to the East coast than us.

The servers are indeed pretty detached, mediocre, and lazy. While ours was nice and obviously meant well, she was pretty rude as a result of what seems to be non-existent training and or experience. She was hard to find, but when she did come around, she would swiftly take ambiguously finished plates from us swiftly without asking. My friend wanted her pasta packed, but our conversation distracted her from asking. Our server was also not very helpful in settling our debate about the difference between Crab and Lobster, stating \"actually, you know what? I do not know the difference between the two.\" Are you fucking kidding me? A server at Calgary's premier seafood restaurant does not know the difference between their two most prestigious (and expensive) dishes? I just changed my rating from 4 to 3 stars.

EXCEPTIONAL food, but my god, I need to move to a city that has cheap labor."}
{"text":"One of our vendors was holding an after conference shindig here and I was looking forward to it all day!

The back part of the restaurant was sectioned off for the event with a few standing only tables scattered about. Two seafood platter towers were waiting to be devoured - overflowing with lobster, snow crab, oysters mussels, clams and peel & eat shrimp. YUM! Their famous wonton crusted tempura prawns, calamari and chicken spring rolls were in heavy rotation being served by their friendly staff. 

Everything was delicious - it was a bit difficult to eat lobster standing up though. (I'm sure if you're at Catch for a meal, you'll be sitting down!)

It was starting to get busy (from people joining the event plus people dining in the main part of the restaurant) that it was getting profusely hot. We ended up leaving earlier than we wanted - but we had to cool off outside (and head to our next after conference party).

I will definitely be back for a proper sit down meal, there's a lot of things I wanna try off the menu - and with all the positive reviews they have I'm sure I won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to Catch with two girlfriends for a celebratory night out.  I can't say anything but good things about the food, but the evening took an abrupt turn for the worse when the waiter cut us off after one bottle of wine split between three people.  We thought there must have been some mistake since there was no evident reason to do this.  We were so shocked. One bottle might have lasted us through the dining experience had the wait for food not been so lengthy.  We were left to finish our meal without wine, and left without dessert.  Our experience turned from celebratory to a bad taste in our mouths.  Visiting Catch was the lowest point of the weekend for us, and I am still at a loss as to why they would have cut us off.  I was so offended, I was debating getting up and walking out without paying.  Thinking about the situation now still upsets me."}
{"text":"this place is great!
service is always good and knowledgable!

the peel and eat shrimp is amazing!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets with respect to preparation and execution.  Something left to be desired with the dining room atmosphere at lunch time... generic round table white tablecloth.  That said, food is excellent and I'm sure by evening the atmosphere livens up.  I will have to enjoy a dinner here before I can give it a perfect rating but they are on the right track."}
{"text":"Lunch downtown can be a challenge some days especially when you have to change your reservations last minute to another venue. We chose Catch (upstairs) because it was the only place that had availability for the time and size that we needed. 

None of us have been there before and to be honest we all were kind of apprehensive of what it would be like but it turned out to be quite a good experience.

As we trekked up the stairs to the restaurant I was impressed at what I saw. Bright red booths lined one side of the restaurant and tables filled the rest. It looked welcoming and fancy which I am sure is what they are going for. 

Once we sat down we were handed an iPad with the wine list, I thought this was pretty cool. One of my coworkers noticed that the beer selection was lacking however.

After giving the lunch menu a good look (there isn't that many items to choose from compared to the menu in the oyster bar downstairs) I ordered the beet salad to start. It came out looking like a piece of art and was just the right amount for a starter... it was also super tasty.

For my main lunch item I ordered the Shrimp Salad Sandwich it was very light and full of flavour. The only thing I didn't like was the bread it was on. I found it to be very hard and crunchy, so much so that the baby shrimp filling just fell out, but let me tell you this... I am still thinking about how good this sandwich tasted!

I want to defiantly come back and try more things on the menu, perhaps for dinner!"}
{"text":"The English guy working the check-in desk is a bit of an asshole (just rude and condescending)- but everyone else that works at Catch was really nice- especially the bartender.
I sat at the bar and had some chowder and the Oyster Banh Mi. It was a terrific lunch.
They do sell seafood to go, if you'd like to cook it at home. Weird- but I think it's kind of cool too."}
{"text":"If this is Calgary's best, the others must be dismal. Although sporting an impressive and reasonably priced wine list, the food misses the mark. The salmon ravioli appetizer was innovative and well done, the highlight of the evening. The carppaccio was bland and uninspired. The catch of the day, monkfish tasted metallic and was grossly over salted an opinion shared by all the guests. The sable fish was undercooked and served luke warm. The desserts present no threat to Sara Lee, the chocolate caramel cake being dry and lacking any hint of caramel. The cheesecake rivalled that served at the cheesecake factory. The service compensated for the poor showing of the menu items and the ambiance was good."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special and the service was not good. They never cleared our table after the oysters or drink glasses that were done. Had to ask what the special was after the waitress asked us to order three times. I must be spoiled with grilled oysters in Houston because the grilled oysters here were terrible."}
{"text":"We just finished a wonderful dinner on the main floor, seafood infused! The main level is world's apart from the upper fine dining level. We vowed never to eat upstairs again last year due to terrible service and a different menu that did not have great offerings.
H - you are a terrific server, we felt most of the time that you were there just for us. You were ever present and always clearing our table, etc.
We dined on clam chowder (Fridays on sale for $7 a bowl as opposed to the reg. $10).
We also had calamari that was well prepared, tried some oysters that tasted just like the sea. Divine. And the side order of scallops. Yum, fresh, everything and served hot when it needed to be and cold when it needed to be.
Atmosphere was ok, strange mix of music. Spanish, reggae, classical.
One note - the manager at the front in the suit hovering at the hostess stand - we would have loved it if you interacted with your guests a bit. Feedback makes you all that much better and you would have learned how much we loved our food and our server.
Parking - validated at the Hyatt. Nice. 
Great location on Stephen Ave and you can go for a stroll after dinner to work off all that food!
We did not partake in dessert but they had good selections here, all made in house.
For sure, we will return even if just to sit at the bar, have oysters and watch the action in the open kitchen!!! (CASH ONLY for me for this restaurant, see below)

One additional star taken off our experience because when I got home, I checked my bank account on line and saw that Catch had overcharged my Visa account by quite a bit from what was on my receipt. This is how their system works and you have to wait days to see the Visa posting that you are actually charged what you authorized them to charge. Very silly system and found myself making several calls/e-mails to straighten this out. Unnecessary action on my part and I am sure I am not the only one having to deal with this hassle. Visa does not know why they overcharge initially either.)"}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant for lunch once a month. It's a fairly high class establishment, with a more casual feel on the first floor, and a more formal feel on the second floor. The oysters are first class. East and west are a good choice, although I wasn't a fan of the \"New Zealand\" ones. ( too big)

The ravioli consome is really good.   You don't always need a reservation but one is recommended as we have missed it a few times, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I recently went to Catch (AFTER RENOVATIONS) and boy does it look different from what I remembered. Catch is now separate from the hotel and has an updated, modern decor. For some of you who don't know, Catch is comprised of their Oyster Bar which is now on the main floor for a more casual dining experience; and a Fine Dining restaurant portion upstairs. 

My friend and I decided to have dinner at their Oyster Bar which had a relaxed, modern feel to it with navy blue and warm hues of brown all around. There are booths all along the left side when you walk in, and a lovely open kitchen. There is also a little area close to the front where you can sit and watch them shuck your oysters.

Our server was patient, which I appreciated because I can be so indecisive. She was friendly and asked us if we had any questions on the menu. After comparing menus with the Fine Dining restaurant upstairs, the Oyster Bar may be more feasible (around $25+ for a main) - with a choice of oysters, mussels, seafood soups and salads, pasta, shrimp, risotto, and daily specials.  They have more expensive items such as 1.25 lbs Atlantic lobster, King crab, and steak. Beers at $8 a pint, and wine by the glass at $10+.

First up, we ordered their House Made West Coast Dungeness Crab Cakes with a chili aioli ($20). It came with three, no bigger than a ping pong sized crab cakes that had a crispy exterior. They were over-seasoned and the texture was off-putting since it was chewy and tough to eat. On the bright side there was a decent amount of crab and very little filler. The chili aioli had a light pleasant, lemony taste to it. 

We went on a Tuesday and had their daily special of $2 tempura prawns which was a pretty good deal. The prawn was fairly large - but was thickly coated in batter (kind of a mix of tempura and something else) and rolled around in deep fried noodles or something. It looked like a fried hairy prawn. Despite that, it was seasoned well, super crunchy, not oily, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. It came with the chili aoili. 

I couldn't leave here without trying their oysters and at $3.50/each, $18 (half a dozen) and $36 (dozen) I was expecting a mouth orgasm. Alas, like most oysters in Calgary, I was disappointed. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. They came with freshly grated horse radish, a thin chipotle cocktail sauce of some sort, and another vinegar-like sauce. I would have preferred just a lemon and tabasco, but the sauce enhanced the flavors of the oysters in a way. We had a dozen of various East and West oysters. I personally didn't enjoy the East Coast oysters as much, which had a salty, grimy, fishy after taste to them that I didn't enjoy. I like my oysters with a smoother finish.

For my main dish I ordered their oven baked line caught Alaskan Sable Fish ($23) that came with the Chef's daily selection of sides. I think this is an amazing deal compared to what you would get at a chain restaurant in terms of quality. Today it came with a butternut squash puree, barley, and bok choi. When it came out, the presentation was exquisite! Picture perfect. The fish had a really strong miso paste on top which was terrible and took away from the natural taste of the fish. Other than that, the rest of the dish was divine. The fish was cooked perfectly - super moist, flaked easily with a fork, and melted like butter in my mouth. Their butternut squash puree was my second favourite thing on the dish. Had a bright orange colour, and the texture was silky, rich, and creamy. Overall, the dish is fantastic and I highly suggest you get this fish. Either that, or cod is another fantastic choice for a white fish. Skip the salmon!

Overall, Catch's Oyster Bar (not sure of their Fine Dining menu) is a hit! The mood is perfect for a date or dinner with friends, and the food is pretty good. Yes... It is pricey, but the quality of the fish and the preparation and care that goes into the dish makes up for it. Sure there were some lows in my meal (like the crab cakes) but Catch Oyster Bar is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"An overpriced tourist trap! 

Hardly the benchmark foodie establishment it was when it opened.

Beware Hyatt guests -- there is a world of good service and good food waiting to be discovered just steps from your hotel.  Try the James Joyce, or Palomino, or one of the many other restaurants nearby.   Do not stumble into this C dressed up as an A.

The food was of good quality, but incredibly slow.  Even for the raw oysters!

The servers are inexperienced and the managers are thuggish. 
*Knuckles on table \"I hear you have a problem?\"

You will be treated like dirt if you don't have a reservation. And even if you do make one they might 'misplace' it -- so your loss.

Despite mentioning we were on our way to an event that evening, they didn't bother bring us our bill once we were finished dining.

We paid on our way out and were late for our show."}
{"text":"Worst management I have ever experienced. How is it that a group makes a reservation but still has to wait over an hour to get a table and then continue to seat other tables in front of us. We will never go to this place again. Sad for the big taste yyc to have such a poor restaurant in the group."}
{"text":"Whee! I went here for happy hour. My co-worker took me out. I ordered a dozen fresh oysters, $6 prosecco and $6.00 beers. The oysters were good and the server each very well. She also was kind enough to not recommend the house wine. You know it must be bad if the server won't recommend it. I appreciated the tip.

My friend ordered a halibut burger and a killer house salad with lots of cheese, homemade croutons and bacon. She was happy with it.

Catch is a little out of my price range, but for happy hour, it's my kind of place."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary.   I wanted something special but not too formal.   Located in the Hyatt, they were fantastic about everything.  We booked reservations a week earlier for the Saturday (they aren't open on Sundays) and the only complaint we had was parking.   We ended up parking away because the parking lot was full. So we parked down underneath Jack Singer and Plus fifteened  it to the hotel ... about a 5 minute walk.   The parking for The Catch and their Oyster bar is complimentary,  if you can get into the lot.

The service was excellent.   We booked through Open Table and the restaurant called to confirm that we would be keeping our reservation for the date and time and I mentioned it was our anniversary, so yes we would.   As a result we were served complimentary bubbly .. a dry Italian Presecco that was quite nice and fooled me into believing it was a Cuvee!   Naughty little wine.   

 Since we're eating healthy,  my date (aka the long suffering husband)  chose a Caesar Salad with Pancetta and I chose the orange cranberry salad.  We each had a dozen fresh raw oysters with the accompanying sauces.   Served on the half shell with crushed ice and small chilled sauce containers dug into that ice made for an excellent presentation and kept our oysters nice and cool while we finished our salads.   Delicious.   The New Zealand,  PEI and Nova Scotian Oysters were fresh and fabulous with each of the sauces and just enough to leave room for dessert!

Our server explained a little about each type and even showed us how the oyster shells indicated farming or not!   After a glass of Presecco  we ordered a lovely Canadian Pinot Gris I'll be buying again.   The wine list was on a tablet, and was quite elegant.   It is not listed on their website, so after a bit of a search .... Sandhill Pinto Grigio was light, easy to drink and sold by the glass and went perfectly with the oysters.

The dessert was served in small mason style jars and topped with fresh berries and a white chocolate triangle.    Chocolate cheesecake for Him and chocolate licorice pudding for Her.    Lovely.     And the decaf coffee didn't taste like decaf, it was wonderful!

I would not recommend this place for families with children,  there is very little on the menu that young (unless they're very precocious and love raw seafood) children would like.   The ambience is very adult and yes, you can wear your designer jeans there, in fact two of our waitresses were wearing jeans!  

The Catch also has a 'buy fresh fish'  service.   It would be fresh, if the oysters were any ndication, but it has to be pre-ordered, so planning a meal and  *Evil Wicked Grin*  parking is going to be considered when making such a purchase.

My Dearly Beloved is looking forward to trying The Catch upstairs for next year's anniversary.

In the meantime,  I'm glad we visited the Oyster Bar!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Catch - I've never had a bad meal here. Great service and atmosphere, along with a good selection of wines.  If you're going to visit Catch, the Oysters Rockefeller are a must-have!"}
{"text":"Fantastic seafood restaurant in the middle of cow country.  The bar is a great place to sit if you're by yourself - watching oyster shucking turns out to be very entertaining.  The oysters themselves were nice, as was the bouillabaisse.  I'll definitely return on my next visit to Calgary."}
{"text":"It is one of my favorite places in Calgary. Tuna tartar and scallops appetizer is the best. Great main course selections and cocktails. Highly recommend to check out the place for dinner."}
{"text":"Had a good experience at Catch this evening. We started with cooked oysters (first time I've ever had them cooked) and now I can finally say I really like oysters! These ones were covered in breading and fried and laid back in their shells with a layer of spinach. It was a delicious appetizer! I had the sablefish with broccolini and squash and it was to die for. Perfectly cooked, tender and juicy sablefish with delicious sautéed broccolini and squash. I loved my dish! My dining companions had the sablefish as well and one had the tuna and also said it was quite good. Amidst a sea of steakhouses, Catch is a delightful respite. Decent wine selection and pretty good service make it a definite 4/5."}
{"text":"Went to catch for a leisurely lunch.  The service was impeccable, professional and efficient.  And the food was spectacular, beautiful presentation and the taste never lets you down here.  A dozen oysters with a brilliant yellow mignonette that tasted like maybe mustard, pepper, and vinegar, plus a nice tangy sweet and sour one with shallots, both excellent.
albacore tuna salad was fresh with green beans and lovely olives, cherry tomatoes, potatoes and artichoke hearts. smoked salmon appetizer with fried capers was good too.  hubby had the manitoba pickeral, a much underrated fish, and the brown butter with almonds made it ethereal.
even got a glimpse of chef kyle groves as it was end of shift."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood, only been in the lounge area, but worth going!

Try the tower of lesser power and you will be impressed.

My cousin, Brad Horen, used to be one of the head chefs here - he is one of the best in Canada."}
{"text":"Make a reservation to eat upstairs.  The food is pretty amazing but small portions for those not used to it. The service is personable and knowledgeable but the food comes slowly. It takes time to make high class meals. So if you need your meals in a hurry than save catch for a night when you have time to enjoy your meal as it comes. Downstairs is an oyster bar.  They have an extensive list of oysters from the east and west coast and they have a larger list of oysters than what's on menu they give you. To see more oyster species ask for the ones not listed. Keep in mind Catch is very expensive and is probably a once a year visit. Also if you eat downstairs you won't like catch much. I find the food on the menu downstairs bland and sometimes not good especially for the price. The only way to eat at catch is to go to the upstairs restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to the  Oyster Bar last night for the oyster special (6 for 13 dollars) and the oysters were simply great. The staff were so nice, and I enjoyed just sitting with the oysters right in front of me, which many people might find a bit strange. I love oysters, but I do not partically care for the large pacific oyster, raw, for some reason the milky texture is just not for me. Catch did have one variety of them for those that enjoy their distictive flavor, but they had four varieties that I thought were simply delicious. The staff provided me and my friends the ingredients to make our own special sauce, since I was with my son and  his friend  that is a chef in Cabo San Lucas."}
{"text":"* This review is for the lower (i.e. oyster bar) segment of the restaurant.

Are you looking for...

Reasonable portions?
More bang for your buck?
Booths?

If you answered YES to any of the above questions, then this is the WRONG restaurant for you.

The décor is rustic - it possesses a charming depth, reminiscent of a cozy pub with modern accents. However, I feel that having a ratio of (4 tables w/ chairs : 1 booth) isn't always welcoming; certain customers prefer a comfortable booth, laden with plush seats and back support. Unfortunately, my party and I were assigned to a very awkward corner with decrepit chairs whose legs became ensnared on uneven floorboards.

But I digress.

Ah, the food - what to say? The majority of the appetizers were decadent, savoury and simply delicious; the fried clams/oysters/scallops were incredible - my palate was definitely singing afterward. The oysters were amazing, save for one whose inner sanctum was tainted by sand - but that's okay, no harm done. 

The infamous experience of the evening were the crab cakes...or should I call them golf balls? They were roughly the same size, and quite possibly the same texture. The breading was atrocious; it was similar to grit. The meat was sinewy and very fishy (no pun intended). Upon inspecting the inside, I noticed that it was dungeness crab. Dungeness crab is typically very flaky and slightly sweet. However...! If it is of poor quality, dungeness crab can possess a stringy and slightly watery texture, and can have quite the potent fish taste. In my opinion, no self-respecting restaurant should use low quality crab in a cake. Please, obtain better quality dungeness crab or use a different species. 

To summarize: three golf ball sized crab \"cakes\" for twenty dollars? Please don't insult us. I do not recommending buying the crab cakes; you'll save yourself twenty dollars and a plate of disappointment. In general, a lot of appetizers and entrees were small. Call it \"nouvelle cuisine\", if you wish. In my opinion, it is too small, overpriced and not worth what you paid for.

I had the miniature cupcakes for dessert. Four out of six isn't too bad. The two vanilla cupcakes tasted like they came straight from the grocery store; dry cake, dry stale icing...overall, very unpleasant. The remaining cupcakes were heavenly, though!

Are you poor? Experiencing a bit of financial duress? I hope you didn't pay over two hundred dollars to discover that you can barely afford what you've eaten! I have to admit - this restaurant is very expensive. The quality of the food (oysters and other notable dishes exempt), is certainly nothing to brag about. I gave this restaurant a chance several years ago. I went to the upstairs level and did not enjoy the food, either. Upstairs or downstairs, it doesn't seem like anyone can win a truly wonderful dining experience here."}
{"text":"If you're craving super fresh seafood, this is the spot. I had their clams and mussel mix, forgot the dish name, but you can choose from a few different broths. Again, choose a few beers to sample. Canadians know how to brew great beers!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. Only one dish was okay out of 3. For a $$$ price tag I was expecting a fine dining experience. The scallops and gnocchi was the okay one and that was it. The lobster was tasteless, and the mussels were just bad."}
{"text":"Go straight for the goods, skip the happy hour gimmicks.

This place got my attention because of the happy hour special. $2 for an oyster plus $5 for a beer is really a deal so I walked in. 

The special deal wasn't too special because the oysters are below par.

Try the boiled lobster for to and it will absolutely blow you away. $65 could be a little bit pricey, but for the sweetness of a fresh nova scotia lobster with marinated potatoe plus clams and tasty seaweed, you will find the experience worth it."}
{"text":"Clearly aimed at the upscale downtown business crowd, this place resonates as the seafood stop for ballers in the core. Pricey but the food was excellent.  Parking in this area is terrible during the day but much better after 6pm."}
{"text":"Ummm... 5 stars in a hotel seafood joint... In land-bound Calgary? Yes. The culinary gods must be crazy.

So, one good thing about cheap jet fuel is that fresh seafood can be flown almost anywhere -fresh and tasty. Case in point: Catch.

 Located inside the Grand  Hyatt in downtown Calgary, Catch is a individually owned restaurant, not a chain! And it is worth a visit...

There are two dining areas: one upstairs is a more formal dining and the one downstairs in a pub area, sleek and cozy, with lots of leather booths and dark wood. That is where I sat.

I enjoyed a half dozen oysters from the East Coast: Caraquets and St. Simons.  They were superb and served with a lovely mignonette and fresh grated horseradish with a house hot sauce.

I followed up with the Thai noodle bowl which was a curry based shellfish and noodle dish that was in the most delicate coconut milk sauce, garnished with cilantro, and housing plenty of mussels, clams, shrimp and succulent fish bits.  Fabulous!

I also quite enjoyed the wine by the glass menu. This was quite a surprise coming from inside the hotel and I couldn't be more pleased! What a great little restaurant."}
{"text":"Sorry to say that the meal was very disappointing. The fish I ordered was dry and inedible, yet the server didn't inquire as to what the issue was with the food, just noted that I \"must be full\" even though I had one bite of my dinner.  My fiancé thought his scallops were palatable, but certainly not worth the price. We did not want to cause a fuss in the restaurant... but we will not be back and wouldn't recommend it, there are much better places in the city for seafood."}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh - and menu has great variety. Definitely a great seafood place although prices are definitely on the higher need. Crab cakes are great - nice and full of actual crab meat!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding.
Usually need a reservation but last night we were able to walk in and get a seat at the bar which was actually kind of neat because we saw all the oyster action.  The service was extremely attentive from both the bar and wait staff but not at all overbearing.  They came up with great recommendations and were more than happy to answer any questions that we had.
We enjoyed some oysters, mussels (in white wine with tomatoes).  My boyfriend had the mahi mahi and I enjoyed the scallops with crab ravioli dish.  All of it was fantastic.
The prices are on the higher end but pretty reasonable for the quality of food.  The atmosphere is lively but professional and really great for a nice dinner with friends or a romantic evening out."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price for what you get... Remember, it is a seafood restaurant landed locked in a metropolitan city, so one would think it might be a bit pricy. The staff was helpful and friendly, which, in Calgary, typically only happens when you're wearing a Rolex... I was/am definitely not!"}
{"text":"Oh Catch... I so wanted to just love this place. Alas, it was sub par at best. 

I came in and sat on the patio. It was Saturday afternoon and quite busy so I totally forgave the crazy slow service. When we finally got to order I ordered the halibut burger/sammie (somewhere in between a sandwich and a burger), when the order came out I clearly had the salmon burger. I had a few bites and while it was \"A-Ok\", I just really wanted to have the burger I ordered. After a while our waitress finally checked back in and asked how everything was, I let her know that I indeed had the wrong order, to her credit, even though it took her quite a while to check in, once she did she rectified it right away. Unfortunately one the halibut burger arrived, it wasn't much better. But, what was absolutely amazing - the side salad.... Seriously, best side salad I have EVER had!! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"For a special occasion, I booked a reservation at Catch Restaurant and Oyster Bar.  I chose the downstairs bar as I wanted a more relaxed environment.  It was a hopping atmosphere! Definitely happening.  It was a very busy Friday even so that we couldn't locate any nearby parking due to many holiday parties happening around the area.  They do have some complimentary self parking available at the Hyatt but they were already full.

As we were circling for quite sometime, we called the restaurant to advise them that we were running late due to lack of parking.  The person on the phone apologized and told us not to worry.  Once we arrived, the hostess was courteous and had our table ready.  Service was prompt and the server was very informative of their menu.  

We chose to get a bunch of items and share them (as per the server's suggestion):  selection of half-dozen oysters, calamari, clam chowder (special for the evening), crab cakes and the Thai Curry Shellfish Bowl.  ALL items were amazing!  I was amazed at how fresh the seafood was as well as loved the presentation of items.  

I'm told upstairs at Catch is quite pricey but I found our selection and bill for two reasonable for what we got.  I just wish I had enough room to try dessert! 

Not to worry ... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"As far as seafood in Alberta goes, Catch is among the best (if not the best). The oyster bar on the main floor has an \"upscale casual\" feel to it. It's relaxed, but still feels like you're in a somewhat fancy place.

The wine menu is extensive and the beer selection is decent.

The selection of fresh oysters is what really makes this place. The oysters taste almost as fresh as they would if you were actually on the east or west coast: no lemon or lime is necessary. Of course, just because it's not necessary doesn't mean it's not provided. Citrus, horseradish, a Saskatoon (I think) vinegrette and a  thin chipotle sauce (more like a jus) are your options for \"enhancing\" the flavour of your oysters. The chipotle sauce is especially excellent with the west coast oysters.

The food, beyond the oysters, is also excellent. I had the marlin with curried quinoa and it was outstanding. Certainly, it was the best fish I'd tasted in a long time. I think the only time I've had fish that was better prepared was at a small restaurant in Dawson City, YT whose name I can't recall.

The prices at Catch aren't exactly cheap -- seafood is rarely cheap in Alberta -- but the quality of the food makes the prices more than worth it.

I don't get down to Calgary very often, but Catch is now added to my list of \"must visits\" when I am in the city."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and it was ok.. I had the tuna salad and it was good, just a little overcooked for my taste, but it was ok. The service was friendly... I liked it and might go back to try the oysters..."}
{"text":"A friend and I were walking around one night and we thought this would be a good restaurant to try since the menu looked good and the patio was packed. It was a bit of a wait but we were seated at the patio which was great. 

After that, out waitress took forever to come by. When she finally came to get our drink orders we already knew what we wanted to order since we had been waiting for so long. 

Since this was a seafood restaurant I had high hopes but was thoroughly disappointed. I ordered the cod which was overcooked to begin with and then it was covered in a hot broth. It was just a weird combination and it was not appetizing. 

My friend ordered the mussels and she didn't even eat half of them. It was just really not special. 

Wish I had better things to say about this place but unfortunately I won't be coming back. It did not meet my expectations at all."}
{"text":"The entrance guy was not welcoming. Our waiter was kind and professional though. The steamed oysters were good. Fish and chips were so so. Generally, nice place to have seafood."}
{"text":"Expect high prices and little food, make sure you have some money left over to grab a pizza later to fill you up. Service is alright, ambience is ok nothing to brag about. I've order a seafood platter for myself and gf but was disappointed with how little food it had there. oysters, mussel, clams were very small. The tray had 90% ice 10% food. Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Amazing!
First off we were visiting Calgary, and looking for a quiet, romantic place to unwind from the long trip. Plus it was easy to get to since we were staying in the Hilton where they are located! 
Greeting by a very friendly waitress who showed us to the table .  She asked if we were familiar with Oysters.  We are, and a big fan of East Coast varieties.  She continued to give us a little lesson on what varieties they had.  I was so impressed by this.  We were invited by the bar and actually shown each type, where they were from, and described them.  Very interesting.
She also made us aware of the \"happy hour\" specials.  Enjoyed the conversation with our waitress.  Very cozy.  Didn't rush us. And absolutely loved the dining experience.  
If in the area would definitely go again.  Make sure to try the shrimp prawns!"}
{"text":"Mussels and more mussels in the Green Thai Curry, Cilantro and Coconut Milk.  Delicious, steamed mussels in this light green curry broth.  The restaurant provided a small loaf of bread that you could sop up the delicious broth. I would definitely come back just for the Mussels!!

My friend ordered the Ling Cod burger and a clam chowder as her choice of side.  She liked what she ordered."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the restaurant very much. We had 8 pm reservations and were seated promptly. Our wait staff were attentive and friendly. We started with the wonton wrapped prawns. They were slightly over cooked and could have used more flavors to enhance the flavor. The main course was fish for all, at our table we had the char, the walleye and the scallops. All of these were delicious, fresh and flavorful. After dinner, we shared the new York cheesecake with a sour cherry compote and cappuccino. The portions were generous and the compote delicious. We were enjoying conversation with our guests and were the last to leave the restaurant, but the staff were both patient and generous with their time!"}
{"text":"I wish I could find a good restaurant like this in the States. The food was excellent and I wish I was here a day longer to try more. I will pass a recommendation to my boss who will be here in a few weeks. I was contemplating on reducing a star because the wine pours are small. In fact, the measure them next to a wine glass with water. I'm sure wine is considered an import and the cost is expensive, but at least put it in a carafe so it feels like more. I decided on five stars because the food was out of this world and wine situation is minor, but it stopped me from ordering a second glass."}
{"text":"Great location.  Essentially a seafood roadhouse and bar.

Staff 4
Food 2 to 3

A good afterwork meeting spot."}
