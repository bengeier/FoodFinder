{"text":"I was hopeful for this restaurant because it is close, but I was extremely disappointed at the service. The waitress (who appeared to be an owner) seemed very rude as though she was rushing to get my party of two out of the restaurant. As we were standing up and leaving, she was already clearing our table. Keep in mind the restaurant was very slow and we were one table out of a total of three occupied tables in the restaurant. When I tipped the waitress and thanked her, she just replied \"bye\".  We were only there for less than 30 minutes and business was slow so I didn't understand her curt behavior. 

The sushi itself was unremarkable. The rolls tasted quite dry, which I am not used to."}
{"text":"Very good sushi at a great price.   This place is always quiet and the service is great.  Owned and operated by a husband and wife who care about their customers!   My wife and I have come here for years and they had a baby present waiting for us after the birth of our first child.   Who does that!!!!  

You should definitely come here"}
{"text":"Great service, comfortable, fun place to relax and eat great classic sushi done right! The edemame and miso soup delicious!  Reasonable prices and great Asahi beer on a hot day! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly staff!  Found via Yelp app today and happy I stopped.  Have tried several sushi bars throughout valley and the quality and freshness is at the top.  True gem close to Arrowhead Mall and the stadium.  Welcome to PHOENIX Sushi Yuki!  I will return often!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is an example of trusting Yelp reviews too much.  Recently another Sushi my GF and I enjoy has gone downhill.  As a celebration dinner I wanted to do something nice for my GF so after the gym I wanted to pickup a sushi dinner.  After reading the Yelp reviews I decided to try this place.  I picked up the take out order which was ready for me sitting in a Styrofoam container.   The bill was $64.  Once I get home I see 6 small pieces of sashimi when I say small they looked like half the size of other places.   I had a total of 26 \"small\" California style rolls, all basic and nothing special and 2 seaweed salads.  Somehow what is normally $40 at most places was $60.  The sushi was below average in taste and for the price I was very disappointed.  To sum it up we got below average quality sushi, much smaller in size for top notch pricing.  Not sure what happened as the Yelp reviews seemed good but this was not a good first experience.  We were not happy.  This unfortunately will be our only experience."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Soups were full of flavor. The best miso soup I've ever had anywhere. Staff was attentive and friendly. Bento box was a good amount of food. Sushi was delicious. All around great experience!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great variety and good quality food. Really good service and friendly staff! Christina was so sweet and attentive to our meal! I definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Once again this place never disappoint me. The best Kimchee's ever and the spicy dragon roll was amazing and the spicy ninja avocado was the best."}
{"text":"Love the owners... family owned! Wish they had a patio and it wasn't so dark inside. Great service. Love the sunshine roll!!! Filling rolls with quality fish. Their saki is hot and stronger than some places I go to. Prices are decent too. Okay happy hour. Love that they open at 11!"}
{"text":"I really love this little place. The employees are kind and the food is delicious. The crunch roll is my personal favorite. Whenever I'm craving sushi, this is the first restaurant I think of. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"Yelp did not disappoint! Coming through town, spending memorial weekend on the road from Cali, and was in the mood for sushi. Loved the ambiance, service and food! Tempura  was bomb and my kids enjoyed their bento boxes."}
{"text":"Their rolls were better than most of japanese restaurants in the area.
The fish was very fresh and very tasty. I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves fresh japanese sashimi or sushi. Also, the server was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in the west valley! Anything you order- sushi, noodles, even the edamame is super delicious!"}
{"text":"Best prices with the best service!
This family sushi operation has it figured out.
We tried 5 different rolls and my son had teriyaki kids plate... All were excellent.
Definitely our new sushi spot close to home."}
{"text":"I love this place, I have been coming for years but not since the new ownership! They are super friendly and they explained everything to my husband and I. The Miso soup is awesome with good flavor. We had the opportunity to try a Japanese  Matcha Green Tea and it was delicious. Everything was fresh and my husband was almost brought to tears because of the teriyaki salmon (he lost hope for good seafood in AZ)
The teriyaki salmon was grilled to perfection.
This is an amazing  sushi place that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"The wait staff was wonderful. Prices were reasonable, and the food was awesome. Went with a friend and their family, we all ordered sushi.

Of on the west side, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Fabulous food - great prices and a very fun atmosphere, I highly recommend this for your personal sushi spot that all the locals go to because we know how great it is. If you like to be at the sushi bar, you're in for a treat because the sushi chef really knows how to chat it up and be fun - which is something we have been looking for since my husband moved over from California and i finally feel like we found our own little sushi hang out. I haven't been there yet at happy hour - but from 3-6 they have discount dishes at really great prices and fabulous sake prices as well."}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi, great service, very clean and the staff were very attentive.
Killer shrimp rolls and the spicy crab rolls are amazing"}
{"text":"Nice little, affordable but good sushi spot, staff super friendly. Chicken teriyaki and Las Vegas rolls were good.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Sushi is always fresh. I encourage you to go to a local sushi place and support them. They're family owned. They're great owners and service is amazing. You won't be disappointed going to this place. I've had all their raw fish and it's always fresh and never fishy taste or smell."}
{"text":"I have always loved Sushi Yuki and now I get to love it more! The new ownership is amazing, they have increased the overall experience! The service is friendly and Steve is just one of the nicest people to have helping you. The environment is as welcoming as walking into your friends home for a meal. They are full of smiles!! The sushi is alittle bigger than it was before and it just taste fresh. We got the Hawaiian, hot night and the spicy & spicy which were great but my favorite was the Palm Springs!! If you try anything on their new and improved sushi menu try this it's the BOMB!! Highly recommended!! Overall if you haven't been here it's a must."}
{"text":"GREAT food and service. One of the better discoveries on the west side. Cherry Blossom Roll and Palm Springs Roll A+++
Definitely a new mainstay on our restaurant list. Awesome job Sushi Yuki."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Service was polite, it's family owned and we were treated very nicely. I will definitely go again and again.  It's definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"OMG. Seriously OMG. This place Sushi Yuki in Peoria Arizona is amazing. Super delicious sushi and amazing staff. I am super stuffed."}
{"text":"Was here last night to get some Korean style sushi. Not very many places do this other than Mido sushi in Tempe (you gotta ask them, not in menu). Pretty much it's salmon and tuna sashimi, red bean paste (spicy), garlic and jalapeños and baby lettuce wraps. 

This place is like a whole in the wall joint. Not your typical Japanese feel, they play that bomb country music, which takes away from the ambience. The environment is pretty boring. I'm not sure but I think staring at the walls got my heart racing....that type of environment. 

The food came and yeah..... I wasn't really impressed at all. The sushi didn't seem that fresh. The cuts were pretty small in my opinion and for sushi a small combination it took a while for the food to come. They might be a little bit short on staff or its family owned. Idk but wasn't feeling it. 


\"Bish don't kill my vibe\" -Compton's best"}
{"text":"To start, I have been an avid fan of Sushi Yuki for the last 4-5 years. I am from San Diego originally and have had some pretty good sushi in the past. 

I quickly learned what is great at this place and what to pass up. I can tell you that they do have an all you can eat for just $24.95, though it's a limited menu, but enough that you don't feel shorted.

So, here are my 3 all time picks.
1. Albacore Nigiri. 
On one of my visits I decided to rank the rolls and and nigiri by a 5 star system. This order flew off the charts!!! OMGoodness! generous portion of Albacore, with a delicious vinaigrette made with minced garlic shallots and vinegar and sugar (I think). of the five star system, I ranked it 10 stars!!! I am serious.

2. Spicy scallop hand roll.  
this delicious hand roll was so fresh and had the perfect amount of spice and extremely fresh scallops.

3. Salmon Nigiri.
Biggest pieces of salmon, plus so buttery and tasty, um, um, um!

Now to the service, it is so, so here. Sometimes they're your best friend and sometimes...?

Yesterday afternoon, May 24th, 2012 I took my nephew who is from out of town and his toddler (2yrs) to eat sushi here. I wanted to go for the ayce sushi for $24.95.
 We sat down at one of the tables and asked for ayce menus. The wife of the chef  said please sit at the sushi bar. I said can we please sit here since we have the toddler and it's easier for us. She came back and asked again and my nephew repeated the same thing at which point she gestured to me to go by myself and eat at the bar while they sat at the table! :) I know you're thinking I'm making this up, but it's true! lol. I told her you, \"You want us to eat separately?\" Then I think she caught herself and smiled and walked away. 

I think she was worried we were going to share food for the ayce with the baby or something.

So, in the end, while the food was decent, we were left feeling stressed most of the lunch because I could tell they were upset with us, which doesn't make sense when we were only one of a few customers in the whole place and were dropping $65 bucks for two people.

I really like the food and the prices, but I guess my pride is getting in the way and now I feel like I don't want to go back, which really stinks for me and them."}
{"text":"Great place. Went for lunch today and had the lunch special for $8.95, it was spicy chicken bulgogi bento box. Came with miso soup, salad, gyoza, california roll and rice.

The iced green tea was really good also. The miso soup was the best we've had. Beware that the spicy is REALLY spicy and you need to be able to handle that.

We'll definitely be back to this gem."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

Very delicious sushi. Had the crunch roll, crab Nigiri, tuna Nigiri and a Texas Roll.  The Texas roll was very different. Had spicy mayo inside with the crab mix (California roll on the inside?)  It was good and I'm still trying to take it in. Don't get me wrong.. we ate it all lol.. it was enjoyed by my husband and I  

The crunch roll was delicious as well. So much flavor. 

The Nigiri was super fresh and delicious.  Husband even had a 2nd order of each after the meal was thought to be over. Haha

Highly recommend this place. New ownership took over and super super friendly. Great service.  Drinks were refilled quickly :)

Try this place! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Check out AmberL's review from 5/2/11, My actual date of visit too. 

I have been here once before, it was in Feb 2011, and we got some really good sushi (not happy hour) for the price.  Stunning presentation. 

Planned to go back last night for happy hour but read AmberL's review and thought... what the heck. 

Went in, the place was empty.  

The lady came over to us with menus and had to ask for happy hour menus she brought us everything but those. 

Asked the lady a question about a soft shell crab roll i had had previously and she said \"YOU GOT PICTURES\" and walked away!

Kind of odd.. to be honest it did get a little better.  She brought drinks and refills, she asked how if everything was ok, she refilled the soy sauce and she saw i was nearly out of ginger and brought me a huge amount. 

Ordered 5 rolls 2 of them were... \"ify\" i had not had yellow fin before...was it supposed to smell like that? and taste very very salty?

The rest were good. but by far she/someone was having a very bad day and i wont be back, looks and sounds like this little gem is on its way down? maybe this was a one off bad day for them."}
{"text":"Very very good! Palm spring roll was out of this world. Restaurant was calm and organized and service was on point!! Definitely will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been to very few sushi places in the valley, and most of them have been the strip-mall variety, but I always keep coming back to Sushi Yuki. It is quaint, friendly and, in my limited sushi opinion, they have pretty good sushi. 

I usually get the combination rolls dinner -- California rolls, cucumber rolls and tuna rolls. I know -- not really sushi, but it is as close to sushi as I'm going to get, and it is yummy. So there. 

Anyway, it's fairly small and not super busy, but probably a place for a lot of repeat customers like myself. Check it out if you are ever on the west side."}
{"text":"This is a small gem! Sushi  is fresh & delicious! They have a happy hour menu that starts at 3pm! Their miso soup is very good & their bento specials are awesome!"}
{"text":"Saw the happy hour menu on here showing it is everyday, came on a Saturday and was told it's only during the week. Should have read the other review to warn us"}
{"text":"I took my 3 kids here today for lunch and we could not of had a better time. Our waitress was super friendly. The kids had bento boxes and I had a couple rolls. 2 kids had the spicy chicken(mild) and the other had bulgogi beef. The bento boxes come with so much food. I was eating some of their food while sharing the rolls. Everyone enjoyed everything. The kids want to go back and I would be happy to take them."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! My wife and I moved here from Seattle a little over a year ago and have tried at least 10 places all over the valley, nothing comparing to the quality of teriyaki in the NW. We found Sushi Yuki about 3 months ago and cannot stop returning here. Every time we come, we try a new roll or dish and they always exceed our expectations!"}
{"text":"Not bad but unfortunately nothing to write home about. I always order a Las Vegas roll to check the locations taste and culinary genius and this one was pretty normal. 

I also ordered a spicy salmon handroll and some salmon sashimi which were both the best things I ate here. 

The salmon was fresh and it was a lot of sashimi for the price of $8.95 which was great. I would come back for the sashimi at that price. 

Decor was nice altho there was conflicting noise from the music playing and the sports on the tv, but I was at the bar so I was right next to the tv. 

Service was great."}
{"text":"Ordered to go food, nastiest sushi and teriyaki ever to take home. Chicken undercooked and sushi just not done right. Never eating here again!"}
{"text":"I like their happy hour specials.  They're a small family-owned spot in a strip mall which is kind of refreshing in a world of Kabuki, Ra and Stingrays.

I really liked their fish to rice ratio, freshness of the fish, sashimi and sushi offerings, and even some of their more creative offerings weren't bad (I'm just not a huge fan of crazy sushis).  Don't get the teriyaki chicken, its not very good and NOT grilled.

I thought their prices were reasonable and they seem very clean.  They're a bit slow, but they do everything themselves (mom and pop that is) so that's a little expected..  Just relax and enjoy the quiet change.  :)"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times since the reopening. 

I'll be back 300 more. 

New menus, fresh feel. Sushi is killer, udon is on point. And Steven is exactly the person you want running the front of house. He's attentive, but not clingy like wet hands and saran wrap (or an ex-girlfriend). 

The guy remembers us when we go in, our likes and dislikes, and is always accommodating and ready with suggestions discovering new flavors and food,-- even down to the Sake ( free tip: go with the Double Distilled Sake, it's only $12 ) 

Go in, order up. And enjoy."}
{"text":"Stopped here as it is across from where our truck tires are being inspected and aligned.  Our first time eating here.  Good food.  Husband tried the tuna sushi and enjoyed it.  Six pieces to the order.  

We plan to return in the future."}
{"text":"Big Huge slices of fish, my biggest ever experienced in Arizona.  I could not believe it, the chef just smiled. He knew i was happy before I even put it in my mouth.  the rice was fresh, partly because we went for lunch.  
I started off with some warm sake, and miso soup, a must when you sit at any sushi bar.  miso was good, and then after my dad and I handed our order the chef put some nice fresh wasabi, you can tell when it's fresh because of the potent smell and gooey like texture.  accompanied by a very pink ginger, it was very yummy and would hold me off till the sushi arrived.  First up was the Maguro (tuna) it was alright; big slices but not very fresh or flavorful, the Hamachi (yellowtail) was different, same big slice but fresh bold flavor absolutely delicious.  then the Sake (salmon) which was good, not as good as the hamachi.  And finally to finish off our nigiri sushi the albacore, oh my gosh, beautiful presentation with finely sliced scallions on top.  This was the winner of both my Dad and I.  It was sooo soo soo good.  Then the rolls came out, a baked scallop roll which is a califronia roll with massago and scallop on top.  and also a dragon roll which was Unagi (freshwater eel) inside with spicy tuna and avocado on the outside.  

My Dad and I weren't impressed very much by the rolls(sort of sloppy in preparation and not very appetizing) but the Nigiri, well, it captured our hearts.  we will be sure to come back and order some different rolls next time, I give the chef some credit, maybe he didn't have his groove on yet because it was early in the day haha, but either way, he made loyal customers out of us.
Also the atmosphere here is very quaint, family style operation run by wife and husband is what it seemed like.  Very nice friendly people.  great service and they gave us some complimentary watermelon slices before we left, gotta love that.  Parking is great, location, well, right next to Sprouts and it's sort of a hole in the wall.  but nice size once you open the door.

Sushi rolls were 10 each, and the sushi was 4.25 each, warm sake was 3.99 and I also ordered a cold one, which was 8.99.  Good prices, better than Kabuki across the street and cheaper sushi price than Tokyo Lobby but the fish wasn't as good as Tokyo Lobby."}
{"text":"Everything was great,  service is good. Price is decent. I will come back sometime soon. There are many great places this is better than average."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to come here and try out the sushi since we live a mile away. Typically little \"hole in the wall\" restaurants are hit or miss. The sushi wasn't that fresh (had a fishy smell and a lingering fishy taste) we went for happy hour and they charged us regular price. The lady had broken English so we didn't bother to tell her. We won't be coming back anyways due to the fact we'd rather drive an extra 8 miles to our favorite sushi bar. I feel bad giving less than three stars since it wasn't terrible, just not something I'll be craving to go back too."}
{"text":"Have you ever had Sushi so good, you felt like a flying fish as you soared away from the sushi bar? 

This is a real mom n' pop place, the exterior very plain and basic... but when you walk in it has about 20 tables and a sushi bar to seat 10.   The ambiance in is very calming and the whole place has a relaxing with a warm orangeish hue. 

Mom, is the waitress and Pop is the sushi master.  There is a definite language barrier, but when they don't understand you they smile and nod.  Once they understand they are happy to provide oblige ones request. 

Now, the best part (besides the happy hour prices) the sushi. 
Nigiri sushi... I tried the salmon and the tuna, both were very fresh and didn't smell like fish... they smelt like the ocean. The salmon was soooo perfect.  It melted like butter, amazing, really amazing.  I feel like writing a poem about this place. 

Other items we ordered were: 
Futo Maki - a veggie roll... this was good, and generous with the seaweed. 

Alaska Roll - warm and delicious for those prefer some baked salmon rolls.
 
Negihama - Yellowtail and scallion roll... the scallions were strong, the fish was very fresh. 

Tuna Roll - delicious. 

*************

Will I be back?   Oh yes!! Yes, yes, yes,  I hope they can be consistent. 
Until they can prove consistency, I am afraid I can only give then 4 stars. 
That is the only reason they did not get five. 

Sushi Yuki \"you-key\" not \"yucky\"."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We have lived here for 5 years and this has been the only teriyaki/ sushi spot that is delish!! Customer service is amazing! Love their sense of humor! Portions are perfect!"}
{"text":"Dropped by because i was hankering sushi and was getting hangry [hungry + angry]. This place did not disappoint, service was fast and friendly. Sushi was fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious sushi! The place doesn't look too inviting but don't judge a book by its cover - this place is that hidden gem you've been looking for. Definitely recommend! We take all our friends here for a nice dinner out any day."}
{"text":"Currently here. The service is terrible. Only two other families in the place... Both have already been served... Why am I waiting 10 minutes for a waitress to take my TOGO order? 
And to top it off, they didn't have something I chose off of the menu and she was just like \"we don't have that\" and put my paper that I checked the boxes off on, back on my table in front of me. Walked away!! And brought me back my receipt for my soup only. Didn't ask if I wanted anything else or anything. Just walked away. Never going back. This food better be good."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our sushi here. We came here because there was a picture of a happy hour menu on yelp so we thought they had happy hour, but the waiter said they do not have that anymore. So if you're looking for a place with happy hour, don't go here! The sushi was very fresh and flavorful. We ordered the Las Vegas roll, the spicy tuna, and a tootsie roll. The Las Vegas roll is always my favorite but the other two were great also. It was not cheap by any means. We probably won't come back here just because we can go other places for happy hour sushi, but it was really yummy!"}
{"text":"After trying many Sushi restaurants in the greater Phoenix area, my wife and I keep coming back!

The Miso soup is great!
Fish is fresh!
Staff is friendly!
And pricing is normal!

Would recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I recommend Sushi Yuki to anyone who believes that good sushi can not be found in a land-locked state. Also for anyone whose a little shy about ordering sushi for the first time. The menu has very concise descriptions of all the sushi, and the tables even have diagrams with pictures on them (granted, they're promotional material from one of the beer vendors they carry, but still). 

Personally I recommend the boat. It's filling, it has a lovely layout, and  you can pretend you're a sea serpent or something. 

If you hear the waitress laughing it's because you're eating the garnish. Take it out of your mouth and put it away."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since the previous owners had it.  It's always great food and service.  The sushi is excellently prepared and presented.  The staff is happy to provide suggestions and explanations. Prices are reasonable. One of my all time favorite sushi spots."}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look like much.

Service was friendly, and very attentive (only one other group of diners were present). Everything was reasonably priced.

The octopus salad was full of flavor; nicely seasoned, and very tender. My tootsie and tempura shrimp roll did not disappoint, either.  I also tried my dining companion's salmon skin roll. Not really a fan, but surprisingly this version didn't taste as fishy as I thought it would be. I actually liked it.

I'd definitely come back here again. What a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi place around the West Valley and this is now my favorite spot. They have excellent customer service and reasonable pricing.Im very big on the quality of fish and their fish is very fresh.FYI Happy hour is 3-6pm ..."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi, BAD. We were in the neighborhood, heading home after doing some shopping. I whipped out my phone and searched sushi places on google maps. I found the typical places like Kabuki, but I wasn't feeling that. I wanted to try some place new! Sushi Yuki had great reviews so I figured, why not?! The sushi here was FANTASTIC, TO DIE FOR. I ordered a couple rolls (california and spicy tuna) and sashimi (red snapper and tuna). The fish was fresh with lots of flavor. I was still hungry so I ordered an order of the salmon sashimi which our waitress recommended (she was fantastic, too!) she said the salmon was best to eat with the radish and fresh lemon squeezed on top. Let me just say, I WILL NEVER EAT SALMON ANY OTHER WAY EVER AGAIN. The radish gave a good crunch that was fresh followed by the tang and tartness of the lemon. The salmon was like butter in your mouth. I almost asked for another order of it even though I was already bursting at the seams because I was so full. This restaurant is family owned and everyone was extremely friendly. We will most definitely be going back! The waitress was friendly and provided fast service. She gave multiple recommendations of the sushi they have and how to eat it (hence eating the salmon with radish and lemon). She really knew the menu and what combinations of flavors went well together. My mouth is watering writing this review - I can hardly wait to go back and get more!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Yuki several times and have NEVER been disappointed. I have a weakness for the Vegas Roll. They are an awesome little mom and pop joint, but their sushi is just awesome..."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely obsessed with this place. Incredible food, friendly staff and very clean. I haven't tried an item on their menu I wasn't in love with."}
{"text":"I loved coming here until my last visit. Being questioned about whether I could eat sushi while pregnant really got old the 3rd visit. Mind you they were months apart. It ruined my visit each time. I go to enjoy a nice dinner or lunch with my husband and the entire time non stop questions and comments about whether it is safe or not. You would have thought I was in there asking for a crack pipe by the way I was drilled. It's a shame because I do love the food."}
{"text":"Try the Palm Springs roll! This place will easily become one of my favorites & the service was very friendly"}
{"text":"Great cuts of sushi and goes down like butter. The staff is very friendly. I will be back"}
{"text":"This food is terrible. I  ordered the bulgoki
Lunch combo $8. It lacked flavor and seemed a little undercooked. As soon as I ordered I heard a microwave turn on ( just Sayin). 

They are overpriced for flavorless food."}
{"text":"Went there once and the fish was old and felt rubbery with a room temperature feel. Maybe I went on a bad day but it was enough to ruin it for me"}
{"text":"This is my preceptor's favorite place in the area so we came here for lunch today. He was going on about the bento boxes here so I already had in mind what I wanted. He ordered a spicy tuna hand roll to start and insisted that I got one too, so I ordered one as well. I also ordered the spicy pork bulgogi bento box. As soon as the hand rolls were ready, instead of placing them up to be taken out by the server, the sushi chef brought it out to our table. I thought that was a nice touch. They were very nicely presented on the plate. I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture of them first. There was a good amount of tuna in the hand rolls and they were good. The tuna and cucumber were fresh, and the tuna spiciness was mild for me but detectable. 

The bento box comes with miso soup, a small side salad, 2 pieces of goyza, 4 pieces of California roll, rice, and the spicy pork bulgogi. It was a good amount of food for the price. The miso soup was kinda whatever for me. The side salad had what tasted like maybe a ponzu sauce? on it. I liked the sauce way better than the usual mayonnaise based salad dressing most places have on their salads that I will not eat. The goyza were cooked very well. They were very golden brown and crispy on the outside. The inside was pork and cabbage and had a nice savory flavor. The California rolls were the usual rolls, but they were rolled tight and were very fresh. I appreciate any restaurant that treats their Cali rolls like they treat their specialty rolls. The spicy pork bulgogi was DELICIOUS. It was actually decently spicier than I thought it would be, which I loved! The meat was tender and came on top of a little pile of shredded cabbage. 

On top of having really good food, service was really fast so we were able to quickly get in and out. I don't know where we will be going tomorrow, but I would love to come back here."}
{"text":"Having just moved here from California we were a bit wary of getting good sushi grade fish. We were pleasantly surprise! The hamachi was tasty as well as the salmon and unagi. Nice menu selection of rolls as well. Great service to boot and we are super happy!"}
{"text":"Great little  place, I walked  in because  I  saw the lunch  special  posted  on the window. $8.99 for a combo plate, pretty  good  serving size; spicy  chicken  and  rice, 4 cali roll,  2 dumplings, miso soup and salad. The food was delicious !!!... they run the lunch special  til 3:00pm, , then happy  hour  sushi  from 3:pm-6:pm. The place was clean, the people  working  there were friendly  and attentive. Will go back again  soon."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite sushi places. Have been coming here for 6 years and have never had any issues with service or the fish. Getting the fish can take awhile but we pass the time playing with our daughter and drinking bombers."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this Korean restaurant! Great food, great service...that says it all!"}
{"text":"Went around 5pm and sadly there was no happy hour after 5 for a mom and pop shop like this. I highly recommend extending the time slot. Food was ok, it took awhile for the food to come out when it was just our table to be served and we didn't order anything complicated. We did request fresh wasabi and was given a very small portion but charged up the alley for the amount given. Service is everything when it comes to a restaurant and the lady didn't seem that friendly. I would only go back if they had better happy hour time slot and food selection on that menu."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. The spicy tuna was perfect!"}
{"text":"This is our family sushi place. We're very particular about food and service, both of which Sushi Yuki provides.
My sister asks to come here just about every time we go out. Good location, polite service, and great ambiance. 
Was a little worried when the ownership changed hands, but Steven is great.Thanks to the whole crew for always making my family feel welcome and feeding us so well."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. Best sushi spot I've been to in years. The fish was extremely fresh and masterfully cut, the service and people were wonderful. The sushi chef was extremely friendly and quietly smiled to himself as he prepared the fish. Always great to see someone who sincerely enjoys their craft. Long story short; Wonderfully decorated place with a welcoming staff and more than perfect food. I will most definitely be coming back and if you haven't been there yet you're missing out!"}
{"text":"i actually enjoy going back to sushi yuki, not only because it was really close from i used to live but the sushi i must say, wasnt bad! 
The owners are always very attentive and very friendly. it is rarely busy, so i never had to wait to long for my food. the sushi selection is a bit small but it is pretty basic. i usually get the spicy tuna and i try something new everytime. i will always go back to sushi yuki whenever i'm in peoria."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, after you go in, you know you're in for a treat. I've been coming here for about 2 years and I always love the customer service as much as I love their food. Their rolls are always fresh and they have more than just sushi for those in your party who want something else. All is delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone wanting good quality sushi in the area!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places. I stopped in and got the salmon teriyaki. The portion was very generous and came with a california roll. The roll was super fresh and the rice was not all stuck together like you get at some places. It's a casual sit down place where they will come take your order at the table. Folks were very friendly and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sushi Yuki for years now and stopped by tonight not knowing they were under new management. The experience was excellent and the sushi quality has increased! The service was incredible. Steve was so attentive and kind that it made date night that much better. I cannot wait to continue coming back."}
{"text":"Solid sushi under new ownership. Like a lot of places like this, Yuki is Korean owned and operated, and they have some excellent Korean options like pork bulgogi. Thought the spicy tuna and spicy salmon were good and the Texas Roll was fun -- a roll with steak on top that was cooked lightly with a torch."}
{"text":"I really like this spot the employees were very friendly and personable but most importantly the food was fresh. My favorite was the California roll and spicy crab roll. The miso soup is complimentary! I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi!! Great Service!! 

When my friends and I are going to Sushi, there's no need to discuss where, we know where to meet!"}
{"text":"Sushi Yuki.. Sounds like cartoon character's name.. So i gave it a try..
well.. it didn't meet my expectation.. i ordered my usual sushi.. salmon.. also known as sake..  it had lemon on top.. i asked the server why there is a slice of  lemon .. and server said.. \"that's how our customer like it\"..  it was clear to me that their fish was not fresh enough to be served without the lemon..

I still gave a shot.. took one bite.. and \"check please\"..  
maybe i am spoiled with quality sushi from other places.. or maybe i am picky??  nah.. 

sorry i had to give low rating!! maybe next time they can serve without the lemon and rotate their fish more often!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Best sushi in the valley. One of the owners and server Christina is great always smiling and extremely helpful. Customer service is amazing and the food is sooooo good. You have to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and ordered the chicken yakisoba and a an order of sushi. The food was incredible and the fish was super fresh. My partner ordered two rolls and when they came to the table we were so impressed with size. He was very impressed with the flavor. Overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I eat here at least two times a week and never get tired of it.  Spicy chicken bento box lunch special, spicy edamame, dragon rolls and catepillar rolls are my favorite.  All are amazing and ive never had anything i did t like.  Some of the best sushi ive ever had and ive had a lot.  Servers are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Imagine if you had a spot where you could come in anytime and get the family experience. I usually try to come to Yuki once every two weeks with the squad, but if I could I would eat there everyday solo. The prices are fantastic, their kimchi is on point, and is a good pair for just about anything. They got all points covered if you want sushi, udon, the delicious miso. Ahhh man I could keep this going but I guess I'll stop. TLDR This spot is delicious give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great Family owned lil restaurant with very good service. Been going here for 10 years!!! They always remember us!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, and $5 saki bombers after 8pm."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Try the kim chee fried rice, Ninja jalapeño, spicy edamame. Amazing family operated, local spot. Can't beat it"}
{"text":"Very good food. Very friendly staff. We will be coming back for sure. We weren't sure how it was going to be under new owners but it was just as good if not better. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh sashimi. Tuna like butta. The Albacore roll and spicy lobster rolls on the happy hour menu were really good. This tiny, casual spot next to Sprouts is definitely a hidden jem. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about Sushi Yuki and wanted to try it out. Came with a friend and ordered the Tootsie Roll, Arizona Roll (eel with crab and cucumber), Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna Roll. Everything was pretty good. My rice kept falling apart, but supposedly that's a good thing. The shrimp tempura had cream cheese in it, which isn't typical, but still good. A bit pricey, but they have happy hour from 8pm to close. I'll have to come during happy hour next time.  The restaurant wasn't very busy, despite a great location (next to Sprouts). Waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"As an experienced sushi eater that has done numerous reviews please understand this is an alright spot. I dont have anything particularly bad to say but nothing really sensational either. 

Good: Fresh fish (which is the most important thing really), very nice decor
Bad: Small portions, poor service

Meh. I've experienced better is as good as it can be said. Tastes great though."}
{"text":"This is a cute little mom and pop place.  I w
asn't impressed and it isn't anything I would try again.  Thank God For the Hot sauce.  Even then it still wasn't good.  The fish did not taste fresh, and I've never had tuna that tasted fishy.  
I think reviews are very important, & I definitely do not like to leave any type of a bad review for a company especially when it is a mom and pop shop. Two stars is pushing it on this one."}
{"text":"Went there last week. We read the menu and saw the Bul Go Gi was only $7.95 each.  The waiter was polite and the food came within 15 minutes, but immediately, my wife saw that it was not marinated correctly like other Asian restaurants.  It was a rough day for us, so when we left we didn't realize that we were charged $11.95 each for Bul Go Gi.  Although the Bul Go Gi came with plenty of rice, miso soup, and 4 California rolls, there were no side dishes like the other places. We should've gone somewhere else... Or checked ahead of time."}
{"text":"Great little find. Run by friendly mom and pop. Have sushi bar if you want to watch and eat. Friend took me there for lunch; he had sushi and the teriyaki chicken; I had the tempura U-don that came with california roll. Every thing was really good. They had a lot of lunch special that come with sushi. I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome people. The happy hour prices were great for the wallet. Ant the food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Love this cute little spot. I jog over here sometimes and have a little bite and usually by the time I'm involved my daughter drives over and joins me. Just a great mom and pop type place. Family owned. It's the real deal though. Awesome."}
{"text":"Small little family run place with great food and great service.They always remember us."}
{"text":"I love any restaurant that has high quality, fresh food at a reasonable price and owners that really appreciate your business.  Sushi Yuki does all of the above and then some.  

It is a small family run place and I find it comforting to walk in and be greeted by the same smiling faces every time I go.  I never have to wonder, the food and service are always great."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend after a spring training game and tried a few rolls. I have to say, the place was close to empty, there was one table being used when my friend and i walked in plus employees, i figure that since it is located in a strip mall, maybe it does not get a lot of foot traffic, or people in the area were just to busy at that time to be there. I would not know, i do not live in the area let alone the state.

So we ordered the following:

Super Philly Roll (it came with salmon,never had it that way)
Spicy Crap Roll
Crunchy Roll
Spicy Tuna Roll

I was going to try the sushi, but opted not too, not because of the place, i was just to full with the rolls, and i know me, if i start with one dish, i will not stop, and my friend is not into sushi, she digs rolls, but not just sushi.

Not sure if i will every be back to that particular spot, but if you are in the area, give it a shot, not too bad.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Sushi was good and fresh. Didn't taste to fishy place was clean. My only complaint is the rolls could have been bigger."}
{"text":"Food is incredible, service is above and beyond, owners aim to please. New favorite! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is mine & my family's favorite sushi establishment! It's owned and run by the sweetest family! The sushi is always fresh and delicious. I recommend the ice green tea, it's great! The sunshine roll and sashimi are the standouts here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area and stopped in for late lunch with my wife and 20 month old. It was an off time to be eating and our child was more fussy than normal. She drew all over the menu with the marker provided to write the order. 2 minutes later, the waiter brought out his niece's coloring book and crayons. Incredible example of caring for the customer. Food was great, but we will be back because of the customer service!"}
{"text":"Best sushi on this side of the valley. Awesome staff that took really good care of me and my wife. We had the spicy garlic edamame also the ninja avocado I highly recommend this.

I also ordered one of the combination plates my wife got the yuki roll. So good, family owned and they know what they are doing.

This place is so good and the service is incredible I guarantee we will need to make reservations days in advance just to get a seat."}
{"text":"Theyre under new management from the previous owners. Still family owned though. There is a significant change in fish suppliers and an increase in the quality of the food however there is room for more improvement. 

One piece less sashimi sushi than the previous owners BUT the pieces are larger. The chicken teriyaki is much better. Their oven baking technique leaves the chicken more tender with a slight burnt crisp (which i like). They should include the salad in a bowl though because the ginger dressing mixes with the teriyaki sauce diluting the flavor. Definitely should use that as a scale of quality for people new and familiar with the previous owners."}
{"text":"First I like Sushi. I eat sushi every couple of months or so. I know nothing about how it is supposed to be prepared and presented. What I am trying to say is I am no expert on the subject. I just know what tastes good to me. 
I was by myself and wanted sushi. My daughter was free and we met at Sushi Yuki on Thunderbird. We were early for the dinner crowd so we had the place much to ourselves. We ordered. I, really not knowing exactly what I was ordering except it sounded good. We had a cucumber salad, Spider roll, cucumber roll, California roll, scallop hand roll. Way more that anyone should eat. Everything was very good. I enjoyed the meal and the company of my daughter. 
Our waitress was very attentive making sure our glasses were full and everything was to our liking. I will definitely go back. The plus is they are only 2 miles from where I live."}
{"text":"Cute mom and pop place. Sushi is decent stuff but make sure you aren't in a hurry since it seems like the owner may be the only sushi chef."}
