{"text":"Great place for Brunch!  Friendly staff.  Try the California Benedict you will Love it!"}
{"text":"Hello yelp fans, long time listener, 1st time caller!
What was not to like about this place. We came in a little late, kitchen food was perfect. 
Had shrimp app., bruschetta app, and chicken strips with mac & cheese.
Shrimp, awesome, took some home. Bruschetta fantastic sauce & presentation.  The chicken tenders white breast meat lightly breaded, I got the sauce and blue cheese on the side. A very generous portion, the Mac & cheese was not as cheesy (soupy) as I like, but loved the jalape√±o peppers in it.
The beer was good & cold both drafts and bottles. I would love to see them get a larger selection of craft beers on tap, but that's just me! 
Our sever Lauren, very sweet, polite, friendly, and kept the beer flowing, even though she was the only one behind the bar for all of the restaurant.
Great Job Lauren!
Just traveling through by myself, everyone made me feel as if a regular, nice hometown bar atmosphere! Plenty of TVs for any sporting event! 
Next time through; \" I'll be back!\"."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Felt rushed. Gave us a check before we finished eating and before asking if we wanted anything."}
{"text":"Service and food has gone down hill.  Friends and I have met here once or twice a month over the last five years. Patio and bar service has gotten progressively worse. We've waited 5-10 minutes for anyone to attend our table and/or booth if in bar.  Note this:  during happy hour, appetizers are smaller in size. Some dinners are smaller now as well.  Also a draft pint might be $3.50 but a larger size is $8.00 (servers don't tell you, you'd get more to order two pints, than the larger).  Food is served without plates, napkins, utensils.  Third time for disappointment; we'll go elsewhere now."}
{"text":"Recently relocated to Scottsdale for work, and coming from the South, I have been in search for good food, good company, and access to SEC sports!

I found it all here- all of the bar food basics, elevated, and some other dishes that may surprise you!!

Nice, covered, dog friendly patio with numerous tvs- the bonus? Your server will bring a speaker box to the table so you can actually HEAR the game that you are focusing on!

This will definitely be a go to sports bar and grill for me!"}
{"text":"Always great service. Good food. Love the free shuttle service home.
Can't say enough good things about Ko's."}
{"text":"I work near KO's and it's lunchtime favorite. This place is a hidden gem. It features a huge and social bar along with a large room of booths/tables. The food is top notch and their menu is enormous. I haven't tried everything but they haven't missed yet. Their burgers are really, really good and cooked to perfection. The salads are huge and very tasty. I love that you can have your protein made \"cajun\" and added to any salad. I had some potato skins the other day that were fantastic. I didn't know going in but they are on the happy hour menu and only cost me $4.44! Good beer selection that seems to change often as well."}
{"text":"First time here..... Won't be our last! Food was awesome and definitely scratch made. Southwest melt was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Jessica is awesome I love her! Great cold beer and a good way to spend any night of the week!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great customer service every time,  really good menu with tons of options. Tater tots! Good local beers on tap and they always have drink specials. Fun place to watch any sports and bet on a few ponies!"}
{"text":"The fries were overdone, i.e. cracker-like, and the pulled pork sliders were too dry for my taste. The grilled chicken was decent and the bloody Mary average. Otherwise, the service and atmosphere were ok."}
{"text":"Good food, bar food, brunch o Sat, and Sun, lots of TV screens. Individual speakers. Ask waiter. Free ride home. IF too much to drink. Lots of beer choices. Poker on sat, always something going on."}
{"text":"ATTENTION ALL PIZZA LOVERS-  not you fake pizza lovers who think real pizza is pizza hut or papa johns -  this place has outstanding pizza. i'm originally from the northeast and i can't stand fake or fast food pizza. i've been on a mission for 25 years to find the best pizza in arizona. this place is in my top 2 of all pizzas  i've had in 30 years here. it's a cool place with lots plasmas around the restaurant and bar. the restaurant and bar are separated so you can go here for drinks with friends and be stupid or sit with your family and have a great dining experience in the restaurant.  it's sports orientated. the pizza is large and just all around back east. really authentic flavor.  the ribs are really good. they have a full menu of italian, ribs, chicken, burgers, appetizers, etc... . during happy hour, which is 7 days a week, you can get half off appetizers whether you are sitting in the bar or restaurant. good, fun, quality place. great food all the way around. great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"I'll make my first review a positive one.  KO's is my families' go to restaurant.   The servers and managers are always polite and friendly.  It's a nice mix between bar and restaurant atmosphere, so my kids love it.  There are time when you wonder if your server is ever coming back, especially when they are busy, but overall, the good food, service, atmosphere and price make this a solid pick."}
{"text":"I love this place!   It's close to my office so I probably frequent it once a week for lunch.    They have a varied menu so there are plenty of options for all palates.    While a burger is usually my staple here, I was feeling froggy today and decided to change it up.   I ordered the grilled chicken wings and they were delicious.    Plus, I love the fact that the owner walks around ensuring his customers are happy.  Haven't done a happy hour here yet but it's on the list..."}
{"text":"Monday night.  Best pizza special in town. Half off all medium and large  pizza. 

We ordered a sausage and mushroom. Well done. Excellent pizza.  

Great TV
Lots of room to watch the game 

Best thing about KO'S is the high level of service.  Be a regular. Have fun. You will become like family and you will always be welcome"}
{"text":"K O'Donnell's is my opinion the best sports bar and grill in North Scottsdale. I am not in the restaurant/bar business, but I go out enough to know that it is very hard for an establishment of this type to \"get it right\".

I am sure that there is much more to it, but it would seem like the major elements to success would be a good location, facility, product offering, people, and probably most important, good ownership. This place seems to have all of that. Conveniently located, a comfortable bar and restaurant with booths, a large covered patio, a great menu with quality food, countless TVs for sports, and a very friendly and attentive staff. Hard to find a place where you are comfortable watching football, having a business lunch, hosting an event, smoking a cigar or even bringing kids for dinner.

If you have not been to KO's, it's well worth a try!"}
{"text":"My office is right down the street from here and it is definitely in my list of go to's for the nearby lunch circuit. 

The atmosphere is nice... Definitely a sports bar but I like how the dining area is separated from the bar. Both the bar area and restaurant feed out to the large patio which has mist system for summer and a nice fireplace for the cooler temps. I'm not sure if they use that though cause I've only been there for lunch. 

The service is friendly and usually you can get sat and eat pretty fast. Everything I've had on the menu has been pretty good and the people that I've been here with have said the same. They have some specialty items along with the usual sandwiches, burgers, pizza, etc. 

I would recommend this place to people looking for a nice sit down lunch spot. I don't know that I would to go hang out to watch a game because I've never been there other than lunch and don't know what the crowd is like or if they are busy. 

I know they have some special events also. I think the owner is a pro poker player so they have poker nights and other events that look to be pretty fun time."}
{"text":"KO's is by far our most favorite spot to go for dinner. No matter what you get the food is fantastic - overall very consistent quality. A must have is the fried cheesecake! 
The staff is always outgoing and super friendly.  Overall just a great atmosphere with incredible people and delicious food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal bar! Xcllent bartender \"Taylor\" had drinks and pizza ALL GREAT! HAPPY HOUR PRICES - OH YES!"}
{"text":"When my friend and I walked in we were greeted by a pleasant young woman who took us to the nearest table to be seated, I requested a booth since most restaurant chairs bother my back, I want to be comfortable while I dine.
The manager came out to take our drink order, and walked away, however returned before she was out of sight to take our appetizer order. 
When the mozzarella sticks came they appeared to be half cooked at best, the manager took them back to the kitchen and appeared a reasonable amount of time later with freshly made mozzarella sticks that were quite good, although I was less than impressed with the marinara dipping sauce which was a dull cloudy light red color.  
I ordered the steak fajitas, while my friend ordered the blackened cajun chicken alfredo.
The food came out in a timely manner, however the meats on both plates were bland, overcooked and dry.  The fajitas came with plenty of topping options, and are a good size, however lacked seasoning and having been overcooked were dry and tough. 
The alfredo was bland even after salting the food, there was no flavor to be found. The lumpy bland alfredo, with the overcooked dry tough chicken as a whole was just not good. It tasted like something I would microwave out of the frozen food section.
The server, or manager did not check with either my friend or I with the quality of the entrees, and I had to repeatedly ask a server, or hostess to get my server or the manager.  
When the server asked if we wanted boxes for the largely untouched plates, I replied it would be up to my friend as I had no interest in the food there, nor would I want to take it home.  
The manager returned, and asked what I needed, I asked her to take the food back to the cook and let him taste the bland pasta, lumpy alfredo, the overcooked chicken and steak.  She did at that point agree that the alfredo was a little on the bland side, and took the dishes to the kitchen.
Ten to fifteen minutes later, with no response from the manager, my friend and I walked to the hostess station, and I asked if the manager would be returning to follow up with our table.  I'm thinking we should be given the check, some sort of something so that we no longer had to sit at this table.  The manager replied quite snootily that since the mozzarella sticks had come out uncooked the first time, they took that off our bill, and she had told the cook about the concerns I had with my food, so there was no bill.
I really would have valued attentive service, instead of having to chase around a snotty manager, and above all- I would have appreciated food with flavor.
I will not be back to this establishment, not just for the problems with the food, but also the attitude of the manager in particular."}
{"text":"A very good variety of food on their menu, great place to watch sports with all of the TV's and very happy with the service and staff. 
I have been here a few times and each time I'm very happy with the food and service. It's a great place in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Seeing as know the owners my review might be just a litle biased, and at the same time I see how hard they work to provide excellent food, drink, customer service and continuously improve their operation.  Awesome food, free poker three nights a week (with a chance to win a seat to the World Series of Poker) , countless TV's and a high energy, friendly staff are just a few reasons to visit KO's."}
{"text":"K O'Donnell's has become one of my local favorite hangouts. The food is good the service has been great. Your entire staff is awesome however Jessica one of your bartenders has became my favorite."}
{"text":"You must ask Stephanie behind the bar for the most amazing wing conbo    It's off the menu so ask for Honey Hot mixed with barbecue!! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Good atmosphere.  Our server was very good and enthusiastic.
Expected more diverse items on menu."}
{"text":"Paige was great and very attentive.  My wife and I have been going to KOs for wings for the last 8 years. The rest of the menu is great too. Give them a shot. You will have a good time."}
{"text":"My family is in Phoenix for the weekend and came to K'Os due to really good reviews on various sites. I am unsure how this place has received much positive at all. In all honesty, we didn't find much good. The chicken tenders were extremely
boring and underwhelming, barbecue chicken pizza on the dull side, decent tater tots but nothing special.
Music was mostly out of date but there were a few good songs played. Tv situation is already not great and far away for most people, as well as having weird channels like QVC. For people living in the area, might not be horrible to go once in a long while, but visitors to Arizona, I don't recommend wasting a meal here."}
{"text":"Love the food, atmosphere and local people hanging out.  But most of all, my wife and I always look foe Candyce.  She is the best server.  Remembers us every time, remembers what we drink and eat.  Really cool and makes us feel welcome."}
{"text":"After recently moving, I have been to this restaurant twice. I went once for a business lunch, which was surprisingly pleasant. The service during the morning shift was \"ok\" but nothing special. The food tasted great and came out beautifully. However, when we  returned for dinner one night, it was a completely different experience. The food was still good, but the service in the bar area was slow and lacked customer service. When the manager brought out our food, the body oder from him was horrific!! I dreaded every time he walked by our table, or came over to ask how the food was; it was literally nauseating! Then, I guess his shift had ended because he sat at the bar with a group of men who treated the restaurant like a trashy bumbling bar. I suppose it was my own fault for assuming that professionalism would continue on the dining-bar area. Whether or not the \"manager\" is off his shift, I shouldn't have to watch him get highly intoxicated and inappropriate just because his shift has ended... Very disappointed in the owners for allowing this to take place."}
{"text":"Solid sports bar. Everyone in the group enjoyed their meal. Service was good and friendly.  Would definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here quite often recently. This is by far one of the best bars I've been to. Service is beyond nice and accommodating; food is great quality and delicious; and the drink selection and serving is always just right. 

The best sports bar in Arizona beyond doubt, and one of the best bars overall in town. 

Keep in mind.. Don makes Ghandi look like a worthless son of a bitch. You'll never meet anyone better. One could only wish Don was their father, mother, lover, etc. He knows music from the 70s but looks like he grew up in the 80s! Claims to play golf but only has one hole-in-one... 

I've had nothing but the best service and coldest beers at K O's, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"They have a shuttle bus 6-2 a.m.!!!  Woohoo, can't beat that! 

Happy hour til 7!!  Woohoo, can't beat that!

Poker tues/thurs!!  Woohoo, can't be that!

A+ Brushetta!! Woohoo, can't beat that!

Service not to shabby!! Woohoo, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Veggie Burger Was Delicious 
Service was great - Thank you to our server Rachel"}
{"text":"No other place in north Scottsdale to watch football or sports. Food is extraordinarily delicious and service is amazing. You never want for food or drink when Laura is working. She makes sure you have all you need for a great night. I feel like family here. Did I mention the food is amazing? Drink specials every day and brunch that is the best breakfast in the valley on saturdays and sundays. Get to KOs you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great food and prompt service!  For a sports bar the food rivals very good restaurants and sometimes come here just for the food!  Will be back many times!  Prime rib anything is excellent!"}
{"text":"The Cheers of Scottsdale, where everybody knows your name. Great food, try the weekend brunch menu."}
{"text":"We got to Kos all the time. The food is always amazing and the staff is always friendly. We love having Kaitlyn take care of us on the patio. If your looking for a fun sports bar with a great patio come here. Ask for Kaitlyn she will make your experience great!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! Our server Lauren was amazing. She was attentive and cheerfully talked us through the menu, as this was our first time here. She made our day a little bit brighter and we will definitely be coming back and asking for her to be our server. We ordered a delicious pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries are to die for and we had her box up an extra order of them for us to take home!"}
{"text":"best bartenders in any sports bar love the food and atmosphere so entertaining always happy to sit down at the bar and enjoy"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's close to home and we go there often. they are very accommodating and the drinks are reasonable and the food is very good. It was great to find a good sports bar here in Scottsdale.  

The pizza is fantastic if you haven't tried it before. 
The Prime Rib Wrap is great.
Burgers (including the turkey burger) are awesome
The grilled wings are awesome as well. 

Also, they have a good brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"Came here as our last stop before heading to the airport splitting after a great family weekend celebrating moms 50! We enjoyed a great time watching the 49er and many other games play this day! 

We started with the loaded nachos (minus any meat) and potatoe skins minus the bacon. Both were delicious, nachos were full and you can actually taste the beans which is rare! We loved both these dishes!

For lunch, table ordered the: Cajun pasta(no meat) grilled cheese, vegetarian sandwich, enchilada sandwich with black bean party, chicken pesto and the quesadilla (added spinach instead of the cheese). The food was really great for almost all members! It was hot, spicy, and tasty! The Cajun pasta was not very spicy and therefore the older sis was unhappy and the vege sandwich was very dry. Buttttt everything else was like amazing! We all wish there was a place like this in sacramento/california! 

One very important factor in enjoying the game, food and the experience was our waitress! She was super prompt, made all our substitutions perfect(which is hard!) and was super easy going and happy! I really really am sad to head to the airport after such a great meal! I highly recommend this place for any football fans and anyone in desire for a great American meal! Very healthy options too and kid friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with a friend.  Friendly wait staff, good food, decent prices, and close to the Scottsdale Gun Club where my friend and I like to go shooting.

They seated us quickly at a nice table and our waitress was there quickly to ask about drinks and appetizer.  The appetizer did come out wrong as we made a special request for it, but they quickly took it back and brought us out another one the way we ordered it.  

The meals we ordered were very good and I intend to go back.  I especially enjoyed my fish taco's as it is hard to find a place that makes good ones.

I will definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"Went in last night with a group of 25, the food was great, service was great, and our server Taylor was amazing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken salad is the best in the valley . Lots of fresh ingredients great balance of flavors unbreaded chicken tenders. Every time I come in here the food has been outstanding.  A lot of the items on the menu are cooked from scratch."}
{"text":"I first stopped at this place for a quick bite to eat right after happy hour began.  It was pretty a random choice, since I was in the area, and simply wanted something quick and easy before I headed to Golfsmith.  Since it wasn't busy, I wandered around, and was pleasantly surprised by the place.  The staff was friendly, the patio was nice, and all tables and seats had good views of the TVs.  The menu was extensive, and you could find almost anything you had a taste for.

I had the chicken fingers appetizer with the blackened cajun spice, and they did a first rate job with the seasoning.  Although some places tone down their seasoning, the spice mixture was just right. Although it might be spicy for some tastes, it was just like I cook at home - and very rarely found in a restaurant.  They also had a nice selection of draft beer.

I have since been back several time, and have tried both their pizza and pulled pork.  Both were very well prepared, especially for bar food.  The place was very busy the last two times I was there, but it was very well staffed, and plenty of servers to handle the volume of people. 

As has been noted by others, they also have a shuttle bus, which is a definite plus. It will pick you up and take you home.   I have never used it, but I have talked with others that have, and they all love it.  It is great that the restaurant has that option available."}
{"text":"Really cool place to just eat and watch the game.  Service and food have always been good.  Wish they would open one on the West side of town."}
{"text":"FOOTBALL FANS BEWARE - You can arrive as early as you would like to this bar and even if there is not be a soul in the place, good luck finding a seat or table in the bar as they let people reserve ALL of the bar stools and high tops.  I will admit the food here is pretty good but what a joke, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The chicken pesto sandwich is AMAZING. The service was fantastic especially the hostess Kellie who was very helpful. I will defined be back soon."}
{"text":"If you want a sit-down restaurant for a quick lunch, this is a good place to head. They have some nice (and different) sandwich and salad options including a turkey and brie sandwich and a \"biltmore\" salad with blue cheese, corn, and baked chicken. 

My biggest gripe is that they keep changing suppliers for their food! My husband and I tend to head here before the movies maybe about once a month. They seem to really have the food down...and then they change it up (have seen this on everything from fries to tortilla chips.) 

Also, if you are looking for a quiet lunch, don't go during a sports game! This place gets pretty noisy with the 20+ TVs going and the fans cheering."}
{"text":"Nice place - drank at the bar and the bartenders were super cool - I'll go again."}
{"text":"Great time at K O'Donnell's with the team. Food was excellent and service was fast - Chris was the best!"}
{"text":"I met up with a great friend from High School, Jay Lessard, for the first time tonight. I have to say that the food was amazing and the service was equally as good. I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot with great food and a huge dog friendly patio! The wings, bruschetta and pretzel bites are all great appetizers to start with. The deluxe mac & cheese is my favorite for dinner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, had the fish & chips, good service, fish a little overcooked but tasty"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Sports Bar! TV's everywhere, cold beer, awesome food and excellent service. The staff at KO's is extremely friendly and they always make you feel welcome. Try the cheeseburger sliders. They're off the hook!!! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome, food was awesome. We came in to watch the baseball game and they have a ton of TVs and the MLB package. The wings were the best I've had and the fish tacos were on point."}
{"text":"Great dining experience tonight. Great food and awesome service!  The staff is amazing and love the patio."}
{"text":"I have to say.....  DONT EAT HERE!
the service was ok the food was ok. 
 I brought my son with me for a lunch meeting and thought the place would have been a great place to meet. About halfway through our lunch I begin to have a stomach ache. When finished with my meal I couldn't get to the restroom fast enough!!! I race to the restroom to find no lock on the bathroom stall door! It's gutted out and has obviously been this way for a while due to the dirt and old paint all messed up inside. How much is a lock or little slide lock.??? Then as I blow this throne up someone walked in so you have to cough so they don't open the door and see you blowing it up! I look around and the restroom is filthy! No paper towels! The maintenance on this place is none! I think what does the kitchen look like? Are they just cheap and don't fix or clean anything? 
 Maybe the food just didn't agree with me? I get out to the truck and my son 17 says dad I really need to use the bathroom, my stomach really hurts! Then I'm just really disappointed. Screw this place! Let's go find a place where you can at least lock the stall door! I will never return here for sure!  I wish them the best but please put some money into the he little stuff! 
Thanks rant over!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar and grill. We called ahead for seating for 20 after a ballgame. The service was quick and friendly. The food was good. The nachos are huge! The Irish Stew is comfort food! The outside patio had our group set up in two big tables. It was a nice place to celebrate our winning game and enjoy fellowship with the team."}
{"text":"My husband and I, and our two children, love K O'Donnell's Bar and Grill.  Even though \"bar\" is part of the name, K O'Donnell's is great for families.  If you enjoy sports, this is the place to be... HD TV's everywhere, including in the dining area, but the volume is not overly loud.  The food is wonderful... you can't find a better burger in town for $8.50 (comes with a side, such as salad, fries, or onion rings - which are made perfectly and are delicious).  Our son always orders a slice of pepperoni pizza... it's huge... and only $2.  I've had the Teriyaki Chicken sandwich, which is also a great choice... tender chicken breast marinated in a tangy teriyaki sauce, a thick slice of grilled fresh pineapple, served on a toasted roll... with a side, for $8.50.  The service is awesome; soft drinks are refilled without asking.   The owner has personally greeted us at our table on multiple visits.  The servers pay special attention to kids.   When my son won a Little League championship game last year, and we stopped at K O'Donnell's to celebrate, the staff brought out a complimentary \"make-your-own\" ice cream sundae, with several small dishes of toppings such as M&M's, sprinkles, chocolate syrup, etc.   My son was thrilled and, needless to say, we keep coming back, knowing that the staff will take care of us.  They just expanded an inviting outdoor patio and we hear that they host live entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights.   I can't say enough about this place... come check it out for yourself, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. We were visiting from out of town and were watching the NCAA basketball tournament. Multiple tv's to watch different games at once. The food was fresh, tasteful, and very good."}
{"text":"Found this place from using Yelp.  Fun place and great burgers.  Sat in bar, staff very friendly. Wish it had been a bit warmer as they have a great patio with a fireplace. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Happened upon KOs after visiting the Scottsdale Gun Club.  Was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and quality of food.  My brother and I sat at the bar and though they were pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon our bartender was on top of it.  The burger was obviously fresh and not frozen, the pizza had good flavor and a ton of toppings.  The place is not going to blow you away with design or atmosphere, but for a neighborhood sports bar the food is much better than Zipps or Goldies.  Our excitement for the day was your typical 30 year old self entitled Scottsdale male make scene about being charged for the extra tortillas he wanted for his leftovers to go.  Both the bartender and manager handled his temper tantrum well and receive high marks for their patience and professionalism.  Next time we decide to go shooting, we'll be stopping into KOs again!"}
{"text":"Best place in the world! Great food and servers! Best University of Arizona game watch bar ever!"}
{"text":"Food here is amazing, great atmosphere, and awesome staff. i love sitting on the patio. Either of the two Kaitlyns are my favorite. They always know how to make you have a good time and make you want to come back. they always have a smile on their face and can make you laugh. i love Kos and both the owners are amazing! Such an awesome family owned place."}
{"text":"As a senior citizen, a group of friends and I were treated very disrespectfully and rudely in a recent visit to this establishment. The atmosphere here dictates that if you are not part of the clientele who regularly frequent this overrated \"sports bar\" you are pretty much relegated to second class status in terms of courtesy and service. It is very \"cliquish\" and the food is mediocre at best. We paid our bill and left with a vow never to return. Don't waste your time going to this place. There are just too many other dining/entertainment choices in the Scottsdale area that know how to treat their more mature guests with a lot more dignity, respect and better quality food selections."}
{"text":"A real good menu with plenty to choose from. The wings are quite good and the steak was done just rite. Service was five stars. Always a fun, comfortable atmosphere. A great place to stop for some dinner after work, with or without the kids."}
{"text":"A little too loud for me on the weekends. I do love what they call their grownup grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Well, the food was good, for those of us who were able to get any.

Went with a large group for a friend's birthday, so of course we expected it might take a little longer than normal for everybody to get food and drinks.  No problem, right?  The first bunch of about 6 people that arrived before us got drinks and ordered, cool.  Server (Rory) comes back for the next round, I tell him two of the four of us at the table are with the 3 sitting at the other table, and we order ours.  This is after about 30 minutes, which is what I expected.  Dude never takes their order or even offers them drinks.  Two more parties arrive and he looks right at the still-ignored members and walks past them, serving the other two sets of people.

At the one and a half hour mark, everyone was done eating and they still hadn't even been greeted.  Maybe the philosophy is that if you ignore people with kids long enough, they will leave.  My wife was part of the ignored set, and we had to share entrees with the three of them so that they could eat something...and she was paying, so we had to get the check that he gave to our 6 year old son at another table and give it to her.  When they had brought out the food, they asked her if it was hers and she told the food runners she was still waiting to order.  I guess they didn't give a damn either.

The rest of the group was rather unimpressed as some of them didn't receive additional drinks or refills, and of course they caught that about a quarter of the people with them didn't even get a drink order taken over an hour and a half.  We planned to stay longer and spend 2-3 times as much money (and normally tip 20-25%) but as it was we had to pay our tab so that we could go somewhere else so that we could actually get some food.

Unless you have at least 2 hours to wait just to get greeted if they feel like waiting until the rest of the people with you are done eating, it's not worth showing up to guess whether or not you'll be served.  Screw this place.  Maybe if they do carry out orders it would be worth calling in to get something but there's no way I'm wasting my time showing up to eat or drink there again; I know plenty of other places that will be happy to take my money."}
{"text":"Great Grub, Great Drinks, Great Service!!! Enough said :o)

No wait, I'll say more :o)

This place has customer service nailed across the board!!! My buddies and I felt like King's!!! Hell, some of us even felt like Queens!!!

Any game we wanted, Dasha had us covered! Fire ambiance while we smoked our cigars, CHECK!!! Late night pizza, CHECK!!! Dasha obviously has a degree in customer service and she makes sure her staff operates just as she does. 

And let me tell you about the bar service. Caitlin has you covered from top to bottom! Her prompt and attentive service is a thing of beauty. I know people that would pay hundreds of dollars for that kind of service. 

We look forward to our next visit!!! Keep up the great work ladies. And THANKS again."}
{"text":"I eat here almost once a week. They have great pizza and wings! They delivered the wrong pizza one time but quickly corrected error and were very easy to work with. Great staff!"}
{"text":"I have been here a lot as I lived almost walking distance of it for years.  

Unfortunately I haven't been back since they added some new beers, I've heard they now have an IPA which is great to hear.  KO's is a true family owned bar and restaurant which is now run by his daughter.  This is something that I value personally because in Scottsdale everything is corporate.  KO himself is a great guy, and as I result I like spending my money there.  They have poker nights which are always fun along with trivia night which is surprisingly fun.

In terms of food, this is one of those places that has a rather large menu.  Normally I would criticize this but in KO's case I love it.  Often times my girl and I can't figure out what we want for dinner and in those cases heading to KO's is the best option.  You can get Mexican, American, Italian, or whatever you want from the menu.  I've never had a bad meal here and I've ordered just about everything off the menu at this point.  The honey hot wings are my favorite of any wings I've had in the valley and surprisingly the pizza here is very good too.  The sandwiches are great, my girl's go to menu item is the Turkey Bacon Swiss (TBS) which I would recommend myself.  The sweet potato frys here are probably the best I've had in the valley, it one of the few places that actually get them crispy.

The patio is great here, KO allows and sells cigars which I like.  It almost like hanging out in someones backyard but you have all the food and beer at your fingertips."}
{"text":"Once again another exemplary meal.  The service is unsurpassed and the food is consistently excellent.  This is our go-to place"}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  This place feels like a TGI Fridays. Okay, maybe the food is a little better, but it just feels tired and outdated to me.  I've heard the breakfasts are good and I've never tried them, but I've just never been impressed."}
{"text":"Food is very bland and the staff seems to be too busy to pay much attention to you. Drinks are also too expensive and mediocre at best. Very dumpy establishment."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is the wait staff. They make the place and it's a good thing because the food seems to be deteriorating with every visit. It is close to home, so I am hoping that they improve the food."}
{"text":"Update:

11/2016

So I've been here twice since my last review (once I sat in the bar area and once in the dining area). The last time I ate here with my coworkers was great. The food was amazing, the nachos were some of the best. The waitress was attentive and the owner (I believe) even came out to say hello and check on my friend/co-worker. I will stand behind my review of the bad service we received at the bar that first night but I believe that one person is not a reflection of this restaurant/bar and the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"Please tell Candace not to give customers their check prior to asking for it. Thanks for cutting my night short."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and we had great service both times. Once during the day, order pork sliders and they were sooooo good. They also had Stoli on special for $4. =) The other time we were there was in the evening, it was chili and we were outside but they had a great fire place that kept our area really cozy. We split the pork chop dinner and it was great too. You have to try the creamed corn! (I try not to eat french fries but they are beyond awesome too LOL)"}
{"text":"KO's is a north Scottsdale staple at this point. Its located in the same lot as the Scottsdale Gun Club tucked away on Northsight just north of Raintree. There aren't a lot of options for sports bars in that neck of the woods and I'm happy to report that their food is better than average. I'm a huge fan of their chicken pesto sandwich. French fries, onion rings and chicken tenders are always fried to perfection and served with cold ranch dressing. The atmosphere is pretty casual but still maintains some class with its somewhat eclectic industrial decor. 

Overall, Its a pretty good place to grab lunch and a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"We were looking for a different place to try one night when a craving for burgers struck us.  I referred to my trusty Yelp! app and found this place which is about a mile from where I live.  Walked inside to a very cozy atmosphere.  TV's everywhere for the sports lovers.  They have pretty typical bar food, but they manage to turn it up a notch to gourmet status.  We had the wings which were perfectly spicy, the enchilada burger, and I had the rancher burger.  These burgers were just awesome.  Came with tasty fries and I was a happy girl.  The bartender definitely knew how to pour a healthy drink also!  Will gladly come back here next time I am in the mood for a burger.  The price range is about $10-25/person, depending on how much food you order."}
{"text":"I had never been at K Odonnell's despite seeing 20% off coupons in The Clipper Magazine and driving past it on my way to Sam's.  Went there Saturday night.  They had their misters on for the patio but since the patio allows smoking I didn't want to take a chance that a smoker would sit next to us and puff in my face.  So inside we went.  Within seconds of getting the menu we were asked if you were ready.  I then volunteered that we had never been here before and as a result did not know the menu AND that we needed more time.  I wanted the Pork Green Chle Soup, but was disappointed that they were out of it.  Out of it??? at 7PM on a Saturday night?  Come on now!!!  I then ordered a cup of the Guinness stew and after one tablespoon I knew that this was not for me.  When something needs that much salt and pepper AND tabasco, it's time for a change.  And isn't soup supposed to be hot??  I then got the Chicken Tortilla soup which was really delicious.  My hubby decided he would drink his appetizer.  He ordered a special they had of a bloody mary made with Absolute Peppery Vodka.  I didn't know that type of vodka existed.  The drink was really good!   You didn't think I was just going to have the soup without slurping some of that delicious bloody mary, did you????  The fish and chips I ordered was plentiful.  3 nice pieces of cod made with beer batter and really crispy french fries just like I ordered them.  It came with a delicious, fresh, non-mayonaisy cole slaw.  Nice.  Hubby ordered a medium rare hamburger that came perfectly cooked and which he claimed was delicious (although I wouldn't know if you know what I mean! )  Some people don't share.  I digress.  He also ordered sweet potato fries which he said were delicious (although I wouldn't know if you know what I mean! )  Get my drift?  All in all we had a very nice tasting dinners and the pricing was just right.  We think we definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Meat lovers pizza is amazing!!! Bartenders are awesome...especially Laura!!! A place where everyone knows your name!!!"}
{"text":"Came for St Patrick's day, making our way down to south Scottsdale. They had a rockin live band out in the patio and lots of seating, even a little standing room in case there are no open tables. It's definitely an older crowd and more laid back, I'd say averaging 50's. Didn't try the food but grabbed some drinks at the bar and service was pretty quick! Lots of TVs outside to watch sports games."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our friend Jay Lessard, who is a regular, and it did not disappoint! Great atmosphere, tasty food, good pricing. Visit, you will not be disappointed! Try the prime rib wrap!"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC in town on Vacation checked this place out... Because of yelp reviews and was not disappointed great food and great service. A+++"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and one of my favorite spots for food and beverage!  Staff is attentive and friendly!  Bar staff  always adds to the experience.  The southwest chicken salad and the pizza...any pizza are two favorites!  Wait...the potato soup and the pork green chili are also to die for!  My daughter begs for the half baked cookie served hot w/ ice cream on top!"}
{"text":"This is the best sports bar ever! So many tvs and the best food. I love the grinder sandwich. Dasha is the best manager, so nice and always willing to change a TV! I love to bring my dog and hang out on the patio.  Definitely try this spot you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their Rancher burger is one of the best I've had! Great food and awesome service! Chris was great!"}
{"text":"Love KO's!  Fun, friendly sevice, everything I've had there is good.  Try the southwest salad.

Also really good chicken wings.

Only holdout on the menu, italian sausage sandwich, the sausage was more english than italian... i.e. really no flavor.

Aside form that, burgers have been great, appetizers, jummy, and for those days when I'm really wanting comfort food, fried Walleye!!!"}
{"text":"$12 Bottomless Mimosas!  Really, do I need to say more?
OK, I will

Service started slow, but slowly became amazing.  Is it a coincidence that I was more impressed with the service after each mimosa?  Maybe.

The brunch food was good, and the patio is nice with TVs everywhere.
I wish there was better sound on the TVs, and I also wish they didn't allow smoking on the patio.  

Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Always a comfortable place to eat, watch games and play Trivia on Wed.. Our server tonight was Dillon, he was one of the hardest workers I have seen in Years~ Always had a smile on his face, bussed tables, was attentive and is the BEST~
Thank you~!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Its sad to say this but when you are going there to watch a football game and you cant even get a refill on your drink because your waitress has gone and disappeared and doesnt return to check on you. I waited and hour for me to get a drink. I waited 45 minutes just to get the check. She aslo said that when she came back with the check she would give us raffle tickets to put in....Never came back with those tickets. I think this girl should be fired i was upset to the point were i got up and walked out. She didnt deserve a tip but i gave her one. Her name is Angela. I was there on the night of the super bowl game. I will be back to that restaurant no doubt but I cant believe that someone would hire someone like that. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for happy hour, though the happy hour menu is limited. I ordered the pretzel bites with cheese. The cheese was a weird brown-orange color but kind of spicy. It was good. I also ordered the hummus platter, which comes with regular hummus as well as red pepper hummus. The regular hummus was on the dry side and kind of bland. The pita bread was dry too."}
{"text":"There is nothing really stand out about this place.  The service is crap, the food is overpriced and underflavored and its expensive for bar food.  

I believe this place is frequented as it has prime real estate right on Northsight and you can see it from the road.  Aside from that there is nothing.  Go to one of the neighboring establishments and you will fair better."}
{"text":"Paige was a great service technician of culinary extravaganza delight.. She adhered to our beckon' call."}
{"text":"Omg!  The King's Cakes are nothing short of amazing.  Pancakes with peanut butter, chocolate and bananas.  It makes a pancake neutral person find love!  Yummy.  Omelette was good too.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"AWESOME bar! The food is not great with the exception of the pizza slices served late night (for a buck!!!), but the drinks are good and they usually have great specials. The best part is the bus that will take you home for free if you live within a few miles and can not drive yourself. The bus makes this bar top notch in my eyes!"}
{"text":"Fun night, great food- my new go to place for Football season and any other time!  The hostesses were very friendly our server was so attentive  and friendly. I had the pulled pork sliders and my friend had the grilled cheese..... so delish. The coleslaw that came with my sliders was awesome. Lots of tv's so you can watch multiple games. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Upscale bar food, TVs everywhere you look, perfectly poured cocktails, ice cold draft and bottled beers, smiling faces, friendly staff, exceptional service!!!... What more could you ask for in a sports bar. 

It's a great place to meet for happy hour or hang out late night. Meet your friends or make some new ones. KO's is always filled with great people. 


There are nightly food and drink specials, happy hour M-F from 3-7 and every night from 9-close, Thursday ladies night, Wednesday team trivia, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday free poker, and it's the absolute BEST place to cheer on your favorite football team. Let's go BRONCOS!! Meet me at KO's. 

Make sure and ask for Jane at the bar for a friendly smile!!!! She loves meeting new people!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place. If you looking to catch a game the have what seemed a TV for everyone. Nice large bar for hanging or they do have a restaurant area. The outdoor patio is the place to be. Very well done and even a fireplace to keep you warm on a chilly Arizona evening. Drinks were good and I needed some chow. I had the Rancher , loaded with cheddar, bbq sauce, crispy onion strings and bacon. This was a good burger, the side of slaw was very good also. Service was good at the bar on the patio it slipped a bit but overall good time was had."}
{"text":"I have been going to K O'donnell's for a couple year now and absolutely love it! The staff has always been super friendly and inviting along with some amazing food. My all time favorite are the wings, which are SO GOOD. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim about a year ago and we keep coming back! I know it may look like just a sports bar, and it is, but the food is actually so good and the servers are genuinely nice, kind people. We took my in laws there tonight and they both really loved it, and one of them is really picky... so I'm just saying. 
..Mother-in-Law approved. Ha!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings and a very helpful Bartender (Christy?).  However, found the atmosphere on a recent Sunday evening to be lacking.  I'm 57 and I was easily the youngest person in the bar. Although in fairness a Sunday evening snapshot may not be a reasonable sampling.

If you're in North Scottsdale and want a good to great SportsBar experience I'd try All-American in MarketStreet or Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers in Grayhawk."}
{"text":"Very good service, food was pretty good, liked the atmosphere as well. Doesn't stand out that much, as far as being exceptional food or anything unique or different, hence the 3 star rating. Would go back again... in a year."}
{"text":"KOs has always been a favorite of mine. Surprise to me found out they deliver! Just ordered dinner to be delivered and was just as satisfied with the food as I am when we go in after shooting at SGC! 

Their deliver time exceeded my expectations, I am used to waiting at least an hour to an hour and a half for deliver and they only took about 45 minutes! I was very satisfied with not just the quality and attention to detail taken by the hostess over the phone when she took my order but also the quality of the food was the same quality I have come to love and expect at the restaurant. 

We had the Rancher Burger and a side of potato skins. Both were absolutely delicious and nice and hot!

Thank you KOs!"}
{"text":"THIS is the sports bar you've been waiting for. It has TVs as far as the eye can see, and Off Track Betting to go with it. I visited here for lunch, initially chosen because they allow dogs in their outdoor patio area. The patio was cool even in the middle of the day thanks to the mister-fans. I had the triple decker turkey club. It was good, not great, but definitely what I was in the mood for. I really like that they offer an endless amount of sports on all their televisions and I can imagine that this is the place to catch EVERY NFL game on Sundays. 

PS: They have an ATM type machine to place your bets on horse races. You win some, you lose some. It's all in a day's work."}
{"text":"This is a great place to catch a quick lunch or dinner.  Nice atmosphere. Had the Black and Blue Hamburger on a brioche bun, w/grilled onions, it was delicious. Good size burger and could barely finish it.  

Here's the great part, if you're a member of the Scottsdale Gun Club they give you 10% off your bill. What a nice surprise. Lots of beers to choose from and cocktails that rock at happy hour.  

They serve other dishes besides hamburgers, like chicken pesto sandwiches. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Was looking for another bar, but ended up here again. They have $3 Shock Tops on Thursday nights, which is a good thing and all the TV''s were on live sports, except the giant screen was on golf for some reason. I got food to go and it actually turned out good that bartender screwed up my order. Wanted Rueben with Turkey instead of Corned Beef because I figured they just use sliced corned beef that is usually chewy. This wasn't the case at all as the CB was shaved and crumbly, exactly the way it should be and it was another really good sandwich on marble rye. Lots of bikers outside though, never a good thing."}
{"text":"Laura was fantastic. I liked the way she greeted regulars and newbies alike. Very comfortable bar setting, superb service.  Pizza was super quick at the bar, if it represents the food you are good to go."}
{"text":"This place was a surprise gem!  Was out running errands in the neighborhood and my husband and I decided to stop in for lunch.  We were there right at 11 so we got to watch as the place quickly filled up with the lunch crowd.  Great beer selection, diverse food menu, and I absolutely loved my chicken burger.  Husband loved his burger too and we both stuffed ourselves!  If I didn't live on the other end of town I'd definitely come back!  Casual sports bar/restaurant atmosphere, very clean and with quick, friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"Always good. I get The Rancher. The sweet potato fries are awesome! Chris was a great server too ;)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their buffalo grilled wings and buffalo chicken strips.  The only other thing I've had was the pizza and it was, eh, okay.

They do have a great happy hour, if you like margaritas.  

Service is good."}
{"text":"The Rueben sandwich which I had today was pretty bad.  The meat was salty, chewy and not layered on the bread.  The bread was fresh, but the meat wasn't good deli meat at all.  A neighboring table decided not to order it when they saw the sorry little sandwich.  The onion strings were good.  The TV's are nice, but they allow cigar smoking on the patio and that was truly obnoxious on this beautiful fall day."}
{"text":"Went here last night with coworkers.  Great happy hour prices.  Nice atmosphere.  Definitely a chill casual sports bar feel. Just got bar food but it was good.  Looking forward to going back for poker or trivia."}
{"text":"Great bar.. amazing pizza.. great wings.. lots of TVs friendly servers who pay attention to you! Did I mention AMAZING PIZZA? Reasonable drink prices as well. Every time we come here I have a great experience."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here with my grandparents. I would give 5 stars for our server personally, he was amazing, totally played along with my grandfather's sarcasm, and was quick with refills etc (if you go in, he is the tallest one, today he was repping an AZ Cardinals shirt). I had the French Dip, so did my grandma, and my gramps had fish & chips. 

Now for the cons, first off the hostess could care less about seating us, it seemed like it would absolutely kill her to smile, when she wasn't smacking the waiters with menus and calling them \"whores\" loud enough that my 80 year old grandparents could hear (they are super old fashioned, I kept praying they wouldn't hear her). Then there was the random server who very awkwardly came to our table, interrupted our lunch to let me know that \"I looked SO familiar, he must know me etc\" and went on and on, in essence hitting on me in front of my grandparents. so awkward. Thankfully, our waiter came over a few times and jokingly tried to let him know it was time to go, but the guy didn't get the hint. That waiter continued to stare and make me uncomfortable until we walked out the door after lunch. Also, my gramps mentioned that the fish and chips were more bread than fish, though they had great taste.

OVERALL, we had a good lunch with our server, who deserves kudos for being so on the ball and taking great care of us, but the cons have kind of creeped me out."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place by accident.  My phone was being repaired at the Sprint store and I had to kill a couple hours.  I'm on holidays and didn't want to drive around, so I stopped into the bar for a couple beers.

I did not eat.   The server was very friendly and efficient.  She chatted when I made conversation.  

I really can't give a full review since I didn't eat, but I did enjoy the bar and the patio was beautiful!

They also have a shuttle service if you drink too much and need a rid home."}
{"text":"Staff is fantastic, food is great. The best place to watch a game and drink great beers with very good food."}
{"text":"Awesome sports bar with a giant and eclectic menu. The service is always friendly and fast. The staff knows tons of customers by name. Great pizza, fried ravioli, wings, amazing salads, pretzels, burgers (try the enchilada burger with fried jalape√±os). Tip- if you're a Scottsdale Gun Club member you get 10% off your food!"}
{"text":"KO's is a great place for lunch during the work week! You get to be in a bar in the middle of the day (which is great), the place isn't crowded and service is prompt, and there are a lot of healthy options on the menu. 

All of the salads are great. They are big and they are full of fresh vegetables & good lettuce. I particularly like the southwestern salad and would recommend it to anyone as a satisfying lunch. It's full of cheese and tortillas strips which makes every bite taste yummy without making the salad heavy. I never eat dressing on my salads however the chipotle aioli type dressing that came with the southwestern salad was amazing and worth all the calories.

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is cause there were random chunks of chicken in what was supposed to be a vegetarian salad. Otherwise the service was good and we weren't interrupted unnecessarily, which seems to happen a lot in Arizona when I go to work lunches."}
{"text":"Great service. Salads are fresh and flavorful.  Able to see a TV from anywhere in the restaurant or bar area"}
{"text":"Usually I enjoy Ko's but the service was unusually poor this afternoon. I would stay away from the \"spring salad\" .. not so \"springy\" this time around."}
{"text":"I so wanted to bump them up to 4 stars because my sliders were very tasty, but I just couldn't because of the service. 

The girls on my team at work get together once a month to have lunch together. This month we decided to take advantage of the beautiful weather and have lunch on KO's patio. There would be 6 of us going out to lunch. I didn't know how busy they get during lunch time, so I called the day before our lunch outing to make reservations on the patio. 

We arrived on time and the hostess took us out to our tables. They have a huge covered patio that fits at least 8 tables and only 2 of them were taken at this time and they sit is in the one area that is not covered. Although we wanted to take advantage of the weather we are all in business clothes and didn't want to go back to work sweaty and possibly sunburned since we apparently had not come prepared with sunblock. I ask the hostess to please sit us under the covered patio and she huffed and puffed and said she would have to move tables. Ok, that's fine by me, thanks. 

Finally we got our table. After reviewing the menu for a bit we all order and then we wait. And wait. And wait. The restaurant did not appear to be too busy, maybe 2 more tables were seated outside (not sure about inside) in the 25-30 minutes we waited for sandwiches, sliders, a burger, and a salad. Nothing that should have taken more than 10 minutes (15 max) to make. So unfortunately, half of our lunch hour was spent waiting for our food. Luckily everyone loved their meals. I had the sliders (mixed the different kinds) and they were all great. The bread was soft and all the meats (pulled pork, prime rib, Asian chicken) were moist and flavorful. 

I'll certainly come back here for lunch because it's right across the street from my work and their patio is nice (especially those chairs at the high tops), but they just need to make sure orders don't take as long to come out during the lunch hour as many people only have an hour they can take off. And please always offer people the covered patio first before you try to leave them out in the sun."}
{"text":"Great place. Enjoyed the patio for happy hour followed by dinner. Good food and our server Rachael was great. Very helpful and attentive. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Mentioned to our server, Kristi, that we had never been here before...and she took us on a flavorful adventure that pleasantly surprised us!! Our appetizer was fantastic(wings and pretzels)...and our entrees were even better! I had a burger and my wife had the \"dip\"! Loved the beer selection...and the service was A+!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down best lunch spot in Scottsdale. 
Food is always great, service is always great, and probably the best managerial style of any restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"Very mediocre, very salty, very large portions. Meh."}
{"text":"I dig the super dog friendly patio.
I really like the setup of the patio overall - it's a very comfortable space.
The menu has choices for everyone and portion size is way up there.

The food itself is OK at best - relatively bland, overall. But, it's bar food in N. Scottsdale, so I think that's par for the course. Nothing bad, just a little on the blah side.

The service...well, um. Yeah. The service. I think the only requirement for employment as a server is to be cute. They sure as hell aren't hired for any of the actual skills needed to be a decent server. Reminds me of the staff at Ra Sushi and way too many other places.

That said - it's still worth a visit! Just bring some good people to have great conversations with and the patio will be a lovely and comfy backdrop for that. And if you're patient and, well, patient - you'll even get some good drinks and decent food. Fido will even get a water bowl!"}
{"text":"Does a great job for what it is. The food is decent for a bar, the menu is extensive, and they seem very organized. I've actually been very impressed with the prices. It's very easy to get a bite to eat and drink when you're in a hurry. But there's a lot of reasons to stay. 

About three nights a week they have free Texas hold 'em. If you can get past the fact that it will be very packed you will really enjoy yourself. But be prepared for some good players. And watch out for Myrna. :)

They have a really good chicken strip and fries dish for the poker players that I highly recommend. 
I love the bar area, lots of great beer on tap and friendly bartenders. The servers are always super fast. 
Check it out!"}
{"text":"We live minutes from this place, but have yet to actually eat there. We've tried before - once we went in at 8pm and were told the kitchen was closed. Another time we were told ahead that we can bring our dog to the patio, but then we were told that excluded us from happy hour specials, so we left. Numerous times I have called to place a pick-up order, and nobody ever answered the phone so we ordered from someplace else. Kinda surprised we even bothered again....
Well, third time's a charm right? 
We chose a Monday because of the 50% off pizza special. We decided to dine inside because there was a game I wanted to watch - I saw it was already on several tv's and when were seated the hostess said she would switch our nearest TV to the game for me. She never did. We had to ask twice and it finally got switched, but it already gave that \"too little too late\" feeling to our night.   
Our waitress was much more friendly and attentive, no complaints there. 
The fried raviolis were \"ok\" - seemed like they were frozen. Barely worth the $5 price.
The pizza was one of the worst I've ever had. I guess it was our fault for not sending it back, but we were starving and exhausted after a really long day at work. The pizza crust was undercooked - it was soggy and so soft my fingers could break through it when trying to fold it. 
I asked my wife - do you think all the pizzas are like this? 
If so, I don't think we'd ever go back, even for 50% off. Seems like the pizza got less than 50% TLC from the cook. 
We couldn't finish it, and we took the rest home with the intent of re-baking it on a stone, to see if we can salvage the crust and make it edible. Well the leftovers hardened within hours, it went from soggy cotton-soft undercooked crust to hardened cardboard cracker, like that. I've never really had pizza like that before, outside of a HS cafeteria. I've had frozen grocery store pizza that had a nice crust. 
This was very disappointing. Can't say that we haven't put in the effort to try this local place, and when we finally managed to dine there... we leave with a very \"meh\" experience. 

Seems like a good local bar to watch sports and have drinks, but the dining experience definitely did not leave us wanting more...."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars. We are from Kansas. Newly married and wouldn't accept my husbands paper ID (given in Kansas until you receive your new ID in the mail) so he had his valid back up ID. They denied him and our whole group drinks. Talked to the manager and she stated \"someone in the group was intoxicated and crying so we can't serve anyone\" which is absolutely not true. don't recommend any tourist to this bar for to their inconsiderate service and managers rudeness. Oh and there was a rat who ran across the floor when we walked in. WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"We decided to eat for lunch. I picked the place b/c it said \"breakfast until 2pm\" and I was in the mood for eggs. It was a nice place when we went in. The food was pretty good and decently priced. My husband really liked the chicago deep dish pizza. 

Friendly Staff."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of sports bars since I am a big for of both adult beverages and sporting events. I went here with a group of friends to watch some football and enjoy some food and drinks. We were on the patio, where they had several big screen TVs with the games. The service, drinks and food were all great, but the thing that put this place over the edge was the atmosphere. Everyone there was having a great time and seemed like a genuine sports fan. I wish I lived closer so I could visit this place more often."}
{"text":"After the way the just treated a group because 1 person was unhappy, lets me know I won't be going there. Our daughter and husband live in Phoenix and we frequently visit and host large family parties but we won't go to this place in case we offend some whiny PC loving crybaby."}
{"text":"If you don't like smoke, definitely don't sit at outside bar. They sell cigars so they promote smoking. Sat outside at table with no smoking sign but it didn't matter. Four different people were smoking around me. 2 cigars and 2 cigarettes. When I asked why my table said no smoking they said yes this table but not others because they are 15 feet from door to get outside. Well 4 feet doesn't help. Duh!!! Just glad I wasn't eating like everyone else. Downed drink and got the f@!) outta dodge!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! The southwest salad with Cajun steak is awesome!!! The bruschetta as well!!!! Servers are very nice and food and drink service is quick. Come here often and will always!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to KO's for years and the food is always delicious. I have several favorites but the Southwest salad with Cajun chicken is always my go to when I can't decide. I usually have it as a wrap and add a side of their yummy French fries. You can't go wrong with their burgers, pizza or their wings either. When I have company from out of town we always make KO's one of our stops. Last weekend we sat on their enormous patio, had brunch and mimosas. I highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"it was the first time my family and I had be here. We all enjoyed our food. There was something for everyone. It was nice to be able to go to a sports bar/ restaurant and everybody to enjoy their food.  Without feeling that they had to compromise. My son-in-law enjoyed his sliders and I had a very tasty salad I didn't feel disappointed. Nice evening out."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was delicious and affordable! I loved the mozzarella sticks and chicken wings. The avocado hamburger was very good. It's busy but the waitresses are great."}
{"text":"My friend likes this place but I don't understand why. All of the patrons are older than me. I had two Bloody Mary here. They are decent. I also had a breakfast burrito with chorizo. A sports bar is not where I would think to go for brunch. I just don't think it's really my scene in there. Prefer a younger crowd."}
{"text":"My husband and I are excited to have found \"our bar\" after moving here from Ohio! We are always looking for places where we can bring our two big dogs and enjoy quality food and service. We were able to enjoy the Cubs game on one of the many TVs out on the patio. Our service was quick and the environment is relaxed. The food was really good and I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to eat. I was even more excited to find out that they had trivia on Wednesday nights. We will definitely be back for the food, atmosphere, and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I like K O'Donnell's, it's A-OK.

We have been here a few times, most recently last week. The food is basic sports bar stuff and good. We've enjoyed the Pizza, Burgers, Loaded Nachos, Quesadilla, Fries, Potato skins, Onion rings, et cettera. 

BTW, they have a nice selection of  beers on tap. I particularly like their Pale Ale/IPAs, including Sierra Nevada. The bar area has about seven or eight TVs going.  Just for fun, count the remotes near the cash register.

For some, one of the pluses of coming to KO's is the benefit of their shuttle bus. It's for those who need a ride home, and really don't want to take the chance of having a personal fitting for one of Sheriff Joe's pink jump suits. LOL  Also, be on the lookout for those blue envelopes that come in the mail... they have coupons for KO's inside."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place to eat! One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos \"Lunch With Stew\". My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. mmmmm, mmm. Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour. Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar."}
{"text":"This place is yummy and atmosphere is friendly. Their fries are crunchy on the outside and fluffy baked potato feeling on the inside. Chicken tenders are breast meat and taste fresh. Their fried mozzarella is also great and the sauce for it has a basil taste."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. 
Leslie the \"manager\" should find another career. 
This place dropped the ball on my order hard, leaving us not only hungry, but made  me look really bad with my co workers. 
Do NOT order food from here if it matters."}
{"text":"Good food (especially the pizza & burgers) , servers & Poker on Saturday nights!!! The owner is are gentlemen and a pleasure if you ever get to meet."}
{"text":"There are so many good things about KO's ... I don't know where to start!  First, the food is excellent and reasonably priced.  The service is great, too! When I go in, I feel like the waitresses and bartenders have been my friend for ages.  Robbie is my go-to bartender, and recently was served by a girl Angela who was so great!  A couple reviews down someone talked about getting bad service and I feel like they have no idea what they are talking about.  I've had bad service before, but never EVER at KO's!"}
{"text":"Service was incredible as well as the food everybody was super helpful and nice and the food was spectacular!! Definitely coming back when in town. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time at KO's and tried it based upon a coworkers recommendation. The atmosphere was fun and inviting. Happened to be trivia night. Although we didn't play, we had fun guessing the answers. Our meals were very tasty and our server Chris was great. He made recommendations when asked, Drinks were refilled promptly and he brought a to-go box without us even asking. We will definitely be back and would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I really like the cobb or chef salad.... very well presented and perfect amount of bacon, hard boiled eggs, and all the good salad fixin's. It was a beautiful salad!"}
{"text":"Dearest girlfriend, why did you not tell me about this place before hand?  K O'Donnell's is definitely your destination for game day.  The amount of televisions they have will provide close to 30-40 games throughout the college day and will have every game on Sundays for the NFL.  Came here for the Baylor watch party.

Service was pretty solid the entire way and the wings were epic with the grill finish.  They weren't crushing and just flavored very well.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich was also solid.  I'm not sure I'd come here outside of that, but the selection of libation and fare was lovely.  I'll be back on another game day for sure though."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place for lunch and happy hour. The food and drinks are always top notch. The servers and owners take the time to know who you are. This is the best sports bar in scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, brunch very abundant amount of food. Loved the eggs, potatoes, sourdough bread. Great drinks, atmosphere ok."}
{"text":"Great place for yeasty pizza crust and rubbin' elbers with folks who find Outback Steakhouse too snooty."}
{"text":"Came here for the trivia on a Wednesday. Nice atmosphere. They have a lot of flat screen tvs playing sports so I would probably go here to catch a game. Not sure if they play any PPV fights. 

Although the happy hour choices were a bit smaller than other establishments, what they offered were of good quality. They also had some good beer."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed by the rude and snotty hostess staff that greeted us just moments ago as we arrived to watch the super bowl. No hello or smile just, \"Do you have a reservation\". No, we didnt! Who would think to need a reservation for a sports bar or need one for a sports bar running a shuttle back and forth from the Open. Many open seats and empty spaces in the parking lot. What a total joke!"}
{"text":"On Wednesday and for our lunch break, my colleague suggested we go to K O'Donnell. She's been there many times before and I haven't yet so we decided to go. Although many restaurants around our office area are usually kind of full between 1-2, I was shocked to find the restaurant almost entirely full at 12:30pm on a weekday, & most people looked like they were not on lunch breaks! 

We were asked to wait by the entrance for a few min and then we were seated. The menu is not extensive but has good options. Appetizers, soups and salads, burgers, sandwiches, and main dishes, etc. at first, I was gonna go for a burger with fries, but when I found out from my colleague that they were beer battered, I started looking at the menu again and this is when I saw the fajitas! I've been craving fajitas for a while and I wanted to try fajitas at a new place as I have still not yet found my absolute favorite. I ordered the steak fajitas, I was asked how I would like it cooked, I asked for medium. I then asked for no cheese or refried beans which are two of the many sides that usually come with a fajita. 

The food came out pretty quick considering how full the place was! My dish was absolutely delicious. It came with a big dollop of guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes & lettuce. It also came with a lot of rice which. I honestly did not like the rice. It was mushy and cold so I didn't eat it. The fajitas were also served with 4 tortillas, not the usual 3! The portion was just the right size. The food was really great with all the sides. The steak fajitas were $14 which is not too bad. Service was very good and fast so we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Best bar food! Absolutely recommend! Great menu and separate dining area if you don't want to hang at the bar.  You will not go away hungry.  Always have great service!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Food was pretty good, bartenders were attentive and the prices are average for Scottsdale.  

Cons:
Place is crawling with senior citizens and our conversation was interrupted by a very loud public trivia game hosted by the staff. No one seemed to be playing and it was hard to relax with a loud woman blasting her voice over her microphone."}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to watch the SJ Sharks playoff game.  We were seated immediately.  Friendly and extremely attentive staff.  They switched 2 of the 25+ TVs to the game and brought a sound box to our table so we could listen to our game.  

The menu is broad pub food executed VERY well.  The salads had marinated artichokes and other fixings. The french dip had a crusty roll that did not disintegrate plus grilled mushrooms and melted cheese.

We hung out for 3 hours and were never rushed to to finish or order more (we had 2 drinks each).  I also loved that the staff helped each other, so when our server got busy, others came by to ask if we needed anything.  

A huge positive surprise for out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Went again to this place last night for a little happy hour with my networking group. We reserved the semi-private back room for our group that would easily hold about 25-30. They had a few food items on happy hour $4 special; potato skins, bruchetta (I had this and it was a decent sized plate) and queso dip and chips. I decided to order the Chicken Pesto sandwich with the sweet potato fries for dinner; it was very good and I shared with my husband and it was filling for both of us. Our waitress was nice too; a bit slow, but the place was busy so that's just how it goes plus at about 2 min. till end of happy hour she stopped for \"happy hour last call\" so that was nice too. The reviews are all over the board for this place, it may just depend on the day or the wait staff - but for us it was good."}
{"text":"Great place to watch football on Sunday.  Food is better than typical bar food.  Lots of salads on the menu.  Also a kids menu and nice, friendly servers.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan. Particularly of the brunches! They bake their pancakes which makes them ooooh so good. The King's cakes are delicious and are baked with bananas and chocolate in them and served with peanut butter (which I'm personally not a fan of). The portions are very very generous. On a nice day, the patio is great. Comfy seats, evap cooler outside, misting system. Most people don't know about their brunches I assume, since the entire place was empty when we were there at 10am. The dinners are great as well. The pulled pork sandwich and their pizzas are surprisingly good! It definitely has a commercial feel to it, but I believe it's a local business which I'm all for."}
{"text":"KO's is our favorite spot in town! Candace, Val, and Stephanie are all amazing and the reason we continue to come. The entire staff (servers, bartenders, kitchen, hostess, etc.) are all beyond friendly and professional. Anyone who has a terrible experience here was probably having a bad day to start with and should stay home!"}
{"text":"A solid ok.  Great location.  We were there on Trivia night - VERY loud - and busy.  But I expect a sports bar to be a bit louder.  Food was ok.  I had the Prime Rib Dip sandwich.  The meat - to me - tasted a bit old - not bad, just that it wasn't cut today - perhaps in the last day or so.  Wouldn't order it again.  Portions were large.  Dining companion ordered a barbecue chicken salad.  He only ate about 1/2 of it - said it was way over dressed.  He had also ordered cheese fries - quite a combo ;) - wasn't overly impressed... to me - they looked limp - but I didn't taste any so I can't comment.  Sodas were BIG and kept full.  Server removed items from the table without asking if we were done... one of my pet peeves.  ASK!  I am paying for it!  Just because I'm not actively eating/working with the food on the plate does not mean I'm done with it!  I'd go back again if friends wanted to go - but I'd probably not seek it out again based on this experience.  The Trivia seemed popular - but very slow moving - looked like 3 minute timers per question - and then a long delay between questions.  It would have driven me nuts to play!"}
{"text":"The most awesome beef and/or chicken fajitas plate ever! I lived in California all my life until I retired in AZ in February of this year.  I know Mexican food. The fajita plate is the most fresh and tasty plate I have ever had in all my life! Incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"K O'Donnells is almost like a diamond in the rough. It's not the flashiest place and looks like a typical bar and grill, but overall has solid food and a consistent experience. 

The grilled wings are delicious. The KO wings are a unique combination of cheese and buffalo sauce and I can't describe how satisfying they are if you are looking for a savory wing. I'm not going to lie, we go there strictly for the wings sometimes. 

The other food that I've tried has always been hot, fresh and tasty. Prices are pretty reasonable also. 

As far as ambiance, it's comfortable. When I've gone with the hubs, it's never been crazy packed, which is sometimes a welcome change to really loud and busy restaurants where you get ignored or forgotten about. The service at KO's has always been great- everyone has been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm taking my rating down from 5 to 3 stars because K O'Donnell's food has been inconsistent the last couple of times I have been there.

 I was really disappointed with the Forgetaboutit pizza this past weekend. It looked to me that the cook forgot to put Italian Sausage on the pizza. The artichoke was cut in fourths instead of in tinier slices to be spread upon the pizza. Yes, I complained to the server. But she explained to me that the ingredients are measured out. I think that the cook was sloppy and lazy and sent me an inferior product. The server, who was new, had no concept of what this pizza should look like. In fact, I didn't see any of the old timer servers in the dinning room when I was there. They would have rectified the situation.

 I don't know why management didn't show up, they would have immediately known that the pizza was just not right. I've been going to K O's about once every 10 days; I am definitely cutting back on my patronage."}
{"text":"I am really conflicted about KO's.  It's right across the street from my gym and the happy hour prices and food are good.  I also love going in for the bottomless mimosas on Saturdays and Sundays.  The sandwiches are delicious, but overpriced. The waitresses are usually pretty unresponsive, but the bartenders seem to be okay service-wise.  They provide a drunk bus, which takes you home (up to 5 miles) and has to be its best feature!  Management is HORRIBLE, both to customers and servers.  I can't tell you how many times I've complained about chicken being undercooked and the management saying that it wasn't actually undercooked (who argues with customers over something like that?) or never coming to the table to apologize.  I've witnessed two different waitresses cry on two separate occassions because of management yelling at them.  I would also venture that the wings are probably some of the worst I've ever had.  They are grilled and usually burned, overly salted, void of taste (although the salt and burned chicken flavor tends to come through), and almost always pink inside. All-in-all, I would say going to watch football on Saturday and Sunday mornings is probably your best bet.  Going during Happy Hour, especially on trivia night, isn't the worst plan either. Other than that, you could do better."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Tv's everywhere, great food and the servers are awesome too. Not too bad on the eyes if I do say so myself. :) I always enjoy the pretzel bites and wings with an ice cold bud light! Great spot after a round of golf at the TPC or for NFL on Sunday's. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A great neighborhood joint without an ounce of pretension. And while it's a terrific little bar, the food is better than you'd imagine, with fresh ingredients and a nice menu. Service is always spot-on. Huge patio, heated in winter and air-conditioned in summer. They're friendlier than other spots, because they're local and one location."}
{"text":"Went to K O'Donnell's yesterday to watch college football and really enjoyed myself.  They have sound boxes so that you can hear your game and the bartenders are very attentive.  I had a salad which was very tasty.  

But the BEST thing about this place is that they have a free van that will pick you up from your house and take you back home when you are good and sauced.  This is a brilliant idea in a city where you have to drive 50 million miles to get anywhere and DUI checkpoints are every 10 feet.  BRILLIANT!"}
{"text":"We came here for the Derby last Saturday and had a blast. It was incredibly packed which we knew beforehand since it's an OTB bar. Food was delicious... the wings were bomb! They were grilled and tasted so good! The omelette from the AM (we were there for probably 6 hours) was huge and fulfilling... they ran out of hash browns sadly Andi wasn't a fan of the potatoes, but what can you do? Ordered a TON of beers (tall) and I believe they were only $6/each. Churros were a special for May 5th and those were delicious, too! The only downside was that our server was very hard to get ahold of and wasn't attentive at all. We understood it was packed, but even with that being said, our table was literally in the middle of everything and she still wasn't giving us any attention. Nonetheless, the restaurant itself deserves 5 stars. KO's is awesome"}
{"text":"Ok guys.. so everyone claims they have the best wings blah,blah,blah!!!!! wait these guys really do have great wings!!! Whoop, whoop!!! It's about time I find good wings nice and crispy with good flavor and not full of grease they toss them on the grill so you have that little extra char flavor..
We had the Ko wings they came with lime slices I kind of thought what the heck but tried it wow very good...

They have a nice patio with misters its dog friendly.. 
They have  24 tv screens holly guacamole and that's only on the patio. They also have off track vetting here."}
{"text":"Cool place

Went on st pattys day so they had a limited menu. The food was good though. Great beer selection. 

The environment was a bit more than I had hoped for. More party than dinner. I'm sure due to the holiday. But in general, this seems like the place for young people to go and drink versus a nice sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel a surge of testosterone, that unmistakable wave of manliness washing over me, I go to the Scottsdale Gun Club. 
What's that got to do with K O'Donnell's?
Plenty.
After my testosterone ridden shooting session, I mosey on into K's, (less than a hundred feet from the Gun Club) for some brews and people watching, where both are above average.

The patio looks cool but I don't like going out there since there are a plethora of typical Scottsdale men, (douche-nozzles) sitting out there smoking what appear to be giant horse dicks. 

The food, mainly bar fare, is good, but the chicken sandwich is terrific. The ambiance is friendly and the bartenders are attentive. 
Not \"I'll listen to how screwed-up your life is and pretend like I give-a-shit\" attentive, more like refilling my beer when I still have half a glass remaining. 

They're also skilled at knowing when to cut you off and politely ask you to leave when they hear you bragging about how you just won forty dollars from some guy in the men's room for target peeing into a cup from four feet away. 

One would think that would get you a free beer.
I guess times are changing."}
{"text":"Finally a place in Scottsdale that gets it. The food is fantastic and it won't cost you your first born. I had the Reuben and my wife had the chicken salad. Both were served fast and both were very tasty. I like the neighborhood feel. This place understands customer service. Every one was attentive and nice. Its definitely got a buzz to it, with a full bar and 3/4 full restaurant. I saw the pizza and wings, which looked amazing. 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hard to say much about this experience pleased me. We got there later on at night, around 10pm or so, and waited at the door for at least 5 minutes (by the please wait to be seated sign) before deciding to walk up to the bartender. She said, ''Oh, sit anywhere,\" and handed us menus. So we headed outside, picked a table, and then sat for about 10 minutes before anyone came up to us. When a server finally did come up, she was far from pleasant, seemed more annoyed than anything that we were there, and took our order. Food came fast, but was sub-par, and then we sat and waited again for her to even check on us. Let's just say her tip reflected it."}
{"text":"So I am new to this Yelp site and haven't made much of an effort to share my thoughts previously. But I do want to give a shout out to KO's, which has been one of my favorites in the nine years I have lived in Scottsdale. The food has consistently been fantastic. I will always bring family and friends to KO's for the atmosphere, incredible patio experience and the food. Gotta try the Grown Up Grilled Cheese; growing up in the Midwest... You understand! :) The Prime Rib Wrap is a great lunch or dinner choice and I am a big fan of the Southwest Salad with Cajun Chicken. Hmmm... I think I made up my mind for dinner tonight :)"}
{"text":"Delicious wings and burgers! Quick and friendly service - Samantha W goes above and beyond. Trivia nights on Wednesday's is fun too. Dog friendly patio with fireplaces : )"}
{"text":"Terrible drinks and mediocre food. Was not impressed at all!  It was pretty empty too so I must not be the only one with this opinion."}
{"text":"This place is worth the money spent. Got a pulled pork sandwich and it was so good! Do not order the frozen margaritas however. I would recommend they take them off the menu as the manager doesn't even recommend. They do however have good on the rocks margaritas. Service was ok, had a new waitress. Owner personally came up and asked if we were doing ok since the nasty frozen margaritas. He was cool! Made it seem like a family place. I will continue coming here"}
{"text":"I live/work in this general area and frequent KO's all the time. They have a great food menu with a lot of options. We stop in for lunch appointments and come by for happy hour after work. I also come on the weekends to watch football on the dog friendly patio. They've expanded the seating area and added more TVs to the patio this season which is great because it tends to get busy during happy hour and Sunday Funday. 

They're Sunday brunch menu is small but exceptional. Love the new Build your own Bloody Marys for $5!

Don is one of the working managers that comes by to check on all of their guests. He is awesome, he doesn't just stop by once for the standard manager inquiry \"How was everything today? THanks for coming in!\" He will generally pop by a few times to ensure drinks are filled and food was good in addition to the friendly waiters/waitresses. It's always nice to know that they genuinely care about their patrons. 

Love this bar/restaurant. Keep up the great work KOs!"}
{"text":"What can I say...I really like this place for an after-work hangout.  The patio is awesome and draft prices are pretty solid.  The real winner here is their grilled chicken wings.  As far as wings go these have some of the best flavor in the valley.  The live music is a great intention but gets a little loud when you're trying to hang out and talk with friends."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've learned that certain experiences are better dependent upon the company you keep. For me, I had the opportunity to enjoy KO's with the two most recent Kings of Phoenix.

We met on a weeknight, the three of us. I had been told of a kind of \"party bus\" that would pick you up from your location, as well as deliver you back to your point of origin. On this night, however, the bus' services were not needed. I planned on being at KO's long enough to ensure that the beer or two I enjoyed would be well out of my system (though, knowing that the \"Get out of jail free\" bus was available was quite comforting).

We sat around the sizable bar, and enjoyed one another's company while we took in one of, what appeared to be, a dozen televisions (all seeming to be airing some brand of Chicago-based sporting event). I'm not sure if the latter was a coincidence, but, regardless...there seem to be many different angles from which one could view their sporting event of choice.

We ordered a few samples from their menu, which is composed of typical bar fare. Between the three of us, we split onion rings, french fries, and potato skins. In all my years of legal drinking, I've yet to come across a place that could screw up any of the three aforementioned items. Thankfully, that streak is still in tact. Couple those items with a nice Sierra Nevada IPA, and you're pretty much golden!

As we sat and conversed, I noticed behind me that there was an in-house poker tournament going on. After talking with my compatriots, I learned that KO's runs a few in-house tournaments a year, with a grand prize of a seat at the WSOP in Las Vegas. I'm not sure if there's a buy-in for the in-house tournaments, but I'm certainly planning on finding out!

For me, my experience at KO's was as good a bar experience as I've had. The food and beer were both priced reasonably. The selection of beers on tap was quite nice, as well. Couple that with the covered patio and the year-round poker tournament, and you've got yourself a winner, in my book!

But, like I said before, it's all about the company you keep. Any place can be five stars if you enjoy it with friends!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Meet some friends there on the patio and everybody had a great time."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was awesome, we had a great time!! Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a good place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy eating at K O'Donnells.  The food is consistently good.  Last evening we took two friends with us to dinner.  The restaurant was crowded, but we were greeted and seated quickly.  We placed our orders, and it too a while for our food to come, which was fine, because it was a busy Saturday night.  Once the food arrived, my friend noticed that his tater tots were cold and asked if they could be reheated.  Unfortunately they forgot to bring out my burger.  At least a half dozen times, the waiter came to the table to tell me my food was coming with no explanation as to why I didn't receive it in the first place. The manager also stopped by the table to reassure me that my food was coming, and to apologize and say they would not charge us for the burger. 15-20 minutes into our meal I received my burger.  Everyone sat around as I ate my meal alone.  It was delicious, but no explanation was ever given as to why I didn't get my meal at the same time as everyone else.  When the bill came, there was no deduction in our bill for any inconvenience.  Apparently the manager neglected to inform the waiter, and the waiter, who never offered an apology or explanation just delivered our invoice intact.  I guess ordering a burger without a bun was just to big a deal for the kitchen to get it right.  Needless to say I am disappointed at the service we received, and, though O'Donnells is our go to place, there are many other restaurants to enjoy in the area that I will definately take into consideration the next time we want to grab a burger."}
{"text":"Came to this place today with high expectations and exited to try there food. Started with our waitress katelyn who looked like didn't care. I understand some time servers get busy but come on once you're at a table take the time to introduce your self. A different waitress came by \"shelby\" and introduce her self and was kind to take our drink order before \"our waitress\" even said a word to our table... Well food was OK. I asked our waitress if this was the kind of service they offer on daily basis. She said they cut everyone and im the only one with 12 tables. LET ME TELL YOU THAT IF YOU'RE IN THIS BUSINESS AND CANT HANDLE YOUR TABLES WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS BUSINESS? Stop wasting your time go back to school or something. I asked her when was the best time to come and get good costumer service SHE REPLIED NOT TODAY SPECIALLY NOT NOW... Very glad one of the owners came by and asked if everything was fine. I explain what was going on and hopefully he'll straightens her out... Its sucks to be treated differently... Felt discriminated with this waitress.  WE'RE NOT COMING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Dear Sports Bar Elves, please open up a sports bar like this in other locations (like Old Town) around the Valley. The end. Ok not really, but I do wish more sports bars like these existed around town. K O'Donnell's is the perfect mixture of sports bar meets grill. There are plenty of locations to sit and enjoy a meal, but there are tvs everywhere you turn so if someone wants to watch a game they can do so. In addition to the grill, there is a large bar area with a spacious patio, plus they even have a back room dedicated to poke and with plenty of poke tables. 

The food here is good and better than average bar food. The bruschetta is delicious and should be called garlic, cheesy, fluffy bruschetta. I had the Cobb salad which was also tasty and combined a side of blue cheese dressing with the balsamic vinaigrette. This is definitely an excellent choice for weekend night drinks or weekday happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 4 stars because in the handful amount of times I've been, I've never been disappointed either with the food, or temperature of the beer :) 

Even better, the first place in AZ I've found that has a \"Taco Tuesday\" (Which means dollar something oversize taco's for all you who don't know)

One thing really blew my mind about this place though, the crabcakes

HUH???

Perhaps it was Mr. Daniels talking but when we got our crabcakes as an appetizer they were not only cooked perfectly but tasted pretty amazing considering were sitting in the middle of the desert and your average run of the mill establishment.

Being in my careless state I failed to ask (but pretty much know the answer to it anyways) if the crabcakes were brought in or made in house, being that my assumption is brought in, whoever their supplier is sure knows how to make a good one!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for about 2 years because it was close by and had decent food.  The wait staff has always been extremely great and very pleasant.  Unfortunately I will never go to this place ever again and will tell everyone I know to do the same.  Their food has gotten extremely bad...too much salt on the all breakfast food and everything else is not cooked properly.  They just put out a new menu and raised their prices by over a dollar.  Pretty sure he did that because of his other failed businesses...a mortgage company that tanked along with other real estate investments.  They don't take reservations...or I was told that when I called to make some.  So we showed up an hour early to get a good seat for the football game.  I sat at a table and then I was told to move because someone had reservations.  So we moved to another table.  Then at this table we were told to move again because of reservations.  Then we finally got a table in their back room.  So we were all watching the football games and enjoying our overpriced food and watered down drinks.  Then with about 5 minutes left to go in the game we were told that we had to leave because someone else had reservations at our table and the Owner and Manager didn't even have the guts to tell us this themselves.  They made a tiny 19yr old girl come up to 10 guys to tell them to move.  She started to cry because she felt so bad to tell us and still no help from management.  Completely classless establishment.  We offered to share our table but they wanted us to move somewhere else entirely.  If that wasn't enough, my wife and her friend were out on the patio getting some air and over heard the owner talking badly about us using profanity all over. What a classy man talking about the people who keep him in business.  What's the funniest part of everything.....the people that wanted the reservations weren't even eating or drinking."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch games on TV during recent trip to Scottsdale. Went to O'Donnell's right after playing 18 holes of golf and had very nice lunch and watched NFL game.

Very passionate fans in attendance and food was surprisingly good. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great Pub in North Scottsdale. Good selection on beer. Barkeep does good job of handling everyone. Food is good."}
{"text":"I've been going to KO's for years... well in all honesty, before it was KO's.  My friends and I would meet there 2-3 nights a week and play Golden Tee (or whatever game was there).  When the place was purchased by KO back in 2005, I was worried that I lost my neighborhood hangout.  And luckily that didn't happen.  He kept on a few of our favorite staff, and changed the place for the better.  So we continued to call KO's our \"go-to\" place for food and sports.  

Aside from the great food, there was always something more that kept us coming back.  I can say a lot of it had to do with the bartenders and the servers.  They make the place what it is.  I am a huge Niners fan and seeing all the Niner paraphernalia is great.  Some of it was the other patrons.  We became good friends with the other people that seemed to frequent there as much as we did.

Fast forward to 2013 and I still go there.  Mind you, my friends are all moved on (mostly out of state) but the staff and the regulars, while not all the same, are pretty close.  I have seen the menu change several times over the years, and let me tell, you, it just gets better and better.  The daily food specials are usually the best choice.  I remember when the menu was HUGE!  There were so many great options, its a wonder I don't weigh 600 pounds from trying everything.  Even with the menu now, while smaller, still offers plenty of great items to choose from.  

The remodel of the patio a few years ago literally changed the face of the place.  It has one of the best patio in the Valley to visit (even if your are bringing your dog).  I think they have 8 TVs outside now so technically, one could watch all the broadcasted football games outside.  

Overall, I've enjoyed watching KO's grow to be the place that I still consider my \"go-to\" place.  When anyone asks, \"Where's a good place to eat in Scottsdale?\"  I will always say K O'Donnell's."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  The food is great and it's perfect to enjoy any sports game.  The food was great and is kid friendly."}
{"text":"Been a regular customer since the day they opened!  I've just started to Yelp, as I'm usually on TripAdvisor.  But I wanted to give a shout out to Kevin and Jennifer, as they have a wonderful place to go to, whether it's for that noon-hour \"business lunch\" or coming in with my Wife Debi on Wednesdays or Thursdays, bringing in our whole gang for a special occassion or our out of town guests visiting from parts back east in FL, IN, PA, MD or wherever!  The food is most always very good, the wait staff, especially Ben, is very attentive, yet doesn't smother you!  Thanks Jennifer, for being that \"neighborhood place\" to go to and hang out!  Wishing you guys many more years of success!"}
{"text":"Ok -- K'ODonnell's

Needless to say my experience so far is yes I've been to a more exciting bar & grill in my lifetime.  There wasn't anything special that grabbed my attention at this place.  Sports flair and LCD TVs are great, but food is what pops in my report.

I ordered the Rueben sandwich with sweet potato fries.  I was one hungry man!  I didn't think it was bad, but then again it wasn't good either.  The rye bread was extra crunchy on the edges as well as the middle.  There really wasn't much taste in my opinion except the overpowering onions that really helped moisturize the beef patty because it was pretty dry.  My friend ordered their fajitas which came in several different compartments.  She had to eat a certain way based on her diet and I did remember her saying no tortilla; they came anyways.  

Overall, again it was bad, but not good.  I think K O is better left for having drinks and watching the game.  However, if I wanted to add some food to that mix then sorry I'll have to pass. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"1 word fish and chips...ok that's 3 words. The service was awesome and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"I think this sports bar is one of the better ones around the North Scottsdale area. Mainly because it's nearby! Good food and beer. I always like their grilled hot wings but the wings have gotten smaller over the years."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and enjoyed my meal.

The meatball sandwich had lots of tasty meatballs and a nice tomato sauce.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.

This is a convenient place for lunch if you are in the Airpark.

I'll have to give them a try for happy hour in the future."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in my life. 5 star food,  5 star service, and best place to watch games in town."}
{"text":"Food is alright but ambiance needs some work. If you are looking for bare bones sports bar this is your spot."}
{"text":"Just got back to he office after tearing lunch here today.  Already not feeling well.  I had the ultimate ko dip with slaw and it was not good.  Iced tea was old."}
{"text":"KO's is pretty cool. It's a solid bar to watch a game at or have Sunday Funday at. They have a good patio, and decent food as well. Nothing overly memorable, but as far as bars are concerned are they ever memorable? They also have the little bus to take you home when you drink too much, which if you live here you know how important that is. I've lived close to them for 6 years, I go about 2-3 times a year. Definitely a solid bar to visit."}
{"text":"We have ALWAYS had a good time here! BEST PATIO IN TOWN! (& usually the best staff too!)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite bar in AZ! Love the beer selection! I can always count on an ice cold local beer after a hard days work! The patio is dog friendly and always full of lovable regulars. Food is absolutely amazing..especially the grilled cheese sandwich!! A must visit place during any sporting event. Rock on KOs!!!"}
{"text":"Good spot to watch games, food is just ok. They have a nice patio area with heaters. We were visiting from Las Vegas, but will not be back."}
{"text":"Low-key dress down inexpensive drinks Leanne the waitress was great nice patio sports on multiple TVs tough to go wrong here potato skins were fine."}
{"text":"Family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids under 8) on spring break...we were going to hit up a pizza/salad restaurant nearby, but decided on this place after I saw you can eat outdoors (we are from cold Chicago & eating outdoors is a priority when you're in this kind of weather)!

I'll break it down into categories:

ATMOSPHERE: 
It's nice to have option to eat outdoors and they also allow people to bring their dogs (I'm allergic to them & it's not really my thing at a restaurant, but the two dogs we saw were well behaved, on leashes & fine).
The outdoor area has couches, big screen TVs, high tops and regular tables.
I wouldn't call the area outside clean, by any means.  We had to switch the chair my son was going to sit on because it had sticky stuff all over the cushion.  There were stains all over the bench cushions & inevitable leaves falling from the trees blowing in the wind.
Caveat:  they allow cigar smoking on the patio.  We tried to be seated farthest away from the stogie smokers, but the downwind prevailed & my kids were complaining about the smell.   We could've went inside at this point, but like I said, we come from the cold and even though the cigar stench was disgusting, we sucked it up just so we could enjoy dining outside.  Whatddya gonna do?

FOOD: 
Standard kids' meal options: burgers, grilled cheese, Mac & cheese, quesadillas, chicken tenders (grilled or breaded) and a few others.

Kids got Mac '& cheese with fruit/fries and chicken tenders...meh....kid food at a bar...enough said.  We asked for chocolate milk...it tasted like they dumped the whole bottle of Hershey's syrup into it...even kids didn't drink it.

Hubby and I split the 10pc wings...5 KO special sauce & 5 buffalo; they were crispy on outside and delicious/meaty on inside...right amount of spice too.  They charged $3.99 for extra plate of celery/carrots though.
I read on Yelp someone raved about garlic wings...I asked waitress about them & she didn't know anything about it, but was sweet enough to ask us if we wanted to create our own sauce 'cuz the restaurant has garlic powder, etc..we passed.
I also had the salad wedge after reading a good review on Yelp...it's just a wedge of iceberg lettuce, people...add a few tomatoes, bacon bits and bleu cheese crumbles and there ya go...nothing to rave about...dressings were too thick & sort of bland...taste bottled.

Hubby had the pesto chicken sandwich and scarfed it down, so I'm guessing he liked it.

SERVICE:
Very friendly, accommodating (brought us extra napkins without asking, extra cups for kids) and quick.
Food came out in a timely manner.

The place reminded me of a sports bar that sponsored teams (soccer, softball, baseball) would go to after they were done playing.  Not really a place for small children (cigar smoke, loud TVs, lots of beer).
Try the wings, they were very tasty & cooked well!"}
{"text":"Great patio! When we went there, they had all sports games playing on multiple tvs, and a great big fire in the fireplace ... great food and great service every time!"}
{"text":"These people are great. On a business trip and needing a place to watch the Cubs playoffs and eat a good meal and this place delivered three  nights for me and the Cubs won each night I was there. Fun place, good food and the service was great. Will come back."}
{"text":"Had a great time tonite at KOs. Been in here  a few times and the service is always spot on.  Even if it isn't their customer, the servers always drop off and pick up stuff from your table. 

After Happy Hour on the patio,  we moved inside...great choice by my friend, Andy, as the bartenders, Laura and Jane/Jen(sorry, not sure) were awesome!!!  Great pair of employees.  Fun, engaging, and fast....

My only issue is that the men's restroom floor is filthy.   Looks like it hasn't been mopped in 3 weeks.

Keep up the great work!  This place kicks ass."}
{"text":"Wow, it's time to update this review.  Since I moved to the area, KO's has been one of our regular watering holes.  We absolutely love this place.  Here's why:

+ Friendly staff.  The bartenders, servers, and managers are super friendly and always stop by to say hello at our table.

+ The food.  Pizza, Wings, Sandwiches, Burgers....we've had so many things on the menu, It's hard to figure out which one is our favorite.  If I had to pick a couple, it would be the Fuh-getta-bout-it Pizza and the Turkey Bacon Melt.....seriously though, the food is superb.

+ They have a cool patio area.  There's a large AC unit out back and misters to keep you cool during the summer months and a heater to keep you warm during the winter.  The patio is the place to be sometimes.

+ The offer a complimentary shuttle to drive you home.  Don't want to drive?  No problem, call up KO's to pick you up.  Had a little too much to drink and don't want a DUI?  No problem, ask them to take you home and they'll do it free of charge.  There's of course a radius of how far they'll drive, but if you live nearby you're in the zone.

Overall, this is a solid bar that we love coming to on a regular basis.

Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"We had a large surprise birthday party here and everything was outstanding. We were given a private room with tables that sat all of us comfortably. Beyond that, we got a ton of appetizers that were not only fantastic but also warm and perfect. From the mozzarella sticks, wings, sliders and hummus this place is fantastic. Our waitress was sweet, funny and prompt. I know large parties can be stressful for staff but she handled it perfectly! I will be coming back for the amazing food and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Outstanding local place with expansive menu, friendly servers, excellent libations and a clean, comfortable environment!  We brought 4 adults and 5 kids ranging from 7-14 in age and it was awesome. Can't recommend it enough!

Awesome collection of TVs with every game and multiple events being shown. Indoor and outdoor seating. 

Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed this place! All of the staff is friendly and helpful. I would like to recognize Stephanie today for her great personality and choice of wing sauce. Please keep up the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was EXCELLENT - pizza, green chile pork burrito, kids grilled cheese with bomb.com fries. The owner was extremely friendly and checked on us several times, which was great because our server was nowhere to be found the whole time. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about K'O Donnell's is their amazing patio! When the weather is nice this is an awesome place to hang out.  For a sports bar the food is awesome. From the prime rib wrap to the southwest salad you cannot go wrong with any menu choice. They also have a fair amount of beers on tap which is always a plus. My only complaint is sometimes the service can be pretty slow. That being said the waitresses are friendly. As someone who works nearby this is one of my favorite places to hang out after work. Keep being awesome K'O's !"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've had 9 different dishes from their menu and each one was outstanding. My latest favorite is their salmon salad."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I often find ourselves here.  We often go at nights and sit in large groups on the patio, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the food every time I've gone.  It's all delicious and flavorful, typical bar food, but executed flawlessly.  Nachos, pulled pork sandwiches, burgers, fish and chips...  I've never been disappointed!

I love the fact that the patio is dog-friendly -- I wish I could bring my dog, but she's an unsocialized rescue, and we're still working on her dog-meeting manners.  Maybe someday!

I've only had one bad experience with the service where I asked multiple times for rolls that were supposed to come with my dish, but they never came.  The waitress seemed new and a little frazzled, however, so I didn't hold it against her.  I think she was more embarrassed than anything, and I tipped her well anyway.  This has only happened once out of my many visits, and people make mistakes, so I'm not going to deduct any stars for this single experience.  All the other wait staff I've been served by have been spot-on, which is impressive since I usually come with a large group.

Overall, I like this establishment a lot.  Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and awesome food!  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. The restaurant it self was nice. Overall. Decent place other than the high prices and the rude waitress. I had the fish and chips, the fish was below average and the fries tasted like they had been frozen and reheated. Overall, an okay place. Not the best, not the worst. 3/5 star. For a fraction of the price you can find a much better place with tastier food. Can I recommend McDonald's?"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but is a decent choice for a sports bar in the Airpark.   

The food I have had here has been fine....not remarkable adequate.  Prices are about right for dinner but seem a tad high for lunch (it's the same menu.)

I would not describe it as super family friendly....it's a bar and it smells and looks a bit like like one....which is fine if you expect that.   This is a sports bar; go their for drinks.

 So you may want to leave the kids at home or head to Zipps.  The food and the atmosphere at Zipps are actually better all the way around if there is one close by.  (Although I like the patio better here.)

A big plus I will comment on, the owner pays attention to and responds to YELP comments.  If I was going to a sports bar in the Airpark, this is where I would go."}
{"text":"I ordered grilled chicken wings with they us grill marks on them but were fried crispy on the menu it says grilled 

Then I hear the waitress tell the hostess to keep an Eye out for the guy so he doesn't walk out and don't pay well isn't that nice just because I have a white shirt a blue shorts on on my day off make me a guy who steals. The hostess told the waitress Caitlin we will hustle him. I work at as a server and let me tell u false advertising is one thing but  accusing me of stealing is another 

Thanks Caitlin"}
{"text":"I absolutely love KOs. In the spirit of full transparency, this place is like the Poor Richards of my office (S/O to my fellow Office lovers if you got the reference). We go to KOs all the time - I always have solid service, good food, cold drinks. 

Price is reasonable. Try to sit out on the patio if it's nice. It's a great place to watch a game and they have trivia during the week. I honestly have nothing but positive things to say about KOs so you should just go and grab a drink now!"}
{"text":"From reading all the other reviews that rave about the food, I feel I might have set myself up for failure. The Prime Rib Wrap was pretty good, but I was the unlucky got that got a lot of the fatty tough meat. The flavoring and cooking temp where spot on, I think I just got the bad spot in the roast.

I'm the guy that always orders straight horseradish because I like the heat. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that their creamed horseradish had the perfect blend of heat and smooth creaminess. 

The french fries you can tell are freshly handcut in house. Unfortunately, they were soggy from the frying oil. I might have just had a bad luck experience. 

I will tell you though, the service was fantastic. Because of the service and some the positive attributes of the food, I will give this place another try. I suspect that I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a chilly night for AZ. I think it was 62. Right! They had a fireplace going which made it that much more enjoyable. The service was a bit sticky slow. But the crowd was fun. I had the turkey club with provolone on sourdough. It was thick slices of juicy bird. The slaw and sweet potato fries hit the spot. we also sat at the bar for a few and the atmosphere was a bit more lively and the service much improved."}
{"text":"Pretty average sports bar. Went here over the lunch hour for a meeting and it was dead. 

The buffalo chicken salad was pretty good but had way too much cheeses on it. Kind of defeated the purpose of a \"fresh salad\". 

I drive by here at night quite often and see the porch packed."}
{"text":"I can always count on Brunch at KO's. Something for everyone!
Great service, great food ! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love,  love,  love  this spot!!!!  More importantly, Joe is the BOMB!  He is attentive, funny, and on top of it all.  Everyone here was smiling and making us all feel wanted!!!  THANK YOU!!!  We will return!!!"}
{"text":"This place has one of my favorite patios ever! It's spacious and has a fireplace for when it's cold outside (I know, not often - but I still love it!)  Their house made veggie burger is awesome and the sauteed mushrooms & siracha aioli make it even better.  And any place that has a \"grown up\" grilled cheese on their menu is a winner in my book!  The service here is also exceptional. I know I said I love the patio, but if you sit at the bar, the bartenders are always amazingly friendly & quick."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, outstanding service, outstanding ambiance. This place shits on Buffalo Wild Wings! This is our go-to place! Tater tots are amazing and so are the sliders - I haven't had anything disappointing here. They also have a vast menu of drinks and cool events."}
{"text":"Jessica does a great job! She is always a nice smiling and friendly face to get an ice cold beer feom!"}
{"text":"Stephanie is such a peach and oh so wonderful, shes always super attentive and gets our drinks to us so quickly!! Shes very helpful with the menu and giving us her opinion. One of the best sports bars i have been too. Wings are just to die for. Stephanie bartends, but sometimes can serve so when you go there ask where shes at and sit with her!!!!"}
{"text":"After going here at least once a week for the past three months, I figure it's probably time to write a review.

Service is always awesome. Sometimes, I want to drink like a fish, and KOs really enables my poor life decisions. Along with a party bus that takes you home when you're plastered for no charge, they're always really good at bringing me water when I ask for it. That's super important to me, since I'm never choosing to get drunk on purpose anywhere that isn't going to help me stave off a headache the next day with lots of water.

I'm a picky eater. I probably drive a lot of servers crazy (sorry, food service industry). KOs always has something I can eat, which is a tall order for bar food. Also a tall order: decent salads. KOs has several salads that I've highly enjoyed, and the portions are large enough (and packed with enough protein and toppings) to be a full meal. I usually order anything with their chipotle ranch dressing. It's Arizona, I need decent spicy food. KOs always delivers.

Speaking of which, their wings! Oh man, I love good wings. If you're a spicy food aficionado, their volcano wings are definitely something to write home about. They're always huge, cooked all the way through, packed with plump juicy white meat, and seasoned perfectly. They grill them, which is not something you see at every bar. It's that extra touch that really pushes them over the top from good to great with those nice charred bits and authentic grilled taste. Their buffalo style wings are also amazing, if you're not into burning your mouth for fun like I am.

I've also tried their burgers, which are 100% meat all the way through. I can't stand people that put weird stuff in burgers. KOs doesn't, and they always grill them too.

They're also pretty handy with that frier. Their handmade potato chips are excellent with a side of ranch, and the sweet potato fries always go over well with friends. Never had anything that wasn't cooked right, even when they get super busy.

What I really like about KOs, though, is that their servers are always friendly, and they'll remember what you order and who you are. I always prefer family-owned establishments for that individual touch, and KOs is great at it. I've never had a server that wasn't totally on top of his or her game, or had no idea what they were doing. Hey, if I'm getting stupid on a Saturday night out, I don't need a stupid server or bartender on top of it. I don't know what they do to retain such great staff, but keep it up!

There's always something going on here too. Trivia nights are loads of fun, and everyone gets super competitive. They have more televisions than almost any bar in town, so they're excellent for watching MMA or anything else you want. They do charge cover on the nights of big games, but they'll give you back your cover in the form of \"KO Bucks\" you can spend on whatever you want. That's a nice touch.

Their patio is really large, and dog-friendly. I don't have a dog, but I gather that's a huge plus for some people. The seats are actually clean and comfortable, which can be hard to find in this town. Their mister / fan system is really extensive, so I've had no trouble staying for three or four hours on a summer afternoon. When it's cold, they have heaters that put out quite a bit of heat. Plus, the patio area always has at least four televisions within view, no matter where you sit. I drink a lot with smokers, although I don't smoke myself, so it's important that we get all the amenities outside that we can get inside.

The one and only thing I don't like is their beer list. It's great if you like the staples like Bud and Coors, but it's pretty terrible if you're a snooty craft beer person like me. They usually have maybe a San Tan or Four Peaks available, but that's pretty much it for local stuff. You're not going to find anything exotic like whitbier, oktoberfiest, framboise, or cider. And forget about smaller craft breweries or seasonal taps.

I don't really come here for craft beer, so I guess it's okay. I usually stick to whiskey, and they've never not had what I ask for when it comes to hard liquor. Their mixed drinks are always good, and never cheap on the pours. My SO really likes their oatmeal cookie shots, and another friend of mine was impressed by the margaritas. I've never ordered a shot and got back a thimble. That's appreciated.

Honestly, the food is good enough here that it's worth eating if you have no interest in drinking. And the drinking isn't bad either. I'd guess it's on the pricer side, but hey, it's North Scottsdale. I kind of expect it. That said, if you're looking for dive bar or neighborhood bar prices, you're not going to find them here.

I'll no doubt continue to be  a regular. Their parking is always accessible, and I've never had bad or slow service. And honestly, that's really all that it takes to impress me. That their food is really good on top of all that earns them 5-stars."}
{"text":"How cool that Jennifer responds to each and every review with individualized comments not a boilerplate reply.  She reads each review and her comments relate to what the reviewer had to say.  That really shows they care about what their customers think.  Good job KO's!"}
{"text":"Been here several times to watch games or the draft.  The best thing here are the KO's special/secret sauce wings.  Not overly tangy like buffalo wings.  Good flavor and pretty meaty.
I like that their pizzas are thin crust.  Good service."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars but they didn't have Tecate or Patron. Wings were great and service is excellent. Lots of TVs and fun folks to watch the Duke vs Syracuse NCAA game."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a hike and it was busy.  Dog friendly and we were bringing the dog which was why we chose KO's.  Staff were really really friendly and assured us a table was available soon on patio.  They offered us waters while we waited and soon enough we were lounging in patio watching final 4.  

Fried Mozzarella!!!  That's addicting
Wings were grill finished and awesome. 
Burgers good, pulled pork very good. 

A few people stopped by and asked if everything was good, food, etc... very attentive.  Keep that up and the great food and i'll definitely be back."}

{"text":"I've now been here twice in 2 weeks. Had a blast with some coworkers for lunch. Food is great and quick and the beer is cold - have some cool selections that you wouldn't expect. I ate the chicken pot pie my first time and it was huge and delicious. The next time I had the breakfast burger which was awesome - how can you go wrong with grilled onions, thousand island dressing, bacon and a fried egg."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here after walking out from terrible service at Zipps, this place deserves 5 stars all the way. Top notch service, great food and drink specials, they even had Bingo with with giveaways while eating.  This place was packed, definitely a new go to spot."}
{"text":"This great American restaurant is incredible. They are so well managed.  They are staffed to levels where hospitality is incredible. A great family orientated atmosphere. But if you like sports, believe me this is the place to see every game with excellent seats in the entire venue. I have been calling this my local for years and absolutely would recommend it.

This place has great prices and great service...to make matters worse/better it's super close to where I live!  Go hard at K-O's!"}
{"text":"Nice big bar so easy to get a seat during happy hour. I tried the steak and was happy. Nice pour on the drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple time and every time I go, I always get charged extra for things. One time the waiter dropped my friend's burger on the floor and charged us for a new one, another time I ordered cornbread as my side with my meal and it was an extra $5 that they didn't even mention or state on the menu. Food isn't that good and way too expensive to add extra charges to things without warning. I won't be coming back unless someone else is paying!"}
{"text":"KOs is one of my favorite places not only for the food but for the service. My husband and son cannot go a week without their chicken tenders tossed in wing sauce. The salads are fresh and served on chilled plates. It's a great place to watch a game and the walls are lined with TVs for every game. Nice cold tall beers and good selection for wines. Kristi is the most amazing person there and please ask for her. She will make your experience so great you will not be able to wait to come back"}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare!! I guess you have to be a regular to get  a decent experience.  Lived in area for over three years and each time we go, we have some type of issue. Have spoke to the owner before... guessing it's just the day you show up, time, full moon or not? It's a crap shoot! Sunday night, husband has to work, but kindly he stops for a large pizza that's ordered. Well do you think we got a large pizza? A gentleman come out with a small and says...\"well sorry\". If you want to wait... we can make another? At this point maybe offer my husband a beer on the house? For the wait? Nope, at this point the customer service was lacking, my husband was tired, and said I guess my family will have to manage with a small. Do you think the guy would have just said take the pizza, to make up for the mix up? 

Husband walks in with the tiny pizza and the kids are like #%&@!! WTF!! Quickly I make a salad and say it's ok.... I proceed to open the box and let's just say the topping are non existent...hubby tells me the story and I say please tell you at least didn't have to pay for this!!!!!

This establishment has no idea of what true customer service is. This concept is foreign to the revolving door of employees at K O'Donnell's. Don't let the good reviews fool you, I think they pay their employees or regulars for them...and we must not be one of them!
My husband says he bets his \"left nut\" the management never responds! I took the bet... a Gino's East pizza is riding on it!"}
{"text":"The place to go in Scottsdale for great bar and home cooked food. Fantastic since they opened over ten years ago. 

Delicious, the best, actually, Reubens. And all of their salads are fantastic.

If the waiter Connor is there, request him. He's one in a million."}
{"text":"Just visited here today for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised. Very friendly service, nice looking place, fast service at lunchtime. 

I had the reuben and it was really good. The fries are wonderful. My bro had the cheeseburger sliders & I felt jealous...they looked so good and he said he gets them a lot because they are his favorite! 

I'd recommend this place if you're in the area. Fairly priced, great food!"}
{"text":"Been coming to KO's for breakfast and football for 2 years now. Great staff and great food. Couldn't ask for more!"}

{"text":"Decent sports bar as long as you are not a fan of AZ sports.  I went there to watch a Cardinals game and they had about 10 TV's, none of them on the Cardinals game and some transplant was hogging two TV's watching non-Cardinals games.  The food is pretty decent, service is good, but I am just not down with a place that doesn't promote local teams.  It is a sports bar full of transplants that like different teams, no thanks."}
{"text":"Was in town to watch a Rams and cardinals NFL game and stopped by to grab a bite to eat here. Staff was awesome and the food was delicious! Next time we are in town we will definitely stop by again!!! Thanks for the amazing service!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Came from out of town based on yelp reviews and how close it was to us. Mac n cheese, wings, bbq chicken salad and CHEESE FRIES!!!!! we loved it. Service was about as impeccable as it gets. Don't miss out on this one when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Wow...really enjoyed my hot pastrami while watching 3 pitches of a Cubs game before they called a rain delay. But there was no delay in my food arriving hot and fresh to my table since I was starving and drove from central Phoenix just to try K O'Donnels after finding you on Google. 
So My first time there and I'll give 4 stars! 
Maybe 5 after I come back and try the wings and see if the service is just as good as the first time. I actually sat at the bar and not a table...very happy to see all the TVs and awesome sports bar atmosphere. Loved my sandwich with good bread that could hold all that thick pastrami and some kind of mustard sauce without getting soggy. Fries were great too. The bar seemed to have regulars during the lunch hour and that made me feel like I was on the TV show Cheers. Of course that is mostly due to the bar tender's cheery demeanor. 
I had business to do in Scottsdale and needed food plus an afternoon Cubs game. 1 out of 2 will do I guess. I am not blaming your establishment for the rain delay. I will simply compliment you on providing a very friendly first time experience that will bring me back soon looking to add that 5th star."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet! Great food and drinks! Great location = next to Scottsdale Gun Club and quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Review for Brunch

The build your own Bloody Mary is a decent value for $5. Be aware that it's not a build your own Bloody Mary BAR but a checklist that you can select ingredients. $1.50 for a small piece of bacon is too much.

Service on patio is VERY slow.

Brunch prices are HIGH. $13 for a skillet breakfast."}
{"text":"Circle night at KO's with awesome wings, potato skins, and tater tots.  Food was awesome and service second to none!  The champ tonight won us $185 on 3 exacta horse races so dinner was on the House.  Not bad for a Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Real life Cheers bar with some of the best bartenders in the valley! Thanks Laura and Kristy for always providing great service."}
{"text":"Love!! Great food, and one of the few places in Phoenix that have a dog friendly patio!!"}
{"text":"I felt the need to update my 1st post about KOs. Like I said before I eat there a lot and I like it a lot, so to have given it 3 stars based on 1 bad trip out of many is not fair. 

I feel that too many people on Yelp do what I have done. People are creatures of habit and eat at the same place a lot. No body remembers the positive things, and are too fast to comment about a bad experience. 

KOs is A OK in my book. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here to eat before, but not in some time.  I swung by here after the horse show on Saturday with John C as we were starving, and he had wanted an alcoholic beverage. I figured it was time to stop in and eat here since its been a while for me.

This place has a decent menu, with a variety of menu items and a full bar of drinks to choose from.  We were in here on a Saturday around 5ish, and there was hardly anyone in the place...just a family sitting kitty corner to us, and maybe one or two partons in the bar.  Kinda dead for a Saturday, in my opinion.

Service here was good, and John C had a bloody mary and some quesadias. I went with the sliders appitizer, and we both went with sweet potato fries.  Alcohol prices were reasonable, but the place was darn near empty.

Anyways, I got my K O'donnells fix for now, and Im glad I went.  Left feeling full, and had some tasty sweet potato fries in the mean time!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night on a recommendation, and it was dead. We sat on the patio and had some food, which is definitely better than standard bar fare but not amazing. The waitress looked like she couldn't wait to go home. Beer selection didn't wow me either."}
{"text":"I had a great dining experience the other evening.  The food, service and the outdoor ambiance was outstanding; although their indoor restaurant is also very inviting , as well.  This is a neighborhood gem. Don't think that this is your typical \"bar & grill\"...the food is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast menu with $5 build-you-own bloody marys. Nice staff, lots of TVs."}
{"text":"Big, suburban, sports bar. Vey average bar food at average prices. About 20 TV's. You know the place. Sounds like a total 2 star rating to you?  Me too. 
But really cheap drink prices earns a third."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
We arrived about 5:30 PM yesterday and sat at the bar. Laura was the bartender - she was great! Drink special- Stoili's Vodka was $4. I had a vodka tonic. My husband had a few snake bites : Talls for the happy hour price.
Menu is full of so many amazing options! Also received a Saturday Night special flier with some unique offerings as well.
Started with the WINGS ( those are our thing) LOL.They're really good. Fried then grilled. Many flavors to choose. We went with the KO & Sweet/ Hot. Suggest that if you like them saucy, have them re-tossed after their Grilled. We had to ask for extra sauce on the side to dip them in. It's served with Blue cheese ( scrumptious) & or ranch: we had both. Presentation is spot on! 
My husband went with the Rancher Burger requested an eggs (over easy) on top! It's probably the most Gigantic burger he's had thus far in Arizona. He requested it medium and it was cooked to perfection! Got a side of BBQ sauce which is made in house. It's warm & smoky- really delish..you have the choice of a side. How cool that you can do half tots and half fries. What a fantastic thing!! LOL
I had the Fu Get About It Pizza. So many tasty toppings. YUM! The dough has a nice flavor. I opt'ed for the small. It's a perfect size for two! I could only eat a two slices. 
Portions Sizes are well worth the cost. We had plenty to take home! 
The atmosphere is super relaxing! We sat indoors. However, the outside patio was pleasant- there are misters, televisions & you can even bring the doggies!
We had such a nice time here. Great food, great experience & a pleasure to be served by Laura . Every accommodation met!! 5 Stars for that!!  We will be back again! If you haven't been here you'll have to come experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"1 star- why? The food wasn't too bad. My husband had the fish tacos which were good. I ordered the Sicilian Stuffed Chicken, but get this... it's not even stuffed. I had food envy.

Anyway, the waitress was super busy and I had to wave her down everytime I needed something. We went there tonight after Costco. Kid's eat free on Sundays. I've never even been there, so I didn't know. The waitress \"forgot\" to take the kid's meals off. It's advertised on the colorable menus. Then when I gave her my Groupon, she said she couldn't accept it. Now mind you, we ordered a couple of rounds of alcoholic drinks, so our bill wasn't low. And no where on the Groupon did it say that it couldn't be used with a special. A Groupon would normally state that.

After I am \"allowed\" to use my Groupon, I won't go back there again. We go out several times a week out to eat, and I'd rather spend my money somewhere else. The food was decent, but I definitely wouldn't rave about it. The waitress took almost 20 minutes to get our bill situated. My husband was annoyed that we were waiting for so long. The owner, who was very nice, had to close out our check and bring us a box. We never even saw the waitress again. Way to go!

Oh, and it was the same temperature inside as it was outside. I guess they're really doing that bad and can't turn on the air conditioner. My 2 year old was sweating for the first time."}
{"text":"One of our go to places for drinks with friends. Casual and laid back atmosphere. Service is always great, manager Dasha always stops and checks to make sure everything is good. Pizza is great, wings are amazing and their drinks are outstanding."}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place, for a sports bar it has really good food, although as a restuarant the food is overpriced for what you get.  The service is generally good. The beer selection is horrific for a bar with a lot of taps. Lots of beers like blue moon, coors light, guinness but really lacking anything with any real flavor. With all the many good beers available in Phoenix it sucks when you have a place that has so much potential but it just won't step up to the plate and offer good craft beer to go along with their food. One bonus is the free shuttle to your house. Desserts are not on the menu but are available and are delicious."}
{"text":"Honey hot wings are the bomb... salmon salad ... don't get... burnt.. too salty... over done.   Ordered a burger which is good... they took the salmon off bill ... which is a must . Very smokey outside even in the non smoking section ...

Only other grip... most places woukd have taken a percentage off or a free meal ... not looking for that... but would have been nice!!! 
Manager did say his apology..."}
{"text":"I love this place best pizza and chicken wings, Brunch is easy as Sunday morning....Bartendars are great but nothing beats Laura's stellar skills !"}
{"text":"Went to a Dream Dealers game at K O'Donnell's.

They had a special on Kilt Lifter, so I had plenty of those.

Ordered the chorizo and cheese dip, which was delicious, but should be served in a wider bowl.

Had potato skins as well, which were very good.

Not in my neighborhood, so I'm not likely to go very often, but I would return."}
{"text":"I came here very early morning at around 10am so I didn't run into any busy traffic with waiters, waiting for food or anything like that. Our waiter was very nice and helped me order since it was my first time being here. I ordered a pancake with bananas it was sweet n tasty, what I like about the pancakes here is that the ingredients (bananas, chocolate chips,etc) are actually baked in the pancakes they are not just tossed on top. Another great thing about the pancakes they are actually baked it makes a great difference they are sooo fluffy in the inside and on the outer side of the pancake crispy, yummy! I only ate half of the pancake. I also ordered there breakfast platter; 2 sunny side eggs were warm and tasty I ate only one , 2 sizzling sausages ate half of 1, and evenly cooked hash browns only ate a spoonful. Lastly I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy and omg they are the best I have ever tasted I highly recommend trying them out! They come with 2 biscuits I only ate one I so wanted to save the other one for later. I tried a little bit of everything I didn't finish everything and not because the food wasn't to die for but, because I did order a lot of food couldn't fit everything in my stomach. I guess I got carried away lol I so wanted to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"My quick summary-  Normal bar food taken to a whole 'nother level.

I rarely travel to this neighborhood in Scottsdale, but when I do, I always stop at KO's.  This is a nice, friendly neighborhood bar.  The owner is a nice guy, the staff is always friendly & courteous.  They have fun activities, like poker tournaments, on certain days.  They have TVs in every inch of the restaurant, so you never miss a game.  You can easily spend a couple hours here.

The menu is pretty amazing.  They have your basic bar food like potato skins, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  But, the manage to elevate their food to something surprising and unexpected.  Their chicken sandwich with pesto & cheese, so good & unexpected for a location like this.  Yet simple enough to make you wonder why other places can't manage good food like this.  I maintain their sweet potato fries are the best in the valley.  Their mac & cheese is worth the calories and cholesterol.

I ordered their grilled cheese one day, without tomatoes.  When it came, they forgot & added them by mistake.  Didn't bother me, I was willing to take them off.  But the waiter took it back, had them make me fresh one, and then took it off the bill.  All without me asking.

An excellent place to watch the big game or just pop in for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Good food and great service, I'm coming back. The wings were great and the green chile burger rocked!"}
{"text":"If this place weren't so far from my house, I'd probably be there a couple times a week. It was my first visit, but my \"Fu-Get-About-It\" pizza was great. And I just happened to be there on a night that it was half price! Good pizza and 50% off . . . nothing bad about that!

How about a location in Tempe? Or Mesa? Or Gilbert? 

They have lots of choices on the menu and lots of specials . . . so I am sure everyone could find a choice that would please them. One of my dining companions had a fairly large salad and, besides one small piece of chicken breast which she took home, she ate every last green leaf. My other dining companion had a French Dip with onion strings on the side. He too seemed to have no problem scarfing that scrumptious looking sandwich down . . . he didn't finish the onion strings; but I think that was because there was a 14' mountainous pile of them when they arrived at the table. I tasted them . . . no complaints. Wish they'd been on my plate . . . I might have finished them for him! 

My only disappointment of the evening was the seasonal fresh cobbler. Although tasty with a mound of vanilla ice cream on top, it was more like a bowl of very hot bubbling cinnamony coffee cake topping with melting ice cream. The \"fresh peaches\" were few and far between and, if I hadn't already been told, I'm not sure I would have known that it was supposed to be a fresh peach cobbler. I'll try something different that next time I want dessert."}
{"text":"KO's is a great sports bar. I enjoy the option of picking bar, dining, or patio space. Plenty of TVs for the game and great service. Chris was our server and he was on point with drink orders and making sure we were enjoying our time. We will continue to enjoy KO's - thank you Chris!"}
{"text":"We tried to go here for the some college football game that seemed to be a pretty big deal. It was too full and they were kind enough to tell us that it would probably be a REALLY long time to get a table. Appreciated the honesty. We left and decided to try again another day. 

That day came after a long hike. We were craving a cold crappy beer and they came through for us. They did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it's not all about crappy beer.  

We ordered the Apps special of green chili smothered fries (or tots) and they brought out the smothered fries from the menu. Whoops. Eventually our waitress came back and we asked about the other fry option. She apologized and took the fries back. The woman who actually brought the fries came over and apologized and said she would take care of it for us. They were all really nice about it which I think is a bonus. I hate sending things back but these were not the fries we ordered and the apps special fries were way better! So glad they took care of it and got the right ones out. Yum! 

That aside our firecracker chicken sandwich was tasty! I like having a variety for side options instead of just fries so we got the onion strings. 

Overall this place has the sports bar thing down. Nice patio, big bar, and solid menu. We'll certainly visit again since it's right down the street from our house. Also, love the free ride home option! More bars should do that!"}
{"text":"This review is for you Alexis! You were simply put, the best waitress I've ever had. You knocked the most expensive restaurants (service wise) out of the water. Of course the food was great, but just the way you were so genuine and easy going was a great pair to a great meal. I loved your accent too by the way ."}
{"text":"This is and forever will be my favorite place to get wings! You may think it is your everyday sports bar but it is FAR from that. They have the most delicious menu, from pizzas to signature burgers and salads to amazing wraps and sandwiches. Food and drink specials every day. The owners and managers Jen O'Donnell and Don Stremme are amazing. They have a badass patio with tons of TVs, perfect for game days or happy hour. Your puppy can even hang with you on the patio, they'll bring him/her a bowl of water too :) Oh, AND a brunch on the weekends that is BOMB. Trust me. If you've never tried it, stop what you're doing and get in there. You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"K O'Donnell's is the best sports bar in Arizona hands down.  The food is amazing and I love that they have so many healthy options.  On the weekends they do brunch and the King Cakes are to die for.  I love coming on Wednesdays for team trivia and they do poker 3 nights a week.  I usually sit on the patio so I can bring my dog.  They have a ton of misters and fans so you stay cool in the summer and there is no shortage of TV's to watch outside.  The staff is awesome and always makes me feel welcome. If you haven't tried this place you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Buckeyes game while we were in town. The grilled wings were good, the nachos were simple but pretty good, and they had good happy hour specials. We split a pizza and got 1/2 what my wife wanted, and 1/2 what I wanted and they ended up charging us $19.00 for a small because they had to charge full price for each topping even though it was only on half or a small pizza? Atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were looking for some wings and came across K O'Donnell's.  We have been a couple times now.  Their wings are great!  They have a smokey taste with light flavoring.  They are delicious.  My favorite were the honey hot!  We have also tried a few of their salads like the Cobb, which were packed with wonderful toppings.  We will continue to be back for more wings!"}
{"text":"We got here around midnight last Friday... the place was dead. However, they were still serving food and we enjoyed some well made pub grub. Service was friendly, quality cocktails were served, and the atmosphere is derived from an old Uno's, which certainly works for a sports bar. It being located in a somewhat commercial area, I can see why it's empty so late on a Friday. From what my friends tell me - this is a great spot for happy hour, and it stays relatively busy thru 10pm.

*UPDATE - Great patio for day-drinking on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Made it out on Saturday afternoon for a poker tournament. Hadn't seen a few folks for a while as I live on the other side of the world. Had the big burger, with string onions...Burger was great with some provolone added. More than filling, tried some Orange Stoli with 7up, that was also great. Wish I lived closer, I'd drop by more often. Lots of cute gals there too, including my server Valerie who took great care of me, even offered a sample of their bloddy mary mix."}
{"text":"Short version? Not a horrible place for lunch - their food is good - but their recent price increase and changes have pushed them over the edge of a place that's worth going to. There are better options.

My office is close, and i've been eating there on a fairly regular basis for about the last 4 years, but it's now officially out of my rotation for good. In addition to prices going up, they've also changed their available items you can get as a side with things like sandwiches and burgers. Used to be you could get a small side salad in exchange for fries, if you wanted a healthy option. Not any more. (still have a couple other options - cottage cheese, for example.) And i would generally be okay with this change, if they would give you fair warning. Instead of notifying me that the salad i asked for would be extra, they just charged me $3.99, which seems a bit much for a side salad. In addition, they didn't bring the fries (or ask what side i actually wanted) that were suppose to come with the turkey burger. Overcharged and shorted a side item - nice! 

Like i said, the actual food is good, which counts for something i suppose, but it's not good enough. Not enough to pay $18 (after tip) for a side salad, turkey burger, and glass of water. No thanks."}
{"text":"They have the best wings in town make sure to try the special wings with their own creation of a sauce. The Wings come with a nice char grill mark on them. Everything else has been good to including the salads. Sometimes the TVs are too loud and the people get too excited over the games so be prepared for the noise. But hey it's a sports bar so you know what you're getting. Our service has always been good. They have poker games going on a couple times a week for gift card prizes"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times, and have always received exceptional service, and the food/drinks are tip top.  They also have enough plenty of TV's to watch any game you'd want, and my favorite beers are on tap.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"So I eat at KO's like 2 or 3 times a week for lunch. But a guy has got to mix it up occasionally and get outside the box.  So twice this week I ventured off to other places in the Airpark for lunch.  What does this have to do with KO's you might wonder? Well it reminded me of what makes a great restaurant.  All of the restaurants in the airpark are busy at lunch time. What makes Kevin and Jim do such a good job is that they have enough staff on duty to handle the amount of customers they have. They are adequately staffed.  Twice this week when I was cheating on KO's I had to wait and wait for my check to arrive.  I never have that problem at KO's. Also my drink never gets below half empty before they top me off.  I can't eat at KO's every single day of the week. I try, but on the days I don't I always regret it."}
{"text":"This place has more than pizza and nachos...Great food prepared lightning fast. You will love the wings and wraps."}
{"text":"I love KOs !  Patio dIning is the best,  Fire Pit , flat screens and misters. Great selection of beers and excellent nachos.  Friendly Service and Very Relaxing place to chill out.  The view is lacking to streets or parking lot, so just enjoy the company you are with."}
{"text":"K O'Donnells is definitely the place to be! When it comes to food, this place has everything! You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Not only do they have the stellar food, they have an award winning doggy patio! I bring my dog very frequently to socialize with other dogs. If your looking for a stellar happy hour come in from 3-7 and get some food and ice cold beers! You can't go wrong with the daily specials and those speciality martini's!"}
{"text":"Grilled wings! They're awesome. This is a good place for HH specials / to meet up with coworkers or friends."}
{"text":"Friendly service , good food that came
Out very fast during a crowded lunch . Tons of Tv s to watch your favorite team . We will be back."}
{"text":"KO's is the best! Craft beers? Check! Delicious in-house food? Check! Big screen TVs? Check! This place is a great high-end sports bars. I highly recommend coming here for football Sundays. The staff is always so friendly and the management team is always willing to go the extra mile for it's patrons."}
{"text":"While staying in Scottsdale for business, my coworker and I were looking for a local spot to grab some dinner and drinks. Our hotel shuttle driver recommended stopping at k'o for taco Tuesday. I love me some tacos. We started with the fried ravioli and potato skins for our appetizers with a couple of Moscow mules. The appetizers were great! However, the drinks were super weak! Moving on, we decided to get pork tacos as they were recommended as the most popular taco choice. Lemme just say the sounded much better than they tasted. We both thought the tacos were extremely dry and small. I ended up using a massive amount of sour cream to choke them down. We were still hungry and moved onto the house wings. The wings were legitimately pink on the inside and I lost the rest of my appetite. The service and apps are what earned the stars in this review. Needless to say we will not be stopping here again on our trip."}
{"text":"One of the best options for really good bar food in North Scottsdale.

We had salad, potato skins, wings and Mac and cheese!

This is now our go to place for bar food in the area!"}
{"text":"We were craving wings and found this spot on Yelp. The wings were GREAT! We ordered a round as appetizers and then decided to order more and make a dinner out of them!! So so good! I recommend the KO's Secret Sauce (like buffalo with blue cheese added!) and the Hot Honey.

We each ordered a small salad (so we could claim the dinner was healthy!). Husband had a wedge and liked it. I had a Bitmore (BILTMORE SALAD
Romaine, roasted chicken, corn, bacon, diced tomatoes, bleu cheese crumbles and green onions tossed in our mustard vinaigrette.) the chicken in the salad was weird and rubbery, so I just ate around it. The dressing was really good though!

We went there so we could watch a basketball game. They were super nice and changed channel on the closest TV for us. 

Not a very good draft beer selection. Only a couple of craft drafts. Lots of bottles, though.

They have trivia night (not our thing, so we didn't stay long), and it was busy but not frenetic.

Highly recommend this place to watch sports and eat wings!"}
{"text":"Best sports bar in Scottsdale by far! I've had probably 10 different items on the menu and they all were above expectation! Great service also! The outside patio is great anytime of the year and has numerous TVs outside so you don't miss a second of your favorite game even on the patio"}
{"text":"Nice casual pub style place to grab lunch, I imagine it is a pretty busy bar at night. They claim to have great wings so I ordered some and the flavor was great, but even though I ordered them well done they were still raw in the center. Kinda ruined lunch. Overall the service was good, lots of people coming by to see if everything was ok. I'd come back here for a beer or a sandwich sometime, but not for wings again."}
{"text":"Most amazing customer service....they really know how to treat their customers and make them feel like true guests. What I am about to share is a true story of one of the most genuine and warmest hospitality experiences....first and foremost, this was my first experience visiting K O'Donnell's today after a suggestion from a friend....

I looked it up on Yelp to check the reviews and the menu...and zeroed it on an item that made my mouth water...it was called The Firecracker Chicken Sandwich, and called for all kinds of goodies including homemade guacamole etcc...

By the time I got to the restaurant, I did not see the same item on the menu much to my dismay...I asked the manager about it...and he mentioned that it could perhaps have been on an old menu and that Yelp had not taken it off after repeated attempts by the restaurant to do so...

Nevertheless, I told them I had seen it online and offered to show the sanwich's description on my phone to which they said No problem...we'll make it...

What was served to me was a true juicy masterpiece of perfection and probably by far the very best chicken sandwich I have ever had and both the manager and chef treated me with utmost care and kindness with wanting nothing more but my happiness.

I disagree with some other reviews that the food is average or just okay. The food was awesome, the service superb and that review comes from someone who  doesn't care much about sports bars...well done! Five stars all the way..."}
{"text":"Great place for great wings!!  Service awesome both times we have been. 
Clean friendly & we are looking forward to trying more on the menu. Our new favorite place"}
{"text":"Great place -- especially for a large group.

We were a group of 50 kids and adults -- a soccer team visiting town for a soccer tournament at nearby Scottsdale Sports Park.  KO's was great at setting up a room for us, keeping the food and drink flowing, and setting up the tvs to watch a rotating series of championship week basketball games from the ACC to the PAC12.

The food was very good - from wings and pizza to bbq and grilled salmon, adults and kids were all happy. The beer selection and bar is excellent. And the staff was very friendly, professional, and helpful...no small feat for such a large group.

Would definitely go back -- big group or small.  It's a nice place for a good bar meal and and excellent place to watch a game.

They have a really nice patio with TVs and fireplaces if the desert cools down for you."}

{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite, fantastic bacon burger and great service having a nice lunch with my family, then Hank walked in. He started yelling \"KO!  KO!  KO!  I'm getting knock out drunk.\"  He ordered one of every shot and did all of them in 5 minutes and passed out on the floor. Everyone had to step over the drunk ass. I recommend KO's I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch your favorite sports teams. Lots of TVs that are showing various games. They have the sound boxes that sit on your table too so you can have your game's audio! Friendly and good service. We tried the wings - awesome! The KO way is delicious! Good neighborhood spot or just a low key spot to enjoy yourselves. I'd be a regular if it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere.  Best place to watch football on the weekends!  Grilled wings are great and finish off your meal with a cookie skillet!"}

{"text":"I went here for my first time since I'm visiting from NY to watch Penn State in the Fiesta bowl. I have to say this may be my new favorite restaurant of all time. The service was fast and exceptional. The food was amazing. I don't even know what was my favorite and we got about 25 different dishes to share (group of 9, there for 3 hours). Their app choices are all very good. Prices are very reasonable. Chris our waiter was quick and was there whenever we needed him. Plenty of TVs and sounds boxes for the table, which I like so I can listen to what I am watching. I would recommend this place to anyone. I will definitely be going back the next time PSU is in the Fiesta bowl. We are!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter was starving and some great college football matchups were coming on so I asked her to find a sports bar in Scottsdale with good food. One look at the KO McDonnell menu and we were on our way to try it out. Immediately they sat us at a booth where we could watch the game I selected, with other tvs nearby so I could glance at other games.
My \"Build your own burger\" char broiled and with onion rings was the best I've had so far in town. Barby was also happy with her buffalo crispy chicken sandwich with onion straws. My beer was cold and tasty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Waited far too long for a simple drink order (sodas and waters). Manager couldn't care less when we raised the issue. Food (when it came) tasted like it had been under a heat lamp. 

Do not recommend. Would have had a better dining experience at a McDonalds. At least there I expect food to sit."}
{"text":"Candice is an excellent server, she made sure our drinks were refilled and the food to our liking (it was). The on duty mgr stopped to make sure of the same, the pork and the ultimate sandwiches were flavorfu and very large portions. We will be back!

{"text":"For the record: I'm just not that into salmonella. 

We hit this place on a Wed after work for some snacks and a beer. We needed a fun place to go to fairly quickly because we have a little one that hits the sack early. 

It was still happy hour -it goes until 7, so that goes in the plus column, so we ordered quesadillas ($4 on hh menu) and a cobb salad to share. The quesadillas were really only worth about $4- two of the pieces had nothing but cheese in them. The two pieces in the middle had some tomatoes, green onions and black beans. Definitely not worth the more than $4 they normally are. 

Then, our salad showed up with chicken that was completely raw in the middle. All the way through every slice- RAW, PINK, JELLY. We sent it back and the server was pretty apologetic. 

When it arrived, the manager brought it and literally all he was was, \"Sorry,\" and dropped it off at the table. Maybe I'm a snob, but if I had almost made an entire family  seriously ill, I would have offered to pay for the salad. 

We will probably skip this place and just hit Four Peaks from here on out."}
{"text":"Love this family friendly restaurant & bar. Love there happy hour there appetizers are wonderful, best of all they deliver during the day for lunch, it's the best delivery  so my staff and I indulge in awesome lunches a couple of times a month. Would recommend KO's to every one"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my visit at happy hour after a visit to the adjacent gun club, and overall I was pleased but wish there were a few changes.  I appreciated that they had several craft beer options on draft, and service was good once I was acknowledged at the bar.  Mozz sticks were ok, not fully melted inside, and that leads to my concerns.  They limit the happy hour to only specific appetizers, which excludes the mozz sticks.  I love hitting happy hours, and there's nothing more frustrating than having that first beer in front of you and then being told the appetizer you're specifically craving is excluded."}
{"text":"This place was amazing for watching football on a Sunday afternoon! Before we even walked inside you can see the outdoor patio has a ton of TVs and they make sure that every football game is being played live. Then we walked inside and BAM sooo many more TVs to enjoy our Sunday football games! Our waitress was very engaging and attentive to our needs the entire time we were there! Another cool thing this place has are these optional portable speakers that can connect directly to the game of your choice so that you can listen and watch the game that you want to watch, super cool in my opinion and I think more sports bars should have this option because it was great! The food was awesome as well and the beers were great priced! Overall awesome Sunday football experience at K O'Donnell's Sports Bar & Grill! Will totally come back again and would highly recommend! 10/10"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this sports bar. All the reviews are pretty positive. I am reviewing for my first visit because, to be honest, I'm not sure we will go back and we were hoping to utilize this bar as our game watching location for football and hockey. It's a great size, close to home, and has a great looking food and special drinks menu and decent taps for the beer boys. I was out doing errands and stopped in for a late lunch. I sat at the bar. I ordered the wings because I am a wing fiend and these sounded interesting and tasty. They first fry the wings like normal, then sauce them, and then grill them. I LOVE spicy foods, so I ordered volcano. The wings arrived with bleu cheese, carrots and celery. Some of them were maybe a little overdone, but not enough to complain about and as you will see below, I don't think that would have been a good idea. The wings were very good, but definitely not spicy. Not even a little bit. I asked the bartender for a side of the volcano sauce to dip them in and that helped. 
So, the food was good. Not fantastic as many others have experienced, but good. So, why three stars instead of four? The atmosphere in the bar was just...off. Granted, it was 2:30ish on a Thursday, before happy hour, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. There were regulars and staff and they were definitely taking advantage of the slow time. I didn't get a friendly vibe from most of them and they pretty much stuck to themselves. It wasn't nasty or anything, just \"off\". I just had wings and no drinks, so maybe that was the problem. When I asked for the sauce after receiving the wings, I felt like I was interupting. I've been a server and a bartender and my FAVORITE part was getting to visit and build a rapport with all my patrons, newbies and familiar faces. After all, that's how you get regulars! If we go back as a group to watch a game, eat, and order drinks, I'll let you all know. :/"}
{"text":"This place was perfect for lunch, but took a bit longer than expected. It was busy and when the food came we figured out why. The fries....WHOA. Delish! My co-workers got pizza and had great things to say about it. This would be a place I would love to do happy hour some time after work. It's a very laid back environment with lots of TV's, beer and yummy food - win!"}
{"text":"I truly hated giving them a bad review but one way to quickly get me to change my review is a reply from a manager!! That shows me that you care about my experience and not my money!!

Thank you Jennifer for getting back to me and we will of course be back to KO's soon!!"}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch.  The turkey burger and sweet potato fries are the best! The staff is superb, especially Ian, Don and Derek. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  Great food.  Accept reservations.  Live music.  I don't have a single complaint.  I wish there were more like K O'Donnell's. Made reservation for 12.  9 showed up. We felt terrible.  Wait staff was beyond kind and we tipped them generously.  We'll return. Great experience."}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. The Mac and cheese was so good!! I'll definitely be back again next time I'm in town."}
