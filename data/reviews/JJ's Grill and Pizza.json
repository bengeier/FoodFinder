{"text":"All I have to say about this place is that the service was terrible, we waited 30 minutes before anyone approached our table, entertainment was awesome, took my drink away before it was finished, I asked the bartender to please give me a water (after standing at the bar for 5 minutes)....she replied I was f......... rude and to ask my waitress for a water.....not returning!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is literally one of the worst pizza places I have ever ate at. They gave my family and I hot wings that were completely raw and carrots that had mold all over it. The only thing that was practically worth buying was the soda! I do not recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"doesn't even deserve the 1 star. pizza had no flavor. my kids love pizza and they didn't even finish one slice. ended up giving it to a homeless guy more than half of the pizza. who even knows if he ate it. I didn't even want to give him the raw wings because I didn't want him to get sick. i would not recommend this place even to someone I hate.... !!!! it's only been open like three weeks from what they said. by what they serve I don't see it being open long term. all these people giving this place 4 stars must be friends of the owners or relatives giving out false information...."}
{"text":"Large space just opened. The pizza is bland tastes like straight tomato sauce. I do like the pizza crust though.  Pizza would be be good if they put some effort in the taste. I did see another family that looked like they purchased everything on the menu and it looked great. Hopefully they enjoyed their food. Not too sure if I would go back. I will have to see some good reviews in order to do so. I wish I would have went over to the King Eggroll that day.  I just wanted to see what JJ's grill and Pizza was all about. I would hate to see it close. But they need to step up on their game and make it happen if they want to be successful. I passed by yesterday and it was looked a little dead to me."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and had pizza...... It was delicious! Crust was awesome, fresh ingredients! Very friendly staff.....can't wait to go back and try other menu items.  Love having a good clean place to grab lunch or dinner! Try it.... You will not be disappointed! They will be serving alcohol soon.....it'll be. Great place to catch a game too!"}
