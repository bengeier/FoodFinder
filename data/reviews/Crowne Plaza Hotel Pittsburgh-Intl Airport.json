{"text":"Do you like old, moldy, dirty, smelly, outdated rooms?  If so the Crowne Plaza is for you!  As I have stated in past reviews, the majority of Crowne Plaza's are former failed properties.  No different with this location.  From the moment you walk in the door you get a feeling of 1985.  Immediately upon arrival I asked for a room change due to all the hair and ink covering the mattress.  As someone else has stated the air condition units are probably 40 years old.  I actually had to twist a round metal dial to turn up the radiator.    After getting my new room I could finally relax watching my 1994 31 inch Sharp television!  11 channels to choose from!   The only saving grace for this place was van drivers.  We were stuck here for a few days and they took great care of us.  Anywhere we wanted to go they made happen.    Don't sentence yourself to this place.  Pay the extra 50 bucks somewhere else.  There is a reason this place is cheaper."}
{"text":"This place was a dump!  70s wallpaper peeling from the walls, old school bathroom, heating/cooling system not working and dated furniture.  Save your money and go to another hotel in the area!"}
{"text":"New management...saggy beds and the person I was traveling with had to kill a cockroach in his room. There's nothing nearby and its a long shuttle ride to PIT."}
{"text":"The rooms are clean but in need of a little updating (old phone, old cd player alarm clock, old loud a/c etc). I called down for room service and the phone literally rang for 5 minutes. When I called the Front Desk to see what the problem was I was told they were busy. I then went downstairs to order my food and found the restaurant practically empty. Kind of annoying. Overall I wasn't impressed and I certainly wouldn't recommend staying here."}
{"text":"This hotel is a disgrace to Crowne Plaza. The hotel is literally falling apart and needs renovations. The rooms are stuffy and there is no central air system so you have to listen to the a/c unit cycle on and off all night. The shower was broken and I could hardly splash water on myself. The room was only moderately clean as well. I only give the extra star for the friendly service and decent food at the bar."}
{"text":"*** AVOID AVOID AVOID ***  Dump. Saggy beds. Worn carpet. Air conditioner in my room sounded like an outboard motor on a John-boat. I had to wear ear plugs to get some sleep. Long van ride from the airport. Pass on this place.   *** AVOID AVOID AVOID ***"}
{"text":"The decor is dated, but they give free wi-fi and a free breakfast ticket.  Interestingly, they did not give my boss a free breakfast ticket.  I was able to talk the front desk into giving her one, too, but why the different treatment?  They advertise that food is available 24/7 via room service, but it's not true.  When there in May, the kitchen closed at 10pm and the staff seemed shocked when this was brought up.  The front desk person assured me over the phone the week before that they had 24 hr room service.  I was actually checking on behalf of my boss who was flying in from the west coast, so you can imagine that she was hungry by the time she arrived after 10pm Eastern.  The location is close to the airport, which is nice.  I prefer the Embassy Suites a couple of miles away.  It's actually closer to the airport and the  breakfast is free for all (plus a better selection)."}
{"text":"This is a dated hotel with not much going for it.    My room was clean.   My bathroom was somewhat clean but there were drainage problems with the tub and some discoloration of the caulking around the tub.  I will probably stay there again because it was $50 cheaper per night than most of the competitors.  I did not eat there nor did I really spend too much time at the location.     I missed my Holiday Inn Express if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"Having stayed at both places, the Courtyard is nicer. It was not awful, but if possible, I'd try to stay up around the Robinson Mall area."}
{"text":"Something must have changed since these other reviews were written, or else the others here are very high maintenance. Yes, some updates are needed and there was a notice in the lobby which pointed that was coming in June 2013. However, we had good wings and salad in the bar, wonderful and friendly service, HDTV with plenty of channels, re-tooled bathroom, old wall unit climate control, and older bed. For what it is, I submit this hotel was nice. It's all relative, you know? Listen, if you want top-notch in the 'Burgh you'll need to stay downtown and drop $300 per night. Got it? Everything was clean, everything worked, staff was knowledgeable and did their jobs, amenities WERE representative of a blue-collar old town 3/5 star airport area sleepery...I was pleased for the $140 out the door price (Monday night with a Steeler game in town). 4 stars on Yelp all the way! Give this place a try and then for sure we'll all be impressed come June '13."}
{"text":"I was told that they are remodeling the hotel by the shuttle driver.    Wish I had known that before I made a reservation through our company travel website.  I am sure it will be nice after the upgrades, but for now it is not a hotel I would stay at again.    By the way, it is a long way from the airport, however they do have a shuttle and it was easy enough, no long wait or anything.    I asked the person at the front desk if I could have a room that was better than average and that I had read the reviews regarding this hotel.  She put me in a room across from the elevators, and it was not a nice room.  Everything is sort of dirty and beat up.  Should have checked here before I made the reservation."}
{"text":"It's a Crowne Plaza so set your expectations appropriately. I'll give them this...the shuttle guys will take you anywhere if you ask. It's got a bar. The walls are thin.   It's the kind of place you stay when you have a meeting at a very close by business and didn't rent a car. About 10 minutes from the airport."}
{"text":"First off the staff makes the place...  It's dated. The HVAC units look like they're from the Ford Administration, the rooms don't have HDTV's and the wallpaper harkens back to the disco era... Get over it.  The staff are simply the most genuine, most helpful and most caring staff of any hotel i've been to... of over 500 hotels in 80 countries worldwide.   The restaurant is pretty decent and the bar well equipped... Also the breakfast is great!"}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel as part of a wedding block.   Our room was clean and cool. Every staff member from the front desk clerk to the housekeeping staff to the waitress in the restauarant were ridiculously polite and friendly. It was appreciated.   It was easy to get there, check in and check out.   The rooms were a bit dated, but I wasn't expecting four star accomdations. My only complaint was that our room felt a little damp. Otherwise, it was was a decent hotel at a good price."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful, and the service was great.  I especially liked the aromatherapy package that was in the room. It contained a foot and hand treatment and some body spritz.  The templespa company which made the products owes a debt to the hotel for advertising the products. I am a fan.  The hotel is under renovation, and at the moment is a little out of date. In no time, it will be fixed out, and you will love the setting as much as I loved the service. There is a gym which carries yummy apples and is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Oh how I love being awaken to the elevator door opening and closing. Unless you're are one of those who needs to constantly have noise going on request a room away from the elevator.   It's music to my ears being able to hear my neighbor going to the bathroom. Never realized how thin the walls can be in a hotel. Wow bathroom looks like it came straight out from the late 80s or early 90s. Are we cheapening out on the remodeling or is this Pittsburgh style?"}
{"text":"We used this hotel for my sister's wedding and it was a terrible experience.  Reserving the rooms was a confusing and frustrating process, and the sales department/guest relations department provided us with false information and did nothing to recitfy it after the fact. It was the worst customer service experience I've ever had at a hotel, and I would never go back!"}
