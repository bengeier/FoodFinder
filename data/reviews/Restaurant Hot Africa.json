{"text":"Food was a bit pricey. The fish was recommended, but not flavorful like I'd imagine. We also tried to goat with plaintain. It was average."}
{"text":"This is a really great place: friendly and straightforward. I would recommend the fish, which was crispy outside and tender within, glazed with a green pepper sauce and possessing a slightly smoked aroma. Rice was also very good, cooked with a red pepper, and the plantains were sweet and plump, not too greasy. I asked for some hot sauce, and the waitress brought me some piquant green salsa that was very delicious. It is BYOB as well. There is a bit of a ventilation issue, so bring your inhaler if you're an asthmatic, but overall I found the place enjoyable and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pricey ($15 per take-out for most meats), but good authentic flavours and genuine portion.

I don't usually get takeout next to home, but after countless times seeing African-Canadian people walk out of Hot Africa with takeouts, I decided to give it a try with the roasted lamb with fried plantain for $15. The lamb was flavourful (not salty) and fall-off-the-bone tender. I liked the fried plantains, they're a little sweeter than sweet potatoes, but a full portion was a little more than enough - I now take take half rice. On a second visit, I had the chance to try the \"bar brais√©\" which I understand to be braised seabass. It's a whole fish, fried and grilled as pictured on the menu. It had the same green sauce seasoning as the grilled chicken. Neither of them were as flavourful as the lamb but decent.

Do call a half-hour in advance so you can pick up and go. And oh, do ask for the \"piment\". It goes well with fried plantain. Cash only."}
{"text":"About 15$ per meal, but the portion is enough to fill any starving man from 0 to 100%.

It's generally a good idea to order 20-30min in advance, because that's the time it takes to get food out of the kitchen.

I had the half chicken, with fried plantain and rice. The half chicken was rather tender and juicy, a little burnt however. The marinate was peppery and very tasty, but they use the same marinate for every dish (my friend had seabass and it tasted same). 

The fried plantain were bland, but it's a good substitute for fries. To add flavor, I ate it with their hot sauce.

As for the rice, it was orange/pink-ish and somewhat aromatic, I don't know enough about african cuisine to tell what they added.

After the meal, I asked around and people said you can get similar food at cheaper prices around St-Michel."}
