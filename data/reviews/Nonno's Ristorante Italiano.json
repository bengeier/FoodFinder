{"text":"Nonno's is a fabulous restaurant.  It has everything you would want in a nice restaurant; beautiful ambiance, excellent and friendly waitstaff, delicious food, nice sized portions and reasonable prices.

We have eaten at Nonno's many times and it is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. They graciously remember us whenever we come in for dinner.
The garden salad is inexpensive and comes with healthy greens, cucumbers, carrots and tomatoes.  The bread is yummy too.

There is an extensive and creative selection on the menu, and everything we have eaten is out of this world.  To name a few: farfalle rustico, veal parmigiano, chicken marsala.

The owner is a very special and lovely person.

I highly recommend this restaurant with 5+ stars.

{"text":"Had a 3-course lunch there today during Madison's restaurant week.  Food was very good, but it appears to be run by the same previous owners when it was a Mexican restaurant.  Not too much Italian decor.

Food was excellent though...  Started with house bread basket.  Typical bread... Ceasar salad was fresh and lightly seasoned, main plate of a salmon pasta was nice and salty with a light creamy sauce.  Good portion size for lunch too...  Dessert was two large scoops of Spumoni... too much to end lunch with.

Other than having clam chowder soup on the menu.. (Italian?)... very good food and all guests (4 of us) enjoyed!  Will go back to try a few more authentic dishes!"}
{"text":"I tried Nonno's for the first time tonight. I'm giving it five stars because the service was great and my Pizza Alla Siciliana was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try the pasta."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Italian on the west side of Madison and don't want to go to a chain, this is your place.

The atmosphere is odd due to the decore, but the food and service more than make up for it.  The Risotto a Terra was flavorful and well balanced.  My partner had Farfalle with Sausage and enjoyed it as well.  There is a very large menu and we are excited to go back and try the rest."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - fabulous Italian food. After making a reservation at another italian place in town that was called \"worse than OG,\" we cancelled and made a reservation HERE at Nonno's. The service was great, except for one waiter who wanted to get into political debate at the end of the meal :)

I highly recommend the risotto, and our large family group loved every dish we tried! Great creme brulee too.


Thanks Nonno's!"}
{"text":"We  were only customer at that evening! The lady who took care of us was nice and gave a good recomendation. My husband liked it. Mine was not that good. So ask first!"}
{"text":"When Olive Garden feels a little too authentic"}
{"text":"I ate at Nonno's, or \"no! no!\" as we now refer to it and it was just okay.  I don't get the rave reviews.  Two of our dishes were decent and two were not good.    The pesto sauce on one of our dishes seriously tasted like it was made with dried basil."}
{"text":"Seriously loved this place. (\"Love\", actually, since I'm still here. Great food, gluten free options, very friendly. Hope they can make a go of it. The house salad had a wonderful variety of flavorful, fresh greens. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and the Penne Genovese were great."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here last night for an impromptu dinner out. I had read mixed reviews but the menu looked good, so we decided to try it. We arrived at the restaurant around 7:15, and were seated immediately. Only about 1/4 of the tables were filled. The atmosphere is cozy and Italy-like. I wouldn't have known this formerly served as a Mexican restaurant if other reviewers hadn't mentioned it! 
We were immediately given warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread was ok, but the oil/vinegar tasted someone \"off.\" Somewhat bitter. My husband and I both ordered their house salad (Insalata Della Casa) first. They were delicious! A pile of fresh, assorted greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and shaved carrots was mixed with their house Italian dressing. We were both pleasantly surprised at the $4 price tag for a pretty generous salad. Nonno's has such an extensive menu that deciding on an order took some time. Being a vegetarian, I typically find 3 or 4 dishes to choose from. Here, there were at least 10 dishes I could have ordered. I eventually decided on the Pasta Integrale (whole wheat pasta, wild mushrooms, spinach, red wine tomatoe sauce) for $13. My husband ordered the cheese Ravioli, which was served in a vodka tomato sauce, also $13. The portion sizes were HUGE. We easily could have split my dish. My husband's Ravioli was superb! My dish was ok, but not great. It tasted a bit \"gritty,\" as though all of the mushroom dirt hadn't been cleaned off. Or maybe the mushrooms were just wilder than I'm used to. 

Our waiter was quite nice, very talkative, and offered suggestions. 

Overall all, I will eat here again, but will not order the Pasta Integrale. I hope to try their desserts!"}
{"text":"Excellent night again at Nonno's.  Once again very attentive service from server Alex.  I've been there just 3 times now but great every time.  I was impressed that Alex remembered the wine I liked considering I've only been there a couple of times.  Alex was our sever also so he's good at multi-tasking as well.  Owner Juan was there as always, when one owns a family business one works long hours I'm sure.  Complementary bread and oil was served at the bar to nosh on with our wine.  A little balsamic along w/a good flavored oil went well with the Pinot Gri and focaccia.
My bosses were in town and I knew from past experience that Juan would come through w/a great meal. Juan is a very friendly man. 
We split 2 salads easily enough for 4 people everything seemed fresh and dressed nicely not too heavy.
I had the Pollo Cannarella- a Chix breast picatta served over fettuccine in a lemon caper sauce with olives.  The flavor is outstanding just the right amount of tartness.  My girlfriend had the Risotto Mare E Terra.  Good seafood mixed with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes in a vodka sauce that is not too heavy.  She does not like very rich dishes and this was a perfect fit for her. Risotto was cooked perfectly she said.  Bosses had a farfalle rustico w/a olive oil mushroom, other veg, garlic, parm and white wine sauce.  He said pasta was cooked perfect also and liked the dish a lot.  The other had a Penne Genovese w/chix and a basil pesto sauce topped w/a special tomato sauce.  Everyone commented that their meals were great.  Bosses both emailed me this am and thanked me for picking a nice restaurant and commented how much they enjoyed the meal.  They're fr/Chicago so they have their pick of good Italian restaurants so a nice compliment I thought.  I appreciated the fact that they bought dinner!
This honestly is a great restaurant with very friendly, attentive staff, great food and a variety of table types from cozy booths up front to more romantic secluded tables in the back.  It's a must go see and try."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and really enjoyed our meal!  I got a penne pesto chicken dish, which was really tasty but a bit heavy. The bread to start out the meal was really delicious--nice and warm served with balsamic vinaigrette.  My husband got a dish with house-made sausage.  The sausage had a really nice consistency and great flavor.  To finish our meal, we shared the tiramisu.  It was a huge portion and so delicious!  Overall it was a nice meal, but it would have been nice if the dinners came with a salad."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch over the January restaurant week. Three out of our party of four chose to do the $15 Restaurant Week prix-fixe, for which the portions were absolutely enormous- some of the largest \"appetizer\" sized salads I've ever seen, fish fillets that were likely close to a full fish, and a minimum two-serving sized mound of pasta. Our fourth had a panini and fries, which were generously portioned as well. While all the food was fine, there was nothing that really stood out as exceptional (or exceptionally bad). Our service was very quick, with our drinks being replenished frequently and without interrupting the meal. Overall, a fine place to stop for a quick weekday lunch, but not necessarily a place I'd seek out for return visits."}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first due to mixed reviews and the fact that this restaurant is located in a strip mall, however, it is AMAZING!  The bread came out very warm and was delicious with the olive oil and balsamic.  The house salad and Ceasar sale were both great.  All four of our meals were raved about, large portions, and well seasoned.  For dessert, we split the Tiramisu and the Cannoli.  The cannoli may have been the best I ever had!  Servers were attentive, but not overbearing.  If you are looking for excellent Italian in Madison, definitely go here!"}
{"text":"Traveling for work and my daughter tagged along for dinner. Half price bottles of wine on Monday and Tuesday, so that was a hit from the start. Ordered the Calamari Fritti. Large portion good flavor. Both ordered pasta dishes and we're pleased with our choices. Large portions meant we both had lunch the next day. Would have tried dessert, but no room!  Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Been here lots of times and never disappointed. Most delicious Italian food in Madison. Nice cozy ambiance, easy parking, good drinks, delicious bread right away with oil/balsamic vinegar. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Recently enjoyed dinner here on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised.  We found the bread fairly tasty but dense.  Like some other reviewers here we thought the olive oil to be less than great and the balsamic to be an odd addition.

Once the appetizer arrived we knew we were in the right place.  Taste and portions of the appetizer and entrees were grand.  So forego the bread and you'll be in a better position to enjoy what counts.  

And enjoy it you will.  There is but one Italian restaurant as good or better and it is/was in Albany, NY."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. 

Yeah, the ambiance is strange, it's not in any way a fancy restaurant. But the food is great. I've been here with groups and everyone liked what they got."}
{"text":"My family including grandma came here for a celebratory dinner and had a fabulous time. It was my grandma's birthday and the staff really went out of their way to make her feel special.

I had what I think was called Penne con Salmon and it was out of this freaking world. I daydreamed about it for days afterward and I know I will order it again.  It had lox and fresh salmon in it, and it was so perfectly creamy and well-spiced. My family members also enjoyed their dishes and the drinks were all fantastic. Our wait staff was wonderful - professional, non-intrusive, friendly, and quick. Plus one of them personally serenaded my grandma in Italian and she loved it!

I absolutely want to come again and hope to be known as the regular who always orders that salmon dish!"}
{"text":"Went with the calamari luciana (squid in spicy tomato broth) as an appetizer, the spaghetti polpette (spagetti and meatballs), the pappardele verdura (vegetable pappardele in a saffron cream sauce), and the tiramisu for desert. Bread and olive oil and garlic also come with the table.

Although not blown away, the food was ok and gave a nice alternative to an Olive Garden tier of italian food. Also, the staff was very pleasant.

So three stars seems a fair rating to me."}
{"text":"We love Nonno's. The Italian food is outstanding and the price is fair. Try the veal or chicken parmigiana or farfalle rustico. The glasses of wine are generous. The garden salad is excellent and the service is exemplary. The ambiance is nice too. We highly recommend this restaurant. Jerry and Merle S."}
{"text":"This place is a Noo No on my list. I will never go back..,,there are plenty of good places in Madison to try. 
To start: there was Mexican music playing which was off putting considering I was there for Italian 
Food. The bread appeared to have been pressed in a panini  grill and was pretty unimpressive. My dish featured the \"homemade\" sausage which was very tough and over cooked. The Tiramisu was flavorless and the wine was served in a glass that had dust all over the rim. For what you get.... The price of the food seems exorbitant.  I was confused about what the restaurant was about. There were tons of Mexican decorations and there were goldfish in a bowl at the hostess stand. 
There was a distinct smell in the Restaurant too..... It smelled like an old Bar.
My suggestion would be to improve the ambiance. Beef up the smells to make the place feel more Italian. Serve real fresh bread in a good quality Olive oil. Include at least a small side salad with an entree."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Italian place for several years. Took my beautiful wife there again last night for our anniversary and the food was as delicious and the atmosphere as charming as ever. I have had two of the best rib eye steaks of my life there. My wife loves the Chicken Marsala! Antonio is always there and treats us like old friends. Oh, and their Negroni is perfection!"}
{"text":"While the decor seems inappropriate for an Italian restaurant and it could use a little attention, the quality of the food and the attentive but non-intrusive service more than compensate. We loved the fresh bread. The house salad was generous, fresh and came with a light but flavorful vinegrette. Two of the special pasta dishes, a linguini with two kinds of mushrooms and bits of sausage in a delicate cream sauce, and the shrimp and cheese-filled ravioli in a fabulous red sauce, were exceptionally tasty. While we were comfortably full, we went for the cannoli which was good but a little sweet for my taste. We definitely will return"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I am gluten sensitive & I was happy to see that almost all of the pasta could be made gluten free. The service was great, too! We went on the Saturday of graduation & while they were busy, the server continued to check up on us & give us status updates on our food...he was extremely friendly & personable and made us feel like VIP guests. My husband & I both loved our pasta dishes $ drinks. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with a serious identity crisis. We came here at around 4:30 on a weekday and were greeted and seated promptly. Given that this is a new business and an odd time of day, we pretty much had the place to ourselves. It would have been nice and quiet if it weren't for the disruptive noise of a small child running around the bar/kitchen area for the first 30 minutes or so.

Although the atmosphere is warm and cozy, it's obvious that this location was formerly a Mexican restaurant (Cancun) and didn't give an Italian vibe at all. Spanish tiles and other Latin-inspired decor are still present, as are signs promoting Mexican beers. Staff members appeared to be of Hispanic descent and were heard speaking Spanish. The background music was also very odd and not appropriate for an Italian restaurant. Not only was it too loud, but the song styles were inconsistent and some were clearly Spanish/Mexican.

The service was very attentive and we promptly received bread with olive oil and balsamic. The bread was good but the oil had an off flavor and didn't taste authentic. Upon studying the menu, some of the selections seemed a bit unusual/non-traditional, as if improvised, with many of the more familiar entrees absent. Our dinners arrived in a reasonable amount of time but were only lukewarm. I ordered a pasta item and was disappointed with the small pieces of pancetta and prosciutto, although the portion size was good. It was also lacking flavor and intensity. However, my friend's salmon fillet-topped salad, was very good he said. We shared a tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts, but it too was lacking the rich texture and flavor I'm used to.

I'm not sure why this place is posing as an Italian restaurant when it's clearly destined to be Mexican. There are too many authentic Mediterranean-style restaurants in Madison to ever consider returning to this location. I think the proprietors should do what comes naturally instead of trying to reinvent themselves and be something they are not."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find this level of Italian food in Madison. Everything was very authentic, and a lot was made in-house. The staff was super friendly and accommodating, too."}
{"text":"I just ate the best meal I've eaten in a restaurant in a very, very long time. A little bit spendy, but worth every penny from perfect hunks of salmon floating in a tomato broth to the creamiest creme brûlée. 

Delicious."}
{"text":"Very good if you're craving Italian at a very reasonable price! I would say the average pasta dish was $14-18, cheaper than many Italian places. You also get a pretty large portion. Our server was very attentive and our food came out quickly. Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in when I was in town for the badger game. I had the Pasta Genovese -delicious! Everyone in my party really enjoyed their meal. I was confused about the roles the staff had...we had the bartender seat us. We didn't have a designated waiter, we weren't helped for about 10 minutes until a waiter came over and asked if we'd been helped - uhhhh no. We had one person bring the bread, another person pour the olive oil...by the end of our meal, every staff member had helped us with something. Over all, the food is the most important thing and it was great!"}
{"text":"The pasta dishes show some imagination and used tasty ingredients.  The fried Calamari was excellent.  The wait staff was very friendly and efficient.  The price for each dish was very reasonable.  Servings were ample."}
{"text":"Checked out Nonno's during restaurant week at lunch time. It was delicious from start to finish and the service was excellent! First, I must mention the bread they serve with the oil and vinegar is amazing! I usually try to avoid the bread basket at restaurants but I tried it and it was so good I ended up having TWO pieces! Yum! I had the ceasar salad, rigatoni pollo e funghi (chicken and mushroom rigatoni) and the cannoli. Even with lunch portions I couldn't finish it all and brought some home. The cannolis are made in house and the filling, well I could have ate a bucket full! No complaints. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place! Nonno's uses great ingredients, I never feel disgustingly full afterwards. It's very light and dangerously delicious! The wine is great and the staff is very warm! They remember you and are genuinely happy to see you! Go here instead of Olive Garden, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing pasta! My husband and I ordered two different pasta types and it was amazing! Unique recipes and homemade pasta. Looking forward to trying other menu items but would definitely come back for the pasta!"}
{"text":"We ate there last Saturday (group of four) and found everything delicious. We are going back again this Saturday.  We had four different dishes, including the lasagne, the pork medallions, and two different sea food dishes, all of which were great!  The bread was excellent as were the small Caesar side salads we had.

Overall we thought the prices were very reasonable.  The wine selection was extensive and included a lot of wines by the glass at reasonable prices.  The desserts looked great but we were all too full to try them!

As of this time, the do not yet have their website up so you can't look at their extensive menu.  They do take reservations and I am hoping that they will allow online reservations, but that remains to be seen."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was \"The Cancun.\" It's not hard. Not that much has changed in terms of the decor. 

There were so many appealing items on the menu that I was skeptical that the place could deliver on them. But may risotto was earthy and rich, and my husband's pasta was complex and full of seafood. Portion and prices seemed right on. 

Nanno's gets knocked down for ambience and service. The decor is \"off\" for an Italian place. (I I think they were playing Gloria Estefan overhead.) And our food came out quick, but otherwise service was quite slow even though there were very few people in the place."}
{"text":"This place has the best and most authentic Italian food in Madison. Hands down. The serving sizes are large. I've had better service but there's isn't terrible."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise!!!!!!  VERY authentic!  We had four different dishes and we loved all of them.  Pasta cooked correctly, nothing too oily, perfectly seasoned.  Good service, too.  Not the prettiest atmosphere but not terrible.  Reasonable prices.  The BEST cannoli I have ever had, and I come from an Italian community.  Will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The entire experience was pretty awful. The wait staff was nice, but we went without drinks for over 45 minutes after initial round of drinks. It took over an hour for our food to show up at our table once we placed our order. The entire experience took over two hours, which was just unnecessarily long. We started off with some calamari, and it rubbery, cold, and it tasted really fishy. I ordered the Rigatoni Salsiccia and it was one of the worst Italian dishes I've ever experienced. The cream sauce had little to no flavor, the broccoli was under-cooked, and the so-called Italian sausage, no joke, tasted like breakfast sausage. I had a few other people in our party try my dish and nobody liked it. My wife's risotto was equally as bad. I couldn't get home quick enough to use some mouthwash and take some Tums."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We had lasagna, spaghetti, 2 kids pizzas with drinks and one beer for $37 with tax. Service was very nice and attentive too."}
{"text":"Best pasta delivery in Madison... I've never eaten in the restaurant, but have ordered delivery from them twice now. Both times the pasta arrived at the right temperature and al dente. The sauces are flavorful and well prepared. I ordered the farfalle rustica most recently. The chicken was a bit dry, but the rest of the sauce had a wonderful flavor. I also ordered canoli for desert. It was lovely. The mascarpone filling was sweet, but not too sweet. Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  We didn't really see any signage from the street so we drove by it.  We went there for dinner.  To be honest, I was a little concerned, because it wasn't very busy.  We had a reservation for 9 for 6pm and our table was ready.  We had nice crispy herb bread to dip into olive oil balsamic mix.  I can't remember the name of the dish I had , buy it was a spicy red sauce on penne.  I added the panchetta and was glad I did. Really nice plate of food . Good service."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Italian restaurant in town. Simple, no frills, good value food. The seafood selection of pasta are so reasonably priced. Lots of food for 1 person. 

Mondays and Tuesdays are half price days for wine. Wine selection is ordinary. 

The white wine garlic sauce pasta with clans is really good. 

Outside seating during good weather is also available. The inside is very unassuming and the customers around are also really nice. 

Dinner for two and don't want to waste food? I recommend the deep fried calamari (lightly battered and fresh squid) and a pasta dish to share. Comes with bread. That way you can have wine and dessert too."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  It was just okay.  The pasta was good overall, but was rather 1 toned.  The pizza was less impressive.... the vegetables were burned and it was overall under seasoned, the service was good."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Nonno's to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal. The staff is wonderful. The food is even better. Starting with a basket of hot bread and a dipping plate. We had pasta, seafood and steak and all was amazing. Save room for dessert though, the tiramisu will put a huge smile on your face! My only wish is that they change out the previous Mexican restaurant decorations and bring in a 100% Italian theme."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. My wife and I wanted some Italian so we looked up some restaurants and reviews and decided to give this place a try for lunch. When we got there the waitress brought us some bread with olive oil dipping sauce. The bread was deliciously soft with a slight crunch on the crust. We ordered some CALAMARI LUCIANA for appetizer and that was amazing. The calamari was perfectly cooked with a great aroma from the mixed herbs and wine tomato sauce. Dipping the bread into the tomato based sauce was even better! I had the TORTELLINI DI CARNE because I wanted the veal. The dish tasted fantastic! My wife ordered the 
PENNE ALL' ARRABBIATA which was great. They also asked if we wanted our dishes topped off with some fresh parmesan when it came out. We finished off with the TIRAMISU for desert. The prices were absolutely affordable, portions were plentiful, and food fare tasted excellent. All in all this place absolutely delivered in customer service and food. I will definitely be coming back again to try other dishes! I still can't believe I haven't tried this place until today even though I drive past it multiple times."}
{"text":"I love the layout of the menu, it was not too overwhelming with choices and I really felt comfortable asking our server about the different choices.  We ordered the Chicken Genovese and lasagna, and while we waited, were served some fantastic (and light) bread with oil and balsamic vinegar.  Oh my. I could have had that for lunch, it's taste was just right.  The Chicken Genovese was very tasty, I liked the way the pesto sauce was so delicate but gave it enough taste to the noodles and was a back seat to the tasty chicken.  My husband took one bite of the lasagna and asked me why we hadn't been there sooner?  We just never had the chance now that we're not living in the neighborhood.  I will be back to try other dishes. It was very comfortable place to have conversation and eat some excellent italian food!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

I went for restaurant week and was a little underwhelmed, but I feel like on a normal day with the full menu it could be better. The restaurant menu mostly had items that weren't on their usual menu. I loved the bread and the carpaccio appetizer. The bread was warm, crispy on the edges, and super soft on the inside, and I will pretty much never say no to raw meat...I got their grilled ribeye for the entree and it was cooked medium and quite tender, but a bit salty and they didn't ask me how I wanted it. I had the tiramisu for dessert, and it was too watery and the espresso flavor wasn't strong enough. Overall I didn't think the meal was worth the $30 for restaurant week, compared to the other places I went to. Their normal menu has a lot of options isn't very pricey in the first place though, so I can see myself coming back to try other items. 

The service wasn't the best; the waiter was friendly, but took a very long time between our entree and dessert, even though we were one of the only customers there due to the snow. He also didn't ask how we wanted the checks, and seemed surprised that our group of 7 wanted split checks."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my husband wanted his birthday dinner at this restaurant -- our first visit. It was fantastic! I had the pesto salmon and everything about it was perfect. I forget exactly what my husband had but it was a pasta with Italian sausage and he agreed that his was perfect too. And to top it off, they gave us a huge piece of tiramisu with a lit candle for his birthday dessert. Delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant. The cost was similar to Angelo's but Angelo's serves salad with the meal, whereas it was extra at Nonno's."}
{"text":"Had lunch here.  Place is clean, but a little hokie with the decor.   Service was pleasant and relatively fast.   They cater to children well.   The menu had all the Italian greatest hits at reasonable prices.   Not a destination Italian joint, but not a bad choice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Nonno's is a typical surburban Italian restaurant, offering vegetarian pastas, salads, and entrees focused on cheese and eggplant. I looked at the bar and the liquor and saw some aged bourbon, so I had some higher expectations for the $10-$20 pastas, but the food didn't deliver.

I was with a few friends for dinner on a weekend. It took about 35 minutes for us to order, but that was our fault: we were waiting on a final friend, and that kind of reset this server \"timer\". 

I split the farfalle alla norma with a friend, and order the caprese salad for myself. The caprese salad was good, but if you check the picture, you can see the lovely shadow my hands cast on the plate, as well as a real lack of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I really liked the mozzarella and tomatoes. The farfalle was overcooked. The eggplant was fine, but when you start wondering how easy the dish is to make at home, you realize that you're not having a great food experience. The box of pasta at home says 9 minutes for al dente and 11 minutes for fully cooked. 

For what it's worth, my vegetarian friend ordered some pasta with ricotta on it and it was very bad. Avoid the penne ricotta e pomodoro. There was some kind of birthday, homecoming, whatever girls in dresses dinner going on right behind me, so I feel like Nonno's has some rapport in the community."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday around 4:30. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time but we don't live in the area and only get here a few times a year. 
We were seated immediately  staff was friendly and attentive. The booths are roomy and comfortable. The place is clean and I really like the atmosphere. 
My friend had veal parmigiana. Two big pieces of veal on noodles with mushrooms and fresh herbs. I had lasagna. The sauce and meat were great.  It didn't compare to Gino's but was the closest I've had. I gave 4 stars because the noodles were over done and it could have used a laddle of sauce on it.  I tasted the veal and it was very good. We had side salads that were good but not included with meal and not worth 4.00 each. The bread was free, fresh and very good with olive oil and balsamic. 
I will go back to try other dishes. I like this place. The sauce and service get five stars."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant, and it will be my last. The italiano starter was good and my dining partners pizza was ok. I however will go home to cook my meal now. A carbonara has black pepper, yes, but not the whole pepper mill. I couldn't taste anything else and you could see that there was almost more pepper than noodles.  I was infomed then that carbonara is derrived from the word pepper (not accurate- Italian, literally 'charcoal kiln,' perhaps influenced by carbonata, a dish of charcoal-grilled salt pork.) Instead of offering to remake it I could chose something else. (probably with a side of spit)  I will go elsewhere from now on. I'm one to order a starter  main  and sweet treat, the server would have had 20% tip on a $70 check. I would have tipped for it anyway normally, but insulting your customers knowledge on something she loves to eat will not win you any tip. The visit  was a waste of my night and I will now be taking my hour commute home and still have to make a meal for myself as my dining partner actually had a meal."}
{"text":"This was a very hard 5 stars to give. I don't normally give 5 stars. My fiancé and I went to this restaurant because she wanted Italian and we went on yelp to see what was rated #1. This restaurant was not only #1 but was actually pretty close to our hotel. Everything from the complimentary bread to the dessert we ordered was amazing. The only problem was the speed at which everything was served. We literally walked in the same time as another couple and we were actually seated the same exact time they were. They were paying for the bill before we even were served our main course. We waited longer than expected for the bread to be served, our appetizer, main courses, and then the dessert. I want to give this restaurant 4 stars because of the speed but each meal we had was literally worth the wait."}
{"text":"We visited the evening of 3/3/15 while spending a week in Verona. This was our best meal of the entire trip! I strongly recommend this restaurant for their delicious Italian plates. The waitress Maria was warm and professional and helped describe the menu choices and also helped us choose a nice bottle of wine. The seating was very comfortable, private, pleasant and clean. It was easy to have comfortable conversations while indulging in fantastic food. They also had no problem with itemized bills, amex etc.If you are staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Verona they will arrange free transportation.  So what are you waiting for? Try the Risotto Di Pesca, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"For starters, the prices are amazing. You can get a lot of food for a really good price. I was in town for a work event and wanted some good food. I got a side salad with chicken parm and some wine. It was reallllllllllllly goooooood. The portions are big. It's a lot of food. The whole table was so quiet and they all thanked me at the end of the night. The chicken parm was made to perfection. I asked them to make it spicy and they did. I will be coming back soon when I get back into town."}
{"text":"I saw some really bad reviews about his place and was hoping they were wrong and they were! This restaurant is still one of the best in Madison. The service and food are excellent. I had the special this time. It was Red Snapper on a bed of pasta with a red sauce that was excellent. The mussel appetizers were as good as it gets and the salads as well. The place was fairly busy this Saturday night which is good. If you haven't tried it here yet do so. In the four or five times we have been here we have never had any problems with anything. The waitstaff is profession and friendly and the food and drinks great. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Just your average Italian restaurant. Reminds me a lot of a local version of Olive Garden. The menu is gigantic, which always makes me wonder why not narrow and specialize in fewer, better dishes."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Nonna's tonight- it was our first time trying this place and it was seriously disappointing.  My husband has pasta that was so salty it was almost inedible.  I got a Mediterranean salad that was made with mealy tomatoes and yellow lettuce.  I couldn't believe how inferior the ingredients were.  I'm not sure if we'll ever try the dine in experience and give it another chance but the only reason that I might consider it would be for another piece of tiramisu....that was 2 stars worth."}
{"text":"Just moved here from NYC so I know good Italian. By far the best Italian I have had in Madison. Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Was our backup choice for dinner when initial had too much of a wait. Service was good, very prompt. Food was good, not fabulous , actually commented that the recipe I use for meatballs is better. Will probably make a return visit."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pasta. Decently priced. Large portion, you can definitely take home some. All the pasta dishes are very delicious. The seafood is fresh. And most importantly it was homie and authentic. The dessert wasn't very special though so if you are full from your entree don't waste money on dessert"}
{"text":"Well, we really wanted to love this place, and we will definitely be going back to give them another try. They've just opened, so still having some growing pains, clearly. Same owners of the previous restaurant in this location (Cancun), and they have quite a bit of experience with Italian restaurants. Our waiter claimed to be from Italy, and was very friendly and helpful (though he forgot to put in the order for our appetizer - Vegan Carpaccio - zucchini and arugula! - turned out to be a blessing in disguise cuz we were stuffed anyway, without it). Really good bread, served with oil and balsamic. Nice wine list, and not too pricey. Lots of wine by the glass options - I had a Sangiovese for $5.50. We kept seeing the food runner wandering around with plates of food, destination unknown - tried to give us plates twice, before we had even ordered. Hubby ordered pizza, but was served the wrong one - he liked the toppings on the one he received, so didn't say anything. Toppings were good - pancetta, artichokes, mushrooms and anchovies, but the crust was not good - doughy on top, too crunchy on the bottom. I went with my staple seafood pasta with red sauce. It was AWESOME and not good, at the same time. The shrimp, clams and scallops were AMAZING - and lots of it! But the swordfish was fishy tasting - I picked it all out after the first couple of bites. Not a big fan of mussels or octopus, but I dutifully ate it - cooked well. The pasta was cooked PERFECTLY, and the sauce was delicious. They did a really great job converting the decor over to Italian...very comfortable and pleasant. We are for sure going to give them another chance, on the basis of their pasta skilz alone. Very yummy."}
{"text":"This was the sixth time I have eaten here. The service is always spot on!  Risotto and fresh pasta are always superb. Some of the best tiramisu around Dane County. Lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I did not expect a small Italian restaurant in a strip mall to be so good.  Nonno's has been one of the more welcome surprises since my move to Madison.

Apparently this place was a Mexican restaurant before I moved here, and evidence of its former life is still present in the decor, which is fine.  The decor doesn't actually alter the taste of the food.  I would actually not mind having a slightly more romantic dinner at this place at all, so the slightly incongruous decor isn't that obtrusive.  Another thing I inexplicably get a kick out of is that all of the wait staff speaks Spanish and they sometimes have a soccer game on at the bar, which isn't what you'd expect at a stereotypical Italian place, but it's a fun piece of character.

They also have food, like many restaurants, so I guess I should talk about that.  I have repeatedly and unabashedly enjoyed the Rigatoni Salsiccia several times, and though it's just a tiny bit on the salty side, the sausage is really nicely done and the pasta is always cooked right.  They take the care to do it the right way instead of letting it get overdone and floppy, which is a commonly neglected area.

One area where Nonno's continuously excels is in their sauces.  From my own orders and stolen bites from other plates, I can honestly say that they don't make a bad sauce that I've tried.  

Overall, thumbs up for Nonno's.  There's never a wait, the staff is polite and attentive, and the food is really good.  Personally, I hope there's always a trace of Mexican restaurant here.  It gives the place character."}
{"text":"Hit the Yelp app to cure a pasta craving as I approached Odana Road. Wanted to see what the Yelpers had to say though I find \"The OG\" plenty tasty. Nonno's was nearest so I popped in late lunchtime. 

Yes, the Mexican decor is still here from the restaurants former life, with tiles made in Mexico (it's printed on them) and music in Spanish rather than Italian (or even Sinatra and Martin). But if you seek a reasonably priced locally owned Italian restaurant, Nonno's is worth a try.

The food was OK. My dining companion beat me to the punch on the spaghetti and meatballs order so I diversified with the Farfalle Rustico. Had a couple bites of the spaghetti and meatballs which was traditional and tasty. The Rustico, not sure if this is a Nonno's original but I found it unusual. There were a few pepper strips that were pretty much raw. The peas I think came from frozen. The mushrooms, I don't know enough about to know if they were fresh. Chicken did not seem fresh grilled. No color. The dish didn't have visual flair.

A focaccia style bread is warmed and comes quickly for all tables which is nice. I would have liked a soup or salad with the entree but $10 for what I got was fair. 

+Service is prompt and attentive without being overbearing.
+Half price wine bottles on early week nights and happy hour specials also available.
-ambiance - too Mexican (the music, mostly). 

There were several items on the menu that sounded tasty, so I will give this place another shot in the future. Yelpers let me know if the rigatoni and lasagna are any good!"}
{"text":"We had the spaghetti carbonara and the penne.  Very delicious. My boyfriend didn't care for the anchovies in the penne, so matteo generously provided him with a new dish of his choice.

A+ service and personality..thank you matteo.

This was a first time and we will return!"}
{"text":"For the price, one of the better Italian options on the west side. They provide quick service, and have really fair prices. I love the warm focaccia bread with oil and balsamic to start the meal there. The menu is large and has a lot of seafood options, which is a nice change if you aren't looking for just pasta. 

This is definitely a place we will be back to."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it! Excellent food and service. We started with the focaccia and oil. Then had the house side salad. Then  the lasagna and a couple other of the main pasta dishes. No complaints from anyone. Our server was fun and humorous which added to the experience. We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Have been several times whenever I'm in Madison, and the food and service are always top notch.  We like to bring my grandmother here, and the staff is always extremely accommodating of her dietary restrictions.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place clearly used to be a Mexican joint because they still have a lot of the decor up. I guess they never bothered to renovate. I couldn't care less

Portions and price are reasonable. Our favorites are the salmon pasta, the sage gnocchi, and the 4 cheese pasta. The salads and complementary fresh bread are pretty good too. However I would avoid the soup. The minestrone isn't very good and the soup of the day is pretty clearly made from whatever ingredients they had that were about to go bad. Get a booth because the chairs are uncofortable"}
{"text":"We dined at Nonno ristorante on Saturday, the drinks, salad and soups and pastas diners were excellent. The servers were very helpful. The bread and olive oil was specular."}
{"text":"If you are sick of the over-priced, extremely over-hyped second rate food of Olive Garden then this is the place for you. I absolutely love this restaurant. Every dish that my friends, family and I order comes out tasting absolutely delicious!
My personal favorite dish is the 'Farfalle Rustico'; just thinking about it makes my stomach rumble and yearn for it. As far as desserts, they are all pretty standard for an Italian restaurant but the Tiramisu is my personal favorite. I highly recommend it!
The servers are always friendly and attentive, and the owner can always be seen running around helping out the servers and laughing with customers (which I prefer to see, rather than an owner who simply stands in one place and barks out orders at their servers).
I also order carry-out from here quite often, and the preparation time is simply beyond compare. I can order my food by phone, drive over, run in, pay for it, and easily be on my merry way all under 15 minutes.
I will continue to return to this restaurant and recommend it to everyone. You will not regret giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Food was fresh, great traditional flavors, and the staff was super friendly! So glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nonno's a couple of times now, and I've had pleasant experiences every time. The staff is friendly, they have a variety of food offered on the menu and the food itself is very enjoyable. We really like the calamari, the marinara sauce that comes with it has a small spicy bite to it that I enjoyed. I've liked every entree I've tried. Your meal comes with focaccia bread and balsamic vinegar/oil - which tastes really good. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for Italian food."}
{"text":"Really impressive, delicious food, and a great value for the price! Husband and I split a pizza and a pasta dish for lunch. Good quality food and well prepared- the pasta was al dente and the ingredients seemed fresh, not like the ambiguous mush you'd get at the Olive Garden. 

The only downside is the ambiance and decor, looks like it used to be a Mexican restaurant, and the cheesiness remains complete with plaster archways and precariously perched terra cotta tiles over the booths. Not offensive, just shabby and unimpressive. I probably wouldn't bring company here because of this. 

I will continue to come to this place for the great food in a casual setting. We were dressed casually and had the baby with us and it was no problem."}
{"text":"Came here during the first day of Restaurant Week, 2015. I agree with the comment below regarding Nonno's has an identity crisis. 

Negatives:
~There is nothing italian about the restaurant at all. No even an \"Italian\" smell. They really need to serious make over. 
~The tables seemed very old and the chairs (booths) were uncomfy. 
~Part of the ceiling were covered with this weird title plastic. I can't really explain it.
~Tables were far too close to each other. It is a major peeve of mines. I don't want to hear other tables conversations. I like privacy and I am sure other diners do as well.
~ I am reluctant to say this because it could have just been one (two)  bad drink(s) but I hard by far the WORST Sangria ever here. Didn't bother to complain about it. I just left it untouched mostly as well as my boyfriend. Really hope the bartender can do better than what he/she served us.

Positives
~ Friendly staff
~Large portion sizes
~ You're served bread, oil and balsamic vinegar complimentary of Nonno's. Bread was great
~ Food times were ridiculous fast! We were there less than an hour total. Granted, there weren't a lot of diner there but still, it was quite impressive
~ Fantastic menu. Lots to choose from but not to the point where you're overwhelmed by the menu.
~Unlike many other Italian restaurants, our meals were not overloaded with garlic or cheese.
~ Pocket friendly $$$$$

Overall, I really enjoyed the food. The biggest complaint I have was Nonno's decor. They REALLY need some help. Other than that, I was pretty happy. I will return in the future."}
{"text":"Went out with some work colleagues. Service was great. I had the red Sangria which was very good. They do the usual Italian fare with the oil and bread. The lasagna was a very large portion for a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend this place if you are near Madison."}
{"text":"Nonno's is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Madison, right up there with Cafe La Bellitalia. Service is friendly and quick (Tony is a great waiter), and you can order any item on the menu and enjoy it. I try to come here once a month, and the servers remember my name every time. The warm bread and oil/balsamic is an excellent start to each meal, and they have a variety of options including seafood. My 12 year-old son loves to come here every year for his birthday. You get a free dessert from the menu (with a candle in it) that serves the whole family and all of the staff come out to sing Happy Birthday. The tiramisu is my favorite of the desserts. Their children's menu is inexpensive for what you get at other places for $5.95, and the cheese they use for their children's pizza is amazing. Everyone in my family comes here for birthdays and other celebrations, and my parent's condo association comes here every month for dinner, and they are very accommodating of all of their specific health/dietary needs. I order something different every time, and all of those times, I have left full, excited to return, and ready to try a new dish."}
{"text":"We recently visited Nonno's for a family birthday. I had never been there before and so I was looking forward to the visit. I also rarely eat pasta so this was a treat. We had a wonderful night. The wait staff was friendly and the food was good. We did not have an appetizer but we did have desert and that was delicious. I would recommend this for anyone looking for new place to check out. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't had Italian this good in quite some time. I and my date gave Nonno's a try after an emphatic recommendation from friends who know good food. We were not disappointed. The waitstaff was fantastic, and while I can see what some people are saying about the aesthetics of the place I really don't care what it looks like if the food is good. We seriously could have eaten in a bare white room and I'd not have complained.

My companion had the calamari appetizer while I had a delicious salad with sliced apples, strawberries and fennel with a vinaigrette dressing. We were pleased by the time we finished our firsts, and then the entrees came. Mine was the most delicious, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth gnocchi I've ever eaten; in a mouth-watering sage cream cheese sauce. My date had a salmon pasta and raved about the sauce and combination of fresh and smoked salmon. We shared a piece of tiramisu to finish.

I've since recommended it to my coworkers, and we ended up having a staff meeting there. Rave reviews all around. I plan on spreading the word to all I know so that this great place can stay in business (the location hasn't been great to the restaurants there in the past).

This goes into our rotation of places to go out when we do. I can't wait to try many of the other dishes on the menu. Yum!"}
{"text":"If there was a 3.75 stars, I'd use it. But this place deserves at least a 4 star for putting something good and unique in an otherwise authentic food desert. 

I was craving Italian and refused to give decent money to Olive Garden, so I tried Nonno's. 

What I had: Free, warm bread (seemed homemade, foccacia-like), PAGLIA E FIENO ALLA TOSCANA - Egg and spinach fettuccine, with onions, diced pancetta, imported prosciutto, wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes & pecorino Romano cheese in a dry white wine cream sauce, a glass of red wine.

Pros: 
-Open late so that I didn't feel rushed. 
-Friendly, efficient service
-Great menu. Excellent variety, well organized, heard them say they could amend just about anything to accommodate a vegetarian. 
-Well priced. I could have free bread, a nice sized plate of pasta with high quality ingredients, and a decent glass of wine (it seemed an ample pour, too) for $22. Perfectly in line with my expectations.
-Homemade pasta options
-Beautiful presentation
-Tasted fresh
-Serving size was as-expected. Enough to bring home leftovers for a light lunch.

Cons:
-My pasta could've used a little more \"pop\" in flavor. I added some salt at the table and that helped. Fresh ground pepper also would've helped. It wasn't offered (there was regular black pepper in a shaker at the table) and I didn't bother asking for fresh because it wasn't a big deal. 

I will try them again and continue to explore the menu. They probably won't edge out two of my other Italian favorites in town (Osteria Papavero, Lombardinos), but they are A LOT easier on the pocket book, so will get more frequent business from me. Based on this visit and the menu, I'd put them just above Benvenutos and on par with Tutto's (which makes sense with their past experience, and I think their ability to finesse a dish is higher than Tutto's) on the local Italian scene."}
{"text":"Nonno's is wonderful! The food is absolutely delicious. However, the best part is the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful no matter how busy they are. It has a very intimate setting perfect for small family gatherings or dates. Tony has always been my waiter and he is always incredibly attentive, helpful, and fun to talk to. I could not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way down to Chicago Northwest suburbs from the Northwoods. With the help of YELP
we found Nonno's & we were very pleased. This restaurant-has very good food for outskirts Madison WI.
We had Burrata capris salad special, raw oysters were fresh fresh. My son & husband the Arrabiata Pasta. Excellent. I had the Pasta Fieno Toscano very good. 
My family agreed that we will diffidently stop here on our way up to Northwoods or on our way Down home."}
{"text":"Nonno's is my placeholder un-fussy Italian place near my house. It's...ok. Sometimes we want some takeout Italian and this usually scratches the itch, although never really excites me. It's not knock-your-socks-off good but it does the trick when craving a basic Italian meal. 

The people who own this place used to operate it as a Mexican restaurant, but decided at some point to switch to Italian. Since they used to work at Tutto Pasta, it's basically the same menu as Tutto Pasta. They still have a lot of the Mexican decor from its previous incarnation, which with the stucco and tiled roof stuff could also be interpreted as \"Italian,\" but then you've got Mexican beer neon signs in the windows and Mexican music on the stereo. I choose to enjoy this little quirk. 

Anyway, this is a placeholder because what I really want is a local mom-n-pop red sauce Italian joint, with big portions, where I can get takeout and bring it home and eat like half of my entree and have a bunch of leftovers to snack on at 1 am, and Nonno's doesn't quite do that. 

They mess with basic recipes by adding a bunch of dairy where it shouldn't be, or trying to turn stuff like chicken marsala into an entree by serving it with potatoes and veggies instead of over pasta. I want red sauce or pesto that's not been messed up with a bunch of cream, I want penne with sausage and peppers without a bunch of ricotta added for no good reason, and all I want with my chicken parm is a big slab of breaded chicken over spaghetti with a bunch of red sauce and cheese on top. 

Cafe La Bellitalia over on the east side really is more of what I have in mind, but for me as a southwest-sider it's not quite a convenient takeout joint."}
{"text":"I've been back to Nonno's a couple of times since my previous review and perhaps I've just chosen entrees they do better with but the quality does seem to have improved since my March 2015 review.

I've been vacillating between 3 and 4 starts and decided on 4 (since I'd was leaning 3.5 / 3.75 and those don't exist). 

Mrs. T continues to swear by their risi e bisi (and it is very good) and the couple of times we've been back I've opted on dishes that use white sauces and they are quite delicious (although my heart may disagree). This leaves me wondering if it's their red sauce that needs work and I was just ordering the wrong things? 

Enough waxing philosaucical, however, I've got to say -- they're white sauces have won me over!"}
{"text":"First time lunch experienced with a co-worker.  Attentive service and very good food.  We were served hot bread right away which smelled delicious and tasted wonderful.  We both enjoyed the Cesar salad which was perfectly dressed, and we split the Margherita pizza.  The pizza was good but was missing the tomatoes.  And we split the Profiteroles which was a tasty dish. 

There was Italian music playing overhead at a soft volume so they must have corrected that from another review. But whatever station or CD they were using included Christmas songs!  But it was snowing a little so could have been just showing a sense of humor. 

I would definitely return. Would be a good place for a larger group lunch.  Plenty of space and a nice menu selection."}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic Italian fare and found it here!!  Wait staff excellent and food was very good!!  This will be the go to for us when we want Italian and recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great meal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Sunday evening. First time, but it won't be our last. From appetizers to dessert, it was absolutely delicious. 

Started out with some drinks and fried calamari. Do get the fried calamari because it was a large portion with tentacles too. Sauce was great (had a little spice to it) and the calamari was just nice and crispy with a light batter. 

I ordered the Paglia E Fieno Alla Toscana. All I can say it was soooo delicious. The noodles were hand made and the sauce was tasty. Mushrooms, onions, prosciutto and pancetta, tomatoes. My wife had the Penne Al Salmone and that was very delicious as well. 

For dessert we shared cannoli and tiramisu. Both very good. We like to shop around for cannoli's and these rank up there. The service was great and the decor of the place is very nice. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and drinks. Prices were competitive and reasonable we thought. Definitely coming back and telling everyone."}
{"text":"The only downside to this place is that it's so close to where I live--could eat here every week. Have not had a bad dish here, and I try to sample all around the menu, but the risi e bisi and gnocchi with sage cream sauce are two knockouts. The decor is at odds with the cuisine since it retains most of the former Cancun interior, but I don't go there for the decor. The food is terrific and the staff is friendly and attentive without bugging you. Oh, and the house salad is always fresh and crisp--heads above most side salads."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant was very good. Solid food. Someone in my party ordered the lasagna and it seemed microwaved which was disappointing. Everyone else loved their food though! And the portions were big enough to take half home and have another meal which was nice."}
{"text":"Decided to give this Italian spot a try during restaurant week.  The decor is fine for a location that has switched formats a few times.  The booths looked comfortable and the tables were arranged well.

My group of three was greeted promptly and warmly.  I will say the service from host to server to other staff clearing were top notch.  We were given the regular menu and the restaurant week menu.  I was the only one who ordered off the special menu.  I ordered the carpaccio starter, the veal scallopini parmesan with risotto, and tiramisu.  My pals ordered off the regular menu: they started with the squash carpaccio.  Entrees were pesto and chicken over penne pasta and cannelloni ai formaggi.  They split the canoli for dessert.

My dishes were delicious but there were some flaws.  I think those flaws have to do with restaurant week and the pre-planning that some locations do.  The pesto dish was extremely good.  I would get that if I were to stop in again.  The cannelloni was enjoyed by that friend and he won't share.  

Nonno's may score higher on my next visit when I order off the regular menu."}
{"text":"Had the lemon tilapia, and it was delicious. The bread was perfect. Beverage service was complicated, but an apology was provided for the issue. The chicken Parmesan was also great."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week, and wow! That's really good Italian food! Strong in flavor, nice desserts, and good service."}
{"text":"I went here for my 26th birthday and had a great experience. 

When we pulled up to the restaurant, I noticed the location was familiar. Ironically enough this place was previously a Mexican restaurant, where I didn't have a very good experience. Needless to say the past is in the past. :)

The ambience is very peaceful and the staff were quite friendly and attentive. 

The pasta I ordered was incredible and indulgent - house made spinach pasta with chicken and mushrooms in a white wine cream and parley sauce. Perfection. 

My fiancé ordered Bolognese with no cheese and his request was successfully. He sometimes has a difficult time at Madison restaurants when requesting no cheese, so we always get a little too excited when places get his order right. :)

I'd definitely go back and recommend that others try. 

The price point and quality of good will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and its not bad. I didnt have very high expectations for this place since it looks like the owners of the Mexican restaurant that used to be here just changed cuisine not actual ownership. I wasn't sure what their experience with Italian cuisine would be.

Its within walking distance of my work. Once we came with a group large group from work. Service was great for such a large party. Most people got drinks and they were surprisingly good. The food is your average Italian fare not super traditional but tasty. I got their pesto dish which was pretty good and they were very accommodating when I asked to add and take away some things. We also got a bunch of desserts for our large party they were good but doubt the were homemade.

We might come back here if the craving hits and we don't want to go far for a taste of Italian food. But I'm sure my coworkers and bosses will arrange another outing here as its close and service was good."}
{"text":"Had a craving for fried calamari, and was not disappointed! Lightly fried and tender, the warm marinara that accompanied it was perfect.
The Chicken Parmesan was 1st rate, and the server suggested ordering it with grilled veggies instead of pasta next time (since he left most to avoid carbs).
Love the food here!! Great service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Glaciers move faster.  Lots of apologies.  Italiano appetizer was equivalent to Oscar Meyer meats.  Risotto wss ok, but half the mussels didn't open, which I think means they are bad so I didn't eat them.  Boring foods, terrible service."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I tried this restaurant during Restaurant Week 2017 and we we're quite impressed.  I can't speak to the prices since it was a set menu, but what we had was savory and well seasoned.  The sauces were creamy, flavorable, and greatly portioned.  The service was just okay though.  For a restaurant that wasn't that busy for lunch, they did take a while to come out and greet us.  However, as the hour went on, they became a lot more attentive.  This place I'll try again; maybe for dinner this time.  The rigatoni with white wine sauce and mushrooms will be worth the trip."}
