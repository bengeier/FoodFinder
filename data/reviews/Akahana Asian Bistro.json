{"text":"Tried this place again for a friend's celebratory dinner. We had another server on her 'first day'. She seemed sincere and I believe her, but I've also gotten this excuse before.  Tonight one order didn't come out at all and one came out with an incorrect mix of rolls. The story was another server grabbed the plates, but it took another 30 minutes after acknowledging the mistake to be served our original order. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I used to absolutely love this restaurant. The rolls were awesome and so we're the dishes I've tried (curry, lo mein, soups, fried rice, tofu,etc). My liking for this place changed after I found the tail of a bug in my takeout food!!!! The manager said an exterminator came out and the only thing he can conclude is that the bugs came out to breathe bc they were suffocating from the fumes....wtf?!?! He only offered to buy me another meal as of I'd step foot in there again. I demanded they put the money back on my card which he said he'd look into but never did. Poor customer service and disgusting establishment."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday evening and the ambiance was great.  Just the right amount of lighting.  Lots of tables for couples to larger groups.  I spotted a traditional Japanese dining room in the back, near the bathrooms, which would be a cool thing to do with a bunch of people.  The restaurant just opened so they didn't have draft beer yet but the hot tea was perfect for a cold winter night and the wine & mixed drink menu looked comprehensive.  Everything we ordered was very good - garlic crusted calamari, miso soup, three sushi rolls (Dragon which is shrimp/eel, spicy tuna, Mary which is like a California roll).  Service was very good - not pretentious - I think we saw some CAST actors working as well as some other Plaza Midwood neighborhood faces.  I hope this place survives since the location seems to be cursed like the Cursed Pirate Girl (Jeremy Bastian reference y'all).  And check out the used book store next door if you have time - just watch out for their puss who, like most pusses, can be cranky when approached the wrong way.  Cheerio!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time a couple days ago. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. I was amazed at their buy one get one free sushi rolls deal..Their spicy edamame was the bomb..Will definetly we returning!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.we went because of the positive reviews. I have never posted a review before but it was so bad I felt compelled to try to warn others. It was by far THE WORST meal I can remember, not just in Charlotte. It was greasy, fatty, sauces out of a bottle (tastes like it anyway), sushi was old and gross. Just disgusting and then the whole place was flooded with a the foul smell of rotten fish (you know the smell if you have ever been in a grocery store with bad fish)! Just wretched. I'm sorry but I just have to try to warn you."}
{"text":"I was a regular lunch customer and service at first was amazing. Then there was a shift in management and the service level went to the dogs. The food is not as good as it was when the business first opened and now it is mediocre. The owner is not pleasant and needs a course is customer service. When a customer is not satisfied with the taste or if there is an ingredient in the meal that the customer can not have, you do not tell the customer that you will not take it off the bill!  I am glad I have a backbone and know how to address these issues.Customer Sevice 101 your customers are the reason you're in business."}
{"text":"Akahana has a wide selection but food is pretty average. Their sushi isn't great but isn't bad.  It's one of those places you go to when nobody in your group can decide on where to go for dinner because of it's wide selection."}
{"text":"Sushi is good. Spicy edamame is the reason I continue to go. Whatever that sauce is, is divine. Service at the Plaza Midwood location is not good. I have had a couple run-ins with the hostess. First, she left me on hold for 17 minutes, I hung up. Called back and she put me on hold for another 10 minutes, I hung up and decided to just walk in and place a take out order. The restaurant had maybe 5 tables in the entire place so it wasnt during a rush. No big deal, that wasnt the tipping point. The last time I went in to place a take out order I asked if I could get the sauce for the spicy edamame on the side as extra sauce and was lectured by the hostess that it couldn't. However, they were able to put it on the side of my plain edamame. Again, not a big deal but I didnt appreciate her tone towards me when I simply asked a question. So she argued with me and spoke down to me saying I didnt understand what she was saying...which I then just ignored, paid my bill then left. I rarely leave bad reviews but this one had my blood boiling.Sorry but not sorry. Waitress we had wasnt that good either on a seperate visit. Bartender always seems like she is too busy doing other things than to wait on the patrons at the bar. Which seems odd since other people are bringing the food out for her. That was on two other visits that I took notice. So in all, each time I have visited this location it was bad service. The other location out towards Fort Mill is great. Service is great. Hire a better staff, cause your sushi isnt that amazing. Rusans is better."}
{"text":"I have always thought the sushi here was mediocre.  Not only this, but BOGO is a rip off. How can they get away with charging $9 for a California roll is beyond me. Not only that, but they add gratuity based on the price of these free rolls. Go to Soul Gastrolounge across the street instead, or even the Harris Teeter would suffice."}
{"text":"Akahana is an OK place to go for an great variety of Asian style food. Their veggie sushi is ok and so is the miso soup, however their stir fry sauces are really unimpressive. Also the food seems to be pretty inconsistent in quality, ranging from 2 to 4 stars on any given visit.  While tucked away and not very noticeable on the outside, the inside is very nice. It's got a nice dark atmosphere, lots of dinning area, stylish decorations, and a pretty nice bar. The staff are all attentive and nice folk. It would be a good place for a date if the food was better and more consistent."}
{"text":"Word to the wise, Yelpers: Akahana has changed their sushi pricing.  No longer is it BOGO free; instead, it's now buy one, get one 1/2 off.  Nice to have a discount, but a fairly siesmic shift from how they were pricing their sushi.  Call me Sad Panda."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tues night for the BOGO sushi night and surprisingly found out that they are now doing BOGO sushi all day, everyday. Yep, you heard me right, Everyday, which is a good thing so I don't have to wait for a Tu or Th to enjoy some good, cheap sushi.   I'm a vegetarian and I loved the rolls that my sister and I ordered. We got the fresh, vegetable laden Zen Roll which was scumptious. And for free we got the Sweet Garden roll with came with a sauce drizzled on it which was really damn good.   Our server was really sweet and attentive. No complaints. The only thing I can say that it was a bit empty. I'm sure things will pick up though or if nothing else, we'll be back very soon. Thank goodness, it doesn't just have to be on Tuesday or a Thursday!"}
{"text":"I live a mile away from Akahana, so needless to say I have been here more times than I can count. The experience used to be very inconsistent, but lately it's gone downhill. I used to get sushi from here at least once a week on the off-chance I would have a good experience, but the past few months they haven't been able to get my order right once. I only order one roll and add spicy mayo to the order, but recently they use ingredients different than stated on the menu. It's so frustrating that it's not even worth the buy one, get one half off deal anymore.  I used to rave about Akahana, but not anymore. The spicy edamame is the only reason I gave them two stars. It is worth a try, but their sushi is not."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their seafood combination pad thai! It's so hard to find good pad thai here in Charlotte and I think this place is my favorite by far. If you get it extra spicy they add jalapenos in it. The sushi here is just okay, but its a lot cheaper than other mediocre sushi places considering its buy one get one free. The other entree dishes are not that great. Their fried ice cream here is also good. Overall I am a fan of their pad thai and that's why they are getting 4 stars. :)"}
{"text":"I really like the dragon roll so good service wasn't so great but that might just been our waitress"}
{"text":"Really liked this place when it first opened.  The last two times I have been here my food (not sushi) smelled like a chemical cleaner.  When I commented on it, no attempt of resolution.  I guess if you go, stick to the sushi, not the plated dinners."}
{"text":"The first time I visited this place I thought it was pretty good!!  Ended up getting spinach fried rice which was awesome!!  Went back for the second time and they had already changed the menu!!  They had taken off some things I had seen on the first one!  One of them being what I had orderd!!  Ended up getting chicken and vegetables in brown sauce.  Had about two tiny pieces of chicken!!!!  The rest was rice and veggies!  Very disappointing!  Tried it again and the red curry chicken was a little better.  If I'm gonna pay for chicken I want some chicken!!  The service is good though and so are the drinks!  That's the only thing I will go there for!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight with a group of 10 and hardly saw the waitress. It was her first night so we'll give her a break. One person didn't get his rolls until after everyone was finished, another order was wrong and corrected an hour after ordering. Checks took forever to get. All with no comments from the manager. Disappointed. Then the owner told his waitress it was HER mistake. It wasn't all her fault and don't throw your employee under the bus in front of a table full of people who have worked in food service. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Surprised by the generally good reviews here.   Did not receive drinks until after 10 minutes of being seated. Another 10 minutes pass and our server never came back. I assume a manager or the owner stopped by and took our order. 20 minutes later we get our food. The restaurant was less than a third occupied. I was ready to give a one star but the food was decent.  The main thing I see people talk about is the cost. BOGO is always great. The portions were small, ingredients were not fresh, and cost was a little high (BOGO not great if the rolls are overpriced).  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5 star review I love their menu. It is large because it's a BOGO menu. I'm a regular here and I enjoy the sushi the most, it is perfectly priced and made to perfection, not as fresh as an onshore restaurant but great for inland. If you're in college and in the area and you live sushi this is a great spot !"}
{"text":"I like the dollar PBR specials.  The food is great.  Very impressed with the new menu items."}
{"text":"Tables were sticky, sushi chef slow, waitress forgetful, food not so good and they overcharged us $10. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after a recommendation and several reminders from our favorite server at Carpe Diem.    The quality of food at Akahana matched my expectations.  I rarely have high expectation for restaurants that have huge menus and broad food styles.  Akahana serves up the usual suspects from the usual Asian countries, and they do an admirable--though definitely not spectacular--job with their food.    My pho was tasty.  I've certainly had much, much better pho, but, as previously mentioned, I never expected to consume the best of anything here.  Ginny had a few sushi rolls, all of which I considered to be on par with similar items at Sushi 101.   If you're in the area and you're hungry for a decent meal, Akahana fits the bill.  If your expectation is to have the most fabulous Asian dish you've ever experienced, this will not fit the bill."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Delicious food also at a fantastic price. You can't ask for much more than that. Service is always good too. You have to try the spicy edamame and the spicy spider roll!!! Can't go there without getting both. Highly recommend. Unless you're looking for fancy...which, I'm not."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday evening. The wait was about 15 minutes long but that wasn't bad at all considering it was dinner time. I ordered the sesame chicken and my girlfriend took advantage of the buy one get one promotion on the sushi rolls. The sesame chicken is so dank. It's not like the mushy sesame chicken you get from Chinese food places or from the the mall. It's crispy but not too much. The sauce is very good as well and not too sweet."}
{"text":"They get one star because the waitress was friendly and the first two drinks were good (dragon tail and pineapple margarita). After that, it was just bad, so I'll try to keep this short. Calamari, lukewarm and just \"ok\". Fried soft shelled crab, room temp. Explanation for crab temp was that kitchen did the fry job while the sushi chef did the plating and garnishing and the two weren't in synch. When I heard that, I thought it was one of the dumbest kitchen workflow plans I'd ever heard of. I mean, the garnish and plating was just the crab on top of lettuce. So, here's a novel idea ... why not do that first and have it ready for when the crab comes out the fryer?! Common sense. Right? Anyway, my wife ordered the seafood hot pot. It came out and some genius heated it in a way that the lid couldn't be removed due to internal vacuum inside the pot. Waitress had to take it back and get tech support to remove the lid. After tasting it, maybe it was God telling us not to even bother eating it. Oh, and did I mention that the menu said it would have snapper, but they put salmon in there instead (farm raised most likely)? I guess they figured we were too dumb to notice :) Anyway, I ordered the spicy basil dish. That was a fail. My wife ordered the ginger pear martini. That was a special kind of fail because it tasted like Victoria's Secret body scrub ... pear flavor of course. To end this on a positive note (kinda), I will say that the fried rice was good; just wished we knew there was a $1 up-charge for that when we ordered it. Geez. Anyway ... not going back."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from Akahana last night and it was appalling. I rarely write reviews, but I was so upset that we paid nearly $60 for a terrible dinner that I had to warn others to not eat here. The ordering process was fine and the girls that work the front are very nice and helpful. However, the food itself is just horrible - NOT what I would expect for $13-$15 entrees. As one example, the flat noodle dish came with most of the flat noodles congealed together in what was supposed to be a \"sweet brown sauce\" that was actually a soupy, bitter tasting oily sauce that left a horrible aftertaste in your mouth. The sushi, which seems like a great deal because it's buy one get one, was meh at best. The rice paper wrapped appetizer roll was filled with lettuce and some noodles, completely tasteless and instead of the promised peanut sauce came with a clear fish sauce. (The sauce is a personal preference, but the roll itself was spectacularly underwhelming.)   I am so shocked that a place like this can exist, with all of the great restaurants we have now in Charlotte. I promise, I am not one to call out anyone - as any place can have a bad night. But I was so thoroughly unimpressed and so upset over spending so much money on something so bad, that I had to let everyone know."}
{"text":"Service was fine. Taste of food was good. It was relatively expensive for what I got though. Some decent pho and the worst food poisoning I have ever had."}
{"text":"Boo Hiss!  They changed BOGO Free to BOGO 1/2 price.  I hate when businesses build a following and then change the rules.  Sushi wasn't THAT great to begin with but BOGO was the appeal.  You're gonna lose us loyal customers; bad decision."}
{"text":"Fool me twice, shame on me! After a previous horrible experience with the service at Akahana, my wife and I swore off the restaurant.  We decided to give it another shot, and, unsurprisingly, were disappointed again.  Oversized for the amount of staff, our food came out twenty minutes apart... After waiting 50 MINUTES for the first entree.  All the while, waters were not filled, and servers were running around empty handed like headless chickens.  After all that, the sushi was underwhelming.  Never again."}
{"text":"I have already gone twice this week.  This is now one of my top 3 sushi places. The service has been polite and timely.  The sushi itself is really good and they offer BOGO free all day."}
{"text":"Things I like: BOGO rolls (the fact that they offer it), the place looks nice on the inside, uhm...that's it.   Things I don't like: nasty stench of cleaning supplies/old fish/mildew, average sushi, sakitinis were very weak (even if they were on special, I expect them to not taste like flavored water).   I can't help but compare the BOGO deals to those in Raleigh. In Raleigh, almost every sushi place has BOGO all day long. If restaurants keep making their sushi cheaper and cheaper, that's fine by me - as long as it doesn't go down in quality. When I found out Akahana offered BOGO rolls, I thought I'd check it out. Wasn't the best but I couldn't get over the smell right when I walked in.   I can't even remember the rolls I got, I came here a month ago, but the rolls were so lackluster, I don't remember what they were.   Food is average - maybe even below average. Service was good. The girl was new, so she couldn't really suggest anything when I asked her what was good."}
{"text":"Don't order to go food from their to go menu online. Sounds ridiculous but it is true. The to go menu prices on their website are wrong and my ticket was $15 higher than planned. $15? Not a big deal to some however it is still misleading and false advertising.  The \"manager\" even expressed that their web designer is the reason the to go menu is wrong but that I should have ordered from the dine in menu.  Let me cuss for a second. WHY the eff would I order off the dine in menu when I called in a to go order?  The to go menu is still active and yes the prices are still less than the dine in menu. This is just bad management and the most insulting customer service.    They stay fully packed and are busy and have unique food but they lost a hospital worker and this hospital workers' coworkers orders from now on."}
{"text":"Finally got to Akahana. Might as well get this out of the way - yes our waiter sucked, as many have experienced. Galen, if you are reading this, perhaps you should just sell records at Sam Goody's. Or sort the tchotchkes at Manifest...  But we did sit at the bar (no, the sushi bar); and got along rather well with the head chef and the owner. Seems as though they have their sh!t together. We discussed throughput, prepping and sourcing, yadda yadda. We ate sake nigiri (nice), ikura gunkan (nice) and a few rolls I can't remember the names of. Washed it all down with Asahi and all was good.  Bottom line is I think this one will stick in this somewhat cursed location. The sushi was really good, the cook staff is good, the atmosphere is good. The wait staff will turn over, just \"wait.\""}
{"text":"Akahana, I've got a bone to pick with you. I'd heard many, many positive things about this place and was ready to love it. Plus, we live in the 'hood and I want to help keep something going in this spot.   I should be upfront about the fact that we were not in the best mood that night, so when our extremely sweet and upbeat served came around and announced that she'd just tried eel for the first time last night and then really, really, really wanted to give me her suggestions from the sushi menu I was not thrilled. She took my suggestion rejection like a pro, to her credit, and proceeded to place our order. On the plus side, it came in a very reasonable amount of time. On the minus side, yikes. My order was a couple of rolls and several pieces of nigiri. The rolls were okay- not remarkable. I ordered some maguro. It was whitish-pink-grey. It smelled very strong. It was decidedly not ahi or it was in such bad condition that it was unrecognizable. When clearing the table, my server wanted to know if there had been a problem with it, insisted that the chef told her it was maguro, and then after my explanation of how it should look didn't take it off the bill. Sigh. Akahana, we're breaking up. Though I will never return, you might want to hire some servers that know about sushi and have a talk with your chefs or suppliers. And add some kids' menu items.   (I am giving you that two stars out of the goodness of my heart- I really should make it less.)"}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place. The food is OK for the price we always go with the bogo sushi rolls and share them among the table. The drink specials are pretty good. Overall its a good place to go with some friends to start a night out on the town."}
{"text":"Large portions and good food. No free soda refills. Small appetizer portions.  Wonderful place for lunch, but don't go there for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi! Did I mention Buy One Get One Free Sushi Roll? Honestly a hidden gem in Plaza Midwood! I was shopping around Plaza Midwood and was looking for a place nearby that wasn't the typical American style restaurant, using my super handy mobile app I found Akahana Bistro! The quality of the fish is amazing, I have been to a lot of sushi places in Charlotte, and this is one that I will go back to again and again.   They have a lot of variety in Asian cuisine, and usually I wouldn't say that that is a great idea, but Akahana is able to pull it off! :)  I have also tried the rice noddle dish and Pho and both were just like the way my mother makes it! Perfectly seasoned and super fresh!  Highly recommend Akahana Bistro and Bar to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is a place we used to go often...and we stopped going ...but we gave it another chance after six months and the food was great....The new GM seems to have made the difference and great manager and bartender...give it a shot"}
{"text":"LMAO.  Jesus christ these places need to stop with the whole BOGO DEAL.  YOU ARE NOT GETTING A DEAL.  THESE PLACES DOUBLE THEIR PRICES ON SUSHI ROLLS THINKING YOUR GETTING A DEAL.  Ive had bogo sushi in other areas but this is repulsive.  This sushi you can find at a buffet or a grocery store.  To other foodies who are trying this place for their 1st time.......skip it.  You can go to a buffet and get the same quality for half the price.  Even for bogo, their sizes for the rolls are smaller than what you will pay for  at another sushi spot for the same price.   Save the trouble and go somewhere else if you want to go here go to a chinese buffet instead.  You'll thank me later"}
{"text":"Ordered a rice/vegetable dish and it was pretty much all onions and barely any veggies. My boyfriend got sick from the sushi he had. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends craving sushi...we each ordered two rolls, since they are BOGO1/2.  I ordered the Surf and Turf roll and Spiral Ecstacy.  Both were delicious.  A friend got the Charlotte Roll, which while messy was tasty (much like a good crab salad on top).  Favorite of the table was the Furious Dragon--which had just enough of a kick to be spicy and good, but not tooooo hot.  16 pieces  I've had bad sushi before, and this was definitely not it.  Sushi tasted fresh, was tasty and artfully created.  Will be back."}
{"text":"A consistently good place. I eat here at 2-3 times a month for several years now. Like most restaurants they may have an \"off\" night on occasion.  I'm a big fan of there sushi, pho and several Korean dishes."}
{"text":"After four visits, I'm still not sure how to feel about Akahana.  The portions are generous, the drink specials tend to be good, and the sushi is very solid.  The service is less awesome, and the chef is kind of a [euphemism].  Does this add up to a 3?  Let's see:  The menu seems to be around 55 pages long.  Maybe not 55 pages, but it's a tome.  There are a wide variety of southeast-asian dishes; some you're familiar with, some you likely aren't.  Everything I've had has been solid but not exemplary, nothing's been bad, and I've never sent anything back.  (Except for a bottle of sake once -- it had gone south, it was awful, and I really don't want to think about it.)  The sushi's quality is good, but not as good as can be had elsewhere for the appropriate premium.  I'd say it's fairly priced, maybe even a little cheap if you count the buy-one get-one-free sushi roll nights (Tuesday and Thursdays, limited selection of rolls).  Some of the rolls are creative, some standard.  The spicy tuna is, as advertised, spicy.  The atmosphere seems to be aiming for somewhere this side of a dance club.  Given some of the upright glass and the half-height dividers, it's perfect for a John Wu-style gun-fu shootout, especially with their typical music selection, which the kids might refer to as 'phat beats'.  I'm not sure whether this is a plus or a minus.  It's not a place where you're going to have a serious conversation.  The service is, as mentioned above, less than stellar.  Often inattentive, obviously disinterested, not guaranteed to have heard what you ordered, but definitely not stressed about remembering it.  Plentiful parking, and next to an incredibly well-supplied collection of wallet-draining used books.  Easy to get in and out of.  Summary: Good food but not fantastic, iffy service, John Wu.  3."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a review on the food. However, the hostess was completely rude and didn't even seat me. She just motioned for me to go sit somewhere. It took waaay too long to get a menu considering I was the only person there. No one ever even came to get my drink order. The music selection was decent, but it's pathetic that I actually sat there and listened for so long without so much as a drink in front of me."}
{"text":"1) BOGO: what a gimmick.  Their rolls are about half a roll from most other restaurants, so you're paying $14 for 2 mediocre halves.  2) AVAILABILITY: Tried to order some a la carte nigiri and sashimi.  Pretty much everything I tried to order was unavailable and has been \"for MONTHS\" (per our server).  Uh... then maybe don't have it on your menu.  Then the waitress said the restaurant doesn't order it because they don't make money on it.  Uhhhh... then maybe raise the price? I think people who want uni or toro will understand that it will cost more.  3) VARIETY: Sure, variety is the spice of life, but I don't trust an Asian restaurant that serves multiple different Asian cuisines.  I only tried the sushi so maybe the pho, thai curries/noodles, udon, and teppanyaki is really good... but dubious.  4) SERVICE: Our server was adorable and nice, but she was not good at her job.  Her timing was so bad it was comical and it provided us with entertainment.  E.g., she would only come to take food/drink orders when one of us was in the bathroom.  Also, she never blinked.   TL; DR -- Wholly unimpressive; BOGO is a gimmick; service is bad."}
{"text":"I work a few blocks away and I'm kinda obsessed with their Beef Fried Rice. I wish it came w/ veggies but I just add Broccoli. Fair price for the amount (I have some for lunch and the rest for dinner #BacheloretteLife lol).  The sushi is BOGO everyday for a reason. I'm no sushi connoisseur but I think it's pretty mediocre. The shrimp sauce is even worse. 3 words... Too. Much. Mayo."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but food wait time was a bit lengthy. Dragon roll wasn't complete. Salmon dish with the coconut sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last week.  I am very picky about my Asian food and this place did not win my praise.  My family ordered Bun. I had yellow chicken cari. (curry).  The sushi was BOGOF.  The curry could use more spice, not heat.  I like a lot of flavor when I cook.  I also like my chicken cooked more well done than I usually find at Asian restaurants.  The sushi was a little dry (i.e. the rice).  I was also disappointed that they wanted to charge me $1 for a bowl of jasmine rice to go with my left over curry."}
{"text":"Est at this place quite often, but just now getting around to write a review.  I mainly get sushi when I go here, but have tried regular menu items a couple times.  The sushi is fantastic and at a great price (buy 1 get 1 Rolls everyday of the week)!!  The other menu items that I've tried have been good as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"For a quick and quality, easy sushi night... This is it. No big production. Grab a $1 PBR and 1 for 2 rolls. I've had them all by now and have no complains. Better than Russans, but falls short of Pisces. Long way to Nikkos."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I decided to opt out of takeout and actually dine in for once. Big mistake. I always get to-go food here and it's consistently fair to middling. The same or less can be said for my food tonight, I had the lotus roll which has spicy tuna inside among other ingredients, but there was no spice at all. Pretty flavorless on the whole. But, the thing that really put me off of this place was the service. It was 845 pm, just got out of yoga and needed food and possibly a drink... Head to the bar where I'm greeted with a super unfriendly bartender who- right off the bat, instead of hello, I get a bristly l \"do you need a drink menu?\"... Maybe she had been having a bad day? She was somewhat helpful selecting the sake I ordered. She was on her phone/computer the whole time, didn't smile once and honestly made me slightly uncomfortable, I felt as if I was a burden. I definitely won't be back to dine in."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Akahana for dine in and carry out for the past two years and it never disappoints! The sushi is fresh and tasty, and the other things I have tried have been good too. Lots of options for sushi, and their soup portions are tasty and huge! The BOGO sushi specials are always great too! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Nice atmosphere, good service, and the sushi was delicious (I liked the Furious Dragon Roll). We got the spicy edamame as an appetizer and it was yummy - it wasn't overly spicy. Also - the sushi is BUY ONE ROLL GET ONE FREE!?? ALL THE TIME!??? I was surprised at how affordable it was considering the atmosphere. They have a lot of local beers on tap too - Birdsong, NoDa, etc. The parking lot is tough though - although it's across the street from some street parking & a Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for the first time with another couple.  Big Pro: BOGO sushi all the time!!  For a Saturday night, this place was pretty dead. My friend and I ordered the drink special for the day, orange creamsicle while the boys ordered beers (they seemed to have a handful of local beers available). Unfortunately, the Orance Creamsicle was a major letdown. Neither one of us liked it at all.....it tasted like some type of medicine!!  We started off with a spring roll each and an order of the crap wontons. Not a big fan of the crab wontons, maybe a bit to much creamcheese and not enough crab! The spring rolls were pretty good though.   We ordered 8 rolls for the 4 of us: a few Bagel rolls, a San Francisco Roll, a cruncy tuna roll, and a few others. They came out on this huge boat which was alot of fun. Someone sitting beside us actually asked to take a picture cause the boat was that cool!  Unfortunately, none of the rolls were that amazing. I mean, the San Francsico roll was by far the best. I loved that lemon on top. Such a light and refreshing roll. The rest were just ok. Not amazing. But not poor either. I don't feel like I have super snobby sushi tastes. Just wasnt a fan of Akahana.....maybe a bit too bland for my taste!"}
{"text":"Cool spot to have a meal and a drink.  Nice BOGO sushi menu with good rolls. Staff typically provides good service."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place out after hearing both good and not so good reviews from locals in the 'hood. First things first, we went on a Monday night, at 7 o'clock and the electronic/techno music was so very loud that we sat at the table closest to the door in hopes it would be somewhat muted. Not so much. They even turned it up at one point and we were literally two out of, oh, five customers in the joint. There was no dance party goin' on. Seemed to me like they were trying to take a page out of Nikko's book, but there is a reason (actually, several) that I avoid that place at all costs. I like to be able to hear my husband talk and not watch him wince as he tries to eat sushi while his head throbs with pulsing bass. Our service was average, and since business was slow, we got lots and lots of walk-bys from the rest of the waitstaff and managers. Hovering is the best way I can describe it. I am a server myself, so I get the sometimes uncontrollable desire to harass your tables with attention when it's slow, but this kinda felt more like they were watching to see if we were going to steal the chopsticks.  On to the food. We shared two sushi rolls, the standard Dragon and Caterpillar. He likes eel, I like soft shell crab, so it's the usual for us. Both were decent and nicely presented, no complaints. We also had shrimp, pineapple, and cashew fried rice and the portion size was huge. Definitely enough to share, although hubby would have gladly put it down by himself I think. This was, of course, after we both added a generous amount of Siracha, as the dish was pretty much bland without it. It was listed as a \"Thai\" dish on the menu, so I think we both expected some heat, but it was missing. The rice and shrimp, however, were both perfectly cooked. A little bit of regional cuisine confusion on the giant menu was the downfall here, I think.  We both had bellinis that were on special and they were pretty lackluster. The drink specials catered more to the party crowd (like the music) with stuff like sake bombs and red bull and vodka being featured instead of more dinner-friendly options like wine or beer.  For the record, my review is 2.5 stars. I want to like this place and will go back to try some other things....just probably from the take-out menu this time."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are buy one get on half off every night.   The quality is consistently good, and they have excellent miso soup.   The hot entrees look fantastic, but I have not tried any of them yet.   They frequently have drink specials, so we frequent this spot quite often as it's in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"My husband and I really love this place. We've only had the sushi, so I can't speak for the whole menu, but we've been very pleased every time. The prices are good, and the BOGO deal is pretty great! It's definitely a place we will return to time and time again."}
{"text":"First of al the buy one one, get one half off isn't as sweet as if sounds. Most of their rolls priced on the higher end, especially considering. But hey if the sushi is worth it I'll pay. That was not the case with this place. We started our meal with spring rolls. They were what was typically expected, except the shrimp wasn't deveined..yuck! After that we order two rolls. I got the crunchy tuna roll. I did enjoy that they put panko it, so I was able to get the crunch without it being fried. It was topped with avocado, which wasn't very fresh. It's certainly not something I'd order again. The service was friendly and fast. Although I didn't enjoy their sushi, I wouldn't be opposed to trying some of their other cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. I love the BOGO sushi deal and the spicy edamame. However, on my last visit I ordered hot green tea. When the bartender brought it to me, it was green tea from Costco. Sitting at the bar, you see people from the kitchen bringing food from the kitchen to the sushi bar. None of the employees were wearing gloves and touching the food with their hands. After seeing that they serve Costco tea, it makes me question the quality of their sushi."}
{"text":"Naturally, the first thing I do when trying out a new place is check out the reviews on Yelp and when I checked it out for Akahana, many people mentioned how bad the service was. I wanted to be the one who proved them wrong, the one to show everyone that Akahana would be my new, wonderful go to spot with terrific service but I'm sad to report I'm not that person.   I don't know if it was because they are newer and are drawing in quite a crowd on Thursday nights and the servers are overwhelmed but the service was almost non existent. We practically had to flag down our waitress to give her our order, get refills, etc. and I contemplated throwing a chopstick at our server to get her attention but with my luck, that would've either a) turn into a lawsuit or b) get violently ill from sushi gone wrong.    On the flip side, $17 for two rolls, a salad and a beer is A-Ok in my book. The sushi? Holy wonderful, fresh, yummyness batman! I was surprised by how fresh it was and how much flavor it had packed in the rolls. Some mentioned that the rolls on BOGO nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays) were smaller but I felt they were appropriate sized pieces for what they are charging (I can't remember the names exactly but got the Furious Dragon and Sweet Romeo roll). The downside about BOGO nights is that there isn't any vegetarian options on the BOGO menu and it says no substitutions on the menu.   The vibe was good-very vibrant with orange walls, moderate volume music and packed. They have a moderate sized bar area complete with the regular stuff you would expect-ESPN, Japanese beers and specials galore.   I will be back to check out Akahana.....but only when I have nothing planned afterwards so I won't mind waiting so long for my sush."}
{"text":"First things first: BOGO on entire sushi menu ALL DAY EVERY DAY! If you need a sushi fix and don't feel like dropping over $30 for two rolls...welcome to heaven.   It's not the worst sushi you'll ever have but its not the best.   Atmosphere is a solid B but a few other upsides are that they have a parking lot, never a long wait, service is quick and fairly large sushi menu."}
{"text":"The owner is so friendly and who doesn't love buy one and get one sushi! Never has a problem with serves. But tbh food in general is decent but not worth the price and for some reason no matter what dish I get it tastes sweet like they garnish they food with sugar on every dish. But everything else is wonderful! Love their sushi and appetizers."}
{"text":"They were very friendly and had awesome specials. I would go with anything lemon grass. The only thing I wasn't impressed with is their BoGo sale (By one get one) What they do is just jack up the price of a regular Cali roll to 14.00 to equal out to the fancier rolls. Still a good spot and plus they have outside seating which is nice."}
{"text":"FYI to everyone..BOGO is EVERY nite now..don't know if thats a good thing or a harbinger of trying to get more business 'cause they're struggling.  This is REALLY a 3.5 star review (why can't YELP get software to let u do 1/2 stars?). Have eaten there many times, and all the sushi/sashimi I've eaten there has been really good..soups too....and I'm a big guy (6'2\" 275) and I don't know where the complaints about small portions comes from; i can order 2 rolls and a bowl of miso soup and be full. Plus they run GREAT cheap drink specials on beer and liquor drinks (a $3 Yukon Jack drink in a regular glass thats a good stiff drink..C'Mon, thats killer!!) As far as service I've never had BAD service, most of the time is decent to pretty good, they're always really friendly, and as far as helpful, itsa daily BOGO menu; the ingredients are on the menu and how its fixed; thrift a litlte CAY-ASH and go out on a limb and try something new, if u don't like it you've haven't spent much money.  I DO agree the \"Night @ the Roxbury\" club trash music thumping in there at 7PM is a LEEEEETLE much...maybe after 10pm guys????"}
{"text":"Definitely one if my favorite sushi spots. I'm from Cali, and I'm always afraid of trying sushi in different states but I have to admit that the hurricane roll is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi here and a great deal for diners--buy one roll get one free. We have tried the orange blossom roll, crunchy tuna, sunflower and dragon rolls and liked the flavors of them all and the fresh nigiri and sashimi. They are a tiny place in the plaza Midwood area but the sushi is consistently delicious. They have good drink specials too. Servers are always friendly so stop by and get on a roll!"}
{"text":"Well!! Little do I remember !  I wrote a review almost 3 years ago on this place... I remember NOT liking it there at akahana.  SOMEHOW  my friends encouraged me to try it one more time- FAIL.  The BOGO enticed me, let me tell ya, if those sushi rolls weren't bogo- I wouldve been soooo pissed off.  Its bogo for a reason folks.  The sushi is awful. Not much different from what I was claiming in 2012.  I tried the cherry blossom roll and the surf n turf. YUCK. My other 2 friends that were with me agreed that their rolls tasted old, just as mine did. My sushi had avocado where some of it was turning in color (old) and the salmon also did not look fresh....or the tuna.... DAMN!  Like seriously guys, sushi isnt your cup of tea.... practically 3 years later....STILL, simply put, AWFUL sushi.  I will never go back, I dont care what kind of luring special they advertise, on top of it all - believe it or not this place is pricey!  Like 14 bucks for something you wouldnt pay a dollar for.  Rusans, in my opinion,  can't be beat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The selection of unique rolls is really what keeps me coming here. The crab wontons start off your meal perfectly,  because let's face it, how can those get messed up? On my most recent visit today, the trend of terribly lazy service continued. I was one of three total tables in the restaurant and was still getting no attention from our waitress. Ive put enough time in working at restaurants to know that serving sunday mornings at a sushi place is a walk in the park. We ordered a cali n spicy tuna to start, but we received a salmon and tuna roll instead. When the server returns with our \"correct\" order they merely squirted a bunch of sriracha sauce on the tuna roll to make it \"spicy tuna.\" How lazy. Beverages were empty often and had to call out a mistake on the check of charging for an extra roll. I used to love this place since it was so close and convenient, but now the service is so consistantly bad I'm not sure if I will be going back."}
{"text":"The Florida Roll & Watermelon Roll were delicious!! Cant go wrong with BOGO speciality sushi!"}
{"text":"I heard great things and was glad we tried it out my son wanted to come back before we even got our food based on the attentiveness of our waiter. The pho and sushi was great. The Bellini was not too shabby either."}
{"text":"The service was good, but that was about it.  I wanted something asian for lunch and was on my way to the wonderful dim sum place down central when I saw BOGO sushi.  So, I stopped and went in.  The fish at the sushi bar looked good, so I decided to eat there.  The ambiance felt like it was recently something else and they just painted over it and added a fountain.  It took a second for me to be seated, but my waitress was quite responsive.  I opened the sushi menu to see that most of the rolls were about twice the price they should be(at least for this side of town), so this BOGO was really \"you have to buy twice as much to get it for the normal price.\"  I tried to order some hand rolls, but they said that wasn't included in BOGO.  So, then I tried to order some nigiri, that wasn't included either.  I asked, why does it say BOGO sushi, and the waitress told me sushi meant rolls.  I quickly corrected her and stated that no, sushi means rice.  I probably shouldn't have done that, but I don't like misinformation.  I was feeling kind of cheap but was really hungry so I went with the hibachi chicken.  There were many other options, and I guess I chose the worst.  First I got my salad, nothing special, but not bad.  Then came my food, a nice sized plate of food.  Little bits of chicken and such with a nice sized order of rice.  Oh, it was so dry, I really didn't enjoy it at all.  I guess I should have gone with the over-priced sushi, but I doubt I will return to find out.  Sorry guys, there are sooooo many sushi places in town these days, gotta get me on the first impression."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this a solid 4 because of the economical nature of it.  It is in no way high class sushi.  But, it's honestly better, in my opinion, than many of the other expensive sushi places in Charlotte.  Get the simple menu if they offer if you're like me and don't want cream cheese in you're f***king sushi.  If you do that, with their everyday bogo, it boils down to like $4.50 a roll."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Akahana and I won't be back. There were about 9 tables (including people sitting at the bar)  total in the restaurant and only ONE server. She could hardly keep up. There were dirty tables and spots at the bar everywhere because tables weren't being cleaned quickly enough.   Other customers were looking around as I was almost seeming to wonder \"Where is our food?!\" Our edamame appetizer sat in the kitchen window for 5 minutes before being brought to us. I know this because I saw it sitting there.   Our 2 sushi rolls (not fried) took about 35 minutes to be prepared and served to us. I noticed there was only 1 sushi chef. I'm not sure if that's typical for a holiday day lunch shift but it probably shouldn't be. The younger gentleman sitting at a table behind us sent back his sushi roll because \"the crab tasted funny\". Not a good sign.... We almost walked out before getting our sushi rolls but felt bad so we stayed. The rolls were nothing to write home about. In hindsight, I wished we had gone somewhere else instead. We could have eaten almost anywhere nearby for a quicker, cheaper, tastier lunch.   They do offer Buy One Get One sushi rolls. Our check with 2 rolls and edamame and a soft drink was $24. It would have easily been at least $35 if we had paid full price. Thank God we didn't."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday evening when my hunger was at its prime. I ordered some sushi. After a single piece I knew something was wrong. It was just not fresh especially the rice. I felt like throwing up so I stopped eating and drank the beer I had ordered instead. After a while I though I had second guessing myself and tried another piece. It was the same bad stale taste. I stopped eating. I think I had two pieces out of the 10 or so on the plate. I lost my appetite altogether. BUT, the  worst was when the waitress came by to hand us the check. She asked me if I needed a box for the remaining sushi. I actually said in an almost apologetic tone  \"mm.. sorry I actually didn't like them at all. I couldn't eat them\".  She looked at me without any expression and nodded and said \"Okay\" and went away.   The LEAST I expected was for her to ask me what was wrong with the sushi. I would have told her gladly. Anyway, I will not go there again because this restaurants sucks.   The Akahana at Baxter village is much better. A better crowd comes there and they are much nicer to you. I think it's a SC thing!  BOO AKAHANA. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"I love this place..Food never disappoints. However i usually call 4-5 times and get a busy signal. Therefore i haven't been in a while..You guys should update your phone service to include a call waiting. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love me some Akahana. My girlfriend and I carry out at least weekly-- BOGO rolls 7 days/week!  Their bartenders are very knowledgeable when it comes to sake and let us sample anything we're considering.   The ideal meal looks like this: spicy edamame and hot sour soup to start; furious dragon roll and usually one of their seasonal/special rolls. When we're dining with friends and feeling festive we may get a paired beer/sake \"bomb\". The white zombie one is a crowd pleaser.   I'm always very full and have never made it to dessert. Akahana is a must-try!"}
{"text":"When you want sushi in a hurry Akahana is the place!  I have been here a few times and always had positive experiences.  They have a wide variety of rolls and it is buy one get on free.  I have never had to wait for a table and the service is pretty efficient.  I will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Went the first time and got the fried oyster and the shrimp tempura sushi! It's was buy one get one free and also delicious!!!!! Came back today and tried the Sesame chicken with my boyfriend! We LOVED it! Can't wait to come back ( which may be tomorrow) haha!"}
{"text":"Akahana has a very trendy interior. The lights are dimmed and there's a blue tone that circulates the restaurant. The only issue I have with this ambiance is when I come for lunch. The entire restaurant seems too dim compared to Mr. Sun shinning oh so brightly outside lol Of course you can always choose the outside seating, which is nice during a cool afternoon.  This is the typical fusion restaurant with a very extensive menu. They have Vietnamese, Thai and Sushi. I just don't expect a restaurant with a broad menu to have amazing \"omg, I have to live here\" food (which is my normal reaction to a restaurant I love :P), but Akahana is decent. It's a good place to go when you're indecisive or if you have a large crowd with different tastes.I've tried all three cuisines here and the Vietnamese dishes are my favorite.  Reviews for all three cuisines:  The Vietnamese dishes are very affordable. I believe all dishes are $10 and under. The pho is pretty good, but it varies. From experience, it is really good on Wednesdays lol I'm not really sure why. The Pork Chop Rice Platter is my go-to plate since it has never let me down! It comes with grilled pork chop, an egg, rice and vegetables. Very delicious and filling! I would also recommend the \"Vietnamese Shaking Beef (Bo Luc Lac)\" and \"Seafood Crispy Egg Noodle (Mi Xao Don)\" I think most people will be overwhelmed by the Seafood Crispy Egg Noodle. It is a stir fry over a bed of fried noodles. It is HUGE and looks like a bird's nest lol   The Thai dishes are also affordable, about $10 and under as well. I've only tried the Pad Thai and I wouldn't really recommend it. The flavor is decent, but the noodles are never done correctly. They fall apart with every bite.  SUSHI! The sushi rolls are generally more expensive than other places (prices comparable to Cowfish, but not as yummy). Though the sushi is BOGO so it's decent. My favorite is the Spiral Ecstasy Roll! It comes with three different types of fish and avocado! :D The Tropical Exotic Roll is interesting. It's a sushi dish but it comes in triangles. I didn't really care for it (the presentation or the taste), but my friend thought it was unique.  Overall: decent food, affordable prices, trendy atmosphere, but nothing out of this world amazing"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with their buy one, get one free special that they run EVERYDAY. Nowhere in CLT does that. Their Golden Gate and Hurricane Rolls are two of my favorites and they also have pretty good drink specials like $5 glasses of sangria on saturdays so definitely go check them out!"}
{"text":"BOGO yay! I've only stopped in for lunch - BOGO for lunch is a good deal well it's a good deal for dinner too  -but it's almost too much food for lunch.  The menu is huge and there are plenty of rolls to choose from for BOGO.  My rolls we're delicious - it's a little pricey but I was really pleased with all the options on the menu and the ambiance was awesome."}
{"text":"Where Akahana isn't an incredible location based on locale, they definitely pack a punch with a sushi menu of note. Checked these guys out for lunch after a long awaited and needed visit.   The decor is actually pretty swanky. I really like the waterfall with the glass logo behind it. Pretty snazzy. Cool bar setup, too.   We ordered a ton of sashimi and a few basic rolls. Check out my photo from the sashimi/nigiri platter. Gorgeous presentation. Fresh, flavorful and service was very fast and direct from the chef over the counter.   My biggest dislikes are the prices and the TVs. Prices do seen a little steep, but for the amount of food we ordered, it was well worth it. Can't say the same if it weren't for the buy one, get one half off deal. Probably wouldn't go back if it weren't around. And the TVs. Just yuck. Jerry springer and other garbage channels on all of them and the sushi chefs were glued to it. Kind of funny, but really disappointing. Daytime TV + sushi = no thanks.   I can say I'd be back, but maybe for a change from the regular sushi go-tos. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I like Akahana.  My husband always takes advantage of the BOGO rolls and I always get a nigiri plate (which comes with soup and salad).  I've also had curry here before and enjoyed it.  My only issue is that the service sometimes isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Y'all we went back and tried the sushi a bit more extensively. I have to say that if you are looking for a good fresh sushi experience, you are in the right place.  Their maki come with 8 pieces so I highly recommend mixing in some of their under $5 2-piece nigiri selections (smelt or flying fish roe, what what!). They are fond of adding tempura and avacado to things which cut the menu down for me, but there were still plenty of selections and they were tasty as can be.  Oh, and I wanted to hug our server. She was just the cheeriest girl I ever did meet."}
{"text":"My husband & I both live in Plaza Midwood and have been wanting a restaurant like this to show up for so long!!  We have been 3 times since they have opened.  While we have only had the sushi, it has always been very good.  The servers are very nice.  We would highly recommend this restaurant.  Very big menu ... even for those non sushi lovers.  I hope this place makes it as we will be back very soon!!  Please check out this restaurant and support Plaza Midwood!!"}
{"text":"We began with the pineapple drink, which was *sigh* served with the pineapple intact - drink was a little weak for 15 dollars.   We decided to share a sashimi boat with some sushi rice on the side.  They brought us our miso soup and salads, which were pretty good.  Unfortunately, we waited an additional 10 minutes for our sushi boat, which came on a plate and not an actual boat (of which, we saw many were available.  We examined the sashimi platter and everything seemed normal, until we got to the end, and there were...about...8 pieces of imitation crab.  My boyfriend and I looked at each other incredulously, thinking that, maybe we got the wrong platter.  After confirming with a waiter that this is indeed the sashimi boat that we ordered, the anger set in.  We could not believe the AUDACITY of serving imitation crab meat in a 40 dollar sashimi boat.  After confirming that this is a legitimate, we spoke to the waitress who ended up informing the manager of the situation.  The manager came and took away our plate and replaced the imitation crab with 4 pieces of octopus and a few additional salmon pieces.  Even with the replacement, the sashimi boat was not worth $40, since the actual fish sashimi pieces were sliced incredibly thin.  When we got the bill, we discovered that they charged $2.95 per bowl of rice.  Overall, we found this experience to be extremely underwhelming.  We would not recommend eating the sashimi at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Akahana. The menu is flavorful and creative. The drink list is extensive and impressive. The decor is hip and trendy. This is a great spot for girls night out or a nice date with someone special.   I ordered sushi for my main course and it was delicious! I would rank Akahana right up there with Ru Sans or Pisces. I will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the $14 Lotus Blossom and Orange Blossom sushi rolls with salmon and tuna but a few of the pieces were missing fish and they were tiny to begin with. Definitely NOT worth it and it took an hour to get them."}
{"text":"Great sushi. They give you a good portion and it's always buy one get one half off.  Cant beat that!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Akahana for my sushi since I moved to Charlotte a year ago. Im a picky eater and found rolls here that I love and get every time. The service is hit or miss and in the past year I've come here quite a few times and haven't been impressed with food to say the least. But for some reason, I continue to go back. I ordered some food Togo for the first time in over a month and was very impressed. The rolls were great and so was the fried rice. I hope they have gotten through their subpar phase because I love coming here and I love that's it's so close to home."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times over the past few years and only got sushi for their special. Went last night with some friends for a birthday and everyone else ordered things other than sushi. They all looked and tasted soooo good!! Sake-tinis were awesome! I must go back soon just to get something other than sushi.   Customer service was decent. Restaurant pretty clean. Quality of food was good and the low prices were excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night.  I had the massaman curry which was tasty but not served hot enough (temperature-wise).  We had a lovely waitress who was well-versed on the menu and, in general, I thought the service was great.    My main beef was with the menu.  Every combination and permutation of asian food is on here.  And that's not so good. When a restaurant has a menu this large, I immediately think it is not living up to its potential because it is spreading itself too thin.  It makes more sense to do a few things extremely well then a million things kind-of ok.  In an effort to please every possible restaurant-goer, the restaurant loses it's identity and does itself a disservice.  Is this a Thai place?  Sushi?  Chinese?  I have no idea.  I hope this place resolves its identity crisis and pares down the menu because I would love to see a restaurant (other than Subway) on this little corner of the Plaza succeed."}
{"text":"One of my fav sushi places by far. They always have BOGO sushi and good drink specials during the week. I've tried a couple of different sushi places and this one gives you more bang for your buck when it comes to chef specialty sushi rolls. I feel like every other place I've been too charges the same price for these rolls or more. The spring rolls are an amazing app to start with and next time I go I'm going to try the pineapple shrimp fried rice seems like a fan favorite. I took my friend for the first time and he loved it ordered 4 rolls compared to my 2. I would name some of the few rolls I've tried but there are so many. One of my favorites is the deep sea roll."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon a gem while on a weekend business trip. Ian, the manger was very friendly and welcoming. The bartender Dallas suggested the beef brisket pho and the seafood hot pot (so we listened) .... and it turned out to be BOMB! Customer service was super as well. We don't come to charlotte often; but when we do in the future, we will make sure to stop by this place again!"}
{"text":"Food was good, for the most part. Way too greasy and too much soy sauce tho. The waitress had a disturbed look. Too bad because you get tipped based on your attitude. Usually great place but she somewhat ruined the spirit. If you hate your job find a new one and quit. Logical I think?"}
{"text":"One spider roll with greasy limp crab and iceberg lettuce please.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Reliable, dependable, enjoyable.   Ian and the staff tend to deliver an entertaining and memorable dining experience.   Buy one, get one free sushi rolls every day. Inventive drinks, like the Pineapple Drink, local beers at reasonable prices (even though I don't drink them), and my favorite green curry in the neighborhood.   Just drinking? Akahana will sell you drinks at the bar. Full bar with a 725- page alcohol menu."}
{"text":"It was in a strip mall and that's how it tasted. The sushi was dry and the plate was greasy and it looked like it was a used dish. The wasabi rolls had chunks of wasabi, which is not how it was described. The spicy tuna wasn't shredded and it just looked like raw beef. The vermicelli bowl was fine. The stir fried veggies were fine, but much more expensive than the price advertised on the menu. The waitress took a long time because she was too busy talking to someone for a long time. The owner came by and asked how things were. We had to ask him for the check twice before he finally did it.   1 star; if I could give it 0 I would."}
{"text":"Great value. Not the absolute best sushi but very tasty and you get a lot for your money"}
{"text":"I'll never go back to akahana. The service was awful. One of my friends got the calamari.  It was undercooked so my friend called the manager. The manager actually argued with us about it. My drink was spilled accidentally. Usually places will give you another drink. Not Akahana. Took forever with our bills.  The sushi was mediocre."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Not only do they have the best spicy edamame... EVER, but they have any awesome sushi selection. Do not be deterred from this gem just because it is in a strip mall, Akahana is where it's at! Be sure to check out the vegetarian menu.. the Zen Roll is my favorite. They also have great craft beer on draft which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"BOGO sushi everyday which is the best deal. They have a lot of different speciality rolls. Some of the rolls can be a little small but its the best bang for your buck when it comes to sushi in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It honesty doesn't look like much from the outside, but I didn't expect it to look as it did on the inside.  BOGO sushi rolls was an awesome deal, and the ones I had were fresh and pretty good. I went during lunch so I can't speak for the dinner crowd but I'd definitely return or order takeout here."}
{"text":"Is this my favorite sushi place? No. Is it a great value for sushi? Yes. I visit Akahana mostly because it is walking distance to my house and they have Buy One, Get One Free rolls EVERY DAY. And this is why my boyfriend and I continue to frequent Akahana. That and their stellar drink specials. Their sushi is pretty good to just ok. We have finally got down pat the four rolls we like best- and order these every time. I can't wait to try the new pho they are now offering too."}
{"text":"$2 well drinks on Tuesdays and buy one get one free sushi rolls every day!  With those specials it is easy to eat there. Fair warning-I don't think it is the freshest food in town and last time I was there another patron had her phone stolen from her table when she visited the restroom."}
{"text":"So excited to find great sushi on this side of town. The soup and salad portions exceeded our expectations and the sushi was amazing. BOGO was too good to be true. Excellent staff and even the general manager stopped by to ensure our experience couldn't be any better. We will return soon."}
{"text":"it is difficult not to be a fan of akahana.  i mean, a BOGO sushi roll deal EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK?!  come on!  and these are hearty rolls, my friend.  fantastic flavors and super fresh ingredients.  and do i even need to mention that they have the plaza midwood staple of cheap PBR... on draft?    nestled into the corner at the corner of the plaza and central, it's a little dimly lit for my tastes.  the almost dingy hole in the wall feel doesn't really capture the vibrancy of their food.  i have only ever sat at the bar, which if everyone is eating and drinking can get to be a little too much for just one bartender.  service doesn't suffer much, but the refills don't come as quick.  a number of businesses have occupied this piece of real estate, but i think akahana is here to stay... hopefully."}
{"text":"I think most people go here for the convenience as it's located right in the heart of plaza midwood. Food is alright, service is okay. Nothing special. Although the buy one, get one sushi rolls is one of the better deals you'll find in the area."}
{"text":"the food's great... fresh veg, great, flavorful herbs, generous portions, good price. There's a nice outside dining area, the staff is very friendly and accommodating. The only downside, and it's a matter of taste versus an actual problem: Loud Techno music inside. Outside, the often have live music, which gives the place a really nice, comfortable feel. If you like asian food, this place is a must try. I believe you'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Akahana is a reliable option for sushi and takeout in Plaza Midwood. The BOGO sushi rolls everyday include an extensive list of options so you don't have to get the same ones each time. The BOGO is also offered for takeout. The Vietnamese bun is also pretty good and is of good size. The spicy edamame are excellent.   The service has historically been hit or miss but has been more reliable of late. There are drink specials most days, but they aren't always that enticing (like 15% off sake and $1 off beer).   The atmosphere is ok but occasionally it may smell like cleaner (really the only reason for not getting 5 stars). Will continue to eat here for (generally) good value sushi and Asian fare."}
{"text":"I Love Akahana! I think most people don't realize it exists because it is located in a small shopping center beside a little bookstore in Plaza Midwood, but if you've never been and love shush, this is the place to be. They always have buy one get one free specials, tasty drinks and tons of fun rolls to choose from."}
{"text":"Located in a dingy strip mall, it would be easy to overlook Akahana - but, you would be missing out on some very tasty food.  I eat here a couple of times a month and always enjoy my meal.  Akahana is most often reviewed for their BOGO sushi rolls, and while the sushi is fine - I prefer to dig in to the rest of their menu. There are a number of items on the main menu that really standout, including the Signature Pho served with thinly sliced steak served on the side to allow you to determine how long you want the steak to cook in the pho, the seafood hot pot with snapper, shrimp and scallops in a light oyster sauce, the red curry (I like it with the tofu), the spicy tuna/avocado bowl and the vietnamese crepe.    Pho tip - if you don't want a bowl full of noodles, you can ask them to sub veggies for the noodles for a couple dollar upcharge.  On those days I'm watching my carbs (they come and go), this is an excellent option!  For dining in, try to get a table on the right side of the restaurant (the bar side).  The left side of the restaurant has harsh fluorescent lighting and a completely different feel to it.    If you order takeout, be prepared to wait.  The orders often pile up and it can take a while for the host/hostess to sift through all of them.  Also, be sure to check your takeout order before leaving - as, sometimes special requests to the orders slip through the cracks."}
{"text":"So Akahana what's up? Do you hate me that much that you always pair me up with the very inattentive waiter that messes up my order every time?  Leanne C.'s review pretty much sums up our experience there. I got told I could have cake, then the cake was a lie, then there was cake again. Quit playing with my heart! I would've ordered some food to go with the cake if you hadn't taken almost an hour to bring it out of the freezer. My love of dessert for dinner is unrivaled, but this was really crappy cake that I ended up giving away because I couldn't stomach it's frozen sickly sweetness. I suggest that you inform people next time you're serving them cold chocolate cake because I kind of envisioned a warm fluffy moist piece of chocolate yumminess.  Service was awful, bad, below mediocre, crap, pick any negative adjective you like. Sake was ordered at the start of the meal and came out near the end after we had said we didn't want it anymore since it was so late, at least our server realized how big of a mess that was and comped us for it.  I hate the stupid BOGO deal, just price your stuff reasonably because I don't want to always eat 2 rolls when I come here. I think I'll have to end my relationship with you here for a while Akahana."}
{"text":"This is a great go to takeout sushi place for the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood. My husband and I order from here at least twice a month. We would probably eat here at least once a week, if they would answer the phone!   We have decided to order takeout on at least three occasions but couldn't because their number would be busy or would ring and ring with no answer. I just tried to call them 7 times. Half of the time the line was busy and the other half it just rang nonstop.   Guess we're not getting any maki tonight. :("}
{"text":"Good food and service. Large menu with good variety. Atmosphere is decent enough.(not bad at all)Only downfall would be that the prices are a hair bit high. If they lowered the prices say by a dollar or so and got some hip music, I think that would definately help. Also like the previous poster stated they also need something on the walls just to make it more homely. Anyway I would recomend it and I wish them the best of luck."}
{"text":"Hubs and I received a gift certificate to Akahana so we went the night before Valentine's Day for dinner. The place was nearly empty, which was nice for us to be seated. Our waitress was attentive and made recommendations for us.   When she brought us our soy sauce bowls and smaller plates for sharing, everything had a film on it or dried food left over. I didn't send it back, but we didn't use the small plates with food visible on them. Our sushi came out in a timely manner, but the quality was just okay. Their rolls are BOGO free which is a great deal, but they mark up their rolls for that reason. Again we ordered 4 rolls and only had to pay for 2, so that was nice.  They do have takeout and a lot of people were in and out getting orders to go. Maybe their non-sushi menu is more tasty than the sushi, but we probably wouldn't make a special trip to go back."}
{"text":"Decent sushi but a little overpriced for the quality and quantity even after the BOGO roll deal. The place isn't the cleanest either. It was a nice place To try but I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Akahana had won my heart when I found out they advertised buy one get one free sushi everyday - but then I took it back.  In theory, the BOGO deal seemed amazing but after a visit, I realized it was a big disappointment and honestly, pretty misleading.  The sushi rolls are nearly double the price I pay at other locations.  $12 for a typical roll with tuna, avocado, cucumber and a special sauce and it's is mediocre in size?  Yeah, I better be getting a second one!  The service was good and I thoroughly enjoyed the $2 martini specials.  The curbside appeal was bleh since it's located in a strip mall.  However, the interior is nice but not spectacular.  I don't have a reason to return in the future but it wasn't my worst sushi experience either."}
{"text":"I had a really great time on a date here. I was placed at a table with a nice view from the window where you could see the stop light of Central Ave and The Plaza. They have a cute and dark atmosphere going on in the evening time. I had the rainbow roll and the spiral ecstasy roll. The rainbow roll did not have the wide assortment of fish I was expecting, but it only seemed to have tuna, shrimp, salmon, and some other pale fish. All of it was delicious though. My review is missing one star because it was awfully muggy in the establishment and it was uncomfortable. Otherwise, the food, atmosphere, and staff was nice."}
{"text":"Many of my friends have raved about Akahana because (a) their sushi is ALWAYS bogo and (b) their sushi is delicous. After a lovely rainy stroll through McAdenville last night, my fiancé, a couple of friends, and I decided to test the waters.  Service: The service was great. We were seated immediately and our waiter was very attentive throughout the evening. Only issue was that it did take quite a while to get the food out.  Selection: I am not sure I have ever been anywhere that had such a great selection of sushi. They even had some Christmas specials. Everyone got two rolls (because bogo) and no one's rolls overlapped.  Food: Damn. I'm going back tonight. First, my rolls were huge. Six pieces each, but definitely bigger than most rolls I've had at different sushi establishments. I had the Maui Wowee roll (I was on a plane to Hawaii a year ago today) and the Snapdragon roll. EAch was awesome in its own way. the Maui Wowee had some jalapeno pieces in there, so it was a fair spice, and the Snapdragon was topped with mango, so a good balance to the jalapeno. No one at the table had ANY complaints.  Price: Akahana is a little more expensive that most sushi places, but where else is there always bogo rolls? well worth it.  Like I said, will definitely be revisiting Akahana sooner rather than later. They also offer carry-out if you just want to swing by after work."}
{"text":"Got the pho and it was much better than I expected. Tons of flavor and would definitely get it again. The bogo sushi is always a winner but glad to have success with something new."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi in Charlotte! Not only do they have creative rolls, but they are buy one get one FREE. They also have spicy edamame that is to die for. The staff is also wonderful. The manager is such a friendly man who truly cares that his customers have a great experience. Go get sushi here!"}
{"text":"Given that I live within walking distance and sushi is my new favorite past time, it all works out.  However there are a few things to take note of:  #1: I have eaten here on so many different occasions, both with friends and alone.  The customer service is VERY hit or miss.  It's never consistant.  They are either on track with the food, drinks and are 110% amazing at everything.  Or the food is mis-ordered, glasses sit empty, and one time my plate actually sat behind the counter for 5 minutes only to have another patron ask to take photos of my food (another 5 minutes) before it was served.    #2:  I love love LOVE the BOGO sushi, I always get the wasabi roll and depending on who's working the sushi bar depends on the amount of wasabi mayo they squirt all over it.  It's easy to scrap off, but come on!  Also, the tuna was alittle disturbing of a color.  I do love their specialty rolls though.  #3:  Great drink specials, and if they make an awful tasting drink (at least to your preference), they have remade for myself and friends, so props to the bartenders.  All in all, I frequent this place because it's very close and I love the location (grab a few rollls and parose the book store or library) and I'll keep going back"}
{"text":"This has been the worst sushi experience I have ever had. We arrived for an early dinner around 5:00 and we're seated in the dining room where there was just one additional party. We ordered soup and salad each, then two rolls (BOGO), and 6 pieces of nigiri (2 pieces each of salmon, tuna and white tuna. Soup and salad came out in about 10 minutes. It took over 45 minutes for our sushi to arrive. When it arrived there were two heaps of salmon roe rolled in seaweed as well was one tuna and one white tuna. We told the waiter we were supposed to have two pieces of each of tuna and that the salmon was supposed to be the nigiri salmon. We waited over 20 minutes for the correct salmon and additional two pieces of tuna. After the 20 minute mark passed I asked him to just cancel the order and bring the bill. That took almost 10 minutes and when he brought the bill we were charged for both rolls which are supposed to be BOGO and the salmon. If you're considering going here don't. This was my second time and the first they messed up but it was a busy Friday so I have them the benefit of the doubt.   Awful service. Subpar sushi. Just don't."}
{"text":"They have excellent Pho Dac Biet! But their keg was frozen so I could not get the beer special of the day and had to get a glass of Stella instead. Next time I'm in the area I will try their sushi.  ddc"}
{"text":"Yummy little Asian fusion joint in Plaza Midwood. We stopped in on a weekend afternoon around 1:30 and sat outside with our little chihuahua pup. (Extra points for the dog friendlyness!) I had the spicy basil dish with chicken and it was phenomenal, fresh and spicy with just enough sweet to balance. My grandma had the pineapple shrimp rice dish and it came served in half a fresh pineapple!!! So fun and delicious with hearty helping of shrimp. My mom got miso soup and two sushi rolls (buy one get one free!). All in all a cute place, good food and quick and friendly service! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times. The Charlotte Roll, Volcano Roll, Bagel Roll, and Spiral Extacy Roll are just some of my favorites. Their Pad Thai is amazing and my boyfriend always enjoys their Pho.   I usually get a draft PBR since they're only $1 but it's always ice cold. Some times they'll have $5 cocktails and I tried the Ginger Pear one and it was delightful.   We eat a lot and we're always surprised at how low our bill is when we leave so this is definitely one of our guilty pleasure spots with out feeling too guilty $$$."}
{"text":"Akahana...hmm. There's not really many positive things I can say about this place.  I was in the mood for sushi and saw on Yelp that they have a daily, BOGO deal on their sushi - even for take out orders - which sounded good to me.  They are located in a strip mall right across from the Plaza Harris Teeter. Based on the time of day, the parking lot can get tight and spots fill up quickly.  When I walked in, I was hit with a strong body odor aroma. Oddly it was only at the entrance. Once I walked inside, the stench was gone. At the hostess desk, I placed my order for two rolls: the Florida and furious dragon rolls. My total for both came to $16 and change. While I waited, I noticed how unkempt they keep the restaurant. Everything needs to be renovated.  The hostess brought me my food and once I got home, I was pretty disappointed that avocado pieces on my furious dragon roll were already turning brown. The sushi rolls tasted no better than what can be found in the sushi section of the Harris Teeter across the street."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11pm, sat at the sushi bar, not busy, all sushi is pre cut into paper thin pieces in the cooler.  At least we know the bacteria is on ALL the sushi and not just the ends.  I asked the sushi chef if he had any special rolls with eel sauce and tuna.  He recommended the cherry blossom roll.  The roll came out fast, had salmon and avocado in it and paper thin tuna on top with ZERO eel sauce.  The avocado was brown... not fresh.  This is not an upscale restaurant contrary to the description given on google maps.  Friendly service, quick service, over priced not fresh food."}
{"text":"The main selling point of Akahana is the every day BOGO sushi roll selection. Mind you, the sushi rolls they've come up with are not especially creative and I find that far too many of them have fillers like cream cheese that I'm just not looking for. (If I wanted shmear on my salmon, I'd have a bagel.) But it does have some redeeming qualities. The menu is very very long but you can pretty much skip the whole middle section because, although they list many Vietnamese options, these are not their forte. You'd do better to go down the street to one of the many Pho restaurants in Plaza or Eastland.   There are a few of the sushi rolls which I do like a lot, but I find it difficult to find multiple I really want each time. The seaweed salad is delicious, and the in-restaurant serving is generous, but the take-out serving (although the same exact price) always leaves me wishing I hadn't paid for it.   I'd say the most economical thing to order at Akahana is by far the soup. They're very reasonably priced (I love the egg drop and my husband always goes for the wonton) and they come in HUGE bowls, perfect for warming you up on a chilly day.   Dogs are allowed on the patio outside as long as they are on leash and behave themselves."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch, came especially for the BOGO sushi roll deal which is awesome btw!! Ordered one of their vegetarian roll. (it was the one with the tofu skin forgot the name oops!) Pretty good! My mom had the posideon roll & IT LOOKED SO BOMB! She said it was really good, better than the place we usually go to(Yama). Atmosphere was nice, service was supper slow though. They had like 2 workers but our waitress was nice. Overall I would come back since it's BOGO which is a super duper awesome deal, and deff plan on trying their other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their spring rolls and their BOGO sushi rolls! Our waitress was amazing even when we came close to closing time. Our food was fresh and exactly what i wanted. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Buy one roll, get one free. Then you don't even have to feel guilty about devouring two rolls in one sitting. The owner/manager makes some pretty comical dad jokes too!"}
{"text":"Short and Sweet:  Customer Service is so-so. It could be better. But they're mostly busy when I go here. The sushi is awesome. The menu is huge. There is also plenty for non-sushi people. It's on the pricey side for being in Plaza-Midwood. It's a little more expensive than Jade on some rolls.  Basically: If you don't care too much about paying for good sushi and don't get your feelings hurt on customer service."}
{"text":"Yeah BOGO great but had BETTER be BOGO with those small sushi rolls for that price!! Nice, cute, man-bun waiter."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I will mention that I have worked in the restaurant business for years and I am going to be polite but firmly honest.   We came because a friend liked their BOGO special. But, apparently this place is popular just because of the location and prices.   We will never be coming back. We didn't even stay to eat. Service was so slow and sanitation was so bad that we left (something we have never done). The table next to us ordered after us but were served multiple items before we even got our beers (which took forever). We put cash on the table for our two beers and then left because our waiter never came back. After leaving, we went to our usual, go-to sushi place.   I would dismiss these issues as being the innocence of a rookie server, but the sanitation was also a problem. The tables and bathroom were gross and there was trash all over the men's bathroom because nobody had tended to it in a long time.   This is not the place where I want to eat raw fish. Again, I'm trying my best to be polite here, but this experience was exceptionally bad."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian who loves sushi, it's been difficult for me to find a sushi joint that makes flavor-diverse sushi that I can eat. I am usually forced to stick with some sort of cucumber-avocado-carrot combo. Meh.  I regularly take my vegetarian friends to Akahana for sushi because they actually make their veggie sushi rolls worth eating! My favorites are the Green Day Roll (crunchy friend asparagus, cream cheese, and spicy mayo) and the Happy Buddha Roll (marinated fried tofu, cream cheese, avocado and \"eel\" sauce). The presentation is always fabulous and the service is on-point.  I've also had their Asian Summer Roll, a thai-inspired vegetarian roll served with a tasty peanut sauce, and their Miso Soup and House Salad. Their noodle and rice dishes are well-portioned and can definitely be split for two.  I will say, however, that I miss the buy-one-get-one-free sushi deals that Akahana had when they first opened. I understand that it was probably not the most cost-effective for them, but it was certainly great on my wallet!"}
{"text":"Sushi is solid, but I really love this place for the friendly service and excellent owner."}
{"text":"Wish I could do 2 and a half stars.....Went here for Thursday bogo night (yes it is only specific rolls and of those there are no vegetarian options????  WTF???).  But what I had was on the low-end of 'fine'.  The salmon when it came out in one of the rolls was room-temperature.  Hmmm....I had never experienced that before.  Not super appealing.  The rest was 'just fine' especially for those prices.    I liked the 'green' chopsticks - instead of the throw-aways they had plastic ones that were heftier.  Great job on that guys!    The bar service was better than the table service.  Try not to come at peak hours on bogo night and I am sure the service would be better.    There have been many establishments in this location and this is by far the best one.  I hope you stick around Akahana!!!  :-D"}
{"text":"Not bad. But not great. Buy one get one free sushi would be the only reason I would go. Service is suspect too"}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the area and eat here frequently. The service is always quick and the servers are genuinely interested in helping you enjoy the experience. In fact, the owner is almost always there going around and checking on things. Oh yes, and the sushi is fantastic and consistent. It's the perfect place for a casual night out, large groups, or a date."}
{"text":"I like Akahana because it's not pretentious, but still makes an attempt at being.. well something. It's not nice enough for a special occasion, despite the candles on the table. It's not a hip place to hang out, despite the dim lighting and Justin Timberlake booming over the PA system.    The food is consistently fine.. I'm never disappointed, but never blown away.   But.. you can't beat the BOGO deal. Sure, a house special Roll will set you back $15, but then you get another free and that's a cheap date or lunch for tomorrow or a late night snack after the bar.  Akahana is great for a weekday dinner or takeout after a hectic day at the office... Hang out at the fully stocked bar while you wait and enjoy the Timberlake."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for one day and our friend told us about the BOGO rolls. The rolls come out to be the same price as other restaurants because they are small maki rolls. We eat sushi in every town we visit, and this one did not blow us away. We like to revisit places we love, but we will look for a different sushi next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Akahana. The sushi is really great quality and tasty especially with the great prices they offer. It's my go to place when I want sushi. It's one of those hidden gems in my opinion."}
{"text":"We have always been pleased with our service and food from Akahana. The menu is a little overwhelming with so many delicious options, but the Pho and sushi are really delicious!! (however, beware that their jalapenos are HOT!) We always sit in the bar area, so I think its ideal for a casual, weekend late lunch or girls get together before going out. Not exactly my idea of a romantic date spot; however, I haven't been there during dinner rush so I could be very wrong.  I will be returning though! Thanks for great food and great service guys!"}
{"text":"this is our last visit to Akahana after years of visits. the one thing on the menu that I always get. ALWAYS was awful, had our waitress bothered to come back to our table I would have sent it back, but she didn't. Even after passing our table 3 times.  Had to ask the hostess for our check. will not be returning"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Akahana 8-10 times. I love sushi and can't resist a bogo offer. But I've never been completely satisfied with the food. We've had the salt and pepper calamari on multiple occasions - sometimes delicious, sometimes over cooked and inedible. Food inconsistency is such a bummer. Most recently I called in an order for sushi take out. When picking up my order, I asked the attendant (whom I later found out was the manager) for some low sodium soy sauce. He seemed annoyed that I asked, grabbed a small, unmarked clear plastic container and handed it to me. Upon arriving home to enjoy my meal, I noticed an odd fishy smell about my food. Noooo! After a couple of bites of sushi I had to stop and toss it --- the rolls tasted like funky fish! I called Akahana and spoke with the manager who gave me the soy sauce, and while he offered to make some new sushi for me, I didn't take him up on it. I also didn't ask for a refund. I did however ask him to visit his kitchen and investigate why my two different sushi rolls shared the same fishy taste and smell. I suspected it was the rice or the nori, but who knows. I'm sad to say it because I love supporting Plaza Midwood businesses, but I will be taking a break from this spot for a while. I hope things improve."}
{"text":"I've been to Akahana a few times and I loved each time. You can't beat sushi and going next door to Rita's for frozen custard."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. The food is good but at times inconsistent. My favorite things to get here are the pineapple fried rice, Vietnamese steak, and sushi.  The sushi is such a bargain. Buy one get one free everyday. You can't beat that. The prices ate very, very reasonable. Fairly inexpensive for a solid meal."}
{"text":"They are located in a strip mall shopping area. Went on a Sunday night and it was a decent crowd. Apparent they have BOGO but BOGO isn't always good usually there is a catch. We were sat upon arriving and several people came by to check up on us while we dined. The server was friendly. We ordered the pineapple drink to share which tasted like pineapple juice we were told it had three different rums in it. The decor was basic. The sushi wasn't that great it didn't seem fresh. I ended up breaking out in hives after eating it. Weird. I will probably not return and they seem to have several loyal customers......"}
{"text":"Was in the Plaza area of town this afternoon so I stopped into Akahana for sushi. I was met by a young lady who had an upbeat, bubbly vibe. She was very professional & made sure I had everything I needed throughout my time there. I sat at the sushi bar and had nice conversation with one of the chefs, who is opening his own Akahana in Belmont soon. The thinly sliced fish in the prep station looked fresh and was very colorful. I had the Raging Demon roll & the special Stupid Cupid roll. Both had eel, which I favor and were tasty & thankfully, solidly packed so it didn't fall apart (pet peeve of mine when it comes to sushi). However, I always enjoy alittle fresh, chilled ginger to finish my meal but their's was tainted beige and browning on some edges. Now here's my primary complaint: the odor in there is nasty; That dirty floor, wipe-counters-with-the-same-rag-over & over again- kind of smell. Now, I know I'm somewhat OCD clean & germ conscientious & I challenge myself to tone that down.  So I dug deep & stayed and ate but I prayed I wouldn't get sick all the way home! I know I  can't be the only one who senses some slacking in cleanliness there.  BOGO so I had two 8-pc.rolls for $15.00 + $6 tip (on the full amt., as is customary) = $21.00 and I was stuffed. Will I go back? Nope....no need to. Too many other, sparkling clean sushi places to visit!  3.5 out of 5 because the rolls were good and the staff was excellent. They just need to hire a new cleaning company to use some vinegar/bleach & steam that place from top to bottom. Or refinish and update the interior  :- /"}
{"text":"Me and my friend go here often the sesame seed chicken is amazing the menu is large so I always try something new service isn't always the best but I still come here for the food"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hidden spot in Charlotte to enjoy sushi. I am sure there are other restaurants and bistros but this is my personal favorite. They have awesome service everytime I visit. The sushi tastes great and they have a BOGO deal on rolls. Great for lunch or dinner! No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Don't try Vietnamese food when you come to Akahana. I wonder the Owner is vietnamese? Very disappointed dinner last night, they used the food leftover few days old to served for us because it's stink and make me headache, Bánh xeo was disaster, terrible. it was cold instead of hot and crispy, they used the leftover red roast pork from sandwiches and split boil shrimp from goi cuon ( spring rolls) for banh xeo( yellow crepe), all the dishes that I ordered that was bad. Pho was bad, too. Meat smell and not tender, salty, noodles still hard... look like they brought it out from refrigerator and didn't heat up... never come back here again"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, and I didn't have good memories of it. We wanted sushi, but didn't want to drive all the way to ru sans. I wish I did now.   The first bad omen was the mold on the menu. Black mold growing from moisture and stickiness in the menu. Guh-ross!!   I ordered the tropical exotic roll. The menu description was so misleading it made it seem like the soy paper would be cut in designs, but the roll was actually like a sushi quesadilla, but not in a good way.   The other roll I got was meh... The crab tasted like crab out of a can, it wasn't even the imitation krab, which I typically dislike but would've been better.   All in all, I'll probably never come back here. Even with bogo sushi. I see why it's bogo, they want to get rid of it as much as I disliked it."}
{"text":"What I ordered to go: Stir fried vegetables with chicken and no mushrooms, light white sauce, brown rice; spring rolls.  What I got: bland, over cooked vegetables with gloppy corn starch sauce.  Spring rolls were ok."}
{"text":"The private party room is cool and great for a party with friends!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian places in the QC. The bar is amazing and the sushi is great. Just say I love sushi."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has 3 stars. I love their bogo sushi (of course). My only complaint is sometimes it takes a while to get food depending how busy it is but I'd say it's because the sushi is great and it takes a while for the staff to make it. The wonton soup is also great."}
{"text":"Conveniently located on the corner of The Plaza and Central, Akahana is a nice little bistro with great potential.  There are plenty of things to like about Akahana, but definitely a few glitches to this place.  The Good:  1. The location: I can't think of any other sushi places in this area, and it's just a hop, skip and a jump away for anyone who lives near this neighborhood.  2. The decor:  It has a kind of trendy look, but some nice decor.  The bar area is very cool, all lit up.  The waterfall at the door looks great as well.  It's a little dark, but fairly cozy-looking.  3. A huge menu: Their menu is very large, with a great selection of appetizers, sushi rolls, noodle dishes (different Asian styles), salads and more.  4. $5 lunches: I am not sure what time lunch ends, but in addition to getting lunch-sized portions of food, you can also get $5 at certain times on weekdays.  They have sushi lunches, noodles, and a few others.  They have pretty decent portion sizes for $5 too.  5. The drink menu: They also have an extensive number of specialty drinks.    6. The spicy edamame:  Not too hot, but full of flavor (maybe a chili sauce mixed with teriyaki?).  The OK:  1. Buy One Get One Half Off:  All right, this is a pretty decent deal (it's every day all day), and they offer it on pretty much all of their sushi rolls.  The rolls range from like $5-18, depending on what you're getting.  Their specialty rolls start at around $9 and up.  They are pretty decent sized rolls too for the price.  2. The quality:  The fish quality is ok.  It's not as fresh as Yama or the Cowfish, but it's decent.  The sushi rice is pretty good, with just the right texture of stickiness and plenty of flavor (the right balance of savory/sweet, not too sweet or vinegary, with hints of sesame).  Some of the rolls are downright delicious, but some are just mediocre.  3. The drinks: The cucumber martini was very strong and not quite my style, but probably good for people who really love that brand of vodka.  I had one drink (I can't remember the name) that was pretty decent, but not very heavy on the booze.  I had their sangria once, and it was decent but watered down.  The Not-So-Good  1. The service:  I have had decent service once, but two other times it has not been great.  It was virtually dead in there every time I've gone (I've only been there at a late lunch time). In three trips, I have not once gotten my appetizer before the rest of the food, so the timing is a little weird.   Overall, A-OK is probably an accurate summary of my experiences here."}
{"text":"*giant sigh of disappointment* So, in my last update, I mentioned that this was no place to write home about. Well you can now! If you feel like being negative...  So I ordered a veggie roll (8 pieces, $12. Are you kidding me?!) and my friend ordered some sort of salmon roll (8 pieces, $12 also...). Jimmy ordered chocolate cake.   And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.... and 20-40 minutes later, we were finally served. Jimmy's cake was literally one of those generic three-layer-take-out-of-freezer-and-thaw cakes. Super sweet, cold and high in preservatives. Sushi places usually have some sort of mochi, ice cream or sweet rice- not here! My sushi was barely cut all the way through and not laid out too nicely. It was pretty disappointing.  The server I have had before and he was awful and not very attentive... I thought it was maybe because he was doing prep work at lunch. Thennn there was this time. He wasn't working any other tables once we ordered and the service was still awful. Miscommunication with the bar (my friends ordered sake and it came INCREDIBLY late), Jimmy's cake (they said they were out of cake after 20 minutes, then brought some out 10-20 minutes later), and of course a long time until we got our food.  Oh Akahana... tweak your staff, adjust your sushi prices (get rid of the buy one, get one free and just make them reasonably priced), lower the terrible music and get some decent desserts. Then we'll talk again."}
{"text":"Come here quite often as its close to my neighborhood. If you are looking for a diamond in the rough this is not it. What it does provide is tasty and reasonably priced sushi in a hip atmosphere. Some of their daily specials include $1 sushi (which is actually decent quality) and BOGO or 1/2 off sushi rolls. Again if you are looking to just satisfy a craving this is a good place."}
{"text":"Even worse than before.  Prices have gone up. Service is terrible. Smells strange like mold when you walk in. Unfriendly staff.  Food wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"The sushi is always BOGO which was awesome. We ordered sushi, it was okay. The service was great though! The owner came and checked on us 3 times which I've never seen before. He was very nice and funny!"}
{"text":"Wtf is this! Ok I'm alllll for BOGO. However, my sushi was the size of a dime.... Not worth my money. Maybe I should have purchases fried rice! At least my server was cool."}
{"text":"This is Belmont's newest restaurant and tonight they were packed.  We waited 20 minutes or so for a seat and it was worth the wait.  Our server, Andi (yes with an I he told us) was friendly and efficient with our orders. The food was excellent and plentiful. We will go back again and do highly recommend it.  The only drawback is that it was noisy, but the food and the service was well worth it."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars all the time but this place went above and beyond expectations. Our server Dalton was seriously the best server I've had in probably a year and I go out to eat ~all the time~. Additionally I used to serve so I'm a tough judge of service. The owner, Ian, came over multiple times to welcome us to Charlotte as our server told him we just moved here, and asked us probably 5-6x how we were doing and if there was anything else he could do to make our dining experience more enjoyable.   On Fridays the Saki is heavily discounted at $17/bottle compared to the usual $34/bottle. The BOGO is the COOLEST thing about this place. Seriously any roll you get is buy one get one free of equal or lesser value. Not to mention the sushi was so fresh and so deliciously prepared that I quickly fell in love with this place.  I've lived in Charlotte for 1 week and I think I've already found my favorite sushi spot! Highly recommend to locals and all those traveling through!"}
{"text":"Good Sushi. Decent drinks. Polite staff. Reasonable price. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back here but if I was in the area or someone else wanted to, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Wait... BOGO for all rolls that are already decently priced? What is this, sushi-heaven? I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the sushi rolls offered, but this was a good problem. Having said this, I can't remember what I ordered, but it was fantastic, and I'll definitely be back when I visit Charlotte. Akahana also had some really great drink specials.  Even if this place wasn't BOGO with the rolls, it's still worth a visit.  P.S. The waiter was a bit awkward... but he got the job done."}
{"text":"The Good:  The vibe is good inside- especially considering that it is in a strip mall. It does not look like Cuban Pete's or any of the other restaurants that have died there. It looks good.  There is a random hidden room (near the bathrooms) that looks like it would be a great room for a private party.  The sushi is average to above average. I had the Floridian- I thought it was good, it could have been spicier though.  The menu is big- so non-sushi friends can still tag along.  The prices are reasonable- on Tuesdays and Thursdays a lot of the sushi is half off.  I want to like this place. I want a little sushi place in Plaza Midwood- people want this to work.  The Bad:  It is average. The only reason why I will go back is because it is so close to my house and the competition is not strong in the area.  The waitress was sweet. Incredibly sweet. However, she informed us that she does not eat sushi. She did not know the menu. She was unable to offer suggestions. She looked in over her head. It was like having a vegan server at a steak house. It just didn't work.  I think this place can do well- even with average sushi- but they really need to have better service. Average food and average service does not make a lasting restaurant in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Hey Akahana, lookit you, all sexy with your buy-one-get-one-free rolls on Tuesday and Thursday. Mmm. Yeah, you know what I like.  So, I didn't try the rolls. During this Lenten season, I gave up sugar, both simple and complex, so no rice for me. However, I did try a wide spread, which was delectable.  FOOD: Mmmmsashimi, you never let me down. Their sashimi platter was presented beautifully, with long strips of delicate fish, fashioned into rolls. Very fresh, no odor, and a lovely selection of your usual tuna, salmon, white fish, and mackrel. I also got the squid salad, which had just the right amount of ginger kick to it. The only disappointing part of my meal were the green mussels. I'd never seen this selection on a sushi menu before, so curious, I ordered them. They tasted just like regular mussels, but perhaps a bit more tough. Let-down. :( On the upside, they do make a fabulous dirty martini, and I hear good things about their $2 martini nights on Wednesdays.   SERVICE: Attentive and playful, though not without fault. Was brought the wrong thing twice (wrong martini, and the clams nigiri-style instead of sashimi), but both instances were fixed in no time at all. We did feel like we were being rushed out towards the end. We did spend a while talking after the meal, but there were plenty of seats available, and we were still tossing back a few drinks, so it shouldn't have been an issue.  ATMOSPHERE: Chique, club-like atmosphere, with bold colors, modern lighting, and a very nice back-lit bar. The sushi bar seems a little secluded from the rest of the restaurant, but overall, this place has a modern and sexy feel to it.   PRICE: Average pricing for all items, but great deals on the specials mentioned beforehand. Definitely worth checking out.  Overall: It's nice to know there's a  place where I stuff my face with decent sushi even when I'm broke. Thank you, Akahana."}
{"text":"I'm torn.  Just left Akahana. We got carry out.  My daughter really enjoyed her lunch. And it was a decent portion size for the price. (She got the Chicken Lettuce Wrap for $6.)  My lunch was $4, for two spring rolls. Not bad but I can't be sure it was worth the price. The rolls were small and the garnish (curly thinly shredded carrots) and a few handfuls of the small white thin puffy noodles (?) were painfully meager.  I have pictures. Judge for yourself...  I'm sure my daughter will eat there again. Me? Maybe. Maybe not."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing and the service is great! It's not amazingly flavorful but it's bogo and Delicious for a last minute date! The dragon roll is delicious. Ive never really tired any of the other options besides sushi but the other options seem delectable also!"}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner date on Saturday night. Greeted and seated promptly. Buy 1 Get 1 Sushi Rolls all day every day! Wow! Both meals were fantastic and given amount of food and sake, very reasonably priced. Will def be back."}
{"text":"I've gone twice more to Akahana and either my taste for sushi has become a bit more snobbish or Akahana has gone a bit downhill.  Let's first start with the atmosphere, serious techno beats at 6:30pm on a Thursday is not relaxing. The lights were bright - and it's not really a club atmosphere so why the club music? I am not a big person by any means but I felt as though I was sitting in a little kids chair, I could not imagine if I were a bigger guy.   We started with the spring rolls which were downright gross in my opinion. The pork just had a really funny flavor and they were over-cooked. My boyfriend ate them, but he eats everything ...he even said so himself, so I doubt he really liked them either.  We split four rolls 1) Florida- good flavor, the avocado was fresh and perfect. The tuna is that mashed chopped-up kind and it was just be so much better if it was just a nice small piece of raw tuna.  I also felt like all the rolls were a bit warm.  2) Orange Blossom- Again with the chopped tuna, but at least they had a nice salmon piece. I liked this roll flavor-wise but again with the oddly warm temp.  3) Surf & Turf- It was ok, but I prefer cowfish Burgushi. The meat was just odd ( couldn't tell if it was lightly seared, raw etc.) Just not a huge fan  4) Spider Roll- Worst spider roll I've ever had. It was inedible for me- I had one slice and gave up. It honestly tasted like it had sand in it, even my boyfriend had trouble with this one.   So overall awful atmosphere + lackluster sushi means I probably will not be returning BOGO or not."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the area that has BOGO sushi. Hallelujah. They also have a great patio area outside and daily drink specials. Our server was awesome. Wasn't super impressed by the sushi, we had Spiral Ecstasy, Mango Tango, Florida and Furious Dragon maybe? Also started with summer rolls and edamame. They were both fantastic and the summer rolls are 2 for $4.45.  Gets the job done when you want sushi but don't want to spend $100 for 2 people."}
{"text":"I was craving some basic sushi on my way back to Charlotte after a 4 hour drive.  I wanted something better than grocery store sushi, but didn't feel like driving any further than I had to since I just wanted to be out of the car.  Then I remembered that Akahana was right next to my house!  Perfect opportunity to give them a try.  I ordered a basic roll... salmon, cream cheese & avocado... and a seaweed salad.  Honestly, I wasn't very impressed.  The roll was decent, I mean it's hard to mess up something so basic, but it seemed like it was missing something... and the wasabi tasted watered down if that's even possible.  The seaweed salad was the crunchiest I've ever had and I'm undecided as to whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.  It had good flavor, just super loud!    Also, it was a Thursday, which the sign said BOGO... buy one get one... but I only had one roll in the box when I got home.  ???"}
{"text":"3 stars at most. I don't get why people give it 1 or 5. It's not God awful but it's not amazing. I had two rolls and a won ton soup with tea for 20$. The buy one get one rolls I picked weren't tiny. Maybe it's just certain ones but each one listed on the menu tells how many pieces. I recently had sushi at Ru San and it was comparatively better. I won't be back but I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"The menu is very extensive, so if you don't prefer sushi there are many options to choose from. We did have sushi and it was great, it seemed very fresh (which is something you want in sushi).  The decor is warm and inviting. The service was great, no complaints. The only minor issue we had was that our second round of drinks took longer than expected."}
{"text":"I had the rainbow and dragon roll, along with their lightly fried calamari and salt & pepper chicken wings.  The calamari was great, lightly battered, with a sauce that is slightly sweet and tangy.  Salt and pepper wings were spot on as well, i think its double fried because the wings were larger than what i've seen.  Most importantly, the rolls were bigger than what i've seen at other places, and the prices were average.  The staff were friendly, mostly college students, between 20-30s, fluent in English."}
{"text":"Loved their spicy twist on the Edamame! Sushi was delicious as well.  Great place to grab a bite to eat for a great price!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Akahana. The interior is very tastefully decorated and modern. They have one of those cool waterfall-walls just as you walk in. I wanted to be 6 years old again and stick my hand in.   The place was clean, and the service was also really good. Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. I'm stuck between a 2 and 3 star here, because the entree black bean veggie stir fry dish my companion got was actually decent. What knocked it back was the STALE seaweed.   Aside from the black bean veggie dish, we ordered agedashi tofu and vegetable tempura. They were out of buckwheat noodles, and I can't eat regular noodles or udon anymore, unfortunately. So I stuck to just some appetizers. The tempura was adequate, but it's really not something I'd order again. The vegetables were undercooked on the inside and I wasn't fond of the taste of the batter.    The agedashi tofu was not anything I'd ever seen or tasted, and I *love* agedashi tofu. If it's ever on a menu, I have to order it. What I got here was awful. The tofu tasted old and dry, there was a thick, poor-tasting (old oil?) batter. On top of all this were a few strips of really horribly stale seaweed. The manager(?) noticed we barely touched the dish and she tried to say that it was a \"firm\" tofu they used, so that's why it might have tasted differently. I don't usually play the race card, but she was telling my white companion this while I was in the restroom. When I got back, she just smiled and left. Firm tofu? I've eaten tofu my entire life, whether firm or soft or medium or dessert or silken or chunky homemade or whatever. Question: Why even offer a menu item if you don't make it even remotely right?   They get a plus for having brown rice, but a minus for not having buckwheat noodles; a plus for great decor and good service, but a huge minus for having items on their menu they can't cook properly and also for having poor quality ingredients (read: old)."}
{"text":"Their BOGO free sushi deal can't be beat since it's ongoing! The rolls are a good size and always delicious. The only downside I've experienced is the wait time. We've had to wait between 30-45 min for our food the past few times. We suspect that the servers have just forgotten to put our orders in but they've always been friendly so it's not a huge deal."}
{"text":"It's taken me a while to finally get this review down...and I think it's because I really want to love Akahana but, overall, I just kinda like it. The interior is pretty slick, the menu a large Asian compilation, the staff was friendly and efficient but overall, the food was what held back this review from a 4 star. This ambivalence has delayed my review, but here we go.   BOGO sushi every night now. Yup. Every night. While this is pretty great (as our bill for four rolls and an appetizer was under $40) it's also a little worrisome. Did Akahana jack up the prices of all the sushi to accommodate this special? Or, instead, are they serving smaller or fish of a lesser quality? Well, while the portions were ample, the sushi tasted fine, but not great. Here's the run down.   Asian Summer Roll: 4/5: A fresh, nicely stuffed shrimp Vietnamese inspired spring roll with a thick dipping sauce. Go easy on the sauce.    Spicy Tuna: 3/5: The spicy tuna, while it tasted fine, was strangely very, very red. Like atomic red. Kudos for not slathering the tuna in mayonnaise, but the bright red color frightened me.  Crunchy Tuna Roll: 2/5: Too heavily fried for my tastes and again with the fire engine red tuna?   Cherry Blossom Roll: 4/5: Fresh, tasty and delicious. I would go back just for this roll.   Mt. Fuji Roll: 3/5: A little too sweet  - if I recall correctly it was topped with mango and a too much sweet sauce. Could be delightful if it was suaceless.   I may head back to Akahana for lunch or to pick up some sushi to go...it's definitely worth another try, if not just for BOGO!"}
{"text":"Buy one, get one sushi rolls. That means one thing to me: I should probably order four rolls. Right? RIGHT?!   Spoiler alert: I can't eat four rolls by myself. I gave it my best shot though.   My latest trip here was for take out grub. I walked in after yoga. Hot mess express over here. I posted up at the bar, ordered myself a glass of Prosecco and dove into the overwhelming menu.   My selections: Spicy spider, Spiral Ecstasy, Watermelon, and Cherry Blossom rolls. The Spicy spider and Spiral Ecstasy were the winners. I love rolls wrapped in cucumber instead of rice. Unfortunately, the cucumber didn't look all that appealing for the Watermelon.  Four rolls + one glass of Prosecco = $38. I could've easily been okay with just two rolls.   The bartender was super friendly and attentive. He helped me go through the endless list of options. Call it the never-ending menu. I would gladly sit at the bar any time he was working for a meal.  Akahana is a decent little sushi spot. Nothing too fancy. Rolls aren't super creative. Great specials throughout the week. Worth a trip if you're craving sushi in the Plaza Midwood 'hood."}
{"text":"Wow! Bogo sushi rolls. Can't beat it. Had a excellent experience with my family here. You have to try the shaking beef!! Good selection of sake for reasonable price. Go on Tuesdays and it's half off bottles!!!! Last but not least service was spot on. Must give Akahana a try!"}
{"text":"Buy one get one free roll. Delicious sushi. Great prices. The service is great and friendly. It's a great hole in the wall that's tucked away in the corner."}
{"text":"Ummm, BOGO sushi all the time and amazing spicy edamame... do I need to say anything else??  Decent drafts on tap and sake available, combined with decent prices and some delicious sushi, it is a definite go-to."}
{"text":"I've always had really good experiences here. Seriously, never had a bad meal. I almost always do the buy one get one sushi rolls. My favorite is the Charlotte and bagel roll. Spicy edamame is very delicious too!"}
{"text":"My favorite date spot for the price. Sushi is Always fresh and visually stunning. Service has been rough before, so now we just go to the bar. Edwin, the bartender is awesome. Saketinis are surprisingly tasty. Cant beat the quality matched with affordability. Good to see something Good that location since the graduate."}
{"text":"You can't beat all day every day buy one get one free sushi that's actually really good. A great place I love to frequent when I'm in the neighborhood. Good for large groups or a quiet date. Spicy edamame, soups and salads are all good starters. On my last visit, we asked our server about the sake and she basically explained she didn't know much about it and whatever she did tell us honestly made us more confused. But other than that, the food came out fast, was delicious and a great value."}
{"text":"Asian food is always at the top of my list! I loved Akahanana, we stopped in for a late night beverage and snacky food - it was a good choice, friendly service, good prices, yummy good, great drinks, not much more you could ask for."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite sushi place in the city! The service is wonderful! The food is wonderful! The prices are wonderful! And they have BOGO free sushi rolls every day! I come here once or twice a week, and I always get the Ahi Hawaiian roll and the Bagel roll, but my boyfriend is a bit more adventurous so he has tried most of the sushi menu, and it's always delicious!  We usually sit at the bar, where Hannah waits on us and she is an amazing bartender! She always gives great service and is extremely friendly! But we were in there last week for my birthday and decided to sit at a patio table outside since we had our puppy with us. Candice was our server, and she is great as well! She was very very attentive and friendly! The staff and the food made it a wonderful experience as usual!"}
{"text":"My \"go-to\" sushi spot!! Great for take-out and dining in! Staff is always friendly and I love their sushi roll selection. Highly recommend the Florida roll, Charlotte roll and Volcano roll. BOGO, all day, everyday!"}
{"text":"I'll be generous and give Akahana 3 stars when it should probably be 2.5 stars. I was a frequent flyer of this place when it first opened, mostly because for a year this nice little bistro who offered buy one get one free sushi rolls. As someone who should probably open her own sushi restaurant to get a return on my investment, anytime I can save cash on sushi is a plus.  A while back the restaurant management changed and switched the deal to buy one get one half off. I understand this a business with profits to make so it didn't upset me but left my sushi-loving soul disappointed. Yet, I only dined here a good bit due to price and not quality... and even though the rolls the discounted, the prices are a bit higher so not truly snagging a discount. The sushi isn't bad by any means but not memorable - nothing that blows me away. At Ru Sans I covet the Firecracker roll. At Sushi 101, I always snag the Sir Justin roll. But I have yet to find an amazing roll at Akahana. Pretty average sushi here with no special sauces, ingredients or anything that makes me crave this eatery.  However, props to the bistro for the atmosphere. It's a sleek, modern design with plenty of room between the booths and tables so you're not invading anyone's personal space. Upon walking in, you're greeted with a waterfall trickling down a tall glass panel that almost hits the ceiling... nice touch. We've always been seated promptly at the restaurant and service is more times than not good. Never had bad service, just slow... and last time I never got my requested side of aioli... blasphemy.  Plus parking is easy and Akahana is located conveniently in Plaza Midwood... no fancy parallel parking here or trying to figure out how one-way streets connect."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! A friend and I came here after work to try it out and had a very positive experience. The sushi is fresh and you can't beat the buy one get one deal. Ian, the new manager came by several times to make sure we were having a pleasant experience and even cracked some jokes to get us laughing.   I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone in the Charlotte area. I'm completely confident in saying this sushi is the bomb"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. The rolls are 2 for 1 at lunch. Had the furious dragon roll and it was the best sushi I've ever had. Will definitely be returning. The decor was beautiful and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place.  I read some iffy reviews AFTER already being there! Big mistake!! The waitress was friendly & the food came out quick.  The veggie dumplings seemed good.  The crab wonton also seemed ok.  My friend had the tropical roll...gross!!! Gross gross!!! He said it tasted like a warm tuna sandwich! It smelled sooooo bad.  I also had a jalapeño margarita that was just terrible!!!! It tasted like pure sour mix, no spice at all.  As soon as I left, my stomach started hurting.  It hurt the entire night so bad that I had to go home.  I got sick later and stayed sick the remainder of the night and AM. I have never had food poisoning, but I suspect I may have gotten a touch of it! The bathrooms here were disgusting by the way...YUCK!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went back with El Husbando and discovered that:  Unsurprisingly, rolls are half the size on BOGO night.   Anything labeled \"small/large\" can be ordered in those proportions during dinner hours - \"lunch/dinner\" cannot.  Ma Po tofu is brown sauce with dried red pepper flakes. Still nowhere in CLT making this dish properly.  Akahana performed up to its solid, safe pan-Asian rep. Let's see if it lasts."}
{"text":"Akahaha was OK at best. Very good prices with the BOGO deal on sushi but the quality was not astounding. It gets the job done for sushi on a budget but not if you're looking for mouth watering sushi. My friend ordered the pho and the presentation was very nice. The curry vegetables was also tasty.   Service was great and no wait time."}
{"text":"I really love this place at times I mean it has my favorite roll in Charlotte... the Charlotte roll. It's not the best sushi in town but it's better than most at the price point. My problem with this place is that I'll call to make a to go order and almost every time i get a busy signal! When I finally get through to a person they put me on hold for a full minute. It's so frustrating! They also need more parking. That's why they get 3 stars from me. It's not the food it's the service. Even when I eat in the service isn't the best. However when the owner is there he visits every table in such a fun loving manor. Maybe I'm being harsh?"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. I have come here and had great sushi and then today, it was the opposite. The sushi wasn't bad, or fishy, but it also just wasn't good. I got the Florida roll, and the tempura \"crunchies\" tasted more like a slice of bread inside my roll. They all kind of tasted like rice than the fish and veggies that you should taste. The service was wonderful, but it did take longer than usual to get our food, and there wasn't a crowd. Their BOGO deal is good, especially when you factor the cost of one roll. If you're in Plaza and don't want to travel around the city, it's still a decent spot."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi last week so I finally decided to try this place out and...I am a FAN! First of all, how can you dislike BOGO 1/2 off sushi rolls?! I'm pretty sure they offer this daily. They have a ton of specialty rolls to choose from (yes, even vegetarian) as well as a myriad of other asian fusion dishes. The drinks are delicious too. If you're a fan of electro music then they've got you covered as well.   So glad I live near this place because I will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Akahana is in my next of the woods, yet it has taken me forever to get in the door. I had heard it had gone down hill in the past year, but wanted to check it out for myself. I walked inside and was really impressed with the décor. Very stylish and trendy. We dropped in on a Sunday around dinner time. There was no wait and they had some drink specials. I was encouraged to stay away from the sushi, and I heeded the advice and went with my tried but true love, Pad Thai. We also spilt the crab won tons and my friend ordered the chicken fried rice. Our server seemed to be having an off day, very nice and kind, but kept forgetting things we ordered. Crab won tons were ok, nothing to ring the bell over, but were sufficient. Pad Thai was a huge portion and had a nice crunch with a healthy dose of peanuts Definitely could have been spicier, but that's where Sriracha saves the day. The chicken fried rice was also a huge portion, but bland and needed more vegetables. Overall, just a meh experience. I would go back once more to try something different and see if there are any redeeming factors."}
{"text":"Really great rolls! With great variety and well made. Avg roll is $14 so with bogo special they have everyday spending about $14for two rolls. The other Sunday night though we were there about 2hrs with about 1.15 waiting on food. They were busy but need to be able to keep up with demand"}
{"text":"Great location, clean restaurant, cozy seating. The menu is enormous, but everything I've had has been amazing!  Love the Vietnamese shaking beef!"}
{"text":"A decent sushi spot. We ordered the Furious Dragon roll (loved it), Surf and Turf roll (it was okay), Charlotte roll (loved it) and Mahina roll (did not like). Service was kinda slow (eventhough it wasn't really busy) but everyone we talked to was nice.   Bottom line: not my favorite sushi spot (shout out Cowfish!) but not the worst in Charlotte. If we want sushi near our house, we will go here and stick to the rolls we liked."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the Buffalo Roll and Cherry Blossom Roll and it was awesome. They have the BOGO all week long and pretty amazing specials. Great for date night or just to have a quick bite. Doesn't take as long as you average sushi place."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant. All of their sushi rolls are buy one get one free, so you can get two specialty rolls for $15. It's a great deal for the quality sushi they serve. We got the Golden Gate/San Francisco roll and the Maui Wowie roll. We loved both of them. The flavors worked great together. We also got the Shrimp Pineapple fried rice which we loved. It was served with half of a hollowed out pineapple which was a cool touch. If you're looking for good sushi at a great price, you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Meh if you want sushi in the plaza area and don't want to drive anywhere then I guess this place would be acceptable in a crunch, but I wouldn't go here as a destination. Friend suggested we try this place out since they do BOGO sushi. Great love a good deal and fresh sushi!   Unfortunately, Akahana offered neither of these things. First the sushi is definitely Americanized in terms of everything having cream cheese, panko, spicy mayo, and being deep fried. Yes, they have a few rolls that are not adulterated with saturated fat, but for the most part it is very heavy on American style sushi. Great for some people, not my style.   Secondly, their BOGO offer is a sham. Ordered two rolls as they are BOGO at about $14-16 a pop. I'm expecting a decently sized and well prepared roll for $15. Unfortunately the rolls come out and mine was missing the crab on top - didn't say anything because our waitress was never to be seen again. Additionally the rolls were extremely small in terms of filling. In most other sushi joints the same roll would go for about $6-8. So if you do the math on that ....you aren't really getting BOGO in terms of value. You are being sold an idea of BOGO predicated on inflated prices that ensure you're paying full market value for each roll. Don't get me wrong, I get this is a business and profit is important, but come on? $16 for a small roll that isn't even prepared with all the listed ingredients? Then you try to convince me I'm getting a deal by getting a second subpar roll?   I won't be back personally since I could get the same sushi cheaper at Harris Teeter across the road."}
{"text":"Hit up Akahana again and can confirm that the sushi is still tops and that they still haven't a clue when it comes to fried food. BUT I must add that the Tom Kha Gai soup (Thai coconut chicken soup) was the BEST I've ever had on the East Coast. A meal in itself, it's sweet and savory, spicy and citric--so satisfying! I will definitely be back to sample more of the Thai offerings."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice today; the food is that good. My friend suggested this place for lunch. I had the Spicy Lemongrass Chicken, which was delicious, but not spicy. While looking over the menu, we saw that Akahana has hibachi. My friend texted his wife (a big hibachi fan), and we decided to come back for dinner. At dinner all five of us enjoyed our meals. For dinner, I had the Spicy Basil Chicken (again, not spicy except for the jalapenos mixed in). The service was decent, but could have been better. But the food and the atmosphere are fantastic. This is another great restaurant choice in Plaza Midwood. I defintely recommend anyone to enjoy dinner here."}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi spot! Whether it's takeout or dining in the bogo sushi specials are truly worth the parking dilemma. The best thing is bogo specials are every day all day... How much better does it get??!! who doesn't love two-for-one sushi!! They have vegan and vegetarian rolls which suit my diet! My husband loves surf and turf and orange blossom.   Other personal favorites in our house include: crab wontons, Japanese garden rolls with tofu, seaweed salad and chicken lettuce wraps.   Go for the bogo Sushi and eat until you pop!"}
{"text":"This place had tasty sushi and a great atmosphere. It was busy , but had plenty of room . Everyone was enjoying themselves and the service was great . The BOGO rolls was a nice addition . We had rolls , hand rolls , sashimi, several soups , and seaweed salad . All were very good , I enjoyed that the rice around the rolls was on the thinner side . It really made the roll more enjoyable that you could taste the difference in the rolls and not just rice . The soups were amazing ! Try this place ."}
{"text":"This was the best sushi I have had in awhile in Charlotte. All rolls are always BOGO, and they offer a wide variety. The first time I went I got take-out and the second time I dined it. The service was good but we were one of the few groups in the restaurant. Haven't tried the other parts of their menu yet but will definitely be back for their sushi."}
{"text":"I live nearby but have never been to this restaurant.  Finally went last night and loved it.  My friends had sushi and I had Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai was excellent.  This place may be a regular.  It has takeout too!"}
{"text":"First of all I come here just for the sushi. I've tried most of the dishes and the only one I like is the lemon grass chicken dish. As an asian, none of the food are authentic at all. Don't get pho because you can spend money at vietnamese restaurant that can taste way better for a cheaper price. So the boyfriend and I ordered togo for the first time, the person who picked up the phone was a young man with brown hair? I can't recall. But I had a couple of questions and I think I can be the reason why he messed up my order. But he repeated back my order before we hanged up... and he forgot to tell me the total amount of my order. When we get there it seems like they were busy. I tipped him because I understand how it is. And because he answered my difficult questions. When I got home and looked at the food... I didn't get my order right. I ordered sushi and it was fine... BUT i ordered vegetarian sushi and it was next to my boyfriend's dragon roll. It wasn't a big deal for me... but for other vegetarians it might be. So please put that into consideration!  For our meal, we ordered lemon grass chicken and flat rice noodle with chicken. I don't know why.. but he messed up the flat rice noodle dish. Instead, I got a Chicken and vegetables with no rice... and I got a side order of flat rice noodle with just vegetables and no meat? WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? How do you mess this up? Because even though I tried eating the chicken and vegetable dish it had no seasoning. It needed salt and sugar. It was so bland. I swear I come back because I want to see if there's a great dish that I haven't found... but I think its because there isn't. I don't even know what and how much I paid for... I can't even refund my money because he didn't hand me my receipt. Half my fault that I didn't ask... but c'mon. Youre running a business here. I shouldn't have to ask for a receipt... I'm the customer. A receipt should be handed to me."}
{"text":"Previously, I felt that this restaurant was not one to \"Yelp home about,\" but my last visit really stood out.  Akahana is located in a strip mall within walking distance of our home.  It features \" buy one, get one half price\" sushi rolls.  My husband and I have been here a few times and had an \"ok\" meal.  But this last time?  Holy blow fish!  Did that sushi chef just graduate to a black belt in rolls?  We ordered three vegetarian rolls that rivaled those at our favorite sushi restaurants.  Plus, service was sharp and snappy, to the point that the waiter nearly snatched away my last sip of wine as I lifted my glass.  Definitely warrants an encore and soon. But, I'm gluing my wine glass to my hand."}
{"text":"I have had mostly mediocre to just plain horrible service at Akahana - yet its close proximity to my home keeps me coming back, mostly now for take-out.   I do love some of their rolls, even when they mess up my order its usually still good. The BOGO offer (all day every day eat in or take out)can work in your favor, and sometimes you're not saving anything. Fancy rolls? sure, definitely could use a half off. Generic/veg rolls? No thanks. Yeah, I'm getting half off my california roll but they charge $9 to begin with, double what other sushi joints charge, so not really a great steal.   I'm slowly venturing off their sushi menu. I really like their hot and sour soup, a lot. The stirfrys are alright. I've tried almost every appetizer and although I don't have a favorite, I also don't have a \"never order again\"... though the ginger dressing on the house salad is more often than not so bitter it ruins everything, so I usually skip that.   I'd like to go in and enjoy my meal more often, but even when there's only one other table I still can't get my server to pay attention to me, so I'd rather just skip the whole \"service\" part. And it's really nice they're open late on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Being in the area, I decided to order pick-up for lunch and was pleased with meal, however found it just lay for the prices. Overall seemed a little high for the amount of food. I would like to dine in and check out a few more selections...so, look for an updated review soon."}
{"text":"This update is for their lunch special.  $5 awesomeness is what it is. My first try was the curry chicken, it was the biggest plate of food I never expected. While it took a little longer to get the food out, it's still a great deal.  And mind you, it was a Saturday.  Yes, lunch special is available on weekends too.  My 2nd try was during the week.  I called ahead to place my order (magnolia beef) to cut out wait time. I showed up and the food rolled out. This time the portion wasn't as big but still very satisfying. Service was solid both times.  And the food tasted good with consistent quality.  They actually have sushi lunch special too, all $5.  I swear this place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Here is yet another time I wish for a half star because I am a bit torn between a 2 and 3 stars. So I dutifully read reviews from some of my favorite people on Yelp before heading over to this place so I thought I knew what I was getting into. BUT unfortunately I was still disappointed!  Let's start off with their bogo sushi \"deal\" $14 for two rolls is pretty standard for a basic sushi place but these rolls were the SKIMPIEST I have ever encountered. The fish on the outside of both my rolls was paper thin and the roll itself was about the circumference of a quarter. So for $14 I would have been better of going across the street for sushi at Harris Teeter.  My wife is not a sushi person so she got one of their rice dishes which came so over salted she could not even eat it:(  I will say what I assume was the owner or manager of the place was all over the restaurant checking in with guests which was nice to see. If he had asked me how my meal was thought I would have told him I was a pretty disappointed.   I really want this place to be better so I might keep an eye on it because I would love for it to be more like New Zealand Cafe:)"}
{"text":"I love this place. And I honestly think the feeling is mutual. The staff and owner make me feel appreciated. Not to mention....the food is excellent. BOGO rolls and drink specials make it a great value as well. Best sushi spot in Plaza Midwood and NoDa."}
{"text":"Akahana, finally a good BOGO sushi place! They have a good selection of rolls from $10-15, and then a monster lobster roll from $24. I've come here a couple of times with some friends who are regulars. We've ordered sake as well, the white peach is the best and Asian pear is disgusting. We had to switch out our sake the last time we were here, wasn't an issue when we approached management about the horrible tasting Asian pear sake. I like the fact that they have low carb and veggie options, not sure if they offer brown rice. I got the Butterfly roll (12) and the garden roll (10) last time I was here and was not disappointed. The butterfly roll is very hearty while the garden was light. I didn't want to go to heavy on the spicy mayo (even though I love it, damn diet). Total was around 22 for two rolls and a large sake carafe. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place, so I go a lot.  I have to admit that I don't like the music (think at a trendy nightclub) or the decor (the centerpiece is a sheet of glass with water running down it).  However.... everything, for me, revolves around the BOGO sushi rolls.  I can go into this place with a friend and we can both gorge ourselves on pretty good sushi for about 35$ total.  There are usually 1$ PBRs (I know, I know, a very classy way to wash down sushi), so I can have my full \"dine and catch a light buzz\" experience for about the same price.    I've never had a bad experience at this place, maybe some slow service but the rolls I order have always been on point and delicious.  The waitress I have the most often is also super nice, keeps my water topped and my beers coming.  Be warned though, it took me about three visits to figure out what is good and what just looks good on the menu.  Akahana is not world class-but it is a great deal with friendly servers.  Like any great deal you might have to do a little work on your end to make the experience match up to your expectations.  I highly recommend the place, as well as any of the flash fried rolls.  Mmmmmmmm Americanized sushi.  Yummmmm  There are also plenty of big TVs, so kick back and watch something while you stuff your face, I mean delicately pick up your sushi with your fancy chopsticks...."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Great location for Plaza Midwood. The soup is fabulous."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating. A ton of creative sushi rolls to choose from, but also a good selection of Thai and other Asian inspired dishes. It's right next to a used book store and a Rita's with good parking, so it's a fun afternoon all in one place. The manager (or maybe owner?) was very friendly and his staff were accommodating to our odd requests. Chicken on the fried rice was pretty bland, but the rice itself was good. Maybe not the very best sushi I ever had, but still great and filling and BOGO all the time is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Got takeout - 4 rolls for $30 (BOGO all day everyday). It was just okay...kind of subpar. Especially the sashimi roll, there was hardly any fish in it. They didn't include any wasabi. The tuna was dry too. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Akahana is an absolute must do for the Plaza Midwood neighborhood location. The food is fantastic, the environment is fun, and the staff is second to none. Ian and Dalton always go out of their way to make sure our experience is the best in town. Hands down best place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here because I had a desire for Asian and my friend wanted fried rice. We walked in about 7:45 pm to a messy restaurant, but were seated right away. Great I thought! Dinner rush usually means things are on point. I ordered signature dish, spicy basil with chicken. She ordered deluxe fried rice.   No more than 5 minutes passed and our food was at the table. This is NOT a good sign. Rice was hot, but everything else was luke warm (including meats not at temp). We mentioned this and they took our food back. Not 1 minute more and it was back to our table....nice and microwaved.  The hostess came over, and I said, \"Hey, food that is this quick can't be fresh.\" We sent the food back and it was sent back to us less than a minute! Even fried rice takes more than 5 mins between ordering and completion.\" The hostess said,  \"I am sorry but we can't make everything fresh during dinner.\"  Lose. What a poor example of existence. So many other choices...."}
{"text":"i LOVE Akahana.  My boyfriend and I usually eat their once a week, and it is definitely our favorite restaurant.  Not only is the food fantastic, it's pretty cheap as well.  For dinner, we each usually get an appetizer and a roll and with tip it usually comes out under $30.  Nice!    I'd have to say that Felipe is my favorite waiter by far, he has made it a point to remember my boyfriend and I's names, and he's full of personality.  The other servers there are good too, but there have been a couple of occasions where certain ones try too hard to pressure you into drinks, apps, desserts, etc, and one of them always seems fake nice!  The hostess Camela is very sweet, and I look forward to seeing her when I come in.  The sushi is great, although sometimes my roll looks sloppier than other times (I usually get the same one because it's so good).  My boyfriend always enjoys his sushi.  I've also had the curry, and loved it!     If you haven't been to Akahana, you should go.  It's cheap (BOGO half off rolls!), the atmosphere is nice, and the food is good."}
