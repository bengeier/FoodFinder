{"text":"Great price for good teriyaki! Eat here all of the time especially with grubhub, it's really easy to get this delivered to you for lunch. Go to for sure."}
{"text":"I used to eat here almost every day many years ago but Service always could have been better, although recently I decided to check it out for the first time in five years and it seems as though it's a completely different restaurant the services amazing the food is delicious and quick and I noticed they know many of the guests by name. Keep up the improvement I will be eating there for years to come!"}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD! Fast and Friendly! There is not usually a line unless you on Fridays when they have $5/Fridays"}
{"text":"Great service, very polite and courteous. Food was good, hardly a wait at all.  Fun place."}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers Max & Mel ;) are hooked on their teriyaki bowls. I usually eat here at least once or twice a week for lunch. Conveniently located close to my work and very reasonably priced. I especially try to stop by on Fridays for their five dollar teriyaki bowl special. Staff is very friendly and food always tastes great."}
{"text":"I'm glad I had to wait until I got home to approve my review because it gave me time to stew in the upset stomach I was dealing with the rest of work. The actual meat tasted decent, what little of it there was, but what came with the special was just awful. A bunch of rice with no seasoning and a tasteless salad. And the place smells like sewage.... I checked the health inspector reports and apparently it's doing fine though..."}
{"text":"Very cozy and gets really busy at lunch.  Prices are fair.  Try the teriyaki chicken rice bowl!"}
{"text":"This is my Friday lunch treat place downtown.  Consistently reliably tasty food.  And great staff.  I happened to lose my wallet there today and the manage tried to track me down to get it back to me.  Great lunch venue and menu."}
{"text":"Food is really good!  Tasty.  Truly no MSG because neither my wife nor I felt thirsty and I didn't have a headache.  A major shout out to the friendly burly guy with the cool beard (wish I could remember his name - although his middle name is \"customer service\") who although was on his lunch break sitting eating at a regular table, piped up and invited us to ask any questions about the menu.  He answered all of our questions and at the end when we let him know we only received 1 fortune cookie he offered a handful, although we only took 1 more, we appreciated his approach.  We felt he approached the customer relationship as if he was an owner.  Our only complaint is that the styrofoam dishes aren't environmentally friendly and are cheap looking; they are probably trying to save money on a dishwasher and labor but still."}
{"text":"Ok . Off the central light rail station phoenix is a bento bento done real bad. The korean ramen looked like and tasted like ramen noddle package bought at an asian store. The only thing real was the chicken strips. Yakisoba was bland old soba sauce used. Bulgogi's secret sauce... please keep it to yourselves do not share that to the world. Oh well I noticed office workers in buildings nearby have no real choice to real japanese korean asian food. Reason I can tell mediocre bentos....i've been to japan several times and korea.....and this bento place in central phoenix has the most expensive worst tasting bentos so far ..just real bad copies of the real ramens etc"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best \"go to\" places for lunch in Downtown Phoenix. As a salmon lover, I have to split up the salmon offerings around downtown, and Yasda Bento is one of my favorites when I'm looking for something quick, reasonably priced, relatively healthy, and tastes great. Their Salmon Teriyaki Bowl is it. Broccoli is always fresh, love the option of brown rice, regular or large bowl. It just works for me and apparently many others. The manager is all about great service; which is efficient and quick. It's a small place and gets crowded very quick, AND they've been known to run out of MY favorite if I arrive too close to closing. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"Ok ... Good tasting meatballs, average salad ... nice to have 5 veggie mix in the rice along with some scrambled eggs but way too much black pepper IMO ... was it worth 10 bucks for a special with a cup of hot tea? ... a bit high"}
{"text":"I ordered their ramen and just paid $8 for cup-o-noodles. This was horrible. They could at least have some of their \"fresh vegetables\" they deceivingly pride themselves on. There was nothing fresh about this place."}
{"text":"Very strange!   I normally order from Yasda Bento at work because it affordable, easy to order online, and they deliver. I normally get the spicy chicken rice bowl or the yakisoba noodle bowl which is AMAZING with some soy sauce! However, they always forget the soy sauce. Every time! This has happened roughly 10 times. I even called them once to make sure they would put it in there and sure enough...no soy sauce.   So every time I order, I request it (not expecting it to come) but I tip accordingly. If you forget a customer request (things like soy sauce), I'm not going to tip you the full percent. Very simple. So the last time I ordered, the receipt had a hand written \"suggested gratuity\" telling me that I need to tip 18%-20%. I found this to be very rude and totally out of line. I would tip this amount but you can even put two little packets of soy sauce in my bad. I'm kind of over it and think that this sort of behavior is rude and doesn't deserve my money.   What is 18%-20% of $0.00? Way to go Yasda Bento...you lost a customer for being greedy and inefficient."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. It has a very small dining area though. It can accomodate a group of 8. But  not good for bigger groups."}
{"text":"Ordered veggie bowl no rice. Veggies crisp and delicious. Tasted the chicken teriyaki & smoked to perfection. Cashier was very personable w/everyone who walked in."}
{"text":"I have worked in this area for several years now.  Amazingly, I had never stepped foot into this location (even when it was Yoshi's years ago) until a few weeks ago.  After that first time, I was back twice more the very next week.  Yasda Bento is quick, easy, and inexpensive.  Walk up, order your food, pay, wait for your number and you're on your way.  The dish I am addicted to right now is the Hiyashi Noodle Salad - Cold noodle salad with lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cucumbers and chicken breast with light soy vinaigrette for $5!!  Perfect light lunch portion, cold noodles, a few veggies, and some (somewhat dry) chicken, but with the vinaigrette, all is fine. Very refreshing for a summer-time dish.  My addiction all started, by the way, from a Yelp talk thread on good noodle places.  While I would not add Yasda to that list, the conversation had me craving noodles and there are limited choices within walking distance of my building.    Yasda is a good place for a quick, cheap lunch with lots of (typical Asian) options for veggies and meat-heads alike!"}
{"text":"I went to Yasda Bento for the first time today and had a terrible experience. It was during the lunch hour, but they were not terribly busy. I ordered their advertised lunch special, a simple beef dish. It took over 20 minutes to arrive, even though there were only 2 orders ahead of mine. When the meal arrived, the amount of beef present in the dish was so scarce that I was surprised they actually called the dish \"beef\" anything. It was practically a garnishment. When I asked for more, the staff simply said, \"that's how it's prepared.\" The meal itself was marginal at best. Also, their bathroom was an absolute mess. The combination of an overly long wait, a minimal amount of meat in a dish advertised as a \"beef\" dish, a dismissive staff, and a disgusting bathroom was more than enough to convince me never to frequent their establishment again."}
{"text":"I was all geared up to eat at the ELEPHANT of all Thai restaurants, but when I got there... it was too busy.  So the wife and I shuffled next door to this gem.  I overheard this used to be \"Yoshi's\" which kind of makes sense.  Its the same Japanese style bowls, but oh-so-much better.  First off, they have pictures of their dishes plastered all over their walls and doors.  They all look good but then I heard an angel and she steered my wicked eyes toward the holy grail of dishes... Bulgoki.  I was overwhelmed.  I grabbed my wife's shoulder to avoid dropping to my knees in praise to the Japanese Bowl gods.  Lucky for me my wife is young and strong or I would have taken her down with me.  I, of course, order the Bulgoki and my wife orders the Spicy Teriyaki Chicken.  My wife grabs a table outside and I grab a pomegranite and jasmine iced tea and as many napkins as my miniature hands could carry (in preparation for the feast).  The wait was nil.  If it had been any shorter of a wait, time would be going backwards and I would have been dining with Socrates. Thankfully, I was still with my wife and I joined her at our table.  Her Chicken was too spicy for our liking, but we both liked the Bulgoki. DUH!  Anyway, this place is rockin'  To sum it up, the wait was great and the dish was delish.  BTW Chris,  Its spelled with a G not a K! Like this \"BULGOGI\"."}
{"text":"This place use to be an almost daily lunch experience for me not long ago, but staff turnover and crappy service pretty much drove me away. The food is good, but who has time to wait for the sloth boy behind the counter, to finally getting around to bagging my order. Talk about extremely unmotivated. He was more interested in neatly laying out napkins and putting one fortune cookie and a plastic fork on each napkin in preparation for some epic lunch rush, than putting my order in the bag and handing it to me. It wasn't like they were busy. Two of us waiting for our food. Guess I will continue bringing my lunch rather than dropping $10 on decent food but horrible service."}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt. Happy with the Teriyaki Chicken bowl. Good amount of chicken. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"The bowls are great, but the specials aren't that good. If you want a good teriyaki chicken with vegis white or brown rice then it's pretty good place. They've gotten a little cheap on the cups and plates lately, hope they change back.  Still nice people and quick service."}
{"text":"One of my downtown lunch spots, nice alternative casual place."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. I would go here again if I felt like having just some simple noodles in soup and didn't mind paying a higher price for it."}
{"text":"Very dependable food and quick service.  I really like the salmon bowl  and the kobe beef bowl."}
{"text":"Food tasted alright but my coworker and i got sick the first time we tried this place...thought it was a one time thing and tried it again about a month later. I got sick AGAIN!!!! Something is not clean about this place...because i have a tank of a stomach"}
{"text":"$5 Fridays are such a great deal!  I can't believe I haven't frequented this place before yesterday.  We stopped in and enjoyed a teriyaki bowl and a dynamite bowl with veggies - so fresh and tasty!  The staff is super friendly and helpful too!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Yasda Bento since finding a hair in my rice last year, but a co-worker told me this place was under new ownership. What a difference! The place got a complete makeover. It's clean, inviting and offers a lot of seating. I ordered the spicy ramen soup and it's excellent. Was excited to get a side of rice along with my order. The soup is HUGE - great deal on dishes."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out! Loved it. Had the Yakisoba Bowl and it was delicious! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Another quick lunch day downtown. Small, crowded place at lunchtime in downtown Phoenix. People sitting and eating, standing and waiting for take out and others ordering food. Not a large variety on the menu. Did not have much time and was going back to office I was at to eat once I got my order. Choose a large fried rice and an Arizona tea. The order taker, gave the order into a microphone to the kitchen that was about two feet behind him. I chatted with some other patrons. My name was called and I paid for my order, a bit over $5. Got back to the office, the bag contained a plastic container of fried rice, but no drink.  Strike ONE, the bowl of fried rice consisted of rice ( fried a bit) with three pieces of carrot and 4 peas Strike TWO, I added a packet of hot mustard and one of soy but this could not save a rather dreary dish that basically was a bowl of white rice and a couple pieces of frozen vegetables. To be truthful, a burger from one of the name fast food places would have probably been better.....and I would have gotten my drink ! My choice for lunch, Strike THREE."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. The counter help has difficulty taking accurate orders without customer help. The soda machine is the freestyle type which is useless if the flavored syrups aren't restocked (which they haven't been for the 2 years I've been going here.)"}
{"text":"$5 Fridays will have you walking out the door with a regular sized bowl of Chicken Teriyaki, and that includes the tax. If you like it spicy, you can get the Dynamite Chicken Bowl!"}
{"text":"We happened across this joint for lunch during Phoenix Comicon.  Overall, this place was a good price for value. I ordered the Bulgogi Beef bowl and found that it was full of flavor (with a little bit of a kick!) and was a bit more food than I was prepared for, which is never a bad thing. Unlimited soda refills, fortune cookie, and a great staff that effectively communicated why my meal was coming after my friends' was a good plus too. My three-star rating is simply a reflection of what I consider a standard decent meal and good service."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab lunch downtown.  They are fast and its good.  Can't beat the $5 Friday specials.  Good thing I go out for lunch on Friday's!  :)  I had the Dynamite Chicken and it was flavorful.  Would like to have gotten some extra spicy condiment, because I really like it spicy, but they were out of small containers cups.  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"This place was overall amazing! I dream about their Yakisoba & SUPER CHEAP gyoza.  I have been anticipating trying this place out & finally caught them open with my sister. -1  because theyre not open more days & longer hours & no bento boxes (which was a bit decieving) The spot is small but the service was on point fast & easy. You feel like your in another world or a busier city but its cute & comforting. It gives Downtown Phoenix character, which it needs more of. More life. Great Japanese lunch joint"}
{"text":"The food came out fast and was surprisingly good. I had the spicy ginger shrimp and there was a lot of shrimp in it, which I loved. The only complaint I have is that the seating area was cramped and looked like it hadn't been thoroughly wiped down in a on time. Maybe from this point, the food will be ordered to go."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. The meal was delivered very fast and hot. I had the Kobe Beef and it was yummy.  I will be ordering again since they are so fast and convenient."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Yasda Bento before, but they had a Groupon offer so I purchased it because it looked good. Unfortunately, I was not aware at the time that the restaurant is only open for the morning and lunch - from about 10-2pm...Found that out the hard way by going there one evening to find the restaurant closed. Luckily, I found a way to make it there for lunch another time so I could use my Groupon. And I was very impressed! First off, the Groupon was for $30-worth of food...which goes a long way here! I purchased 3 entrees and a couple side items. So, very reasonably priced. The food was great. And the staff was friendly and accomodating. My only suggestion is that they make it very well advertised (on their website and other web pages) that they are only open in the morning/lunch hours."}
{"text":"Good quick lunch downtown.  I recently (July 08) served on a jury, and ate here everyday (4x).  I'm a sucker for rice bowl Japanese, what can I say?  Better then the typical Kyoto Bowl or Tokyo Express (the usual Phoenix rice bowl chains)  Interesting menu choices, mostly clean, and quick service.  I enjoyed the spicy teriyaki and the edamame.    Don't expect any ambiance, and I think it's only open for lunch, anyway."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I just paid $8 for 15cent ramen. I paid extra for chicken that i ended up picking all the pieces out and threw them away. They were hard and chewing and just grossed me out. Thankfully i grabbed some green onion to throw in because there are no veggies like most places have that serve ramen. I've given this place two or three chances and have been very disappointed every time."}
{"text":"Food is fresh, fast and inexpensive....very convenient to city hall which is where I work.  But right in the middle of eating, the worker took out a wet mop with PINE SOL and mopped the floor.  I almost had to leave the fumes were so strong but I notice many people covering their noses and some leaving....not the smartest thing I've seen in a restaurant in the middle of their busiest time of day."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to go for lunch. Cane with a friend; she ordered the teriyaki chicken and I ordered the special of the day, which was tepenyaki udon with chicken, veggies, and gyoza. Food was very good, a little too much sauce, but over all delicious! Lunchtime rush is no joke though, so food took a bit to come out to us but we didnt have anywhere we needed to be so we didnt mind. Definitely, will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Place is nice, interior is blah but food is what matters. I ordered chicken yakisoba and while noodles were okay, chicken was just fantastic. I wanted to order bulgogi as well, but they were out, 1 star off for that. Staff is nice, place is clean, it was packed 30 mins after opening, price is right. Great for lunch or a quick breakfast if you don't like breakfast food, like me. Will visit again for bulgogi in question"}
{"text":"I thought the food was yummy and the service was average. I will be going back for more! I also thought \"melissa g's\" comment below was incredibly racist and unhelpful. Shame on her."}
{"text":"I come here often and get one dish, so my review is a bit limited.   Udon Chicken Noodle soup.  I love it.   Now here is an example of how I am easy to please, I think...cause a coworker told me about Udon soup they had in California, and it made what I eat here sound like high school culinary class food.  But, I still like Yasda's.   The broth, the chicken, and the noodles are all very very tasty to me.  There is a little fried tempura piece of...uhm...something on top, which I personally like how it gets all soggy for me to eat with the soup.  And they give you a side of white rice to soak everything up if you'd like - and its a nice amount of rice. Nothing special.  At all.  But it does me good on the colder days at lunch.   And I like the service.  First time I came here, I didn't have cash for a drink.  The lady slid me a cup on the sly:)  There's two of them that usually work the counter and they are always very friendly. Now, I will admit the layout inside is jacked up.  When it gets busy, the line wraps around a chunk of tables smack dab in the middle.  So you got people trying to eat while folks are hovering over them, talking and letting drops of saliva fly out....ok, i'll stop.  Then there's a bunch of tables on the right side of the place too close together.  I like to sit at the table against the window to people watch, and deal with the least of the crowdiness.  The drink and condiment stations are too close together and its a dance-off trying to get your chili garlic while someone else is trying to get a coke.  Also, their sushi options are so limited that they shouldn't even have it on the menu.  But...I dunno, I really like the place.  Its where I go when I can't decide, and when I'm having a downer of a day.  I'm going to try other dishes...eventually...maybe...probably not:)"}
{"text":"The employees were super nice and the food was awesome. Waited no time at all to get my food. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl and a small miso soup!"}
{"text":"I love going here,  I love the teriyaki chicken with veggies or the Kobe beef with broccoli and spicy teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and the quality of the food has gone down and the prices up.  I received my lunch today (cold), the chicken breast was minimal and it was completely tasteless!  Very disappointed.  With all of the competition they should be worried.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Looks like this place took a few menu items away. Now it's pretty standard terayaki chicken bowl place.  I had an egg roll with my lunch and they gave me a packet of sweet and sour sauce, blah.    Overall I like this place, but now it's just standard stuff. Not as exciting as it once was."}
{"text":"I hate to be a meanie, but the Korean ramen tasted like instant noodles I could make at home. I'll give this place another shot though. The guy had mentioned that there were $5 chicken bowls on Fridays."}
{"text":"I'm in disbelief a place like this is in business and I'm even more in disbelief I ate some of their food... Yasda is the dirtiest joint I have ever been to! They are not deserving to even allude that they serve Japanese food as those places are always super clean.  Being in need of some comfort food, I got a chicken  udon soup. Firstly, it was served in a flat container; secondly, the meat was anything BUT chicken (see picture), thirdly it had zero veggies, no fish cake, no scallions, nothing, nada, zilch. Lastly, for $7.21 the portion was tiny, something that did not matter as the concoction the owners of this place call udon was gross and I only tried a bite & a sip. The fortune cookie that I put my last hope in was stale.  The guy behind the counter takes container lids with his bare hands, touching the inside and he grabs forks by the part that would go into a person's mouth. The same hands he takes the money with, touches his hair and fixes his glasses. So gross!"}
{"text":"Gets very busy at lunch. Not bad food and price but definitely not Korean, except for Bulgolgi bowl. Get take out, you can eat if you have a seat and dine in is mainly served in take out containers without lids anyway."}
{"text":"My lord it was so bland. I couldn't even taste the soy sauce.   Calling this place \"Bento\" is quite frankly, an insult to what a bento should really be.   I am disappointed, it was over priced for what it was, and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food was \"good\" and \"flavorful\" (msg). The place smelled like B.O. The sushi was grocery store quality and cold. They could do with a surprise visit from the health inspector. If everything cost two dollars less, complaints could be overlooked."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for lunch if you work downtown.  It's inexpensive and depending on your choice can be very healthy.  Warning on the large sized portions though...you'd better be hungry as they are large.  When you walk in the menu is on the wall and there are pictures of the various dishes.  I find that helpful in ethnic restaurants if I don't know what words mean.  I had the yaki soba and it was serviceable.  The best part was that it was really fast.    I'd say it's not a great place to take a group.  Most of the tables seat only two or four people.    But again, it's great for a quick, healthy bite.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place pretty often since I'm literally 2mins walking distance away, I always get the Korean Ramen Noodles and it never disappoints. If your looking for something yummy and quick check this place out and also their prices are really convenient."}
{"text":"MENU Definitely former Yoshi's-esque.  Japanese fast food at it's ... not finest but well, at it's normal.  I would echo that it's a bit above Yoshi's.  It's got the same bowl with a variety of options thing going on and it works.  Something for everyone and pictures if you don't know what the #$%& is going on.  There are a variety of options, including vegetarian that have ample fresh-looking vegetables.  The Udon is pretty decent, relatively authentic and full of noodles.  It's a little bland though, but they have plenty of doctoring spices which I very much appreciated.  I like to be creative.  I got it with the chicken and while that adds to the filling quotient, it's basically the same low-quality dark meat that is in the Yoshi's teriyaki bowls.  They do have the white meat option for other bowls though so they may accomodate you on the Udon.  Yakisoba is also tasty.  Rice is well-done and I always find myself eating more if it than I normally would.  I wouldn't say it was super-cheap as per other reviews (the udon was a little high in my opinion) but it's affordable.    CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY This place is dirty. When I was there, it smelled... off.  It wouldn't take much for them to make this a better experience by cleaning up the counters, polishing up the menu and generally putting some \"shine\" on stuff.  It's dingy and I prefer to eat outside.  I'm a neat freak about restaurant though so... take it for what it is.     SERVICE Quick, efficient, functional- counter style, not much more to say to that.  You can get in and out and get your lunch done in a half an hour.      ATMOSPHERE See above- pretty much yuck.  Overall, quick, decent, but eat outside or take it to go."}
{"text":"The service was good. The place was just starting to jump with the downtown lunch crowd but the order wait wasn't long and the food was hot. But that's all I have to say about the food. The egg rolls and gyoza were soggy. There was hard, either over done or under done rice, in the curry bowl. Even though there was no chili pepper warning,  the hibachi bowl was too spicy to enjoy. The noodles were Chinese, not Japanese. IMHO too much confusion in Asian food. Japanese, Korean, or Chinese? All done average, not stood out."}
{"text":"I would go somewhere else.....The food tasted like it was purchased in the frozen food section and reheated. I got the teriyaki chicken bowl and it was average. My friend got the Korean ramen and it was literally just noodles and broth. The broth had a decent spice but the noodles seemed as though they came from a top ramen package, they threw out the seasoning packet and then were over boiled."}
{"text":"Yasda is a good spot for lunch. Ever since new management the place has friendlier staff and better food. I love to eat lunch here on Fridays because they have a $5 Teriyaki Chicken Bowl Special! That's a good deal for a nice portion lunch. Just today I decided to ask for easy brown rice and extra veggies and they were able to do that for me. Overall the food is good and for $5 you can't beat a great deal or lunch! Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"If you are downtown Phoenix this is a great location! Seating inside and out, reasonably price and great food! They also deliver! A must try place!"}
{"text":"Today I tried Yasda Bento for my first time, even though I have been working downtown for over 2 years.  I enjoyed the selections and prices on the menu so I finally decided to try it. I was advised it would be best to call my order in ahead of time since it was about prime lunch time for downtown. (around 12:15pm)  I opted for the Curry Chicken which is a favorite of mine at many other restaurants so I thought I would try theirs.  It is definitely a different version of curry chicken than I have been used to. I consider it more of a \"Curry stew\".  I also wasn't too keen on the charbroiled chicken (which I didn't notice in the description when I ordered so that was my fault).  The charbroiled flavor gave it a much different taste to the curry and vegetables than I would've liked which is why it had more of a stew feel. The dish was good but if you're expecting a typical light curry sauce, you won't get it with this dish.  I do plan on going back though and trying other items. It's close if you work downtown and I do recommend calling your order ahead of time if it's during peak lunch hours to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"How could it be? I have yet to review Yasda? Next to Baja Fresh this is another one of my relatively regular lunch fall back spots.   Typical of most of it's neighbors they get hit by the lunch rush but handle it well. I love the pictures on the wall as you wait in line to order enticing you every step of the way.   Their small bowls are plenty of food for the average (I usually have left overs) but they offer a large bowl for those more hearty appetites. Their food is good, always spicy and flavorful. Nothing stellar, very Yoshi's-like. Their steamed veggies are some of my favorite. Always make sure to stop at the little condiment table on the far right to get your soy, chili sauce and scallions to add the extra flavor to your meal.   Prepared fresh and quickly I can rely on Yadsa for a quick quality lunch without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"When I crave this place, I really crave it bad--other times I can go without it for months.  Today, I am craving it, so I am going to write a review about Yasda Bento.  Like David S. said, there isn't a full service Japanese restaurant downtown so this is basically your only choice.  It's a decent choice, it will do.  I seem to be drawn to the Veggie and terriyaki chicken or salmon bowls with rice ot just veggies, depends on the mood.  I am happy with it.  It's not really mouthwatering or \"sooooooooooooo good\".  But it'll do for the work day for lunch.  I am craving the salmon and rice bowl today."}
{"text":"The one thing I really liked about this place is that it was super cheap.  I ordered a bowl of teriyaki chicken, veggies and rice and it was under $5.  Unfortunately about halfway through my bowl I got kind of tired of their teriyaki sauce and started to realize how overcooked my veggies were.  So I managed to satisfy my hunger but I had no desire to finish the entire bowl.  I'd give a few other items a try, maybe the spicy teriyaki is a little better?"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice, sorely disappointed both times. If you're looking for Asian food, this is not the place to go. I tried what they called Kobe beef. I'm from Kobe so I know what it *should* taste like, and believe me, it does not even qualify as \"fake Kobe beef.\" The tenderness and juiciness of Kobe beef just is nowhere in sight (or taste). I'm not going to even bother commenting on the other \"Japanese\" food because they're not really Japanese.  I also tried the Korean BBQ bowl. I love bulgogi, kalbi, yukhue, etc. Whatever this was is NOT korean bbq. The marinade they used had far too much sugar and not enough garlic and ginger. The beef was tough too, but the sugary taste was what killed this dish. It tastes exactly like the person cooking it did not know how it's supposed to taste. $8+ for this bowl is REALLY not worth it. I wouldn't pay $5.00 for it. I could eat much better tasting food at Blue Fin for less money. It's really frustrating.  What I also don't understand is why it's called Yasda BENTO. I went in expecting to be able to buy a bento and there are NO bento boxes whatsoever. A bento usually is a box with a variety of foods (usually balanced and somewhat healthy, although you can choose to have a completely unhealthy bento of deep fried foods on rice, which, again, this place does not have). If a restaurant is called \"**** Bento\", I expect them to have bentos.   The fried gyoza was OK. They're as good as the ones my kid makes.  As for parking, you have to pay for street parking if you go by car. I've concluded that this place is not worth driving to. Actually, even if I was within walking distance, I'd skip it. I have never been so disappointed in food like I have in this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is awful. If I wanted cup of noodles for lunch, I could make it myself. What's worse is that the employees announce that the food is hot and fresh. Instant noodles are not fresh. Also, my \"Korean\" noodles came with a side of brown rice. Noodle soups should not be accompanied by rice."}
{"text":"Often I complain that there's no place to eat downtown when I should realize that there's no place *new* to eat within walking distance of my office. However, I've been trying to establish a rotation of restaurants that will swap things up and help avoid stagnating dining experiences. This is where Yasda Bento comes in handy. They have a good selection of rice bowls (the spicy chicken is pretty gnarly!) and some premade \"sushi\" which I haven't gotten yet. [As a side note, their sushi sells for half price after 2 p.m. I go to lunch at 1:30 so haven't been tempted to get this deal.]  I always seem to get \"just full\" off their meals. Any less and I'd be cranky by 5:30; any more and I wouldn't be able to finish it all and it would up residing in the office fridge for a week or a month.  Overall, Yasda Bento is a good deal for a good meal."}
{"text":"Eh -- no.   I stopped here for quick take-out one day while at work. They had no sushi at all (even though it's on the menu), and the menu itself isn't laid out very well for understanding what they have/what's included.  I wasn't there to eat onsite, but good thing -- very little inside seating.  The food wasn't all that good, and if the customer says \"to go\", then you should put utensils and napkins in the bag for me. The place didn't seem very clean either.   Just not a good experience. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to come back and get the Korean ramen noodles again!....and this time...it was too salty :(   The service is excellence. The cashier was super friendly. But the noodle soup was so salty I drink so much water throughout the day.   Disappointed ...."}
{"text":"went here on a break from Jury Duty once. it was ok. nothing memorable. i was just reminded of this place because i ate at Thai Elephant the other night and its right next door.  food, typical take out teriyaki, absolutly nothing special. nothing memorable, and will not miss this place much. holds nothing compared to Blue Fin, sorry Yasda Bento. needs improvement.   maybe a signiture dish...because just spicy versions of the norm isn't going to cut it."}
