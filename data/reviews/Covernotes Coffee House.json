{"text":"I love exploring different cafes. After discovering Covernotes on Yelp, I decided to swing by the coffee house when I was in the area. The place is a decent size - there were tables around the sides and in the back. For a weekday afternoon, most of the tables were surprisingly occupied. I ordered a cappuccino - it was okay, nothing wow - I wasn't tempted enough to try the other foods. There were many shelves throughout with books of different genres. I found an interesting read while I was there. Did wish they had more comfortable chairs though."}
{"text":"The coffee here is great. I loved their tea selection as well. The seating is cozy with a library feel to it. They have lots of books in the shelves. A must try!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing change from the so-so coffee shops I've been to so far in this area. 
Pros- Good location, spacious, artsy ambiance, lots of books you can read while having your coffee, good variety of loose leaf teas, great customer service!

Cons- No cozy seating area (which would go great with the theme of this place!)"}
{"text":"Saturday lunch and this is the only place open worth eating at.  In fact probably the only place worth eating at period."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the place is trying to be.  The ambiance is a little off.  A coffee shop that serves sandwiches,crepes and salads. All of this amongst an old used bookstore feel. The food was okay but it takes a long time to get it. The washrooms are sub par and had no way to dry my hands. I think quicker service and attention to detail can improve the experience."}
{"text":"This is really a one-of-a-kind café, at least in Richmond Hill. I came here with a friend when it was still cold and snowy out, and it had such a nice atmosphere, very quaint and antique-looking. It reminded me a lot of the \"pioneer\" houses from elementary school field trips, and it had the same old wood smell (which I love).

I would have liked more seating options since the only available table was very close to a table with another couple on it, while it was empty enough to allow overhearing other conversations very easily, so it made us feel a little uncomfortable to speak freely.

We ordered a Nutella and strawberry crêpe and it was one of the best crêpes I've ever had. They serve plain yogurt on the side which was a genius addition since crêpes usually end up being so sweet that I can't finish them, and this sour addition made it perfect.

The biggest complaint I had was the temperature. Because it was the middle of winter and because this is a free-standing building and an old one without very advanced insulation, I guess heating it sufficiently was difficult. Both of us felt chilly most of the time we were there. Our table beside the window was especially drafty, so after we finished the crêpes, we went to the area at the back where all the books are which is probably the best thing about Covernotes and just browsed the books for a while. They're pretty overpriced for second-hand books, but I don't think their main purpose there was for selling, which suited us perfectly.

I will definitely come back here again, you don't find many places nearby that are so enjoyable to just spend some time in."}
{"text":"All around great independent coffee shop. Hard to find something even close to this anywhere in Richmond Hill/Thornhill."}
{"text":"This is a nice coffee house.  It's a nice setup with book stacks in the back, kids books keep our one year old occupied.  The service is friendly but very very slow.  Food is good but no great.  There are various gluten free options."}
{"text":"I don't particularly enjoy peeing in the dark, and I seldom had to do it without first situating myself in the outdoors. So when Covernotes forced me to do this, I was of course, very uneasy.

My friend Lucy came back from Chicago for the weekend, I haven't seen her for almost two years, so I went out of my way for simple coffee.  The idea of a old bookstore turned cafe sounded intriguing.
A sizable free parking lot at the rear, ramp ascending to the entrance.  Ah, grandeur, the perks of the having a business way out the constant squeeze of the city.
Natural light upon entrance, this was to be good.
We approach the counter, and we were very kindly notified of the power outage.  
Suddenly, the natural lighting didn't feel as comforting as a moment ago, and we only had the choice warm coffee from the dispenser. 
I drove fifty bloody kilometres for lukewarm coffee from a NONE FANCY dispenser. 

Very spacious real estate with books resting strategically throughout the cafe, and mainly shelved on the....shelves..at the rear corner of the room, and also the humble library at the very rear of the cafe.  
We took our seat at the front, not to interrupt the readers at the back with our mingling.
The coffee station with the three helpless baristas was considerably sized for a independent cafe.  I would imagined it having great capabilities on days with electricity.  They were however, able to sell me a cookie, as I had just enough change to pay, and also leave a very 'Asian' tip.  Again, outage to blame.

Our conversation eventually, and inevitably landed on the topic of the history of China, and just so happens resting on the window sill were two books titled \"History of China.\"  I was very impressed by the resourcefulness of this inanimate place.
Surely, I could imagine begin able to reference from books during a debate, just like the ancient dinosaurs of the generations preceded the internet.  Gawd, what an exciting and adventurous thought!  How scholarly!
Surely no need for electricity to carry out such magnificent fantasy.

The place just felt smart, and local.  
The staff were very helpful in aspects not involving the usage of electricity. 
The company of my friend was well enough to triumph over our inauspicious timing, and for a cafe of such specific purpose, there were no hipsters!
LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION..!!


Sooo..when I needed to use the washroom, I was plunged into total darkness.
I took out my cell phone and placed it on the sink, but then immediately realised that I needed to direct the light towards the 'target area', so with one hand I pointed my smart phone towards the area of interest, and with the other I aimed as best as I could.  Thankfully, disaster adverted, as I am no stranger to the darkness.  
That's as literary as I'm gonna get."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Yelp while I was looking for a place for breakfast. Came here and was amazed at the environment. This restaurant looked like a church from the outside. Inside of the restaurant was not decorated as a high end cafe. It looked like a mixture of a library and an art gallery. I chose to sit in front of a big window at a unique wooden made table. 

I ordered a Chai Tea Latte and a Roasted Chicken and Brie Sandwich. The Chai Tea Latte looked good when it came. I believed that chocolate powder was sprinkled throughout the surface of the Latte. It had a rich flavour of Chai Tea but it's a bit too sweet to my personal taste. 

The sandwich came shortly after. It was stuffed with layers of roasted chicken, lettuce, slices of cucumber, tomato and Brie cheese etc. On the side, there were a strawberry, and chips placed on the side on top of another leaflet of lettuce. Since the Sandwich was toasted and so it was crunchy with every bite. I really had to open my mouth wide to take a bite. It's really delicious. 

It's a nice and relaxing breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Covernotes is a perfect spot for a Sunday morning coffee and a quiet read. 

The place has just enough seating to not get over-crowded, which is more than I can say for the average Second Cup or Starbucks in town. It's clean, bright and unique atmosphere is comforting, especially in the winter. 

My last visit to Covernotes was the first time I stopped in for lunch. I was desperately trying to find somewhere to do my payroll and of course at 12pm on a Sunday a spot in a local coffee shop is hard to find. 

It was freezing outside, I had already driven around for half an hour and I was hungry and getting very grumpy. So, I decided to give it a chance.  

Normally when I'm in this mood I would just go home to avoid being with the rest of society, of course for all your sakes. Ya, you're welcome. But here the staff are so sweet and bubbly that they immediately improved my mood. 

Once I set up my work station, I went to order. I was surprised by the types of food they served; lattes, crepes, sandwiches, soup, salad and desserts. They have an awesome selection. Since I already knew their coffee was excellent, I started with that, and then I ordered the chipotle chicken wrap.

The wrap came in about 10 minutes. Decent time since it was made to order. It came with a few slices of pineapple and quinoa salad on the side. The wrap was very good, it had great spice and the chicken was nice and tender. I was very happy with my lunch choice. 

I plan to head back to Covernotes soon to try a crepe and a spicy hot chocolate, which unfortunately I saw they offered after I already ordered coffee. And, I also plan on searching through their used book selection in the back, all of which are pre-loved and for sale. 

The only down side to Covernotes, especially when going to do work, is that the wireless is finicky and there are no outlets to plug laps tops in. Next time I will make sure mine is fully charged.    

So if you're looking for a new coffee spot, I definitely recommend here. Stray off the beaten Starbucks path and try something new. Give back to a good cause by trying some local coffee and supporting small local businesses. 

Trust me, while all the black-rim glasses, floppy hat and cashmere scarf wearing \"worldly\" kids are sitting at Starbucks, you could be sitting at Covernotes thinking locally and giving back to your community."}
{"text":"Coffee, sandwiches and books. The coffee and food is nothing spectacular, and the prices aren't particularly cheap either, but the place is cute and it's a neat little place to stop by in the afternoon. Their lunches are pretty good, if you work in the area."}
{"text":"The fact that I am now 4 weeks sober (of coffee that is) hurts my heart. Especially knowing that one of the best independent coffee shops in the GTA is serving it up and I cannot partake.

I like to frequent this spot weekdays when I need a place close to home to get some work done. It likely has the best location in all of Richmond Hill, proudly situated within the old Richmond hill school house at Yonge and Wright street. I'm also surprised that given this prime location it isn't busier, folks if you're looking for a great cuppa-joe I highly recommend you stop in here for some (they roast their own beans just 20 minutes away in Newmarket).

Everything about their menu is fresh, gourmet and fantastic. It's all freshly made to order and done with care. While the Smoked cheddar and bacon grilled cheese is wonderful and a comfort food fave, I'm especially a fan of their vegan quinoa, and their made to order crepes. Although more difficult to make I encourage you to order the Gatsby with egg and ham inside. In addition to their fresh lunch fare they also have backed in house goodies like muffins, scones and gluten free options!

I'm awarding Covernotes 3.5 stars (rounded up) on account of the fact that after nearly a year of promises they still have not offered their own WiFi and request that guest piggyback off the nearby Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts signal, which is patchy at the best of times. Also, if you're looking for plugs, good luck that situation is extremely limited.

Final note, if you're looking for used books, Covernotes derives its clever name from the fact that they offer thousands of second hand books for sale throughout their store. You actually never know what you will find here!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was pleasantly surprised when I was greeted by a group of singers dressed up in Christmas costume perfectly harmonizing carols. Tis the season to be jolly!

This place is like a mini library, and I can envision it being a good place to study. However since it's holiday season and also a weekend, it was quite busy and got noisy later in the afternoon (some people were likely grabbing a coffee before a show at the performing arts centre). Ordered a strawberry scone, which was alright. Baked goods are normally not so good for les arteries, but I can tell they went light on the butter. They have a wide variety of different loose leaf teas. The pomegranate vanilla lemur tea is very fragrant and pleasant. Would come again."}
{"text":"Gave me a free coffee and I was there just to drop off some stuff.
Staff was very friendly, place looks clean.
I passed by this place every day and never knew it was a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Good Stuff 
- very cozy and quiet 
- sorted library 
- plenty of small tables for 1-2 people
- couple sets of large tables (I remember 2 or 3)
- hidden gem
- 2 entrances lol
- kind and helpful service 
- comfortable seating, atmosphere, etc
- clean bathrooms 
- perfect lighting (not too dim)

Grr Moments
- the water pitcher and glasses were filthy 
- found a dead bug 'swimming' inside the water 
- the table weren't cleaned (only happened once though)
- the expensive menu haha (can't be really helped)
- drinks aren't worth paying a lot of money for
- my Iced Tea tasted like water
- Lemonade was mediocre and was a bit less than Minute - maid's quality and taste(s)

Overall worth studying and going there but don't buy from their menu."}
{"text":"Very cozy, cute cafe if you're looking to get away from the crowded and predictable franchise coffee shops. It's a very versatile place that suits people looking to independently study or socialize. Food and drinks can run a little expensive but they have healthy and unique food options which generally come at a price. As far as taste and quality go, it really depends on the staff. I've been both satisfied and disappointed with the same meal on separate occasions. The only reason for 3 stars is because of the inconsistency of the service and quality of the food/drinks. More often than not the food/drinks are great and arrive quickly, but other days it's a subpar experience. Overall it's a great place to grab a drink/dessert and admire the local artwork and unique book selection. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I dropped by for a quick christmas gift, and they were happy to provide a gift bag for the occassion. the gift recipient says the coffee was some of the best he's ever had (their Columbian whole bean), so I may have to stop in again to verify!"}
{"text":"Just NORTH of Richmond Hill's Centre for the Performing Arts there is a beautiful 2-storey historical red-brick building standing on it's own with a black banner and NEON green lettering \"Covernotes\" that says Tea and Coffee House, so I HAD to go check it out.

It was just as CUTE inside if I am allowed to say that.  It reminds me of Green Merchants near Leslieville or just a typical independent coffee shop near Kensington or Little Italy, so it's a nice SURPRISE to see something like Covernotes appear in the suburbs out of nowhere.

It is basically a USED bookstore with a Coffee & Tea shop inside while posting various art pieces that are for sale or just display.  I can definitely see myself study here if I live nearby as any other coffee shop within the radius is either Starbucks or Tim Hortons.

Locally, ORGANIC coffee by JP Lindsay Co(http://www.jplindsayco.ca).  There is a wall with various Teas for purchase as well as another wall with a few Coffees for retail.  I had the Single Espresso($1.95) and it was a light clean smooth flavour that definitely reminds me of organic coffees.  I also had the Cappucino($3.20) but it wasn't as good and it was almost a complete Latte as it was more milk than foam.

The young gentlemen and only person attending to the shop prepared my drink with LOTS of detail and even re-did the drink a second time, unfortunately he is still a young-hand on this matter but I can see his efforts and determination and that makes it worth a SECOND try for me sometime in the future.  He even brought both of my drinks to my table, that's SERVICE I've never seen before at a coffee shop.

I will STICK with coffee, espresso and TRY the TEAS as I noticed a great selection that peaked my interest with the combinations.  I would be happy to see this rarity of an independent coffee shop in the suburbs be able to serve the locals and in return the community can embrace this combination of Bookstore/Drink shop."}
{"text":"This coffee shop/used book store has a nice ambience. Their coffee is ok, but the baked goods are very dry and tasted stale."}
{"text":"I had an iced coffee (not on the menu and they had to compromise the syrup since they had no liquid sugar). It's rather expensive ($8.99 for a panini), but I guess I don't mind spending an extra buck for this bit of Richmond Hill-born coffee house (correct me if I'm wrong?). It's really authentic and I believe it is a part of the Richmond Hill identity, partly because it's very close to \"downtown\" Richmond Hill. 

When I went, there was a (weekly?) gathering of women who had booked the back room for a painting gathering. The room next to it was filled to the ceiling with new and used books. While waiting for my friend I browsed through them and the variety was quite vast. 

The intimacy of Covernotes draws me in, as it really seems like \"the neighbourhood coffee shop\", but I would not frequent the coffee shop.

For me, Williams Coffee Pub (in the Loblaws plaza northward) would be my go-to place for meetings over coffee with friends with a bonus being that it's closer to where I live. 

The quality of my coffee wasn't anything special either. Perhaps if Covernotes toned down the price I would come more, but alas."}
{"text":"I needed 40 corporate gift baskets so I thought why not deal locally and great coffee and treats is a great thing to get. Only problem no one answers the telephone ...ever...or even has voice mail...so I cannot buy this from them"}
{"text":"Really cute cafe! I like how it's also a mini library as well. I haven't had the chance to try out a lot of the items on their menu but the prices seem to be reasonable. The latte was okay, nothing too special. Overall, a very relaxing and cozy cafe."}
{"text":"Browsing in a cozy library of books while enjoying a cup of cappuccino is like the peanut butter & jelly combo for me, just so meant to be! I'm usually not a coffee shop bum but a book cafe is starting to change my mind.. 

If you are ever around the area and looking for a place to get absorbed and relax for a couple of hours, Covernotes is definitely worth checking out. There are great finds here for all the fiction lovers out there but also nonfiction gems sprinkled in the collection like 'the 500 hidden secrets of Barcelona' which I indulged myself with. 

In addition to their fragrant coffee and super moist carrot cake, I like that they price their books at a couple of bucks each in case you are unable to tear yourself away and want to bring one home. This was such a nice Saturday treat!"}
{"text":"After my early morning work, my wife suggested to try out this restaurant for breakfast. We had never been to restaurant before and so it was like an adventure. In fact, this is an extraordinary restaurant, the architectural design of restaurant building looked like a church. As I stepped inside, it was a total different story. It looked like a library to me. There bookshelves with books and magazines as well as paintings hung on almost all sides of the wall with price tags. So was this a cafe or an art museum? I wondered. Looking at the menu on the wall, the restaurant served a wide variety of coffees and lattes.  It also offered grilled sandwiches and other breakfast choices. I ordered a cup of Chai Tea Latte and a Roasted Chicken and Brie Sandwich.

The cup of Chai Tea Latte arrived first. The surface of the latte was slightly decorated with sprinkle of chocolate powder. It looked good and certainly tasted delicious!! Shortly after, the grilled sandwich arrived. There was a few chips and a strawberry on the side of the sandwich. The sandwich looked like a double decker and it was impressive. I could taste many different ingredients were stuffed inside the sandwich on top of the brier cheese and the roasted chicken. My mouth was full and couldn't stop chewing and biting. Please note that this restaurant was not like a high end cafe or restaurant but the quality of food and the interesting design of the restaurant captured my appetite as well as my heart."}
{"text":"Covernotes is a magnet in the (very) slowly gentrifying downtown, Richmond Hill. It's kind of an awesome cross between an old school library(they also sell used books) and Green Beanery. I've had teas and hot chocolate here, since I'm no longer hooked on coffee. 

The hot chocolate is made with Ghirardelli chocolate and it's heavenly and super rich. The teas are great but not as uber-concentrated as I prefer them, -or maybe my caffeine addiction isn't quite over yet. 

Of the few times I've visited, it's been pretty empty which can be nice as the staff is welcoming and if they had wifi I'm sure they'd get more traffic.

Study/Work friendly? Yes. No wifi, though."}
{"text":"A lovely place to enjoy a fine coffee or tea while you browse some used books. Nice nooks to sit in and chill out. I really like the decor (renovated heritage building). Great owner and staff - always a friendly chat. Enjoy the amazing croissants, but please, leave one for me."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better than it is now. The food now is often stale, and the coffee is NEVER fresh anymore :( Considering they charge $2 for a coffee and $3+ for any baked good, this is not fair. Once I ordered a \"fresh\" iced tea and it was SO stale....felt like it was in the fridge for 2 days, but I paid $4 for one normal sized glass. 

With that being said, the place has a great ambiance, very cozy and nice if you want to sit and get some work done. I personally love that this is not a huge chain like Starbucks, so I continue to come here when I have work to do. 

The staff is always VERY friendly!"}
{"text":"The place is never too busy. If you can't find a table in the main area, there is a semi-private room in the back with a large table boardroom-style.

Most of the store is taken up by bookcases, floor to ceiling, or used books. I've picked up a lot of great bargains here over the years.

Coffee, lattes, teas and some pastries. Everything is good quality.

There is ample parking around the back but good luck finding a spot if there is an event at the centre for the performing arts.

They don't have their own WiFi but you can usually mooch that of the arts centre next door. 

The small room in the back is frequently used by local business networking and community groups. It is probably good for up to 10-12 people."}
{"text":"First time going - a lot more spacious on the inside than it seems from the outside. The place was really clean and I loved the wall with different tea jars. A lot of variety and it was cute. The tea I wanted was on the top shelf which was too high for any of my friends to reach so we choose something else... I ordered an iced tea latte. They told me that they didn't have any ice so they would use cold water and cold milk. The latté was super watery, barely any milk and made my stomach hurt for two days. I wouldn't mind going again, but I think I'd just go with a simple and plain tea."}
{"text":"What an awesome and quaint place in Richmond Hill. Brings some soul into a pretty cookie cut area. Relax, unwind, this is the kind of place you come to, to get away."}
{"text":"There is much room for improvement.  The idea of coffee and books and the vintage building feel is great.  The place is always TOO COLD.  I agree with another reviewer - it always looks dirty and disorganized.  Spend MONEY and hire a professional restaurant designer to get rid of mish-mash of equipment and untidily kept open shelving and coolers.  The large coffee is over $3 and too much IMO.  The food is only adequate and home-quality equipment vs. commercial equipment is used.... which has me suspect about eating it!  Young people work there and they only care about their friends, loud music and do not act with cleanliness top of mind.

UPDATE:  I visited again on a Monday recently.  Got there at 6pm.  There was 1 person working and she was run off her feet.  The SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE.  Asked her if my coffee was fresh, she said yes....  it tasted awful (from the thermos).  There was coffee spilled at the milk/cream station, there were no napkins, customers were waiting 15 minutes for coffee.  The girl on staff reminded everyone that came in that she was closing at 7pm.  One woman waited for her order until 7pm, only to find out the order was wrong.  She left empty-handed.  OH MY GOODNESS....   where are the owners?   CLEAN THE PLACE UP!  TRAIN YOUR STAFF!  SPEND SOME MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop/bookstore. Something you'd find in a hipster neighbourhood downtown with the prices to match. Coffee drinks are better than average, food is also good but again, prices reflect the quality and then some. The bookstore part is awesome and it's a great little cozy place to have coffee with a friend or just to hang out in a quiet spot."}
{"text":"3.5 *
Different, cozy old architecture glam meets antique vibe but not unique. 

I like they support/sell local artist from the pottery to art work on wall, the beans are small batch roasted and everything is made fresh. Prices are a tad more than Starbucks especially just a drip coffee here is $2.85/medium while $3 gets a tall latte at Starbucks! 

I Love their decaf Peruvian dark roast, so much I bought a pound for home and this is saying ALOT. 

It is hard to get parking behind if an event is running next door, great if you live nearby and can walk over. I came at 2pm on a weekday to chat with a friend and atmosphere felt like a library(no music, just a do not disturb feel) but on other nights they have more lively events going on. My friend has rented the back room for small private function which is neat. 
Mixed crowd from teens, trendy moms, to bookworm and a few odds and ends(tip jars are not free money for the public) 
Would come back if in area, but nothing worth the drive over for."}
{"text":"Covernotes is a refreshing transplant in Richmond Hill. There is certainly nothing like it in the area. It brings a dash of culture and sophistication to a town that is becoming more and more suburban."}
{"text":"No one can deny if I call it a mini library. Close to  local artist museum. Barista and owner Nancy was very friendly and she loved my ugly Christmas sweater. Yujie's banana split and my morning glory muffin were so good. Warm and fancy,"}
{"text":"Covernotes didn't really cover my coffee notes.  But mind u my review is solely on their coffee and that is the only thing I hve tried.  The coffee are very watery and the surprising thing is they even have grinded it fresh and  brewed it right away for me, but it still tasted awful.  The staffs don't seem to know what they are doing. It could be just the staff but don't think I want to come back again.  This place could be good for food abs snack but definitely not for coffee lovers, coffee lovers will find it greatly disappointed.  I would suggest the uptown folks try Better coffee and tea emporium on yonge and 19th Instead."}
{"text":"I frequent downtown Richmond Hill and Cover Notes is one of my fave spots.  A refreshing watering hole for cappuccinos or black teas, and for a book lover and art enthusiast like me it's a fine retreat.  A heritage landmark right next to the very contemporary Richmond Hill Center for the Performing Arts at the heart of the old downtown, it's a tree that stands tall for the town's artistic, musical, and intellectualculture.

Coffee and pastries are great and I enjoy it very much and I come here more for the vibe of the place.  They have the used books bookstore, Books on the Hill, and an art gallery of local and professional artists which paintings are also for sale and far from being mediocre.  You can spend hours reading the books from the shelf and sit yourself in a cozy nook at the backend of the room, or enjoy some light & air at the main dining where the paintings are.  A simplistic and cozy country interior with clean pastel palettes and old school architecture it's a quiet place to write, think, read, and be among artists and writers who are very warm and pleasant.  

This place will not blow you away like Starbucks would but it will impress you with its delectable charm and desirable simplicity."}
