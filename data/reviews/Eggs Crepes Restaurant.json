{"text":"We came here on Boxing Day morning and the place wasn't too busy. 

The waitress came by to take our order a couple of times before we decided and that was the end of her attentiveness. 

One of our guests asked for his meat side to be plated separately (does not eat pork and instead of ordering sausage as an extra we share it from his meal). I also asked for maple syrup with my French toast and another guest asked for water to drink.

After taking our order the waitress did not return and avoided eye contact. I literally did a two handed wave to get her attention for the water. 

When the food arrived it was mediocre and luke warm. 
The meat was plated on top of the eggs and no maple syrup. Then we couldn't get the waitress to understand what we meant about the sausage. She did take the plate away and bring it back with the meat separate, they did not replace the eggs.

Then had to chase down the waitress for more coffee, which ended up not being hot anyway. 

Would definitely not return."}
{"text":"Our favourite place for breakfast. We have been coming here for over 7 years! Love the food and service. It is also really nice that coffee or tea is always included with your breakfast entree."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place. Excellent customer service. The reason I only gave it a 4 star is because the eggs are a wee bit too small."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast during the week but busier on weekends. For a small establishment they have made good use of the space with plenty of tables as well as keeping the place very clean. The food is great with lots of choices. They also recently started offering free wifi so just ask for the password."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast in Ajax. The food is always good, and I love the fresh fruit that comes with the breakfast. Their home fries have a nice bit of flavour to them. This place has not equal."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by how good the food and service was, even on such a busy day as Father's Day. 

Had breakfast with a large group of family and still only took an hour in an out. 

The variety of what they offer is matched by the quality. Will be back next time we're in the area"}
