{"text":"The Best Mexican food that I have found since I have left Arizona. Great portions for the price, and the staff is fantastic and really helpful. I would recommend the Super Nachos or the Super Burro Texano. The SBT has a bit of everything - Shrimp, Chicken, Steak. Now if you want something small the reg burritos, tostadas are the way to go, but they are stuffed too."}
{"text":"Good food.   They aren't fond of you presenting coupons they post in the Brunswick Town Saver.  If you don't want people to use coupons don't post them in the book."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. I am a weekly regular and am always amazed at the great food and friendly service.  Who would have thought that Chicken Quesadillas could be improved upon!  Best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Great Mexican and local! Clean, great service, incredible presentation and very inexpensive. Definitely coming back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in brunswick by far! Best Mexican I've actually had anywhere! The chicken is always amazing with any meal. My favorite is the chicken quesadilla. The salsa is also wonderful! So while you wait for your food (which everything is freshly made so it does take a bit) it definitely takes some willpower to not fill up on a million warm and yummy chips!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican around!!! They let me create a meal that's not on the menu!! The guacamole and Queso are always fresh and tasty! Service is always fast and friendly! Very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the exact same menu as my favorite Mexican place in Seven Hills, Si Señor, just wish the service was the same. Located in a new strip mall type area in Brunswick, the restaurant is on the small side. The food was great, loved the fresh chips and salsa. The price point is amazing, for less than $15 I can have unlimited chips and salsa, a sampler of enchiladas, and a pop. The service once we received our food was non existent, which can be explained by the waitstaff having their backs turned to the customers. I understand the need to roll silverware into napkins and prepare things for the next day, but I used a lot of Tapatio hot sauce on my enchiladas (Enchiladas Supremas are amazing) and I really, really needed a refill that sadly never came. My suggestion...order out, or maybe check out Si Señor in Seven Hills."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Brunswick! The food is phenomenal. I always get the 3 chicken tacos (order #64). What I really like about it is that the chicken is grilled not shredded. It gives it a lot more flavor. Plus the price is great for the amount of food you get! Sometimes they even have it on special for cheaper. Highly recommend!! You can also call ahead for togo orders. If you're thinking about getting Mexican food for Cinco De Mayo, that is your best option!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! my boyfriend and I come here so often. We love that they do carry out, it's always nice to order it and be able to eat at home when aren't feeling like being out. Hands down one of the best Mexican places I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"My family's go-to place for Mexican food. The prices are fair and the portions are huge. You can't leave hungry. The chips and salsa are amazing. My favorites are the carnitas plate and the taco/chile relleno plate. They will give you free fried ice cream on your birthday."}
{"text":"Saw some nice reviews for Mucho Bueno's and decided to give them a try. Went there on a Sunday eve with some friends. Had no problem being seated. My margarita was good, especially considering I paid more for one at another place about a month ago that was about half the size. Chips are served warm. Fantastic! And all five of us enjoyed our meals, the two vegetarians as well as the carnivores. One drawback, however, most of us noticed was the over use of salt, and this was noted by both vegetarians and carnivores. Because of that I'm going to have to give it only 3 1/2 stars instead of 4. But I would be willing to return sometime in the future to see if this was a one-time thing."}
{"text":"Yummy food, clean place, good service"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. The chorizo and eggs was very tasty and the pork in the chili verde burrito was cooked perfect. I'll will definitely come back when I am next in Brunswick."}
{"text":"Based on reviews, we stopped here for dinner on our way to a high school football game and were not disappointed.  Very casual atmosphere, but friendly staff that accommodated our short time frame.  Chips and salsa were tasty and meals were excellent.  My husband had a burrito special and I ordered a la carte, 1 spinach enchilada and 1 chile rellenos...both were great.  If we lived close by, we'd be eat here often!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's close to home and the food tastes incredible."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in the Southwest so I know my Mexican food and finding it in Ohio is HARD. Mucho Buenos is the first place I go to when I am craving good Mexican food. I love that they have plenty of vegetarian options and their salsa is perfect. The staff is always incredibly friendly when I go with my family. I haven't been to too many Mexican restaurants (Chipotle doesn't count) that have meat alternatives (tofu) it would be nice to see possibly in the future!"}
{"text":"Good food and sub-par service earns this restaurant a 3 out of 5.  Was craving guacamole, rice, and beans so I yelped for the nearest Mexican restaurant and was pleased to see such good reviews overall. But the joy I entered the restaurant with was immediately gone when I was asked \"Drink?\" before I could even get my butt in my chair (seriously. Took my jacket off and was already approached by a waiter before I could sit).   Maybe I had a presence about me that said \"I want the fastest, least-personal service today please, with a side of guacamole.\"  Speaking of guac, I ordered my enchiladas and beans and asked for a side of guac. My side of guac never came.  If you're looking for quick Mexican food, this is the place to be. But if you want friendly service, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"No matter where I go, from Texas to Ohio, I'm pretty sure the same guy is the cook in every mexican restaurant. That said, my enchiladas were good, and the serving was enormous. The margarita was strong and pretty much the same as everywhere. Prices were really good, and the place was bright and fun. Salsa was great as well."}
{"text":"I had one of the best Mexican meals in a very long time.  The atmosphere was very nice and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I would recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Mucho Bueno is just slightly better than most other Mexican restaurants, honestly. The service is good. The food is ok.  i do enjoy coming in for lunch if i'm in the area as the Burrito Grande is fairly good.  again, because it's a little better than most others, i'll likely be back when i'm finished with my self-imposed ban on Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"We were passing through town and decided to check them out.  The staff and ambience were very good but the food was the best Mexican food we have ever had.  Fresh, authentic and great taste.  Could not recommend this place high enough.  They had the best salsa I have ever had, made fresh that day"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome and our son loved it. There were other kids there, so we didn't feel too bad taking our family. The staff was nice and fast and the food was really good."}
{"text":"Mucho buenos is pretty good. The service was ok and the same with the food. If you want a fun cheap night with friends or family this is the place."}
{"text":"Such a cute little Mexican restaurant!  They have a huge menu and service is ridiculously fast -- like most other Mexican restaurants.  They're in a great location right off of 303.  I've never had to wait long for a table either.  The place is wildly decorated and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family has been going here since it opened. Kids love it, funky décor, nice ambiance. Food is fantastic and very flavorful with large portions. Their burrito with everything is larger than a Chipotle burrito. Kitchen has always done a good job with speed and our food has never been cold or lukewarm. The owner is usually walking around at dinnertime asking how things are. We got forgotten by our waiter for a short bit and the owner came over, took care of all of our drinks. They really act like they care and appreciate your business! We bring everyone here we can and they walk out with the same feeling. Great pricing, can't say enough. We'll continue to return to this fine, reasonably-priced restaurant! Without alcohol our dinner is always usually around $50 for four people and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Medina Co! Kids LOVE the decor and the salsa is fantastic."}
{"text":"Another really nice restaurant located in Town Center Brunswick between Giant Eagle and Home Depot.   I like the decor.  it has lots of pastels.  Food is excellent and the portions large.  get a platter that has several things.  Serve is prompt and friendly.  Prices are reasonable.  Space is a little limited inside, might not be good for groups."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food I've eaten in the Cleveland area. I think most places have poorly seasoned chicken and beef/steak in their dishes, but not this place. The flavors really set it apart from other Mexican restaurants around here. It's worth the drive from Cleveland. Service was friendly, fast and the decor is fun. I recommend the chimichangas!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food in the heart of Brunswick, OH. We come here a lot and every time I get really excited like a school girl going to cheerleading practice.  My favorite thing to get is the #36 CAZUELADA because it has a little bit of everything. Steak, chicken, Mexican sausage sauteed with poblano pepper, onions, cheese, and served with rice and beans. Can't get much better than that. Service, whether takeout or dine-in, is super quick."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant by far. The staff is great and the food is even better. Also the price is right. Do your self a favor and visit."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican I've ever had.  Blows cozumel and fiesta jalapeno out of the water.  Super clean and awesome staff. Also the best queso I've ever had"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants and we eat here weekly usually. All the lunch specials are good along with the salsa."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place every time we eat there.  Some Mexican restaurants are hit or miss with their food but not this one. They have a great lunch specials and prices."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Everyone in our office loves this place. Give the carnitas a rip! We've been coming here for over 7 years and haven't  had a single bad meal or poor customer service experience. Chile verde and hue is rancheros for lunch do not disappoint. 5 stars, I cannot recommend this place enough!!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican place of all time! Their queso is the best I've ever had. They have good lunch specials, decent prices for all of their food, and many many items to choose from The staff is very nice and friendly too. Love the atmosphere and food at muchos!"}
{"text":"Was super fresh and delicious!! Can really tell it is made to order. Super affordable!! Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"My waitress was awesome  refill on chips and salsa.   She was engaging to my daughter was very nice.  She got real busy while we were here she maintained very well.  The food was good meat slices little to thin small for me but all and all good.  The ambience is nice.   There was no music playing so that was weird."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at one of the other Mexican places in town, that is until my take out orders were awful. I started coming here at the recommendation of a friend. It's SO good. I love the Sangria, though I wish it had actual fruit in it.   The chicken burritos are amazingly cheesy and delicious. The chimichangas, fajita quesadilla, you can't go wrong. The burrito sauce is deliciously garlicky. So good. This is my new favorite Mexican place when I'm home in the 'burbs."}
{"text":"Many tasty options (like most Midwest Mexican places) but Muchos Buenos sets itself apart with fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"The food and margaritas are always good. The fajita quesadilla is great. We seem to always get the same bad waiter. He is ALWAYS there. He doesn't seem to understand the English language enough to take our order accurately. He just nods and brings what he thinks we ordered. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be an issue, but it has happened 100% of the time he's waited on us. We go here once a week and love the food we end up with but it would be nice to end up with what we ordered.  We continue to go here at least once a week! The salsa and chips are always fresh, the fajitas are soooo yummy & you can't go wrong with a Texana margarita! Seriously, we haven't had a bad dish. The service has tremendously improved! We love Mario and Pepe! The owner is always on site ensuring everyone is happy and full! I can't say enough great stuff about Muchos Buenos....way better than Cozumel, down the street. Think we'll head there tonight!!!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable. Good food. Nice and attentive service. Would recommend. Kids enjoyed their food a great deal. Portion sizes were very good. We will be back for certain."}
{"text":"Small place go early or prepare to wait for food  Deal on Margartias $5  Today's menu option was enchiladas rancheros!  Two ground beef and two chickie enchiladas, but they're covered in really awesome mole sauce.  We are talking real, slightly smoky and just a little bite mole sauce.  The beef is actually better than the chickie.  Still everything still has homemade texture and flavors.  You can substitute beans for rice.  On Tuesday, it was a three person staff.  Service was a little slow, but good food makes up for wait."}
{"text":"A small local Mexican Restaurant where you can get a good portion of excellent food for a decent price.  One of my favorite places for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My favorite! BEST Mexican food!! Fresh chips and salsa. Great authentic menu selections. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great food, great service and great prices! This is our go to local restaurant. The staff is awesome as is the food. Always clean and neat!!!"}
{"text":"If you walk in to this place expecting a Michelin star meal for 3 dollars, you're going to have a bad time.   The Enchiladas Mexicanas is 8 dollars... For 6 enchiladas. Tell me you didn't use chips to get every last bit of queso off the plate. That's what I thought.   The chips are warm, the salsa has just the right hint of spice. The enchiladas were masterfully crafted by Mexican wizards hiding somewhere in the back.  In the get absolutely stuffed for 10 bucks and enjoy every minute of it category - This place gets 5 stars.  5/5 would cram more into my maw if I wasn't already going to explode."}
{"text":"This is an establishment where you can get a lot of good authentic Mexican food, while on a budget. The whole staff is very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Don't be dissuaded by the 3-stars. It was good. The thing is, it was just \"good.\" Nothing special. Cleveland could use a \"really good\" Mexican restaurant; unfortunately this isn't it.   Service was friendly, prompt and attentive. Decor was festive. Food was very similar to every other Mexican joint around town. I didn't find anything special.   If you're In the mood for some quick Mexican, this place will do in a pinch. As for me, I'll continue my quest for a \"really good\" Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was EXCELLENT! The lunch menu had many options and was a great deal. The waiter easily accommodated my vegetarian diet."}
{"text":"Really good food. My wife had the fajita quesadilla and I had the #36. Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped in because of the good ratings and it was good!!  I ordered enchiladas supremas- which is 4 different enchiladas. They were all good - I didn't like the chicken one bc it tasted like green peppers but the rest were good   My husband had the quesadilla mucho buenos which was AMAZING. The pieces of \"burnt\" Mexican chorizo were soooo good!!! He also had a yummy peach margarita and the enchiladas mexicanas - he thought they were ok, but nothing to write home about.   The restaurant itself is kinda weird. It looks like a carry out place   All in all we enjoyed the meal and would return"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for Mexican food. The menu has a large variety of different items to order, from meat eaters to vegetarians. Food tastes great. Staff is very friendly and great with kids. They are very welcoming. This place will become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place. The prices are low and the margaritas are cold and always the special!!"}
{"text":"its been a long time since we have ate here.. but I remember it being pretty good.. anyhow, we ordered the  chicken taco salad and the chicken burro.   We found everything to be rather buttery..  almost to sweet to eat.. actually, neither of us finished our dishes. I can't believe I'm saying this but. I think Cozumel is better in Brunswick.. Anyhow, this place gets good reviews,  we won't be back.. but it might just be that some people like this type of food.. Heavy and creamy.. I don't how else to describe the food... .. prices were reasonable and staff freindly..  ps.. we did like the chips and salsa"}
{"text":"I love the steak fajita quesadilla! The queso cheese is terrific and my husband loves the #36"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican dinner style restaurant. My wife and I lived in Yuma, Az for a few years and enjoyed the authentic food close to the border. This place isn't truly authentic with their food, but it is still very good. The salsa and chips are pretty spot on. The atmosphere is that of a traditional small dinner near the border. You won't be satisfied if you are looking for a grand fiesta style large restaurant though.   A great place to grab some tacos and a margarita. Personally we ate the fajitas and had some margaritas, all around very satisfied, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place , plus delicious food and really big plates i recomend this place 100%"}
{"text":"Ok, so....I went here for lunch today and was fully prepared to give this place four stars when the host pulled out my seat for me. You heard me! Pulled out my seat! I was so surprised I almost didn't know what to say. Now I'm not a woman who expects this behavior nor am I one to discourage it. I am indifferent, but the manners of that kid moved me at the moment.   The food is awesome. For years my co-workers and I had been going there every Friday and the waiters always knew what we wanted. This is the best Mexican food I've found around here and it is always hoppin'. Also, best fried ice cream ever...not kidding. The décor is a little off putting when you first walk in but you learn to appreciate it. Lots of bright colors and some very strange art on the walls.   You can't go wrong with the #13. Little known secret, if you ask, they will give it to you with mixed steak and chicken. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"LOVE Mucho Buenos !!!  Normally its our go-to but with how small it is there are times when we end up across town.  The salsa is awesome, they tequila is always available :) - grilled chicken tacos are fantastic and its my wifes favorite Guac in Brunswick.  The environment is kind of sanitized, if you are looking for a better dining environment Cozumel is better, but I feel like the food at Mucho is Mucho better.  Both places are good, but if we have a choice Mucho is primary."}
{"text":"Pretty excellent food. We just recently moved to Brunswick and after a long day of moving, stopped here for some food. The food was excellent and fresh, the waiter was polite and diligent. Despite being relatively busy, I don't think it took any more than 15 minutes to be sat and have food at our table. I'm not big on margaritas, so I did not partake, but they looked fantastic. Great experience overall. Will stop back."}
{"text":"Get the quesadilla with the white cheese on top! It's the best thing ever and tastes even better warmed up the next day! It's gooey and amazing! Their rice is good too! The staff is great. The salsa is good and the fried iced cream rocks!!!!! My fave Mexican place by far."}
{"text":"I headed to this restaurant after an amazing shopping spree. The decor is vibrant and colorful and there is sufficient seating for a good number of people. I'm a fan of fajitas so I ended up ordering shrimp fajitas. Their salsa is nice and perfectly balanced for a wide variety of taste buds.  Their service is super quick and staff is friendly. I'd recommend this place to my friends ..."}
{"text":"My family of 5 went to dinner on a Friday evening around 7:00. There was a short wait, but the food came quickly after ordering. The food was amazing. We love Mexican food so we have been to many different restaurants in the area. The food at MB was the best around. The beef and chicken were fresh and had great flavor. The salsa was amazing. The food is 5+ stars.   Sadly our waiter was horrible. He was rude and would walk away mid sentence when we were trying to talk to him. We asked another waiter for more chips and salsas and he told our waiter who looked at us and never got us any. He never came to check on us. I stopped the owner who was walking by to ask for refills, more chips and salsa and an extra plate. Then the owner could tell we were done eating and came over to ask if we needed boxes. When the waiter finally came over after all that and asked how everything was, I didn't bother going into a long dissertation of how lousy his service was. They were busy so I'll give him a bye.   We will definitely be back. Prices were amazing for the amount of food you get. Everyone has an off day. We will give them another chance."}
{"text":"Very good food, fast service and good prices. The dinning area is a bit small and you sometimes feel like you are having dinner with the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Good mexican food! Got the carnitas which were very tasty and the portion was large. Better than the average mexican restaurants. Service was good."}
{"text":"This place is absolute FIRE!! Probably the BEST Mexican I've had, and I travel a lot! Even beats out a lot of SoCal spots I've tried. The Queso Fundito is a must here, SOOOO TASTY!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here! This place is Great! The atmosphere is clean, fun, and upbeat. Our waiter Mario, was attentive and courteous. Our salsa and chips never nan empty! The food is excellent! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The standouts for me from Mucho Buenos were the kick-ass margaritas and the exceptional service, two things that are not always the easiest to find in Mexican restaurants. Decided to pre-game family holiday dinner (y'all know what I'm talking about!) and stopped in here to find a quick meal and a decent margarita. The inside is quite kitschy, in a warm and inviting way. As I said, the service really stood out to me. We were greeted immediately, and our server was super helpful in describing the margaritas to us. He recommended the Texana as he said something about the orange citrus undertone mellows out the sourness. We weren't disappointed. We got the half pitcher and could barely finish it between the two of us... they definitely pack a punch, and the taste was a perfect balance of tangy and citrusy. As for the food, it was pretty average as far as Americanized Mexican food goes, but the menu is huge so you could probably find any Mexican dish you're craving right here. I would definitely come back here as my go-to Mexican restaurant, and I can't wait to get more of those tasty margaritas."}
