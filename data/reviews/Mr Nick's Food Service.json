{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch and the food and service is always excellent. I only order the chicken or pork souvlaki everytime I go here so I don't know how the other items taste. My friend had the 8oz steak cooked medium rare and she said it was really good."}
{"text":"Hellas!   I am so honored to be the first to bring this little place to all of your attentions. This is truly one of the hidden gems in Thornhill. I found out about it through close friends working in the construction industry and I was sworn to secrecy about it as they didn't want their special place do get any busier.  Sorry fellas - I can't keep this one to myself anymore the GTA world needs to know all about Mr. Nicks. Also, I will be updating this review with photos in the coming days.  Walking in for the first time you should be warned that this is not your typical Greek restaurant. The fixtures are slightly outdated and many of the pictures are faded with age. In fact, other than the name on the door and menu we will just call this place a \"family style\" restaurant (and sports bar apparently).  Each visit I am consistently blow away by the staff - smiling, friendly and attentive (despite being slammed every day at lunch). N.B: If you are going for lunch arrive early because once the local business guys and gals arrive you'll be hard pressed to find a seat.  The menu is certainly the biggest thing that keeps me coming back for more. Everything on Mr. Nicks menu is HOMEMADE. The burgers are huge and homemade, the soups are filling on their own and home made. Souvlaki, homemade. Dessert, store bought....ahhhhhh just kidding silly they're EXTRA HOMEMADE!!! YUMM-O!  Portion sizes here are huge across the board, my go to meal is the Chicken Souvlaki salad when I'm feeling healthy ($11.99) - comes with fresh tzatziki and pita bread. But if I have nothing better to do with my afternoon but slip silently into a Titan-like slumber I will go for the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner. This dish comes armed with more carbs than Greece has islands - fresh tzatziki, pita bread, salad, potatoes, and rice. All for only $1 more than the salad ($12.99) OPA!  While there aren't any plates smashing, belly dancers or flaming cheeses, Mr. Nicks, focus is on good quality, family friendly, Homemade food - and they do it great!  Good enough for me, I'll be back many times - Hungry"}
{"text":"Located close to the office and we order at least once a month.    Seriously, this place has massive portions beyond belief and that's no complaint!  I usually order a traditional Poutine with a side of ceaser salad.. which allows for some left over Poutine to save for later.    For what it is you can dine in but it seems a little dimly lit.  Maybe mostly caters to some truck drivers passing by in the area since it's facing off Langstaff.     Takeout is done anyway and the staff are extremely friendly and willing to help take out large orders to your car.  I appreciate that customer service next to none.  Common sense thanks you!   Food is simple and yummy and unique little places like these are something that every area needs one."}
{"text":"The beef pouting is good. And huge portion but I bit salty.    However. They don't use beef strips. Just those thin sliced beef.   Will try other stuff if possible."}
{"text":"Not worth 40$  Mashed potatoes were dry  The prime rib sandwich had nothing on it just meat and 2 slices of bread   The salad was soggy  Gravy was salty  Good note added mayo and hot sauce at home and was way better"}
{"text":"Mr. Nicks is a busy lunch time place. Staff are always pleasant. I usually order the chicken souvlaki salad but today I had the Caesar salad with albacore tuna and shrimp. I ve had it before and usually good but this time I have to say it was not the same. One draw back don't be  in a hurray as it usually takes a half hour to get your food. I will go back as everyone has an off day and I know there food is good."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times with coworkers and to be quite honest, everything tastes the same.  I have had the souvlaki, burgers, and the breakfasts."}
