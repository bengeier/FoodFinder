{"text":"I'm surprised this place has so few reviews.
Belly Busters has been around for as long as I can remember, but I only discovered it this summer.  Since then, I'm at the shop at least once a week.

These guys churn out a real nice sub.  It's honest to goodness, simple subs.  Nothing fancy, nothing unnecessary.  Just great tasting, very fresh subs.  You want a healthy but filling meal for under 10 dollars (with drink)?  Look no further, this is the place to be.

It's great food that while on the surface, may not seem so fantastic.  It's proof that the food is much more than the individual ingredients.  It's the combination of everything that makes it wonderful.  These days when everyone is wild about gourmet, it's refreshing to go back to basics and have good wholesome sandwiches.  These guys deliver!

The boys there are always friendly, ultra efficient and have got this down to a science.  You won't be disappointed with belly busters."}
{"text":"Smells so weird in there. So weird.

The staff was unenthused and the tables are wobbly and dirty. The sub tasted OK, but the guy used his bare hands to make it, so it kind of put a defined max on how much I could really enjoy it... 

I probably won't be back; something's fishy here that doesn't blend with my tastes..."}
{"text":"A Hog's Hollow classic.  This place has been around forever and will be for many more years.  Open late, it's often a destination after the bars and before heading home.  The subs are very simple, but somehow it just works.  The turkey bacon is legendary.  In high school I was allowed to be late after lunch if I brought my teacher some bellies.  Thats how good it is."}
{"text":"Probably the best submarine place to go to in Toronto! 
As a loyal customer for a year, i can say that Belly Buster's offers fresh, well prepared, and jam packed submarines, that really hits the spot when your extremly hungry. The regular submarines are foot longs, and are always packed with meat and your choice of toppings. They certainly are not stingy when it comes to packing in a great submarine! The most popular submarines being Turkey Bacon, Bacon Combo and The Bellybuster, which all range around $7-9 dollars. Not a bad price considering your getting a foot long submarine that is jam packed with your desired toppings, and you pay the same for your typical Quiznos regular sub which has hardly any meat in it compared to Bellys. There long history of establishment just goes to show the commitment and great submarines they have been serving Toronto for many years. I have never had issues with the quality of submarines served. They are always consistent and serve the same great tasting sub each time you come back! So give it a try, and consider it one of your late night eats as well as they are open very late during the summers!"}
{"text":"They wash the counter, touch money then they make your sub. Guys hands are greasy and dirty. Absolutely filthy place. Subs are terrible and stale."}
{"text":"This place has been my late night bite for many years. The best sandwich is the bacon combo. Very friendly staff. They are open pretty late on Fridays and Saturdays. Just keep in mind thaf It is cash only. 

We also trued the new location on King West. Unfortunately the experience was awful. We got the same club we always get from the Yonge branch but the taste was not even close. We did call the original branch and complained. I really hope they'll fix it."}
{"text":"Asked for the roast beef and mushroom sub, only received roast beef. Mediocre sub, nothing too good, not terrible. Had a vanilla milkshake that I couldn't drink, had a funny taste. Overall I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow -- I can't believe no one has reviewed this place before. Simply put, Belly's is one of the best sandwich shops in the city.  

Points for: 
- Being an independent sub shop (so rare these days).
-  Friendly staff.
- Slicing the bread completely in half (unlike the Subway cut, which looks like a gutted muskrat).
- Real Hellman's mayo -- delicious.
- Loading up your sandwich with meat -- you think they'll never stop.
- The bacon. Wow. It's cooked in the microwave (which may sound weird) but it's on this amazing tray that makes it so crispy and delicious -- plus they give you a ton of it. 
- Vintage video games (Bust-a-Move) in the corner.
- Late hours.

Points off (well, I'm not actually taking points off, but downsides):
- Limited seating
- Sometimes the wait can be a bit long.
- Closed Sundays

So, seriously, if you haven't been to Belly's, go. It's a neighborhood hangout that's just hits the spot perfectly when you want an awesome sub."}
{"text":"I went in today it smelled do revolting like old stale burnt bacon.  I feel like vomiting just thinking about the smell.   Two hours later I can still imagine the horrendous stench."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Belly Busters! Not only is the food great but the staff are super friendly! 

They've added some great new toppings for the submarines and also recently added salads to the menu. Fresh to order! (The Caesar is super delicious I can't wait to try them all!)

Wasn't too sure about them when they first opened but they've really managed to turn things around. So far I like all of the changes and I'm glad I'll be sticking around as a loyal customer! So much better than the competition!

My absolute favorite sub is the Turkey with Bacon! If you're trying Belly Busters for the first time, the Turkey Bacon is a great first step in to the world of Belly Busters!"}
{"text":"Belly's is one of the best sub places in the city. Although it looks like a dive inside, it's a great spot for all hour eats (open late). 

I get either a turkey, turkey and salami, or corn beef and they're all great. The lettuce is shredded, bread is soft and fresh, and condiments are terrific. 

Food - 5/5
Service - take out but 5/5
Ambiance - 2/5
Price to value ratio: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Oh Belly's. I grew up explaining where I lived to every person I met by relating my distance from you. I have eaten so many of your turkey bacon subs over the years. 

Literally just up the hill from the house I grew up in, delicious amazing subs. I don't know what happens to make everything so good, but Michael S is right -there's something about hot bacon and mayo."}
{"text":"Belly busters is sort of like a \"high end\" subway.

There bread is store bought, they reheat there meat in a microwave, there meat tastes bland and plasticy. Service is bored looking. 

Its a subway with better sauce. 

Not worth the drive from anywhere...."}
{"text":"Just had the amazing turkey bacon sub.  WOW, it was sooo good. The bun was so fresh and the bacon was incredible.  This was my firs time eating at Belly Busters. definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"if you live or work in the neighbourhood, it's a nice option and the small subs are filling. I had the turkey bacon and it was good. However, I would not go out of my way to go there. While the staff is friendly and the ingredients fresh, it's nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot when fresh is the operative word. Open late every night but closed on Sunday's. 100x better than Subway and their steak and chees is the bomb!  This place usually has the Jays or Raptor's game on the TV as you wait to have your sub built. The nostalgic feel to this place like you are in 1985 is actually very cool! 

Would have been 5/5 accept for the fact that communication is not their strongest attribute. For example staff need to announce or post signage indicating that they now accept \"debit\" as a MOP. Also they should be asking their customers if they want to join their loyalty program or else have it all!"}
{"text":"These guys make subs the way they should be. Real thick turkey and not paper thin like subway or Quiznos, you can actually taste the meat. 
If you want a sub that doesn't taste like a salad sandwich this is the place."}
{"text":"Still Great!
Especially the BLT, Turkey-Bacon and Bacon Combo subs.
The old school shredded lettuce, and curt but efficient Hellenic service all adds to the charm of this 1970s style Submarine shop that truly makes the best bacon included Subs anywhere!
Once a classic always a classic and open until the wee hours of the morning for your post partying enjoyment!
Many a hangover has been avoided thanks to a late night belly Buster BLT or bacon combo sub. Just go you thank me later!"}
{"text":"Bacon combo.  12 inches.  Whole wheat.  The works - put it all on! Lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cheese, hot peppers, pickles, mustard, mayo, salt, pepper, sub sauce, just put it all on there.  Let me listen to that microwaved bacon crackle.  Let's throw a peach Snapple into the mix.  Did that just cost me less than $10?  Am I going to be full for another half week?  Legendary spot.  Lots of history.  There should be a Belly's on every street corner."}
{"text":"Yes. You end up just getting so use to Subway that you forget what a real submarine sandwich should taste like. The bread is soft and light. The toppings are fresh. The lettuce. Perfection. Bacon? Yes, please. The service is always wonderful and the prices are more than fair. It really is a great sub and they're open late on Fridays and Saturdays. Bacon."}
{"text":"soft bread, crispy bacons, shredded crispy lettuce, huge size..

very good price, for such a nice sandwich, 
turkey bacon is my favorite, 
it going to be a regular lunch place for me for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there today, for the first time. I went with the 12\" Bacon Combo - I added mayo and asked for gravy, as per the suggestion of many Yelp reviewers.

I was quite impressed overall! Here are some key points:

- The bread was soft, tasted fresh, nothing crazy which is perfectly fine
- The ham and turkey were both great, but not as good as the...
- Bacon! They put a ton of it, and it's not like other sub places where it's already cooked... here, they take uncooked bacon and microwave it right before they put it on your sub, and it's great stuff.
- The mayo was very tasty (probably quite rich) and the gravy paired well with it
- I like their lettuce. It's shredded VERY thin and therefore stays clumped together quite well, like a slaw.
- I was very pleased with how clean it all was -- there was literally no mess, no sauce leaked out anywhere... contrast that to some subs from Quiznos, which while good, have been known to fall apart completely (pieces of chicken or various veggies falling out -- it has happened to me countless times)

(We knew it was CASH ONLY, but I'm gonna add that here again just for others to note)

As a side note, the prices quoted on their website aren't the same as in stores -- in fact, the in-store prices at this location were LOWER than the website's PDF, across the board! I guess the site's pricing is only for the downtown King Street location, but the Yonge location? Cheaper!! $7.05 for a 12\" bacon combo, and my friend got the 12\" gyro sub for only $5.95.

- They put a ton of meat on his gyro sub -- he found it all delicious
- He asked for mayo too, but the guy wisely told him to stick with just the tzatziki sauce that comes on that sub... my friend took that advice and didn't regret it!

Friendly, quick, accurate, and with lots of choices -- and $13 for two very good and well assembled footlong subs? I'm fine with all that.

We'll be going back. You can be sure of that. YUM!

Edit: I went back and tried the gyro sub. I prefer the Bacon Combo, but it was still VERY good! No sub sauce, no mayo... just the tzatziki sauce. It paired well with it. I also love how late they're open. I was hungry at 11pm and boom, Belly Busters is there for me :)"}
{"text":"Great late night drunk in destination. Excellent subs and open late most nights. Crawling distance from my house. A+++"}
{"text":"Ok its not even close, best sub ANYWHERE. You're trashed and need something to eat you have only two options, chinese food an New Ho King or Belly Busters. Get the Turkey Bacon Sub, Its turkey with strips of bacon. Get extra bacon and make sure it is extra kosher and extra crispy. And yes, that mayo they use IS real Hellmans. Down it with chocolate milk yum"}
{"text":"Best subs in the city by FAR! I usually get the cheese sub but I have gotten a bacon sub in the past and they're really just so tasty!!! 

The only bad thing about it is that it's closed on sunday!! noooooo. I want Bellys right now."}
{"text":"This is the best, most authentic sub joint that T.O. has.  I love that nothing changes and that i can still get my fix once or twice a year - reminds me of high school and I can still find the pictures on the wall."}
{"text":"Memories! 

back in high school my friends and i used to driver over here to grab lunch, the place hasn't changed one bit : )

i always order the Bacon Combo but make sure you ask for GRAVY! that's a secret tip.

what makes this sub so good? everything! all the small details they add.  the bread is nice and soft, lettuce shredded, bacon super crispy, and the friendly service you get everytime.  they always make you laugh or smile.  Also what is so great are the toppings.  Just ask for whatever you want because some toppings are hidden due to space, so don't be shy.

can you tell i love this place? lol"}
{"text":"Open late so if you're drunk and want some munchies and are in the area, this isn't a bad place to hit up. There is not a lot of seating room and it's pretty crowded late night with drunk people. I can say that this place does not serves the best subs but they are still pretty good. I would probably have given Belly Busters 4 stars but one time, I got an italian sausage and they microwaved my sausage. Except that when they served it to me, the sausage was still raw on the inside which is nasty. I ended up tossing the sub and walking out hungry."}
{"text":"Love their subs.  An original oldie but goodie.  Fresh bread.  AMAZING bacon.  Probably the best bacon sub you will ever get.   I love putting their 12 incher in my mouth.
Now on to the real reason why this is the best.  Their lettuce.  Yeah maybe you think i'm crazy.  Their finely shredded lettuce is the best.  So old school and so good.  NO ONE does lettuce like that anymore.    
This place has stood the test of time and they have not changed a thing.  Good job!  Open more locations you will do fine.  Just not stupid locations like on Hwy 7 and Centre St.  That was really stupid."}
{"text":"Bellys is an institution in the York Mills/North Toronto neighbourhood. Best submarine sandwiches out there. Bacon is superb, although it's the shredded lettuce that sets Belly's apart from the sub-shop crowd. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Belly Busters - serving great subs to the \"North-Yonge Village\" crowd since I was a kid. I even remember when they had Space Invaders! They replaced it with Defender, followed by Stargate, then Joust. I don't know which one is in there now. 
Pile 'em high sandwhiches made to order.
Support your local independent business man - have a Belly Buster today!"}
{"text":"I've got three basic rules that have made me the singular successful guy I am and have kept me in the running to be a Darwinian success.

1) If someone comes at you with a knife or hard object in hand and shouts \"we don't like your kind around here\", you should run away.

2) Never argue with a woman who has a visible tattoo. 

3) If someone asks \"do you want gravy on that?\" always, always answer in the affirmative.

I was pleasantly surprised when the guy behind the counter fixing up my Belly Buster sub asked \"do you want gravy on that?\". Yes. Yes, I do.

Gravy on a sub? What a fantastic idea. Now don't get me wrong. I like the $5 foot long at Subway, an innovation I feel rivals Ford's introduction of the production line to American car manufacturing. A foot of carbs, meat and cheese, for about 1/3 of what a movie ticket will run you these days is incredible.

But it's nice to mix up your sub experience some time with something different and I'm not talking that Mr. Sub crap. No. Belly Buster sub gives you a nicely meat stacked foot long on a really, really creamy fresh bread. The gravy is just the gravy on top. 

Another trick, if there's an eponymous menu item, order that. Hence, if the place is called Belly Buster Sub, order the Belly Buster sub, not the fish 'n' chips.

Belly Busters seems like it's been around for a while, given their well populated wall of fame. They even have a photo of a Maple Leaf. I'm not sure who that is as I haven't paid attention to hockey since the days when Ken Dryden was an expert on goal tending, not education.

Clearly this place has its regs and does a brisk Friday take out. An interesting mix of house rich suited yuppies and people who look like they live on subway sandwiches and live in the subway. 

You will pay a couple bucks more for one of these subs, over a $5 foot long, but the extra $2 sure worth it.

The opening hours seem at first like a misprint. They seem to be open to 3 am on the weekends and 2 am on week days."}
{"text":"I always go here after I have a meeting at my union office. The bread, turkey, bacon lettuce, tomatoes, onions, sub sauce and mayonnaise go well together. Sometimes I get 2 just so I could have one for later. I've never been there when it's too busy but I would imagine It would get so especially late at night or for lunch."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me back in 2006. I've been going since. First off, this establishment has been here forever. You can tell because of the wall where the owners have placed photos of past dedicated patrons dating back to maybe the late 60's. This place has been through the times, and when you look at the photos, the hairstyles and fashion statements will tell you how popular this place has been throughout the decades.

The establishment has seating arrangements, enough for a group of friends, but can easily be packed depending on the time you decide to chow down. Don't expect to see napkins and cutlery, it's just one of those historic places where that stuff shouldn't matter -- it's a sandwich spot. 

Now the food. All sandwiches. They have a couple of other options but the sandwiches are boss. I ordered the turkey bacon with extra bacon. The bun options are white or wheat, but I went for the white. You don't go to a place like this and expect to be health cautious. Go all out or go home. The toppings are typical toppings that you wouldn't see at a Subway or Mr.Sub, however, their food still has a homemade feel and doesn't taste \"commercial\". I've never had a \"bad\" sandwich here. The Belly Buster is the signature, but I still tend to go with the turkey bacon or sausage. 

This place is open late for the club goers and drunks who have late night munchies. Go here past midnight and the place can be packed with all people from all age groups. Staff here are OG. Good guys who love to talk sports and current events. The one tv they have is usually playing sports highlights and I have no complaints with that. 

Great spot. Great food. Parking is a bitch. Great place for hunger cravings. Still waiting to try the King W location."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a decade. Bacon combo is what I love. As others have said, the bacon subs are the ones to order. Simple subs, no over the top toppings, but a great, simple home style taste that can't be replicated by the chains."}
{"text":"i'm not sure exactly what it is about this place that's kept me coming back.  i think it's probably the...ridiculously amazing subs they make!  i've been coming here for about 10 years now, and i think it's possible that the submarines have gotten better since.

seating is a bit limited, but as long as you don't go during the rush hours, you should be fine.  be prepared to wait 10 mins if it's after last call and you've got a craving.

their bacon is just the right crispiness, their meats are fresh, fleshly diced lettuce, freshly sliced tomatoes and onions, homemade sub sauce, soft bread. mmmmmm

i love that the walls are decorated with photos of loyal customers, some dating back to times when fashion meant a mullet :S  they even have a pic with the stanley cup!

this local spot has a following for a reason.  if you love submarine sandwiches, you have to try one at belly busters.

must gets are: anything with bacon

\"lettuce, tomatoes, onions guys?\""}
{"text":"Everytime I am north of Bloor I crave one of Belly Buster's subs. Possibly because I grew up eating them after a night on the town but the flavour is what keeps me coming back.

I always order the Turkey Bacon or Bacon Combo sub. There is something about their microwaved bacon that makes it incredible!

If you want barbecue sauce or green peppers they keep these hidden in the fridge so just ask.

Don't expect any service, though the owner who is usually behind the counter is always friendly, but expect a simple well made submarine sandwich. There are some places to eat but again it is very basic interior.

What more can I say, try this place for yourself and don't let the name scare you away!"}
{"text":"The other two reviews have done Belly Buster's justice - the place is awesome. 

You must get a Turkey Bacon sub while here there is something in the combo of delicious mayo and hot bacon that makes Belly's a serious treat. 

I'll quote another review as it said it best...\"So, seriously, if you haven't been to Belly's, go. It's a neighborhood hangout that's just hits the spot perfectly when you want an awesome sub.\""}
{"text":"Turkey bacon with extra bacon....nuff said.:) Much better option than Mr. Sub and Subway.  Only complaint is that they don't accept credit or debit.  They do have a bank machine with an annoying service charge for using it."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here before so thought I'd give it a shot. It has a good rating on here, but this is lost on me. Maybe it's my fault for not reading all the reviews and seeing what one sub they make well. Anywho, I got the pizza sub, which was warmed up in the microwave and featured old veggies and low quality cheese. I ended up throwing most of it out."}
{"text":"Neighborhood staple, great late night spot on a friday or saturday. Only kncok is its usually closed Sundays. Would stick to the bacon subs, the real bacon they use is refreshing to the instant bacon at places like Subway and Mr. Sub. Truly a legendary local spot, I've even seen it listed as David Lee (Nota Bene, formally of Splendido and Centro) list it as his favorite late night spot along with The Burger Shack."}
{"text":"Old school subs, the way Mr. Sub used to be, but since Subway and Quiznos hit the scene, Mr. Sub changed too much and not for the better IMHO.

At Belly Buster's the buns are soft, white or whole wheat, and the toppings are simple - except for the famous \"Belly Buster\" which has gravy. Gravy!

It is crazy how good the bacon is considering they cook in the microwave... but the have several to keep up with the demand... that is how popular bacon is there.

The best part - they are open late every night, but be warned on weekends after the bars close, the place is swamped with local teens with the munchies!

Cash only."}
{"text":"Oh my. 

Forget about all the other sub chains in Toronto. This place is part of the city. It's classic. It's ohhh so delicious. 

This review will be short and sweet. 

Get the turkey bacon sub. The shredded lettuce is nice and fresh. The bacon is microwaved and yummy. The bread is always fresh. Mayo is spread on with a nice. It's homemade but special. 

They don't take credit cards unfortunately but they still deserve the 5 star rating  

What are you waiting for??!!

Wish they still had the location up north but I never got around to trying it. 

Hope this stays open for years to come. Toronto wouldn't be the same without it.

Oh and the decor. It's so old and outdated. It's perfect! Old school seats. Nasty colours everywhere. Please don't change belly busters. Keep being you."}
{"text":"My friend summed it up best when he took me there. He said \"Belly Busters: it's not fancy... there's nothing to it really. I don't know why they're so good\". They just are. Turkey Bacon sub is awesome."}
{"text":"Bellllllies!

One word. Bacon."}
{"text":"Turkey bacon is what you should have. Real simple. I can't help but draw comparisons to Mr. Sub especially the bread and topping combinations. The bacon portion is higher than what you would get at the chain sub shops."}
{"text":"I've long wondered just how the hell this place has stayed open in Yonge and Lawrence. I swear this neighbourhood is a death trap for restos. And it's a chi-chi hood at that, for a place threatening to bust one's belly. This is a yoga mommy, organic green juice, kids-with-15-hobbies kind of area. We finally went together, my husband convincing me after having eaten there several times throughout the past couple of decades. 

And you know, it was pretty good. Not miles better than Subway or anything, but they make a good milkshake and the sandwiches are alright. Not sure that the hygiene standards are 100% up to par, with the cash handling and everything, but hey, we gotta live on the edge sometimes, right? Meatball sub was good, the Belly Buster classic with gravy was kind of mediocre. Our car REALLY smelled like Belly Buster sandwiches for about a week, which you may find enticing or off-putting."}
{"text":"Best sub shop on earth. Bacon Combo is the way to go. Always friendly. First stop when I get into town. Last stop before I leave town."}
{"text":"This is no more than a solid 3.  Definitely better than Subway, but that's not exactly high praise.  At least they understand, unlike Subway, that I don't need a loaf of bread in my sandwich.  Got the Turkey Bacon ($7.50 tax in), there is a decent amount of bacon, and it tastes good.  I don't really have much to say other than I feel a bit let down after the other reviews built up my expectations."}
{"text":"I used to come here as a teenager, back in the days when Mario said \"what a way to go\" to almost anything.

The other night I found myself in need of a late night dinner and stopped in for the first time in over 20 years. Usually when I do that I am disappointed - the current version never lives up to the memory.

Belly Buster is the exception. It is still as amazing as I remember it. The service was great, the food tasted just as it should and I remembered why I was so addicted to these sandwiches when I was young(er)."}
{"text":"Belly Buster had a prominent role in my last year of high school: I'd have a spare before lunch, pile into a car with a bunch of friends, and trek north to Belly's.  We'd pass other lunch options, sure, but none could touch the following equation:

Turkey, bacon, extra mayo.  

RECIPE FOR MAGIC.

The place feels nostalgic for me, so I'll always be drawn back in for a sub when the craving hits.  But for the uninitiated: it's worth a try.  Shredded lettuce, soft bread, a slew of toppings, and a loyal following of Belly devotees.  Belly Buster Submarines is in the business of: deliciousness.

Yelp note: the M-F lunch/after-school rush can get hectic"}
{"text":"My friends have been raving about bellybusters for years. I always thought \"Subway\" was good for subs... Until I ate here. The bread is amazing, the lettuce is better, the meat is way better, they put like 10ibs of bacon on the turkey bacon, and it's GOOD bacon... Not like the McDonald's bacon. The whole thing comes together to be the best sub I've ever had. It's the quality of the ingredients that makes it so good. Also, at subway you can't even see the ingredients in the sandwich.. It's all bread. At bellybusters that is not the case!

The only thing that would make this a 5 star would be if they got more interesting toppings. Even jalapeño would make me happy :)"}
