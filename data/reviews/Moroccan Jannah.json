{"text":"love this family owned moroccan  Restaurant, the food is always superb and the place is very warm and inviting. It has become a tradition for our family to dine there every week and enjoy a moroccan feast, the tajines are very tender and falvourful and their bbq chicken and kafta are just mouth watering. Everything is made fresh and you always get the taste of a home made fresh food.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Although severely understaffed the service was great! The family that runs the place definitely want the experience to be great - but you can tell they are just getting started. A little music and some summer lights would help the atmosphere. The prices are great and you get good value in a meal."}
{"text":"Our family went to this restaurant because we had an online coupon for a discount.  We typically love Moroccan food, so we were pretty excited to go.  The outside looks like a normal stripmall-style foreign food restaurant, complete with sign and curtains obscuring the windows.  When you walk in, we were the only patrons there.  It felt like a cafeteria with bland brown tables and a counter at the back, almost as though they just took a 1970s deli and put up a new sign outside.  There was occasional, sporadic Moroccan-style music playing overhead, punctuated by complete silence.  The waiter/host appeared to be the only person working there.  He was dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, but was extremely friendly and nice (in fact, his kindness was the only reason I didn't give this place one star).  We both ordered the Tanjine dishes, which were not cheap, in the range of $15-$19 each.  Our meals took about 20 minutes to prepare.  When they came out, we were surprised how small the portions were.  The vegetarian Tanjine was essentially just a potato and pea stew... for $15.  Total serving size was about 1.5 cups.  It came with a piece of bread.  Mine was the lamb Tanjine, which had some good chunks of meat in it as well as dried prunes and apricots, for $19.  When I started eating, several of the chunks of meat were very well cooked, but the majority of the chunks was bone, so there really wasn't a lot of meat in the dish.  We ate it quickly with me stopping frequently to spit out small chunks of bone.  In the end, we wouldn't go back.  It was far too expensive for what you get, and the atmosphere is more like a deli or a cafeteria than a restaurant that warrants charging nearly $20 per dish.  The staff is incredibly friendly, but the food and atmosphere was so disappointing."}
