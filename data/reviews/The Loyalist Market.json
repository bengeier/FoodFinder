{"text":"Great concept in Matthews that just opened!  Very nice selection of quality meats and cheeses, nice selection of beer and wine to  go with the sandwiches on great artisan bread.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Really enjoyed the Americano and I'm planning to pick some of their Gouda on the way out.  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"New establishment in Matthews. Excellent selection of domestic cheeses. Haven't had s chance to check out the charcuterie yet. They also prepare trays and sandwiches, etc for eating in or take away. Will definitely be heading back with holidays coming up."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks, food and service. Glad it's finally open and in Matthews! It's like dean and deluca. Has great variety."}
{"text":"Brand new and spotless. A limited but yummy menu (try that grilled cheese!) heavy on fresh sandwiches. Watch them do it all from your barstool. 
The only drawback was the lack of any diet soda. The fridge had some nifty niche drinks but nothing without sugar. It was tap water or dry mouth.
Charcuterie board was exceptional."}
{"text":"I am not sure that I have words to categorize a place like The Loyalist Market. It's a warm, friendly, soothing environment that is inviting and welcomes you with open arms. 

The menu is very simple yet the foods are complex and wonderful. I will most certainly be back the muffuletta was amazing!

The staff and owner are extremely friendly!  This place is a winner for Matthews and should be enjoyed by all!"}
{"text":"What a gem!!!!  Lovely - and delicious - charcuterie board. Excellent wine and our server, Hailey, was outstanding!!!  Our new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"this cheese bar = the best!!!  location = perfect!  \"loyalist\" = brilliant!  locally sourcing = tops!  i can't say enough...just go!"}
{"text":"The food, the wine and the service are absolutely fantastic! We  loved everything we tried!"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for National Grilled Cheese Day! Had a great glass of Riesling and the husband had two beers. Beers were much cheaper than expected, around $3.50 or so. I had the special of the day grilled cheese and he had the Americano. Both were delicious and fresh. Definitely looking forward to going back for a charcuterie board!"}
{"text":"We find quaint little spots when we are out of town and say why don't we have anything like this close to home. Now we do! Chris was wonderful to chat with. He chatted with us on some of the products they bring in. We ordered the Muffuletta and the Ruben. Both were so very good. My husband said that the cheese in the sandwich stood out. The meats in both sandwiches were some of the best we have had. The bread on the Ruben was very flavorful. The Ciabatta could have been a little less chewy, but had good flavor.  We chose the greens as our side, the dressing was amazing! We are already planning on what to order our next trip. If you need stocking stuffers for your foodie, go here for sure! I like that they have family style setting and local artist work. Thank for choosing Mathews to open shop!"}
{"text":"An odd blend of upper crust, casual, and no ambiance.  The upper crust was the cost and the knowledge of the cheese/meat, the casual was that jeans and T-shirt is fine, and the no ambiance... well, it's just sterile.  The waitress kept telling us to invite our friends and spread the word and that they need more customers -- uncomfortable.  

It would be a great place if they tried to make it more comfortable (music, lighting, couches, something) and lowered the prices."}
{"text":"Great, calming atmosphere.  Food was great- I had the grilled cheese, and my wife has the Americano.  Both were fantastic.  What sets this place apart is the attention to detail.  From the absolutely fantastic service, to the antique water glasses- this place does it right.  You can tell that the owner takes extreme pride in his business, and his staff was very attentive.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable staff.  Local foods along with artisinal cheeses and charcuterie.  They have cool and fun events regularly.  Can't wait until the weather warms up so we can enjoy their patio."}
{"text":"Wow.  Totally blown away by this place.  I was on yelp to see something else and when I spotted a Hot New CHEESE SHOP in Matthews we were in the car ten minutes later and on our way over.  The shop itself is super cute, the people there are fabulous and friendly... and omg the food.  We had the cheese and charcuterie plate and to be honest, this was outside my comfort zone - cheese, meat, bread - all good.. but fruits, honey, nuts, jams and olives??  Not for me.. until today that is... that was the most unbelievable assortment of amazing food that never in a million years did I want to try and I would happily have it as my second choice for every meal for the rest of my life.

Second choice?  Doesn't sound like that high of praise but the ONLY reason it'd be my second choice is because I also shared THE most amazing grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  Gouda, cheddar (lots!) all beautifully melty on this fabulous sourdough bread with pepper berry bacon jam?  YES PLEASE.

Cannot express just how good the food was and how it made just a regular old lunch feel like we'd celebrated a special occasion of some sort, but it was THAT good.  

I hate to even tell anyone because full disclosure, I'm not wanting to fight for seating in my new house of worship and I know once this place catches on it'll become crazy busy, but if I keep it entirely to myself their business won't take off and I can NOT let them not make it because well, they're great people (and oh... the food... did I say?)

Wow.  Run, don't walk.  And trust me on the grilled cheese... (I cannot WAIT to go back and try the dinner menu!)."}
{"text":"Best charcuterie in Charlotte! Love this place, and their sandwiches are delicious. Love their staff, too - super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful food with fresh ingredients!! We have been there for lunch and dinner. I had the BEST Rueben sandwich there that I ever had! Also great coffee. I'm so glad this place has come to Matthews!"}
{"text":"This place is miraculous. The owner really knows & loves charcuterie & you can tell by the carefully selected items stocked in this precious meat & cheese shop. Charlotte foodies at long last have one place where they can find great imported & local cheese, cured meats, pickles, sauces, salts, chocolates, oils, crackers, beer & sodas... They serve salads & sandwiches made with great care. This place just ramped up this towns foodie factor by an entire letter grade."}
{"text":"Great shop with friendly staff. Stopped in for a quick Sunday lunch. Roast beef sandwich was very good. Certainly a good spot for a light lunch and a beer."}
{"text":"Cool spot.  Lots of meats and cheeses, great for lunch or to get stocked up before your dinner party."}
{"text":"This place is the best I've found in the Charlotte area if you want a cheese and charcuterie plate. The owner took time to explain the differences in each of the products, and let us sample things before we committed to our purchase. I won't go anywhere else when I am considering a cheese plate for a special occasion. Would be a great place to take a date as well."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a coworker and decided to swing by for lunch. I ordered the charcuterie and cheese board , knowing very well I may have to take some home. Everything was delicious but my absolute favorite was the truffle tremor goat cheese paired with a side of honey to  drizzle over it. It was wonderful, my tastebuds cried, happy tears. 

I think the owner was there, he was very gracious and welcoming. He explained all the items on my board. I really got the sense he had a passion for what he does. 

I plan on going back after work one day soon, so I can enjoy a glass of wine with my board."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place in Matthews! We were waiting for a place like this to open up for a while. The food and charcuterie board was so good and the wait staff and owner were so wonderful! They were so accommodating and have great beer and wine choices! If you haven't been here yet, check it out you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Loyalist is a new modern provisions market in Mathews.  They have a nice counter and ample seating for lunch and dinner.  So, I really like this type of place, I will admit ahead of time, just the setup and offerings are what I am all about.  The menu consists of meat and cheese boards, sandwiches and  a few apps and salads.  They follow that with a solid wine and beer selection, all in bottles and cans, no draft but not needed.  The alcohol is a small variety but high quality and clearly the product of someone that is making an effort to have good beer and wine.  We really enjoyed the meat and cheese plate we ordered.  The offerings were eloquently explained by our waitress.  The first thing we noticed was how plentiful the  accoutrements were on the board.  Marcona almonds, honey, lusty monk mustard, dried apricots and a few others.  It was a solid selection of two meats and three cheeses, including a smoked blue cheese that was something I have never had.  We watched what appeared to be the owner making a huge catering board that looked incredible.   I grabbed a half pound salami and Benton's bacon to go as well, the wife got some UAV ricotta.  We can't wait to go back, I love this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch Saturday afternoon and loved hanging out at this gorgeous, new Matthews spot. The interior is pristine, white subway tile and gleaming metal slicers as far as the eye can see. We sat at the bar and had friendly, attentive service. It was fun to watch the crew working behind the counter. The owner was even assembling a meat and cheese platter for a special order that was seriously a work of art. I even commented on how I wouldn't be able to eat the first piece, it was just so beautiful. 

I enjoyed a glass of red wine and Ted downed a few IPAs. Alcohol selection was solid all around. It would be fun if they eventually got a few draughts! We shared the meat and cheese board. Everything was delicious and so thoughtfully paired. The blue cheese with oat cakes and goat milk caramel was my favorite pair. Not far behind was the salami and honey. We took a couple meats and a container of UAV ricotta home to enjoy later. 

So looking forward to The Loyalist Market becoming a regular hang out spot for us. We loved it so much, I even told my husband, \"I could live in Matthews.\""}
{"text":"Great local spot in downtown Matthews.  Friendly, laid back atmosphere.  They specialize in cheese and charcuterie options but also have sandwich and small plates.  The owner Christopher has a background in charcuterie and is qualified to give good wine selection combinations.

For lunch, i tried the Queens Charlotte Pimento Cheese sandwich special.  It was delicious! 

They have a small grocery selection with items such as jams, gourmet crackers, etc. You can tell from talking to the staff that a lot of research and thought has gone into selecting the items they sell.

Look for wine tasting events as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful variety of local and imported cheeses and meats! Lots of gourmet and specialty items!"}
{"text":"Cute shop. Very friendly staff and owner. I ordered the Fig and Pig salad and it was so delicious. They have a nice lunch menu with a variety of sandwiches that come with a side of salad or chips that range from 8-13 dollars. I also got a big chocolate chip cookie they they get locally. Love this place will be back!!"}
{"text":"Loved it-much needed in Matthews, beer, wine, charcuterie tray, artisan sandwiches, and grocery/deli to go. Cool new ingredients in the grilled cheese, tapenade muffuletta, and kettle chips 

Parking lot, casual dress, super nice owners, sit at bar, communal table or outside."}
{"text":"Delicious and well selected meats and cheeses. Seating (lack of tables) and service (a little snooty) leave much to be desired, but I think that will improve as they learn. Hoping the kinks are just being worked out. The boards could be better portions for the price, but I'm so happy to have a place like this here in Charlotte. I really hope this review is constructive because this has sooo much potential with a few tweaks."}
{"text":"First off, customer service is great. The owner came out and talked to us, the wait staff was very friendly and it made for a fun and enjoyable experience. Patio area is great - and they have heaters for the cooler weather! 
They change their cheese boards almost daily so you shouldn't get board. The blue cheese was amazing and they have a great wine and beer list. This place is new but I hope it stays around!!! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Have been following The Loyalist Market since they opened and finally got by there today and was NOT disappointed! Chris and everyone there were so nice and so helpful with cheese tasting and selection! The Ruben and grilled cheese sandwiches were amazing! Loved the beer and wine selection. So glad they're here! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Top notch find in Matthews! The Loyalist Market is a great spot for any occasion. 

We went in with a group of 6 and sat at the large family style table they have inside, there is additional seating at smaller tables and at the bar. The space is clean and inviting, brightly lit with an open concept setup. 

The customer service was amazing, everyone there was friendly and knowledgeable about their products. They gave great recommendations on beer, wine and of course--CHEESE. 

We ordered the devils on horseback and they were delicious. Crispy, served hot and super flavorful. One order comes with 5, I absolutely recommend it.

We also ordered a cheese and charcuterie board. It was beautifully structured, and everything was great. The experience of not just eating cheese--but eating cheese paired with different items to truly enhance the taste was so fun. We loved that it was a conversation piece, everyone wanted to discuss the pairings and compare the flavor profiles etc. 

Price is right on point for the quality of product you will receive."}
