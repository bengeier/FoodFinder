{"text":"I have to start by saying that on the night I ate here I had a reservation at Nota Bene for a long-anticipated date night with the husband, which was derailed by a last minute \"you must sign paperwork TONIGHT\" fiasco with our lawyer and mortgage broker.  So instead of dinner at Nota Bene, we signed 10 documents in triplicate at Bloor and Ossington, then wandered, starving, into the first place we saw that looked interesting.   It's definitely not fair to compare Queen of Sheba to Nota Bene, but in comparing it to other Ethiopian places I've eaten, in Toronto and elsewhere, it's really not in the same ballpark.    Do you want the good news or the bad news first?  Read bottom to top if you're a good news first kind of person.    The decor and cleanliness were really, really sketchy.  My husband and I (who were in a surprisingly good mood given the turn of events) commented that had it not been for fairly significant dining experiences in various developing countries, we would have high-tailed it out of there.  Just inside the front door we were greeted with the stale smell of cigarettes and just damp dirtiness; fortunately as we passed the kitchen and entered the dining room the smell greatly improved.  The carpeted(!) dining room was sorely in need of a shampoo.  The bathrooms were freezing cold and let's just say not spotless.  The paint in the dining room looked half-finished, with roller marks on the ceiling and some unfortunate color choices, and patches just not finished, like the painter quit half way through the job.  One upshot was the lighting, which was mostly from wall sconces pointing upward (not bad when ceiling mounted neon lights would have fit right in with the rest of the decor choices).  The service.  Oh God the service. She was pleasant but either really ditsy or really high.  My husband asked what the premium beers mentioned on the menu were and she just shrugged and said she didn't know.  In a  nice way, though.  When we told her we don't eat red meat and asked if we could do a platter that was a mix of chicken and veg she seemed sort of confused.  She suggested we do the mixed platter, but minus the beef and lamb, about which I sought to confirm that that might mean more chicken and veg given the absence of the other items.  To which she responded, nicely, no.  Being hungry and in no mood to be difficult, we just ordered the mixed platter of chicken, beef, lamb and vegetables, and I proceeded to eat red meat for the first time in 18 months.   The food was ok.  The beef was actually a highlight.  It was stewed in a dark sauce with a hint of sweetness.  The chicken was two drum sticks in a spicy sauce and the meat was tender and flavorful.  The lamb was nice as well, though the tender meat was done a disservice by a not very flavorful sauce.  The three vegetable dishes, a split pea, a lentil and a cabbage dish, were disappointingly bland (they made me glad we hadn't gone for the vegetarian platter).  And finally, the side plate of injera was right out of the refrigerator.  That sucked, actually.  The best thing I can say is that the price was right.  For a huge platter of food for two plus three beers it was $40 plus tip.  That's a pretty good savings versus what we would have spent at Nota Bene..."}
{"text":"I arrived at 12:35am (I phoned first) and they close at 1am, so that is the context of my review.  Obviously we (2) were in a rush, so we ordered the Queen of Sheba platter, their signatureish dish (a selection of meat and vegetarian options). It was $13 and fed both of us. The service was okay and the speed was quick. The food tasted good, but I have to say that the previous reviewers are absolutely correct when they say they must have toned the flavour down- I always thought Ethiopian food was often very spicy. It tasted good, but absolutely nothing was spicy. The food was dull but good. The place was really dirty, but that doesn't bother me much.  In conclusion, I might some day go back to try one of the specific dishes; on the other hand, if I'm ever in the mood for Ethiopian, I'll probably try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Don't know what people are saying. Didn't read the reviews. I see your two stars. Don't care. I literally stop, right there, when I see what you rated it. No need for me to read. Got me?   Sheb is good. It's way better than that place down the street, people lined up to eat to food that tastes like Maggi powder or Aromat. Get yourself the veggie platter for how many are in your party--save one. Then get yourself an order of the Kitfo (leb-leb). I haven't been to African palace....but this place is also better than Lalibela.   here's the thing: the place looks terrible. Worse than any other restaurant I patronize on a regular basis. That's why YOU gave it a bad review. You were wrong, and you lose. We all like nice places to eat in. But they are never gonna have any money to renovate if you don't eat there. The veggie platter is good every single (expletive deleted) time."}
{"text":"Another good Ethiopian restaurant in the city. The service is a little slow and its a little difficult to get served quickly so be aware that it won't be a quick meal.  The food is really good. This place has the best Gomen (collard greens) I have ever tasted (in TO, NY and DC) Their Shiro (lentils) is great too and there was a sizzling dish (can't remember the name) that was fantastic. Skip the ethiopian wine - it is way too sweet. Any light beer pairs well with the food.   Will definitely go back - perfect for a cold winter evening :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, but in the same way that I love Chinese food courts: it's cheap, it's decent, and no waiting (relative to other Ethiopian places, the service is lightening fast).  I've taken friends here several times in the past few years and have always been pleased with the results. That said, I totally agree with the other reviewers who say that they seemed to have really turned the flavour down on their dishes. I went a couple of weeks ago and the flavours were pretty muted (save the lamb) and the price of beer went from $3 to something closer to $5.   Cutting out flavour and making drinks expensive is not a good way to convince me to go back there. I might just have to return to Ethiopia House, 50 minute waits be damned."}
{"text":"I was here with a 4 friends to celebrate one of my best friend's birthday, although he sort of let it slip since we were not actually going out for that -- he is very private that way.   Anyway, the original plan was to go to Nazareth, however due to the good food and inexpensive price point, Nazareth is renown for its ridiculous waiting times to get a table.   Sadly, we were caught in that role and although we were promised a table, it was most likely to be available by the time some of the girls would have had the risk of  dealing with osteoporosis.   As such, the birthday boy recommended walking here as he vouched for the taste and promised an equal experience.   The place was empty except for the cook/server/manager/owner(?) and a gentleman nurturing a beer at the bar in front.   Long story short: the service was continental drift slow. In fact I had to walk over to tell the server we wanted drinks and remind her that we were ready to order. All in all, my experience of Ethiopian restaurants is that their service tends to be somewhat sub par, I do not know why, they just seem to come across as inattentive and The Queen Of Sheba did not disappoint.  The food itself took forever. As if the doors of the kitchen were a mystical portal to the luscious fields of Africa, full of adventure, sun and the cradle of humanity. As if the veggies were foraged from the rolling hills and flat lands of the continent's savannah, always mindful of the meandering eyes of predators and scavengers...      Meanwhile back in Toronto, we were starving.   For real, how long does it take to put some veggies (wot) on an injera? Even if the Injera is made on the spot? I mean, there was no one else ordering food in the whole restaurant!   We were there for about 2+ hours and it took almost a\n hour for us to get our food. If it was not because the birthday boy wanted to have Ethiopian and the conversation was good we would have probably had left. I might have.   Would I recommend the place? I am troubled. It was tasty --or perhaps it was because we were starving? Unfortunately the spice was a bit on the bland side which was good since I was the only one in the group that is big on spicy food so I thought it okay for the sake of my companions but if I went with people who like their food really spicy then I would have gone elsewhere.   There are just too many other restaurants that are better."}
{"text":"The lacklustre decor and the server's abrupt manner in showing us to our table could have been overlooked had the food been outstanding.  But no.   Some meat entrees were overcooked, the salad portion appeared dumped from a plastic bag from NoFrills, and the individual servings seemed slung onto the soggy injera as if being hurled by a stubbly-faced GI in a sweaty T-shirt on some M*A*S*H* rerun.  Spice?  Absent.  Paper napkins on stained linen tablecloth.   But the most mortal sin was not when the server mistook my date's order of white house wine for red, but when she actually began to insist that we take the red anyway, and that we should \"because no one else will drink it.\"  *blink*blink* Um.  No.  You know, as a people, Canadians are very relaxed in the face of inconvenience and unfairness.  I mean, you guys tolerate dry pizza, politicians snorting coke or taking bribes in parking lots, and pay ridiculous bank fees without so much as a blink.  But it made me wonder: has the Canadian sense of tolerance become so ingrained that a high-school age restaurant server can find it in herself to insist that paying diners accept not only what they hadn't ordered, but because others wouldn't want it either?  Can you say, \"Not my problem?\"  Try it, Canadians. Ain't hard.  You'll be glad you did.   This Queen deserves a beheading."}
{"text":"As soon-to-be new members of Dufferin Grove, my future roomie and I set out to see what was good in the the hood. I knew from a quick peruse of googlemaps that there were 3 Ethiopian places near by, so we thought we'd give that a try.   Our first stop, regrettably, was The Queen of Sheba. My friend looked a bit skeptical gazing up at the signage but I began to pursuade her; in my experience dingey storefront  = authentic food, a sentiment echoed by a quote in the newspaper review that had been blown up and posted in the window. I pointed this out to my friend, who quipped 'And when was this article written?' 1986, it turns out. I think a lot has changed since then...  Despite the two people relaxing behind the bar, we were not greeted. Only after we piped up, 'Should we sit in the back?' did a woman silently pick up menus and seat us. Walking further into the restaurant, we were greeted very quickly this time: by a DANK SMELL. 'I think they own a dog,' my friend noted quietly. A wet one. Who lives within the walls and carpets.   Although it was very dim, we were still able to see visible filth. There was a fine layer of grime on everything, and sticky residue and crumbs on our table-- the entire restaurant was empty, but we had been seated at an unwiped table.   Not wanting to rudely just walk out, we thought we'd order a beer and go. It took them forever to respond to our request for the bill, even though we were still the only people in the restaurant. I honestly regret staying, and I have no idea why I was compelled to tip. The food could be great for all I know, but I would never order there. I have frequented many a hole-in-the-wall, but I have never seen a restaurant this dirty in all of Canada."}
{"text":"Yahweh save the queen. It's been a long time since I've been to the Queen of Sheba, at one time one of Toronto's best Ethiopian restaurants. When last I peeked in on the Queen, it was on the north side of Bloor. They seem to have moved to the south side in the last, oh, 10 years. And they've gone south a mite, I'll say.   Prices are still cheap. Decor wise they've taken a step down. Flavor wise, they've tamed the spice. It wasn't quite the flavor explosion Ethiopian typically delivers with every injera powered scoop.  The mango/guava juice is a tad over priced. $3.00 a glass, poured from a 1 l tetra pack you can get at the grocery store for $2.00. You can get about 3 glasses from one of those tetra packs. So that's a 450% mark up. So I'd pass on that."}
{"text":"I dunno about this place.  In a city full of outstanding Ethiopian food, this place is merely ho-hum.     The Injera was soggy.  The food seemed to be lacking in spice.    The environment did not stimulate conversation the way that most good communal food restaurants do.  Dollar store artwork lined the walls.  Entirely forgettable."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I've always enjoyed a great meal for excellent value.  The service has always been prompt & friendly.  Sounds like they may have had a bad employee at one point from some other reviewers, but I've never experienced bad service.  I usually get the mixed platter or veggie platter, and while I enjoyed both, I'd probably opt for the mix platter in the future.  I find the meat dishes are flavoured with a tad more oomph than the veggie dishes so I'd rather have the mix of the two.  Yes, the decor is old and tired, but they usually have good music playing with a hint of frankincense in the air."}
{"text":"This is a good standby restaurant.  This was a time that I was in Toronto, well before I met my wife.  I have traveled to Toronto many times.  This time, I was having dinner, alone.  The food was good, and was a \"comfort\" food for me.  I am not Ethiopian, but this sometimes how I view Ethiopian food.    My girlfriend at the time, a native Torontonian, just dumped me about an hour earlier.  She dumped me for someone else.    I was eating the vegetarian combo."}
