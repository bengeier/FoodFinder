{"text":"Saw this place while driving down Lorain Rd,  looked up the menu and decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed! They offer full Chinese and Japanese menus- we ordered some spring rolls, sushi (California roll) and entrees (Triple Delight and the Seafood Teriyaki). The portions were generous and the food was delicious. Wendy took great care of us and was very friendly. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi I have had in a Chinese and sushi restaurant. The food is fabulous and the service is great. I love their Eel maki roll it's great. Their chicken teriyaki is the best. I recommend you guys come and try it."}
{"text":"I can't comment on their Chinese menu, but their Japanese food was not great. The miso soup was watery. I tried a mexican roll and a yellowtail roll. Fish was at, or maybe slightly above, grocery store sushi quality. The mexican roll had just a tiny sliver of avocado. Yellowtail roll was small and a bit sloppily made. No presentation at all (plain white plates, no garnish - not even shredded daikon or green plastic grass dividers). No complaints or compliments on the service or decor. Just very plain, like the food."}

{"text":"Got to go out to 70 Chinese and Sushi restaurant last night. Wow! the food is fabulous! Best place to go to either before or after a movie! The owner is a wonderful hostess... she's so nice and personable. It's about time North Olmsted got a premium Chinese restaurant in town! I'd recommend everybody go there...you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I ordered from both the Chinese and Japanese menu.   The several sushi that I got from the Japanese menu were alright, tasted slightly better than Japanese food you'd get from a cheap Chinese buffet. But the price was decent.  The couple entrees that I got from the Chinese menu, however, were disappointing. The sauce just tasted odd to me. The fried rice tasted like it was made with well used oil, very unappetizing. I also had the hot and sour soup, tasted very plain. The portion of the Chinese entrees were big, price again was decent. I am a fan of Americanized Chinese food myself, and I'd say the food here from the Chinese menu is below average.   Service was 10/10, the girl who works there is very sweet.  There are a surprisingly high number of Chinese restaurants in the area, and this one did not stand out."}

{"text":"Good quality and LOTS of food!  Our server was very nice but didn't know the menu very well and felt that she forgot about us even though we were the only customers. Never got refills on our drinks and were very thirsty when we left. Overall good place.  Will definitely order for pick up again."}
