{"text":"So I'm writing this In real time while having lunch here for the first time. Some neighbors recommended it and if you've ever been to Waunakee you know that pickings are slim when it comes to restaurants. So you walk in and are greeted to a very clean and friendly Mexican style restaurant. I was seated immediately and had chips and salsa all within about a minute. The chips are warm and the salsa cold and fresh. You can see and taste the fresh cilantro. The server comes over and asks me what I would like to drink and hands me a fairly large menu, he then points out the lunch menu on the back saving me from studying the menu. A couple minutes later my sprite arrives, again in a very nice clean glass. Soda to syrup mix is good. I decide to have the lunch steak fajitas as I continue to much down the chips... Lunch comes pretty quick I've taken a pic of the plate... Everything was the right temp and the food was flavorful. The rice was firm, the refried beans are made with a nice consistency. The veggies and meat had a nice char and spice. All in all a good meal, now the real test will come when I bring the wife and kids!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow service.  Took about an hour to get our food. Lots of uncleared tables made dining room look messy."}
{"text":"The service was great, the menu and food were good.  Everything came quickly and we had a great experience.  This is a great addition to Verona."}
{"text":"This use to be my families go to place for good food and good service. Something seems to have happened because it now has poor service and bad food. The prices increased and the staff is no longer the friendly attentive staff that we use to get. There is never enough waitstaff, you have to ask the waitstaff for everything from silverware to drink refills. We use to go once a week, we now go just to finish off a gift certificate someone gave us. We don't recommend this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison area.  Food and drinks are priced well and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"Used to be great. Another reviewer mentioned a change in ownership, that explains everything.  Cuco's was great but earlier this year it really went downhill.  Prices went up and service got poor. I used to go there once a week or so but have almost completely stopped going because it's just not enjoyable anymore."}
{"text":"We like to go to Cuco's because we live down the street from it. The food is GREAT but the service is terrible. 8 out of 10 times my food is incorrect when it comes out or the server asks questions that don't pertain to what I'm ordering. Besides strange service their drinks are never made correctly and the manager or owner is very strange and follows the workers around. The food is good but the rest is just BLAH."}
{"text":"Well, I diverted from the main highway specifically to go to this restaurant because YELP states they were open until 10:30 PM. We roll into the parking lot, and the stickers on the door say Fri-Sat: 11am-10: 0pm. The beer and open signs are off, but the door is unlocked and we can see some people dining inside. The hostess gave a strange look, so we asked if they were open, and we were informed they were not. This happened at 9:40pm. So... Apparently... 10: 0pm is not to be interpreted as 10:30pm... But as 9 o'whateverwefeellike."}
{"text":"Consistent, yummy, and standard Mexican food in Wisconsin. Margs are way better than most and that salsa is dope. Can't argue with that."}
{"text":"My family has eaten here 3 times in the past month and both the food and service has been excellent. Fresh chips and salsa has been present each time, and wait staff have been attentive in providing more. I love the shrimp chimichanga and have ordered it twice. Generous amount of very fresh shrimp in a light yet crisp shell. The steak burritos are highly recommended - the steak used is much better quality than I have experienced in other area Mexican restaurants. This has quickly become our favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"A nice addition to Verona's culinary offerings. Friendly and accommodating staff, large menu, and competitive prices make this place a keeper. The food reminded me of places like Laredos but the complimentary chips and salsa were both very bland."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service is terrible.  I didn't get the water I requested and had to ask for chips and salsa (which is normally a standard in every Mexican restaurant I've been to).  Then I see that we got charged $3.50 for the chips and salsa. It was more expensive than my beer!  The fastest part of our night was when she brought the bill....go figure.  I will only be doing take out from this place from now on."}
{"text":"Not good. Extremely bland and a waste of money. My Mexican quesadilla was made with mozzarella cheese....no spices or flavor or anything. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The good? 36 ounce beers

The bad? Everything else. 

It was only a quarter full but took 45 top get the very much below average Mexican food.   Not only was it cold, but it came our in waves over 15 minutes.   I'm sorry too say it because I love most of the Mexican food in the area, but this was sloppy, over cooked, and bland.  The tamales were like mashed potatoes!  The service was so bad.   We barely saw our waitress.   The four of us were initially greeted with one bowl of chips and one small salsa.   After we asked for more. .. two more times, we finally received another small dish of salsa.  After we finished our food and still hadn't seen our waitress for 20 min we flagged down the manager.   He asked how our dinner was and we said not good. ...\"oh, ok\" was the response.   He then leaves without another word.   Really?? A table full of dirty dishes half filled with sub par food... He leaves.  

Let's just say I would highly recommend spending your money at any other restaurant in Dane county.   WOW!"}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. The steak fajita meat was full of gristle and I had to spit out every piece I tried to chew. The waitress had trouble understanding English when I told her about it. There was no apology or attempt to substitute another menu item or removal from bill. The other members of my party disliked their entrees too. While the margarita was strong, the cheap tequila gave the drinker a stomach ache. Perhaps WI does not know what good Mexican food is like."}
{"text":"Went to Cuco's for dinner... Food came out fast and the portions were great. Service was polite and friendly. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Pretty affordable and nice staff. Only negative is they charge extra for things like sour cream...."}
{"text":"Below average in most aspects, service, food, and atmosphere. What they have going for them is price and lack of competition in Verona in this price range. Great lunch spot, but coffee was cold and apps got to the table before the drinks!"}
{"text":"If you come here, do not go for the normal combination dinners. The meat is barely spiced, and the sauce on my burrito tasted closer to marinara than anything else. The salsa was also quite bland. Service was good though. My friend tried the fajitas, and those were also not bad. Still, I would see no reason to come here if I did not work in Verona. There are much better places in Madison."}
{"text":"We have been a couple of times and food is good.  We visited on 5/5/2016 and when my daughter ordered she clearly stated no beans and rice in her burrito.  Our food came out and there were beans and rice in her burrito, when we brought it to the servers attention and asked for a new order she said ok and then came back and told us because of how busy they were they couldnt make her a new order. I have never been to eat somewhere where that was the reply.  Very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mexican food, so of course when we moved to Waunakee; we had to try Cuco's! 

What Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa?!?

We were seated and then it took a long while to even get drinks. They were the smallest drinks ever. By the time the server came to take our order, we needed refills. Try never came. Our food was so bland! It had no seasoning on it at all. Probably the worst chimichanga I've ever had. Maybe we came on an off night, but i don't  think we will be back."}
{"text":"Their food is really good here! I come here quite a bit. Their service is pretty fast and it can be busy here. They don't have delivery but they do have an option for pickup. I enjoy the chips and salsa. That's really good! The waiting staff was extremely nice and friendly. The restaurant itself was pretty clean and it smells delicious in there! The place was really casual and mellow. They have TV's there so you can watch the game and just hang out. There's a lot of seating available for a small place and didn't feel cramped in there. Bathrooms were alright not entirely disgusting or even disgusting at all depending on your standards. I'm never there too long that I would have to use the restroom but have been in there to wash my hands. They have a really nice menu and food always seems delicious. I wasn't a fan of the tamales but I haven't had much of those to be a good judge for those. I would definitely come here again. It's fast and convenient and filling!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise in Waunakee!

Authentic food with a broad menu of choices.  The chips are always fresh as is the salsa.  Try the molcahete for a great combination of meats, cactus, green onion and avocado in a hot lava parillada style dish.  One order is enough for two people, just order some extra tortillas.

If you want something simpler get the grilled chicken tacos a la carte.  Great little pieces of juicy grilled chicken in two tortillas.

I have been to at least ten different Mexican restaurants in the Madison area and this one tops them all."}
{"text":"Cucos is my favorite Mexican restaurant so far on the west side of town.  Having just moved to the area, there's a lot still to explore, but it's hard when I already like Cucos so much and is right down the road! 
Pros:  Staff is very friendly; fairly inexpensive menu; margaritas are a steal; salsa is very good and fresh guac is outstanding; never have to wait for a table
Cons:  The interior decor is something to be desired, but I think they must have taken over another bar/business; wish they had a larger outdoor patio that didn't overlook the parking lot

It's unfortunate for some of the negative reviews.  I'm somewhat of a foodie and have been eating Mexican all my life.  I think the food has been good!  Not great, but you're not paying for great either.  It's all relative.

Update:  Since my initial review, I noticed some changes in the menu.  They must have switched chefs or food suppliers because there is a difference in the quality now.  The salsa doesn't seem as fresh, and some of the menu items are just different.  As a result, I dropped it 1 star."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food. Good service. Fun atmosphere. Nice location. The chips are thin, warm and crispy and the salsa is fresh, yummy and has a little kick but not too spicy or salty at all. I love their shredded beef chimichangas. Soooooo good. They come with white cheese sauce poured all over them and they're loaded with mostly just the beef which is super flavorful and juicy but not wet. The rice is good too! Nothing fancy but mild and nicely seasoned. My husband gets their burritos and hasn't found one yet that he didn't enjoy. Oh and their side of guacamole is perfection. No jalapeños! Yay! Just fresh sweet onion, lime, salt and Cilantro. Just how I love it. We went at 1:00 on a Saturday and it was dead. Come on peeps. Don't let this place close down. They also have outdoor seating! Keep up the good work, Cuco's!"}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch on Sat.  Service was pretty good and the food was OK but not fantastic..  Overall I'd give them a C."}
{"text":"In Verona there are far too few options for Mexican food, and Cuco is the closest around. My experiences are mostly that of take-out lunches, and for that they're pretty solid. Reasonable pricing and the staff is pretty friendly. The quality of food is average with that of a Laredo's. The speed at which everything is made is quite good - take out orders are a 10 minute wait, and sit-down meals take about 10 to 15 minutes to cook. It all tastes pretty decent and the building itself looks alright. Plenty of seating all around and a fairly nice bar for Verona."}
{"text":"The food was bland and the service was okay. We had to clarify our various orders a couple of times. And, the plates were far too warm to indicate freshly made in the kitchen. 

Our waitress tried to make up for the various issues but I don't know if we'll go back. 

Best intentions but there are other options in the area."}
{"text":"Good typical Mexican food. Good taste good service very clean. For a storefront restaurant in a small town it is better Mexican than you would expect."}
{"text":"Service can be hit or miss, but the food is always good.  The people are always super friendly, but service can be slow.  Price, quality and serving size are all in line here.  The atmosphere is really laid back, with the occasional \"fun loving\" crowd at happy hour.  Cuco's is actually a great place for a family meal and they do really well with small kids.

Free bottomless chips and salsa pretty much gets any restaurant off to a good start in my book.  Margaritas are on par with your typical Mexican place.  My experience with main courses here is pretty limited as I really enjoy the pollo fundito and pork burrito el roqueta.  I have a hard time deviating from these favorites.

I wouldn't go in expecting a life changing meal, but this place is a really good local Mexican restaurant with friendly staff, good food and a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a while. Food was very middle of the road. Saturday night, restaurant not quite half full. Service was nearly non-existent. The only upside was we did finally get food."}
{"text":"My family is quite the fan of this place. Yes its not the most authentic Mexican food but we live in Verona, we take what we can get. I think they have great salsa, and the're fajita anything is great! Even tho the waiters don't speak very good english we've never had a problem custom ordering things for my picky fiancee and they are always friendly. 
Each table has a unique theme so always nice to have things to look at and talk about over dinner. 
It's too bad Pasqual's is open right around the corner but I don't think they are going to hurt business any. :)"}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican food. My fiancé ordered camarones a la diabla and they used the same salsa they gave us with the chips. So gross! How is this place still open?"}
{"text":"One of the most friendliest service and great food! Also, go there often!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fresh yummy breakfast on the weekend in Waunakee you must try Cuco's. They have your traditional American breakfast choices or some tasty Mexican dishes. The food is fresh and comes out sizzling hot. 

The service is excellent and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Cuco's service deserves a zero-star rating, but some of their food redeems them to two stars (still nothing to brag about...).  My wife and I ate here shortly after they opened and were disgusted by the slow, uncaring service.  The food was alright--rather bland--but hearing \"oh, I forgot\" over and over from our server (when we could find her) made sure we didn't return until last night when we decided to give them another try.  Some things never change.....    The food was bland and the service was nonexistent.   We won't go back."}
{"text":"My family recently had a large family dinner gathering at Cuco's in Waunakee. While others in my party seemed satisfied with the taste and quality of their meals, I was highly disappointed with the shrimp cocktail. The sauce tasted to be tomato juice and ketchup - mostly ketchup. It was served only with saltines, so I asked for more chips. Having arrived last, I did not know that they were already advised that Cuco's charges for chips and salsa. Other family members had ordered a few baskets anyway, and rather than refilling those baskets, we were charged another $3.50 for more chips and salsa. Other issues with our orders: three family members ordered a double-sized fajita and were served a single. They were charged for another fajita, rather than the double because the server said they didn't order a double. My husband order a steak and 6-shrimp dinner, and was served only 5 shrimp. 
I don't think we'll be going back. Too many issues, and I'm still haunted by the awful ketchup taste."}
{"text":"Average.....at best. Went for dinner tonight with my wife and two kids. They did pretty well on service, the staff was friendly and attentive. The tortilla chips were stale and the salsa didn't have alot of flavor. My wife and I ordered strawberry margaritas, mine on the rocks, hers blended. After several minutes and what sounded like a blender over the wall by the bar, our server came back to inform us they couldn't blend anything, so she took hers on the rocks too. The drinks had too much sour mix in them and neither of us could taste any tequila. I'm still not sure why they add $.025 on the bill for the \"strawberry\", it looked like they had poured flavored soda in it, no fruit whatsoever. My wife's chicken fajita burrito had good taste but certainly wasn't the best ever.  My Cuco's Burrito was delicious but a little heavy on the cilantro. Bottom line, if you want to survive in Madison as a restaurant, you'd better master the basics and find a \"wow\" factor to keep people coming back. I'd consider giving them a second chance and maybe I will a long time from now, but there's much to choose from that excites me more."}
{"text":"Cuco's is a decent place to grab a meal. Good, but not great sums it up pretty well. The services is good, the tables are clean, the food is hot and pretty tasty. The margaritas we had were not very good, but I'll go back again and probably give them another try."}
{"text":"Service isn't anything special or great here, but the food has always been pretty solid. I always get the same thing every time, burritos a la roquetta with chicken, and it's pretty awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for decent tacos on the east side, and decided to give Cuco's a try. I called on a Saturday evening for a takeout order, the woman who answered was super friendly and said it would be about 30 minutes since they were 'busier than usual' - okay, no problem.

When I got there, it was a weird experience. They didn't really have a host stand set up, so I awkwardly stood by the door until a server noticed me. When I told them I had a takeout order, they seemed confused and led me over to the bar..okay.. I ended up standing there for about 20 minutes until a different employee came over with my food. 

I ordered the steak tacos and was pretty happy with them. They were served in corn tortillas with fresh pico - the meat was decent and they didn't skimp on the filling. I'd probably give them another try for takeout since they are so close to my house, but would never eat inside."}
{"text":"If you want to have Mexican in a Northwoods Inspired building go here. This place had to be a different restaurant and these guys didn't put any effort into changing it. Whatever I understand. I was hoping for a good meal, I really was. 

We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and the place had maybe 5 other tables filled which is nothing for the size of this restaurant. We sat down and ordered our sodas and reviewed the menus. I had the rolled quesadilla's and my fiancee had the Shrimp Chimichangas. Neither of us were impressed what so ever. 

The quesadilla was supposed to have cheese on top, it did not... The Chimichangas looked not so great and weren't quite done enough. There wasn't a whole lot of taste to the salsa or our entrees. I wouldn't go back, I'm sorry. I really was hoping for another great Mexican joint, this one does NOT fit the bill."}
{"text":"Cuco's is totally mediocre. The margaritas are pretty good, but the margarita sizing is quite goofy. The \"regular\" size is about 8 ounces, then the \"medium\" shoots up to nearly a fish bowl. Odd.

I've eaten at Cuco's on a handful of occasions. The service is always prompt, and the servers are fairly friendly but sometimes a little distant. The food, though, could use improvement. I've tried various enchiladas, tacos, quesadillas and burritos. Every dish sort of seems like a TV dinner. The food isn't bad, but it's definitely lacking in quality and flavor. 

More recently when I went to Cuco's, I ordered the spinach quesadilla. The server told me that was a good choice because the spinach at Cuco's was \"all natural.\" What does that mean? The spinach is organic? Raw and never frozen? Not canned? Not GMO? Locally grown by a local farmer? I find it a little frustrating that a restaurant would throw around trendy buzzwords about its food to its customers even though the buzzwords are ambiguously vague and don't help the customer understand anything about the food. Either say exactly what it is or say nothing at all.

Go to Cuco's for the margaritas, but don't expect incredible food."}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing!  Chips tasted a little oily, but all else was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wake up Madison & Verona. You need to experience Cuco's. Don't let the opportunity pass you by. Great authentic Mexican food. We've been five or six times and everything is a hit. Enchiladas, burritos, the molcajete is great (eat the cactus people!). Great service, extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food EVER..ordered enchilada got the wrong order..snotty slow hostess asked what my problem was. When I asked to talk to the manager she said he was not there. It was the dinner hour. Before going here take some bland cooked chicken throw it on a piece of White bread  pour salsa on that and save yourself $$"}
{"text":"The worst \"Mexican\" restaurant I've ever been to.  Taco Bell would be a much better option.  Chips/salsa cost $3.50, have to ask for water and silverware, scalding hot plates of TV dinner quality food.  We were the only table on a Saturday night at 7pm.  I can understand why.  Don't make the same mistake we did."}
{"text":"Passable Mexican food. I've only ordered carry-out food from this restaurant. Family ate the tamales, beef enchiladas, enchiladas suizas, and burrito Cuco's. Carry out comes with chips, salsa. Not all entrees come with the standard rice and beans, so it pays to ask, rather than be disappointed. 

Uninspired vegetarian options on the menu, but no vegan options. Pass up the cheese enchilada, which is just melted cheese in a tortilla. Bean burrito is just beans in a tortilla, no onions, etc. Carry-out orders have an additional 25¢ fee per item. 

Nice to have a Mexican restaurant in town, but it's nothing *special,* which is too bad. Of course, it gives me more local take-out food options, so I'll be back. If I want a night out, though, I'll drive to Madison, Middleton."}
{"text":"Tried not to honor 3.5 month old gift certificate due to change in ownership. BS... you honor the gift certificate regardless of who owned the place when the GC was purchased. Only eventually took it because we made a scene and we're not scene making type people. The manager/owner also put the tip cash in the register. Unfortunate that they have the opportunity to operate a business in this wonderful country and they try to screw its people."}
{"text":"We loved this place when it first opened.  Then, the prices increased so noticeably that we reconsidered if we should dine out or not.  We try this only about once per year now and for the last three times we are convinced this place is not for us.  Mostly for food & beverage to value ratio.  The food is good and there are many variations on the menu, however, we find it overpriced.  This is also the first Mexican fare restaurant that charges for chips & salsa(that isn't divulged either until you get the bill), we haven't experienced that before.   We can find a better value nearby."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting here in the middle of the afternoon.  The staff was very accommodating and kept our beverages full while we worked away! The food was pretty good.  There chips are extra yummy.   It was very cold in the building and that was tough because it was freezing cold day outside.  I would return."}
{"text":"Service was fast and prompt, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food is decent. However, the reason why I'm only giving 3/5 stars is because the menu is frustrating. Apparently you can't order Mole Enchiladas from the combo menu. It costs extra..? Yet you can order Mole Enchiladas from a different section of the menu without problem? I had to order my two Enchiladas and one beef taco a la carte. Its sauce in a bin, why not just pour that on instead of whatever the main sauce is? There's no reason to complicate the menu like that.

Anyway if you're interested in a decent place with decent prices, and if you like the queso Mexican cheese this place is for you. But if you're like me and don't settle for basic ground beef meals/red sauce/and topping-less nachos... Don't bother."}
{"text":"This place is very good but not great.  At least not yet.   Watch for improvements because the staff seemed to be interested in what drew us to the restaurant.   We hope they continue to do all they are doing right and seek to improve their restaurant even more.
We were greeted promptly by two young ladies at the entrance with big smiles and both were dressed sharply and professionally.   This is always the way to start a nice dinner experience.   We were seated promptly and while sitting down a gentleman showed up with tortillas and salsa and our menu.   Not a minute later another gentleman was ordering our drinks.   Maybe it was the same man, it all went so quickly.    The salsa by the way had a very good flavor and mild.
Since this was our first time here we decided to go with dishes we have ordered in the past at other Mexican restaurants.    One dish was with chicken and the other was with shrimp.   Our waiter did not speak English well at all so it was hard to qualify some of our order but usually this is not a big deal for us as it might be important for some people.
While waiting we noticed the tables were sports bar themed.  Jim Rome was featured along with a photo of some cheerleaders that my wife covered up with a napkin.  Ha.  It was a bit distracting and not complementary to the atmosphere.  This place used to be a sports bar and restaurant and we think they bought the place with the tables.   All fine and good but either use tablecloths or re-theme the tops of the tables please.  (Neither of us are big fans of sports bars so this was a big turnoff for us when we are looking for a Mexican-like eating experience.  Yeah, yeah, I know that this is a sort of Americanized version of Mexico but go with it.)  Mexican music played in the background at a nice volume level.
Our dishes came quickly and were really beautifully put together.   We were really happy about this.   Everything was hot.   
Everything but the rice tasted good to very good.   The best was the Pollo Norteno and it's sauce was absolutely excellent.  The rice was kind of bland and not very flavorful.  There is some habanero sauce on the table that you can use to kick up the heat but go easy.   It is pretty hot stuff.
On our way out were were questioned with interest about our experience and thanked graciously.
We look forward to their continued success.

Went back recently for carry out.   Everything was set up nicely.   But I did notice their vents are filthy dirty in the foyer.   Tsk, tsk.   They need to do something about that or their stars are going down.   I want a clean restaurant from top to bottom or I'm not eating there.  Why?  Because if you don't notice this and I as a customer do what does this say about what you miss in the back kitchen?  Please Cucos, clean your vents and all restaurants out there, do a quick walk around and see the things that need to be cleaned.   ugh."}
{"text":"We were excited about having a Mexican place near by when we moved to Waunakee, but this place was terrible. Service was poor, food forgotten, no drinks. Worst of all was the food. Clearly came off the Sysco truck. Could have made better at home. Hard to find a positive here. Even our kids said they never want to go back."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise.  I was looking for another restaurant that must have closed and came across Cuco's by accident.  The décor is definitely kid friendly, they have toys and things to occupy the little ones.  

They serve chips and fresh salsa which was delicious.  I had one of the combination plates and the food was excellent.  The portion is quite large, so you will not leave hungry.  The price was very reasonable and the service was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. Thought we'd try a new place. The place was nearly empty but we were a bit early for lunch. I was very excited when the chips and salsa were brought to the table before we had ordered. The chips were disappointing in that they tasted as though they had been fried in old oil. They had a bad greasy taste to them. We both ordered the fajita taco salad; mine with shrimp, my husband's with chicken. Both were absolutely terrible. Again the fried tortilla bowl had a bad greasy taste and the \"salad\" inside the bowl was  unrecognizable. We had a hard time determining which salad had shrimp and which had chicken. Once that was sorted out we noticed neither had guacamole as described in the menu and I could only find a small smear of sour cream on my salad. The worst part was that I came across what looked like a green bean. Setting it aside I continued to eat and then found a pea. Curious now we both set to digging through the muck in our bowls and both of us found several green beans and peas. In a fajita taco salad? We were so shocked we started to wonder where the salad \"filling\" had come from. Who puts green beans and peas in a taco salad? These certainly were not mentioned in the description on the menu. We were both put off by these odd veggies that we could not finish. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"First visit to Cuco's Mexican Restaurant in Waunakee.  Not too busy when we arrived, greeted by friendly server and seated right away.  Ordered a couple of house margarita's, although they were tasty they are small.  Asked if we would like some salsa and chips, \"sure\" we responded - only to find that we were charged for them on our bill.  I tried the Pollo Fundido and \"she\" had the shrimp chimichangas - our meals were good but not great.  I never like to judge the quality of the food and the quality of the experience by the amount of the bill, but in this case I have to say the food quality doesn't match the $65 spent for two with a couple of margaritas...and chips and salsa and extra sour cream.   With all that said, our server was friendly and attentive, food was average, and experience was average at best.  I think they can do better."}
{"text":"Food was decent - but nothing amazing.

There are a lot of comments on here about poor service, but our service was fine.  The waiter wasn't the quickest to refill sodas, but that was about the worst of it."}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food, we did live in Phoenix for 2 years after all! We loved cucos! The decor was more north woods than Mexican, but it gave the place a Wisconsin-Esque charm that we loved. The chips and salsa were free, bottomless, and tasty! I got a combination platter of a quesidilla, burrito, and enchilada and each one was delicious! Guac also came with the entree, which was nice as most places charge extra. All entrees were very affordable. Service was a bit slow but very friendly, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  We sat on the patio which was very nice.  The service was excellent, fast and very polite.  The food was cooked very quick (be careful the plates are very hot...they tell you in the menu and when they give you the food).  I had the chorizo tacos which were delicious!!!  My sister had the enchiladas, I wasn't a fan of the sauce but she really liked them."}
{"text":"Cuco's is a decent place.  The food is pretty consistently decent.  The service is decent and their drinks are decent.  I have had a lot of things on their menu and the food is far from authentic but it's decent.  They also have decent margaritas.  One thing that I'm not in love with at Cuco's is how overly salted everything is.  There is really not much to say outside of just noting that the place is decent. 

One thing that is kind of standout at the restaurant however is this dish that comes in a stone pig shaped pot.  It has chicken, chorizo, steak, and shrimp and is served with avocado slices and rice with beans.  It's pretty freaking good.  It's also pretty freaking salty but still really good.  It is enough for 2 people which should mean that the man and I split it.  But it doesn't.  He eats all he can and looks forward to taking the rest home for breakfast the next day.  He does let me have a few bites of it, only sometimes though!

If you want decent Mexican food and a decent atmosphere with decent service come to Cuco's you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'd love to support a local business but wow, what a mess here! Don't expect quality, tasty food, or for your order to be right. Don't expect it to be fast, and definitely expect to be charged extra per entree for your carry-out order. Portion sizes are pathetic. 

We will avoid cuco's waunakee location. Don't recommend at all."}
{"text":"Waitstaff couldn't be more UNhappy to see you. Pay for chips/salsa? Charge for extra sour cream & beans side equaled close to an entree'. Food bland, microwaved for sure (had scalding spots and cold spots, that takes doing ). Workers do NOT seem happy or appreciative of business, so I'll drive a few miles where I won't feel I'm intruding."}
{"text":"I've been living in the Madison area for about 6 years and in Verona for over 4.  I've been to many of the Mexican restaurants in the area, including large, medium, and \"hole in the wall\".

I've now been to Cuco's around 7-8 times and believe it's one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Madison area.  The service is always super fast, the atmosphere is decent, the food is great, and prices very reasonable.  My wife and I also like their margaritas.

I'm often a creature of habit when it comes to restaurants, but I've had fun trying a variety of items at Cuco's, all have been great.  I really like their Chile Rellanos.  I also recommend trying a few of their specialties.  For a twist on Fajita, I recommend trying their Molcajeta.  I also really enjoyed their Burrito Cuco's.

If you're really hungry, the Especial Grande will do the trick...but don't be surprised when they bring out two large plates of food!  All for around $12."}
{"text":"We just recently moved to the area and wanted a quick bite to eat. We live around the block, so we figured this would be a convenient take-out place. Ordered the chicken tacos and the meat wasn't even seasoned...huge disappointment. Also ordered the Choripollo and it came out looking like the complete opposite the menu description.  Neither dish seemed to have any seasoning/spices and the salsa was essentially ketchup, absolutely no flavor or spice at all. 

Overly priced for very cheap and flavorless Mexican cuisine. Would not recommend if you have ever eaten truly authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place three stars because the service is pretty darn good. But the food is just sub par compared to the other choices in Madison. I had a combination platter of a burrito, taco, and tostada. It was very bland and didn't seem to have much flavor at all.  I would compare this place to a restaurant like Pedro's.  It's Fast, Cheap, and just OK."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Atmosphere is great and kid friendly. Great kids menu in fact. Well kept secret. Definitely recommend a visit here."}
{"text":"Terrible. We ordered take out and upon paying realized that they charged us $0.50 for each item that we ordered because it was to-go...it wasn't a huge deal but annoying since they didn't mention that when we ordered. We also thought that maybe it was for the containers, but they packed everything into as few containers as possible. 

Once we got home we opened the containers and were bitterly disappointed. I ordered a side each of rice and beans ($2.95 each) and received maybe a couple spoonfuls of each. My boyfriend ordered Chile Colorado ($10.25) and received less food than a typical kids meal. 

If the food was good, it might be worth the price but it certainly wasn't. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped to give this place a try on a weeknight. What awaited us?  Crickets. There was nobody at the host station. We waited about three minutes for a guy to walk up and ask us if we wanted food to go. Um, no?  Now in his defense we WERE getting SO bored waiting for anyone to acknowledge us that I grabbed a menu to peruse, but probs not the best question to ask Mr. Host!  Mr. Host was SO rude in seating us, grumbling and giving us rather terse looks even after I told him it was fine he mistook us for carryouters. Certainly no biggie for us. So anyway, we get seated. Waitress was wonderful.  Mr. Host was SO rude in seating us, grumbling and giving us rather terse looks even after I told him it was fine he mistook us for carryouters. . Food came pretty quickly, hot and... Wrong. I ordered the La Perfecta which was not perfecta.  I was supposed to get a beef burrito, a chicken enchilada and a beef avocado tostada. All my food was beef. Covered in a most disgusting white velveeta cheesy sauce. Don't get La Perfecta. Totally NOT perfecta. Quite frankly, with Mr. Host being so rude and angry, I was actually afraid to say anything about my meal being wrong. I think it may have been wrong on purpose. I'm not kidding. We finished our meals and had our fork and knife in the I'm done position. Mr. Host took my husband's plate and ignored mine surely not over his screw up and still VERY angry with me.  I don't have a clue why a HOST who made admittedly a stupid but honest mistake would hold such a vendetta. We didn't get it. We won't be back. Food is eh. We continue our search for a decent Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"What is happening in Waunakee? Terrible and inadequate service. A full house on a Thursday dinner and only one server. No offer of chips and salsa. Major disappointment and will not be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We were the first to arrive at dinner time. We ordered the kids milk. 10 minutes later I got up and had to look for a employee.  They were out of milk  so had to go shopping to get more. Didn't tell us, didn't bring us chips id take our order. The meal didn't get better from there.

This is the second time we tried here, last time we said we'd never come back. Should have listened to ourselves."}
{"text":"If you want some comfort food Cucos is a great place to go. Authentic good food. And now they serve breakfast although a little late to open it's a good solid menu with variety and heart!"}
{"text":"I normally don't write bad experiences unless you really hit it out of bounds.  

I am not sure if this place is always like this or we came on a bad night.  There were only 3 tables occupied (counting us).  Food took an unexpectedly long time to arrive.  Two of the 5 orders were wrong and one was not even close to what the picture portrayed.  

Plates were warmer then the food.  Flavors were not there either...Food was very blain...lettuce had the most flavor out of everything."}
{"text":"The word I would use is unremarkable. My husband has coerced me to go to Cuco's three times now and every time has been just ok. Not good, not bad, just...meh. I would never choose to go back on my own that's for sure.
I have had chicken enchiladas, shrimp \"cocktail\" and some burrito. All were mediocre.  My husband gets the burrito cucos and loves it. My 2 year old son loves the chicken enchiladas and refried beans...then again he eats crayons so you might not want to trust his palette lol!
If you are looking for passable Mexican food you'll be happy. If you're looking for more, perhaps you should pass on Cuco's."}
{"text":"Adequate food, below average service. Cinco de Mayo they were busy as expected, although we got a table right away. No waiter/waitress for 30 minutes, though... Not acceptable no matter what the occasion."}
{"text":"My group really, really wanted to love this place, due to its close location to our house. Unfortunately, the whole dinner was nothing but disappointments.

- Only one waitress for the entire dining room. Service was incredibly slow, drinks were not refilled, was attempted to be served someone else's dinner, then had to wait what seemed like forever to get our check. We had planned to get dessert but decided against it since service just took so long for everything. This was only partly the fault of our waitress, the establishment simply needs to hire more waitstaff.

- Sauces on our food tasted tinny like they had come from a can. When there are so many other options for Mexican food in the area, you need to make sure your sauces are good. I don't know if theirs is homemade or not, but it certainly didn't taste like it. My enchilada was super watery due to the sauce and skimpy filling on the inside. Not only that, but the flavor was bland too.

- One person at our table ordered a margarita. After he finally got it, he commented the taste was also bland and unimpressive.

With places like El Jalapeno and select chain restaurants nearby, Cuco's needs to step up its game. Stop cheaping out on service and the food. Until then, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"There must have been a change of ownership as the waiters and waitresses who have served us in the past were no longer there. 

For the most part, the food tasted the same but the portion of meat was about only a quarter of what they used to give. Not a good sign. 

Service went downhill big time. My boyfriend ordered the special of the day but was given something completely different. When we told our waitress this, she did not apologize. After that, she completely ignored us and avoided our table. For us to even get the check we had to ask a different waitress. Bad customer service. We would have been perfectly happy if she had apologized. 

We haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Decent food and drinks, but the service was very poor.  I probably wouldn't go back.

Once we got our drinks and appetizers, we never saw our waiter again. This prevented us from ordering more drinks or getting waters refilled. It took forever to flag someone down to get my group's bill, and it took an hour from when we asked for the bill to pay and get our credit cards back. Some of the people in our group lost patience and just threw cash down on the table because it took SO long to get the bill."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this place is pretty good mexican food as far as Madison goes. I go here because there is no alternative, but their service is good and their food is decent.

I always got their burrito Mexicana which is good, but the downside is their beef is not good.  Their chicken meat is a lot better.  The last time I went I got the Chicken fajita quesadilla and that was much better then their tough dried beef.

This place gets a 3 because of their beef and how quick the food comes out (meaning they are all precooked) otherwise their portions are ridiculously large and their free chips and salsa tastes really good."}
{"text":"We went here early on a Friday night.  There was no one else there when we arrived (it was 4:30 in Waunakee-I didn't expect a crowd).  By the time we were done there was a decent sized crowd.  Staff was friendly and quick.

Warm corn tortilla chips and salsa were served as our order was taken and water was automatically given and refilled during the meal.  

The restaurant is bigger than it seems from the outside, comfortable seating though nothing special as decor.  The rice was good, fajitas sizzling but the enchiladas and chimmy changas were okay.  The kid's menu had the typical chicken/cheeseburger/corn dog favorites with at least a cheese quesadilla thrown in there for a more local dish.

Overall it wasn't the best Mexican food we had, but it also wasn't bad.  The guacamole was really good and fresh, they had a pretty large selection on their menu and the drinks were a lot bigger than we had planned.  A $12 medium sized margarita is about the size of a normal dinner plate.  Worth it, but keep in mind the size."}
{"text":"Food is not very good. Service is awkward. If you go with a group don't plan on getting your food at the same time. Another Mexican restaurant would do well in Waunakee. This place is very subpar."}
