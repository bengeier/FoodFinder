{"text":"The food is good but not for the price point. Portions were small. We had the noodle soup with thin noodles & duck, wonton w/ thin noodles, BBQ pork buns (3 pcs) and shumai (4 pcs).   Both soups were just ok; soup was a little on the bland side and the duck tasted like it was cooked yesterday. Wonton soup was alright.   Overall this local Asian will not be returning to eat here. It wasn't bad, just over priced....$3 for a 12 oz soda and $3 for a can of juice?! Our total for everything was $48.00 not including the tip. Again, portions (everything including drinks) were small. I was still thirsty but wasn't going to buy a bottle of Evian water from there."}
{"text":"Who writes a review about room service food? I do!!!  Well technically it's food from Bao Now that is also the room service option at The Lucky Dragon Hotel. I must say being of Asian descent, it is kind of nice to have a change up on your typical type of room service Americana food. The prices for the food are quite exceptional for room service food and range on average about $9 per item and the portions are pretty good. The boyfriend and I decided to order the loco moco, kimchee fried rice, shrimp tempura, pork adobo, pot stickers, BBQ chicken and Lo Mein. I know it seems like a lot of food but we ordered both for breakfast and lunch.  Loco Moco- I was impressed for room service food that this was a flavorful dish and done surprisingly well.  Kimchee Fried Rice- This was average, a bit on the bland side for me and lacking the authentic kimchee flavor that I was looking for.  Shrimp Tempura-This was average but the dipping sauce was pretty good.  Pork Adobo-This had pretty good seasoning, a bit different from how I make pork adobo and I couldn't really taste the vinegar but definitely a good take on authentic adobo.  Lo Mein- This was a bit dry but did have enough flavor without necessarily needing additional soy sauce.  Pot Stickers- I enjoyed the pot stickers and each dumpling was filled quite well. The shrimp tempura dipping sauce worked well with this dish.  Overall, for room service food this was definitely pretty good food. You can also have this at their restaurant and as mentioned for the price I'd definitely continue to wat at Bao Now. They also have pretty good hot noodle soup and my boyfriend loves their Bao.  The customer service is excellent whether room service or at their restaurant and if you eat at the restaurant be sure to get your locals discount at any of The Lucky Dragons restaurant. Happy Eating!!!"}
{"text":"I love baos. Next time I'll just get them from my favorite Japanese place. Theirs are always good. Bao Now's baos meat was a bit too chewy and not tender. Also, I didn't care much for kimchee in my short rib bao. The portion didn't consist of nice, big chunks either, which I'm used to when I get a bao. I tried their won ton soup based on the cashier's recommendation. It was so bland, even after a added the little sauces they gave you. I added some salt, but it wasn't enough. It included a lot of thin noodles that were kind of hard. Won ton soup usually doesn't have noodles, so I found this strange."}
{"text":"Worth the 15 minute wait. I ordered the Taiwan Style Beef Noodle Soup and Vietnamese iced coffee. There is very limited seating here. I recommend that you have a friend save seats and you take their order. The broth of the soup had good flavor. Not too salty. There is a choice between thick or thin noodles. I chose the thin noodles. The noodles were okay tasting. No flavor. There was three big chunks of beef. The beef was tender and delicious. As for the Vietnamese coffee, it tasted good as expected but I requested less ice and ended up with the regular level of ice."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but it is overpriced, at least the noodle dishes, as expected from being in the Lucky Dragon.  We had both noodle soup dishes and baos. The baos were pretty good and not bad for the price. You get 3 per order. Char siu bao was yummy but came with just two strips of meat. The ginger fried chicken one was really good and I preferred it over the char siu bao. The noodle soup was fine and for a morning meal is good, but once other options open up then this would not be a go-to option for me. I was just starving for food early in the morning and it was one of two open places in my immediate area. It wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular or fantastic about it. It did have generous portions of meat though."}
{"text":"Came in late just for the bao, had the Char siu, and short rib. Both were very tender and seasoned just right.   The char siu was sweet BBQ sauce and the short rib was accompanied with kimchi.  Perfect late night snack.  I just wished they had more  dim sum all day.   Ok I'm a fatty."}
{"text":"Don't bother. The saddest, blandest food I've ever tasted. We weren't offered water even though we dined there, I had to ask for it. Everything came out lukewarm even the noodle soup. The saddest was probably the Jap Chae. It's basically boiled noodles in salt water with 3 pieces of green onion, a piece of fish cake and some boiled mushrooms. Everything was so bland and plain that soy sauce and chili sauce couldn't help.   The waitress was rude A/F. When she came to serve our food all she said was \"how many\", like WTF, how many what? Apparently she was trying to ask how many people we had. When I tried to complain about the food all she had to say was she didn't know, she didn't take the order. I told her the food had no flavor but she didn't care and walked away.   I really don't know how anyone gave his place more than 1 star. If I could give it negative stars it would be - 5 stars.   What we ordered: Wonton noodle soup Short rib and Kim Chee bao Kim Chee fried rice  \"Jap Chae\" in quotes because it really wasn't Jap Chae  It took 30 minutes for this mess to come out. There was only 1 person who ordered ahead of us and 2 \"chefs\" in the kitchen (kitchen is viewable).   If you still decide to come here, too bad you didn't take my advice. I'm a fluffy woman and you can tell I don't miss any meals and definitely know good food and this ain't it!"}
{"text":"Quick service and good dim sum. I'm glad we found this place. It's nothing fancy. We'll be back another time."}
{"text":"I love the fried rice and taro tea here but the service wasn't really good when I was there this afternoon to get my taro tea."}
{"text":"Love this place! You can never go wrong if you want great dim sum. Friendly service, beautiful atmosphere, and delicious food! I recommend eating here & playing here if you haven't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"we ate there twice both time were great we had the Wanton soup with shrimp, Fried vegetable lo mein and Shrimp Pad Thai Noodle"}
{"text":"Located on the 1st floor of the Lucky Dragon casino and pretty close to the parking elevators. I have mixed reviews about this place after my 2nd visit here, but I'm rounding up since they're still new. I came here late around 11pm, and they ran out of about half of the menu items.   Pork belly bao- drenched in grease all around, and the pork belly was more like saut√©ed pieces of bacon with hardly picked vegetables. And who puts mayonnaise in their baos?   Braised beef bao- much better than the pork belly. The beef was tender and sandwiched between a warm bun. But still with the bad picked carrots/daikon and the mayonnaise. We covered it with hoisin and sriracha sauce   Egg tarts-Portuguese style egg tarts, perfectly warm and toasted. My favorite part of this place and I'd come back just for this. It was very expensive for only 2 pieces, but it was bigger than your average egg tart  Hainan chicken rice- should hardly be called this. Very deceiving and disappointing. It's basically boiled chicken sitting on top of ginger flavored rice, topped with a few veggies and the same \"pickled\" veggies. No chili or ginger sauce here, which should be standard for Hainan chicken.   I'd avoid getting the Bao dishes, despite the name of the restaurant. They use the same kitchen as dragons alley, so a lot of the food is similar. This would definitely be a great place for a late night drunken meal."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Need improvement. The menu does not have a good selection. Prices are expensive. Staff is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Fast Chinese food for cheap.   Great tasting food with tons of drinks available.   Grand opening they got slammed but still managed to get food out and keep people fed.  Thanks Bao Now for hooking me and my homies up!"}
{"text":"Horrible first time going and stood there while workers were walking past us not asking us if we need anything or seeing if we need help I was very excited about visiting this restaurant because it also my first time staying at there hotel"}
{"text":"Charsui & teriyaki chicken Bao was very tasty!! -2 because I paid $3 for Thai tea & got a 9.5oz store bought bottle drink."}
{"text":"Amazingly juicy dumplings! Slowest, most confused service in Nevada. All of the seats were taken by those just waiting. Sad for a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Friendly quick service food. I ordered the wontons (highly recommended) and the short rib bao (also very good). Reasonable prices especially for a venue on the strip in a casino!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here around 2 am. There was a group of people ahead of us & a couple other people already eating. We took a look at the menu & decided to order the braised beef baos, the roasted duck noodle soup w/ thick egg noodles, & the beef stew noodle soup also w/ thick egg noodles.   I like that you can watch the cook through the glass so I didn't get too bored as we waited for them to make all of the food for the big group ahead of us. It's a pay at the counter & order your food at the counter type restaurant which I've become a fan of. They also have you pick up your own food at the counter when it's done but the nice lady walked all of our food to our table when it was done.   I was a little nervous to go here because it's still brand new & the reviews are mixed! But I really was craving some bao! So why not try this place called \"Bao Now\"?! The braised beef baos were very good. The insides were perfect but I wish the bao bun was just a liiiiittle bit sweeter! I loved loved LOVED my roasted duck egg noodle soup! The duck was cooked perfectly & was so delicious! The broth was flavorful & the noodles were good. The Chinese broccoli in it added a nice crunch. Yum!   My boyfriend had the beef stew noodle soup & it was good! He added two little cups of hot sauce in it & it tasted quite similar to Pho, we liked it! But the next day, he was throwing up a lot of the food he ate here, all day. & feel like he has the stomach flu. We think it could have been because of something he ate here but are not positive!!!   Anyways.... I'm glad I tried this place out because I loved the food & the service was wonderful. It's a little small w/ few tables & chairs & if it's busy, you may not have a place to sit down. It's not super over-priced either & it's in the new Lucky Dragon Casino so it's a good excuse to see the place!!"}
{"text":"Three star maybe a little much, 2-1/2 would do it.  My wife and I stopped in to try the food as we saw some good reviews.  We were disappointed when we got our orders.  I had the wonton noodle w/shrimp, it had maybe 4 in it. The vegetable in it was long and had a hard time biting through it. It did have a good amount of noodles but the broth was a little bland.  My wife is not big on this type of food so she got the teriyaki chicken, which was missing the teriyaki and it had 3 little pieces about 1 inch x 1 inch on each bun. \"Where's the chicken\".  We also ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings which had no salt or pepper anywhere to be tasted.  All in all we were not happy with the food or the cost, $30.88. Plus 2.50 each for a small bottle of coke.  If anyone would like a good bowl or soup go to where I go and get their \"war wonton soup w/noodles\" at Great Wall on West Charleston. There you get shrimp, chicken, beef, pork, vegetables and noodles for around 9 bucks. Don't forget to try the egg rolls there too."}
{"text":"This place was pretty delicious. We got the BBQ pork which was excellent and the Taiwanese noodle soup wich was okay it had good portion of veggies and very soft brisket the only thing I thought was the broth could be a little more flavorful. Overall we enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere is very relaxed considering its inside a casino."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre and the prices are not worth it. I'd encourage you to save your money so you can uber to Chinatown and get better quality food probably for less. We tried their roasted duck bao... and even though you get 3... they're pretty tasteless. I can drizzle hoisin sauce on a pair of boots and you won't be able to tell the difference. Save yourself some time and don't go here for the food, unless you're looking to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Convenient, decent quick service. Designed to be taken to go with limited seats and all orders wrapped for carryout.   Had the wonton noodle soup with thin noodles and a side of bbq pork buns.   The broth was rather bland on it's own but they give you sides of chili oil and soy sauce that helps. I also asked for chili sauce which also helped.   The pork buns were freshly made, standard flavour.   Price point is pretty good. I used the locals dining credit offer so my meal was free but normally what I ordered would've been $19.21 with tax. Good amount of food for the price.   Overall pretty good but not as good as my others in to"}
{"text":"I ordered this for delivery and wow! The short rib bao with Kim Chee was awesome! The teriyaki chicken bao was ok, but that cold noodle salad with peanut sauce - amazing!  They use fresh vegetables for garnish and the bao dough is springy and soft!  I'm going to order again!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I needed assistance with the menu due to it being so authentic but the cashier was great at explaining the menu and I was very happy with my choices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dim sum items are Shui Mai and saw they had it here. I was curious and gave this a try. I ordered BBQ Pork Bun and Shui Mai.  (Shui Mai $5.88 ) was really good! It was not dry and generous on the shrimp. Way better compare to other places I've had.   (BBQ Pork Bun) this is okay and pretty basic.  I can go without ordering this."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Hong Kong & the foods here are definitely authentic!  I don't get to go back to Hong Kong often & this place help cure my homesickness.  I also love that this place opens 24/7 (not great for my diet though...).  I've tried the roasted duck, bbq pork, & beef stew and they're all very good.   My fav is hands down the roasted duck.  My one suggestion would be to add authentic Hong Kong style drinks such as lemon ice tea & milk tea.  This place is my new go-to in vegas!"}
{"text":"Seriously? 5 smallest XiaoLongBao l have ever seen, took me two minutes to eat everything, and I ordered \"for here\" she even asked me if I wanted plates, but then she brought me two boxes Iike I can eat them on my way out...and I singed 15% tip for her at the pay up front? I was tripping I guess."}
{"text":"I had the Chinese BBQ Pork to go. It come with your choice of white or brown rice and Chinese veggies. The pork was very lean and moist. VERY Tasty!! I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Just the thing we were looking for at 3:30 am, since our flight had been mega-delayed and I was starving. Expectations were super low, considering the hour and the low number of Yelp reviews, but I was willing to give it a try.  Bao Now is actually quite decent for a brand new resto (this is review #5) in a brand new hotel/casino in Las Vegas. The casino floor was pretty empty and the area is small compared to other casinos.   The cashier was friendly, although her explanation of the noodle soups got pretty confusing. When we asked for Beef Noodle Soup (expecting the typical Taiwanese style dish), she mentioned they ran out of beef balls, and would it be okay to replace them with fish balls? We definitely didn't want that. She recommended maybe doing a Pho style soup but with the egg noodles. We were even more perplexed why a Chinese resto was doing pho. That didn't sound good either.   It turns out we made good choices that night. We'd already had the **Pork Belly Bao** in mind and it was excellent. Their take on the bao is very interesting with a flavorful bun and really good pork belly to accompany it. Since I really wanted a soup, we finally settled on the **Roast Duck Noodle Soup**. It was extremely hearty and rich in flavor, and really hit the spot.  Prices are pretty reasonable considering this is in a Las Vegas hotel/casino. It was under $20 for our 2 dishes. Don't expect actual Chinatown street food prices, people. That just doesn't make any sense.   3.5 STARS rounding up since the food was good, hot, and came out fast. It's borderlining to a round-down due to confusion on the concept, but I'm adding in a little good faith they'll step up their game.  TIP: Odd hours seem to be the perfect time to visit. Hardly any wait at all!  TIP 2: Prepare to be a little confused when ordering.  DATE TIP: Hope your date doesn't mind eating super late and in a quiet setting."}
{"text":"This beef noodle soup is very bland with basic noodles and slivers of beef that aren't very flavorful. Possibly a dash of sauce with water for soup. Disappointed considering it took 15 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"This place was great!  We ate here 3 times and had about 7 items on the menu.  Everything was fantastic!  The counter and seating area don't look like much, but take a look at the kitchen.  It's large and has plenty of equipment.  Me and my picky panda girlfriend were very happy with the food.  Highly recommended for something quick and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Ordered on uber eats. Care almost 2 hours late and they were rude.  The spam was brown & tasted crusty  Very disappointed. Never ordering again."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Vegas. I almost dont want to write this because i dont want the secret to come out! Open 24 hrs , the food is delicious and super cheap.  I had the pork belly bao, and the bbq pork bao. It was delicious and keep in mind one order is actually 3 bao sandwiches!   I also got the beef shank noodle soup which was heaven. I'm not the terminator but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for quick, high quality dim sum, noodles and boba on the go. They also have really great Vietnamese tea and croissant breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been to Bao Now twice. I think if I ever have a strong craving for Chicken Congee, this would be a place I would go to. $4.50 for a very nice bowl of warm sobering congee (dry chicken tho). BUT THAT IS IT.  The first time I came here, I was lured that they served boba special. But never got boba because it wasn't....normal milk tea. Their options where pre-flavored, like mango or strawberry milk teas.   It's located in the Lucky Dragon Casino, which is very tailored to Chinese gamblers. Chinese (Cantonese/Mandarin) pop music plays in the background. It's generally a very small casino in relation to the others in Vegas. (Kinda next to Stratosphere) Small note: they can bring you fruit while you gamble (instead of cocktails)  The main reason this place is 3 stars, in my opinion, is it's seriously not very good. I guess after trying a few casino casual dining experiences, I should really lower my expectations that these establishments are definitely casino first, restaurant dead last. Bao Now promotes a stereotype by trying to add other popular Asian cuisines in their menu which doesn't work. There's pad Thai, Kim chi Fried Rice, Pancit all in the same menu --definitely trying to be a Jack of all trade, and master of none.  Here's a few notes I jotted down:   My friends had the kimchi fried rice, which he thought was gross (flavorless). The wait was also very long (over 15 minutes)  The Spicy Korean Beef Noodle Soup is redeemable, if you didn't consider it Korean and just as a bowl of soup with lots of vegetables/noodles.   Do not get the Spam Masubi. Ono Hawaiian just blows this place out of the water, and then spears it.  Just get the congee. It's $2.50, if you like it plain.  The staff...try. You can tell there's one or two staff that try to make this place work. Matthew (December 2017) looks like he knows what he is doing. But the 'supervisors' (Asian guys in suits) look like they freshly graduated from an MBA program in hospitality with no work experience. They don't really know how to use the cash register or don't know where the items are in the POS. In addition, I overheard a number of customers saying their Room Credits weren't applying correctly. I don't know what that's all about, but if there's smoke, there's definitely fire. Basically, eat here if you crave congee or are staying at the Lucky Dragon.  It is open 24 Hours, but so is Lee's Sandwiches if you don't mind the drive."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Stopped by here at 2 am with a few friends. We all shared the different baos. My favorite is probably short rib. The potstickers are also super good. Also a great spot to stop and grab a boba!"}
{"text":"This place tastes surprisingly authentic! I was pleasantly surprised. I had the roast duck noodle soup, egg tarts, and a Vietnamese iced coffee. The roast duck noodle soup was delicious. The portions of duck was more than I expected and had excellent flavor, the veggies were very fresh and cooked perfectly, I would have liked just a tad bit more noodles since there was so much duck. It taste like something I would have been able to get back home in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of course the price would be much less, but this is Vegas, so I wouldn't call it unreasonable. This dish was $13.88.   The egg tarts were not great, but I've had worse. I would skip the egg tarts. The custard was not smooth and creamy. A little on the grainy side. Definitely not like the famous Golden Gate Bakery in SF Chinatown. I guess it can do in a pinch if you really wanted some. The price of these were ridiculous though. $6.88 for two!!! Should be more like $4.99 or $5.99 at the very most. Or $6.88 for three would be decent for Vegas at a place like this.   The Vietnamese iced coffee was probably the best deal. Nice size, taste great, and was only $3.88!  I'd come back, especially since they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a decent price.  You can order room service if you're staying at Lucky Dragon, but I just walked down.  I liked the vegetable noodles.  Not a ton of veggie/Vegan options, but I was starving, so I wasn't too picky.  Only downside is really, $8 for a bottle of water?  Maybe that's typical for Vegas, but all I could think of was, \"I can get a case of water at Costco, for about 2.99.\""}
