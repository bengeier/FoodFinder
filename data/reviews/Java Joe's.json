{"text":"Fresh and delicious salad at a good price. Everything is crisp, very crisp and full of flavour.  A delicious and healthy lunch for under $10.  Also, the people there are very friendly.  Really good coffee too.  A hidden gem in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff personnel  are friendly and quick, even when they have a lot of people - they will get your order done right and fast. Great place to go to if you're in a rush, or if you'd like to sit down. They have a great selection of flavoured coffee - and the flavours change from time to time so you don't get bored. A little pricier than McDonald's / Tim Hortons but not as pricey as Starbucks. Nice middle ground price wise."}
{"text":"Frequently stop in here when killing time near the airport. I've only had the breakfast sandwich (hard to mess up eggs on a bagel) which is good and the coffee is excellent with 6-7 selections of mild, bold and flavors. 2.89 for coffee and a muffin (not as cheap as some places but the muffins are fairly large).  It's bright clean, with ample seating and usually very quiet. Best of all for killing time is the free wireless and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was supposed to meet some people here for work, but arrived from the airport half an hour before the place opened. The owner happened to be around, and he let me in and gave me free coffee (and wifi).   The place is decent in general -- 5 stars for the hospitality."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in here since I've been working about half a block away for 6 months.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's great once you get in.  I had to explain what a London Fog was to the barista and she ended up making me a fantastic drink.  They have some breakfast options which I didn't explore but the lunch menu looked pretty good.  They have a few booths and tables to sit at, but I would guess during the lunch rush you would be hard pressed to find an empty table.  They cater too!"}
{"text":"Visited Java Joe's in Richmond Hill today for lunch.  I loved the atmosphere and the gourmet sandwiches.  I tried the Philly Cheese steak on a pita...wow.  They brought it to my table all warm and toasted.  Service was fantastic...from the person who took my order to the person who delivered the food."}
{"text":"This was ok +. They have a choice of sandwiches, a few warm plates, salads and cookies. Not a tremendous choice, but it is clean, fast and very friendly. If you want to eat as a group, skip it though, you can't really sit more than 4 people at one table.  I had a panini and the bread was not great and there was too much of it. I really wish i had a salad, those looked really really good."}
{"text":"First time at a Java Joes and the serving staff are really nice!  I got a latte and enjoyed every bit of it.  This location even serves Korean dishes! I didn't get a chance to try but will do so on my next visit.  Not too large a location so i can see it get busy (I went Sunday morning so it was bad at all).  Great place!"}
{"text":"There are few things that this location of Java Joe's has to its advantages:  - not too many cafes in the area that served coffees and sandwiches (you probably can count by 10 fingers) - Wifi Access - Nice, clean modern design - Great, friendly staffs - Reasonable priced with good coffee selections  The cappuncino I ordered is $3.10. The nice lady ask me if I want to make it with 2% or Skim Milk. Do I have I am on a diet written on my face? Anyway, skim milk sounded good.  The funny thing is they are serving all the drinks in paper cup regardless if you are staying in or not. Not only it is not environmental friendly, I cannot drink from paper cup! I need my big big mug! I have to specially request that and she went huh?!  The coffee is ok, not the best I have... but I don't understand why the milk froth is so thick and heavy......  The opening hours are geared towards the working crowds, close at 5 pm on weekdays and closed all weekends.  The plastic see through chair can be a hazard for ladies in mini skirt!"}
{"text":"Con panna and a berry muffin make my day. Comfortable environment and nice coffee"}
