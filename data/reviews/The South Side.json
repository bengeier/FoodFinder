{"text":"Nice patio. The food was pretty good. Our waiter was very attentive and did a great job but he seemed stressed the entire time so others may misread him as rude. Overall good, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great.   The crab cake benedict plate was completely underwhelming. Awful plate presentation and the spinach was cold.   My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and it was good, not the best I've had.  The bloody marys are good."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  My favorite restaurant in town to go with friends! Best veggie burger in town!  You can tell its homemade. Great place in the summer time with a beer on the patio!"}
{"text":"If I didn't have a favorite drink or dish at this place, I would probably hate it.  It's not very big, generally a wait to sit, and so-so wait staff.  Once in a blue moon, we have a great waitress, but most of the time, it just really doesn't even seem like anyone cares.  However, once I have a Georgia Gem (or 2) I really don't care about the service.    I've had their Mac and Cheese (eh), but I must say their Chicken and Waffles is oh so good.  Plus, I LOVE the hot sauce on the side.  Please don't ever take the hot sauce away.  I  was still working on the appetizer when our entrees came, and the waitress snatched the hot sauce up, and I asked for it back, and she said, \"Oh, I never see anyone using it.\"  ME.  I USE IT.    Also, I'm not a salad girl.  However, their Duck and Goat Cheese salad is delicious.  Very good combo of the two, plus onions, corn, greens, and a balsamic dressing.  My boyfriend and I usually get dessert to go - either the Chocolate Suicide cake or whatever their cheesecake is.  Nothing to write home about, but satisfying for dessert.    I find my patience is always tested here.  If you don't know what to order, you can walk out of here hating this place.  But once you find the combination of things you like, the positives seem to outweigh the negatives."}
{"text":"Place was packed on a Saturday afternoon, usually a good sign... Unfortunately there is not much to absorb the sound and it was so loud I couldn't hear my boyfriend sitting next to me.   There was no host around, so we sat at the bar.  My seat was right next to the service bar. I watched the bartender hold pizza in her mouth as she popped caps off of beer bottles....Egh. She continued eating her pizza while ringing in orders...weird.  She held her pizza as she was taking orders...unprofessional.  Enough about the stupid pizza, on to the food we ate! I ordered the Ahi Tuna burger and my boyfriend ordered the Mussels and the mustard chicken wings.  I cannot speak for him, but my burger was ok. Nothing I would order again.  It was dry and I was disappointed because it was \"ahi\" tuna! Don't overcook \"ahi\"!!!!!!! Thankfully the burger came with pickled slaw and that helped the burger's flavor profile. Just a shame, because using a quality tuna should speak for itself in flavor.  Don't really care to go back, but the patio looked nice and I'm a sucker for patios!  I'll return when it's nicer outside and explore their cocktails in the sun!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?!?!? Used to love this place, been here a million times. Times are changing I guess. Bartenders screaming at the top of their lungs over the blaring music....screming about their personal lives and swearing like old men (they were girls). Took forever to get a drink. Food not even slightly what it used to be - It was soggy sludge. Things that were supposed to be hot were cold and vice versa. Our empty glasses sat in front of us for way too long. Poor service, the food just sucked, and the temperature was not under control in there - very windy and cold with blasting ceiling fans and air conditioner vents (it's not warm outside). Bye bye. I think im done here. Pretty sad to watch a once awesome place go to crap. I'm really disappointed."}
{"text":"We visited here twice - once on a Sunday for brunch - which was fantastic!  We then stopped by for lunch on a Saturday - poor service and the selection and taste of food was OK!  Try the chorizo gravy on biscuits for brunch - delicious!  The brunch cocktails are also very good!  We would return for Sunday brunch only!"}
{"text":"I'm still trying to figure out what people like about this place. It's a decent bar to drink at but the food is awful. I wanted to like it because I kept hearing good things so I gave it three tries and it got progressively worse. The first time I had the mussels with chorizo which were alright, not good but not terrible. We tried it again a few months later and although the food was bad the terrible service trumped the below average food. Our waiter was terrible! After waiting over 20 minutes for him so we could order a drink I finally went up to the bar. When he noticed this he went to the table and yelled at my girlfriend and her brother because he wanted the tip. After telling myself I would never go back I was persuaded to go for their \"amazing\" brunch. It was by far the worst meal I had there. I ordered their \"famous\" chicken and waffles. Wow, they were bad. The waffles were deep fried along with the chicken. The food was so greasy I couldn't finish it. I would NEVER go back there."}
{"text":"Southside is one of those great places you can go to for a casual meal or a fun night out. If I lived closer there is no doubt in my mind that I would be a regular.  If you plan on going to The South Side for food, here is a tip: Be adventurous. They have a few things on their menu that are unique and taste very good. The duck pizza is one of those menu items that I love to come back to every once in a while. They also have seasonal dishes and last week I tried the pumpkin ravioli with brown sugar sauce. That was totally off the heazy. For sheezy.  Bar hopping or stopping in to drink all night with friends is also an excellent choice. They typically have a dj spinning good music and the variety of people is nice. If the weather is pleasant, the outside patio is a great way to enjoy the fall air with a cold Christmas Ale.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  This past weekend I had my birthday brunch there with 20 people.  The service and food was amazing!!!  Several of my friends were here for the first time and they really enjoyed the atmosphere!  I highly recommend this place for any time of the day!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. I came here at 6PM on a Friday, which is quite early for Tremont goers. The restaurant had a couple people, with no hostess to be found. After standing and waiting to be seated for several minutes, we decided to seat ourselves- at which point a woman that was standing and talking to a man at the bar  for the past 5 minutes came over and introduced herself as the hostess.  Really? I understand I'm in Tremont, the hipster too-cool capital of Cleveland, but that was unacceptable.  Finally at a table, we ordered. I got a chicken sandwich and my partner got the Tremont burger. My sandwich was mediocre and at one point whilst eating, I said I have had similar quality at Wendy's. Chips were soggy and left a grease film in my mouth. Partner's Tremont burger was.. odd. Tomato jam lended a strange acidic flavor that overpowered everything else. Ditto for onion rings- soggy grease film.   $30 for a Wendy's quality chicken sandwich and a greasy burger? Hell no. As we left, my partner said \"I wish I would've spent calories on B Spot instead.\" Agreed!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and atmosphere. Service was on poinour bartender Courtney was efficient, knowledgeable, and funny as hell. Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"We went on a week night for dinner. It took over an hour to get our food. Mind you we only ordered fish. For the price of the meals basically 20, a plate we only received half a order of fish. Seemed to be understaffed for the size of the crowd. Won't be going back ever. There are a ton of other restaurants in that neighborhood for us to try. If you don't mind waiting a hour to eat then go right ahead.  The food was ok to bad it took so long."}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Looking for chicken and waffles and when I googled that, this restaurant came up. Well, I think we went to the wrong place because this place was AWFUL!!! Waited 10 minutes to be served.  Meanwhile, we can hear the wait staff talking rather loudly and one of the girls is cursing like a sailor!!  Finally, we order iced tea, it was colored water that tasted like coffee. Still excited to eat, we order the chicken and waffles.  We get our food and it looks promising, despite the potty mouth waitress in the back still yammering, we dig in!  The waffle was ice cold!  Not just cooled down cold, like out of the refrigerator cold in the center!  The chicken wasn't bad but it wasn't good enough to forgive the frozen waffle.  So we attempt to flag down a server. I finally flag down a server for a fresh waffle and more water.  The new waffle arrives and is over cooked!! The water never came.  My sister started making slurping sounds and the waitress refilled the coffee/tea!  Needless to say, I have no desire to return and I was very disappointed.  The best chicken and waffles I ever had were in Bluffton, SC and if I do find somewhere in Ohio, I know it won't be at The South Side!!!! Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"DON'T BOTHER.   I practically live next door to South Side and would give the food a \"C\" and service a \"D\" (generous).  The quality of the food here is really hit or miss.  The house salad, burgers, and seared tuna are great, but the soups are incredibly salty and the calamari is so wrong it should be illegal.  Service is a different story.  The girls here have obvious attitude problems and might possibly be some of the worst servers I've ever experienced in Cleveland.  One night we waited almost 20 minutes to pay for our bill while our server flirted and did shots with some guy at the other end of the bar.  i felt like we could have walked out and nobody would have noticed.  As a Tremont resident, i would recommend pretty much every other restaurant/bar in the area over South Side."}
{"text":"I started writing a detailed description of the disastrous dinner my boyfriend and I had here with confusingly poor service (had probably 3 different servers and they all forgot to put our food in, being the main point), but all the details of who did (and didn't do) what don't really matter to someone on Yelp just trying to find a good place to eat. Here's what you need to know:   Cool place, good location, good vibes, enjoyed ourselves despite bad service resulting in our dinner order never getting put in and having to wait over 45 minutes. The manager came out and personally apologized and comped our meal, which obviously we really appreciated. Food we were divided on: fried calamari appetizer was fantastic, and my boyfriend nearly fainted when he tried his Chicken & Waffles it was so good, and believe me this guy is hard to impress. My turkey cuban was nothing to write home about and the side salad it came with was wilty and bland, but I feel bad complaining too much about a comped meal....still, just want people to know.  Don't know what to say about this place - obviously their famed dishes live up to the hype, maybe try to avoid going during busy hours when stuff like this is likely to happen. I'm glad we gave the South Side a try, even with all the trouble we had."}
{"text":"This place has a creative menu, but the kitchen doesn't seem super clean.  The bar staff is friendly and the decor is slightly appealing. A good neighborhood spot"}
{"text":"Snuck in for lunch after seeing the long line for Sokolowski's.  We sat at a bar table and received reasonably decent service for a busy place.  We shared a chicken enchilada app, which was OK... could have been hotter (temperature, not spice), but was still definitely a step up from most bar apps.  The Mrs had the spinach/ goat salad and I had the chicken Caesar... holy huge salads!  The spinach goat was good (though not something I would order) and Caesar was perfect... fresh semi-soft croutons, lightly dressed, and wonderfully tender chicken.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"used to love this place but just went for lunch and not a fan of the new menu~chix and waffles was not as good as it use to be and the kitchen seemed to be lacking"}
{"text":"First i have to say Ive been to southside a handful of times because I live in the neighborhood and im giving it a two because ive had some good food here. The hostess staff are rude and they asked me everytime ive been to south side  \"If I think I could be finished with my meal within a period of time \"because they have a party. Usually the time frame is 45 mins to a 1 they give me.  Thats rude and makes the customers feel rushed. Food takes forever is the morning or brunch so be prepared if you have more than one other person to wait and have your food some what cold."}
{"text":"South Side has really really good food. It's not too daring, but different - and just tasty. My favorites:  Chicken and Waffles: It may sound weird, but this southern classic is done perfectly with syrup and siracha hot sauce. Last time I went, I got the swordfish, which was really good too, but I secretly wanted my friend's chicken and waffles.   Open Faced Grilled Cheese (Brunch menu only): With over-easy eggs and hollandaise, this thing is right up there with something you'd get at Melt. Worth the calories.  The service is ok. I find it very annoying that they won't split checks for large parties, but they will tack on the 18% mandatory gratuity. That tip is supposed to be there specifically because large parties are more complicated."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this establishment, it had a nice rustic feelin the inside and they have a long bar, but it is a bit rather tight inside. Me and my roommate went for brunch on Sunday, and so was the rest of tremont so it was a bit of a wait but we didn't mind, the staff were nice and kept us engaged. We sat outside in the patio and it was really nice. I had the breakfast burrito which was amazingly delicious!"}
{"text":"I visited this place and really I dig it....great hang out with live dj.....food great as well as drinks....I will definitely try it out when the weather breaks I bet that would be awesome.....looking for a place to hang out give this a try."}
{"text":"We went here for the Chicken and Waffles. It was my first time having the dish, and while I didn't exactly know what to expect, I definitely didn't think it'd be so fancy. I think that historically, the dish was typically made from scraps as cheap comfort food, but The South Side puts their own spin on it. At The South Side, they serve a Belgian waffle that is accompanied by a meaty piece of fried white chicken and topped off with a generous slab of cinnamon laced butter. The maple syrup isn't too sweet, in fact, we were told that it's made with agave for a lighter taste. It also comes with a side of sriracha for those that like their food with a little spice. The combination of the cinnamon buttered waffle, greasy chicken, maple syrup and sriracha may sound unusual, but one bite stimulated so many different taste buds that it actually created a heavenly mix of salty, sweet, and spicy. How all those flavors can come together to be so delicious still boggles my mind.  While this review was mostly for the chicken and waffles, I will briefly mention that the other dishes ordered were prepared just as well with quality ingredients for an average of $15(+) a person. Portion sizes are good, and with that being said, the chicken and waffles is listed as a small dish for $9.50 is actually quite filling."}
{"text":"I really like this place, they have a nice outside patio to enjoy when the weather is nice.  Good bar food, I have had a burger and their steak sandwich. Both I would order again. My one complaint is the service can sometimes be a little slow."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot more. The mac and cheese with crispy chicken was my business!!! But the last time I came here, the macaroni wasn't their usual pasta but a penne which is far inferior to the pasta they were using before. I don't know if it's because they just ran out or they have changed things, but change it back plz! I just felt like the whole dish had less gusto than before :( Other than that, the burgers are also decent, but nothing to write home about. The duck pizza is also pretty good.  Other than that, this place is still a fun place to hang out. Their chicken and waffles is decent, and their beer selection is actually great! They have live bands sometimes. Tip: The parking lot across the street is for the restaurant (a rare find in the area).  This place is also great for parties as the large tables in the second room can be put together if you call in advance!  There's a great patio for the summertime!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week.  I have heard alot about it so finally gave it a shot.  Wonderful place!  Great atmosphere and fresh food.  Try it! Will go back."}
{"text":"I really like the Southside but yesterday (7/24/11), you were REALLY dirty! Nothing had been cleaned, food all over the carpet floor and tables were a mess when we walked in. Could have used a good cleaning. Food was good though.......as usual!"}
{"text":"Ok, so if you're talking about going to South Side, prepare to have awful service. That's just the way it is. The last two times that I went here, I've had (quite possibly) the worst dining experiences of my life.   1 - Went to brunch with a group of friends. They told us that the wait would be about a half hour so we decided that we could just grab some drinks at the bar and wait for our table. The servers seemed really agitated that we were \"in the way,\" but it's not like they have any sort of waiting area. After about an hour, we saw a table open up, the perfect size for our group. We ask the hostess if it's ours. She says no. It's for a party in 2 hours. She said that we could have the table if we would be dining for less than 2 hours. We ask her how long the food will take, she says 15 minutes and I know that's a lie. Food doesn't come out out of the kitchen that fast here. We decline so that we don't get kicked out of our table while we're eating. We keep waiting, it's been almost 2 hours. We decided that we didn't want to give them our money and left.   2 - Brunch with a friend. 2 people, no problem, right? Problems. This time, the hostess was super friendly and let us know what was happening with our table at all times before we got seated, which was a nice surprise from our last encounter here. Our server takes our drink order, delivers drinks, takes our food order, and that's all she wrote. No refills, we had to walk up to the bar ourselves to get refills for coffee and water. She didn't even bring out or food, or check on us, we didn't see her once after we placed our food orders. We had to ask the hostess to bring us our check and ring it for us since our server was probably too busy helping a big table of douche bags.   I will never eat here again. Aside from the horrible service, the food is almost as bad. It's not worth being treated miserably for mediocre, over-priced food."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick dinner at 7:30 on a Wednesday night. At first it was difficult to find the building, but eventually we figured it out thanks to google maps. We started out with the calamari which was fantastic. It is not your average calamari from an italian restaurant. It's lightly sauced and garnished with jullienned peppers. For my entree I got the mac n cheese with crispy chicken and a side of twice baked truffle potatoes. The mac and cheese was wonderful and so filling. The twiced baked potatoes were dry and bland with a over bearing taste of truffle, I would not get that side again. Overall we had a pleasant experience, I took away one star for service and price-to-quality ratio."}
{"text":"Had the lobster bisque. Tasted fine. Got home. Puked up all my food. :("}
{"text":"The grouper sandwich was amazing! I wanted a little kick and the person serving us brought me: siracha, the house hot sauce, and spicy Caesar. Couldn't have asked for better service or better food!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people love the Chicken and Waffles at the South Side, but I live for the ORIGINAL BLACKENED GROUPER and the Steak Sandwich. Each time we've went there on a Saturday night it has always been packed and the wait time for a seat is about 45 mins to 1 hr, but we usually find a spot at the bar and are served very quickly. On one occasion we had to send the food back because the waitress made a mistake, but they were so kind to give us the right meal and remove it off the bill. Definitely a place to go on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday for brunch. First time eating there and I wasn't impressed. First off service sucked! We waited at least 10 min before we were greeted and did not even have menus to look at! Every drink we ordered took ten plus min to receive. I had the shrimp cocktail Bloody Mary. Came with two delicious shrimp! The actual Bloody Mary was very salty though. Next bloody I ordered was the dogfishead Mary which is supposed to come with a soft pretzel but instead I got a pretzel rod?? Anyways it was horrible and I sent it back. I wanted to try it because that is one of my favorite IPAs but I guess it shouldn't be mixed with tomato juice in my opinion. Cucumber Mary was refreshing. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and I wasn't a fan. Chicken was cooked good but flavorless. Waffle is deed fried and drenched in syrup! Kinda gross! I must say I think the patio is cool and it's a neat lookin place, but they are way under staffed and that turned me off. I don't think I'll be back :( Wanted to love this place...."}
{"text":"Went here on St. Patrick's Day but I have been here 2 or 3 times before.  In retrospect, we should have just stayed here because so many other bars were obnoxiously packed.  I had corned beef and hash (always on the brunch menu, not just for St. Patrick's).  It was just ok.  They used cubed corned beef, so I don't know if that means they got it from a can or just cut it off of the brisket they were using for the sandwiches and other dishes.  The eggs on top were fine.  I ordered a side of sourdough toast because I LOVE sourdough, but it was barely sour.  It was really just a nice piece of white bread.  My bf liked his omelet and our server was very attentive, so no problems there.  What I dislike the most about South Side is their climate control.  The two front doors are so close together that they do no good.  It just means that both doors are held open constantly for people coming and going.  Unless you sit in the very back of the bar, you are going to get blasted with freezing air every few minutes.  To compensate, the heat is turned up, so if no one comes in or out for 10 minutes you start sweating.  Just install one door with a heat curtain.  Problem solved."}
{"text":"I most not have been trendy enough to get service here. Was sat out on the patio by the hostess. So we had menus to look at. After 15 minutes of no waitress acknowledging our existence even though they had gone right by our table many times we went back to the hostess and asked if we could maybe get some service. Her response was we are doing the best we can. So after five more minutes of waiting and continuing to see waitresses go by we left. Unbelievable. Another table got sat right after us and when we left they still had no service. Call me crazy but I don't think that's proper service. Will never attempt to go back again."}
{"text":"I had the fried bologna sandwich with the side salad with cucumber wasabi dressing and it was top notch. I've had a bunch of their food including at least 5 specials, the blackened grouper sandwich, turkey Cuban, and the chicken and waffles. The food and service is always top notch and the only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because I reserve that to fine dining experiences (though there are no 5s in Cleveland).   Great local bar and restaurant! I highly recommend it and the bar staff is worth a quick beer at minimum."}
{"text":"Sherman, the owner, must use a casting couch to choose staff, cuz they're all hot. Dress for tips. Pretend they're \"into\" you. Ignore you. You know, like the other chicks at the bar!   Then, you get fed unremarkably bland dog chew. Try a soup - dare ya. Glue-like paste mixed with just enough water to keep the spoon from standing on end. Acoustics for music are awful, they've done nothing to fix that since opening, your ears will be in pain if a band's playing. Such a great space, they put a ton of money into turning the old Hi and Dry into a showpiece of mediocrity overdosed on cliche.   Oh...and the crowd. If you like the Treehouse Douchebag Circuit, you'll LOVE Southside. Treehouse fuckfaces dress up for this place! Buzzcut closet case meatheads yelling their latest Brook Park softball heroics at all comers. Sherman tore down a historic house next door to make room for...nothing. Thanks Sherm! There's some chick's elementary school finger smears on the walls very demonstratively labeled as \"local art\".  It really needs to just go out of business and re-open under new management, but Cleveland loves its DoucheChachAssSctratchin swill palaces, so this will likely remain....  .....The Crown Jewel of Tremont Poserdom."}
{"text":"South Side Café (SSC) is a brick building nestled in a neighborhood of old two story homes. You wouldn't expect to find it in this residential neighborhood, but if you do, you won't be disappointed that you did. I stopped in on a Sunday, after their weekly brunch was finished, so I could sample their every day menu.   I was greeted by Jaclyn, the manager of SSC, who chatted me up for a few minutes about my trip. She was enthusiastic and welcoming, and I immediately got good vibes about the place. The entrance leads into a noisy bar area with high top tables along side, but there is also a dining area and really nice, open outdoor patio. Mrs. MVF and I were seated in the outdoor area, but under the open air roof in case of inclement weather.   Our waitress, Rebecca, came right over and took our drink order while we talked with Jaclyn about the menu. We decided on an array of food to sample, and were left to enjoy the refreshingly cool Cleveland weather.   Our first course was Chorizo & Parmesan Stuffed Banana Peppers with plum red tomato sauce and citrus aioli for me, Fried Mozzarella Moons in a pommodoro sauce, and a cup of Lobster Bisque for the Mrs. I cannot emphasize enough how good the presentation was! We were expecting tossed together bar food, and were completely surprised with what was put in front of us. That being said, I am thankful that I do not live in the Cleveland area. I would seriously have an expanding waistline, as I would be eating the Banana Peppers every single day for the rest of my life. An explosion of flavors, slightly spicy, the perfect amount of kick. The mozzarella moon was crunchy and delicious, but I think it would be better suited in a vodka sauce over the pommodoro. The Lobster Bisque was hands down the best that I have ever tasted. Full of lobster chunks, with a thick savory consistency, this bisque was creamy, rich and left me waiting another spoonful.   For lunch, we ordered a few meals that SSC chef Ryn Celebucci was nice enough to \"half\" for us so we wouldn't be wasteful. I ordered the Diver Scallops in a sweet thai chili sauce, with blended jasmine rice and julienne vegetables. I also ordered the Asiago Chicken sandwich, a cheese crusted chicken breast with pickled onion, basil pesto, red leaf and tomato. Mrs NVF ordered a Grilled Cheese on sourdough, made with cheddar, swiss and provolone, topped with a slice of tomato. She also had a side of mac & cheese, which is tossed with white cheddar, smoked gouda, and boursin cheese.   Where do I even start?? Seriously. My diver scallops were perfectly seared, and the thai sauce had a wonderful sweet & tangy mix. The jasmine rice had a killer \"nutty\" taste to it, that left me wishing I didn't ask for a \"half\" portion. I tore through that plate so fast, I'm surprised my taste buds had an opportunity to register! Moving on to my asiago chicken sandwich, here is another choice that I could eat every single day and not ever get bored. The basil pesto and the cheese crusted chicken are such a perfect marriage of foods, that I insisted Mrs NVF take a bite. She completely fought me on it, as she always does (something about how everything I make her sample is always something \"nasty\"), but in the end, I was the victor because she was in love at first bite!! Score one for Nash!   I, shockingly, was offered a bite of Mrs NVF's lunch, and I'm thankful that she was nice enough to share. While I felt that the grilled cheese could have benefited from either more cheddar or possibly some garlic butter (it was missing \"something\", but good nonetheless), her mac & cheese was OFF THE HOOK! Wow! I'm a self proclaimed \"cheese snob\", and I'm pretty picky about my mac, but this was simply cheese heaven. Mrs NVF took a couple bites, and asked that the remainder be boxed. You can imagine the shock on my face when she announced that she was going to give this cheese-splosion to TANK! Don't get me wrong, I love my dog, and I am always up for sharing with him. But there are some things that are so good I could literally lick the plate after eating, and this mac & cheese falls into that category.   While we were digesting our scrumptious fare, Chef Ryn came out to meet us. He came bearing gifts! A delectable Smores Crème Brulee! I'm not a dessert guy. And I certainly don't enjoy when something smooth has \"crunchy bits\" in it. But this dessert rocked my world. A chocolate crème brulee, with a graham cracker crust, topped with a caramelized marshmellow.. Can you say mouthwatering? One spoonful into this dessert and I am a changed man. Between this and the banana peppers, I seriously am already planning my next trip to Ohio!   Chef Ryn was a delight to talk to. He informed me that all of the ingredients in the kitchen come from local farmers, with the cheeses for the mac coming from the Amish. He is a strong believer in \"fresh is best\", and runs a very efficient kitchen. (We watched tables around us get seated, and their food came out fast and on point!)"}
{"text":"i ordered the chicken and waffles listed under the small plates on section of the menu. All I can say is that it was to die for!!! I'm actually heading back in 2 weeks time to have it again.   The atmosphere is also cool there outside and inside seating.  Almost did not go inside the venue because we didn't see a sign that said south side.  This is a most def, jus based off the chicken and waffles. I promise it's an experience to write about, hence my review :-p"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood classic for us. It seems like anything is if it's reasonably priced and you live in Tremont! While we catch ourselves going more often that we'd like, we're always slightly disappointed by the service and sometimes the food. They're sandwiches and burgers are top-notch- the tremont burger, black bean burger, and steak sandwich are our favorites. And far kid nachos- great late night snack! But they're wings are awful- we've ordered them twice (tried to give them a second chance!) but they're dry, tough, and disappointing. Same goes for the tacos (but you should probably just go down the street to barrio for those anyhow) and the salads are quite small, more like a side than an entree. And brunch is pretty run of the mill, nothing too exciting and we always end up waiting far too long for our food. Stick to dinner here. But I'd give 5 stars to south side on Dyngus Day- fun music, bingo, AMAZING ethnic food.. at least the big dyngus polish boy is always on the menu."}
{"text":"The South Side is what it is: a bar that attempts a slightly upscale menu. When approached with that sobriety it isn't too bad. Sadly, I find that at trying to be both it fails at both.   My wife and I went there on a recommendation of a friend. But our first time there we had a poor experience with the (lack of) service. The waitresses seemed confused as to who was waiting on us even though others in our section were served quickly. After 15 minutes I finally asked the hostess if someone would take our drink order. My wife's wine never came. She tried the chicken and waffles and I had fish off of the specials menu. Both were average meals, but with a dish like chicken and waffles average simply wont do. Its a dish with soul that refuses to taker itself too seriously. The South Side missed the mark.   We were planning on dessert so that we can achieve a minimum $50 tab so we could use our $25 gift certificate but were so anxious to leave that we passed up saving money on our bill. We actually paid more just to leave. I had to go to the bar to pay the bill because our server never returned.  To their credit, when I emailed management to tell them about the poor experience they offered us $50 to come back.   A firm believer in second chances we went again this past weekend. The service was much better but the food was still typical despite being presented better on the menu. The Polish sausage was about as good as I can get at home or in the frozen foods section of the grocery store. The iced tea is fountain (fast food places even fresh brew now), the coffee tasted instant, and my beer was slightly too warm.  Its a bar. That's what it is. And I know much better places to drink."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a road trip from NY to Cedar Point. I heard about the reviews on the fried chicken and waffles so I had to try it myself, and yes! It was really good. The chicken was very crispy breast meat with some fat from the wings. The waffle was perfectly made. The dish was simple but it was of high quality. One thing that's very unique was it's hot sauce that blends perfectly with the dish. It tasted a bit like Sriracha hot sauce but with more garlic. It was so good! The place is very nice. There's a patio outside. Great place to chill in the summer."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. The first time I went it was great food and service. It was awhile later I went back and the service was just awful. I wanted to chalk it up to being a fluke so I went again and received the same slow service. Not worth it at all. Won't be surprised if this place goes out of business, I think people keep going back just because they remember it used to be good. Eventually everyone will realize it's not the same.  If you want chicken and waffles, try Angies Soul Food Cafe, by comparison the south side waffle tastes like a cardboard eggo."}
{"text":"Service was super slow and the food wasn't very good. The flat bread and wings were tasteless. We left disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been coming to South Side for years. The food is awesome as always. My go to has always been the mussels along with the chicken and waffles. You can't go wrong with that combination. Service is always great, and always a great selection of beers. A Tremont gem. A must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love their new menu! The Grilled Romaine salad with chicken is one of my favorite salads of all time."}
{"text":"Excessive wait time. Restrictive and shitty brunch menu. I came to eat lunch on Sunday afternoon and only crappy brunch was available. Skip this place."}
{"text":"The patio is the only redeeming quality of this place imo.  The service is typically bad and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Visited on 7/14/12. I had the blackened grouper sandwich, salad and a blueberry mojito.  I very much enjoyed the grouper sandwich and the salad.  The blueberry mojito was blah !"}
{"text":"My friend lives around the corner and loves this place - otherwise I would not even know how to find it! It is tucked away behind an old building and lots of shrubs around the outside. It is a fun place to just hang out and people watch."}
{"text":"I did not have the food here, but i did have a drink at the bar.   the atmosphere...was not my type of crowd.  tell buffy that the latest trendy place in clevo is crowded, but she and her sisters can meet lots of trendy business professionals who want to be in the know.  wah wah waaaaaaah.  if you need me, i'll be down the street at prosperity."}
{"text":"Went with a fairly large group (7) for dinner on a Friday.  The hostess was a bit rude when we were 10 minutes late for our reservation (granted not the best behavior on our part, but still no excuse in my opinion).  The waitress was nice and very accomodating of our complicated check-splitting.  Food was outstanding.  Blackened grouper sandwich was a standout.  I particularly like the small plate option, and the St. Germain cocktails."}
{"text":"Seriously, South Side?! Your chicken caesar salad has exactly three components: Salad, chicken, and dressing. (Well, ok, five if you count croutons and parmesan cheese). On TWO different occasions, you left out one of the main components. Keep in mind, this was done with takeout orders, where you want to have an easy experience with no hassle. Instead you caused me more hassle.  The first time you left out the chicken. Fail! I called and luckily I live right down the street so I came back and you gave it to me. Damn straight I got my chicken! I didn't pay $8.50 for romaine lettuce.  The second time was last night. You forgot the dressing! And I didn't want to be a total bitch and come back demanding it. But that dressing is frickin' good, and by the way, it's not a caesar salad without that dressing.  Next time I'm half-expecting you to forget the lettuce.  So, I'm torn. It's cheap and fast to order takeout from you guys, and the food tastes good, but half the time you get the order wrong (and one time you'd forgotten to make it and started it when I got there). Don't take advantage of those people who live down the block and can come back for the shit you forgot! A more demanding person would have made you come to my house to give me what you forgot. Or given me something for free.  Somebody just needs to get their act together over there."}
{"text":"The SouthSide: loud, bustling, different  *BBQ PULLED PORK ON FLAT BREAD WITH CHEDDAR AND A FRIED PICKLE"}
{"text":"There was a hair in my steak sandwich! Disgusting! The hair was black,Straight and long, and I have short brown curly hair"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since before I was on yelp, it's so weird reading reviews after I have already experienced the place several times. One thing I will agree on is the mediocre food, I have had some good, some bad, some OK. One thing that is annoying is that the server has never recommended the chicken and waffles to me. I had the crab dip, hummus and roast beef. I'm sure I have tried more menu items and I just don't remember. I remember the roast beef being a complete disappointment and not eating much of it. The crab dip wasn't right, almost had too much crab or something. The hummus was fine.  I like coming here for a quick cocktail before heading out on the weekends. Good bartenders, cool people and the patio is great. Not where I go for a delicious meal, just drinks, scenery and a small bite. My girlfriend did mention the salmon and said it's delicious. Next time I eat here, chicken and waffles or salmon."}
{"text":"We had a great time! Good food, great atmosphere! The grilled cheese and tomato soup was amazing!"}
{"text":"food is super good. cocktails are great. menu is just \"ok\". patio in the summer is horribly understaffed. we get horrible service every time because they have 1 server for 20 tables. we keep coming back because of the food."}
{"text":"I had a lot of friends who have worked at the South Side which has given me great perks like half off drinks. That's a big deal because they stock Blatz (with a lime, please) which retails here for one dollar. But, once the well of free booze ran dry, my opinion started to change. It's loud, it's crowded and it's a little pretentious. The food is good, the drinks are reasonable but something makes me not want to walk in here for, say, a Cavaliers game because I won't be able to pay attention.  Case in point: They used to have the Soprano's on their big plasma television screens during the final season. This, I admit, was both generous (I didn't have cable) and amazing but you'd still have to rent it on DVD because there was no way of knowing what the F was going on.   Nice spot in a great Neighborhood. Ride your bike and get really messy drunk. But don't go for the conversation and bring earplugs, dude."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a bloody Mary. Cleveland Scene Magazine voted this way as well. They will all leave you feeling like you got your money's worth since they all typically come with some sort of accompaniment whether it be a fried jalapeno, fried pickle, or even a half BLT sandwich. They are refreshing and a terrific way to shake off the pains from the previous night. Around $8 a piece also. Highly recommend.  We came here with about ten people for Sunday brunch and they were accommodating to us moving tables to fit us in."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a couple weeks ago. It was AMAZING! The knife and fork burrito was the best I've ever had. The lox and salted caramel cheesecake were tasty, as well. The patio was fun and spacious! Rebecca was a really great server. Very personable and gave great recommendations. Definitely coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Had Southside for lunch a couple of weeks ago and it prompted me to write this review! I have visited this establishment at least a dozen times and am always pleased when I get that great smelling plate of food set down in front of me... I do have to say their Chicken and Waffles are incredible and it takes some serious effort on my part not to order it every time I go there.   Menu is great with a ton of variety and their chefs do an outstanding job of preparing very tasty dishes. This is not a super high end foodie type place but they have consistently served me up great dishes.   Highly recommend to anyone in search of a fun evening out with freinds."}
{"text":"I've been to The Southside twice in the last two months and, in comparison to a few years ago, the quality has slipped significantly.  The first time I ordered the chicken enchiladas, which were bland and last night had the scallops, which were overcooked, dry and way too salty.  I ate some of the asiago chicken sandwich--completely flavorless accompanied by f.rench fries that left a film in my mouth.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to south side for brunch... Biscuits and gravy were terribly bland! Literally had no flavor. Corn beef and hash was overlooked and lacked good flavor too. Chicken and waffles was on point, wish I had ordered more waffles!! Service is also not the kindest"}
{"text":"Just had Sunday brunch here with the fam - crisp, delicious crab cakes with a smooth and flavorful hollandaise sauce. The poached eggs on top were a bit overcooked - it would have been nice to cut into the egg and have the yoke act as a sauce for the cakes. They did have a spicy aioli that was a perfect accompaniment to the cakes. Fun, relaxed environment."}
{"text":"I had a much better experience with my dad last night at the Southside than I had the first and only time I had been. I had pretty much boycotted the place after the last time I was there so it took a BOGO entree offer to get me back. The tables were REAL tables not just the plastic lawn tables as were being used previously. It is quite charming, and the ambiance is the biggest draw. I am still not super impressed by the food, but it is better than Applebee's. The food would get it a 3 star, but the atmosphere brings it up to 4."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sun. afternoon during football season This is nice place to chill & watch the game, grab a good meal & a few drinks. Although I didn't sit at the bar they seemed to have a good selection of liquor & plenty of TVs to watch the game. They have a patio but it was about 50-60 degrees outside but it was enclosed with 3 TVs too. As for the food I tried the chicken & waffles and I'll have to say they weren't bad. I won't say the dish is comparable to Gladys Knights chicken & waffles in Atl. but for Cleveland they were pretty damn GOOD. The waffle came pre treated with the syrup & at first I thought I might need more but I didn't. The waffle was crisp on the outside but nice & soft on the inside. It comes with this cinnamon butter which was nice once it melted over the waffle. As for the chicken, I would have preferred my chicken be deep fried southern style & not tempura style and I wasn't sure if it was a chicken breast or thigh, just a funny looking piece of chicken. The service was great & we did not have to wait long for our food & the place was rather crowded for a Sun. evening. Overall I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great Brunch..Great Bloody Mary.. Brunch is Good.. Tried the Enchiladas and Eggs and was good and the wife tried the florentine crab  Benedict and was good... Great Atmosphere and will be back..."}
{"text":"We came in for a few drinks and appetizers, great atmosphere, food and service.  I highly recommend checking out The South Side!"}
{"text":"Fantastic stuff. Had the pumpkin pasta with a brown sugar, sage and fontina cheese sauce and a handful of perfectly seared scallops. The best pasta dish I've had.  Cool atmosphere for after work dinner and drinks. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So much to say about the South Side. So little wine left in my glass to bother.  Anyhow, at first I liked this bar. I had a great bartender. Okay Bar food (come on , we can only be so picky with only one place still serving food past 1 am in Tremont.) Music was obnoxious, but hey, most places music selections teeter on untolerable.  Then it happened.   First, I had the worst food ever. I go back again. Then, the rudest bartender ever. Who, I come to find out, drunkenly totals a good friend's car days later. ( that's a story for another day) Then, I take my staff out to dinner and the server completely forgets my dinner, never checks back, so it takes me 20 minutes to ask if they would be so gracious to alow me the fine honor of having an entree as well- to which she replies, \"oh, did you order something?\"  Lately I've just noticed a rather uncomfortable vibe and vapid food. Then, one of the bartenders writes a freelance article in Scene magazine attacking any bar business they may have left.  Oh Hi and Dry- they don't hold a candle."}
{"text":"Service was slow and there were many mistakes.  I'm not sure if they were short-staffed last night, but I was not impressed.  I had the chicken and waffles, which was fair."}
{"text":"So I had to laugh when, after having read the reviews, we got the MMA waiter!  Fortunately, he must have gotten the memo and service was actually fine.     The atmosphere wasn't super amazing where we sat in an \"indoor patio\" and the table was just way too small for four people as we were constantly juggling plates.  Then, pretty much right after we met our friends and sat down, they came over all worried and wondered if we'd be done by seven because they needed the table for someone else.  Kind of odd - we didn't move.    The apps were ok - hummus and some kind of stuffed pepper.  Pretty standard.  The bloody mary was like tomato juice with some dill pickle jar juice tossed in - I have never tasted dill in one before so that was odd.  I wouldn't order it again.    My husband ordered a black bean burger and it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  It was a major disappointment.     I ordered a portabello gyro and it was also not exciting, and I didn't taste any wasabi anywhere in that thing.   I left half of it behind.      I wouldn't go here again.  We drove past Lolita after dinner with our mouths watering, being kicked by our own feet for this choice."}
{"text":"HICKORY GRILLED WINGS WITH HOT SAUCE.  Wow.  wow.  wow.  And the tomato and pepperoni Flatbread with banana peppers was really good, too.  As always, I got a side salad with cucumber Wasabi dressing...my fave.  I love how Southside has stepped up its food game!!"}
{"text":"Love the fish and chips, the steak sandwich, and the environment. Great beer selection and lots of seating - great if you're looking to watch the game or just a night out"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait the Chicken  and waffles are to die for even though the wait was long the staff apologized time after time love this place the vibe is great the eggplant  starter was awesome  best place I've been too yet   Josh great  Anna and Antigone where super friendly  and really professional"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat here for brunch a few weeks ago and it was great. The atmosphere was super trendy and extremely hip for the area, I was in love with the brick walls inside and the cute little patio outside. I got the knife and fork breakfast burrito and it was super tasty and filling, and the potatoes were awesome. He got the chicken enchiladas and eggs and was a huge fan as well. You definitely got your moneys worth for the amount of food you got! Our waiter was a little slow and we had to wait some time for the check and to get our card back, but other than it it was a perfect little spot for  Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"We had terrible service and the food was mediocre. Our server never came back after the food was dropped off by someone else. I shouldn't have to track down my own napkins and water refills when I go out to eat. It's also pretty pricy for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Had our staff Christmas Party.  It was very nice.  We were in the back room near the fireplace where it was nice and cozy.  Menu has a Spanish and American flair to it!  I had the vegetarian pasta.  Made with a light cream sauce with zesty garlic, mushroom, spinach and peppers!  It was delicious!   A good selection of wine.  I had spanish coffee which was great and hit the spot on a cold night.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a week or so ago with some coworkers! I loved the different options, friendly staff and beautiful building. I got the winter cobb salad, and it was a fun spin on the traditional cobb salad. I wish I would have taken a photo, because it was presented so beautifully! I keep seeing so many awesome brunch reviews - so I am looking forward to coming back for that too!"}
{"text":"This place has good decor, decent service, and friendly staff.  Their alcoholic beverages were pleasant.  As far as the food is concerned, it's average.  I felt the dishes were inconsistent in taste.  One dish would be a fail while the next plate would be tasty.  Overall, there was always a fault on the plate."}
{"text":"Fat Kid Nachos and Chicken and Waffles made for an unbeatable app-entree combo. Modern atmosphere with a good menu. Service was average, but definitely give the playlist a 10/10"}
{"text":"Love this spot.  Always great service; even the bar staff are especially accomodating!  Have lots of favorites including the Mussels and Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"Boy does this place smell!! In the good way!! Can I say something? Fantastic. Thanks for letting me say something! So far I've had a Bloody Mary and can I say something else? Hold the Mary next time! Yummy. I ORDERED THE CHEMMYCHENGOS AND THEYRE WERE BLOODIER THAN THE DRINK (I don't get it either).   Side note: very TRENDY and cool place! Pretty modern. Man these urinals are neat.  Second side note: my buddy asked for some olives, and the wait staff that was assigned to us, had no problem giving him some.   There was an issue with my glass dripping, and at the time I didn't have a napkin on my lap so they sure will be getting a bill.   Whew. I'm ready to sit in the recliner my dog bought me (on my wife's behalf) and take a load off. Everyone enjoy their day off because I know my dog will. Ha! That ones for the kids! YELP!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  We used to come here from 45 minutes away for their food, but their bitchy service and slow/cold food is not worth the trip, even if you're local.  We come for chicken and waffles, and of all things, they skimp on the butter and syrup, so it tells you those cost more than the chicken and waffle.  Things could get better, but it's Ohio, so service and quality is expected to be poor."}
{"text":"This place has just about everything you would like in a bar/restaurant. They have a patio, indoor/outdoor fireplace,  setting for groups, tremont vibe but has flat screens too for sporting events! I have celebrating my birthday here before and had a great experience!!! Food never disappoints and service was point on. Everyone gets the chicken and waffles..I have yet to try but one of my favs is the Spicy Pan Fried Calamari."}
{"text":"Watched a game here on Sunday. I ordered one of their cocktails, Lady Red. Very good cocktail list. We got a dessert the salted Carmel Chocolate cake one. So good. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad dish here and I truly have tried a lot of different things from their menu.  I absolutely love getting the hummus/pita and the garden salad.  They're also known for delicious chicken and waffles.  I tried one of their martinis off the drink menu and it was fabulous!  Only down side I'd have to say is it is usually crowded and noisy inside (typical bar I guess) especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere; candle lights, dim house lighting, and games on the three large flat screens (perfect for the hubby). We were looking for somewhere to eat on a late Friday after having no luck downtown due to parking. It is set in a neighborhood and if you aren't looking for it you will drive right past it.  Started with the Almost Human and Take Me There. Both were fruity enough for me, but strong enough for my husband. Next I had the Mac and Cheese with Bacon. When I say it was \"to die for\" I mean it!! He had the Chicken and Waffles and the condiments with this meal were mouth watering. The hot sauce was perfect and the cinnamon butter paired well with the waffle. We finished our meal off with the Caramel Creme Brûlée Cheesecake. Everything was new and different tasting, I couldn't believe we had never been there before. Will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"If your coming here you need to get a Bloody Mary, the selections are crazy including one with a garnish of grilled cheese or one with a jalapeño popper.  Brunch was great, came for dinner once and wasn't as impressed as I was for brunch."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant... I think of it a twist on classical American.  The food is approachable, well prepared, and always a hit.  They change their menu with the season, and often have specials.  It's definitely one of my favorite spots in Tremont (excellent food at a reasonable price)  My current favorite menu items include an amazing Cobb salad.  It's a huge portion, the dressing is great and it's has a nice mixture of ingredients.  I also love the Mussels (so good!).  If you're there for brunch... don't overlook the open face grilled cheese (at $6 you won't be disappointed!)  The bar is decent... I'm not a fan of their mixed drinks - but overall their beer selection is pretty good.  It's generally not the place I'd stumble home from - unless I was grabbing late night food (they serve until 2am!)"}
{"text":"Huge beer and cocktail menu. Great food! Good service. Very cool atmosphere. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food was good and tasty, reasonably priced.  The service was inconsistent.  They basically forgot about us.  They never checked on us once we had our food.  We ordered a beer and had to go up to the bar to bring it to our own table.  The restaurant was not crowded in the least, maybe 10 customers.  The staff was too busy socializing with themselves to give much courtesy to the customers."}
{"text":"The mac & cheese is to die for!  I have never had a bad experience at the Southside.  Their servers are fun with lots of personality.  All of their drinks have also been tasty and their prices aren't obnoxious like other places in the Tremont area.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Thursday night just to grab a few drinks, ended up deciding to grab food as well. Overall this place is great. The service was great from beginning to end. Pictured below are wings and the Big Chicken Sandwich which I would highly recommend both. The menu is simple but it also has a variety of options for any type of dinner. I definitely plan to come back and explore the menu a bit more. A tell tell sign that the food is good at a restaurant is the look you get or give when you see food that you haven't ordered come out! This place will definitely give you that feeling! Highly recommend trying it if your in the Tremont area!"}
{"text":"1.5 hours for a table of 6 tonight??!?  All because Andy, Jimmy, and Stevie + significant others wouldn't move after they closed out an hour ago.  If there's only 1 table for 6, might as well call this place Party Of Five. Hell, Neve Campbell wouldn't even get a table here.  This place makes me want to SCREAM."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  Great atmopshere overall, and patio is superior for summertime, just the right size to not feel out of place but still small enough to be able to see two outdoor TV's if you want to keep your eyes peeled on a game.  Indoor has a tendency to get a little noisy late night Friday/Saturday but still just below average.  Cost:  Similar to upscale bar food prices, no highway robbery but not dirt cheap either.  $8-$13 for most filling meals.  Food Quality:  Topic of much heated debate, but overall I think the food deserve a 4.  Yes, the Chicken and Waffles are overrated -- very similar to what you'll get in other cities but it's nice being able to get it nearby.  Other menu options are hit or miss, some amazing and others rather lackluster so I wouldn't let one food experience dictate a review.   Great standouts include the grouper, chicken wings, enchiladas, and salads (featuring the rather unique cucumber wasabi dressing).  Misses include the tuna appetizer and lobster rolls among others.  Service:  This is where a 4 review became a 3.  I have had some decent experiences, but as a general rule Southside service is atrocious.  Forgetting about tables / mismanagement of who has what tables, not coming back to see how things are going for more drinks/water etc, is very frustrating especially if you're out to drink heavily with friends or in a reasonable hurry.  When to return: Great summer place to sit out on the patio when NOT in a hurry.  Sunday brunch is nice as many have said, and also makes for a decent place to come on any weekday for a casual dinner with friends."}
{"text":"We've been to The South Side a few times now and you can't really go wrong here! The Herb-Roasted Portobello Gyro is amazing! I'd also recommend the Grilled Swordfish, or the Spinach Cobb Chicken Salad. So good!  Plus, they have a great outside patio which is awesome in the summer if you can get a seat. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food! The crispy calamari with julienne vegetables, grilled shrimp with fried green tomatoes and Mac and cheese with pulled chicken were all perfect for sharing.. Never a disappointment"}
{"text":"The South Side is a very cute restaurant with yummy shareable dishes.  Earlier that day, my coworkers and I were discussing chicken + waffles, and how you can only get the dish in LA or NYC.  But, lo and behold, you can get it in Cleveland too!  It's not quite what it's supposed to be (the chicken looked like stuff from kiddy TV dinners), but it was a good try.  I love the design of the outdoor dining area; the ambiance and decor worked really well with the lightning storm that enthralled us that evening.  Good drink list and great location."}
{"text":"Consistently good food in a fun atmosphere.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Service is very attentive."}
{"text":"My favorite Sunday brunch in Cleveland is at Southside. I love the brunch enchiladas here! I can't believe this place only has 3.5 stars. The Bloody Mary list has some awesome options too! Like the \"Grilled cheese Mary\" that comes with a grilled cheese (with bacon) you can dip in your Bloody Mary, Awesome! Service was great too."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed SouthSide yet???  I LOVE THIS PLACE!  chicken and waffles is epic, black bean burger is the best in town, hummus platter is great, cocktails are really good, beer list has something for everyone.  The outside patio is awesome for summer, the inside patio is awesome for cooler days when they have a fire, the people are usually good looking, it's like they have a bouncer at the door who keeps ugly people out, but, luckily, he never stopped me!  Tremont is a ghost town on Sunday morning, but South Side is there for you when you need a little mimosa or bloody mary action... or maybe a blueberry lemonade?"}
{"text":"Anyplace that has a drink list for breakfast is A-OK in my book! They have about 7 different Bloody Mary offerings ranging from classic to one served with a fried pickle and a can of Blatz. Not to mention they have about 15 other drinks, all which sound absolutely amazing. I didn't have a drink this time but I have had the Bloody Caesar in the past which is a bloody mary made with Clamato, can we say yum?!  This particular brunch, I enjoyed the smoked salmon platter and it was very good although nothing can compare to my first South Side experience, the chicken and waffles! All I can say is get the chicken and waffles and thank me afterwards.   There is a parking lot dedicated to South Side diners which makes parking convenient and eliminates the hassle of trolling the Tremont streets. Both times, our service has been less than stellar. I get it, you can't expect 5 star service at a brunch joint in Tremont on a Sunday but there's no excuse for not refilling drinks and not checking back after delivering the food to the table. These are server basics which should be mastered by anyone working in this industry, not so here. We were going to have a drink at the bar before we were seated outside and the bartender was friendly and attentive, we probably should have just eaten at the bar in retrospect.   Sub-par service and all, this place still rates a 5 in my book, the chicken and waffles are THAT good!"}
{"text":"Woo, very polarized sets of reviews here.    I'm going to come down on the decent side with a generous 4.  The service when I went was quite reasonable, and the food was reasonably brisk.  The decor and food selection is eclectic, with a sense of a place created for the locals in tremont, which are an eclectic group from many age groups and walks of life.  Had pigs in a blanket, which while a bit on the unhealthy side, were paired with simply scrumptious tiny cubed hashbrowns.  The zesty onions and peppers sauteed in were delightful.  The eggs were coated in a bit more oil than I'd like, but overall the flavours were pleasing.  More visits would be necessary to see whether I agree with the concerns about spotty service or food quality.  But my first visit merits a 3.5 averaged to 4."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with cute patio, airy porch type enclosure, and bar area with indoor seating.   Chicken and waffles was heavenly. Be aware, though, the chicken is bone in and it is tempura battered. Both were a surprising stray from how you'd traditionally find that dish prepared; however, it was delicious.   BF got the chorizo burger and loved it. I took a bite and confirmed its tastiness."}
{"text":"The happy hour was great! Got 4 drinks and an appetizer with my husband for $35 including tip. Food was amazing and drinks were great. Patio is a nice set up and bathrooms are very clean. Service both behind the bar and at our table was fantastic. Try the chicken and waffles...life changing!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good first experience with South Side, but not wow-worthy quite yet!  I definitely enjoyed myself on the patio on a warm summer evening. I got the portobello gyro, which had portobello, mozzarella, and a creamy slightly spicy sauce. I had a very plentiful side of chips. The vegetarian dishes look to be a-ok.  I'll have to come back to try the lobster bisque that I keep hearing about! I had a taste of my bf's grouper sandwich, and I think I'd like to go back and try more.  As for the service, I had a pretty good experience with it. From the reviews, this seems to be hit or miss!"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with dinner and drinks at South Side! Never disappoints."}
{"text":"The standby: whenever the fridge is bare, the leftovers should be turned over or the friends from out of town need a bite to eat, you turn to this place and it offers you the comfort of certainty - and you only grow fonder of it each time.  For me and so many in my neighborhood of Tremont, this place is The Southside - and it just occurred to me that I've taken it for granted. Since when is my trusty Southside not good enough for a special occasion and what point did I falsely associate it with mundane.   So I returned to celebrate a lovely birthday dinner with some of the loveliest people I know. Offering up delectable specialties like chicken waffles and three cheese chicken mac and cheese, or more traditional favorites like Spinach Cobb and Kobe burger, all celebratory participants ordered up a delightful array of pallet pleasers.- including my personal favorite, Duck Pizza.   With a price point comparable to sit down McDonald's (that would be Applebee's), hours exceeding just about everywhere else in Tremont and slightly swanky yet chill atmosphere, Southside is appropriate for just about any time - and I've had just about any time: World cup and Cav's games, Birthday 25 and birthday 28, first dates (just a few) an anniversary (just one), family brunches, Mimosa brunches and oh yes - business meetings.  Complete with three main sections: bar with high tops, an all seasons room with fireplace and sizable patio, how tragic for anyone to skip over what I've found to be such a staple. So I give it all five stars and stand by my standby."}
{"text":"As an early birthday present one of my closest gal-pal's insisted I visit Tremont with her for drinks and lunch.  First stop, South Side.  Well, it's been a while since I've been to Tremont, (not to give away my age or anything) but the last time I'd been to the Tremont area I carried mace and wish I had a gun, or at least bigger muscles - not exactly someplace I'd choose to go for a fun, relaxing birthday lunch.  But, I'm brave, and it was her treat, so I obliged.  I'm so glad I did!  I still had my mace, but I never felt like I needed to use it - well, maybe once at one cat-caller in a beat up pick up truck, but only because of his perverse remarks, not any perceived threat of physical harm.    REVIEW: We arrived to South Side at 11:35 AM, just a few minutes after they opened, and we were greeted and seated promptly.  Our hostess gave us a choice of indoor or outdoor seating and they day was perfect so out we went.  The patio is surrounded in trees and other attractive plants that give you a sense of privacy while allowing you to get your daily dose of vitamin D.    Martini anyone? Our server was well pleased that we were ordering from this particular menu before noon - who doesn't?  The beverage selection was plenteous and NOT boring.  I ordered the Summer Lovin' - a mix of Absolute Acai and Citron with Basil and simple syrup - YUM, while my friend ordered a Hendrix Gin and Champagne martini.  Double YUM.  We shared the Artichoke and Crab dip with pita points as an appetizer, indulged in the Sorrano Pepper soup and shared a Portobello Gyro with homemade chips.  We were stuffed full of wonderful food and beverages and before the tip the check was only $55!  (!!!!!!!)  Amazing.  As a previous yelper posted, I'd truly give the place 4.5 stars because of a pesky delivery truck that was permitted to sit running outside of the patio far too long (he should have politely been asked to shut off the engine after 20 minutes but it was more like 30 before he did).  More his fault than theirs so five stars it is!"}
{"text":"Great stuffed pepper app. Megan was awesome and called us a car service.  Out of town but felt at home in this clean and friendly place."}
{"text":"2 words. LOBSTER BISQUE!!!!!   Member that episode of Seinfeld, when Elaine is like: \"We went to dinner, I ordered the lobster bisque, went back to his place yada yada yada yada, went home the next morning.\" and Jerry is like \"You yada yada yada'd right past the best part!\" and Elaine says, \"oh no I mentioned the bisque.\" That is South Side's bisque......I'm serious it is that friggin' good!  I've only been here a few other times and had their burger, salads & beer (all delicious)...but nothing compares to their lobster bisque. *drool*"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Recently had the grouper sandwich at the Southside.  It was, by far, the most horrid and absolutely greasy mess I've ever attempted to eat.  It was the equivalent of soaking a sponge in pink grease, placing it between two halves of a bun, picking it up to your face, and squeezing down.  Nothing but disgusting, pink grease running off the fish.  I could have gagged.  Now, on to my original review...  Awful in so many ways it hurts.  THE UP-SIDE:  If you stand outside the windows at the South Side and look in, you'll find yourself convinced that it really is a great little restaurant.  However, step inside...  THE DOWN-SIDE:  First thing you'll notice, too freakin loud.  While the place looks pretty nice with the lighting, etc, the loud and awful selection of music blows the vibe completely.  You will barely be able to hear your dinner companions.  Once you wait for an eternity to be seated and place an order, you will notice the decidedly sub-par food.  For all the flash and high-end posing, this place offers some not-so-wonderful food.    Ok, it might not be bad for a local corner bar type selection, but this place is striving to present itself as something far from that.  In turn, you end up feeling like those poor tourists that get taken for a ride on a shell game in New York City.  \"Should have known better,\" you'll find yourself thinking.  And so it goes.  The servers are full of attitude and practically ignore you.  The food bites and you cannot even hear the people you are there with.   THE SUM-IT-UP:  Skip this god-awful Tremont poser.  There are far more satisfying experiences to be found nearby."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! We sat on the patio and got the benefit of the fireplace, brick walls and a roof while still being outside. Food was better than average. The boys both had the chicken and waffles, which were decadent. Service was much better than we expected given the reviews. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Delicious and wonderful atmosphere! We called and made a reservation since we had a large party and the table was ready and waiting when we got there... I had a Tremont burger  which was cooked to perfection.  The bacon added a nice crunch and the HUGE onion ring stacked on top of the burger was an added bonus.  The burger came with homemade chips that were nicely seasoned, and I washed everything down with \"packed punch,\" which was light, fruity, and fizzy (all things I like in a drink). I would definitely order this same meal again. There is an extensive drink menu, and they all sound very good (friends I was with all enjoyed their drink selections as well). Service was good; we had carafes of water constantly being refilled on the table and everyone got exactly what they asked for.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We stopped in The Southside to watch a Browns game and try their brunch menu. I hear this place is pretty popular on Sundays, but we were still able to get a great spot at the bar by one of the TVs, and a few tables were also open.   They have a pretty good beer selection with lots of crafts and locals, and it looked like they had a Bloody Mary bar open, too.   I ordered the steak and eggs with French toast and apple bacon compote. It was excellent.   I didn't get a chance to walk around the entire restaurant, but I loved the ambiance - gotta love historic buildings converted to modern venues. I'll definitely be going back...especially to try to get a seat in the dining room area by the fireplace."}
{"text":"Best lobster bisque ever! Alaina is my favorite bartender. She's always got something good to chat about and great suggestions. Doesn't hurt that she's easy on the eyes too"}
{"text":"Give me the spicy calamari app, sea bass, and few good beers and I'm having a blast! I've been to SouthSide many times in the past few months. In fact it was a weekly go-to spot for my small group of friends. The food is great and drinks are moderately priced with good beers always on tap.    Sometimes it can be quite crowded and getting a good high-top table is difficult but sitting at the bar is satisfying. Wait staff and bartenders are cool. Have always been attentive and conversational (when they're not slammed). DJ spins on certain nights which can be nice and annoying at the same time. Hip, trendy crowd packs the bar on weekends.  I've even introduce the place to some friends who don't frequent the trendy joints (more of a fast food, corner bar type of couple) around town and they loved it. +1 for me! Get there if you haven't been."}
{"text":"I just feel like this place isn't very consistent. Most of the time when I come here the food is good, but not great. The service is ALWAYS slow. Today I joined a table and sat for 15 minutes without the server even stopping by. Server was too busy flirting and talking to a bar guest. The stuffed peppers are good, but the price point is awful. $10 for two tiny peppers? Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that has everything I could want in a summer hang out. Great menu, awesome patio and good people watching.   First the menu. I had the blackened grouper sandy and it was awesome. Also I got a side salad instead of the fries (watching my lbs of course) and it was really good too. It's also one of those menus that has a ton of things that look really good and you just aren't sure what to get so you cross your fingers you are making a good choice. Everyone at our table was really happy with their meals a we showed those plates who were boss.   The only draw back was our waitress was the type that would have gotten employee of the month at Dick's Last Resort. I never understood that chain as a concept and don't understand that snarky/borderline bitchy attitude in regular restaurant staff.   Still looking forward to going back, I'm sure I won't get sat in her section again... I mean, probably not anyway..."}
{"text":"I have now been to South Side twice in the last week, and I have a few things I love about this place and a few things I was disappointed with.   First of all, their Happy Hour is fantastic! It goes until 7:30 or 8 and that includes Fridays!  It's a selection of $5 appetizers  and $3 pints from their draft beer list.  It is definitely the way to go with friends or a night out!  Also, the dinner food I had was really delicious!  We got Hummus to start, and you can tell it was homemade.  I really enjoyed it but it is definitely not as smooth as other hummus's I've had so if you are not a chick pea fan it may not be for you.  It comes with hot grilled pita which is also delicious.  For dinner I got the blackened grouper sandwich - as many other of these reviews also rave about - I will be on that band wagon and say it is absolutely delicious!! Cooked perfectly, seasoned well on a delicious roll.  I would go there again and have that sandwich!   Now some things that need some improvement, their cocktails!  When we first got there we had to wait for our table so we went up to the bar and got a happy hour cocktail, my friend and I each got a different one.  Neither of us could finish them.  They were WAY too sweet and just watery almost, I am not one to leave a drink, ever.  And I probably had 5 sips and didn't touch it.  Secondly, the vegetarian options for brunch.  The second time I came here was for brunch, I am currently not eating meat and could not find a single item that was vegetarian besides the french toast.  I ended up getting an omelet and substituting the meat for spinach, the omelet itself was good, but for the price was a VERY small portion.  Probably only 2 eggs used in the omelet and then very small portion of has browns and no toast or anything.  A few of the other people I were with got the fried steak, biscuits and gravy and the enchiladas and all really enjoyed their meals so I will be giving it another try once I start eating meat again.   But as far as the Bloody Mary's that everyone raves about, it's cool that they come with some sort of garnsih or side, like you can even get a grilled cheese with it.  I would say it's a cool concept but the mix they use is not good.   I suggest you give it a try for yourself and you'll be happy but I wouldn't beg people to come back with me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a solid 4-star for the food and drink, and I've been here plenty of times for their Sunday brunch, but this last time we also had my 16 month-old grandson.  They don't have high chairs. Really? No high chairs?  I realize it's a trendy, millennials hot spot, but are the childless not permitted to enjoy?  Our group of five was forced to play \"pass the kid\" and I spent most of the meal carrying or walking him around the restaurant (too cold to go outside). The others felt as if they had to eat quickly to give me a chance to dine.  It was just uncomfortable for all of us.  Don't get me wrong. I'll be back. Just not with the little one.   I'm sure it's an owner decision not to have high chairs because it's a image thing, but maybe common courtesy would change that. When we walked in, I said 5 and a high chair.  The hostess said, \"This way\".  If she had said that they didn't have high chairs, we at least could have had the option to try some place else. It wasn't until we were seated that were we informed.  So we toughed it out.  Thank goodness the food and service are good."}
{"text":"South Side is great.  They have an awesome menu with loads of variety, the food is good, and the atmosphere is cozy yet cool.  Although I came here strictly to eat and drink, this would be a nice place to watch sports, too.  Our waitress was very personable and even though the restaurant was pretty busy, everything was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.   I had the turkey and swiss panini and a glass of Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold (a special treat for me since I can't get it in Arizona).  Others in my party had the steak sandwich, goat cheese & duck salad, and the bison & black bean chili.  Someone had a Raspberry Beret martini.  See what I mean?  The menu basically has everything you could be in the mood for.  The food quality itself is a solid 4, not 5 stars.  It's good but not amazing.  Better, more varied, and more classy than most bars though, and like I said, great atmosphere in the bar area."}
{"text":"The Southside is a quaint little restaurant in tremont with not so special food. I might be a little harsh with my rating but I really didn't like the chicken and waffles. They were trying to make a simple classic too fancy. The chicken wasn't you're standard fried chicken...it was covered in soggy tempura breading and The waffle was drenched.   I willsay that the ambiance and service were great. We were a big group seated right next to the fire place. Everyone else at the table seemed to really enjoy their food. I'll try it again but I'll definitely steer clear from the waffles!"}
{"text":"Famous for their chicken and waffles and hearing that they have 1/2 off appetizers on Wednesdays, I headed to South Side. I went here a couple of times already and both times were exceptionally good. Service was great and no complaints at all. Went here with a friend after hearing so much of their mussels. I love mussels and this place is awesome. For $10, you get a bowl of mussels with a sauce to die for and some ciabetta bread. The portions are generous and it could probably feed 2 people but for a person who loves mussels as much as I do, I could probably finish it myself.   The first time I came, we ordered their wings, mussels, and their blackened grouper. The sandwich was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a citrus taste to it so it might taste a little sour for some people. The mussels were delicious and the wings weren't anything spectacular. We got the spicy cajun ones and they weren't that spicy to begin with but the size of the wings were good enough.  The second time I came back was a few weeks after and the mussels were still good. However, this time we ordered the chicken and dumplings and enchiladas. The enchiladas were good and liked how they paired it with the cilantro aioli sauce because it gives that tang taste to it. I haven't had any of their beers but they do have a great variety of great lake beers and some on draft.   It's a gastropub so it's a great place to bring a group of friends and eat some really good food. I haven't experienced their patio experience yet but they have a great fireplace area and I'd consider that as their sun room, which is well heated so you're not literally sitting outside."}
{"text":"We went on a cool day and were seated in the glassed-in patio area.  It was very cold and the glass reflected a lot of sounds making it uncomfortably noisy.  We waited a very long time for our server to come and take our order and then we waited a very long time for the food to arrive.  Our waitress was not particularly friendly, but took at least she got our orders correct.  I ordered the fried chicken with waffles.  When my food came, it was a small-ish piece of fried chicken on what looks like an out-of-the-box Eggo waffle.  The small piece of chicken was pretty good but the waffle was literally sopping with syrup, the whole plate was full of it.  All you could taste was syrup.  Why would you do that?  Why wouldn't you provide your clientele with their own syrup so they can add the amount they want?  Strangely, the other pictures on Yelp don't show the waffles swimming in syrup so I don't know if they slipped that day when they were pouring the syrup or what.  When we finished eating, we waited for a very very long time for the check to arrive.  I think all in all, we must have been here for over an hour and we didn't order that much food.  We ended up being late getting back to work.  Overall, our experience was very lack luster.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not real life. Confused space hosted an assortment of TVs with wrestling, fake fireplaces, and autumnesque decorations.   Cool lights over the bar though. Suspended vase shape lamps enclose the bulbs while long stem flowers run up from the vases hiding the electrical cords. Look up look up!"}
{"text":"Great late night spot. Grouper sandwich and the wings are the best. Kitchen is open late."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way! Wish I could give more. Great food, service, drinks and even the management rocks! Here on a crazy, short staffed Friday night and still getting amazing service and feeling the love. I love this place!"}
{"text":"One of those places you just really want to like... But is mediocre over and over. I like the bar and dining room, drink selection is good... Food is just decent. Went today for lunch- hummus is good surprisingly, flatbread was pretty over sauced with a white sauce (with a side of one eyelash!).  I guess I'm not sure what to write in this review since it's so mediocre... Meh. Oh, and they used to have a portobello gyro on the menu that was actually very good, now it's gone."}
{"text":"After trying to go to Hot Sauce Williams at around 12 only to find out that they were closed (it says open until 1:30am smh), I decided to check out The South Side with my friend. We both live in LA (she was born and raised in Tremont) and saw that this place had \"Chicken and Waffles\" and we automatically thought of Roscoe's Chicken N Waffles so we had to try it.   Service was excellent. I can't remember my water cup ever going past the half way point because our server brought a new cup of water before that happens. ALSO, I want to mention how they said they'd still serve even if we come in a minute before they close, that just shows how awesome their service is.   Now the food. I liked how it looked: One big waffle on the bottom, fried chicken on top of the waffle, and their AMAZING maple, cinnamon, sugar butter sitting on the hot chicken to melt down to the waffles.   The chicken was fried in a tempura batter. Not a fan of bones, and somehow they knew that (lol) and the chicken had one small bone on the side while the rest was all chicken (white meat). They also give you a side of sriracha. It's a bit of an Asian style but the chicken n waffle that we eat, needs Louisiana Hot Sauce! It was good, but let's remember it gets really oily and you start to feel ehhh.   The waffles were different than your usual waffles: after it is made, they're deep fried for a nice crispy finish. Sounds delicious eh? However, this too gets overwhelming with its oil and grease and nothing on the plate can really soak up the oily taste out of my mouth from the chicken, so you start to feel sick in the latter portion of your meal.   Im giving it 4 stars for the place, atmosphere, and excellent service. If what I ordered was good to about amazing... I would definitely give it 5 stars  The place looks nice inside and the beer selection is great.  Recommendation: Louisiana Hot Sauce, Syrup on the side, Something for the chicken and waffle dish to lighten the heaviness of the meal (fruits?)"}
{"text":"One of the favorites for dinner and drinks in the Tremont area. Great place to go to before heading downtown for a sports game or night out. Tried the calamari, chicken and waffles (a favorite), and fat kid nachos. All are awesome! Quiet atmosphere that stays busy, with a nice outdoor patio area that's semi covered."}
{"text":"Originally gave this restaurant 3 stars, but have been back twice since and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite dinner spots. I still feel as though the food could use a bit more work. I have mostly returned for the classy, yet unpretentious, feel of this place.  But I recently had the PEI mussels with chorizo and the macaroni and cheese with crispy chicken and was a fan of both. The gruyere adds a nice complement to the onions and peppers in this dish."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast after a late night out in Cleveland. The service was friendly, and fast. The food also came out fast, but my breakfast was not that great.   I was stuck between the Knife and Fork Breakfast Burrito and the Breakfast Enchiladas. I asked for guidance from our waitress, whom pushed me towards the enchiladas. We were also intrigued by \"Cowboy Sauce\"-- fun sauce names always get us! They were only okay, kind of dry on the inside as well. FYI, Cowboy Sauce seems to taste like a cilantro mustard. I saw others who ordered the burrito and that looked FANTASTIC! I definitely made the wrong choice! Oh well. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, and that was very good.  If you're in the same situation as I, go with the BURRITO!"}
{"text":"This place is a No-Brainer! Long bar for the Bar flys! Quaint in-the-front window seating for Show Offs! Bistro tables for Bar flys in denial! Inside seating outside...which means, you're outside on the patio but have open doors surrounding you in case of inclement weather! Complete outside seating with or w/o umbrellas to shield you from the sun's beating heat! ...and... a two sided fireplace that goes from the inside outside patio and the real deal, outside. .. Located in swanky Tremont. ..what more is there beside the best priced food and drinks!   TaDa..   See Y'all back there soon...I've dined waaay more than I have checked in! Maybe 10+ more..."}
{"text":"Best blackened GROUPER sandwich with homemade citrus mayo and bread. You MUST try it. The fries are freshly cut. I also love the grilled cheese sandwich and add egg.    Tuesdays there are half-off appetizers.   Prices are reasonable. A nice meal is about $18 and a good sandwich is like $12 or so.   The menu changes often. I was sad when scallops and gnocchi were changed out.   It's one of the few lounges that serves food late in Cleveland!  I love the atmosphere. There is a bar, a cozy sun room with a fireplace, and a patio. I have seen a rat there once (patio) and a mouse (sunroom) but it is just an old building and I think it has character.   GREAT for brunch on Sundays."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. There were 6 of us service was great and food was fabulous. Our favorites were the blackened grouper, big dyngus, and el chappo.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for the weekend and I had the strangest craving for chicken and waffles so my Yelp search led me to The South Side. I was a little hesitant since I'm one of those people who cringe when anything sweet and syrupy mixes with savory. My hubby and I along with his guy friend visited this place on a Friday night, around 9:30. It wasn't crazy busy inside because most of the patrons decided to sit outside.  I'm glad I chose to sit indoors as there was a person who complained fireflies were getting into their food =X   My hubby and I decided to get the Chicken and Waffles while our friend ordered the Pan Fried Chicken Cutlets along with the mussels appetizer. Our food took quite a bit longer to be served than we'd have liked but the wait was worth it. I asked for the syrup, powdered sugar, and cinnamon butter to be placed on a separate plate rather than on the actual chicken and waffle because I was scared I wouldn't like the combo all together. I smeared or actually dumped the whole container of Sriracha on my chicken and dove in. It was hot, juicy, crispy, and spicy all at the same time. Then I put the cinnamon butter, powdered sugar, and syrup on my waffle and again same thing--hot, crispy, melty, and spicy. Then I figured what the hey, I'll just eat it all together like it was meant to and I was a happy girl. Honestly Chicken and Waffles are just one of those combinations that are just too sinful for the average person. Our friend was also quite happy with his chicken dish and the mussels were on point with a rich, savory broth that we dipped our crispy baguette slices into. If we could, we would have drank the entire bowl of broth!  Our waiter was friendly and funny but service was kind of slow. It took almost an hour after we were finished eating to get our check. The guys did order another round of beer but it doesn't take that long to drink it. The bathroom also needed some attending to at the end of the night but at midnight, I think any place does. I would like to come again and try the other dishes but hopefully they'll take note of the above critiques."}
{"text":"Great spot to go for many occasions. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. On many occasions I have looked to them for advice on what to get and have never been disappointed.  They have brunch on the weekends. With elaborate Bloody Mary options and a chicken and waffles out of this world. I would advise!"}
{"text":"Went here for a week day brunch and I was impressed by how many people where here.  But the main reason I am giving it the full 5 stars in DEEP FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! I mean not only is the chicken deep fried, the waffle is too.  I also go the mac and cheese and it is was the creamy kind that I really like. Great food, great services!"}
{"text":"I have the cheeseburger and fries, very good. Also tired the pizza, very good. I got to try the other food so i will be back.  Make sure in the winter to dress up, it's kind of cold in there for some reason."}
{"text":"After my previous experience here, the manager reached out to me to apologize for the terrible service my boyfriend and I experienced. She listened to our story, was extremely kind and understanding, and invited us back out. I was hesitant, but am glad we returned. I'm not sure if the drunk server we first witnessed is still employed here, but we haven't seen her, and the service has definitely improved. We've been back a few times now since then, and the service has always been attentive, and of course the food amazing. I don't know if they had just one bad egg working that day, But glad SouthSide is back up to par! Love coming here late night after work for some incredible food."}
{"text":"Best brunch place in town ever with the best price. I took my friend from Pittsburgh there and she told me she would visit there every day if she lived at Cleveland. I almost tried every single thing on their brunch menu. Chicken and Waffle is their most popular dish and it is absolutely fabulous. The only downside is that it is a little heavy. However, it is fried chicken and waffle, which means they are tasty but heavy ha ha what else do you expect. BTW, try their spicy sauce; it is the best.   My personal favorite is the crab cakes. Delicious with a reasonable price. Also it is healthier and works for building a better beach body.  My friend is big for french toast (that Pitts kid) and the restaurant added marshmallow on top of french toast. According to her, it was very good.  I tried their cucumber bloody mary too - (they have so many options) and it tastes so refreshing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their brunch menu.  Enchiladas and eggs are so good.  My friends love their breakfast burrito more than anyone else's.  If you like your Bloody Mary spicy you will absolutely love the options they have.  They're each served with a small appetizer paired to the drink.  My favorites come with the stuffed jalapeno or a spicy beef stick.  The downside is that this place is always packed AND they won't take reservations.  This costs them a star because we have driven out of our way to eat here only to be turned away by ridiculously long wait times."}
{"text":"It had been about 5 years since I last visited South Side and I can honestly report that absolutely nothing has changed. It's still the same old trendy Tremont neighborhood bar and grill that I remember and I'm not sure if this is a good thing. Our last visit was out of necessity; It was Labor Day we wanted lunch and pretty much every place in Cleveland that wasn't a chain was closed.  There's nothing really that memorable about South Side. They are essentially a local tavern with better than average bar food. As others have mentioned, I don't think they are sure what they wanna be when they grow up - are you a gastropub or a bar that serves food. On the one hand, they've got some nice decor with a great marble counter and some lovely reclaimed architecture.They've also got one of the best patios in Tremont. On the other hand, they've also got plastic cups (like cheap Solo plastic cups) and painfully slow and somewhat ambivalent service. It sort of reminds me of my college days back at Ohio University in the mid-90's. It was OK then but when I'm in a place that charges $11 for red pepper, artichoke and crab dip I expect a modicum of decorum, please.  Speaking of slow service, on our (probably last) visit we actually waited for nearly 25 minutes before receiving our order. The couple that sat next to us at the bar 10 minutes after we arrived was served first. I wasn't offered a beer/drink menu and the folks behind the bar seemed to be in way over their heads. Breaking glasses anyone?  The beer list is pretty mediocre. I think there were 8 taps or maybe 10. Anyway, it doesn't really matter. I'm used to being spoiled by beer selection and this didn't even come close. Two beers of note during our visit were Columbus IPA and Stone pale ale. If you're in Tremont and you want beer selection head over to the Tremont Tap House. Oh, and what's with serving beer in some kind of water glass? Maybe they reserve the pint glasses for special events. Ugh.  Our food was pretty good. My wife ordered the Caesar salad with salmon. First off, let me start by saying if you're charging $10.50 for a salad the least you could do is jazz it up a bit. This \"entree\" salad at South Side consisted of chopped romaine lettuce, dressing and a playing card deck sized piece of salmon. Did I mention it cost $10.50?! No croutons? No sliver of Parmesan cheese? The salmon was cooked well and seasoned nicely, but the whole thing was completely devoid of love from the kitchen. Definitely phoned in.  When I saw chicken and waffles on the menu I had to order it. For some reason, this one's listed under small plates, but I took a chance. After being totally wowed by this dish at Deagan's I had high expectations. They were not to be met. The Belgian-style waffle was crispy, and golden brown but rather than allow me to dose the syrup myself it was already soaked in the cinnamon concoction. The chicken breast still had the drumstick bone attached, which I thought was strange, but it was cooked well and the breading was crispy. I also dug the hot sauce. This dish wasn't bad, just OK. Was it worth $9.50? I don't think so.  I doubt we'll be coming back to South Side any time soon. I think they're overpriced and lost somewhere between being an adult restaurant and a 20-something hangout. They probably hold beer pong tournaments on the weekends. Oh well, who knows. Maybe in another five years when I've had time to forget about this experience just enough to want to give them another shot and everything else is closed I just might stop back in."}
{"text":"Good food. $2 miller lite and cheap Hamms during the Browns game. Lots of TVs. Service at the bar isn't always the best. I come up for games sometimes. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"After visiting South Side for the first time, I would have to say that my second experience is much better. I ordered the famous chicken and waffles with hot sauce and syrup on the side. The fried chicken was breaded perfectly and was the perfect crunch factor. The waffle on the other hand was the perfect sweetness and paired so well with the fried chicken. I am so happy that I decided to stop back!"}
{"text":"Again, I'm a sucker for a patio.  That's what drew me to this place initially, and I will certainly be back!  My buddy and I went for dinner and from start to finish, the food was incredible!  I actually ordered what I thought was a porterhouse STEAK, but it turns out they thought I meant the porterhouse PORK.  I decided to try it...mostly because it was my mistake for not fully reading the description (FYI, they do have both, so make sure you specify).  To my chagrin, I was pleasantly surprised!  Service was A-Plus too!  The service was great too.  Seemed like a very social atmosphere, one you could either have a date night, a couple buddies, or with a group of coworkers.  TV's at the inside bar had all the big games on too if that's your pleasure!  I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed by Southside! I hadn't been in a year or two and I think they've refreshed their menu. I had the quinoa and squash kale salad and it was delicious/full of flavor. My husband got the ultimate fried chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it. It was a bit loud (we sat in the side room with the fireplace) but we really enjoyed our dinner here."}
{"text":"I stopped by with a large group of people last Wednesday (8/7). To my surprise it was their 10th anniversary so everything was half off! They have a pretty extensive beer and food menu.  We start with ahi-tuna chips and mussels. The ahi-tuna was seared but mainly rare. It was fresh and the wasabi sauce made it an almost sashimi experience. The chips were deep fried wonton skins. The mussels were good, but the they weren't too big. The broth had good flavors with bits of chorizo.  For my main I order the pork tenderloins and my gf ordered the scallops. The tenderloins were not bad, but I think it would be better if the outside was seared. It was cooked nicely and was moist and tender inside. It was topped with bacon in a thick semi sweet rum sauce over a bed of rice. The bacon would have been better if it wasn't covered in the sauce. I think a bit of crispiness to this dish would add some texture. The scallops were pretty good, it's definitely the better dish of the two."}
{"text":"Southside is great anytime of the day. 1st time dining in after midnight. I got the brisket sliders and the chicken and waffles.  Sooooo good."}
{"text":"I would've given this place 5 stars since it's always my go to place to dine when I'm in Tremont, except last night. I ordered a burger with no bacon, waitress comes out with my meal and it had bacon I let her know instantly in a nice way of course, she goes back in the kitchen comes out a minute later and tells me it's been taken care of. I knew instantly that in the back they probably just slid the bacon out of my burger, which really upset me. I could've done that myself, but the grease of the bacon stays. I think this mistake wouldn't have happened if she wrote down my order. I tried to eat my burger but I just couldn't, bacon is something that I can't eat and it ruined my appetite. I would've complained, but I'm not a complainer like that. I just left my tip and acted super natural, I didn't want to bother the waitress anymore, but I hope that next time someone asks for no bacon don't just take it out and serve it knowing the grease is there ."}
{"text":"I always forget about The South Side. It's convenient to get to in Tremont, the menu has so many things that look delicious, and their indoor/outdoor dining area adds some great ambiance and a ton of seating so that they never seem too full for another table. The last time I went we made a reservation for 10 people just a few hours later in the evening, and they accommodated us exceptionally. But... my food just wasn't that good. I went on a limb ordering the falafel wrap, and ended up eating everything but the falafel (pita, hummus, turned the lettuce garnish into a few bites of salad) and was \"satisfied\" with my meal (minus the hard black balls of falafel left on my plate). The person across from me ordered the tacos I wished I had ordered, but they sent some food back on their plate too. My boyfriend got wings and liked those very much.. so maybe next time get wings?  I want to go back and try more of the things that looked so tasty on their menu, I just hope they taste as good as I hope they will when they make it to my table. Check it out yourself, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the South Side since it opened, and I love the place!  The space is beautiful. From funky bar indoors that is always a happening space, to the covered indoor/outdoor patio, to the best fair weather patio in Tremont, this place has it covered.   Service is always friendly. I lived down the street 7 years ago, and the manager still greets me on a first name basis every time I'm in town for work!  Food covers great sandwiches to ever-changing entrees. Their brunches are amazing, and their selection of bloody Mary's is something to behold. Value is better here than elsewhere in Tremont. This isn't just bar food!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants. The whole atmosphere is cozy with a very chill vibe. I also really loved the way the menu was organized. I started with the highly recommended lobster bisque and was not disappointed. I got the steak sandwich and my boyfriend got the peppercorn crusted bistro steak. The presentation of the steak was amazing and the taste was even better. My steak sandwich was the best I've ever tasted. Perfectly moist and flavorful. Awesome service. Awesome food. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Southside and I have hooked some of my friends as well. I have had almost everything on the menu and the only thing I have not liked is the duck pizza. I recommend the lobster bisque, *spicy chicken enchiladas*, calamari, cuban sandwich and more. Their daily specials usually sound delicious too. Also there is a good crowd and great decor."}
{"text":"What a great, hip eatery! I would definitely eat here again.  I was in town on business and some of local friends suggested we meet here.  I perused the menu and wasn't extremely drawn one way or another but gave it a try. Very impressed! I'm craving my meal right now.  I would describe the food as revisited chic comfort food.  While some of the dishes sound very plain and simple, each one I saw/sampled had a touch of class and creativity.  We started out with a gorgeous calamari appetizer with spice pan-fried julienne vegetables and a cilantro ailoli. It was sweet, spicy, crunchy and the calamari so tender. Very delicious!! I am a HUGE calamari fan but the breading has to be light and crispy for me to give it lots of stars and this dish won me over.  Loved the extra flavors and the tinge of heat as well! Great twist on a classic seafood appetizer.  I couldn't have been happier with my selection. I highly recommend the pork tenderloin roulade with mascarpone stuffing, pork bolognese, potato gnocchi and braised kale.  It was hearty and delicious! There was so much meat! This is a nice restaurant so I was expecting a high price tag ($17) and small plate, but I ended up taking most of it to go. Even the gnocchi was delicious and I'm usually not a fan of it. SO so good.   One of my friends opted for the chicken and waffle.  The breading was a little heavier than I would like, but that's what this dish is all about.  And she loved it! I'm guessing this southern classic isn't very common in Cleveland restaurants so it's nice to see it on the menu.  The combination of sweet and savory is always a winner.  I didn't sample any of the other dishes but everyone was happy.  Someone had a sale, another had a huge sandwich and another has pasta.  Tremont is an awesome little neighborhood and this is an awesome little eatery!"}
{"text":"Love the live music and the service I receive everytime I am there. Food is good but I haven't had a lot of the menu to make a full judgment.  CUTE bar!"}
{"text":"I took a trip to Cleveland for the weekend and on Sunday I decided to try this place out. It wasn't that busy besides the bar was packed for the World Cup match. We got there around 20 mins to 3. But we couldn't order from the lunch menu even though its was almost 3. So I got the Chicken and Waffles. Did not know there was gonna be a bone in it!   Service was slow for some reason. Not that many people were there. But tons of workers. Strange.   The chicken and waffles tasted fine. Except it was drentched in too sweet syrup. So much syrup that the waffle fell apart. Needless to say I ate it. Regretted it an hour or so later. I got sick from the food.   I'll never come back here again. Tremont Tap house was way better."}
{"text":"As someone who goes out to eat a lot and loves supporting locally owned businesses, this update hurts to put out there--but it needs to happen.   A piece a advice for South Side: Fire all your staff and start from scratch. If that's out of the question, then AT LEAST teach them customer service, would you? I've only been this disappointed in restaurant service maybe three other times in my life, so this is saying a lot coming from me, Miss Silver Lining.  Our experience went wrong on a few levels:   1) My Mother made a reservation for a party of 8 to celebrate my sister's birthday. They told her on the phone that we could get there anytime between 5:30 and 6, but they had our table reserved at 8pm. Therefore, we'd need to be done by then. Okay... So, our party shows up a little before 6pm and the smile-less, unfriendly hostess feels the need to tell my Mom that they almost gave her table away. If you call that customer service, then you suck so hardcore at life it hurts. Remove stick from butt, then come to work. Thanks. And if that's really the case, we'll gladly take our money to the plethora of other, BETTER restaurants in Cleveland. You're not going to hurt my feelings.   2) Who is this MMA-style, uber aggressive waiter you have serving tables on a Saturday night? He was in shorts, an Ed Hardy-ish t-shirt ,Vans sneakers and I wasn't sure if he *really* wanted to know if I was done with my plate or if he was going to punch me in the face. Either way, his tone sounded like the latter. Maybe he was just 'roid-rage screaming at us because the music was loud enough to cause temporary deafness. On top of that, he brought us check and didn't even think to ask if we wanted it split up. An 8 person party and that thought doesn't even cross your mind? I had to track him down, ask him, receive his massive eye-roll and attitude, then watch him storm back to our table while strong-arming chairs along the way.   3) Plastic water cups? Are you a dive or a nice gastro-pub? Pick one, please--then adjust your menu prices accordingly.   4) I don't care if you're hosting the entire Running With The Santas after-party. How about you take the time to give two shits about your regular, dine-in customers? Is that too much to ask?   I really have no desire to spend my money here and I honestly hope the owner reads this review, takes it as constructive criticism and does something about his staff."}
{"text":"Poor food: everything on the menu sounds good, but relax, it's not. And surprisingly only two vegetarian options; while myself nor my party is vege, I was surprised to see only two vege options. In my party of four, we all tried each other's food and we could all agree that the food was definitely below mediocre and very incredibly underseasoned and/or completely tasteless. No chorizo could be found in the breakfast burrito nor does their hollandaise sauce taste like anything.  Moderate beer selection: just normal stuff that you can find virtually anywhere. Being a huge beer guy though, I have high expectations when it comes to this and Cleveland being considered among the best beer cities in the country, The Southside does a poor job showcasing this.  Decent mixed drinks: a mimosa and two different bloodies were had in my party, again all shared. The mimosa was just meh. The bacon bloody was mediocre. The cucumber bloody was by far the best and, to my experience, among some of the better bloodies I've ever consumed.  Poor service: Our server only came to check on us once while being there for at least an hour and the place had many many empty tables and plenty of other servers checking on the other tables. We actually needed to ask another server to get us some sriracha since our server was not around when the food came nor awhile after. I don't know if he's a naturally curt guy, felt rushed or what, but he certainly wasn't the best part of the place by any stretch. Cheer up man.   The bottom line: Overall, while the location is appealing, there are far more restaurants that serve vastly better food with more attentive servers, better beer selection and far better mixed drinks. Some mild to moderate changes could make this a 4-star place at least."}
{"text":"I try not to write something based on one visit. So with that being said, I have visited The South Side over a dozen times over the past  few years. the place is a nice cozy neighborhood restaurant and bar. They have a nice selection of beers, wines by the glass, and specialty cocktails. They also have a good selection of appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees ( entrees served from 5:00 pm to Midnight). The food in general always looks nice and taste good  at decent  prices.  On my past visit, I waited over 20 minutes before anyone came over for any service (I just happened to look at my watch when I sat down till the time someone came over) I was sitting on the patio on a nice day with a good friend, so it did not bother me so much. On this visit my friend and I shared the Sesame-crusted yellow fin Tuna seared rare (very good),  and the Chicken and Waffles which is usually one of my favorites, but on this day it was a little disappointing, the chicken portion was  on the small side and, was overly  battered and a bit on the greasy side, but in general sill ok. We also had the a Grouper sandwich which was outstanding with a side of onion rings that could have been outstanding too, if they were a fried a bit more crispy, hot and a little less greasy. I can say I have had a good amount of the menu and would say everything I have had has been pretty good often looking better than what it taste like, but still being good enough to return. Service is usually average and better than  average if you are at the bar. In my opinion I'd  say The South Side is good place to come for patio dining or a late night meal (they serve food till midnight)."}
{"text":"Decent bar/restaurant, I had a Columbus IPA, side of French onion soup, Tremont Burger+chips.  The soup was really good, think my buddy liked his Bison chili as well. The beer pours were eh, a little half assed. The burger was big, plenty of toppings, but not seasoned. Chips were ok. Prices overall were about right. Service was also just ok, very nice but just slow.   Everything was ok, nothing a 'wow' but I'd go back  and could be a nice place to gather and drink, have some food with a group."}
{"text":"Delish!    I took a friend to The South Side for a late lunch and it was really quite good!! We started off with Bloody Mary's which were absolutely fantastic!!!!! We sat by a window that looked over the street and the sum streaming in illuminated the inside and you could get a better sense of the rustic inside and bonus? We noticed we were surrounded by many other beautiful people!!!( lLOL!!!) No but seriously...My friend ordered eggs, toast, bacon, gravy and was VERY well received...I had buttermilk blueberry pancakes with blueberry sauce and REAL blueberry's!!!!!!   Not a shocker but not so far away another cafe that is suppose to be good served up this synthetic blueberry concoction that was just awful!!!!  But I digress...So yes we had Bloody Mary's that were fantastic! Yes our entrees were delicious!!! And lastly our server was spot on!  Go ahead...Take my word for it...Or don't...We are all sentient beings and certainly capable of making our own decisions!!!! Right?"}
{"text":"They deserve this update, and an upgrade to 4 Stars!  Though the hostess still needs to learn how to say hello (and how to smile) - their services is much better than before.   We've spent two holidays at SS in the past few months, and they've handled our large parties very well.  I must say, I was nervous about them holdling to our reservation on New Years Eve - a problem they've had in the past - and we were happy to walk in and see our table!  Second Annual President's Day Celebration at SS was a blast! Our server was a very kind - and even jumped in for some presidential trivia.  I was never looking around asking \"Where is my drink?\" - and found him asking me ... \"Getting a little low miss, ready for another?\"  My answer was always, \"Yes!\"   To recap - food still amazing, and service making very positive strides!"}
{"text":"When you walk in to the South Side you instantly feel invited, between the staff, decor, and lit indoor/outdoor fireplace. My family and I went for my dad's birthday (fyi they don't do anything to celebrate birthdays). We were there during happy hour, so we got the happy hour wine, the buffalo and the mushroom flatbread. We didn't realize that those could have been a meal in themselves. Most of the table ordered the burgers which they were all please with. I ordered the Mac and cheese and everyone I was sitting with tried and loved it, along with myself. I really enjoyed this restaurant and I know if I go during happy hour I could leave with a pretty cheap bill."}
{"text":"I have gone twice now and I think this place is great. I have sat inside with the fireplace which was nice for a date, and I have sat outside on the patio during the summer. I have had...  Grilled Salmon Spicy Banana Peppers Chicken and Waffles  All very good and cannot wait to try more! Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Now I loved this place when I lived in Cleveland... loved it when it was even the Hi and Dry back in the day... cannot say that I love it as much anymore.  After being there this past Saturday night, I must say, I was kind of disappointed.  Who does not hate seeing a place that they once loved go down the pooper?  The service was meh, the one hostess was about as rude as a person could possibly be, and the general vibe in the place seemed so somber.  What happened to the place that I once loved to go almost every Friday for happy hour and spent many a Saturday evenings enjoying myself with friends?  My guess is that many people have moved their business elsewhere if their experience was as icky as mine this time around.    Still love the way the place looks... and the food was always great, but service and attitude can make a huge difference and it certainly did here!"}
{"text":"The Blackened Grouper Sandwich is incredible! Even so it is a hard choice between that and the Chicken & Waffles.  Also love their fries, fresh cut and delicious."}
{"text":"Walked in around 4 with empty tables everywhere. They told us it would be 30-40 minutes because there was reservations ahead of us. We waited for an hour and a half, still empty tables, still not seated. I'm hangry."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... Truly did. The first time I came here for brunch I made excuses for the fact that half the items in my dish were missing and my server was at-least kind enough  (even though begrudging) to get me a small side of fruit to make up for it.   However it seems like this joint is hell bent on being its own worst enemy by hiring incompetent staff that will eventually drive all customers away.   I came here again this time for happy hour with a friend. Despite there probably being a handful of people at the restaurant we waited about 10 mins at the door before the hostess appeared and seated us- No apology offered for the wait.   Once seated, we decided to order from the happy hour menu which had $5 appetizers. We decided to go with the hummus and pita, pork sliders and chili corn Queso. You would think our meal would not take much time to get from the kitchen to our table given 2 of our 3 orders should have been already prepared (hummus and corn queso) right?....WRONG!   After close to an hour of waiting, contemplation to leave and desperate attempts to track our server, our food arrived. Only explanation offered for the delay...they were short staffed. I would have been more tolerant if they were busy...there were 4 other occupied tables and all of them already were eating by the time we were seated!  Not once was any apology given...nor were we offered any compensation for the inconvenience which one expects of restaurants of this caliber. The vibe conveyed by the staff is almost too causal with little regard to the patrons discomfort.  To compliment the shabby service the food was nothing to write home about. The hummus had a bitter after taste, the pork sliders were OK. The Chilli Corn queso was the saving grace of this deplorable service. It had the perfect flavors- spicy, creamy...totally flavorful.   Overall: This place isn't worth the time and money unless you are doing the $5 happy hour and don't mind long waits and careless staff. Maybe the management should invest some time and effort to train their staff given they are in the hospitality business."}
{"text":"We have been here three times and neither time was eventful.  The last visit was HORRIBLE.  The place was not that busy, we sat at the bar.  There were several bar seats available.  Anyways, we sat for 10 minutes with only the hostess asking if we wanted a table.  Meanwhile the bartenders (3 of them) were busy serving and talking to customers at the other side of the bar.  Yet a lady came in after we were there  several minutes and got served.  After they served her they went back to the other side of the bar like we were invisible.... we will NEVER come back to this establishment again...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Cleveland. The enchiladas and eggs and their open face grilled cheese are amazing."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing wowed me. Has a bit more character than most Cleveland restaurants"}
{"text":"mobile review I've been to South side twice now and both experiences have been lackluster to say the least. The main reason that the experience on both occasion has been so lackluster is as a result of the apathetic and absentee servers. If you have the misfortune of being in the attached dining area be sure you have your flare gun handy because this will be the only hope you have of attracting the attention of your server. There are handfuls of great restaurants in the Tremont Ohio city area... I can't wait for South Side to close so there will be another pleasant addition. Unless you plan to sit at the bar and eat do yourself a favor and find a different venue. A word of advice to the mediocre service staff... If you hate your job so much go work at Aldi's or Marc's you'll fit right in ;)."}
{"text":"big fan of this palce and come here a little too often.  The hummus is great as an app.  I've eaten here many times and never had a bad meal.  The staff is awesome and offer great suggestions.  This is also always one of the first coupons to sell out on restaurant.com for a reason.  The patio is awesome and always a great happy hour crowd."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I ate here twice last week and could easily go back again. My new favorite thing on the menu is the grilled romaine salad, although you can't go wrong with anything. They've got a nice patio as well as a nice inside/ outside porch. This is a great casual restaurant that's good for lunch and dinner. I've also been wanting to try their brunch which I've heard is great (and not sure how it couldn't be)."}
{"text":"Yes the chicken and waffles were really good. But everything else (Tremont Burger, buffalo potato skins, broc cheddar soup, pulled pork, fries) was pretty basic or less than. Burger bun was burnt not toasted, fries were over cooked, tater skins were nothing I couldn't have got at a corner bar. Soup had no real flavors going for it.   Seems like it'd be a great for drinks though."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre but the terrible service is why I will never dine here again. After being seated we waited nearly 20 minutes before our server approached our table. We ordered bottled beers--their beer selection is good, I will give them that. A few minutes, I noticed a large fly floating in my glass. I brought this attention to the server who balked \"You better not expect another beer for free! Either you drink it with the fly or you buy another beer.\" Who says something like that? How about your dirty establishment not have a fly problem in the first place? I ended up buying the second beer and regret it. Never again."}
{"text":"Get their lobster bisque. Get a drink. Expect a good time, but don't expect good service. A bar with acceptable tasting seafood dishes?! WHAT! I love South Side! Came here for the first time after many recommendations and it didn't fail my expectations.  I love the atmosphere of this place, it's a nice chill clean bar. And on top of that, they've got great food. Definitely get their lobster bisque!   One thing though... service seems to be fairly slow for a bar."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. We didn't have to wait very long we walked right in for brunch on a Sunday. I had the chicken and waffles with the cinnamon butter and it was amazing!! The beer selection was great the atmosphere was great. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot"}
{"text":"Good food.  Great music.   Late night food.   Great crowd. I have only had some apps but the were good. The stuffed peppers could have  had a bit more meat.  The potato skins were good  Its kind of hard to mess those up.They were not greasy!  Crowded but easy to get a drink. Really good people that work here!  Fun times as the South Side."}
{"text":"I just keep coming back to this place! My girlfriend absolutely loves this place.  The night scene here is really fun with an upbeat mixed age crowd.   The place has an indoor and outdoor patio, but the parking area is ghetto lol.  The food is mediocre, but there is one thing on the menu that appeals to me and my group of friends. The Chilean Sea Bass on a bed of lobster risotto. Amazinggg, but its only seasonal. Theres even a vegetarian menu for all you non meat eaters.  All in all great place to stop in for good food, good times, and a great chilled out night."}
{"text":"I got the shrimp & grits with andouille sausage, the shrimp & grits were really good, I prefer when the andouille is broken up in the grits and sauce"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. It is probably our favorite bar food spot in Cleveland. They have a great selection of beer and cocktails and are very reasonably priced. Foodwise, they have the best wings, chicken sandwich, & burger. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We started the night with the hummus for an appetizer and my boyfriend got a shipyard smashing pumpkin and I got a wyders raspberry cider.  The pumpkin beer was dangerously good but came in a smaller glass.  The raspberry was a light and delightful taste of fresh fruit.  I was pretty happy with both as they came quickly after we ordered.  The appetizer of hummus was good as well.  I especially liked the topping on the hummus.  The entrees were just OK.  I had the top sirloin over white rice as well as a tomato spring salad.  The salad was really good with a great variety of grape/cherry tomatoes in many colors.  There was a little bit too much sauce but overall that was very good.  I felt like my steak was cooked very well-medium rare but it didn't have that much seasoning on it.  My boyfriend had a pulled pork sandwich that came in a pita with fries.  The fries were absolutely amazing the pulled pork looked messy but good.  Overall I would come back to this place maybe for a late night drink.    The parking lot is across the street and is a bit shady but  I would say a solid 4 for this establishment."}
{"text":"If I'm in Tremont, I always stop here for lunch/dinner. I like the atmosphere & the service has always been good. The chicken wings are really good but the real start of the show is the chicken & waffle. The waffle is cooked perfectly (light & crunchy) which goes good with the flavorful chicken."}
{"text":"Good food. Meh service. We waited 15+ minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress. It's not really her fault. The place seems understaffed and she was nice enough. The hostess was not quite as friendly and had a little too much attitude for the position she holds. The drinks were decent. The flatbread I had was awesome."}
{"text":"Went to The Loop with a friend. We got hungry and stumbled across The South Side.  We sat outside -- I really liked how the patio was semi-private in that the trees blocked the street view. The way the patio was lit at night really set a comfortable mood.  My friend and I split the eggplant appetizer, got our own salads, then split the salmon burger.   First off -- wow,the eggplant appetizer was amazing. I definitely recommend it as a starter. It, perhaps, had too much sauce and too little goat cheese, but it was very well cooked and the flavors really burst out.  The salad was standard fare - what wasn't standard were the dressings! Try their wasabi-cucumber dressing. It wasn't too hot and really added an interesting flavor for the salad (and the sandwich which I put the leftovers of my dressing on the salmon!).  As for the salmon, it was perfectly cooked. I really enjoyed that sandwich and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"After our shelter outing we were hungry so we decided to head to the Southside! For starters, this place is pretty awesome. The nice thing is they have a parking lot across the street so you can almost always find parking.  The restaurant itself is your typical, restaurant. It's very very loud. I'm not sure if they do that on purpose or what. Plus, the music they play is terrible. Lol! My husband and I were sitting at the bar and were barely able to hear each other.  However, with that being said. The food is spectacular and the drinks are yummy!! I ordered the chicken fried steak and a mimosa, plus an Irish coffee. I know, I know.  Everything came out quickly and the bar tenders were wicked awesome.  We've been here a few times. There's always a super long wait. I guess it is what it is. Other than the music being way to loud and pretty awful. The atmosphere is comfortable and the staff is great. The food is totally worth listening to the Backstreet boys! We'll be back, we always come back."}
{"text":"Went with a decent sized group late on a Friday night and was very nicely accommodated. I had trouble deciding, and the waitress recommended the blackened grouper sandwich. I ordered it out of blind faith and was pleasantly surprised! The fish was generously portioned and perfectly cooked (nice and tender), the ciabatta bread was soft but made for a sturdy sandwich with a ton of flavor. I got the fries with gravy, cheese and bacon along with it and was in heaven. Excited to try more off of their menu."}
{"text":"I give 4 stars when a place is good.  I give 5 when I'm overly impressed.    Outside patio is nice.  Server girl was fine, got the job done with no complaints from me.  Food lowdown:  Veggie egg rolls app- seem fresh.  Super Stuffed with veggies. Comes with a mango purée/soy sauce combo. I just kinda liked them, my hubby and 14 yr. old son liked them more.    Mac & cheese with breaded chix added- excellent!  Yum!  Turkey sandwich with bacon and Swiss & side of sun dried aioli (I think that's what it was)- excellent!  A ton if turkey on it!  I actually took a bunch off and took it home to make another sandwich out of it.  Really nice taste... Good turkey.  Ribeye  w/rosemary potatoes and asparagus - very good.    Unsweetened ice tea is good.  They have a menu of specialty cocktails and martins- I didn't have any this time, but have already picked out a few I want to try next time!    Ps.  A crying kid was here. Ruins the atmosphere.  It's not the type of place I would bring a kid..."}
{"text":"We were staying in Tremont (from California) and found this place from searching online. It was within walking distance from the place we were staying at. The service was quick and the food was delicious. I got the calamari - best I've ever had! Split the steak sandwich. Got the chocolate cake but wasn't too excited about it. Overall great food and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ah southside, we go way back. I fell in love with their Chicken and Waffles. Never had this amazing lip-smacking combo before I dined here, so I never knew what a delicious morsel it would be! The waffle is simply orgasmic. It's buttery, crispy, sweet and golden all over. Then it's topped with a crunchy piece of fried chicken and some maple syrup & a side of hot sauce. What a flavor bust- sweet, butter, salty, crunchy, spicy all in one!   All the other foods are good too, but not as mind blowing. Good beer selection and decent service make this a great place to dine with friends. It can get a little loud in there, so it's hard to have conversation. Otherwise, go for it."}
{"text":"Use to be decent, past tense..went to watch the Cavs game & ordered a flat bread. Basically my 10 year old has created the same exact dish using Lunchables from the local grocer. Either my 10 year old is a gourmet chef genius, or this restaurant decided to smoke a joint, throw together a Lunchables pizza & serve it to us. Nice try Southside..for I have also smoked one & created such a \"flat bread\" in my younger years. I also got to play musical chairs while trying to score a seat where I wouldn't be frost bitten...like the Vespa scene from Dumber & Dumber. I decided to throw in another star because the lobster bisque was decent & our waitress was sweet & a total babe."}
{"text":"Worst ever.  When i call and say there's a birthday party for 6 and you refuse a reservation for 8 saying \"we're exceptional at moving tables,\" and we cab over to Tremont that day from Beachwood only for you to have an 1 1/2 hour wait, and do nothing to accommodate the party even though we tried to reserve - then you are an asshole of a restaurant. Well done. And here I was trying to give you a chance at winning the business even though I met an admitted coke whore at the Flying Monkey who said she cooked for you.  A huge waste of a person that makes food there.  Slum."}
{"text":"I have been dining @ Southside for awhile and feel the food is hit or miss especially brunch. The place is always packed and I can see why. The ambulance and location is great. There is both indoor and outdoor seating which is a plus. The wait staff, especially Angie, are attentive and friendly. The crowd is always fun and there is just an overall great vibe. The drinks are for the most part creative and tasty. On a recent Sunday Brunch experience I was disappointed. After waiting for 15 minutes after being seated, we had not been approached by a server. I got up and politely asked if they knew we were there. I was told the hostesses were new and hadn't alerted a server. No problem. I truly do love the place and had friends with me who have never been. I wanted it to be a great experience. We placed our order and waited again an unusual amount of time. Our food arrived...one standard breakfast (bacon, eggs, toast), a breakfast enchilada and chicken and waffles. My chicken and waffles was not what I'm used to. Kind of a lifeless waffle with an overcooked chicken breast. The menu says Ohio syrup. This is not served with real maple syrup. Cmon guys?? Charge an extra dollar so you can put the real stuff on an otherwise great entree. This is Tremont. People come for quality food. My friends enchilada was cold. Of course, he's too nice to return. Anyway I'm writing this review because I love this place. I want the standard I expect to return!! I will try again and hope I leave happy!!"}
{"text":"Had a friend that SWORE by their blackened grouper sandwich. Service was fine, but the sandwich was sooo salty I couldn't eat more than two bites. Very disappointing:( When I called and told a manager, I was offered to have it replaced. Haven't had a chance to go back yet.....so unfortunately, until I do, 2 stars."}
{"text":"Two stars: \"Meh, Ive experience better\" is definitely the most appropriate rating for this place. The menu is very interesting and varied, and I would have liked to have gone back and tried some more, but after my first experience, I wont be back.   With the Cleveland restaurant scene as varied and vibrant as it is, I have no patience with poor service. 1. We werent greeted at the door and had to go wandering around looking for someone. 2. The waitress felt she didnt need to write our orders down - and guess what - she got two of the four orders wrong. 3. The guy who brought the food expected us to clear the table for him. Really? Thats your job buddy. 4. We sort of waited to see if our waitress would come back so we could get our order straightened out, but she was absent long enough that we just ate what we were given and considered ourselves lucky.   Too bad. As I said the menu was very interesting to us and the food wasnt bad, but we wont be going back. The food just wasnt special enough. I think young locals will get a kick out of the ambiance and variety of food, but its not worth it if you are any further away than walking distance. Trust me, there is someplace better in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"Got a call from some friends asking me to meet them in Tremont for dinner. Immediately when I heard the words \"Tremont\" and \"dinner\" I prepared myself for a underwhelming and overpriced meal as I had gotten three times prior before swearing to never visit the area again. BUT they insisted that this \"Southside\" place was the place to eat there. So I read the reviews and was SHOCKED to hear that the food was of poor quality and overpriced *gasp* Better warn my friends... and of course they wanted to go anyway so away we went craving beer and dinner.  The service was shockingly average. Yes it was a little on the slow side for the limited crowd. I can see the service aspect of this place devolving into a giant mess if a crowd hit on a weekend. Most of the problem stems from cramped and limited seating in a no frills bar building. Which is made even more limited when the frequent bad weather in Cleveland makes outdoor seating unrealistic.    The food was slightly worse than something I would expect from TGI Fridays. Left me with a queasy feeling even while I write this. I felt that it was wayyyyy WAYYYY overpriced for what they put on your plate as previous reviews had mentioned. I guess you are just paying extra for that grungy hipster college vibe they try to portray? Not sure.  The cumulative problems generated a few complaints from my friends.BUT they get no sympathy points because fair warning was given as any good Yelper would do.  Well what more can I say about this place really? I went in with major concerns and got what I expected. I can at least thank others for warning me to brace myself for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland to see the Packers play the Browns and a friend brought us here...    Staff was great, especially Rebecca who took fantastic care of us.   We started off with Bloody Marys of course... I had the bacon bloody and it was great.   I also had the chicken and waffles and thought it was outstanding.  Very unique how the put a boneless breast with a wing and deep fried them together... Really cool.   Can't wait to come back again and try something new.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Good food great service. What else is there to say? We will for sure be taking another trip back here. It was very reasonably priced for the area as well!"}
{"text":"I have to throw some things out here right away. My personal food and service were both great. What my friend and I witnessed was very disappointing and leads to the two star evaluation.   A group of 4 people had been waiting for a patio table for over an hour after the host or hostess told them it would be a 30 minute wait. My friend and I had seen them sit many other people outside in the time we were there even before the guests started complaining and asking questions. It was OBVIOUS that they had forgotten about the group or there was some sort of mix up. They weren't able to fix the issue and from what I could hear even lied to the guests multiple times saying they were getting a table ready for them right then. After another 10 minutes, the guests ended up leaving noticeably upset. Here is where they really dropped the ball. Right at the hosting podium, surrounded by other customers that had just seen this whole event unfold, the manager (woman with a butterfly tattoo on her upper back) the tall male host with short blond hair, and the brunette host had a 4 minute laughing party about the guests. It's bad enough that the hosts were doing it, but the manager? That's what you think about your guests? It was disgusting. As the one patron said as he walked out \"it's just bad management\".   Anyway, as I said my food and service were great. Antigone was out waitress and she was very attentive. I ordered the wings and a small salad. The wings were large, crispy on the outside and extra juicy on the inside. Pretty much perfect in my opinion. They brought them out on a basic white plate which for being in tremont I thought was strange but I could honesty care less. The salad was very fresh  but smaller than I was expecting. I guess that should be expected when you order a \"small\" .   My personal experience with south side would be a 4 star (I had some disappointing food another time) but after my experience tonight I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I drove in from Rochester MI to have dinner with friends flying in from Denver. They picked the place as they had dinner here about three years ago. I had to sit at the bar as I was way early. The bartender took time with me to pick a beer, typed the WiFi password in my netbook. She was friendly even though super busy. I has pork sliders at the bar that were only $5. They would cost twice that where I live. They were generous and delicious with fresh slaw, and had what seemed to be Tony Packo hot sweet pickles on top on a skewer. Easily a meal's worth. When my friends came they asked to be moved from the first table and were accommodated with no attitude at all. I treated them and the whole bill was $58 for food. I expect to pay near that for two not four. My Blackened Grouper sandwich seemed to be real honest to God Grouper, and I got about three times as much fish as I expected. The grits were so-so. Any restaurant has bad days and off experiences - but I can't see some of the crappy reviews people left for this place. We were there on a Thur. so maybe it's too busy on weekends to keep up. I'll be back and bring my wife in a couple months because she wants to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nearby."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for Xmas eve. I have been here before and it's a great place to grab a drink. But this is the first time I have been here for food. The food here is average at best. The portions are very tiny. The fact we had to get pizza after dinner is all I need to say. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was a little dry but the waffle was very good. Are server wasn't very friendly at all. She did her job ok, but with no enthusiasm what so ever."}
{"text":"The service was excellent . . . sorry didn't catch the waitress name but she was very friendly and helpful.  The food came out quickly and was hot and delicious.  The coffee and water kept coming.  We had a cup of the chili and a cup of the lobster soup.  The chili is spicy but really good!  We both had the chicken and waffles.  HUGE.  Everytime I go to South Side, I promise myself to order something different but still the chicken and waffles call my name!    The only bad thing is the parking and South Side's lot across the street needs to have another load of gravel dumped into the holes.  We could have lost our car in the one and it was filled with water so we didn't know how deep it went."}
{"text":"Pros: The atmosphere was cool; the food was good; and there was parking.  Cons: The hostess and the waiter. :(  They were fairly busy when my friend and I got there for lunch, but it took the host a really long time to show up.  She did quickly seat us...but right by the door.  It was freezing out and every time the door opened it was frickin cold!  The waiter came by right away and he was super enthusiastic.  We ordered food (which were great), and then the waiter never came back.  We wanted to order beers, but the waiter didn't come back so my friend went looking for him.  Haha.  He was nice about it, but then didn't come back (we'd probably have ordered another round).  The food was great."}
{"text":"First time! Had lunch..great atmosphere, food was great, had the grouper sandwich, great location and grear service!"}
{"text":"8 years ago I fell in love with South Side. Back then the menu was 1 page but I still kept on coming back for more. BEST TUNA IN TOWN. Then I moved to Chicago but I still would be in the CLE area at least 4 times a year. I always made sure to visit South Side. 4 years ago I got my purse stolen so I didnt have a driver's license, therefore I traveled with my passport.  The peachy part was that my passport happened to be anything but American. Well the bartender refused to serve me and said that they dont take passports as a form of ID. She gave me this story how the CLE police deprtment instructed them that passports shouldnt be used in bars. Sounded like BS. I was infuriated. I bartend for a living. A passport is the lamborgini of IDs. After a smartass comment that sounded like: \"Really, foreigners are not allowed to drink in your bar?\" The bartender retracted and goes well that's the OH law, but you look old enough so I will serve you, just make sure to have your license with you next time. Well, by then my thirst had gone away and my hate for SS knew no bounds. So I left and visited my other beloved joint \"the treehouse\".   After a lot of requests from my friends, last year I decided to give the place a break and came back. The menu was on steroids and the mean bartender was no longer there. I still like the place. They have good food and a great partio. The staff I have encountered these past few times has been great too but I still have hard feelings about this place so I tend to think twice about visiting them."}
{"text":"Tried this place on more than one occasion and at different times and days. - Overrated - Poor Service - Slow Service - Meal never consistent. I gave up!"}
{"text":"Maybe I have low expectations.. or maybe I just don't have my too cool for life hipster badge. Either way, I rather like South Side. I've only been there twice (both for lunch); first as the guest of a vendor and this past time meeting  friend, but the place is fine by me!   Service can be slow, but always friendly. The food is quite yummy;  they have duck on the menu so that makes me easy to please. I can recommend both the duck and goat cheese salad and the bbq duck pizza. I love that their flatbread pizzas are actually personal sized and you can order one without feeling like you need three extra people to share. My food has always been fresh and delicious.   I can't speak to the evening crowd, but lunch isn't that loud. They do lose a star for very limited seating if weather doesn't permit use of the outdoor patio. We got there at 12:15 and they said a table would be available at 1pm. We sat at the bar instead; which can be tricky with a 9 month pregnant woman, but we managed. She was able to live vicariously as the alcoholic beverages went by (I wouldn't be surprised if she had a post-labor margarita!)."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Cleveland, best Blood Marys in Cleveland, one of the best patios in Tremont. You have to go back so you can try everything on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that there are vegan and vegetarian options. The menu is always changing, but if the cauliflower steak is on the menu I highly recommend it. The room with the 2-way fire place is nice to sit in."}
{"text":"I had a totally A-OK experience at The South Side. It has a great location in Tremont with a free parking lot across the street and the staff and patrons are always friendly. It's a cool neighborhood stop.  My friend and I adventured in for lunch during a late afternoon. It was pretty empty because of the off-time, and we thought we'd be in and out, but the service was sadly very slow. We only had about 1hr for lunch as it was a workday, and we just felt really rushed. I had the turkey burger. It was everything I expected and nothing out of the ordinary, but the portion was generous and the ingredients were fresh.   I'm going to come back soon but I think it will be for happy hour. They have an awesome beer, cocktail and spirits selection. I imagine its a cool place with a great ambiance at night to have a drink, talk and relax. As others stated, excellent people watching through the big windows and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Great food.  On my block.  Most servers are cool.  Patrons though are mostly suburbanite, arrogant d bags.  I still try to go on non peak hrs to get my Blatz and Lobster Bisque fix!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for dinner a drink - whatever. Vibe is cool, but welcoming, people are friendly, patio is awesome for summer nights."}
{"text":"Terrible, rude service. We were in a large group so of course \"20% gratuity added automatically.\" The server, Josh, clearly knew this and took advantage of it. Beyond what you would normally expect from slow service, we had to sit there for 45 minutes from the time everyone finished eating to the time our bills were paid and we could finally leave. And that required forcibly getting his attention to tell him we were waiting, despite the fact that he visited a recently sat table nearby at least 4-5 times during our \"rest period\" without so much as glancing in our direction. Josh is a d*ck and ruined this place for 9 people who won't be coming back. What about the food? I can't even remember it so must not have been anything special."}
{"text":"I went on 4th of July because it was the only place open in Tremont. Which I was really excited because I've heard good things about this place. I understand that they were super busy because they were the only place open, but my waitress was super rude to us. She kept having an attitude with my group and kept ignoring us when we wanted to place an order. Also, their food was way over priced and it came out cold."}
{"text":"Food: 5 stars, service: 1 star.   We head in, about 6pm on a Saturday. The bar and the inside are packed, we're looking for a patio seat. We give the hostess our names and she quotes us 45 minutes for the patio, and tell her we are going to grab some drinks.  No drink prices on the menu. While checking out the menu, I ask a girl what the price of a drink is. She tells me she's 18 so doesn't know, ask another server or the bartender. So I ask a server. He tells me he also doesn't know, ask the bartender. I ask the bartender, she doesn't know and has to check their POS. Rinse and repeat for 2 drinks. No one seems to know the pricing. If your wait staff doesn't know, just put it on the menu. Why the guessing game?   No seats at the bar so we head outside to at least enjoy the weather. To our surprise there are 8-9 open tables on the patio. Why a 45 minute wait??? We pick a table and sit down. The hostess comes out and tells us we can sit there, but they are \"catching up on the tables inside so can't wait on us\" - you have empty tables on a Saturday night. Why not just have enough wait staff to accommodate? It is Saturday after all. You are a restaurant in one of the busiest, trendiest restaurant districts in the city. Get it together.   We finish our drinks. ~15 minutes later, a different hostess comes out and asks us if we need a server. We tell her yes. She hands us menus. We wait another ~20 minutes, no one has seen us and she comes out to seat another table. \"Has your waitress seen you yet?\" \"No, we don't even have waters.\"  She sends out the managers. We place our order. I ask if we can at least have a drink comped. Sure. She walks away, forgetting to ask what we were drinking; comes back out a couple minutes later to ask.   The food was delicious. It'll keep me coming back, and I'm sure that is the one and only saving grace of this restaurant and why it's still around."}
{"text":"I've been here  a few times and it continues to be a favorite in the Tremont area. Service can be a bit slow, even when they are not busy, but overall my experience has been a good one. Consistently good food and good beer selections. In my opinion, the best thing on their menu is the Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"They no longer serve the stuffed peppers, and they changed their menu. We ordered wings and they were not good.  The spicy margarita was pretty good though if you just want to stop on for a drink i recommend that, but not the fo"}
{"text":"We had the crispy calamari and it was incredible! My entree was the turkey burger and side salad - again, fantastic food! Service was a little iffy but what else is to be expected on a Friday night? We sat outside and it was a little loud but it mainly was the screeching females. ?"}
{"text":"I hosted a bachelorette party here and the staff was incredibly helpful as I tried to put together a group of girls last minute.  They were incredibly respectful of the task at hand and went above and beyond in serving us.  This is a great place for groups and the food was excellent.  I LOVED their calamari! I've also visited for Sunday brunch.  Great job!"}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland over the holidays, I met a friend at South Side for lunch.  My brother and his fiancé, who are Cleveland natives, love eating at South Side, so I knew the food would be good.  We waited for about ten minutes for a table even though we came in for lunch around 1:30pm on a Monday.  The table we ended up being seated at was right behind the hostess stand just beyond the door.  The dining room area looked pretty empty, so I'm not sure why they wanted us to catch pneumonia with how cold it was.  After being seated, we were trying to decide on a beer, but there was not draft menu.  We told the server we were still deciding, but he was nowhere to be found to actually order a drink after we placed our food order.  I had to ask another server to send him over. While he was apologetic and pleasant, we didn't get our beers until half way into eating our lunch.  My friend and I both ordered the grouper sandwich.  It was fantastic.  The fries that I ordered on the side were also amazing.    I am a huge fan of the food here.  I will say though that if I wasn't such a fan of the food, I would have given one less star due to the service."}
{"text":"We came from out of town for an event.  I found this on IG, and decided to try it.  I've been on a diet for 8 weeks and was so excited to finally splurge! I got the brisket tacos as recommended by the waitress. She also suggested I can mix and match tacos so I added one tofu chorizo last minute. The tacos were big in size and you get 3 for $10.  Tofu one was gross! The brisket ones were ok but not even as good as Chipotle...There were a lot of meat so they are not skimpy on that...but no flavor:( and some weird green veggies on top with mash potatoes on the bottom.  Being on diet for so long, anything would have tasted delicious but I was left disappointed.  I probably would not come back. Waitress and staff were great...and it was cool decor and several tvs if you want to grab a beer and watch football."}
{"text":"When one of the chef's at Momocho raves about the bloody Mary brunch at a place, you listen....and then you hustle your butt over there ASAP.  And so we did.  Yep, Damon was right on the money.  We were seated right by the fireplace that was nestled on a window wall overlooking the snow-gilded patio.  Just beautiful....and toasty warm, too.  Flat screens festooned the walls to keep track of pre-superbowl hype.  Quite nice.  Okay, enough about that stuff...now on the the reason we were there!  There was a nice list of bloodys, from those made with regular vodka, to citrus vodka, to those even made with Dogfish Ale.  What to pick, what to pick.  So we each (there were three of us) chose a different one and sampled all around.  I wish I could remember the names, but mine was garnished with bleu cheese stuffed olives and was piquant, spicy and definitely had undertones of dill pickles.  Yummy.  Another was similar, but made with citrus vodka and was nicely sweet and spicy...very different and was a contender for the fav.  The last was HUGE, and garnished with a deep-fried hot pepper stuffed with cheese.  Hello.  WINNER!!!!!!!  They were so good, by jove it necessitated another round.  Big smiles.  Then there was the food.  Chicken and waffles for one - yum.  Breakfast burrito for another - double yum.  Finally, the enchiladas and eggs for me.  Two sunny-side up eggs perched prettily atop two huge chicken enchiladas with pico, cheese, cowboy sauce.  I could start my morning like that every day.    Wonderful experience thanks to Damon at Momocho.  When a chef recommends another restaurant to you, LISTEN!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences with this place. This was my third or fourth time checking The South Side out. I was attending an event with a few friends. We were able to get a few seats together at the bar.   From the get-go, the bartenders seemed disinterested. This continued to be evident by the fact that I sat with an empty glass for over 10 minutes at one point without being approached. They had run out of the proper glasses to make our drinks at one point, so this delayed us ever further.   The happy hour was a decent deal. They have a few good appetizer and cocktail specials. We had a few of \"The Shandy\" cocktails between us, but it was like rolling the dice each time because the taste varied with the bartender. A couple times the ginger was so overpowering that it was almost impossible to drink.    Overall, I enjoyed this place a majority of the time. It's a good place to come during the happy hour and they currently have a deal with the local CLEseats phone app that allows you to get 15% off of your food and alcohol tab. I'll be back to give it another try to sway me again."}
{"text":"Their shrimp linguine is actually really tasty.    Though not the reason I came here for dinner at 11pm.  That reason would be that it is dark enough where you can kinda get a way with a lot, and by a lot I mean pounding your Blue Moon when your sober dinner mates aren't looking...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to spend a weekend in Cleveland a few weeks ago. No real plans, just need a break and a vacation. If I still lived in Florida, I would be all, \"Wtf am I going to Cleveland???\", but considering it's only a couple of hours from Pittsburgh, why not?  We discovered this gem thanks to a Pgh-Yelp friend and decided to check it out for brunch. So glad we did. What made it an even better experience was the playoff game that the Penguins won, but I digress ...  We sat at the bar and the time we arrived (11.30-ish?) the crowd was still pretty sparse, which was odd to us. We figured we'd show up and there would be a wait, but thankfully, no. We tried so many drinks. Soooo many drinks and all except for one was to our liking. The one wasn't bad, just the taste didn't suit us. I had the smoked salmon plate, which was super delicious! He had the greek omelet, which looked ok and, according to him, was just ok.  Like always, I have to mention the layout - this place was spot on. Loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past 2 weeks. I ended up here because no other bar that also serves food is open on Sunday nights in Tremont [besides Prosperity].  Our bartender, Sarah, I believe her name, was prompt and gave attention to us as we sat at the bar, although I doubt the rest of the customers at the bar could say the same. Caveat: I haven't worked at a bar, but other bartenders: I wouldn't do shots with fellow employees during work hours out at the bar, especially when your bar is about 80% full. Sarah, at least, had just grabbed her drink quickly and immediately went back to work.  I had the Chicken and waffles. It tasted great but I don't think it's extraordinary. The waffle, same size and pressed the same way as typical hotel breakfast buffets and my college's cafeteria, drenched in typical restaurant syrup. The chicken was a large fried single breast."}
{"text":"The South Side is a very good bar with a unique and eclectic food menu. The bar is appealing, clean, and has a very nice selection of draft beers. Smokers will appreciate the cigarette machine, but not the associated price tag. Serving staff have always been polite and courteous.  The ambiance is great for both dates and meeting up with friends. The outdoor patio is great for the warmer months and the indoor fireplace helps keep the glass-enclosed area warm during the frigid winters. The caveat being that there are often gaps in the large doors that make the dining room chilly in the winter. South Side would be wise to improve the weather-proofing to help keep the guests warm.  The food is decent, but I've yet to find a meal that is the home-run I've been looking for. The chicken and waffles is a pretty good entree but my serving of chicken was small with some type of gristle.  I've had pretty good sandwiches as well. They'd suffer in  the ratings if the bar wasn't shouldering most of the praise. Overall, I'll go when invited, but this isn't my first dining choice in the Tremont area."}
{"text":"There are only a few things I miss, since relocating to Los Angeles from Cleveland in 2011.  1. Family and friends. 2. Superior Deli corned beef sandwiches. 3. South Side chicken and waffle plate.  Roscoe's SUCKS! We need a South Side location here in Los Angeles (start off with a food truck?). I'm a real estate agent out here, you guys should contact me!"}
{"text":"This was sort of a bummer experience for me. As per usual, my boyfriend liked his meal, but me: not so much.   I got a red wine sangria (delicious, hard to ruin), and the \"airplane chicken\" and waffle. The hot sauce was good with them, but the actual meal, the chicken and waffle, weren't good. The waffle was so overcooked (basically burnt) that I felt like I was chiseling off pieces of cinder block to dip in the syrup, and there was so much hard, crunchy breading on the sparse amount of actual chicken inside, it all just ended up being an excessively dry and crunchy meal, it's a wonder my mouth wasn't bleeding afterwards. Kinda weird. I partly ordered it bc it was the cheapest thing on the menu ($11), but it also tasted cheap.  The atmosphere is cool, especially the patio, and the service was fine, nothing to write home about. But with all the badassery in Cleveland cuisine, this probably won't be a repeat visit. =/"}
{"text":"First time there. I had stuffed peppers, lobster bisque, calamari, and the grouper sandwich. Also tasted my friends ribeye and green beans. All the food, service, and atmosphere was exceptional! I will be going back there shortly!"}
{"text":"I love the new menu of seasonal fare as well as new cocktails. The atmosphere is always pleasant and the waitstaff top notch. The bartenders are the best. My favorite place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place was the final stop on a whirlwind perfect weekend. And, what a perfect final stop it was.  Sunday morning, all we wanted was brunch, but we both wanted things that were not likely to be found together - I wanted eggs and something spicy, he wanted a chicken breast. We searched long and hard for someplace that would have both, and stumbled upon the brunch menu for The South Side. We both saw EXACTLY what we each wanted - open faced grilled cheese with two eggs and hot sauce for me, and chicken and waffles for him. We took it as a sign - we had to go here.  The weather was perfect and we really wanted to sit outside. We were informed that there was a party about to be seated out there so the wait for the patio would be an hour, but we could be seated inside immediately. We appreciated that flexibility, and appreciated even more so when we were told that the party outside canceled so we could have a coveted patio seat at that moment. The staff was very accommodating and I was impressed with how nice they were about seating us where we wanted.  We ordered our dream brunches and each got a Sunday cocktail, as well. I got the orange bourbon blast (name is not right but you get the idea) and he got a Pimms cup, I believe. Both were DELICIOUS and hit the spot on the warm Sunday afternoon. Our meals were exactly as we expected them - perfect. My grilled cheese had tomato inside, along with the eggs on top, and the perfect amount of hot sauce. I ate the whole thing because it was just too delicious to leave any leftovers. The chicken and waffles was also fantastic, and he was impressed because, \"There is powdered sugar on my chicken! And cinnamon sugar on my waffle! THIS IS THE BEST WAFFLE EVER.\"  I can honestly say I was incredibly impressed. This was the perfect brunch location and the food was absolutely delicious. I'm sure we'll be back before long - whenever we eat have a strange craving for something perfect, I'm sure this will be our first menu option to review."}
{"text":"Went to The South Side recently because we  discovered the CLEseats app. We were able to get 15% off our bill including drinks-which was a big part of the bill. We went with a group of 9 so we saved $30!!!!!. WOW! What a savings. My favorite item was the mussel appetizer. You have to try it if you are a mussels fan. They have several mussel bowels.  The chicken and waffles were fantastic.  The prices are reasonable and they also serve brunch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Coming here is always a treat. If you are in or around the Cleveland area you must come here for their amazing brunches. The bloody Mary's are absolutely delicious and so creative, the Mexican mary being my favorite. And if you are not just drinking your brunch try the breakfast pizza, very tasty and filling. Also Bri was such a great bartender, fast and friendly.   I have a nice morning buzz and I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"The server was nice but had no personality at all.  We ordered the bison chili, chicken n waffle, and drinks.   The bison chili was amazing.  The chicken and waffles left a lot to be desired.  The chicken thigh was tempura battered and had no flavor, the waffle was also flavorless.  It reminded me of carnival food.  It was very bland.  Think sweet and sour chicken-ish (without the sauce).   Next time I will get something different-  I prefer buttermilk fried chicken with traditional seasoned beading and buttermilk waffles.   The atmosphere out on the patio was quiet, but it was over 80 degrees and the fans weren't on; it was stuffy.  The alcohol was fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple beers and some grub with an old coworker / friend on a gloomy Wednesday night.  Just wanted to note that I did try their mussels and they were fantastic.  Great flavor and ended up being quite the meal when it was all said and done.  He tried the blackened grouper sandwich and thought it was pretty good.  I tried to get him to order the Chicken and Waffles but he wasn't feelin it.  See my other review below for a more detailed report on the South Side.  That's all."}
{"text":"So I got lost looking for this place which is totally my fault - I have trouble with Tremont for some reason. Anyway, this place is an AWESOME find!   Went for brunch the other day with a friend. I got the breakfast burrito, and she got the enchiladas. Both were excellent. Coffee and my burrito came to only $9.50. Sweet! Service was also great. Cool atmosphere. Our waitress had the 'High Life Girl/Girl in the Moon' tattooed on her bicep. Had to giver her some props for that.   Next time I'm definitely trying one of the 5 or so different Bloody Mary choices they had too. Probably head back to my Sconnie roots and try the one that comes with a can of Blatz. NICE!   Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Average across the board. Price, quality, service...All average. I've tried a few things here and nothing seemed to be very flavorful and it was all far from memorable. It's a fine place to grab a drink at least. The building exterior is actually really cool, so it had that going for it, right?"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I've been here a few different times food is always really good. I've been there for brunch and I've been there for dinner. My only complaint is I wish they had a bigger beer list. Just not a fan of most of their options. But I do have to say the staff is great!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to think about this place. It took me awhile to find parking for this place (I basically drove around a block looking for one) and then realized that they have their own parking lot right across the street so that is a plus since it is a pain to find parking in Tremont.   The food reminds me a bit of state/county fair food as anything fried is in a corn dog like batter. The veggie burger was decent, not the best but then again it isn't their \"specialty\" as well. My friend's chicken and waffles was delicious on the other hand but beware that they put a lot of syrup on it. Drink wise, decent price for a great drink.  Service was dreadful. The waitress did not check up on us at all until the end when we were waiting for the check. I'm surprised actually that the management doesn't try to push the waitress to get us to drink more because we all know that is where the money comes from.  Things to avoid: Fried Portobello Cap, Veggie Burger Things to have: Alcohol, Chicken and Waffles"}
{"text":"The brunch menu is delicious. Got the open face grilled cheese with a bloody mary and it was better than expected."}
{"text":"We had an awesome Saturday lunch here. The staff was so nice and the food was brilliant. Our server, Sarah, was very helpful and attentive.   I had the spinach and artichoke flatbread. And the rest had the pulled pork and grilled cheese of the day. Happy to see this area of town coming alive!"}
{"text":"Southside in Tremont is a great place to dine, sip and chat with friends.  The ambiance also is a great background for date night.  For those summer nights they feature a beautiful semi private patio.  Some nights they have a musician performing to add a different dimension to your dining experience.  If in doubt order the lobster bisque.....it is amazing.  In addition to the great flavor there are small chunks of lobster throughout.  The chicken and waffles are definitely top 3 in the city.  So basically the food is great.  Be sure to try a specialty cocktail to wash down all the culinary goodness.    Tip:  There is a parking lot right across the street, albeit unpaved."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience. Amazing appetizers and a great wine selection! If it is nice outside, i HIGHLY recommend sitting on the outdoor patio in the back."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Our group had the Grouper sandwich, fish tacos and BBQ chicken flatbread pizza.  Everyone loved what they got.  Service was adequate but server had NO personality.  Never smiled.  Contact was minimal.  Didn't ask if we needed a box for the unfinished pizza.  Had to ask for one.  I would go back for the food, not the service."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! Good booze selection too"}
{"text":"South Side is one of my favorite spots in Tremont. I have been to this place countless times for brunch, lunch, dinner, and even just for drinks and it rarely disappoints. I have had almost everything on the menu (which does change, so there are new options to choose from) and can honestly say it is all delicious. I also am a firm believer they make the best bloody mary's in the United States - the dirty mary (with olive juice and served with blue cheese stuffed olives) is my absolute favorite. Overall, I can't recommend this place enough and highly suggest a visit for any and all occasions!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in CLE. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Chicken and waffles a crowd pleaser, the steak sandwich bomb, and the big dyngus is fire. Definite recommended spot."}
{"text":"One of my earliest exposures and memories of the Tremont neighborhood, I'll always be fond of Southside. It was this cool and trendy but not pretentious restaurant. It's heart-warming to know that it still is. Southside has really become an achor of Tremont, old reliable if you will. I always felt at-ease and comfortable here. I just like how the bar countertop just winds through the length of the restaurant. I like that sun dial art piece on the wall behind the bar. The outside patio is part indoor and outdoor, just so friggin cool. The robust drinking options and the great food menu. The grouper sandwich was always memorable (not sure if it's even on the menu - perhaps it's seasonal?). The stuffed banana peppers app with the chorizo is spicily good. Mac and cheese, although small portioned, is very filling irregardless. Recently I had the pleasure of the pork belly nachos. Two of my favorite foods in one hot plate. Arguably the best nachos you can order in Tremont and may be even Cleveland. Hang out to watch the Cavs play, meet up for happy hour, take your boo out to dinner, celebrate a birthday - Southside has your back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the environment is classy like a mofo. The outside isn't spectacular, but what's going on in the kitchen is really something special. I had the Tacos and a Salad and everything was delicious. It's a great little spot in the middle of Tremont and great people watching.  Bring your friends of a date, the environment is very casual but it has a bit of a upscale feel, though it is very casual. Whatever you do, uss the patio if you can, nothing personal against the inside, but the patio has great atmosphere.  Expect $40 a plate or better but it's totally worth it. The wait staff is also quite exceptional as well! They have so much personality and it's a great kitchen and a gem for Tremont!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love The South Side. The restaurant is hip and trendy and the menu is diverse from light snacks to substantial meals. Unfortunately, everything was just a bit disappointing. The cheese dip that was a happy hour deal was lacking flavor. My Mac and cheese was just ok. Nothing to write home about. My friend's tacos were greasy, the meat not being drained before the taco was built and again, was lacking seasoning. The server was unbelievably friendly and kind but was very slow to take our check. I'm willing to give The South Side another shot hoping I was in on a bad day but another experience like today and I probably won't return again."}
{"text":"The food is always EXCEPTIONAL and so is the service. Very beautiful private patio. I always asked to get seated there. Food. Unparalleled"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch for the second time and it just isn't that great. The monte cristo lacks sweetness in the jam. It's the best thing I've had at South Side. They make a decent Bellini and the Blueberry drink is good. One of the alcoholic coffee drinks was unbearably strong. The breakfast pizza was okay. Also, the breakfast burrito was a little blah. There is nothing great on the brunch menu to bring me back.  Our server looked like she was overloaded with tables. She acted like she didn't have a spare second to waste on our party. She probably spent two minutes between getting drink orders, food orders, checking on us, and bringing the check to our table. I wanted the check split but was not even given a second to ask for that. The server grabbed the check with my card on it and sped walked away.  I understand it's not the server's fault my friend did not have cash on her to pay me back but maybe she could have took two seconds to ask how we wanted the check. So not only was the food sub par, service really bad, but I was out even more money for brunch.  Also can you put a normal light in the restrooms? It's like a nightclub in them and pretty jarring when coming inside from the patio."}
{"text":"Southside is the best side! I have been here several times because it always gets better. Located on a beautiful corner that offers both indoor and outdoor seating, with a cozy inside seating area. The menu is diverse to where all can enjoy something from an appetizer to entree dish. I have had the lobster bisque, wings, pizza, chicken salad, and the steak, which were all delicious! The lobster bisque is one of my favorites thus far and is a must try.   I have also been here on a game day and it is packed with cheering fans, which I love. Whether you are from out of town or in the area, this is a must stop place!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Southside in awhile and a friend asked me to grab lunch. We sat in the attached screened in patio and at first while it seemed warm with a fireplace, it ended up getting pretty chilly.   As such, I ordered the famous grouper sandwich based on Yelp comments and it did not disappoint. I decided to swap my fries for the lobster bisque for a $2 up charge (again based on Yelp reviews). The bisque was one of the best I've ever had. A tad on the pricey side for lunch, but terrific.  They have a parking lot too which is great for Tremont."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to The South Side in Tremont.  And actually, I wasn't the one that chose to dine here, my date did when I asked her \"What's your favorite restaurant in Cleveland?\"  Being a yelper, I of course looked up the reviews and thought \"Uh, oh, this could get interesting...I'm glad she picked it and not me!\". Well I'm pleased to say the restaurant pleasantly surprised me.  We arrived at 6 PM on a Tuesday, and had no problems finding parking. The South Side has a dedicated parking lot right in front of the restaurant, which is a nice feature to have in this neighborhood. I've been to several other restaurants in the area where there was a good bit of walking involved from the car to the restaurant. For me, that's no big deal, but for others it can be a turnoff - especially in winter!  We walked in the door and were promptly seated by the host.  The interior of the restaurant is well decorated, having a seating arrangement ( a substantial bar area, semi-indoor fireplace dining area, an outdoor patio) that could accommodate pretty much any kind of an evening.  Our server arrived promptly and took our drink orders. We both opted for the \"Leinenkugel Summer Shandy\" (the dates idea).  I'm not usually a beer before dinner person, and even less so beer mixed with lemonade, but I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised.  I found it to be very refreshing on this warm muggy evening.  So much so that we had a second round =)    For appetizers we split the Chorizo and Parmesan stuffed banana peppers w/plum tomato red sauce and citrus aioli and the sesame-crusted yellow fin tuna seared rare with seaweed salad, sweet soy, cucumber wasabi and tangy orange sauce.  (Thanks, Cara for the banana pepper recommendation in your review!)  The tuna was seared perfectly with the center still chilled and firm - just the way I like it.  Actually, I'm a sashimi fan so it was \"ready before it hit the pan\" but that's a story for another review.  The accompanying sauces were excellent and were a nice pairing. The banana peppers blew me away!  OK, so I love hot and spicy food ,and man they nailed the spices for me on these.  I could have had a couple more for dinner and been a happy camper.  The plum tomato sauce was spot on and I enjoyed sampling the citrus aioli.    Presentation on both appetizers was excellent, and on the tuna, one could say artful.  I've uploaded pictures. Service to this point in the evening was also excellent - and we had a very friendly and smiley server that was happy to discuss the dishes and even made a recommendation for me on the main - which I took.  At this point in the evening I'm thinking \"Wow...this place is great...something must have changed or they are having a great night\".   My date ordered the classic Caesar salad with Salmon and I went with the servers recommendation of grilled swordfish with lobster risotto, grilled asparagus, and sweet rosemary buerre blanc.  So here is South Side's first (and only) service misstep: they were too fast on the serving the mains.  They turned the order so quickly, we hadn't even finished half the appetizer yet.  Not a huge issue, but definitely a miss.  Presentation on the mains were excellent (picture of the grilled halibut uploaded) as were the flavors.  The halibut was grilled correctly, the risotto was spot on, and the accompanying rosemary buerre blac was wonderful.  Not good for the ole cholesterol level I'm sure, but oh well.  Overall, gasp, everything was great, and out the door for $66 before tip.  I'm going to give them the five stars that I think they deserved for this dining experience.  If I could have given 4.5 stars I would have (early mains) but I'm certainly not going to take them down to a 4 star for that.  ATMOSPHERE- A SERVICE - B+ FOOD - A  PRICE - A"}
{"text":"I have SUCH mixed feelings about South Side. I've always avoided it b/c I've had a few sub-par dining experiences there. However, I went earlier this week when nothing else was serving food and had the mussels (of all things to choose...) and they were really good! I'm not saying I'm rushing back -- maybe I found the one good thing? I don't know. I heard the mac and cheese is good too. I will no longer avoid south side .. that's positive, right?"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch! I've been to this place a couple of times and never made up my mind of how much liked the place. The first couple of times, it was just ok. This time for lunch it was great. Our server was awesome, she was so helpful and very attentive. I had the lobster bisque and I will say that for the price you can't beat it. It was only $7.75 with tax included, SCORE!   I also planned my studs surprise birthday brunch here a few weeks ago. It went so well! There were 14 of us and usually servers are very irritated and hard to deal with when there are so many people in a group, however our servers were great. They were so patient with us. All of our food came out at once and our drinks very flowing."}
{"text":"Went here with a group on Tuesday night. Three drinks, a flatbread, and a side salad for ~ $24 was a - ok by me. The Blue Bayou,  a special for the night, was a vodka based drink infused with blueberries. Perfect for the 90 - degree day! The side salad was surprisingly good. Mixed greens, cukes, tomatoes, and cheese. The balsamic dressing was a bit heavy. Next time I will ask what other options they offer. The flatbread was round - shaped,  like a pizza. That was a bit unexpected,  but regardless it was very good.  Our server was attentive but not intrusive, and she split the check for our party of 6, which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"The Blackened Grouper Sandwich...the only thing I come for *drops mic* ....Okay, the calamari is amazing too...A lot of their food is. I just can't pry myself away from the blackened grouper. Not to mention that I absolutely despise fish sandwiches, but will eat this one! Order it and see why. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here after work since they opened and I will never go back since they have removed the chicken & waffles from the late night menu. I have been telling people to come here for years for the sole fact that they served it till 2am, 7 days a week. Worst decision I've ever seen a bar/restaurant make in the 18 years I've worked in the industry. If management makes such bad choices with the menu I can only imagine what other bad decisions they will be making. Avoid this place.  Beef brisket sliders were bland and dry, though coleslaw was good.  Steak sandwich was also bland and dry.  Homemade chips were burnt.  Lobster bisque was tasty, though I'm 90% positive it was made with crawfish, but was smothered in cheep croutons which had to be picked out.   None of the dishes were even close to as tasty as the Chicken & Waffles."}
{"text":"I'd probably rate this higher except for the fact that the patio they have closed off for the winter basically doesn't have weather seal. We sat freezing for the entirety of the lunch. Seal up those gaps! I bet you could make back the cost of weather seal with a single day of heating that patio. Or just cut your losses and only seat inside. I would not eat here again if they tried to sit me outside.  The food itself was good. We had a few plates of calamari which were crispy and delicious. I don't really even like most sea food, but a lot of the fish taste was masked with the sauces and frying. I had \"The Big Dyngus\" sandwich for lunch. It's a good sausage with tasty chili on top. I didn't try any of the most recommended items for The South Side."}
{"text":"Since my first visit last year, I always try to make it here at least once when I head home for a visit.  The service is always good, the menu is reasonable, and they have good specials.  They have two areas to eat.  If you want an area that is a bit quieter to have a conversation, I would suggest the other room with the fire place. Often the other side has live music or can be loud.  I have always enjoyed the food I ordered.  They are great at accommodating vegetarians as I altered the special to be without seafood.  My friend was quite pleased as he received my extra shrimp.   They have a good selection of beers, and a good selection of wine. My only complaint is that they get rid of the horrid rose wine.  The staff does not like it, I tried it and it was awful.  Perhaps a new one would be better... I could think of my suitable replacements.  Other than that, I am quite content with this place, and I will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"We drove out here hoping to enjoy the patio but it rained on the way there, so we got the next best thing, the back room with huge glass windows/doors. We shared the mussels which were okay. The tomato base just wasn't my thing, my boyfriend enjoyed it. He got the steak sandwich, he said it was insanely filling. I got the portabella and goat cheese sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was very very good, it was a lot of bread, which is fine, I just didn't finish the bread. The salad was epic, I chose a truffle vinaigrette for it and I loved it. I really wish I could have taken a bottle home. If the owners read this please bottle this and charge max, I will still buy it!!!!  Their beer selection was really nice and diverse. We tried a few, all of which were good.  Our service was good, the gentleman who waited on us was super sweet and attentive. I wish I caught his name.  Again a wonderful experience, great food, s ervixe and atmosphere.  Ps- They are currently part of Cle Seats so they honored a discount."}
{"text":"Stopped by South Side for a going away party/shower recently and we had brunch. On our way to our table, I noticed that a young, hip crowd packed the place. There were 10 of us and we had a reservation, so we were promptly seated. Our server was friendly and was cracking jokes throughout the meal.  To start off, I ordered a bacon bloody Mary because I've only had one bloody Mary before and I didn't like it. So I thought I'd give it one more try because Southside is known for good Bloody Marys.  When I received my bloody Mary, it looked tasty, but tasted awful. It was extremely salty, but I guess that's how bloody Marys are supposed to taste. It was spicy with salt, pepper, and hot sauce in it. I like tomato juice, but I hate bloody Marys. The strip of bacon was tasty. I ended giving the drink to someone who likes bloody Marys. I probably will never order one again.  For brunch, I ordered the burrito minus the tortilla. It ended up being scrambled eggs with some cheese and salsa, which was tasty. After seeing everyone else's food, I would've preferred the biscuits and gravy, which looked amazing. And it sounded even better based on the 'Wows!' from the crowd. I tasted my wife's waffle and it was saturated in syrup and extremely sweet. She is not a fan of extreme sweets, so I finished off her waffle.  The server was awesome and the food was very good. The atmosphere was upbeat and young. I'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i were looking for a nice relaxing brunch on a Sunday. We had both been to The South Side before for lunch and enjoyed it so we decided to give brunch a shot, and im so glad we did!  We walked in and it was crowded but not obnoxiously so. We put our name on the list for a table and were told it would be about a 45 minute wait. (not sure if they take reservations, but worth looking into for next time)  We deciced to grab a cocktail at the bar while we waited for our table. We learned a few minutes later that seats at the bar were \"first come first serve\", so we decided to sit there instead.  I ordered a bacon bloody mary which was AWESOME. My boyfriend got a raspberry iced coffee which was raspberry vodka, iced coffee and cream, also very good. The menu was very diverse, and we had trouble choosing something because it all sounded so good! I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito, which i swear had to have like 5 eggs in it. it had chorizo, onions and several different kinds of peppers. my boyfriend ordered enchilladas and eggs, which looked amazing, but i was too excited about my own food to try it. he said it was very good. We had a great, relaxing sunday, and enjoyed our brunch very much! we will definately be returning!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and I really like it. I like the atmosphere, good service and just the vibe really. I have had their chorizo burger with egg and really enjoyed it. Their steak sandwich also very good. On this specific occasion it was a Monday night with half off appetizers. We got the tacos were you get 3. I enjoyed the pork with goat cheese the chicken and barbacoa not so much. Who I was with got the bison steak on top of a type of potato pancake and it was really good. I tried their muscles with spinich and chorizo it was good but I could of done without the Chorizo. Also got the Bison and black bean chilli which was also really good. Overall I've enjoyed the things I've tried here with some that I can do without but there is a large variety and a good vibe. You should check it out."}
{"text":"The South Side is Okay.  I've never experienced bad service here, however never overly friendly either.  Let's just say that is not the reason I come here.  The reasons I come here are: 1)  One of the few late night food options in Tremont 2)  Awesome patio  The atmosphere they really have going for them.  There's a nice long  bar and usually seats available, there's an indoor patio as well as an outdoor patio.  Best of both worlds.    South Side is never my first choice for going out at night, but more of a default option.  Sometimes a bit pretentious."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Saturday with friends. Started out with a Bacon Bloody Mary- yum I could have drank them all afternoon. Had the blackened grouper sandwich without the bread it was cooked perfectly and tasted great with the citrus aioli they served it with. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Wow, and not in a good way. We went in on Memorial Day and sat at the bar. I ordered hummus before I even ordered my screwdriver and waited 25 min before it came. And then waited another 20 min before the chorizo burger came out. The bar tender kept saying it'll be out in a min. After the 3rd time she said that it got annoying. Clearly it will not be out in a min bc 15 min ago you said that. Then there was the burger itself. It was so tiny and there was so much extra bun. The egg on top was not even warm... The chips were delicious and the hummus was amazing! I'm still giving them 3 stars, but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"It's been about two years since the last time I was at the South Side. I don't particularly remember having the egregiously terrible service that I'm reading about in some of these other reviews, but I don't remember having the warm and fuzzies after eating here, either. I do remember being unimpressed with the menu.  In either event, I have to say that management must have read some of these negative reviews circa 2011-2012 and took them to heart!   I went for a fun work lunch today, and I have to say that the service was both friendly and efficient. The food was phenomenal!   Everyone was happy with their lunch choices, and it came out quickly. I ordered the chicken prosciutto sandwich and rosemary jo-jos, and it was absolutely delicious and beautiful. The presence of the Bossman was the only thing stopping me from pulling out my phone to snap pics of the gorgeous presentation.  I hope those who haven't been to the South Side in a while due to poor service will give it another shot!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years so I've tried to avoid saying something negative but the last 3 times we've come in I've left angry. Putting aside getting a flop of a monthly special and things like that, let me be clear in saying they seriously need to do something about their hostesses.  Either rude or incompetent, I've walked out twice now because of them. That seriously can't be good for business. The first person I encounter when I walk in the door just immediately upsets me? Come on guys, you can do better."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant.  Great patio seating especially when the weather is great.  Great food and drink happy hour deals.  Amazing food!"}
{"text":"My wife and i haven't been to the south side in while, so decided to come here for the \"grouper sandwich\" which they are known for... we sat down and looked at the menu and they changed the grouper sandwich and made it the \"original grouper sandwich\".  so we tried it out and really didn't care the change. They changed the type bread and the toppings on the sandwich.  Im still a Fan of South side even though they change my go to sandwich."}
{"text":"I (mostly) really like South Side, with one exception.  Only on weeknights in the early evening.  All the complaints about bad service seem to occur on busier evenings - on a busy Saturday night the place is probably 2 stars.  If you drive by and the parking lot is totally full, it's probably not worth it.  That said, the early evening staff seems to be much friendlier and better at actually caring about taking your order.  The food here is really very tasty and they have some of my favorite cocktails in town.  My favorites on the menu are the appetizers/small plates - chicken enchiladas, mozzarella moons, calamari - all so good.  I like the enclosed patio with the fireplace - it is a little quieter back there.  The bar is also ENORMOUS and perfect for watching a game or having a quick drink.  Come for an early dinner.  Unfortunately, I think it's a pass for late-night drinking ."}
{"text":"Having so many friends in Tremont and Ohio City, I go to South Side almost every time I'm in Cleveland. Whether its for a late night drink or 3, or having that crucial Sunday recovery brunch, I'm there. The food here is decent. Nothing to write home (or Yelp!) about. But decent none the less. Chicken and waffles are good, true that, but I've tried blackened grouper and macncheese that did the trick as well. I swear I had crabcakes, poached eggs and hollanndaise that saved my life one morning. I've only experienced bad service here once. I was with a few friends, maybe 6 of us. One friend forgot his ID and was therefore not allowed to drink. That was straight. Cool. But two other friends, who are Chinese, only had passports and greencards, and were also denied alcohol. As far as photo identification goes, I'm not sure how much more official you can get than a passport/greencard. We could have got up and walked over to Parralax and had a blast, but we decided to just eat. Service got worse from there, but ill spare the details. Server beatdowns on Yelp! are played out anyways. I will say that even after crap service, she put 20% gratuity on our checks without any kind of warning. Not cool, lady. All in all The South Side is a decent spot and quickly becoming a Cleveland staple. Ok, probably just a Tremont staple."}
{"text":"A few years ago my rowdy friends got me kicked out of here twice within a couple week period. One friend talked about a girl who walked by and said \"bizaz\" and she told her brother. Her brother tried to fight us. He said \"Nobody talks about my sister's ass!\" my friend replied \"I said bizaz. It means breasts in Arabic.\" and that made the man more upset. None of this should have happened. We were a wacky pack of guys at that point and deserved to be kicked out. I apologize to the girl, the brother, the owner and staff of South Side. This is a good place to grab a nice and affordable meal."}
{"text":"I'm lovin' on The South Side. I really like the atmosphere of this place more than the food. You have places inside that could be a little more intimate and then you have a nice deck outside with a couple TV's that I just want to bring a big group of friends and hang out. Their menu, while it might be a little too extensive, is pretty tasty looking -- I found it hard to choose! The crab dip and duck pizza apps are certainly favorites of mine! The one thing they really missed the mark on was the calamari and you don't have to be a calamari snob like me to agree :-) It was so so soggy and incredibly greasy. I know I shouldn't expect good seafood out of the midwest, but this was bad. Everything else that I've experienced however has been a delight, so yes, I'll be back. I'll just remember to never order calamari again."}
{"text":"While they were very busy and possibly not staffed for it, service was an as little contact as possible operation. This has been the case on prior visits though as well. Our waitress was never rude, but certainly not warm - very businesslike. She did what she had to do, and she even noted in passing that our food would be ready soon, but overall service is better elsewhere.   The place was empty upon arrival for lunch at 11:30a. By the time we left at 12:30p however the entire place was filled inside - both the bar tables and dining room tables as well as every bar stool.    I ordered the Chorizo Burger. Chorizo and a fried egg are great together at all times and this burger, served on an appropriate sized bun, was no exception. I was looking forward to and liked the red cabbage slaw. The cilantro jalapeño relish however was not my favorite flavor and while likely intentional, having a cold relish on the burger seemed a bit off. What was warmer than room temperature however was my pickle.   The burger came with chips, but I subbed in a salad and a friend subbed in a soup both of which were nice cup sized sides.   Overall the menu is rather large and diverse and there were even a few specials. Healthy options are available too. Clearly a popular spot, and with a patio just waiting for warmer days, Southside is a decent choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's were absolutely to die for.  Got the portobello sandwich, and the mushrooms were tough. Not easy to bite into. Did not receive the right sauce for the sandwich and did not end up eating my meal until I went home because of a time crunch and a lack of urgency.   Not entirely impressed with the food, although the chicken and waffles is definitely something to get! Took a bite and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Tremont is just a cool neighborhood full of great dining, and great bars, and great art all wrapped in laid back atmosphere.  The South Side reflects the neighborhood perfectly. The menu here has an interesting blend of choices ranging from kobe burgers, caprese sandwiches, chicken and waffles, and a number of other interesting choices. The food is very good and reasonably priced (read not cheap). I've generally not had problems with the service that others have yelped. The crowd ranges from suits to hipsters. All in all, good food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"always can count on good food! Great for comfort food and last night eating."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I enjoyed all the blends and combination of flavors. The chicken and waffles was cooked to perfection with the chicken fried perfectly and still very moist. The waffle was light and crisp. The sriracha hot sauce was the perfect combination... Better than any regular hot sauce. The tuna burger was surprisingly delicious since I thought I was getting an ahi tuna burger. It had pickled onions, ginger, wasabi mayo and soy reduction sauces. It was very good. I had the side of fried green beans instead of chips, and they were delicious and cooked with lots of garlic. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"South Side is our Tremont go-to for brunch, lunch, and dinner. The service is always fantastic and the food (especially the chicken and waffles) is always spot on. I am fortunate that this is in walking distance to my house! The prices are not bad for the amount of food you get and the atmosphere is great. I love the outdoor patio in the warm weather to sit with friends and sip a Sunday morning bloody mary!"}
{"text":"Sausage Flatbread was so-so (sounded better than it was). The chicken & waffles were what I expected. The menu sounded amazing, but that word is a little far-reaching compared to what we ate. Another visit is in order for a final verdict.   Atmosphere was great- live music made it perfect for a Friday night.   Drink-wise I ordered the Medalist (a Margarita-like concoction with Cointreau). I'm quite certain it wasn't crafted properly. I was completely intoxicated halfway in, and while I don't like to complain about a heavy pour, I also like to experience other flavors in my drink besides alcohol. This theory is further supported by the stumbling, glassy-eyed appearance of the little lady who made my drink. I'll be sticking to their well-assembled beer list next time.  Fingers crossed for a more perfect experience next visit- I really want to like it!"}
{"text":"I'll get to the real review soon but have to start with my most recent visit.  It was a long day, probably 12 plus hours at work and I was starving.  I figured SouthSide wouldn't be too busy knowing the neighborhood very well and was able to roll right in and down to a bar stool without problem.  The food here is pretty solid and service typically consistent.  Unfortunately this night was the exception.  I sat at the bar...and waited.  I could see the bartender at the end of the bar, but with her back to the entire room I couldn't tell you what she was doing.  I could tell you what she wasn't doing, which was servicing any of the customers.  I sat for about 10 minutes, not a hello, not a water, not a look in my direction.  It was when the woman next to me volunteered she'd been waiting for at least five minutes before I sat down for her check that I walked out. Best part was no one even noticed (or cared).  I haven't been back since I don't think I will. Seeing as I dine out 5 days a week I know better quality and I left there thinking this place must think itself just too cool for me.  As for my other experiences (at least 6 or 7 previous visits) I can say this. The atmosphere is good to great.  Cozy, cool, calm and the patio wonderful. The location is ideal and I've had some great table service (though never great bar service).    The food is gastro-pub to enlightened bar food.  It's fair to above average and the chicken and waffles used to be good but was definitely changed in recent memory.  It was one of their best dishes and unfortunately isn't the same.  That said I'd recommend Deagen's always over South Side for that dish.  The wings are solid and above average but not worth driving too.  The appetizers good but again not great.  I'd say my favorite dish is the Mac and Cheese with chicken.  Rich, creamy, and delicious.  So if you're looking for fair prices and unpretentious food in Tremont I'd make this an option.  The location is ideal and that patio is great but do yourself a favor and consider the Tremont Tap House instead.  It wins in every category expect atmosphere but far exceeds in ambiance, taste, service and beer selection."}
{"text":"I happened upon Southside on a late Sunday evening. I love hanging out in Tremont, but I have my favorite bars and restaurants I always go to since I don't live in the neighborhood. I usually go to Tremont after work on weekdays for dinner with friends or to the bars/lounges on a Saturday night. However, it was my first Sunday evening in Tremont and I was starving. Most of restaurants were closed and I was definitely bummed. I thought this would have been a good opportunity to try something new. We went into Treehouse for a drink and asked the bartender what was open for dinner. He recommended Southside. I'd passed by it, but never gone in and was excited that was open.   Tremont seemed a bit dead on Sunday evening, but definitely not at the Southside. It seemed like everyone who wanted to go out on a cold fall Sunday evening was at the Southside. Though cold outside it was warm and filled with just the right amount of people inside. The glow of the place and the just-interesting-enough-but-not-too-loud-where-you-have-to-yell-to-be-heard guitarist up front in the main area was enough to make us eat at the bar (there were no tables available in the main area and we didn't want to sit in the screened in patio). The bartender was friendly and reminded us about the weird church-instated liquor laws for Sunday night in Tremont means \"beer only\". We ordered food and drinks. My lobster bisque was incredible. We had a great time and never had to wait for a refill... that being said we definitely stayed later than expected and when the clock struck midnight and it was technically \"Monday\", the liquor started flowing at the Southside once again. Overall a great time!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal experience at the South Side.  Went yesterday for brunch and did not realize it was National Waffle Day.  Well I had to treat myself to their delicious version of Chicken and Waffles.  Delicious combo of crunchy fried chicken breast and a sweet waffle drenched in maple syrup.  Dipping the chicken into the side of siracha hot sauce made my taste buds very happy. My husband ordered the Big Nasty Brunch Burger which was a burger served on top of french toast with bacon, cheddar cheese, chorizo gravy, onion ring and fried egg.  Not something I would ever order, but he cleaned his plate. We were seated on the enclosed patio and luckily had a spot near the gas fireplace.  That helped keep us warm on a cold Cleveland day."}
{"text":"The draw of South Side to me is the late kitchen with real food.  You can order all but the entrees until 2:00 am which is a good alternative when you need something to eat late at night.  The food is very good but I think the chicken and waffles is overrated.    I have been there at different times from real late to dinner time and have found the service to be lacking and sometimes a real turn off."}
{"text":"Chicken.... and waffles. I can't review anything else. This is so amazing that its the only thing I ever get. I always ask for my chicken extra crispy - I guess its just a personal preference.   I love the ambiance here. You definitely need to ensure you're on the enclosed patio... its cozy and cute. Best place to be in the summer."}
{"text":"Went here in the summertime, sorry for the delayed review! Went with a party of four and was able to sit outside. They have a great patio! Beautiful and very private. I have not sat inside yet, and this was the only time I went to the establishment. Parking was tough because the entire lot was full. Our waitress was very nice, not as bad as some of the other reviews on here, so maybe they have improved since those were written? Drinks were good and food was good. My husband had heard the chicken and waffles were great, and he did order it and enjoyed it very much! I would like to go back and visit again to try more dishes, definitely in the summer but hopefully I will get there sooner."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years, but last night was my first time in a year. We seem to go here more for the nice sized patio than the food.   The food is good, but not great. The service is good, but not great and the staff are good, but not great.   Again, nice sized patio and decent food, but definitely better options in Tremont neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service has made a 180.  Meaning its getting better. Shrimp w bacon, bruschetta, and shish kabob all good food as usual."}
{"text":"I have literally NEVER tried something at south side that was short of absolutely delicious. I'm a bit of a mac and cheese snob--they nail it with a creaminess that is just perfect, while still not being too runny--really sticks to the noodles. I personally like to add chorizo, my boyfriend tried the buffalo chicken as a mix in and it was equally yummy. It seems like everyone pretty much agrees that one of their star dishes has to be the chicken and waffles. They're right--you will not be disappointed! Wings are fabulous as well...and don't get me started on their bloody marys for brunch (I love the American dream Mary, served with a fried pickle and a can of hamm's!) I could go on and on. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Their dinner menu is great - but skip over that and go for the chocolate cake!!! YUM, yum yum!!!! And try their mixed drinks - very unique and tasty!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! It's located in the trendy neighborhood of Tremont. We had a party of 20 plus and service was fantastic!!!!! This is a great spot for both a small and large groups (private room)."}
