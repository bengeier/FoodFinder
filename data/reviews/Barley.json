{"text":"Went to Barley not too long ago. I was early for a meeting and decided to stop by to get a smoothie bowl, I had heard great things and decided to give it a try. I ordered my drink at 9:20 am. I was waiting near the cash for them to complete my order. At around 9:55/10:00am, someone finally gave me my order. Between the time I paid for my order and received it, I noticed that they waited for other customers to order the same thing, before they even started to make it or prepare it. It took less than 5 minutes to prepare that one batch of the same order. I waited 30 mins for them to finish something that could've easily taken them 5 mins to complete. It seems to me that everyone behind the counter should be trained to make everything on the menu. I love the concept and most people I know have had a great experience with Barley. Although, I do think they need to execute better time management & whoever is managing should take the time to train staff to be more efficient."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great ambiance with healthy selection of breakfast. I tried the safari smoothie bowl and my friend le tasse devil and both are yummy. We both took the beet latte with macadamia nut, it was rather tasteless, as I was expecting more macadamia nut flavor or perhaps more beet flavor to it. However I would certainly come back"}
{"text":"Last time I came to Barley was through Yelp Elite event. The history behind creating this cereal bar was delightful. We came after hours (technically after supper... so breakfast after supper sounds funny), and I enjoyed that event a lot.

I have few projects to work on; so I decided to take on my work the earliest morning. I decided to come to Barley for breakfast and work on my projects. I realize I didn't appreciate Barley at my first my visit, but now I am planning to make this spot as my working place. 

The place is huge. Natural light from outside is a huge plus. The service is amazing. The workers know well the products that they are selling to you! Impressive. The seats are super comfortable. Like the couches... I can easily fall asleep. ;) I had a matcha latte and the chlorophyll sandwich. It was delish! 

There are electrical outlets everywhere; so need to charge your laptop or phone... Perfect! Obviously Free WiFi. 

The concept of cereal bar seems odd... but it's more than cereal bar, you got filling smoothies, sandwich, oatmeal, salads...and more. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This corner spot opened earlier this week on the hip Notre Dame Street in Little Burgundy. The space is really nicely done; comfortable banquet seating against one wall, high tables and chairs on the other, and a regular table and chairs in the back of the store near the cash. The space is sleek and modern, offering a comfortable space to grab a quick bite or a cup of coffee. The space is actually perfect for those looking for a space to work at, with plugs everywhere and single seating designed as workstations; they even have a huge conference room in the back of the venue. Heads up that there's a huge TV in the back where they had cartoons playing: a cereal bowl and morning cartoons, yes please! 

The menu includes smoothie bowls, parfaits, cereals, salads, and even ice cream! Full coffee bar too! You can actually see the different cereals and granolas they have to offer on the back wall behind the cash, including granolas and rare cereals you can't get in Canada like Frankenberry. You place your order at the counter, and you're given an aloe plant with a number to indicate your order number. You take a seat and your order is brought to your table; cute! 

The staff was super helpful and friendly! Looking at the menu before approaching, I was approached by a manager who took the time to explain the concept, and the menu, and helped me decide on my order. We were also approached a few times by the staff while eating with questions on the food and coffee, which I thought was great, as you can tell that they really hope the place succeeds and they care about their costumers feedback. 

As I've never had a \"smoothie bowl\", I opted for the \"Tassie Devil\" which comes with fresh berries, açai smoothie, and chocolate granola. Delicious! Fresh fruit, tasty smoothie and I really loved that granola mix too. The portion was very generous and I couldn't finish the bowl, so I would say well worth the 11$. I also grabbed a latte with my order; you have a choice of rice, macadamia, or soy milk instead of just cow's milk. The coffee was perfect, good espresso base and the latte art made it more enjoyable! 

I really liked my visit at this new venue and loved this concept of a \"cereal bar\"; it's different, it's fun, the food is good, the space is great, and the service was excellent! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Je cherchais un brunch à Montréal et je suis tombée par hasard sur Barley. La deco est sympa mais c'est très (trop) bruyant et ce n'était même pas plein, impossible d'entendre la serveuse. Service convenable mais sans plus. Personnellement je trouve leur brunch bien trop cher pour ce que c'est...20$ pour un croissant avec un peu de salade dedans, ce n'est pas donner, même si c'était plutôt bon."}
{"text":"I was very torn between 3-4 or 5 stars. 

Here's my first impression of the place. We went on a Saturday. 

Very cute decor, friendly, inviting and dog friendly! They said over the phone they highly encourage you to bring your pouch! Extra brownie points for me who was two dogs. (One little one big) 

We walked in and it was not overly busy but a decent amount of tables, You order at the counter and they give you a cute cactus with a number on it. It's a little faded and hard to see. 

They got pretty busy about 15 minutes after we ordered. We'd order two Matcha lattes, a smoothie bowl and avocado toast.  It look us thirty minutes to get our lattes and then another 25 minutes to get our food. We had to ask twice what was happening because people who'd sat down after us had gotten drinks and food before us. We were pretty annoyed but the staff was very apologetic, because they were short staffed and they'd dropped our ticket. Meh it's ok it happens. 

The annoying part was they took a reservation (they don't normally but made an exception for two mom's with 5 kids between them for a birthday) and hadn't marked the table we'd been sitting at for 20 Minutes and then proceeded to make us move twice, (which is fine.. it happens we sat at a table of four because it was the only one available at the time in the area we wanted to sit in and a staffer had said it was ok.) but after making us move they ended up putting the reserved table somewhere completely different. Essentially disturbing us twice for nothing.  Meh. It happens.

I found their system for delivering food and drinks a little flawed. As mentioned before the little cactus numbers are hard to see, causing the busboy/food runner difficulty of where to drop the food. We saw the poor guy wondering up and down trying to find the number he was looking for. It's a cute idea but not really feasible in my mind. 

ALL the staff where very apologetic and sweet, which makes up for all the little mistakes and what not...Growing pains right? 

I've never had a smoothie bowl or avocado toast before and both were delicious in my opinion and nicely presented. (Check out the pictures) 

It was a little hectic with our decently behaved doggie, but there was a few kids running around and a lot going on. Tables are very close to each other but no one minded our furbaby. Just something to take into consideration when bringing your fur child in.  Maybe it's quieter during the week. 

I ended up going with five stars because overall including all the bumps and bruises of our three hour long brunch, we had a good time, with good food and absolutely lovely staff.  

Looking forward to returning and trying more things from the menu! :)"}

This is such an awesome brunch spot! If you're going to the Atwater market and want a nice option for brunch or a lunch, Barley is the place!! 

They have a cool cereal bar concept, and a really great brunch menu. I came on a Sunday and got a table with no issue. 

The restaurant is really aesthetic...they have the nicest seating and really cool plants and decor to make for s great ambience. The servers are also super friendly and helpful. 

Decided on s couple of things and shared...avocado toast, granola bowl, quinoa salad, and frittata. Everything arrived looking so picturesque. This place was super instagrammable. 

I personally had the avocado toast and it was amazing. Really nicely done. I also tried some quinoa salad which was a very large portion size and quite filling! 

I also had to get their cereal ice cream in which you choose a cereal and they make it into a McFlurry type of thing...I got fruity pebbles ice cream which was delicious. 

The prices are also quite reasonable here. In all a
Really solid brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool vibe, food is slightly expensive but tastes good. My fave lattes also!"}
