{"text":"So sad to see them go after such a short period of time.  For a kosher restaurant, they made really good pizza and falafel, the falafel was always stuffed full of salads.  The pizza had just the right amount of cheese on it, and the crust was the perfect thickness.  The prices were ok, but most of the time with kosher food, it is more expensive than non kosher."}
{"text":"True, I tend to send random Food suggestions to others.  It takes a period of time before the blood flow settles back to her brain from too much Food crawling overdose-itis, then and only then will she realize why I send her a restaurant website for Pizza take-out.   :P  Bete Avon has a similar meaning to Bon Appetite (more accurately \"With Appetite\") but it's the Hebrew version.  Now you know and so do I, after the Cook kindly explained.  That's why they had that COR(Kosher) logo on their window.  How do you link a Jewish Pizza Joint with the Tunisian House Specials?  It looks like Shakshuka is popular in Israel originally introduced by you guessed it, Tunisian Jews.  Which came first?  Ketchup on Sunnyside Eggs   ...or...   Shakshuka  Shakshuka($8.95)  -  Think in terms of a freshly cooked down Salsa consisting of Tomato, Onions, Green Bellpepper, Garlic and Spices then add 2 Eggs on top until cooked to runny Yolk consistency.  Served pipping hot, every bite of the Sauce had me blowing steam out of my mouth.  Flavour-wise it taste just like how it looks, much like a Pasta Sauce with Poached Eggs except Spice was limited to mild at best.  Tunisian Sandwich($7.50)  -  I had no clue what to expect of it until I saw Protein on Protein.  Sliced Boiled Egg AND Tuna in one sandwich must be a Bodybuilders Dreamwich.  The Toppings inside the warm Sesame topped Whole Wheat Bun were Pickle Slices, Carrot Slices, something spicy and Babaganoush.  BTW, Shakshuka seem to need 10-15 minutes to be served. BTW#2, I do realize it's slightly pricey for what it is, but how much do you guys pay for the common Huevos Rancheros nowadays?"}
{"text":"Bete Avon has a really strange menu. When my Yelp friend suggested that why we come here and sent me their menu on justeat.ca and I was thinking gee Pizza?? Why we are coming all the way to have pizza... then I saw...   Tunisian Sandwich ($7.50) and Shaksuka ($8.95)? What are those? I have no idea... ended up I was lucky since none of them has raisins inside!!   Tunisian Sandwich is really tuna and egg sandwich with spicy sauce..It was quite good especially the whole wheat French baguette. The pickles and eggplants garnishes went well with the spicy sauce made this sandwich refreshing and light!   Shaksuka means mixture which is really eggs cooked in tomato, onions and spices eaten with bread. It for sure sounded like something I would have for breakfast or brunch!   Bete Avon is a friendly family runned business. Really simple like any pizza takeout joint. There are some tables that you can enjoy your food on paper plate with plastic utensils.   BTW, the staffs started laughing when we were cross examing our food and taking photos.. They wouldn't believe that we just ordered something that we don't know what they really are?!"}
