{"text":"Gave this cafe a second chance and you know what....it redeemed itself in my book. I won't say why I was disappointed the first time because it's all about second chances here. Here's why I revoked my downvote: I can't deny that this place is cozy. To me, it feels like a 50's hobbit hole. It's warmly lit, and there's a connecting kitchen that sits between Norah's vintage shop, so naturally it feels very homey. 

I ordered the keylime pie and chocolate croissant and both were down right excellent.  The pie was made fresh that day in the cafe which was a plus. With the dessert, I ordered an Americano misto that was smooth and well-rounded."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast and or Brunch. Had the hang over hash and was very impressed. The regular drip coffee is exactly how I like it. Strong. My girlfriend also had a fantastic latte with her fresh bagel and cream cheese. 

The vibe in the place is also excellent. Will definitely be going back. 

Thanks for a great brunch.

Definitely expensive at 41$ for breakfast for two. But I'll say this is one of the few occasions when the quality of the meal and experience justified the price."}
{"text":"Ooohh such a cute place that looks fantastic but the staff is as cold and pretentious as the menu."}
{"text":"Mon expérience écho celle des critiques précédentes : en gros, l'endroit est assez inconsistant, je veux aimer mais en même temps il y a définitivement un quelque chose qui manque. 

J'ai vais à l'occasion depuis un an vu que j'habite à deux coins de rue. 

Les cafés: la qualité dépend vraiment de qui le prépare. Il y avait un employé avant qui faisait des boissons lactées avec une mousse incroyable, fine fine, paradisiaque, mais il ne semble plus travailler là.

Les viennoiseries: j'ai essayé les chocolatines aux pistaches et croisants aux pistaches. Un peu sèches mais très gouteuses.

L'ambiance: la terrasse l'été est mignonne. Sinon, côté décor intérieur, ce n'est pas assez chaleureux à mon goût, le style rétro semble davantage plaqué là qu'illustrer l'ambiance de l'endroit. Clientèle très variée.

Service: il s'améliore, mais pendant longtemps il était impossible de se faire servir en français, et, souvent, on sentais qu'on dérangeait les employés dès qu'on poussait la porte (le café vide). Je me suis aussi déjà fait charger le prix d'un latte (dispendieux - 5/6$ dépendant de la taille et du lait) pour un simple café filtre. Ils semblent cependant avoir embauché des employés bilingues récemment et l'attitude est meilleure.

Bref, l'endroit tiens pour moi davantage de votre chaîne de pâtisserie/boulangerie de quartier que d'un café indépendant. À noter que je n'ai pas essayé les repas complets. Aussi, ceux qui cherchent un endroit où travailler aimeront savoir que le wifi est limité par un code à 2 heures."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this an \"ok\" cause I dont know what else to say...I keep trying to give this place chance after chance in the hopes of being impressed..

The first time I had the roast beef sandwich. I was sorely disappointed. I had to add some home-made mayo to make it semi-acceptable.

The second time I had their grilled cheese sandwiches... As far as grilled cheese goes, this is by far the best in the city, so props for that.

Third time I had the breakfast sandwich. Sad to say, McDonald's has better.

Their coffee was ok. Their orange juice is actually quite delicious. 

It seems to me like the owner couldn't decide whether to open a coffee shop, sandwich shop, and as of recently, a tapas bar. I'll have to go back and see how they do with that."}
{"text":"Update: Jonah James is no more. Rest in Peace to you, sweet candle in the wind. 

Jonah James is the best independent café you'll find in N.D.G. It is in a very central and convenient location; that is to say a short one block away from my apartment. This is the place to be early in the morning this side of Décarie in the Eastern Deeg. When I'm in the mood for a nice, tasty and well-made espresso, cappuccino or cortado I roll out of bed, walk down the back lane way and hustle on down to Jonah James. There is usually a nice little bench and picnic table outside (a tad removed and aside from the seasonal terrace) for patrons to sit, drink their coffee and smoke a cigarette - if you're into that sort of thing. I also implore everyone who sets foot inside this place to please please please indulge me as well as yourself and try the excellent pistachio croissant and / or the pistachio chocolatine. You've never had anything like it I can guarantee. Unless, that is, you've been to the source: ArHoMa. However should you not have the opportunity to hightail it on down to the other side (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve) you can get your fix here. Their sandwiches are excellent as well. The grilled cheese is impeccably made, creatively gourmand and grilled to order! The vegetarian kaiser is scrumptious. Try the French onion soup; it's a meal. That is some hearty soup. Come here for a café and then stay for the bistro. Also, go next door and check out the little general shoppe. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I recently dined on a quiet Wednesday night at this cute bistro with a friend. We were the only ones there and had the most amazing, flavourful meal. I was afraid that the portions would be too small, but they were just right for us (and my friend is usually a big eater). We started off with delicious complementary warm biscuits (2). I tried the soup of the day and my friend tried their famous onion soup. Both were delicious, the mired of flavours just jumping out of the bowl. For our main course, he tried the Beef Bourguignon and I tried the Wild Salmon with mashed potatoes. I tell you this is the first time I can say that the sides were just as wonderful as the main dishes. The meal came to a reasonable $62 with tax (no wine or liquor) and we left with full tummies. HIghly recommend this resto/cafe for dinner. Service was superb by our friendly server Kara. Go, you won't be disappointed. The general store attached to this retro style eatery is also worth a visit."}
{"text":"This cute little Westmount cafe and actually convinced me to try Quinoa again, and this time I didn't mind it at all. (All 5 other times I've tried it, I've hated it)

Walking into the half basement location, it was unsuspectingly cute! There are about 6 tables or so for customers as well as two counter spaces (4 chairs a piece). The server/host/barista was super friendly and courteous. We came on a Sunday and there are different menus for Mon-Fri vs. Saturday and Sunday. I had a fantastic chai latte (with soy milk), it was aromatically delicious, and the poached egg on quinoa and mixed greens. The dressing was zippy and the egg was poached perfectly. I remained skeptical until the 3rd bite and surprised still at how I didn't not like it!

It was pretty busy, with each empty table overturning within minutes, and we stayed for a bit eating, drinking and chatting! Definitely worth coming through!"}
{"text":"So my first impression wasn't great. I waited at the counter for a while, at first enjoying the adorable decor but rapidly getting antsy at the total lack of service. Finally I peeked my head around the corner to the general store side and saw a young handsome barista type with his feet up, on his cell phone. He jumped up to help me, to his credit, and made me an iced latte. I paid and sipped it walking away before I realized it was sweet. I took it back semi-sheepishly saying I had sort of been hoping for just espresso and milk. Without batting an eye he made me another. Two minutes later I heard another customer order an iced latte and this time I heard him say \"the sugar is here if you want to add any.\" I dug this quick adaptation. The cookie I tried was delicious, the airconditionning is welcome and there are all kinds of cute and tasty things I'd come here to try. Definitely a welcome addition to Westmount."}
{"text":"Like the commenter below I was waiting around for the nail place to open and decided to pop in for a coffee and a bite. I ordered a regular coffee and the lady at the counter checks the dispenser and says \"I think it's lukewarm\" and offered me a latte at the same price. Hmm ok thanks but telling a new customer that you think the coffee is lukewarm rather than just making a fresh pot makes no sense to me. I could understand if it was closing time but it wasn't.

I wanted a croissant or muffin. Nothing to choose from, just 1 kind of very plain looking muffins (corn/poppyseed?) and an almond croissant. I ordered the almond croissant, it was nasty. It was crunchy and greasy and oily. Eww. 

Sorry but this place was a disappointment, I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is a super cute independent cafe/restaurant in Westmount.

They've got a yummy menu and the interior is all cute and vintage-y.

It's not a destination place but it's great for lunch or a coffee if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"i loved this place! the uber chic joint came with thick rimmed glasses and with an old school pepsi cola fridge.

bar? cafe? why not both? 

opened up just 4 months ago and the boozie license only 2 months ago, this place does stay open till 10pm on certain nights. non matching plates with cloth striped napkins, everything was hipster worthy.

the small bar area had a counter with slightly rusted red high chairs. the rest of the area were regular table seating with a select few with banquette.  we ordered a hot choco and soy chai latte.  both were served in glass tumblers that were searing hot.  using napkins, we could gingerly clutch our drinks and burn our tongues.

i overheard a patron mention that she comes here often for breakfast. the dinner menu looked promising with fried green tomato,  savory tarts and expected entrees like fried chicken and salmon.

jonah james had a vintage charm found only in jcrew catalogues and upstate new york b&b's

connected to jonah james with a white painted gate, norah was the sweet to the savory.

complete with marsala chai from \"green\" origins, old fashioned taffy bars, and pretty soaps you indulged in as gifts., norah is a veritable retro vignette.
if i were 12, i would be oohing and aahin with omg, too cute! and there i was oohing and aahing shamelessly.

norah was a perfect gift shop for you or a friend for that little something-something that was unique."}
