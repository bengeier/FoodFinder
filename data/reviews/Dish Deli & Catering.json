{"text":"I love Donna Chriszt's food and have always found something delicious to eat whenever I've eaten at Dish.  My favorite is the old standby of turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  Outstanding food everytime.  Donna Chriszt is one of Cleveland's best, but under appreciated chefs."}
{"text":"The other two reviews pretty much said everything, so I don't want to be redundant.  I really liked the hummus sandwich; they had a good selection of breads and I really had a hard time choosing between many tasty-looking spreads and dishes.  The soups always sound appealing too.

The only reason I don't come here more often is because it sort of makes me feel guilty to buy something I could easily make myself.  Not to say that I would make AS good a chicken salad or tapenade or whatever, but I'm willing to try to do something like that, or a soup, at home as opposed to going out for it."}
{"text":"I attempted to eat lunch at Dish Deli today.  Why just an attempt?  I asked about whether or not various items in the deli case were vegetarian and the person working had no idea.  Same for the soups.  \"There might be chicken stock.  I'm not sure.\"  I'd actually heard that this deli was vegetarian friendly, so maybe I just came across the one person who isn't up on what foods are vegetarian and what aren't.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"Pulled pork with mango chutney turnover-- sweet Jeebus, that is art!  I stopped by to grab a quick bite before going vintage shopping I the area.  My lunch was fresh and bursting with flavor!

There is a small counter with a few stools and a few small cafe tables outside, but it seems more of a takeout/ catering place. The staff is really nice and helpful.   I was just about to arder a triple ginger cookie when the baker rushed out and told me to hold on-- she had just taken a new batch out of the oven.  lLter she stopped by my table to discuss what I thought of her new twist on the recipe.  ( Not sweet, not for everyone, but hard core ginger lovers will go crazy for it.)

They are dedicated to using loal farm products.  They even post the names of the farms and the produce of the week outside!"}
{"text":"Dish occupies the space of the old Take-a-Bite Deli right around the corner from Civilization. Most of the business generated is through catering. They have a lot of different take out options because of this. There are a couple of tables if you want to eat in. There are many different great sandwiches to try featuring Boar's Head deli meat products. I find this to be my favorite brand of deli meat. My friend always gets the pork chop and eats it between two pieces of bread. The chicken salad is outstanding. If you want to eat a homemade meal without having to work for it, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"One of our offices is located in this funky neighborhood and I've tried dish on a couple of occassions. The food has always been fresh and really good. The outdoor tables have been wonderful on nice summer days. 

A small deli with a dozen or so premade items in a case, plus they have soups & sandwiches. One thing of note, their fruit salad is excellent. The fruit is really fresh and they add finely diced mint leaves to the fruit. Delicious."}
