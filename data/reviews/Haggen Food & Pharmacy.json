{"text":"I have kept trying and trying to give this place a decent shot but they keep giving me a reason to never, ever go back.  

Tonight I went at 645 PM and the meat and deli counter were already closed?  I mean, WTF? People DO go shopping at 645PM still right?  I asked the cashier and she said \"Well, we are just too slow to keep the meat counter open this late.\"  Seriously?  No wonder why this place is slowly dying. 

The selection here has been gradually getting worse, now no organic chicken, and outside of the closed meat counter their meat selection quite frankly sucks unless you want to buy a bunch of clearly past their prime pre packaged meat some of which is marked down a whopping $3.  Thanks Haggens, enjoy throwing that piece of Kobe beef out instead of discounting it. 

I will be looking forward to this place going out of business but I feel bad for their employees.  It's not their fault the managers are idiots"}
{"text":"This store has an ok floral departmen but here's a hack to get the best arrangements; they keep the fresh flowers in the back store room. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is going out of business. Every since they bought it from Albertsons they have run this store into the ground. They closed the pharmacy permanently today at 5pm. When I came at 4pm to pick up my prescriptions they had already pulled from the shelves and now I don't have my meds.

They are over priced, under stocked and just generally poorly managed. Hopefully they will sell this location to a compent grocery store company."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!

1) We already know you are expensive!  $$$$
2) Expired meats/seafood common.  FOUL!  Beware of the orange labeled markdowns!  They may be past expiration or tainted !  Had to throw mine in the garbage, amount EXCEEDED the REFUND policy. Beware!
3) Produce inconsistent , sometimes fresh sometimes not.  Must inspect closely.
4) Deli?  Closes early  and the staff apologizes because they are behind schedule and how much work it is for one person!  I feel sorry for them! Prepping sandwiches on a cart next to the cooler on the main floor?   Seriously?
5) Purchased pre made sandwiches, found a PIGEON bird feather nestled inside. EWWW!
6) Beware of the hummus with the Haggen label in the \"non\" tamper proof containers! 
7) Roses died in 2 days after purchase!  :-(  
8) Management, why don't you respond to the YELPERS?  
9) Is there a loyalty program in place?  Soon, you will LOSE your customer base if this nonsense continues.
10) Perhaps the SNHD should be notified of the public health issues that are ABUNDANT?"}
{"text":"I'm not very impressed with Haggen. I really miss albertsons when it was there. The prices in the entire store seem to have gone up by a lot which is annoying since it seems like a downgraded the staff there. The only bright sport they have is that they carry thrifty ice cream."}
{"text":"It's just disappointing that a new brand that we are unfamiliar with comes in and changes everything at every location.  Disrupts everyone's norms and expectations and now I hear there are filing for bankruptcy?  What will happen now at all of these locations?  Also, employees here shared with me that were not treated good and were unhappy with the entire transition which makes it hard to support.  We go for groceries but we still want to be recognized, appreciated, etc and if the employees aren't happy that isn't going to happen."}
{"text":"What a joke! Half of the food was expired, way too expensive, and the employees are smoking at the front door as I write this!! No wonder your store is always empty...we definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Update -  Haggen's is closing . Why does this not suprise me. Their prices are ridiculously outrageous."}
{"text":"Went to check it out since last time I saw it was being Albertson's. It was about lunch time so I decided to head for the deli to get a sandwich. They still had some equipment missing (toaster oven) but I got pretty decent sandwich after all. Everything was fresh and tasted good. 

Produce area is really good. I found some good deals on mangoes (1.29 each for organic is not bad at all). Overall not a bad choice for grocery shopping. I wish Haggen's luck in a local market."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, the service and selection has gone down hill dramatically. Rumor has it that Haggen is giving this store up. If so, it shows. It could have been great, but it's clear they are no longer interested in serving customers or providing a decent selection. Couple that with high prices and why should I come back? I hope Von's takes this store back. They were fantastic and know how to run a grocery store."}
{"text":"Really disappointed that Albertson's sold out to Haggen.  The prices are outrageous.  I am looking for a new place to shop for food."}
{"text":"We were never a fan of the old Albertsons that used to be at this location (always very slow service, even when they were not busy, sometimes dirty), so when it changed it Haggen, we were optimistic.

First thing we noticed is the store was cleaner, nicer, but.......the prices were higher.
Not just the new products they stocked but standard items you'd find anywhere else.
Bad decision if you ask me.

Seems that many agreed and also decided not to shop there.
Why pay more for something you can buy for less just across the street or elsewhere in the neighborhood?

The other day, we saw the going out of business sale they have going on now, with items from 10%-30% off. Sorry to say: OK, now we were interested. 

Lo and behold, in typical Haggen fashion, they give discounts on items jacked up in price, to where you can still buy them across the street or elsewhere for less. For example, bottle of grey-label Sterling Merlot, usually around $23.99 or less at Alberstons or Safeway, was priced at $31.99.
Even when we were at the Grand Californian Hotel at Disneyland (known to overprice things), I still got it for $21-$23. Guess Haggen charges several dollars more \"for the Haggen experience\"? Now, the discount was 20% off, so I'd still be paying over $25, and more than what it costs elsewhere. Nice try Haggen!

So, after running into too many overpriced items, we just got what we needed.
When we went to check out, there was a: \"All Sales Are Final\" sign. 

Knowing Haggen's bad representation with pricing/mis-pricing: 
\"UH OH\" came to mind.

FIRST, the BAD:
We got jipped. Got home, audited the receipt (I randomly picked out a few items while we were shopping, those were fine). Got 3 cans of a soup priced at: $2.29/ea, without 20% discount. Per the receipt, they processed the discounts inconsistently, with one off by $0.01, but the 3rd can: we were charged the full price. 
=Haggen FAIL.

Bought 3 frozen meals, priced at $2.69/ea., and they offered 20% off.
They took off $.54/ea. for 2, but the 3rd one? They charged us $3.69, and took off $.74, so we ended up paying $2.95 for that item (more than the listed price!). Why? They rung it up as a \"limited\" edition item --- in which it was not. The limited items are clearly boxed in a special limited packaging with great big words \"LIMITED\" across it and in brown boxes. We bought the standard versions, all in blue boxes, and with nothing \"limited\" stated on it. 
=Another Haggen FAIL.

(What is this? \"Buy 2 Discounted, Get the 3rd at Full, Incorrect Higher Price\" - ?)

I suspect we were overcharged for the sparkling water we got by about $0.50/ea., but am not about to go back to check. This is pocket change, but I think it highlights that Haggen still never fixed their pricing issues.

When is mis-pricing okay? Mistakes happen, but it seems to happen with Haggens too often. Is this their standard operating procedure? It doesn't appear to us that Haggen's took proper pricing, or their consumers, seriously. What excuse do they have to not get these things right? Regardless, if they are going out of business, pricing should still be correct, it stands as a requirement for them.

Posting an \"All Sales Are Final\" sign, and taking into account their history, one gets the impression they are aware of some mis-pricing, and that sign is their protection. If pricing was correct, then why even bother with the sign? 

That we audited our receipt and found we were overcharged, helps support that impression.

Oh, and they do some security theater with you when you check out. 
They opted out of the new card/chip system so the theater is to reassure you.
Their employees seemed to think it was ridiculous too.

THE GOOD THING, was we did get a good deal on air filters. 
Normally about $7.99 to $8.99, they were priced at $6.99, but giving a 30% discount! So I got about for about $5. A pack of six-bottles of Corona Extra, they put at $10,99, but I can get for $8.99 at one of their competitors. However, they were selling Fat Tire for $8.99, but with the 15% discount, they took $1.35 off. So that was pretty good too. (I think we got the last one though).

So there were SOME good deals but to avoid getting ripped off, you have to track all of the list prices, the discounts, do all the math yourself, then at the register, dispute any irregularities before you pay since after you do \"All Sales Are Final\" per their sign. WHO WANTS TO DO THAT? No one, but it seems they are betting on that. 

I feel bad for the employees who will be out of a job since the place is going out of business.
What makes the whole situation worse, is while they go out of business, they still try to pull off shenanigans on the community. Are they angry at us? Giving us one last \"middle finger\" as their ship sinks? Yikes. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Haggen it's new in Vegas 
I like it 
The best super market 
In town !!!"}
{"text":"I miss Vons!  The prices are exorbitant (in some cases, almost 100% more than some stores - Grape Nuts at $4.49, whereas Nutty Nuggets at Smiths is $2.29; 40 calorie Popsicles are $1.99, whereas at Smith's they're $1.00 or $1.25 depending on the week).  I'll never go back. Instead, I now to go to Von's on Durango and Desert Inn as part of the shopping routine.  So, Goodbye Haggen and Hello Hassle."}
{"text":"Summerlin, Las Vegas is a sophisticated community with lots of sizzle, competition, and grocery store options. Haggens is extremely disappointing. Having shopped in the Trails for over 13 years, I really was shocked by the obvious lack of homework done by the Haggens transition team. 

1) More expensive - no comparative pricing! Much more expensive than Vons. If I want to pay more for specialty items or organic, I'd go to Whole Foods, Trader Joes, or Sprouts - all of which has more ambiance. personality, and warmth. Do your homework Haggens! See what pricing Smith's, Walmart and Albertson's are offering for key grocery staples. Vons was a neighborhood grocery store. Haggens as it opened is not. 

2). No community interaction! When you open a store with new brands and product, it is critical to develop relationships. A few Interactions with the customers through sampling would go far to connect Haggen's new brands with a new community. 

3) Limited choices! I found many of my favorite national brands had reduced shelf real estate and I couldn't find favorite product - (including Oikos chocolate strawberry/raspberry yogurt.) (I understand why Vons/Safeway products would not be there... but replace like for like.) 

4) No suggestion card at the cash register or question from the cashier... Did you find what you were looking for? 

5) Sterile non-energetic ambiance. While bright and clean are good qualities, the new store seemed anemic and bare. Even the new piped in 'mu-sack' was a yawner.

I was really looking forward to a bright new neighborhood grocery store which Haggens is not....at least not yet. So our family did something they haven't done since we moved to Las Vegas. We drove 5 minutes out of our way and went to Smith's."}
{"text":"All i can say is wow! The only reason to go here is to go to the Starbucks! Otherwise drive 5 minutes the other way and hit Smiths for better prices! Extremely over priced for EVERYTHING! I would rather deal with all the senior citizens and crazy parking lot at smiths then shop way overpriced food! This is the only place to grab one item if your in a binned. Otherwise stay away!!!!  My entire family as well as neighborhood all started going to smiths now. This place is horrible! Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I will make this short & sweet as all the other negative reviews represent my opinion and more.  I have gone to the Von's store for 13 yrs, live nearby the Village Center Store and wanted this to be a great improvement over Von's, however, am very disappointed, the place is now like a ghost town, prices are too much to swallow, and every time I go back, no one is shopping there anymore.....all my friends are now going elsewhere, and unfortunately I will be doing the same...yes, if I could give 0 stars, I would"}
{"text":"Poor service, and it's basically Vons but way too expensive. $6 per POUND of chicken breast, seriously?!"}
{"text":"If you want bad meat and horrible customer service your at the right place! Avoid this place if possible"}
{"text":"I agree, bring back Albertsons. You can tell Haggen is going through troubled times. Less product on the shelves, especially the fish and bakery counters. Prices are still too high. The good thing is empty isles and quick checkout. I am sure at this rate there will be more than the 27 stores that have already been closed. It is obvious the company does not know the consumer base they are trying to attract."}
{"text":"The CEO Needs to Go !!!!! He is an Incompetent Buffoon he has absolutely no clue how a business works. A successful business will try to appeal to a new customer by having low to competitive prices especially as a new business in a community. That business would try to entice customers to come in and try their custom foods and try to keep them as loyal customers. Now what Bill Shaner the CFO for Haggen Supermarket did was the Complete Opposite !!!! He closed the former stores down Jacked all the prices up overnight sometimes by 200% reopened the stores 48 hours later under the Haggen Supermarket name and basically tried to greedily gouge every customer @ the checkout and ran that franchise into the ground in a matter of weeks not to mention the thousands of families lives that he affect in ways this Imbecile could care less about including those that are having babies and others that depended on medical coverage to help in their fight against cancer. Good Job Bill Shaner I must say you have got to be one of the stupidest business men in the world or you were sent in to destroy this company on purpose but either way you should have been the First to be let go !!!!! Boycott This Franchise until they get rid of the Executives that destroyed so many working class peoples Lives !!!!!"}
{"text":"Haggen bought my local location of Albertsons brand stores. I was worried at first because I'm not big on change but I tried to stay open minded. I was a little at ease once I heard that the employees of Albertsons were assured that their jobs and schedules were safe. Haggen opened and I went. It was nice. They seem to be big on organics which was nice. Well then everything went south. Employees lost hours and jobs and the store was half stocked at best most of the time. Now they're closing. I haven't had enough of an experience with Haggen to judge them as a company. But I do know that the timeline of events at my local store were unnerving. To buy out Albertsons just to close it is fine in itself. Not ideal it fine. However, to promise people who's livelihoods were at stake that they would be fine just to close the store with no reason is ridiculous. F*ck Haggen."}
{"text":"Like others, I miss the old Vons. It's more expensive on most items, fewer store brands, and the selection isn't better. This Vons was my go-to grocery, and I'm sorry for the old employees, but I am going to start shopping elsewhere. In fact it's exactly like the layout of Vons with less selection and higher prices."}
{"text":"I agree that the prices are ridiculous and only go now to pharmacy only because I like the employees but they are some days struggling with the restrictions.  Can't even get a shingles shot now.  Extremely disappointed and loved Von's."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a new business to AZ would come in and act so arrogant to customers.  I enjoyed Albertsons.  Their liquor/alcohol pricing was absolutely unbeatable.  Deli meats selection was large and priced great.  Even seafood/meat and produce were priced fairly low.  And their \"Everyday Essentials\" brand was cheaper than Kroger brand.

Well, that a changed when Haggen came in.  I usually spent $150 a week in groceries.  My FIRST trip after the change and I spent over $200.  I thought maybe I bought some extra things so went back the following week...  Over $200 again.  I started checking prices and was blown away.

I sent an email to their corporate office specifically noting what the price was and is on dry good and liquor items.  Their response was \"We constantly shop competitors to ensure fair and even better pricing\".  I have no idea where they are shopping...  Maybe AJ's?

I have since switched over to Safeway across the street.  My weekly grocery bills dropped back down to around $150, which I am very happy with.  Since Albertsons has bought/merged with Safeway, I don't feel too bad about switching."}
{"text":"Actually would score it 0 stars but unable to on site.  Was a Vons's shopper 1-2 times/wk. since it opened in the Trails but will no longer shop at the new Haggen unless it is a dire emergency since I live just up the street.  Prices are about 1/3 higher than Vons & other competitors, sale items in advertised flyers are merely higher or regular prices elsewhere, bakery items are scarce & look dry & unappealing besides being pricier, produce & bakery has all been significantly reduced & sparse, everything else looks similar with brighter lighting and MUCH higher prices, less selection and poor customer service despite several employees just hanging around the service desk talking & laughing with each other.  I had asked for a raincheck for the single item I came in for & it was a major ordeal for the manager to issue it despite them being out of it.  No grand opening \"hoopla\"or anything to welcome customers to its new stores in new communities.  What a total disappointment!  Will be counting the days, along with everyone I know who used to shop at Vons & has been to Haggen, until the store is hopefully acquired again by a company that cares about the shopping experience, competitiveness and its customers.  Haggen has now lost many loyal Von's customers and the Smith aisles are \"bumper\"carts where \"customer service\" reigns supreme!"}
{"text":"Went into this store for the fourth time since the changeover from Albertson's, had three gallons of two percent milk available but all were expired. I could see some in the back wrapped up so because I couldn't find anyone there to help I asked at checkout for two gallons and was told \"All the milk is expired, we should have some tomorrow\"...I'm sorry but for a store boasting about \"No hassles\", having to now drive to the next nearest grocery store 6 miles away is kind of a hassle. Not a fan, wish we had the Albertson's back in our neighborhood. Good news was that it was a ghost town, so maybe they won't be here very long!"}
{"text":"I love this store!  Only giving 4 stars cause I can't use my Von's club card anymore. But hey- pick your own six pack!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and this was a nice quaint store. Checkers were friendly and produce guy was helpful"}
{"text":"I really tried to like this new store but I've been coming for a month and it just keeps getting worse.   Most of the products that I really liked when it was Vons are now gone.   No fresh gluten-free bread.  Very limited selection in the frozen case.   Tonight I went in for my favorite organic popcorn.   Nope.  Don't carry it anymore.   Whole shelf is microwave everything.   Something I bought today was about $2 more per bottle than what I was charged by Vons.  The prices are outrageous.   The produce was good at first but has seriously declined in quality and quantity.   

I'll be going back to Whole Foods and looking to see if there are any Vons stores left in Las Vegas and how far I'll have to travel to get to one."}
{"text":"I've been shopping at Von's at the Trails Center, Summerlin since it opened and most often very much enjoyed my shopping experience. I can only say that in my opinion and experience that the prices overall at Haggen are SUBSTANTIALLY more expensive compared to that of Von's as well as competing area stores, and without any noticeable difference to me in terms of the quality or the atmosphere within the store itself, although the store in fact appears to me to be more barren and deserted.

Mostly, I am referring to brand name products where from my perspective Haggen has ridiculously raised prices dramatically. In my opinion this store cannot even be compared to many of the higher end and specialty markets in Las Vegas where I would now prefer to shop if I must pay Haggen prices.

Furthermore, Haggen seems not to be stocking many of the items that I had enjoyed and have become accustomed to purchasing over the years; I sincerely doubt that this store will thrive in our community if it continues in my opinion with an extremely outrageous pricing policy. They have lost this customer despite it being a convenient location in which to shop. I reiterate that I am totally shocked by their prices! Their staff is as nice and as kind as always, virtually the same Von's employees, but I can somewhat sense the staff's own dismay and perhaps disappointment at the lack of traffic and the new Haggen pricing as well.

Additionally, I am discouraged that I have not seen a response from the Haggen management team to many of the online negative reviews. Perhaps they are not concerned despite the fact that they still have an opportunity to make this a great store and win back the loyal Von's customer and neighborhood consumer."}
{"text":"What a disaster. Now the pharmacy is gone. Prices are sky high. Lack of inventory in certain departments. Only one checkout is open during the day time hours. I used to love Vons.

Now company in chapter 11 so that everybody that is owed money gets screwed. I hate people that declare bankruptcy, hurting those honest people that had faith in them. Avoid them."}
{"text":"Was unpleasantly surprised when I visited my Von's supermarket and discovered  it had been taken over by Haggen.  I hated the new store the minute I stepped foot inside.  They destroyed the floral department that I loved by removing all of the beautiful floral arrangements that Vons had sold.  Nearly all of the items I went to Vons specifically for, were gone.  My family loved Vons baked brownies which have been eliminated and replaced by some nasty little round things that tasted terrible.  No more discounts and my bill was $70 more than I normally spent at Vons for the same type of products.   Btw...all of the organic meat selections were gone and the organic produce, which didn't even include organic flat leaf parsley, looked exactly like the non-organic produce  with an organic sticker on it, which raised my suspicions.  I will not be returning to this nasty store.  Will have to go to Sprouts and Smiths from now on."}
{"text":"Hate, hate, hate this store.  I am so upset that Haggen grocery store took over all of the Vons stores in my neighborhood.  The prices are astronomical, the selection is horrible and many of the items I went specifically to Vons to buy are gone.  I was forced to go to Haggen today as I was running late to a dinner party and it was the nearest grocery store.  I went in to buy a couple of bottles of wine to take to give to the hostess and prices were insane, $54.00 for a bottle of mediocre California cabernet.  Then I discovered they had no gift bags to fit a wine bottle.  Vons used to have gift bags and tags and ribbons right in the alcohol section, which was convenient and made sense.  No such luck with Haggen, they had removed the gift bags from the liquor section and had no bags to fit a bottle of wine in their cards and gift wrap section.  I had to go to another store!!  I will never return to this horrible store."}
{"text":"They basically changed the sign and raised the prices. Produce is horrendous. If you're gonna charge 3x the price for produce it should at least be twice as good as your competition. Seafood section is much better since the takeover but more expensive then whole foods."}
{"text":"The prices are ridiculously higher! Not much variety on the shelves.  Have now switched to Smith's which is ultimately the winner. I will only shop here if I need to pick up 1 or 2 things.  Can't wait until it either goes belly up or is purchased by a chain who is not looking to rip off the customer. Kroger, look into purchasing this location, you will make even more of a killing in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"One star is too high.
I've shopped at Von's at The Trails in Summerlin since it opened.....spent thousands and thousands of dollars there over the years.  It's only a few blocks from my house.  Then Haggens comes in June....high prices, many of my favorite items discontinued, and produce that's rock hard.  Long-time employees say it will get better, so I wait.  Most of my neighbors quit shopping there during the summer.
So, recently, the shelves are almost bare.  But, today, I go in and it's the last straw....there's no bread....NO bread!  Maybe half a dozen loafs and couple packages of buns.  When questioned, the girl in the department says they're just waiting for a bread truck.  Another gentleman and I laugh and comment that this is crazy.....there's hardly anything in the whole store!  She responds rudely so I decide to speak to a manager.
I wait and I wait, and I wait......Cory is called 3 times and is in the back of the store.....can't be bothered to come to the front and talk to me, so I leave.  This is the same Cory who was offended when I suggested they have someone working in the meat department on Saturdays so people could get meat from the meat counter.
The most disappointing thing was that long time employees, whom I've known for years, did not seem to care that the store's condition was so unacceptable....Cory certainly didn't care if he lost a long-time customer.  
I left and drove to Smith's.....I won't step foot in that store again."}
{"text":"Green meat....check!  Moldy cheese.....yes! Looking for bad smelling seafood dept? They have that too! Expired items....yes!! Damaged veggies and fruit....why not! Smashed eggs....bingo!! Funny that Haggen is complaining they are not getting shoppers.....well, when shoppers are actually LOOKING to buy all the above.......you will be well on your way to the top! Until then......suing in court can't change what the consumer sees in your stores."}
{"text":"Seems more expensive than Von's.  I like the unique things, but this used to be my daily grocery store for the basics every week."}
{"text":"Warning: Check expiration dates.  I was so surprised to see lowfat Anderson Dairy milk on sale 3 days past its expiration date.  The nonfat was due to expire tomorrow.  There was not any fresher milk hiding behind it, either.
When I mentioned it to the clerk checking me out, she was well aware of it and very apologetic.  She said they were short staffed.  Really?  So short staffed for 3 days you can't take 10 minutes to grab a cart and pull the milk?  How fresh is your seafood?  Or your meat?
What about the poor fool that doesn't check expiration dates?  Are you knowingly selling expired product to your customers?  Yuck - huge turnoff."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the first time thinking it was still Albertsons. I couldn't figure out what was wrong, why I couldn't find all of my usual favorite things that I go to Albertsons specifically for. Produce was a disappointment. Coffee department was a disappointment. Packaged meat section was a disappointment. Fresh seafood was a disappointment. And I couldn't get over how high the prices were on many of the items I checked. It was only as I was checking out that I found out from the clerk that I was in Heggins, not Albertsons any longer. That will be my last trip to this particular grocery chain. I can't imagine how they will ever compete with the Frys, Bashas, Safeway, Sprouts, and AJ's that are all nearby and provide better pricing, a better selection and/or higher quality."}
{"text":"I have visited a few times, but would rather go to the Fry's just a few minutes away. They are definitely overpriced for almost everything. I understand it is supposed to be specialty, but it used to be a Safeway so they should have slowly increased the prices. If you are hoping to visit the customer service desk, you will not find an employee working it, ever. I waited 5 mins, then realized no one was coming and no one would call someone over to the desk so I abandoned that. The next time I visited, same thing. Apparently they don't feel it is necessary to have someone at the desk during the day (12p-2p).
 On the plus side, their cakes are GREAT. They are much better than the store bought cakes you usually get. We have purchased a few cakes there (at least 4) and each has been nothing but amazing. I would definitely not do my regular shopping there but I would go for the one off situation."}
{"text":"This is the worst supermarket I have Ever set foot in! High prices, bad service , moldy fruit and vegetables, expired products. I want Von's back! Won't set foot in a Haggens again!"}
{"text":"I am dissapointed and will not be shopping at Haggens. I now shop at Fry's. Items under $5 are .50 more, items between $5-$10 are $1 more and those over $10 are $2-$5 more, including their deli meats. Sliced chicken breast was $11.99 per pound at the deli. Their liquor department is a ripoff too. The use by date on a gallon of milk is 2 days away. I've gone to this store a few times and each time there are fewer shoppers.  There won't be any turnover on their produce and meats because people quickly decided to go elsewhere and with good reason.  I feel bad for their employees who formerly worked for Albeertson's."}
{"text":"OUCH! Will never go back to Haggen for any of our grocery needs. I counted 20 or more higher standard posters around the store but I don't see any higher standards. More like a downgrade from VONS.  The entire meat section was brown meat with stickers that have managers special because it's ready to expire... WOW!  I approve this message JKKUHL.."}
{"text":"I was craving guacamole, so I thought I would try Haggen's since they are more of a specialty store. Yes, they specialize in not having any guacamole. I had to walk the length of the store 3 times before I found someone to ask. Disappointing...won't be back any time soon."}

{"text":"One star is being generous. This store has a very limited selection in most of their departments. The only saving factor would be their produce, if you don't mind paying ridiculously high prices. At least 30% higher then when it was a Vons. I asked the Manager on-duty, (I want to say his name was Doug), if he could get back a product was was no longer available after the change from Vons, and he promised to look into it, but 6 weeks later...nothing. 

To bad that in an upscale neighborhood such as Summerlin, we have such a substandard store as Haggen. It's worth the drive to Alberstsons at Charleston/Town Center."}
{"text":"I once read an article saying if you can smell the seafood in a store that then the seafood is not fresh. Higgins has an excellent meat and seafood counter. Their meat is much better than AJ's and more reasonably priced. But you are buying quality so you can expect to pay for it. It is one of the few places I can buy fresh lamb. I buy my meat and seafood at Hagan also love the pharmacy. I buy my canned goods cat food and cleaning supplies at Walmart and Sam's. When I shop at Hagan I am always afraid that it will close because It usually is not busy."}
{"text":"Over priced! & cutting your employees should probably show you guys aren't making any money. Lower the prices!"}
{"text":"This store is CRAZILY overpriced. I was a loyal Albertson's shopper, but now I've switched to the Safeway across the street. I was there at 5 PM on a Friday evening and the place was near empty. I can't imagine this chain surviving in Arizona without drastic changes."}
{"text":"I've not shopped at this particular store but I am a former frequenter of Haggen from the Pacific Northwest. Love them. They were actually a good mix between say Sprouts & Trader Joe's. I hope they make it in this market. They were my go to store as they had Whole Foods quality but not the price. 

Try them."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Haggen.  After all, the same wonderful employees are there.  People count as much or more than \"places,\" right?  But the atmosphere is sterile, the prices are higher, and the Von's bakery I adored now hangs its baked bagels on a hook or rod.  I found out those very bagels are too \"hard\" also.  Maybe that's from them being on a hook, or maybe that's a new Haggen recipe.  So that's a negative change.  Before, I truly was grateful for Von's Just4U which enabled me to shop online and pre-select items before going into the store.  I truly was grateful for the gas rewards.  Haggen does not have either and I believe their prices overall are higher than Von's or other competing stores.  So I only go there now out of sheer convenience, and the closest remaining Von's stores in Las Vegas are not close to me at all.  Well, there is always change in life, and I always am critical of myself for not accepting some of it---but I wish my little Von's store had not gone away."}
{"text":"I am not surprised Haggen's had possibly the shortest life span of any grocery store chain I have ever seen. 

I will say that for Going Out Of Business (GOOB) prices are still about 20% higher than Whole Foods - and Whole Foods has ORGANIC.

It is crazy to think that Haggens GOOB prices are this bad. A box of Quaker GO-ed out granola bars are more expensive than Whole Foods ORGANIC granola bars.!

Grapes are $2.99/lb for ORGANIC grapes at Whole Foods. Haggens GOOB price for green NON-ORGANIC grapes - WITH the 10% discount - $3.59/lb.

When going into the store with GOOB sales, I at least expected to walk out with a few decent deals. I walked out empty-handed and saved money by going down the street to Smith's - and stopping at Whole Foods for a few organic-only necessities.

It has been made public that Haggen's is suing Albertsons to get their money back from this purchase. If it was me, I could not see raising pricing from buying stores with already the highest prices (Vons) and raising prices 27% would be Albertsons fault.The prices were priced out as though we live in Alaska and a 3 1/2 hour trip was needed to go grocery shopping. Las Vegas is not a remote area where price gouging is acceptable. Maybe Haggen's was for the 1%ers out there - but the 99% of the population will price search and look for quality.

If the prices were SLIGHTLY higher, but competitive and had a lot more organic choices, I could understand. THIS was price gouging. Going out of business prices should not be more than the regular price of Whole Foods.

I personally hope Haggen's management rots in a sack. Very poor management."}
{"text":"I've only ever watched one episode of the Walking Dead, but I imagine the whole series is basically like this store: virtually empty, save for a few dead-eyed folks (employees) walking around aimlessly, and never once greeting me, let alone asking if I need help finding anything. 

Clearly no one in charge here has ever heard of the concept of \"competitive pricing.\" Everything is easily a buck more than it should be, if not double the price. If you're lucky though, you might find those bright orange \"$1 Manager Markdown!\" stickers- except they're only on the truly ridiculous items, like $8 acai juice and borderline-rotten meat.

This place wasn't exactly a hotspot of business when it was Von's, but at least the employees were reliably friendly and the pricing was on par with other places in town. Haggen has nothing going for it whatsoever. I'll take the under on this place making the 6-month mark."}
{"text":"I guess i would call Haggen bad and sad.  I live close to this store, and while I liked Albertons, I go to others in the area as well.  When this became Haggen, the food in 95% of the cases is exactly is the same, but the prices soared. i used to stop at Albertson's for a few items, but at Haggens many prices are so ridiculous, I just pass it by most times now. When I am there the store is dead, and i never seeing anyone buy more than a few items.  

The good news, at least for me, is with so few customers, this store likely won't be here for very long. With any luck Sprouts or Trader Joes will buy the place. 

Overall, food is Albertson's quality, which isn't bad, but prices are way out-of-wack.

Looks like they now leaving AZ. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."}
{"text":"One month later and  past visit was a bit disappointing. Not much produce selection, for the most part it's all fresh,but majority was a. 50 to one dollar more than the specialty grocery store I shop at.  Bread aisle looking pretty sad though.  They spread out the merchandise to make it appear full. Either they sell out of some products quick or haven't been restocking.  I haven't seen my favorite Thrifty Ice Cream flavor since last month now. And they raised the price on that too!

Oh and they cut the store hours waaay back.  7:30 pm everyday is what the check out clerk told me. Employees are helpful and remain upbeat despite the growing pains of this new chain.  Hope it's temporary because it's my go to place for my Thrifty Ice Cream fix."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it was a Vons - reasonable quality at reasonable prices. This place charges Whole Foods prices without the same quality. I have to be careful what I grab at this store because the most unexpected things will be way overpriced and I don't notice until I look at my receipt. I will not be shopping here any longer."}
{"text":"I went to college in Bellingham Washington where haggen is from.  I have missed this grocery store ever since!  I love how they highlight local products,  but they have a great selection too.  The deli and hot food are to die for!  So fresh and tasty!  Their prices are competitive and they have a huge organic selection.  They have only been open a few weeks now,  and I think are still transitioning from the vons. I believe one they get rid of the old vons inventory they can make room for more tasty haggen goodness!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment.  Less selection and 20% higher prices than the Albertsons it replaced.  Could not help but notice that none of the employees were smiling."}
{"text":"I've only been in a few times, because it's hard to disassociate that location with Vons.  I never cared for Vons- the Vons produce was generally horrid and the Vons check-out lanes were always backed up and slow.  Well, I went back to Haggen yesterday, and the produce stocker proactively asked if he could help me find something - I was never asked that when it was a Vons.  And, the Haggen brands of cheese and ice cream have been pretty good.  The selection of craft beer is better, and so is the selection and overall quality of produce.  And, the checkout lanes have been faster every time I've been in there.

I'm not sure if Haggen has clearly defined its place in the market; it's supposed to be better quality and service than Vons/Smiths/Albertsons, and thus higher prices on some items.  But, they're not striving to be a Whole Foods. 

Will I buy everything here?  Probably not, but I never have given all my grocery business to one store. There are some good deals to find here, and for the over-priced items, I don't mind driving 5-10 minutes to shop for them.  And, I realize that you can't transform an entire philosophy in 2 days, or 2 weeks or 2 months.  The transition is a process.  There are already a few areas where I see Haggen as an upgrade over Vons, and I anticipate continued improvement over time."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! I'd like my Von's back please. Almost everything in the store is priced more than the old Von's prices. Service is slow and, as other reviewers have said, the employees don't seem to be happy to be working there at all. I'm generally not a \"complainer,\" but I've given them 5-6 chances and I still remain unimpressed. Unfortunately, I'll have to plan ahead better and go to Smith's or Sprouts, because at this point I can't see any reason to return to Haggen unless it is an emergency. Sorry to let my local grocery store go, but VERY poor showing."}
{"text":"I see no reason to ever come back here. Never heard of the chain until receiving a flier in the mail. Thought I'd check it out on a Saturday when I had time, and I'm glad I did... So I'll know never to go back here! It's not that it's a bad place, it's just that there was nothing special to it, and the prices were a little higher than where I regularly shop. The seafood department was nice, had some great stuff in stock. That, I will give them. Other than that, I'll pass."}
{"text":"There is not much to add about their overpricing.  The word is out all around Summerlin that this store is to be avoided.  The part that is disheartening is that they have such a nice location and potential.

The fact their management has not responded to the reviews here, or the fact that the store is a ghost town does not bode well for the immediate future."}
{"text":"Bring back our Albertson's! Constantly empty shelves (they didn't pay their distributors), less selection, higher prices. They've only been here a few months and are already going out of business?!!! I feel so bad for the long-time employees there."}
{"text":"I was really hoping the recent change from Albertons to Haggen at this location would be a positive one, however, I left very disappointed. The prices got much worse, almost ever fruit, peaches, plums, etc, were all priced at $3.99 per pound, the ground beef was nearly $6.00 per pound and milk was well over $4.00 per gallon. I really wanted another choice for a grocery store but sadly for me that did not happen."}
{"text":"The only thing this store has going for it is the employees. They are very helpful and friendly and not the fake friendly, they are genuinely nice. 
But we have to shop at 2 Haggen stores to find the items we regularly buy. At this particular location we like to buy the fresh baked sunflower honey loaf at the bakery (so delicious), the store on Lake Mead in Henderson has the layered bean dip we like, they each never have both. I've asked at this store about the bean dip and the deli girl walked over to see if it was there, it was not,  she went to the back to ask about it and came out looking embarrassed and told me that they hadn't made any today and basically said it was a hit or miss if they got around to it. They never get around to it because it's never there.

I've also shopped at the store in Boulder City and it has neither the bread or the dip among other things. The shelves there are also bare, the deli items are dried out and look inedible, I'm guessing not enough shoppers.Sad.   

My point is where the heck is the consistency? 
 
I love the concept of this store but can't be going to several different locations to buy the stuff we enjoy."}
{"text":"I feel like this place changed overnight. I was out of town for a week and when I came back, Vons was gone and Haggen took it's place. I stopped in one night after work to get something to make for dinner. The store itself is gloomy and drab. It almost feels dark in there. The prices are ridiculous and not in a good way. The 2 employees that were working the cash register at 6pm on a weeknight were slow and unenthused. I will make the drive to Smith's or even Fresh and Easy just to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Well, I received a $25 Haggen gift card for the cooked and feathered hot wings that I reported to their corporate office a week ago, so I thought I would try another location since I was not far. Happy to say that they changed chicken suppliers. No chicken with feathers found. However, I did find molded, allegedly fresh, strawberries and fat free organic expired milk (multiple cartons). Today is 9/9/15 & the cartons were 2 outdated days! My observed shortcomings were reported to a manager who said nothing more than, \"I will tell my floor magers.\" #HelloCorporateAgain! It's you friendly & faithful shopper!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up deli wings for a meal for unexpected guests. After spedning a big amount for convenience sake, I found that most of their chicken: grilled, friend whole pieces and all the wing pieces have many feathers and quills. This is so disgusting! I went there today for fresh fruit and found the same, may e worse. Some have quills 2 inches long and obvious feathers all over. I informed the deli manager, but she says that's what they get from their supplier. I asked her to call the store manager, but that person was gone for the day. Buy with caution. I'm not a chicken plucker! I will follow up with the store manager."}
{"text":"Haggens is a company, that believes in growth, potential. The Haggens company from Pacific Northwest is based in Washington state also CEO of Starbucks...Originally a Mom and Pops type business they were bought out...of course for monetary purpose. However with new management, they decided to expand out of their comfort zone, which is a great thing! However, they did it so quick. They bought a lot of Albertsons and Vons in Nevada and California. They bought a lot so fast at a short time, that they went bankrupt and have to close a lot of stores down. So within months, they were already a failure waiting to happen. The location at this place used to be Vons. Prices were already higher than leading competition such as Smiths & Albertsons, but to add insult with the buy out...Haggens did not key into saving consumers and customer satisfaction.  Vons had high prices but kept value all around and kept customers still shopping. Haggens was greedy and wanted more. Now management is just as important, but am sure corporate had much more to do with the failure of this grocery chain to thrive in such a beautiful heart location of Summerlin. Recently the store is closing down shop. It is sad to see it fail, but it was brought on themselves. Hope they bring back Vons or even better a smiths or Albertsons."}
{"text":"has gone down hill really bad. only one lane open. areas empty not replenished. more expensive. done shopping here.  Miss Albertsons. $3.88 for 2 peaches. really? not even organic."}
{"text":"The prices are ridiculous. $5.69 for my kids Cascadian farm granola bars? They are $2 and change at smiths and were $3 and change at Von's. Mango slices for $9.99?? Berries had that white moldy stuff in a day. Not impressed at all. The worst is the bakery. What are those soggy dense circles in the rack- bagels? Seriously? The worst. I like the deli meat but again so expensive. My bill has gone up, I miss the old faces (but happy they kept the nice manager), and the workers seem miserable. So do the 3 customers. Sad. Haggens is a hassle. I miss Von's. 2 stars cause I like having a neighborhood grocery store. Just not this one."}
{"text":"one of the worst grocery chains to enter are valley. Prices suck inventory always out of everything meats chips. Only thing going for them is clean store but that's from no customers. Carts are always in the yard not in entry. Lots of employees around doing nothing. Can't wait till they sell we need a store that isn't a dump like smith's down the street but has decent prices and inventory."}
{"text":"Yea prices are a little higher but so is the quality the people who are complaining about prices don't care about quality.  I do. Haggen is so much better than Albertsons and people will soon realize that when Albertsons has the monopoly of bouldercity"}
{"text":"Yesterday evening came into store to get fried chicken. It was dinner time and they out only had a couple pieces of fried chicken. They did dropped some more but had to wait 15 minutes. I walked around and was amazed at the high prices?  Wife says she will not shop will at this store will go to Von's or Walmart due to prices. I noticed the sale prices were most of time regular price?? Positive note is you can park close to door because no one in shopping in the store and no lines at checkout.  Deli personal were VERY helpful thank you."}
{"text":"When it changed from vons to haggens I didn't even notice when I walked in except the prices were higher and there was less staff. I've found moldy produce, produce priced higher than whole foods, and had to wait a long time for someone to show up at the meat counter. Not happy with the change.... I see a lot less shoppers in the store and a big drop in how many employees they have working at any given time. 
I'm changing where I do my shopping."}
{"text":"I miss the old vons! This place is more expensive and their steaks are horrible. The steaks are supposed to be USDA Prime but definitely don't taste like they are. They're tough and very overpriced"}
{"text":"This company has entered into the Las Vegas food market and I personally think they have badly judged the market.  They seem to want to be thought of as a cross between a convenience market and a whole foods.  They are neither.

Their pricing is high, much higher than Albertsons and Smiths.  The produce we have had so far is not up to Whole Foods quality but they seem to charge on par with them.  I went looking for advertised shrimp on sale.  They didn't have what was advertised but had something called \"brown shrimp\" of the same size for even less.  I bought it as recommended by the guy at the counter saying it was even better shrimp, time will tell.  no sign of the product they advertised.

I am searching for a reason to shop here.  Well something other than that the store was empty at 1:30pm on a thursday.

I find the employees friendly but I even saw places where you couldn't figure out the price of an item so I didn't even consider buying it.

I know they are new but they say they have been in business for over 80 years, they should have a better handle on all of this.

If they don't lower their prices, we will not be shopping there much."}
{"text":"I love this store.  People need to get over the fact they are no longer Vons. When it was Vons the seafood case smelt so bad I wouldn't take a chance on buying any. Now...amazing. I just bought some salmon that was out of this world.  The employees make this store. Always friendly and helpful even when they have a customer be flat out rude to them. Do people really think a company can take over a business in a couple days and have it be perfect from day one. This store has my vote, and I will continue shopping there."}
{"text":"I miss the Albertsons!!! WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!! I've had to run there one or twice to get milk only to walk into an EMPTY grocery story! All the employees who use to work at Albertsons who now work at Haggens are truly so special. Steve, Lydia, everyone! I feel bad that they have to deal with an over priced store that really has NO \"special\" features. I know so many families who use to shop at Albertsons but now have moved on to Fry's or to Safeway across the street. We moved over to Safeway which is now busy like CRAZY!!!!

Bottom line, families DO NOT want to pay for items we know we can get for cheaper across the street at Safeway. If we want organic, we go to Sprouts less then 3 miles away.

Haggen's not sure why you decided to do this but seeing the EMPTY store shows that you are doing something VERY wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"They should never have done a multi-phase opening. I can't think of any better way to damage a brand. Especially in such a small town. I went in during the first week, and there were tons of Safeway brand items on the shelves. It looked like a gutted Safeway with a few new brands scattered about. I found items that I had recently purchased when it was Safeway with prices raised as much as 25%.  My expectations for a lovely shopping experience were squashed. I will try it one more time at some point - but no one here needs AJ prices with the looks of a Food for Less. We'll just go to Fry's or down to Phoenix. Bummed. Thought Anthem might actually have gotten something good for a change."}
{"text":"Giving 1 star for a decent deli section and that's about it.  There's usually only one cashier and always people waiting and everything is over priced .  I can find beer cheaper at the gas station which is pretty crazy when I'm shopping at a big grocery store.  Customer service also sucks, i'm pretty sure the only reason why people shop here is out of pure convenience because it's in a good location. Thanks for ripping everyone off Haggen.  r.I.P albertsons"}
{"text":"We used to shop at Haggen in Bellingham, WA during the summer.  Loved that store so we were anxious for them to come here.  What a disappointment and disaster that turned out to be.  Mgt., you had the very best manager and staff in the area, best pharmacy, best location, best facility, and you have messed it up.  Whoever your leadership team is should be fired.  Don't assume every market is identical.  Shop the market, study the market, and then decide how to fit in.  In spite of the wonderful staff, of whom many have been laid off, we are Safeway people now, just across the street.  I understand why you are closing many stores in CA & AZ and I'm afraid you will be closing more.  Get someone at the top that knows business and marketing practices and not just food.  As an example, when I asked about a card for discounts,(which I had from WA), the clerk said \"we don't offer discounts\".  Other employees said, \"they tell us we have better products and don't have to have low prices\".  What an instruction to give these people who know more about what they are doing than your District or Regional or CEO or whatever you call them.  Sorry, folks, I'm afraid we'll be reading of your own bankruptcy soon, and you deserve it."}
{"text":"Haggen is on Boulder Hwy in Henderson NV and prices their products like Whole Foods in Beverly Hills.  I don't know who wants to pay 50% to 100% more per item and I am sure there aren't enough to keep this store in business.  Look for the closing before the end of the year.  Too bad because we need a high end grocery store in this part of town.  Somehow, Haggen thought high end meant trick the customers into thinking that Hunts Tomato Paste at Haggen is worth double the price of Hunts Tomato Paste at Vons or Smiths."}
{"text":"Sprouts, are you listening?? Come to Boulder City!! Haggen's was a good idea but unfortunately prices too high. Sprouts would be a nice companion to Albertsons, would give Boulder City some variety. Just sayin' ..."}
{"text":"This store leaves a lot to be desired!!!!  I can see why it's empty everytime I come in here.  Always ONE cashier!  I've tried to give this place a chance 4 times now!  EVERY SINGLE TIME they tried to over charge me for something!!!!!!!  And that also happened to me twice at the location in Boulder City!  Their prices are outrageous!  I bought a pound of potato salad that cost $4.99 per pound....and brought it back immediately!  I told the cashier that it was disgusting!  She looked at it and said....It looks gross!  The other cashier told me that she doesn't foresee this place making it either.  Prices are way too high for the area and quality of food/produce are horrible!  Don't even bother going to the deli!  It's week old salads etc. and chances are you're going to get sick from eating it!  Sure wish Albertson's was still here.  I will now go to Smith's from here on out!  Management & owners are clueless!!!  This place will DEFINITELY NOT MAKE IT!"}
{"text":"Lines are super long with not enough cashiers; even Vons employed more than 2 during peak hours!  I shopped at the Vons every week--it's the same layout but less options.  The premade specialty salads look good but they all taste bad.  I now buy my meals from Fresh and Easy and the Smiths on Charleston, which has amazing options and they manage it correctly.  Very disappointed because this store is so close to my house."}
{"text":"Thankfully, this store is going out of business.  They bought out Albertson's, layed off most of the employees, increased prices, and had a terrible selection.  All of this just to go out of business a few months later.  Shame on them.  Hopefully Smith's will move into this space when they are gone."}
{"text":"My first visit since the Safeway conversion.  I will say I see a lot of positive changes so far.  The produce selection is definately improved from Safeway.  More organic a choices and varieties it great.  Several new fish choices in the meat counter.  Safeway had scaled back everything other than the processed stuff that stays shelf stable so it's nice to have more fresh options.  I am looking forward as the phase in all the offerings they plan to have.  I could care less about the processed foods and those prices since if that's important a I will price shop other groceries but I love having fresh options and am willing to pay a bit more for products that are healthier so as not to have to by the boxed and canned options that have become the cheap And not the most nutritious of options.  Keep up the changes and we'll continue to support it."}
{"text":"The staff is super awesome but the prices are terrible. This place has vons quality but whole foods prices. I  need to spend my pay check on rent not food. Until they lower their prices I can't justify shopping here."}
{"text":"So much more expensive than Von's. Everything is still set up the same, but just with Haggen brands and jacked up prices. I miss Von's so much!!!!"}
{"text":"It's basically like AJ's jacked up prices with a Food City atmosphere. I will just continue to go to Frys signature and Sprouts. This place kinda a joke, thinks it's \"organic\" since it has a few more items than regular stores but not even 5% like Whole Foods. This place gonna be in trouble if they don't adjust pricing."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and much better produce. Meat selection is nicer as well but premium priced. I cannot believe prices on a high percentage of items. I like many will go to Vegas a few times a week before I spend $3.99 \"on sale\" for a $2.16 item."}
{"text":"They fruit isn't that great. Everything is mushy. They say locally produced fruits and veggies, but what grows here locally, cacti? 
Got some turkey meat from the deli, it quickly spoiled. The higher price it is now a burden and doesn't translate into their quality. I miss Albertson's."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I shopped at the Vons at this location for 15 years. I have been to the new store, Haggen, three times and I am sad to say I'm going to have to start shopping elsewhere. The prices are ridiculously high, they are understocked, they don't have many of the items that I shopped for on a regular basis, the bakery section is awful - lacking in choices and dirty, and the steaks had brown spots on them today. 

This is a really sad change for our community."}
{"text":"This market is a disaster! I used to go to this Vons every week to get ingredients here. When Haggen took over, they had different brands at expensive prices. I had to drive a few more miles to the nearest Vons to get some ingredients even though I just live around the block of this Haggen. Ever since I first went into this Haggen store, I never came back. I hope another astonishing market corporation is going to take over this space."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try the store since they took over the Vons store, today was the day. I managed to get two stops at the store in one trip, my first and last. The fact that the parking lot was a ghost town at 3 in the afternoon, should have been a hint.

Their prices are outrageously high, figure on paying 1.5 to 2.5 times as much for any item, compared to Albertsons or Smiths. Comparing items on sale, they are still 1.25 to 2.0 times higher than Albertsons or Smiths on sale price. I'm talking exact same products, in both the above comparisons. This was true for the bakery, deli, produce, meat, etc, basically everything in the store is over priced for the Las Vegas market.

I remember many years ago Raleys came to town, they came from Northern California and were charging Northern California prices in Las Vegas, it didn't work then, it won't work now. By the time Raleys realized they needed to lower their prices, it was too late, they had already lost their customer base. The Las Vegas stores closed. I expect the same thing to happen to Haggen, if they don't address the problem immediately.

They had fresh ground sausage on sale according to the flyer, I searched and could not find it, so I went to the meat counter rang the bell three times to no avail, called the store on my cell phone, line busy, finally found an employee, she got on the PA system, finally the butcher showed up, I asked where the sausage was and he explained that, \"I didn't make any. It was on sale a few weeks ago, it didn't sell very well, so I stopped making it\". I believe in empowering employees, but this type of autonomy, where they can arbitrarily not make an item they are advertising, is not empowering the employee, it's showing a complete lack of respect, consideration and concern for the customer.

It's been mentioned in other reviews, but I noticed the 2 days left on the milk this was a premium brand, their own brand had 11 days left, if I came back in 9 days their brand would probably only have 2 days left.

I went to check out, there was only one line open, since there was less than a dozen customers in the store, it was more than enough. This was at 3:30 in the afternoon.

In general this store is pathetic, as I said I've been planning to come here since the change back in June, but it appears at least this store is already in a death spiral. They came in with high prices and lost the customer base, no one is going to pay twice as much for the same food they can get at Albertsons or Smiths. They are so short staffed they can't keep the product fresh, maybe they can't afford staff due to loss of sales, due to high prices. And the staff they do have are over empowered to make decisions such as disregarding corporate's decision on sales items.

If you like to throw away money paying higher prices on questionably fresh product, this may be the store for you, it's not for me, I won't be back. I'll just sit back and watch the place implode under the incompetence."}
{"text":"Prices are beyond ridiculously high.  A good place for EBT users I suppose from what I hear.  No condiments for the fresh sandwiches.  Several bread brands totally empty.  Liquor and meats not affordable.  Long lines due to layoffs.  Great parking choices.  Something needs to be done to stop the hemmoraging.  Not the employees fault.  I feel bad for them.  Bring back albertsons."}
{"text":"terrible!!! turn this place into a frys and ill come back. dont fix what aint broke!!! WOW !!"}
{"text":"Not impressed - lots of hype but there's no way this place fits the area. More expensive and less selection than albertsons. As others have posted - they put a new coat of paint and some shiny stickers on the vons. Smiths has better bakery. Local fish? From where? Meat counter and bakery looked barren. Maybe we will get lucky and they turn this place into another glaziers soon? Might come back in a few months to see if it's still open because even the parking lot is empty."}
{"text":"The only reason I even give them 2 stars is because I like the employees and I have been shopping this location for 13 years. Haggens has been a big disappointment, they slowly have been carrying less and less. Heard from a good source that they haven't been able to pay to for all of their shipments. They won't be able to stay open if they can't pay for their inventory. I know they aren't overpaying for manpower, they cut their people way back. Just waiting for a major chain to buy them them out, they got in way too deep."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that there were no ingredient lists on some of the prepackaged deli items.  I asked the deli worker if she had something that said what the ingredients were and she couldn't help me.  She just said that they didn't come with any.  I thought it was illegal to sale food items without the ingredients listed.  I didn't buy anything from the deli. I went into to store to buy poppy seed filling but  they didn't have any.  I ended up going to Smith because I knew they would have it. I never went back because I don't see the point of having to go to two stores.  It's a waist of time.  This store needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Floral department is a joke! Nothing out everything is left in the back. The worst selection ever."}
{"text":"I see these reviews that don't give the formally known as Von summerlin Haggens store good feedback. I want to let everyone know, that as a regular customer to the former Von's and now Haggens grocery store, I truly appreciate the stores small town feel with them actually purchasing from local vendors. The prices are comparable to Albertsons, Von's and much cheaper than the natural organic products store, such as Trader Joes or Whole Foods, while still providing organic products. The store still has an amazing selection and a variety of products and in a lot of cases are less than the Albertsons which is closer to my home but I choose to go to the Haggens on my way home from work, despite not being the closes grocery store. I am glad to know the friendly faces that were with Von's, even with the store transition, are still the friendly faces I see at Haggens. They all enjoy their job and have nothing but great things to say about the Haggen brand products and are excited and speak highly about the company. I don't see a change in the cost of my over all bill but even if the cost was more, it sure can't top the clean environment,  the fresh feel, great floral selection, and a staff that goes out of their way to ensure that I am satisfied at the end of my shopping experience."}
{"text":"This store was formerly an Albertsons which was not a good value to start with.  Haggens is ten times worse! This store is filthy , under stocked , and way over priced. There was maybe 10 people in the whole store, customers that is , and less employees. Did anyone in management notice the Smiths on Boulder is packed full of people shopping? I don't think Southern Nevada is going to support this c graded store We won't be back.This store is a ripoff."}
{"text":"High prices, poor selection and uninviting in general."}
{"text":"Barren looking, not adequately  stocked. Very expensive also. Not going back as there are other much better choices. I also wish Glaziers had opened in one of the locations."}
{"text":"What a horrible place.  First of all they laid off all of the former employees. I had asked the people who worked there whether they would be keeping their jobs and they had said yes.  Now I find that they are all gone and were laid off!  many of them were super nice and helpful. How horrible of a business to come in and lay off all of the staff.  The quality of the products is poor.  We purchased meat there, took it home and it was obviously spoiled as it smelled bad.  Prices are not competitive. There is NO ONE shopping in the store.  I can't wait for the place to close and hopefully be replaced with a real grocery store.  Hopefully one who values their staff!!!  Shame on you Haggen!  Never going back unless it is an extreme emergency!"}
{"text":"None of the produce is fresh. I LIGHTLY squeezed a Roma tomato, and it exploded. Wish I had taken a photo, but my hand was covered in stale tomato juice and seeds. All the other tomatoes were also mushy and on the verge of rotting; there was not a single firm one. 

Everything is overpriced. For example, as much as I love rotisserie chicken, I'm not dishing out $8--that's seriously just as pricy (if not more) than the chickens in Hawaii, and this is Henderson/Vegas. I'll drive out to Smith's from now on--the extra couple mile drive is more than worth it. 

Also, a lot of new, miserable faces working here...can't blame em, the atmosphere of the store is so depressing now. Produce workers refuse to make eye contact.

I don't give a damn about the supposedly wider selection of brand names and organic junk--that's what Whole Foods is for. To put it simply, Haggens sucks."}
{"text":"I really love this food chain market.  I have always preferred quality in meats especially.  The meat department has extremely nice butchers. They always help me to make the best selection. People must realize that anything of quality is expensive & is good for you. I understand the sudden change but at least you have choices."}
{"text":"Lame. Lame lame lame.
So glad they are going away. For a \"renovated\" store, it was nasty. Looked older than some of the older stores in Vegas. Quality of products was seriously lacking. No specials, or values on anything I saw. Wont come back."}
{"text":"I found myself in this store because I was looking for a specific product and their website said it could be found there.  They did have it and it's .50 less than Whole Foods but that is not saying much.  Having walked around a little I think the prices are extremely high and the selection on certain items is not very good.  You will never find me pushing a cart in here for that reason.  But if money is no object this is the store for you!  I never frequented it when it was Von's so I have nothing to compare it to as far as layout.  The employees that I've encountered while browsing are friendly as are the cashiers but the store is a ghost town and every time I've been there has not been more than one cashier open but there really doesn't need to be.  I don't imagine this store will survive long.  The 3 stars are for the friendliness of the employees and for having my specialty item."}
{"text":"This place is where budgets go to die. I have been to many grocery stores in the valley and their prices only rival AJ's. Even the downtown Safeway on McDowell has lower prices and they're ridiculous.  At least AJ's is well kept and has other redeeming qualities.

First, it's extremely obvious this is just a rebranded Albertsons. Same fixtures, cracked and unsightly flooring and the feeling you are in some crotchety Ebenezer-run supermarket. Nice on the outside to get you in, ugly store and outrageous prices when you arrive.

I heard about the whole debacle between Haggens / Albertsons / Safeway, this seemed inevitable... the store is closing with everything on sale. This is the only reason I entered, but I probably would have went in otherwise just to laugh at the prices.

Most items are 30% off, soft drinks and chips 10%, meat & booze 20%. Even with the discounts, many items are still higher than Wal-Mart and even Fry's.

I saw a cooler that sounded like a good deal after 30% off, looked it up in Wal-Mart's app, they have the same brand double the size for the same price (after 30% off).

I did get a good deal on a few things that are the same price elsewhere then 30% off helped: deodorant and gum. Stock up sale!

There are some deals to be had, just get here soon. The place still has a good stock as of 11/7/2015. Just be sure you're getting a deal."}
{"text":"No organic eggs, no organic veggies, bad yogurt, bad meat... I would have thought the point of Haggen taking over for Vons was to make better. We already loved the organic options and non-organic options but now we have to find another grocery store after taking 4 years to find the right place. Thanks Haggen!"}
{"text":"The new player in town that never was....I know that Albertson's had to choose between this location and the Safeway across the street,  but I feel so sorry for the strong management team and staff that will be on the losing end of this decision.   I hope that another grocer (Basha's or Fry's maybe?) can take over this location and bring it back to life!"}
{"text":"I just read all the reviews and now feel hopeless.....Haggens marketing is terrible. The grand opening never happened. Just awful. I guess they will continue to shut down stores.  Which reminds me....do they have stock I can short? 

The marketing people deserve an award for their ability to live with 2 brain cells (One for breathing, the other for standing up). They did nothing when they reopened to welcome the community.  Nothin.....think on that.....I'm opening a giant new store and my strategy is do nothing. 

I tried to remain upbeat as their meat and fish are excellent but the store is empty so it's time to give up.
When I complained to one of the big shots  from corp. Haggen visiting  that the store should have a grand opening ....balloons ....and music and a few big sales he said, 'everyone is out of town'.....I assume he hasn't been to frys.....the store is packed with customers, 10 lanes of checkers....all busy day and night.  Frys probably brings in 100,000 a day in revenue
So....clueless....yes.....hired nice new cashiers but all the lanes are closed?...yes......prices? high on fresh produce and, yes....much of it is spoiled. A great recipe for failure. Another reviewer said the store was a little dirty and some of the new hires are unprofessional.....I like the new hires.....store, I must agree, could look better. 
Fire the bozos at the top....then free the worthless marketing people from their chains ....they can back to staring at the walls of their homes where they will feel safe and not have to make stupid non decisions 

They know zip zero about marketing.....all this is a waste ....so sad"}
{"text":"Seriously? I went inside for a few things with an open mind..but when they ask $15 for a small container of Tide laundry soap, I can't take them seriously. Their prices suck. 
They really are a mixture of whole foods(prices) and fresh and easy(convenience).
Save your time and go to Smiths."}
{"text":"This location was changed from Albertson's and I love it! They offer better quality foods and more organic options.

The store isn't quite fully changed over yet so there are better things to come.

I can't wait!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  Haggen destroyed the local supermarket in Summerlin.   When they took over, there was no announcement and most of the employees lost their jobs.   Prices went up, quality down and you go in there now and shelves aren't stocked.   I went in for water to find none stocked (except Haggen).  I will not support this company or any spinoffs of it based on what they've done."}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way home to see what it was like.  Now I have and I won't be back.  This is a very large supermarket that should be a Wegmans.  

I was looking for three items and to check out the new store that used to be Vons.  What I found was a very over-priced selection of groceries.  I got one of the three items I came for.  The deli section is anemic at best.  

As I walked around, I saw 2 litre soda on sale marked down to $1.79 from $1.97.  I can go to a dollar store and get the same thing.  Why on Earth would I take such a sale?

Finally, it took more time to check out than it shoudl given the very few customers in the store and there was only one register open.

I can see the for lease sign on the building now.

Come west #Wegmans, come west!"}
{"text":"I miss Vons! I've shopped at Vons since I was a newlywed.. I used to thoroughly enjoy my Vons club... And the feeling of being at Vons. It is always empty now... And the prices are ridiculous!
$5 for a quart of half and half??!  And some of my favorite go-to products are missing...
Looks like Trader Joes just got all of my business!"}
{"text":"Well, it's been a few months and I'm afraid I have to update my review.  I came in the store the other day and many of the shelves were barren.  I took a photo of the meat department (which I will upload) and there were few meats available.  I asked a Manager if they were shutting down the store and trying to get rid of inventory and he told me they were in Chapter 11 reorganization and would have the shelves stocked by vendors the following day and were promised better support going forward.  

Now, I hope that is true and they make it because they have good products and it's convenient for a quick stop on my way home from work.  I think I may be willing to fight a small bear for their bakery's brownie cookies as well.  In addition, I also think their produce is nice compared to Von's.  

As far as pricing, you just have to look for deals. They have come down it appears and I still say Albertson's has higher pricing.  

Even though this location is not my main shopping spot (nor was Von's previously as something happened where they went downhill a year before Haggens came along), I am rooting for them to get their groove on and succeed"}
{"text":"Bring back Albertsons!  Same employees - good.  Less food selections at higher prices.  Less sales / specials.   The fish counter looks so sad too.  Tried to buy eggs once.  All the eggs were expiring the next day or within the week...WTF?

People are always resistant to change... I get that.  But you made this market worse.  Whereas I used to go to Albertsons all the time, I now travel to Smiths and Sprouts more often."}
{"text":"We moved to this side of town and this is the closest grocery store to us. We started shopping there and I noticed things were a bit pricey. I thought they couldn't be that much more expensive so I went to Smiths this last big grocery trip to compare. I was shocked at how much cheaper Smiths was! Not like cents cheaper but dollars! It's crazy. I will go to Haagen for quick just need a few things but my big grocery shopping will be at Smiths. Haagen does have a huge ice cream selection but the prices are outrageous. The cookies from Haagen are very good. They never seem to have good sales either. The checkers have always been nice except for the one lady who wouldn't let me pay for the firefighter behind me. She was weird. I love that they have the little shopping carts for the kids but the high prices will keep me away."}
{"text":"If this is the best Haggen can do as a local neighborhood food market then their in big trouble.

Came in today to see what all the grand opening hype was about and I was extremely underwhelmed to say the least.

I went around the store twice to find Almond Breeze almond milk and no such luck. I noticed that they don't have an alternative health aisle for those people who eat gluten free and dairy free items.

I also noticed that some of their organic vegetables were moldy. Yikes! 

Some of the prices for speciality brand items like Lara bar granola cereal was way over priced and sports drinks like Zero Vitamin water was priced at $3.50 more than what you would pay for at Target.

I seriously can not recommend coming here and what makes this store even more unappealing is that the cashiers don't seem to happy about working here."}
{"text":"We were really excited about our Vons becoming a Haggen but my son and I went this morning and it was kind of disappointing. They took a lot of stuff out I guess to make it more spacious but it just seems empty, sterile and unappealing now, the little bit of decor that was there looked like 80's mid-west farmer.  We went to the bakery and they have the bagels hanging on hooks?! I tried one of the jalapeno bagels, tasted bland, heavy and it didn't have that yummy crispy cheese edge like Vons used to make them. My son didn't like his donut and threw it away! My kids used to love the Vons donuts. On the up side we probably shouldn't be eating those thing anyway so thanks for that. oh and a side note, didn't care for the country music either. The lady ahead of us in line didn't like it so much she was asking the cashier where the closest Vons was so she could go there."}
{"text":"As a NW transplant, I was disappointed when I saw that the Von's in my neighborhood was now a Haggen. I wouldn't shop there when I lived in up north, and I won't shop there now. The store was completely dead on a weekday late afternoon right before dinner. I walked through the product dept. to check prices...OMG. Exorbitantly high prices on basic fruits and veggies. The meat was even worse. I paid $4 for a gallon of milk and we went out that night....probably cheaper than buying food to prepare a meal based on what I saw."}
{"text":"This was supposed to be an upgrade from Vons, yet  nobody seems happy, employees or customers. There is not much selection and whatever is available is far too over priced! A bit sad and disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Von's at this location for 14 years. Change the name and increase the prices by 35%? Really? Albertson's and Smith's will get more regular business and the people already loyal to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's stay there. I miss Von's and refuse to pay the ridiculous prices offered here. I am voting with my feet and will not be back until Von's buys the location back."}
{"text":"I have been to this store twice to give it a chance but will not be back. The prices are way over the top and there are other places to shop around here. I liked Albertson's but not this overpriced store."}
{"text":"This Haggen is awful and overpriced. I just paid $10 for a watermelon (stupid, I know) to come find out that's it's all rotten inside. I wonder how long it's been sitting on a shelf. Well, at least I'm gonna get my money back later today when I return in. Please bring back Vons. This place royally sucks!

P.S. The only chilled white wine they have is Chardonnay. Seriously people? Some of us prefer to drink Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc!!!

Update: I returned my watermelon and got money back. However, the guy who packs bags at the register, made sure to tell me to check the watermelon for hardness next time to avoid getting a bad one. Really??!!! How about Haggen checks their produce section for rotting products next time? What a joke this place is!"}
{"text":"Haggen reorganized the produce section and in my opinion it flows so much better, there seems to be a greater selection of produce now too.  Not to mention a larger organic section to choose from as well.  The spacing of aisles is much better.  

As far as selection of products, they do have a quite a bit that I'm still trying to get accustomed to.  It's too early to tell if I'm a fan of their brand's stuff or stick with my favorite product brands.  As for selection of meats and seafood, it seems about the same if not a little bit more.  

The one area that seems to be a bit bare at the time I went is the bakery section.  It's definitely a lot more roomy in that section, but seems like it could use an extra self standing self or two in the common space.  As far as selection of breads and stuff, a good amount but one thing missing was some pita bread.  The lady said they will look into it as the old Vons used to have it and it seems odd to have all these different hummus, yogurt dips, etc. with no fresh pita bread.

As far as the staff, it seems to be a lot of the same friendly Vons staff from before.  Checking out is still pretty smooth and plenty of open stands.  The staff mentioned there will be a few more upgrades in the coming months, given what I've seen so far it'll be exciting to see what else they add to bring this regional chain into town!"}
{"text":"Since the new folks have taken over its really gone downhill. The store is dirty, and they don't have enough staff. While buying flowers yesterday there wasn't anyone at the flower check out, but there were two employees nearby complaining about their personal lives."}
{"text":"Large selection of produce..a little pricey. Store was kinda empty. Had to take my daughter to ladies room..was filthy. Not a good impression."}
{"text":"Wrote the first review four months ago. Did not return except once and the grave stocking manager Sonny greeted me warmly and really tried to convince me to return . What is wrong with corporations who come in spend four months here and close. Shame on you Haggens for not putting in the effort! You took the number one grossing store at Von's and turned it into a \"ghost town\" your management with the exception of Sonny who is exceptional stinks. The pricing structure is insane this is an organization who wrote the book on how NOT to succeed in business."}
{"text":"Although some staff transitioned over like the butcher, this place is not what Safeway was. The prices are HIGH. Comparative shopping is just out the window here. Assume everything is much more expensive.  
At least I can shop virtually alone since I'm usually one of 4 people in the whole store, employees included. Where is Trader Joes or WF??

I'll even take Safeway back."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I think this was a downgrade from Von's. They have lost some of the variety of products, namely at the deli counter. Also, there's a definite price increase from Von's. Not seeing any improvements to draw me to shop here other than location."}
{"text":"Update: Reported on September 25, 2015, pending approval by the US Bankruptcy Court, Haggens will be closing all NV stores within the next year.  It was only a matter of time.

Once upon a time we have a great Vons location here in Summerlin where Summerliner's happily shopped.  Apparently Haggen's thought they could buy a bunch of Vons locations, slap green signs everywhere, and charge Whole Food's prices for either the same or inferior products.  Well, it looks like they were wrong.  Anyone who regularly shopped here when it was Vons would know that the location,while not as busy as some grocery stores in town (which was a good thing), would immediately notice that this store is nearly empty all the time. What a shame.  Bring our Vons back!

A simple google search revealed this is not the only location enjoying the same rate of success: http://www.seattletimes.com/business/retail/haggen-cuts-worker-hours-in-seattle-area/"}
{"text":"I love this store great customer service better selection and quality in produce two thumbs up. :)"}
{"text":"I saw the article in the City News about this grocery store.  I was shocked when I found out they replaced the Albertson's on Via Linda.  It only took them 44 hours to change everything over.  I hope they continue to change things around as the store is a little dirty just like Albertson's was.  I bought lots of clearance items on my first visit.  I think they were getting rid of a lot of things left by Albertson's which was great because I made out like a bandit.  They had 64oz organic juices - Apple, Cherry, Blueberry, Cranberry on sale for only $1.24 and boy did I clean them out.  I bought every last one of them.  It definitely was a great price for organic juice and in the 64 oz container.  They also had put out lots of finger foods for people to try and boy was the cinnamon rolls amazing much better than any grocery store cinnamon rolls I have ever tasted.  Most of their prices are somewhat high and are inline with Safeway or Whole Food prices.  But they also have lots of sales and clearance items.  Their customer service needs help desperately.  I needed a wagon because my arms were filled with juices and I asked a clerk where they were he pointed me in the right direction but he really should have gotten one for me rather than chatting and laughing with his buddies.  More training in customer service is def. needed.   They do not have saver cards like all the other stores, they said their prices are already low they do not need cards.  Also I was disappointed they did not have Boar's Head they instead have a brand of cold cuts I never heard of called DiLusso's.  I would rather have Boar's Head as Boar's Head does not have any preservatives and while they said their product did not have preservatives either on the website for DiLusso's they did not claim this.  so be very careful about buying the cold cuts from here, plus they are about $1-4 more expensive than Boar's Head.  Time will tell if this store is able to function, not sure why most of their prices are not inline with the area.  The store was pretty much empty when I was there at 7pm on a Monday night.  I spoke with the manager and was hoping they would get lots of stuff from the local farmers like they do at lots of their other stores, but he said not right now  maybe sometime later so this means nothing is real fresh as most of then stuff comes from there warehouse in California.  Go see for yourself - some may like and some may not - for me it is kind of a cross between - Whole Foods, Safeway, Sprouts, and A.J.'s.  Happy Shopping :)"}
{"text":"I went in to Haggen and it was so much cleaner looking.  The aisles are really open so it was easier to maneuver.  The meat is amazing!!!!!!  I was really excited to see that there was a choice between the regular quality and some premium quality.  Never had that before.  I just think that it takes time to adjust to a new store and layout.  
The store also seems brighter and more open.  I think some people are giving it a bad rap.  All the help is the same so nothing has changed there.  They are all really nice."}
{"text":"My husband insisted on going opening day around 10 p.m., (they opened at 4) and there was none of the opening day fanfare you would expect. It was tough to even locate an employee. Can I be both underwhelmed and nonplussed? Yes, thanks Haggen. 

There was a lot of empty space in this store. I liked it much better when it was Von's. Food is MORE expensive than Von's and Albertson's which are outrageous! Two bags of groceries were $90.00! I protested then decided to let my deranged husband make the purchase so I could rub it in when he was starving after exceeding the grocery budget. I felt violated by the outrageous prices. I had a colonoscopy that hurt less. 

We shant darken the door in that establishment ever again. Kiss my cash goodbye suckas! I'm going back to Trader Joe's, Sprouts, and if I'm desperate for something in the wee hours, Fresh and Easy."}
{"text":"This store is very disappointing, the produce is not up to standards and their pricing is higher than you would expect. Also, the deli seems to have less and less items...the only good thing left here is the Starbucks and the great employee that work there."}
{"text":"High prices and arrogant customer service.  Loved this location when it was an Albertson's store, but my first visit after it transitioned to Haggen will be my last.  Prices were significantly higher with no noticeable difference in quality.  I dropped a note to their customer service department via email regarding my observations and instead of offering to share the feedback with the store manager and regional manager (as I had asked), I received an arrogant response stating that their prices were \"within a few cents\" with their competitors (absolutely not the case based on what I saw) and that they carry a lot of premium products not found at other stores (also a gross exaggeration).  Basically their business model seems to be to create an illusion that they are a premium store so that they can charge more.  Scattering organic products throughout the store does not make it a premium store.  Deli and bakery were nothing special.  I don't think that Haggen is going to make it in the ultra-competitive Phoenix market."}
{"text":"I wrote a review second day they were open complaining about their extremely high prices. I guess it was taken down. We'll see about this one. I don't know why corporate didn't adjust their prices when they saw the enormous  sales slump. Now they're in bankruptcy. Good for them. Feel sorry about the local staff. I still go to Henderson to do 95% of my shopping. Even Albertsons prices are above normal. Maybe they'll put a Smiths or trader Joe's in its place."}
{"text":"This location used to be Vons (Safeway), which I didn't mind in the least.  When I ventured here last week for the first time since the switch over, everywhere seemed the same as Vons, which I chalked up to the recent transition.  It seemed as they just slapped green shirts on the employees and called it good.  I review again if they ever morph into something different or more special that Vons."}
{"text":"As a former resident of western Washington,  I feel it's necessary to make it clear that this \"Haggen\" is no Haggen. This location (and I'm assuming the others in the valley) lacks the pieces that make Haggen awesome--the delightfully complicated floor plan, the wide selection of specialty and organic food, wonderful and fresh produce, and a made-to-order deli with sandwiches, sushi, and salad/cheese/olive bar that was a regular lunch staple for me! (If any east coasters are familiar with Wegmans, Haggen is like a west coast Wegmans.) Sure, when money was a little tight I would go to Haggen just for meat, produce and a meal from the deli and pick up the other pantry staples somewhere cheaper, but the prices I paid for those items were well worth the extra cost. Here, though, the produce was overpriced and low quality, the deli was absolutely nothing like how it should be, and we found expired milk and bread. :(

My husband and I were so excited when we got the mailers, thinking we could return to our favorite grocery store from WA. However, this location is basically (probably literally) an old Vons that they put no effort into making a real Haggen; they just slapped some Haggen signs throughout. I was disappointed and will continue shopping at Sprouts on W. Sahara."}
{"text":"HORRIBLY overpriced!!!!!!!!!! There is absolutely nothing special about this store and very little change since Albertsons. 
I only stop here for convenience when I have to as I am a smith's shopper usually. I tallied the overage on prices for the 6 items I bought there versus the usual prices at smith's and I paid about $6 more at haggens than I would have at smith's for same items - $21 vs $15!!!!!!!!!!
I could see paying more if the store were perhaps more upscale or better selection but So Not The Case! I have absolutely no idea how they are staying in business. I wanted to like this store as a worth it convenience splurge stop but it's nowhere close to that."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN....is what my girlfriend and I decided after I got a salad there from the grab n' go section that was literally rotten. My girlfriend has been a long time shopper of VONS and was not excited when she found out that Haggen replaced VONS. We gave it a chance and have been shopping there for about a month with hope that things will get better....
Poor customer service, prices are average to high when compared to VONS and food quality poor (my rotten salad). My recommendation , either buy processed/frozen items to avoid rotten or moldy food....or take a short drive to Smiths on Charleston. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst rebrand in recent memory, with increased prices and worsened efficiency in every department from frozen food to pharmacy.  Not sure if the increased organic section is somehow meant to compete with Whole Foods, but it seems unlikely a place still pushing fast-food Chinese is going to lure the granola crowd across the street while the other changes are likely to send others over to Smith's or Albertsons for better prices and less hassle."}
{"text":"well, this is a first for me, an update of an update. Just learned today that Haggen will be closing all their Vegas stores by end of November, so this store is history.  This company apparently way overexpanded and is now in bankruptcy.  This stupid store was only at the Vons location for about a year!  And now they're gone. So the question now is: what will take its place at this location?  Stay tuned!  As soon as I know, I'll update again! I hope it's a store that'll stay put for more than....uh... a year?"}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just so I could post this review.  If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  In my opinion, Haggen is a big miss.  Unless I have to go there in a pinch for a pharmaceutical item, I won't be back.  Today I spent for lunch $1.59 for one baked chicken leg, $1.99 for one baked chicken breast and $3.40 for cucumber and onion salad -- seriously???  On a previous visit, an employee was sitting in the aisle going through expired snacks, opening the bags and sharing them with a co-worker.  Surreal.  Whole Foods here I come for lunch -- permanently..."}
{"text":"It is a shame what they did to our local Albertsons. The deli counter has changed and not for the good. And the price increases on just about everything is what is driving me away. I wil now travel the distance to shop elsewhere."}
{"text":"Albertsons needs to come back. Cannot believe they switched the entire store within a few days"}
{"text":"This was an Albertson's before Haggen came to town. Didn't care for it much then, but learned to love as a Haggen. Pretty sad now that they are going out of business. Sad because the employees that once had job security with Albertson's lost that when Haggen took over. Sort of reminds me of when Albertson's sold locations to Raley's years ago. Same thing happened.

Outside of that, this had become one of my regular stops after work. I liked what they had done to the place after taking over. It was much cleaner and welcoming afterwards. Now I guess I will just have to wait and see what comes in its place. For now, this place is quickly looking like a rundown factory store. Cold, empty and a ghost town feel. Sad."}
{"text":"Watch out for rising prices! You might hurt yourself trying to buy hamburger/hot buns & English Muffins at $4.79 but were under $3 previously. Pop that was $4.99 now almost $7.00. They close November 24th. Presumably taking their inventory with them."}
{"text":"So unhappy that this was changed to Haggen...you need to hand it back to Vons!!!!!
I went in and needed Crystal Geyser 1 gallon bottled water. There was only one on the shelf.
When I went to check out, I asked the cashier if they had any more....she just gave me a look did not even attempt to ask someone in the back to check and said no.
Very poor, poor customer service and I am going to tell everyone I know not to shop at Haggen.
You just lost a good customer as I average $500.00 per month on groceries! Horrible"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened here? How can you open a store like this and then have it fail so quickly? I guess someone at corporate didn't do their demographic research? This store had such great potential. Darn, now I'm stuck either going to WalMart (wall of people), or Smith's (which has become a major zoo). What to do when you are in search of Non GMO foods?"}
{"text":"I want to like it, some items are for the better but overall the pricing is higher.  The produce looks much better.  The deli counter is now to expensive for us.  The fresh bacon options are not as enjoyable.  I shopped there again this morning but I will be comparing with another store next time."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I didn't think it would be possible to downgrade from Albertsons, but Haggen has managed just that.

They billed themselves as a hip store with a farmer's market type feel. There is absolutely nothing (except higher prices) about this place that is special AT ALL. 

This store is walking distance from my house and I have only been in TWICE since they opened. I feel bad for the staff, they all seem so unhappy, but have been nice each time I was in there.

I hear they will be closing soon, which is obvi since they've stopped restocking some items."}
{"text":"I hate to pile on here but this place is in serious trouble. Prices run high, large empty spaces throughout. The only good thing is that business is so poor you can get big discounts on meat that's about to expire. Homemade cookies are to die for. I hope they can turn this around."}
{"text":"shame on this company.  promised the inherited employees 2 years of employment and training, they got less than 4 months and the whole place went out of business.  prices were ridiculously out of line with the other local markets, from the 2nd week on shelves weren't stocked and never a special in the store.  when the last 10 days were upon the store and everything was 60% off, it was finally in line w/ the other markets!

it had to have been planned to deliberately fail."}
{"text":"I miss Vons. Since the changeover everything is overpriced about $1-$2. Some of the meat and fish in the displays at the counter seem a little old. I am glad to see some of the old employees still working here though, but I will drive the extra 2 minutes to the Smith's on Charleston from now on."}
{"text":"Today was my first time shopping here and I am very disappointed with the way the employees act they are very unprofessional loud, joking, carrying on personal conversion with each other their conversations were childish the employees seem to be a bunch of over grown children with no self discipline or acceptable customer service skills"}
{"text":"Very bad....Everything overpriced.....No butcher,no bakery staff...Looks like more jobs lost....Got home and my overpriced bananas now look rotten on bottom...we did try there pork chops which had a good flavor..."}
{"text":"I didn't notice a huge change from its former life as Albertson's. Prices seemed higher on a lot of items, and 2 clearance items rang up wrong (just like at Albertson's)!
The ad didn't have much I was interested in so that was disappointing. Overall, the stock was quite similar to what Albertson's had and the store didn't seem to be remodeled much at all. 
The frozen dinner prices were pretty high and I didn't see many of those on sale, which they usually are in most grocery stores. 
Von's is the closest competing grocery store in the area and I prefer that store to this one, but I will return here to give it another try. This is not my regular grocery store but if I'm in the area I usually stop here for a few things."}
{"text":"I am sure they came to town with the highest expectations but I don't think they will last here.  The store is very nice but I feel, and so do many of my neighbors, that they have priced themselves out of our marketplace.  Being in the middle of a retirement community has it's drawbacks.  Some of us are living on our retirement income and are not willing or able to pay for upscale (think Whole Foods) prices.  I see that they are striving for higher quality but until the prices are lowered on a regular basis, I cannot afford to shop there.  The store appears to be mostly empty when I have stopped in because of convenience for one or two items."}
{"text":"I've been in Haggen's twice, and so far they're only middle of the road. My first visit I would have rated them 4 because the produce department has an impressive selection of good produce. My second visit they rate a 2. Their fresh-baked bread was very hard on top and their deli is lacking in cheese. There was a variety of deli meats, no problem there. But where's the cheese? There were only signs for four types of cheese and zero blocks on display. But it's a large grocery store deli, they gotta have cheese, right? I ask for a half pound of provolone and the employee reaches into the case where there's a small saran - wrapped package of cheese. He tells me this is all the provolone he has and weighs it. It's .45lb so I say close enough, but I ask him where's all the cheese? He's apologetic but all he can say is this is all they have. If the cheese truck broke down or the cheese cooler died, he'd have said something, right? Okay so, the only other cheese I can see is one small package of maybe swiss. So, every other deli customer for the rest of the day (or until whenever they find a couple of blocks of cheese) was s.o.l., other than that one lucky guy who only wants a small packet of swiss. Go to the prepackaged dairy section? Go to another store is more likely. I have to agree with another reviewer who said something along the lines of, this store says they've been in business for 80 years, they should be a little more together than this. PS Haggen's - Don't let the 3 stars swell your head, I would've given you a 2.5 if I had the option. But don't worry, I'll be back. I have to see how this ration on cheese plays out."}
