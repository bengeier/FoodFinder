{"text":"The Leo has to be one of the best salads in Charlotte; with its chopped lettuce and mint and parsley, cucumber and tomatoes it cannot get into my mouth fast enough!  The pita that comes with it is perfect for sponging up the remaining lemon vinegarette that is too tasty to waste.

I like the falafel here, too.  Crispy on the outside and not mealy on the inside.  My hubs likes the meat specials and gyro.

and the baklava?  like taking a bite out of an angel."}
{"text":"I was not overwhelmed. Nice space, friendly staff and average food. I had the chicken kabob. It was tasty but the pieces were relatively small and thin so not very juicy. The hummus was very good. Bread? Average."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. DECEIVING PRICES and less than mediocre food! The menu board in the store and online CLEARLY states that the platters are \"Served with pita bread and one of our amazing sauces\" along with 2 sides, however after we ordered and sat down we realized we had been charged .25 cent for each of our sauces (the sauces that were supposed to be \"included\"). When I asked the lady running the register why she had charged me the extra .25 for sauces, she told me it was MY fault for choosing a sauce (after she asked me which of the 3 sauces I would like). She told me \"I could have said no to a sauce...\"(BUT WHY WOULD I IF IT'S INCLUDED IN THE PLATTER?) I told her it was very deceiving to her customers to include an item in a \"platter price\" and then charge extra for it. She then blamed the old owners for designing the menu board the wrong way. I told her she should then at least cover the \"and one of our amazing sauces\" part with tape OR inform the customers that they no longer offer the sauce in the platter price and those customers who want a sauce should be informed that there's an additional charge for it. Our meal for 2 came to $22.07 and over .50 cents worth of deception, a blame game, and gross food, we will never go back."}
{"text":"Not such a great experience. The wait staff appears uncaring and acts as if you are inconveniencing him to even come into the restaurant. Food is good but will not return due to the waiter disrespect."}
{"text":"Worst food !..was served food which felt like it was  atleast 4 days old . The rice was cold and lumpy and meat was uncooked and rubbery . Would not recommend it . This place is expensive  and waste of your time and money ."}
{"text":"very slow service in spite of restaurant not being busy! food quality overall is substandard--especially at this price. won't visit again."}
{"text":"Kabob grill is our favorite for a healthy lunch. The chicken soltani lunch melts in your mouth.  Both times I've catered Kabob Grill (for groups of ~30), businessmen and businesswomen have come back to the conference room with Tupperware and ziplocs  after the meeting...  This never happens, so you get the idea-- use Kabob Grill for catering to leave a great impression."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Ordered delivery and Kabob was overcooked, appetizers were bland, pita was cheap, store bought kind."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get! Food is bland! And did I mention expensive! There are other kabob spots that gives you what your money's worth."}
{"text":"Best kabob place in the area! Service is quick & it's always hot & fresh. We always start with the hummus. I order the chicken skewer and hubby orders the combo skewers. The bell peppers and onions are delicious too."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place! The ambience has a lot to be desired since it's empty so much of the time though. The location is pretty bad and you have to know what your looking for or you'll miss it. It's pretty sad because the food is just out of this world and the service is quick. 

I hope the word eventually gets out about this place otherwise it might shut its doors soon. Get it while you can!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend. I've been sick to my stomach since eating there this evening. Ordered chicken shawarma and hummus. Hummus was excellent; however, the chicken was way over cooked and lacked appropriate seasoning. Pita bread was stale and dry.  I thought the chicken tasted a little funny, but attributed it to the poor seasoning at the time. I left over half on my plate and declined a doggy bag. In retrospect, I think the chicken was on the verge of spoiling and then over cooked to masked it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!  I discovered this joint a few weeks ago and have already been back multiple times!  The staff members are very friendly and always  greet their customers!  I always order the steak kabob platter.  It's two steak kabobs, rice, salad, pita bread and a side of your choice. The meat is always so flavorful and tender.  Seriously I have no complaints because the food tastes amazing every time I eat here.  The restaurant itself is always very clean inside! You can tell the staff really takes pride in the restaurant.  My favorite mediterranean food spot in Vegas, that I've found so far :)  delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm used to this awesome place in Chicago but this place is pretty good. I had the chicken kabob platter with pita and hummus. I got two skewers of chicken kabobs on top of a large portion of rice. The rice looked plain but when you add the lemon that they include to it, it is fire! The hummus was ok and the two pita rounds that they give you are plenty. 90% of the skewers were chicken. I like veggies so I was a little disappointed with the amount of them on the kabobs. I do wish the chicken and the hummus had more flavor but the rice made up for that. The service was great and they were fairly quick with my order. They even bring it out and hand it to you while you're seated. I'd like to try the Gyro next time and see where that stands but I'll try it again for sure! :)"}
{"text":"I've finally found Middle Eastern deliciousness in the QC!  This is such a quaint little place, with out-of-control good food.  The hummus was fantastic.  I would also recommend the fattoush and any of the kabobs.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place has proper falafels. They are moist and delicious and If you get them in the wrap they are accompanied by yummy, pickles, beats, and other veggies. Don't forget the standard tehini sauce. It really is nice to get a proper falafel wrap.

I tend to stick with falafel when I come here. Sure they have grape leaf wraps and some other ok vegan options but their falafel is way better than the other options. They have home made fries that tend to be a little hard and soggy. I don't think they pre-boil the spud strips before frying. Home made fries are always nice though, well usually.

The seating is a little sparse. There are not a lot of places to sit, inside or out. The out side seating is on a side walk but not a busy one and it is covered too, so that is nice. The inside is a little cramped. This is not a place for big groups. I would like to add though, they do have decent aesthetics inside so there are things to help your eyes wander around while you eat.

They service is usually very friendly though a little slow at times. It's not the kind of place you can swing by for a quick snack. However if you want a great falafel this is your place."}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  My son and I both ad pita sandwiches....mine,the lamb, which was tasty, but not much lamb, mostly lettuce.  My son had the beef, which had a little more meat in it, but not much.

Our bigger complaint was one of our servers who was rude!  We were served some type of bread, encased in  Saran, which I thought was a little odd since we had ordered sandwiches, but as I reached for it and actually had my HAND on it, the first server runs by, grabs it out of my hand with the comment that we were NOT to have been served that!   Really?  Ok, so another server made an error, but once it's on the table, be gracious enough to just let it go.  It's only bread, anyway.

Then, we are served our pita sandwiches, wrapped nicely in paper, and as I'm unwrapping it, Rude Server, once again, GRABS it out of my hand, to \"enlighten\" me on how this is to be eaten, partially unwrapping it and handing it back to me.  Does the same routine with my son.

Frankly, I'm a little put off by a server who grabs food out of my hand, TWICE, (or anyone else, when I'm hungry!), so between Rude Server, and not so much meat, I would think twice about revisiting if it weren't so close to home."}
{"text":"I really liked this little hole in the wall restaurant. I picked up some takeout from this place, and Mike and I were really happy with our food.  The guys that I encountered when I picked up my food were really nice - they even offered me a sample of one of their desserts when I was struggling to decide between two choices.

Mike got chicken kabobs, and the chicken was cooked just perfectly. I kept snatching pieces off his plate when he wasn't looking. His two selected sides were also good -- the hummus has tahini in it, which I prefer, and the basmati rice was tasty too.

I had a lamb wrap, which was good too.  I was expecting shaved lamb, but this came with lamb nuggets which were interesting. There was a considerable amount of hummus in the wrap -- I might tone that down a bit, as it was oozing out considerably. But still very tasty.

Get the pistachio baklava -- they're bite-size and yummy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here.  It's one of the few places near me in south Charlotte that I go to regularly.  Note that the food is great here, but its definitely a casual kind of place.  It's not a 5 start atmosphere and service, but both are more than satisfactory.

Back to the food- the kabobs here are ridiculous.  I particularly enjoy the lamb and the kafta kabobs. The chicken is also fantastic.  For appetizers, get the hummous.  Yes- you've had hummous before, but this is on another level.  Another interesting choice is the grilled Halloumi- its salty and has a really interesting texture. Give it a try.

The pita wraps are also great- and a good choice for a meal to go. You can't get them on Friday and Saturdays after 5, so stop by on a weekend or for an early meal and enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem if you are interested in Mediterranean food (particularly Lebanese). The service and food have always been excellent."}
{"text":"The food was very flavorful, but I thought the portions were small for the price. They also cook all their steaks medium rare so if you like your steak well done, you will have to let them know before hand. 

Staff is very nice and willing to get my meal the way I wanted."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and everything was hot, but the flavors were just not there. The chicken was dry and really just wasn't a desirable flavor. Definitely not coming back here. Service was actually horrible. Waited atleast 15 minutes for the check while they walked around."}
{"text":"Very good kabob and rice. Good sides. Excellent  service. Good location.  

Prices are good and the serve time is pretty cook considering what they are making.  Good quality meats. Not the cheap stuff. 

Would def come back"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken kabobs, they were extremely spicy and very tough to eat, also very dry. The potato harra was also very spicy. Also very expensive for not the best. Zoes kitchen is half the price and twice the taste."}
{"text":"Organized staff, Warm service, and delicious food. New to Mediterranean food, however, the chicken kabob platter was worth the price. Very clean and quiet place with some low music in the background."}
{"text":"Best place for Mediterranean food, can't  tell you how many times I've gone to this place and the food gets better and better. Great service, great food, great atmosphere, and by all means great hummus! My god I wish I could eat that all day. All in all fantastic place to eat. Tad bit on the expensive side but what the heck, gotta pay for quality right?"}
{"text":"I bought something to eat from a nearby establishment (for later) then went to Kabob Grill to buy the Vegetarian Combo for lunch (right then). I did not see anyone inside to take an order, so I decided to switch my meals (I am five months pregnant and hungry). I went outside to the tables to eat what I had purchased previously until someone returned. I was talking on the phone and eating while, an employee (I believe he was the manager) came to me and said that the tables were for customers only. Before I could let him know that I was there to get takeout, he very rudely repeated himself again. I simply left. A few minutes later I came back to let him know that I really wanted to buy the Vegetarian Combo but he completely cut me off and dismissed what I had to say. The customer service he gave was absolutely horrendous and I refuse to go back to that establishment."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall has exceptional food. Perfect for a date. I bet I've eaten here a half-dozen times and the quality has always been consistent. Not ideal for bigger parties, as there are only a few tables that seat more than four. In fact, most of the tables are for two, but you can get away with squeezing a third person in there if you like to cozy up with your dinner guests. Outside of the food, I like it because it's quiet. In fact, I've never seen more than a few tables occupied with any visit. It almost makes me wonder how they stay in business (possibly take-out). I hope they do, 'cause I'd sure miss their food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for atleast 4 years. The food is great, the location is great, the service is also great. I highly highly recommend this place to everyone. Nice small place in busy ballantyne."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good, mediterranean neighborhood grill, and this place fit the bill.  Although a little overpriced if you're getting non-wrap entrees, the food was delicious and well worth it.  The hummus was really tasty and fresh - a very large serving that could feed (as an appetizer) a packed table of people.  I had the falafel wrap and thought it was near-perfect.  Not dry (like most falafel), and just a wonderful blend of flavors.  My boyfriend had the chicken wrap and didn't love the marinade, but otherwise agreed that it's a great spot."}
{"text":"Incredible food just tucked into a plaza. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendliness of all staff."}
{"text":"New owners, not the same quality food, also now closed on Sunday. I don't think the spices are the same, garlic sauce taste like mayo. What a shame I went here at least 2 times a week and I live 12 miles away. Have taken friends recently a friend who went here before wanted to go back, he did and was disappointed with the change. My last trip also."}
{"text":"Today marks my 5th time being here so I feel like it's only appropriate I write a review.
Delicious healthy food. You can tell it's fresh ingredients and meats/chicken (very juicy) It's not made until you order. It gets you full and satisfied without feeling horrible about yourself like other fast food joints lol! It's very hard for me to give a restaurant five stars since I'm picky but this deserves it!
Thank you kabob staff for the great food:)"}
{"text":"I went to Kabob for the 1st time and It was a pretty good experience. Im not a expert but I know good food when I eat it. I will admit the menu prices where higher then what I thought they needed to be but it was not astronomically high. 
      I went with a friend and we shared the appetizer of Potato Harra which is Cubes of fried potato, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, red pepper and cilantro. Our plate it had a strong pickled/vinegar taste to it but we still enjoyed it. I got the special of the day which was Kafta blend of ground beef, spices, parsley and onion, tomato, pickles, and onions -it was seasoned well and the rice was very delightful
      I did find the service very helpful. I can see myself going again in the near future to try out something different . Restaurant has a very good location in the Dilworth area"}
{"text":"Nice little place for a casual middle-eastern meal. The wraps are good!"}
{"text":"Favorite shawarma in town
Hard to decide between the chicken and beef
Prefer the plate"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE!! READ before you go !!
We - (my husband and I) came to eat here on Sunday evening at 8:15, there was no one in the restaurant except a couple of servers and the owner was hanging out outside. We asked them if they were open , the servers were unsure and so we started walking outside but the owner sent us back inside saying \"we're open.\" We ordered a drink which they weren't sure how to make because we could hear them bickering amongst each other. We ordered our food and then we heard more bickering so we asked if there was a problem and the server told us that they didn't have fries, which is when the boss walked and in and said what's the problem we can get you fries from
Wendy's. We asked them if we could cancel the order altogether since it felt very awkward at that point. We wanted to pay for the drink which we had barely touched, to our surprise the boss yelled at us and said just go , we don't want you here. He was extremely rude and practically threw us out , he seemed drunk and extremely unprofessional . I couldn't believe how he treated us just for wanting to cancel our order since they didn't have what we wanted in whole. My advise, Do not ever visit this place !!! There are much better places for kabob in the area !!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. My hubby loves the chicken kabob here. Must visit place. But the serving dish quantity changes everytime we visit there. Its not consistency."}
{"text":"I can never go back and I am bummed about it! MAJOR-LY.

Here's the sad, sad tale: 

My husband and I had been frequenting Kabob Grille. Their lentil soup is homemade perfection, their vegetarian combo a delight, and their pistachio baklava is just amazing.

So about a week ago, we were having dinner and a fight broke out between a Middle Eastern husband and wife. More accurately, a husband lost his temper and started yelling at his wife in front of their two young girls. When I say yelling, I mean unbelievably aggressive IN YOUR FACE, I'm-going-to-beat-you-up yelling. This continued for a few minutes inside the restaurant. Then, they took it outside. More yelling - hitting cars - more yelling - pushing. Meanwhile, the two little girls are sitting at the bar, teary-eyed. More yelling. 

What does the manager/owner do about this? NOTHING. He seemed to know the couple. He just stands outside watching as this man reviles his wife. Now, I don't know what caused the fight in the first place but there is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Can you imagine what happens behind closed doors?

What should have been done:

1) The owner/manager tells the couple that this is unacceptable in his establishment
2) Ensure the two girls are OK
3) Call the police when the husband starts hitting parked cars
4) Apologize to customers and staff
5) Offer a complimentary drink or dessert -  at least

None of the above happened."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of great places to eat in charlotte and I was hoping Kabob grill would be different. For the most part the food was good, not fabulous or 4 star worthy, but pleasant enough. 

The chicken kabob was nicely cooked, but they went a little overboard on the seasoning. The basmati rice was good (I'm a big fan of rice) and the potato harra was okay, but way too spicy. The grape leaves, however, were disgusting--way too bitter, they tasted similar to grape leaves I bought at whole foods a long time ago (big mistake). 

I guess in charlotte this would be considered 4 or 5 stars, but for someone who has tasted the real deal, Kabob grill doesn't quite live up to it's high star rating."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to our home so it's a great option when we are undecided!  We usually order take out, we've eaten in once.  It's very clean and the staff have always been very nice.  We always get the same thing...the chicken kabob platter, with double rice and hummus (you get 3 sides) and we order a side of pita to share.  The hummus is exceptional.  The kabobs are always made right then, super fresh and tender, wonderful spices.  The saffron rice is perfect.  I feel like it's a little spendy for take out, the platters are around $12 each but we keep coming back.  You can sign up for text specials too."}
{"text":"Oh I'm so very glad we decided to go here instead of the neighboring Jersey Mikes. Not that there's anything wrong with Jersey Mikes. This was a true gem in the heart of the Stonecrest shopping center, and a must-try for people who enjoy Mediterranean food. 
When we walked in, we were greeted with a dark wood and stone interior, soft lighting, and a kindly waitress who told us \"Sit where you'd like!\", grabbing two menus and taking our drink order. After a brief examination of the menu - basic options, falafel, kabobs (duh), hummus, and some vegetarian options - I decided to stick to a beef kabob with rice and hummus. Now, I'm very picky about hummus, but I ate my entire portion before I was done with the beef. It was perfectly smooth, not grainy, with a hint of lemon and garlic, and not overflowing with olive oil. The beef was good, nothing special, same with the rice. I found myself wishing I had more hummus by the end of the meal. 
I decided to try the Lebanese Knafeh (a cheese pastry soaked in syrup), for a late afternoon treat, and couldn't finish four bites it was so rich. Not for those with sensitive stomachs, but very, very tasty. If you're in the area and aren't afraid to try something new, give this place a shot!

Edit - went back a few more times since then, and it's still great. The beef is tender and the hummus still makes me float cartoon - style off of the floor with glee."}
{"text":"I love Kabob Grill and could eat their food at least once a week. Yes, you may be paying a few extra dollars, but it is worth it! I rather pay a little extra for the best tabouli hummus, falafel, and baba ghanoush in town. I have eaten at other Mediterranean places in Charlotte and their food is not nearly as fresh or tasty. Yes, I have to admit the service can be spotty, and that is why I am only giving it four stars and not five, but this food is worth it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro wrap.  It was way too pricey.  I was disappointed in the pita bread.  It was too heavy and doughy.  The meat was salty and I don't understand why the wrap came with a side.  Can't they price the sandwich alone? Not everyone wants to stuff themselves.  With fries and a drink lunch was over $11."}
{"text":"Wonderful mediterranean dishes...excellent lamb, great flavor in falafels, creamy hummus and to-die-for pistachio baklava."}
{"text":"This place honestly has really authentic kabobs and the service is absolutely exemplary. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food, always accepts our coupons even if they are out of date.  The food is always hot, fresh and fantastic!  If you have never tried the potatoes they are a must!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, service is quick, atmosphere is like chipoltle or baha grill, very clean, set up for speed not ambiance.  Prices are a bit high but everything is fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Great place, best Chicken Shawarma with Hummus I've had so far! I try to go there once a week for lunch. Service is always great and quality of food consistently high."}
{"text":"After getting food poisoning from their veggie combo last night, I returned to inform them and to let them know they needed to check the food they served me. Not only did I not get an apology, but the manager or owner questioned whether it was their food, and where was my doctor's bill? He also asked if I even knew what food poisoning was. Not only did I waste my time going back, hoping they could save another customer, I didn't even get an apology!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with this place and found the owner to be very patient and inviting.the food is delicious came when appropriately necessary. I'm from New York and found that this place really competes on a even level with many fine Mediterranean cuisine establishments in NYC. I will absolutely be returning to this gem"}
{"text":"The only negative about this place is the wait staff, they seem to be new and not well trained, the food makes up for this. The food is great, it's fresh and there are so many flavors. The chicken kabob with garlic spread (you have to request the garlic spread it is not on the menu) this combination is delicious. There humus is good. The cheese platter starter is really good also, it's a salty cheese meant to be eaten with the pitas. The lamb and beef are also great, the meats are tender and not dry. Try the Lebanese coffee to finish your meal it is wonderful, it has cardamom in it and have them add a little sugar as it is very strong (the cups are tiny) with baklava for desert."}
{"text":"Love this place. Rice is amazingly good. Gyro meat is super delicious. Pita bread tastes like it was just baked.

I've tried other Mediterranean places and none seem to match this mom-pop joint. Paymons is a close 2nd favorite. 

Sure, the place is small, but other restaurants would tout it as \"intimidate\", but being I'm not a hipster (I realize the irony in that I'm leaving a yelp review) -- I appreciate the smaller venue. 

Sad thing is, if this place ever closes, I'll never know where I'm going to find gyro meat that comes close."}
{"text":"Learn how to smile. Learn how to make hot tea. Learn what is kofte. Meat kabob isn't kofte. Really disappointment. Never again. If you don't know how to do this don't call yourself Mediterranean or middle eastern."}
{"text":"Always fresh with unique favors on all their dishes. I always like to get a combination of kabobs, steak, shrimp or chicken. The falafel is also very tasty.  Their sides are also very well made. Grape leaves are my favorite. 
At first glance it looks a little expensive, but when you get the plate and all the included sides, really tremendous value."}
{"text":"Having spent two years in Columbia, a city devoid of excellent falafel, it warmed the cockles of my heart to find rich, green, moist falafel at Kabob Grill.  I had a vegetarian sampler which was good but not terribly memorable, save for the falafel.  My husband, however, had a lentil and caramelized onion dish that was really great.

We were there on a Friday night (at the Dilworth location), and the belly dancer was incredibly distracting, particularly since we were hungry.  We had difficulty concentrating on anything else.  It's a small restaurant, which resulted in the whole experience of having bangled ass shaken in our faces.  To her credit, the young lady who danced was lovely and talented, but I just wanted to eat."}
{"text":"When your looking for some great Mediterranean food this is the place to try. It was 8pm and I had a craving for tzatziki and they were to the rescue. So when I got there I ended up ordering the kabob chicken plater with salad and hummus. This was really good and I got some Tzatziki for my salad. 

To top it off the service was excellent. This makes it a 5 star for me. They were very attentive to our requests and properly responded to our questions. I will be adding this to our regular stops. 

PS. The hummus was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Delicious and Authentic Mediterranean Food. Probably the best I've had in Charlotte, everything is so fresh and delicious! The hummus and the stuffed grape leaves are my favorites, but we love everything here- it is all good! It is also very beautiful inside , they gave a nice patio and a good wine/beer selection!"}
{"text":"Very bad service.  No one said welcome, they came over and took our order and I asked what they recommended and it was like we were bothering them.  It was not busy in there at all but we got the distict impression that they really didn't care to have us there.  We got our food and the chicken skewer had 3 pieces of chicken on it  and very small...very disappointing.  The flavor was way over powering of lemon and sumac.  We had to ask for our check and they never came to see how our dinner was.  First tine ever i did not  leave a tip.  when we were leaving they never said bye or thank you.  WE willl nver go back!"}
{"text":"I want to like Kabob Grill, I really do! But for me its ok and I probably wouldn't go running back there any time soon.
I grew up eating a lot of Middle-eastern, Mediterranean food and good food so I was excited to try this spot out since a lot of my friends talked about it constantly. Their ambience was ok, staff was incredible but the space was very limited.
The tabbouleh, fattoush, falafel was good and I ordered the lamb kabob which was pretty good too. Their portions are small and prices are a little steep and honestly I have had way better middle-eastern food around this area, so this is a no for me."}
{"text":"Worst service! They messed up with the order. At first the waiter came up with Wrap instead of Shawarma then corrected but then came up with lamb shawarma instead of Chicken. Every time it took 15 mins to come up with a dish (just to discover it was wrong!!). There was just one waiter who was taking care of everything. 
Now about food - Chicken Kabob were ok but hommos, baba ganoush were straight out of the refrigerator with no flavor. Baba ganoush should have nice smokey flavor but it was completely missing. Pita bread served in packets which is ok but was cold, tasted stale. Falafel should be crunchy but what they served were raw inside, I could pretty much taste the raw batter.

Instead of this place Leh Kabob is much much better place to eat good Mediterranean food at reasonable price."}
{"text":"We love this place.  They know us there and treat us like royalty.  The good and service is always great."}
{"text":"I really love this place!  This is a nice family run business with true pride of ownership. They are always so friendly and the food is always good.  I have never had anything that I did not enjoy!  Simply the best option for kabobs in the southeast side of town. They have also catered a company lunch for me and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"One star for the falafel. Terrible service. We were the only ones in the restaurant and the waiter was so rude. Chatted on his phone. Served us cold bread and insisted that's how they serve it. Had to ask for water. No thank you or bye when we left. Small portions high prices. No thanks. Will never go back again"}
{"text":"Mmmm love this place chicken is perfectly seasoned and so tender. My favorite is the chicken kabob with rice it's so good I haven't really tried other stuff there. But staff is great and I love it's a mother and son duo that opened it."}
{"text":"I've had plenty of kabobs/ grills places in Cali and I definitely needed to try one in Vegas. 

The food here is great! The Soltani's are a must try, definitely coming back! 

Clean nice place with a plasma! Not dirty and grungy.

4 stars because I have a favorite place in Cali and nothing seems to beat it, YET"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times since it opened.  The food is good but I always feel shortchanged when I leave.  It seems overpriced for the amount of food they give you.  And once when I asked to substitute another side for the fries the owner told me no since the other sides were more expensive than the fries.  He actually brought out the gyro with nothing else on the plate.  That really should have been the last time I went there!"}
{"text":"Great place for kebabs.  I love the falafel pita, the pickled veg in it is so good.  My hubby usually gets the mixed grill and it's always a hot.  We have had their meat pies before and they are good, but a little heavy for an app, and too big for two people.  

You wouldn't expect it from the outside, but the inferior is actually quite nice.  They did a good job of making this casual dining spot have a relaxing and clean feel."}
{"text":"I would rate it a 3.8.  The food is very good, but we were disappointed by the portions.  Also service was very slow, the place was understaffed the night we went. Maybe a good lunch place but not coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"I LOVE their food!  It is so flipping good! I recently found this restaurant and I could eat here for every meal! Plus they have really great prices and healthy options like only veggie kabobs or whole wheat pitas, and salad (with Romaine not iceberg likemost restaurants), hummus,  and more!  Mmmm, I'm getting hungry just writing about them!"}
{"text":"Not good... Had the chicken sauté and it was incredibly salty.  I'm actually typing this review as I choke my way through it.  Pretty obvious the chef isn't tasting the sauces.  Chicken is dry and almost minced.  Pita bread is dry and cold.  Comes wrapped in plastic.  Service was fine, not a long wait but I see why.  Just go around the corner to Zen if you want a decent plate of hot food.  I ate because I was hungry but I just can't spend 18 bucks here again."}
{"text":"Liked the Vegetarian combo with all the sampler of fresh Falafel, hummus and all flavors. Will definitely come to check for lunch options here!"}
{"text":"Food was average and way over priced for the portions. Staff was nice, but reserved. Zeitouni in Ballantyne is much better. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love Persian food. This place is amazing. Its clean, fresh, fast and delicious! I ordered the joojeh kabob & beef koobideh with shirazi salad on the side.plus drink included!!! Loved it.

It is a little off the strip but they Said they would deliver for a nominal fee. I just might do that next time in town. 

Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok, let me tell you about this place. FYI: I am a real customer, not a family member. So be warned, this is a real review.

The only thing truly Persian here is the attitude.

I wish this was a friendlier place. The food is ok. Not bad, not great. Has a clean Plebeian atmosphere.

The food is overpriced and they wont give you half rice and half salad with your meal, a standard in Los Angeles. No, you must eat 3 pounds of rice with your meal.

They are also super slow. If there is a line, you will wait!

The Kabob is a little undercooked. No caramelized meat here.

The staff does not know a lick of Farsi. So dont ask for ghormeh sabzi.

They dont have  most home made Persian dishes. 

Why cant they open up an authentic Persian restaurant here?

One more thing, they give you a pat of butter for your rice with the to-go dinner. However, they put it in the same box so if you have to go more then 100 feet before you eat, its melted all over your food. And the close very early."}
{"text":"Food is reliably very good.  The owners run the place and recognize regulars.  Lots of vegetarian options, the food is authentically middle eastern.  The humus and tabouli are excellent.  If you bring your own plates, they will present your take out as if it were your own.  The kabob are always good, get the garlic sauce for the chicken."}
{"text":"I do not recommend. This place is expensive for what it is. They were unaware they even have this Yelp promotion. They hesitantly gave me 10% off one of my entrees but not my entire order. A group of 3 people(that looked like they knew the worker) arrived and placed their order after me, but got their order before me. Just bad customer service."}
{"text":"I live in phoenix, and hadn't found any good mediteranean food since working in charlotte.  Today I finally found some!  I had the moussaka which was wonderful!!!  I finished my plate!  It didn't have a bechemal sauce, which is good since I'm watching calories anyway; but it was packed full of favor.  I also has the hummus and the bakalava, which was excellent!!!  The service was superb and I intend on becoming a regular.  The food is very fresh and flavorful.  It's a steal for what you get.  I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"preeeetty disappointing across the board.

we got the: vegetarian combo (hommos, tabbouleh, baba ghannouj, falafel, spinach pie, grape leaves, and potato harra), beef shwarma, basmati rice, and baklava. here's a breakdown of (most of) the items:

- hommos: 2.5/5; too much tahini and not enough garlic? it was just off. the consistency was fine--creamy and slightly thin--but the taste... mehhhhh.

- tabbouleh: 2.5/5; parsley wasn't chopped into small enough pieces and not enough zing (lemon? spices?). it was like eating stems of parsley covered with olive oil.

- beef shwarma: 1/5; dry, bland, dry, tough, did i mention dry? 

- falafel: 2.5/5; bland, dry... to me, a great falafel is crisp on the outside and dense yet fluffy inside. the falafel here was just hard on the outside and crummy (and crumb-y) on the inside.

- potato harra: 3.5/5; mediterranean home fries. tasty. especially relative to the rest of the meal.

- baklava: 4/5; pretty standard. 

i don't know what to say. i was so excited to go, given its reviews, but this was hands-down the worst meal i've had in charlotte. even the pita was dry and brittle and not tasty. last, but not least, the prices are steep for the quality and type of food. 

no me gusta."}
{"text":"Steak was leather!!!  I have eaten here before and it was never this bad.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! The staff is amazing and so nice. We ran out of Pita and I went to order more, willing to pay and instead the brought more out for us, plus more samples of food to try. Chicken kabob, falafel and gyro, Greek fries and hummus were perfect."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but everytime I have gone there in the last 2 years I have been disappointed - the service was rude and the food seems to have deteriorated. I hope they will go back to being great... On a seperate note, its small and cozy."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. But my toddler and I walked in and were greeted by the grumpiest waitress I've ever met. We decided to do takeout because my daughter was antsy. The waitress stood over me impatiently while I chose from the menu and glared at my daughter. I figured she was having a bad day so I ultimately left a decent tip (for takeout) and a nice note on the receipt. I get home and open the takeout containers...see my photos for what we got. Absolute skimped boxes that hardly look edible. I will NOT be back. Even though I live very close by, oh well."}
{"text":"everything delicious we orderes the spicy chicken & steak kabob & the lamb chop entree again delicious !"}
{"text":"This place totally surprised me. It is basically in a strip mall and isn't too amazing looking from the outside...but holy crap. Outrageously good falafel pita!!  Ughhh I need to go back. I have had some strange falafel in my day...dry..shaped like a marble..etc. This was warm, fresh, moist, just enough spices....mmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Good flavorful food, long wait for food to get done, myself and two kids, above the \"average price\""}
{"text":"Great Kabob place. I always judge kabob places by 2 things, the rice and the sauces and this place kills it for those 2 things. The basmati rice is light and delicious and the dipping sauces are so good I can never decide which one to get so I get all of them and rotate with every bite!"}
{"text":"Kabob grill used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte with it unique feel when you came inside to the authentic staff serving the food. This time when I came in, the decor was much slicker and modern which was still nice and had more of a club type feel. I am assuming to keep trends with other restaurants in the neighborhood. I was astonished at the price increases for their lunch menu!  I am not opposed to paying a higher amount for the food but want a good \"value\" for the experience etc. the main reason I gave the restaurant 3 stars was because I asked for some olive oil to put on my rice and they kept avoiding me asking for it which I thought was extremely weird. They finally came out to say they were \"out.\" What Mediterranean restaurant would you go to that was out of one of the main ingredients in their food?  On the menu, at least 1/2 of the items contained it, so I wondered what did they use in lieu of olive oil. That made me a little nervous considering a lot of times we think we are putting something healthy in our bodies but it could be something completely different."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Shrimp kabob was tasty. chicken kabob was tasty too and very tender. Babaganoosh was very tasty. Fries were normal fries and good. The pita bread wasnt very soft especially around the edge as someone else said. And As other people have mentioned The menu says the plates come with a sauce but I was charged 25 cents for something that was like a pink \"taziki\" sauce?? Dont know. Doesnt make sense for the menu to contradict itself. A little disappointed."}
{"text":"Food here is fresh and tasty.  Come and eat here. Chicken kabobs are marinated,  moist and delicious. We shared an order with a greek salad.  It came with a few slices of pita bread and dill tsatziki sauce. Perfect lunch for two and only $13."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch! I'm a chicken kabob lunch special girl. It's not a large portion, but perfect for lunch. And I love the salad dressing. What is it? 

Small and quaint. The staff is always polite. Food some time takes a little while but they always prepare everything fresh. I've been here many times and will continue to go!"}
{"text":"Great food, fresh, fast and delicious. First visit both my wife and I enjoyed the large combo plates. Hummus was full of flavor and you can taste the freshness, shrimp was flavorful, chicken was popping and the streak was tender. Sides are all just the right portion and the cilantro sauce was very good. Kabob's you have some new customers NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Though I find it slightly pricey for what you get, the food overall is very tasty and I wholeheartedly recommend the Kabob Grill to anyone who is a fan of Mediterranean food. The tabbouleh, potato harra, shawerma, and lamb kabobs (succulent and melt-in-your-mouth good) are particularly worth mentioning. The pickled condiments are excellent too, with a great spicy vinagery taste. The hommos, served with flatbread, is good, very smooth, though I personally prefer a little more lemon. The meat pies and grape leaves were fair; I'd like a little more spices/flavor. They also have a nice selection of wine and beer, including some good, heavy Ukranian (or Baltic?) brews that I haven't had anywhere else. They frequently have coupons in the Ballantyne magazines."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for Middle Eastern food, kids and adults alike. 

The (only?) bad: it's overpriced unfortunately so we go less than we would like. I'm not sure if ownership has changed recently but the last few times the hummus seemed a bit less stellar than usual, hopefully temporary.

The good: I feel like I haven't found a miss here at all in terms of tasty dishes on the menu: smooth creamy hummus, tabbouleh, lamb and chicken kabobs, potatoes harra, even the spicy pickled condiments---all of them are fabulous."}
{"text":"Great spot. Fast service, friendly staff and flavorful food. Apparently they have belly dancers on fridays?"}
{"text":"Came back since this is our favorite spot since it opened and while cutting up the chicken it was still bloody and both my fathers and mine kabobs were still pink inside!!  Definitely will never come back beware!"}
{"text":"Number one spot in Las Vegas 
The best customer service I've been through a kebab restaurants around the area 
 Specially I heard they going under new management and I wish them good luck the food is fantastic definitely I'll come back"}
{"text":"This is the go to place for Mediterranean food. It is very hard to find a good and reasonably priced kabob place in this town but those guys figured out the formula. I always order the chicken kabob it is cooked just perfect. It comes with salad and a tasty side of rice. Did I mention how juicy and tender the lamb chops are ?  Definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"I was originally going to Elixir but apparently they were closed. It was pouring and I was hungry and I saw Kabob Grill glowing in the rain. So nice. Very clean, very friendly, very helpful. And so yummy, especially on a rainy day. If it wasn't so far from me, I would probably be here once a week!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good - I ordered a lamb kebab with a Fattoush salad on the side.  We loved the hummus as well.  The prices were pretty steep for the food you get.  Everything tasted good, but we probably won't return as the prices were way too high for the food we received."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have lunch & dinner
Lovely food prepared daily
Been going there for years and I enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas & I was Craving some Kabob.
I wanted to check out this Restaurant for a Quick Bite.

By far The Hummus I've ever tasted in my entire Life ( & I eat hummus quite often ) 

The Kabob was so fresh & Redicoulsly Tasty.

DEFINITELY 5+ stars & highly Highly Recommended 

I literally asked for the chief to thank him before I left"}
{"text":"Got totally screwed on a gyro for $9. Sign says with rice or fries. I got neither. All I got was attitude and a stare down. Fix the sign. Be courteous to your patrons. Wtf? Surprised I wasn't charged for the foil. Eff this place. Sucks because it is actually pretty good food.

Owner came out and made it right. Bowl of fries and an apology. All good!  New owners. Figuring it out."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit and am always astounded by the poor service given by the owners. I asked for my side salad to be switched out for fries. Their salad is made with cheap lettuce and a disgusting dressing. They can't do it because \"it's a free small salad\", well then why can't you exchange it for free small fries? The cheap fries from a bag you serve can't cost more than the salad. I'm not asking much, throw 6 fries on my plate and make a customer happy. 

The food is pretty good which keeps me coming back for more and is pretty reasonable. Don't go there expecting quick service though. Considering you order at a counter it shouldn't take as long as it does. 

The falafel is a little greasy and I am not even sure if they are homemade. Their hummus is good though. 

I can't account for any of the meat dishes as I am a vegetarian. I also have gotten great service from people who work there who are not the owners. Don't go in expecting to be treated nicely though, go for the cheap mediocre food."}
{"text":"As a Turkish person who just moved to Charlotte, I really wanted to love this place. I went yesterday and soon after we ordered a woman came in to pick up a huge order (something like 6 boxes?) for takeout and she tried to open the boxes to check her order and the only guy working there outside of the kitchen, Omar who  also owns the place, started yelling at her. He has a very thick accent so I couldn't even understand what he was saying but he continued to yell at her while she paid and left. It's a really small place and he was incredibly loud so you could look around and see how uncomfortable all of the people seated at tables were; this man obviously has serious anger issues. Shortly after, he started sneezing by the cash register and so he decided to go inside of the kitchen to continue his sneezing!! He sneezed 3 more times in the kitchen then came outside right away without washing his hands. I wanted to bolt right then and there but this guy is pretty big and we've already seen him angry for no reason so we decided to tough it out. So the sick guy brings out the food, and it was good but the meat was really dry. Anyway I survived, barely, but today I woke up with a sore throat, swollen lymph nodules in my neck, and inflamed sinuses. Never in my life have I seen someone decide to go to the kitchen while on a sneezing spree - this place needs to be checked out by a health inspector. Don't go there unless you want to get sick or possibly get yelled at by a big angry man."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Their rice is a thing of beauty. I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. It's very small but there always seems to be a clean table available. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Food is consistently delicious and my husband loves their baklava."}
{"text":"This place blows even the larger more popular Mediterranean places in town out of the water!

I can't even rave enough about them!

High quality steak and chicken...  Fresh and flavorful hummus...  HIGHLY recommend adding on the roasted tomato!

I look forward to trying the new lamb chops soon!

Kabob Grill is not to be missed, my only complaint is that this successful, family run restaurant is on the opposite side of town. 

Consistency is also a very important quality in a restaurant for me and this has been proven to be the case here. 

Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the new owner chef has over 30 years experience from the best Mediterranean restaurant in Los Angeles. Go try the food and you will be amazed. All recent bad reviews are from past owner friends who are very jealous."}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty new to the area and decided to give this place a try. We ordered our food to go, while waiting  we sat and watched either the manager or owner chastise his only staff member right in front of us because she didn't have an apron (all while holding a brand new one in his hand). This seems pretty petty to complain about but if this was happening right in front of brand new customers what happens behind closed doors. We will not returning, these people don't deserve our money."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal at Kabob grill this evening with my husband. This place is small, no one was waiting for a table but all tables were occupied. Our waiter, Joshua was very courteous and accommodating. We enjoyed the falafel appetizer with tahini, and for our entrees i had the vegetable platter and my husband had the Lamb shawarma. The dishes were tasty and filling- well prepared and well served."}
{"text":"I was driving on eastern looking for something different and healthy.  Went in to Kabob Grill and had their chicken Soltani and it was Awesome. I have been recommending it to Friends since... Their Hummus is to die for (homemade style). They also have a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just realized I haven't reviewed Kabob Grill yet.  This is one of my wife and I's favorites in Charlotte, and the best Mediterranean place we've found in the area. The falafels are great, and they have a number of selections for vegetarians. The staff is also friendly, but not overbearing and the restaurant is comfortable - a good place to go on a date.  Tip: try the Turkish coffee.

Both locations are good - though this one is a little bit more spacious."}
{"text":"Kabob Grill is the closest I've found my my fave middle eastern restaurant back home (Zaytoon's) 

The falafel is perfect, lightly crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside, no hockey puck falafel!  

The hummus is blander than I'm accustomed to, it's very thin as well but still pretty good.  

My complaints are that you can't get wraps after 5 on the weekends ( I had my sights set on a falafel wrap for dinner tonight), the bread is a bit stale & would be better warm and that the hassa potatoes are different every time we go, this time they were blanched & extra spicy, the time before golden brown & mildly spicy.  

My favorite is to get the kafta kabob and double hummus, just like Massoud used to make it at Zaytoon's."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous Mediterranean restaurants in both the QC and Charleston, but this one takes the cake. Awesome variety, and great for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Kabob Grill is a very laid back, excellent, place to enjoy some great Mediterranean food. The grape leaves are top notch, the hummus fantastic, Falafel? Yes do it! Mijaddara is flame, and any of the lamb, chicken plates are very good. The wraps are huge so watch out. This place is small so it's more like a chill spot. The service is always friendly and helpful. There a very few restaurants that are any good in Charlotte, this one is a can't miss. You wont find it in your tourist books, but you should go anyway. If you never had any Mediterranean food this would be a great place to start."}
{"text":"Fantastic! This is a hidden gem and I do not know how I have just tried this place! The service was amazing and the food was delicious! Our server was very attentive (Wish I knew his name) and you get a lot of food at the price point. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had been many times and that's my place when I'm craving kabob. Everything tastes fresh and stuff is very friendly and polite. I recommend to try this restaraunt"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the portions are much too small for the price. They also cook their steaks medium rare, so if you like your steaks well down or even medium well, you need to let them know when you order. 

Staff is friendly and willing to get your food just right."}
{"text":"First time trying Mediterranean food and it was delicious!! I will definitely be back for more, the staff was friendly and informative. Your meals come with sides like : rice, hummus, salad, fries, among other tasty ones. They have different sauces to go with your meal ,i recommend the cilantro sauce. Didn't wait long for our food which was awesome because one of our friends was on her lunch break so gave us time to actually enjoy our food. You also have the option of seating outside and for today that was an awesome option cause the weather was perfect. Try it if your around the area looking for a quick healthy meal."}
{"text":"Great food!! Good quality meat definitely would come back if you like kabobs this is the place to go good evironment and very very clean establishment"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on the wknd and there was one person working the entire room. She finally stopped for a minute to take my order after waiting at the bar for almost 10 mins and she told me it would be 15-20 mins which was fine with me since I had to run to the Teet. 

Well, 30 mins later, I am back and still no food. She forgot to put my order in and at that point I was starving and just wanted my gyro lunch special. They had a nice selection of lunch specials available seven days a wk so I'll give that to them.

I got it and took it home. it was good but nothing to write home about. The lamb wasn't too flavorful and the tsatziki sauce was kinda weak. I would love to check it out again when they have a better service situation going on. I hear their hummus and baba ghannouj is terrific so I think I will be giving them a second chance in hopes of a better experience."}
{"text":"I love kabob grill. Everything I have ordered (which has been pretty much the entire menu) is amazing. The entire staff is friendly, and helpful. I visit kabob grill at least three times a week."}
{"text":"If you want great-tasting and authentic middle eastern food you have to try this place out! All the kabobs are delicious - juicy and full of flavor - but my favorite is the chicken. The portions are huge, the prices are decent and the service is awesome! What more could you ask for? Plus, I don't consider this fast food. It tastes too good to be fast food! Your stomach will always be satisfied after eating here. :)"}
{"text":"This is meant to fix a problem not just rant as I think this is a really good restaurant. Food is very good but they constantly give me inaccurate pick up times on to go orders. They tell me 20 and it takes 35 or 40.
If I knew it was going to be that long, I would just go somewhere else. So frustrating as I'm typically on the go and don't have that kind of time to wait. Management, please fix this problem. Don't provide such a good product and then frustrate your customers with something that is so easy to fix."}
{"text":"Shish Kabob & Chicken Gyro is so good with the Shirazy Salad yummy!!!..;)))"}
{"text":"The food was a bit overpriced, but super-delectable. I got lamb skewers that were to die for and their homemade hummus is delightful. I enjoyed the pickled veggies that they put on my plate as well."}
{"text":"Hella long wait time for a to-go order: I was literally waiting 25 minutes. For a walk-up-and-order establishment,this isn't acceptable- either speed up or offer table service.

Chicken kabob platter came with two skewers, rice or fries, a side salad, and a side: opted for the dolmas. Everything tasted good, including the new cilantro sauce that I was encouraged to try at the register. Dolmas were served warm, the way I like them. Creamy house dressing on the salad is delish.

Suggestions for management: rice is in a cooker, salads and sides should be assembled and ready to go so that only the chicken needs to be made to order. Even from a raw state, this shouldn't be a 25 minute meal. Especially considering you have two guys in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I waited about 30 mins for my kabob meal. It was good actually but the hummus is not that good. It was expensive tho. I paid about $19 for 2 kabobs, salad and hummus with pita bread and I didn't even like the hummus. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"To supplement another reviewer's review who hasn't tried the falafel here... I have tried it and it's wonderful. I do ask for extra sauce though, which I recommend in case you find yourself with falafel-desert-mouth (those things can be dry!!!) The baklava is awesome and inexpensive. There is little seating inside this tiny gem of a find, so I'd bet on take out if you're going at lunchtime. And to make it even easier, call ahead."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a shame! First I stopped by to get some food to go and they didn't took the time to tell me the wait time. I waited for about 20 min to get my food. Then when I arrived home and taste it it was EXTREMELY salty like I've been eating Mediterranean food for while now but this was just gross! First and last time trying this place. Very poor customer service and terrible taste. THE FOOD WAS SO GROSS I HAD TO WRITE A REVIEW!!"}
{"text":"Everything about our visit today was great! Fast and friendly customer service, delicious and fresh food, and super clean! Have the baklava before you leave! Made fresh by owners, not frozen like you get elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel pita wrap to go today....it was outstanding!  I have very specific pregnancy craving...and you guessed it....falafel (that and chicken shawarma.)   With my first pregnancy I drove miles out of the way to get to a shop in downtown san francisco called Baladie.  I was worried I wouldn't find as good a falafel in CLT this time around.  I am SO EXCITED Kabob Grill is near my house!

The falafel pita wrap was just the right size.  It was perfectly proportioned falafel, veggies, and tahini.  

I am a big fan of everything I see on their menu.  I can't wait to come have a full sit-down meal!   I spotted a bottle of Duckhorn red on the bar while I was waiting.  They obviously have excellent taste in wine as well.  MMMMM....delicious."}
{"text":"It was a cold dark night... Actually it was a warm and sunny day! A perfect time to try Kabob Grill.  

We stopped in for lunch.  We were welcomed with friendly smiles and greetings. It's not a huge dining area but very quaint.  Our order was taken promptly being very helpful.  

I tried the regular gyro with wheat pita bread.  On the side I chose hummus which also came with more of their pita bread. The gyro was smaller than other Greek/Mediterranean places but it was good.  They put the tzatziki sauce on the side which was good because I usually take most of it off. Their bread around the gyro and served with the hummus was a little thicker than usual.  It was tasty and very filling.  

I would stop back in again and probably try a kabob or two.  It was a good option for dining in this area."}
{"text":"Great little place for Mediterranean food. My favorite is the gyro salad. They give you plenty of meat and they use romaine lettuce. Dressing is also delicious."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place tons of times and today I finally tried them out. The restaurant is a small space with about 8-10 table inside and probably seats about 10 at the bar. The service was very attentive and pleasant. I ordered the falafel wrap with fries. The falafel had the perfect amount of moisture and the sauce was good as well. The fries were a little soggy but I wasn't there for the fries. I would recommend eating here and getting the falafel wrap (if you are into that kind of thing). I do wish I would have tried the Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"First time - and we'll be back!
Had the Chef's Special of a combo chicken & steak.  Yum!  Tender and juicy and the rice is addicting.  Also had a side of vegetables.  Great combo and plenty of food for two under $20 (used a 10% off coupon from checking in on Yelp)."}
{"text":"My favorite gyro and kabob spot in Las Vegas.  Consistently good quality with superb flavors...  Additionally,  the best tasting rice anywhere!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I grew up in metro Detroit where you can get great Lebanese / Middle Eastern food for a great price.  The food at Kabob grill is probably the best Lebanese food in Charlotte but it's not the great when compared to other places I've had.

The prices are reasonable for being in Dilworth and the servings are pretty decent.  I would come back if I had a craving for some Middle Eastern but wouldn't go out of my way for Kabob Grill."}
{"text":"When I walked in today, I was pleased by how friendly the staff was- this was the most memorable part of my experience. It was obviously my first time, and the cashier was happy to answer my questions and tried his best to describe the rice to me. I should have asked for a sample but I digress.

I ordered the Gyro combo plate, which comes with fries and a fountain drink. I should have ordered an extra side of salad (which comes with the regular gyro wrap, but is replaced by fries in the combo), because the wrap was brimming with delicious meat but could have used more onion and tomato (I like a little more crunch in my gyros). I was also happy that the pita bread was as good as other Yelpers described. You can tell it's fresh. I would have tried the hummus or babaganoush, but was afraid the portion would have been too big for one when followed by a gyro.

Overall, solid place, but definitely wouldn't drive past Yassou! to get here.

PROS:
Friendly Staff
Good Gyros
Tzatziki sauce and pitas were especially wonderful

CONS:
Not enough veggies in the wrap (YES, I SAID IT!!)
No individual appetizers (more of a suggestion)"}
{"text":"Amazing food & exquisite service. If you live in Vegas make sure you stop by Kabob Grill and see for yourself. Fun, different, and authentically Persian. The combination of quantity and festive atmosphere goes hand in hand with the consistent food quality. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! The large platter is so much food. You get the kabobs and 3 sides. The chicken, the chicken shawarma, and the lamb were amazing. The four of us were stuffed and unable to eat everything, but we tried."}
{"text":"This is the best I've had in Vegas as far as Mediterranean food goes.  Quick service, chicken was mouth watering.   Suhad took care of us and the chefs served us.  I felt like I was at my families home cooking.  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We come here every time we are in vegas! The food is very tasty, the staff is always really nice and explains the options, and the wait isn't long. 
The combo plates are generous with delicious jasmine rice, pita bread, and salad. I recommend the falafel wrap - it is huge, fresh, and comes with fries.
Until next time!"}
{"text":"I met a fellow yelper at Kabob Grill last night for supper and dessert (of course!) and it was a great meal from start to finish.  We started with Lentil and Vegetable Soup followed by Baba Ghannouj Dip and Potato Harra - all of which were very good in their own right.  Both soups were served with pita chips and we used some in soup and some to scoop out the Baba Ghannouj Dip (Grilled eggplant, tahini sauce, garlic, parsley and olive oil)...yummy!  

For entree I had the chicken kabob with a side of Potato Harra and Omar's Salad (Lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, green pepper, sweet corn, parsley, dry mint, lemon juice and olive oil) - VERY good!  He ordered the lamb kabob with a side of Tabbouleh (Cracked wheat, parsley, tomato, onion, lemon juice, olive oil and dry mint) and and Omar's Salad as well.  I sampled it all and the only thing I really didn't care for was the pickled veggies that came with the meal...but I happily shared them with my fellow yelper who was a fan!  I sampled his lamb kabob (my first time eating lamb) and I have to say it reminded me of beef, but was very well seasoned and very tasty!

For dessert we had Baklava that was made with pistachio nuts...OH my so yummy! and a very delicious concoction of mango, passionfruit and raspberry sorbet (or gelato, hmmm I'm not sure) but it was presented in a layered ball covered in white chocolate and drzzled with dark...very good!!

Our service was excellent and our waitress never let our glasses get empty and was happy to offer information about the restaurant, it's owners and explanation of the dishes we were unfamiliar with.

I would certainly return here and try something else (or maybe stick with what I got this time...excellent choices)...Great little place nestled in a strip mall, attractive decor but not fussy and a great little gem in amongst Kennilworth Commons!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I guess it will take a few more years for the food scene to mature in Charlotte so that, on future visits, I don't have to deal with the likes of people who run this place. Clear indication that Charlotte needs more authentic Mediterranean establishments. I look forward to finding one on my next visit.
We went there as a group of 5 last week and the place wasn't busy. This was my second visit. The experience was the same as the last one.  Average kabobs, lousy salads, inexperienced wait staff and an incredibly tactless/rude owner (maybe that explains the churn in staff). He clearly should not be in hospitality and food business; especially in the highly hospitable/polite culture of Charlotte. My friend, who lives in Ballantyne and suggested this place, apologized to rest of the group after the meal. Stay away from this place!!"}
{"text":"The food tastes good. A little over priced but I won't be coming here anymore. Waited 45 minutes for two entrees to go and nobody else was in the restaurant, For the entire time."}
{"text":"So, I'm mixed about this place. 

It's a perfect lunch spot--relatively quick, healthy and conveniently located in Dilworth. However, it's a tad overpriced for what you get, which I assume can be attributed to the location and rent.

They have a decent menu of salads, pita wraps, entrees, appetizers, etc. including lunch special combos that are all about $9-$15. If you want just a pita wrap with no sides it's $7.50 and only available until about 5 pm. I opted for the two kabob and two side special which after tax, tip and no drink was about $13. A little expensive for a casual place and to think that I could go to Savor or 300 East instead and spend the same thing is a little disconcerting.

Price aside, the food was pretty good. I got two chicken kabobs with Omar's salad and falafel. The portions were ok, and I was just full after finishing my plate. For $13 though, I could have gotten 2 meals out of a lunch place elsewhere.

The falafel and tahini was my favorite part of the meal. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The salad had a little too much oil for my liking and spread all over the plate making my chicken soggy.

The chicken was decent, not as flavorful as I would have expected.

I was impressed with the beautiful presentation of the plates and with how fresh all the ingredients seemed to be. The service was just okay and it took longer than I would have liked to pay and get the checks, especially during a workday lunch.

I think I'll return to this place just because it is really the only decent lunch spot convenient in Dilworth that offers authentic Mediterranean fare."}
{"text":"Food was good albeit expensive, but the girl working there was rude when I was trying to be nice. There are so many great places to eat in charlotte, I will not go to a place where the staff is rude. There is some really great \"med\" places to eat at on South blvd that will be getting my business instead."}
{"text":"Excellent menu options.  We loved everything.  I ordered a salad with a chicken kabob and side of hummus.  My husband ordered the shawamara platter.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. It's not your typical kabob grill. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food is amazing. They have many side options to choose from but I recommend the hummus. A typical lunch plate costs about $10 but I spend that when I go to panera or anywhere else and this food far exceeds."}
{"text":"The owner of this place just told me that after 20 years in business, he doesn't care anymore. Doesn't care that they botched my order. Doesn't care that I was a little upset about it. Doesn't care if the place ever gets another order right. So when the owner of the business says to a customer that he doesn't care anymore, you can pretty much believe he doesn't care anymore. The food used to be very good but it has gone downhill anyway. So steer clear."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. I would eat here every night if I could. The chicken Kebob, potatoes and toubilee  (sp?) are to die for. Also make sure you get desert as well."}
{"text":"For dinner, the kabob combo rocks, with chicken, beef and kefta kabob.  Kefta is like a ground beef link, a little spicy, definitely out of the ordinary.  Their hummos is a little peanuty for my taste but it's made fresh.  The bread is also thinner than I'm used to but it's probably a regional thing and of course I didn't go home hungry.  

For lunch this is the only place I've ever paid over $7 for a falafel sandwich and a side of hummos.  I wish they'd move for cheaper rent so they can knock two bucks off everything on the menu.  Then I'd eat here twice a week instead of once a month.  They could also double the size of the dining room and still keep it packed.  It's good enough I'd follow them wherever they go...  Alas, I haven't been in a long time because it's ridiculous to pay more than $5 for a falafel sandwich."}
{"text":"I've only tried the gyro and loved it.  Place is very clean, prices are affordable and staff is friendly.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This spot use to be my favorite Mediterranean food but the last few time have been a disappointment. I'm guessing because now that they're under new management. The meat is dry, they charge for sauce now and the sauces taste different. I am very sad that a lot of things changed :("}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Had the mixed grill - but wasn't too crazy about the falafels. It's ok not a deal breaker. The server who I think is also the owner was very pleasant and I sensed no kind of rudeness - as other reviewers had mentioned. Total sucker for Mediterranean food and will most likely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Super fresh always made to your order. The lady is super nice always great food!!"}
{"text":"Had my 1st time lunch today with my woman here at the kabob grill and we both enjoyed it very much. Hummus was good, grilled chicken kabobs were real good with a kickin garlic sauce and we got 3 sides. It was cool that they were playing Sinatra but we are in Vegas yo? We are already talking about going back,soon."}
{"text":"They keep getting better and better overall. The service & food on our visit last night was oustanding! We both throughly enjoyed this visit so much! 

Tim decided to order the mixed grill kabob plate so that he could try all the meats. For his side items, he went with basmati rice and Omar's salad and also ordered a side of the homemade garlic sauce. He was thrilled with the flavors of everything.  The garlic sauce was thick & the consistency was more like a spread than a sauce...it looked sort of like white butter. But it had a really nice flavor & was not too much.

I went with my usual - vegetarian  combo plate that included falafel (which was slightly  over-crispy on the outside but moist on the inside).  I cant remember if they offer tahini or not...but that was the one thing my falafel was missing.  The hommos was delicious as usual & I really enjoyed the baba ghannouj this time. Spinch pie was so-so as usual... I really do wish it was a little more flavorful. I also had Potato Harra which was delicious, as always. Since I am not a fan of yalanji or tabbouleh, I asked to sub mijaddara for that. It was good but not quite as flavorful as I had remembered it to be. But overall, the quality of my food was very good.

We also ordered a bottle of wine...  the Charles & Charles Cab/Syrah blend. This wine paired so nicely with our food and really enhanced our enjoyment of both.  

After dinner, we decided to split a piece of cheesecake with chocolate drizzled over it. This also paired quite nicely with the wine. In all, we spent around $75 before tip, which is very reasonable for our enjoyment of this meal! 

We had considered doing hooka after dinner while we finished our wine but decided we will come back soon and do that after having appetizers instead. 

I am so glad they got rid of the belly-dancers they used to have on Fri or Sat nights when they first opened this location. The place is definitely too small and intimate for that."}
{"text":"The Kabob Grill is consistently one of our favorite restaurants. We have eaten at the East Blvd location several times, but now that they also have a Stonecrest location, we can enjoy  it a lot more often.  The quality of the food is outstanding.  They have the best house-made hummus in Charlotte. The Lentil soup is excellent  as is most of the vegetarian options - baba gannouj, falafel, potato harra, and spinach pies are my favs.  The chicken kabobs and basmati rice are excellent too.  The service is very good.  The only time I don't like to go is when they have the bellydancer - I think the restaurant is a little too small for that ... if they had a \"stage\" where diners could watch the \"show\"  without  having their \"table space\" invaded, it would be a lot more enjoyable.  I love the decor of both locations."}
{"text":"What's up with this place always running out of the ground beef kabobs??? I come specifically for this dish and they always run out. Apparently they ran out this morning and it is now 6pm and since then have not made more. I doubt I'll be coming in without calling ahead to see if they have ground beef kabobs. I'm pretty disappointed with their lack of preparation otherwise I would give them a 5 because the food is pretty good here."}
{"text":"Order delivery twice from here and they are super fast. Very nice people :-) and the food is good and the portions are huge I had food for three days!! Awesome."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Combo
Hommos, tabbouleh, baba ghannouj, falafel, spinach pie, yalanji and potato harra for $14.  Plenty to share.  They also offer kabobs and wraps.  I tried the lentil soup today, yellow lentils and spices, puréed to  a smooth consistency.  Very tasty!

Kabob Grill is located in the  Stonecrest shopping center, on the side facing the movie theatre. It is kind of tucked away.  There are also a few tables on the sidewalk for outside seating."}
{"text":"I work right upstairs!  They deliver! :P

I've had this place quite a bit..and I enjoy it every time.  I especially love the tzatziki sauce.  

I actually had my first gyro experience unbeknownst to me that it was in fact lamb.  I forgot that I wanted a beef gyro instead... and ended up with the lamb.   Though I don't want to knock it, it was delicious... but lamb texture is not what I'm used to.  For some reason I was a little queasy, which I'd like to say now that I'm sure it was just me... and not the food.  I enjoyed it!  But there was just something unsettling about eating lamb.  ... but that's just me.  

Second time around I had the single ground beef kabob and it was delicious!  I had it with rice, pita bread, & grilled onion and tomato... Love this and had  it a couple other times following...

I've also had a beef wrap which I very much enjoy... but not as much as the ground beef kabob with the rice.. 

Again, I love the tzatziki sauce... with EVERYTHING and not just the salad.  

Since I work right upstairs, I will probably become a duchess or regular sometime soon!  I've very happy that it's in this plaza...

[WHICH IS A BAD ASS PLAZA... it has EVERYTHING!]"}
{"text":"I stumbled in here after getting my eyebrows done (see my review - Idolize Brows & Beauty) it wasn't somewhere I'd go out of my way for. Falafels were crisp and tasty but the rest of the veggie platter seemed to be already made so not too fresh. Babaganoush and hummus was OK not too flavorful - the spinach pie seemed undercooked (had only one bite) and the pita bread was not warm (also only one bite). I ordered to take away but when I stepped inside the restaurant it seemed like a pretty decent spot - clean with lots of space!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has a 4 star review... if you read past reviews it seems like the good ones are from a previous owner.

The food here was beyond terrible! If you are looking for any kind of authentic Mediterranean food, THIS IS NOT the spot. There is nothing authentic or remotely close. 

The rice was instant nasty soggy rice, the beef kabob tasted like the meat was old. The chicken shawarma was dry... I know I thought it's impossible to mess up chicken shawarma, but this place took that to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Dilworth-centric, easily reached on bike, dine in or takeout, and full spread of Mediterranean favorites. We decided to try out this location after loving the location in Stonecrest. Happy to say it delivers just the same...and the same is damn good.

Went with a menagerie of menu items: Potato Harra (one of my all-time favorites), Hommos and pita, falafel, tabbouleh, and a shawarma gyro. Decided to grab all of these to-go.

Goodness. There was nothing left once we were done eating. The hommos is sooooo creamy. Not a speck of grittiness to be found. The falafel is crispy and herby and works great on its own or in a pita as a gyro. The tabbouleh isn't my favorite, but the addition of bulgur wheat is nice. The shawarma is my favorite. Great size for a meal and love the pickles that they serve alongside and inside of the wrap. I'd love to know if they make them in-house. 

Happy to report it's just as good as Stonecrest and we're happy to have it close to home!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Got the chicken kabob plate and grape leaves, and it was delightful.

Only leaving only 3 stars because of a weird service issue. My three friends and I were eating and having a great time, laughing and just being grateful that it was Friday. Not like drinking or being rowdy or anything, just talking and laughing. We had been there probably 45 mins eating (we also got desert/baklava), and were just getting up to leave, and a man from the back came and took our plates and we thanked him for the great food. He said something like \"thank you and since you're a little loud, maybe it's time for you to go, since we have other customers that may be bothered.\" He said this without making eye contact, then basically faded into the back again. We all looked at each other like \"did he really just say that?\" First of all... there wasn't any other customers in the place... so not like anyone could have complained about us... it was just bizarre.

I mean, we were already standing getting ready to leave--just such a weird thing to say to us, and we were already leaving...

Safe to say, I don't think any of us will feel comfortable eating there again, which is a shame really, because the food was great and it's literally just down the road from us. Just left a weird taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"Decent food but it's overpriced and not a big portion. We were here before and I was a bit disappointed this time. The pita was cold from the fridge. The falafel was not fresh. The lamb kabob was good. The baklava comes premade. The rice seemed to be old. No thanks."}
{"text":"Man, what a disappointment. We have been to this place several times and now that there are new owners, it is just not the same. Everything tastes different now and not in a good way. Even the beef skewer was dry and overcooked. We definitely will be looking for another kabob place to start eating at."}
{"text":"I Drive 30 Miles Just To Eat Here Twice A Month With My 14 Year Old Son.
We Are Both VERY PICKY Eaters.
Every Time This Place Is Great.
People Complain About Wait Time's ? ? ?
It's Because They Cook They Meat's Fresh ! ! ! 
Can't Wait Till Next Time."}
{"text":"WoW!!!! I was in Henderson for a doctor's appointment and decided to pick up Persian food for dinner. Checked out Yelp saw this place was close to where I had to go and tried it, based on other Yelper's reviews. Boy did they get this place right on.......the BEST Persian food I've had in Las Vegas since transferring to Vegas from L.A. a couple of years ago. Kabob's are so fresh , store immaculate, and service staff awesome. Houman was wonderful taking the phone order, and very helpful, making sure he got the order right and advising on a couple of choices I was unsure about. The freshest food, and best quality of  fresh meats, spices , veggies ever. Would make the trip from Summerlin again for this kind of quality. Thanks so much....everything was awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars because it's fast, soooo tasty, reasonably priced, and they have lots of somagh on deck for the rice. Not in those little packets either! Take it from me (I'm Persian) , I know good kabobs and this place is super awesome!"}
{"text":"I had din din here with a friend & it was absolutely delicious. It was our first time & it did not disappoint us. The price is totally worth it for the amount of food you get. We got the chicken skewers with falafel & grape leaves as a side. It was a good Mediterranean food ."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town until they pulled the Mihammara from the side items list -- I used to literally drive 25 mins to pick up one of their Kabob dinners. Now the Mihammara is only available as a pricey appetizer. Ironically, the Ballantyne location did the very same thing and they're now out of business....go figure. 

When I recently called to place an order to go, the lady on the phone tells me that they were making a special accommodation for me -- total rubbish because I've seen it on the menu with my own eyes (as a side item); see bottom of attached pic. 

The place was remodeled not too long ago and the prices raised thereafter.  Fine....cost of doing business and passing it along; I accepted that. Nickel and dime-ing on the menu.....seriously?

To the lady that owns the place.....please don't alienate your loyal clients!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much our go-to lazy weeknight delivery place. 

Hummus and babaghanoush are outstanding, and the portions are great, if you get the sampler it's easily enough food for 2-3 people. 
They also have the best falafel I've had in a long time. 

The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is they don't deliver after 7:00 pm, when I asked them why, they said because they close at 9:00. It obviously doesn't take more than 2 hours for this kind of food, so that was a little confusing, and just a little inconvenient."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Nabeel salad. The kabobs were good. Im used to having a more meat with kabobs at ither places but the taste was delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped into this place one night to grab a quick dinner.

 As you can see from my other reviews, I am a big Mediterranean food eater. I definitely felt like this was up there with one of the top Mediterranean spots I've tried in the valley. 

I found the prices to be reasonable and the food to be very good. The chicken was moist the rice was plentiful and the bread was warm.

If I'm in the area and looking for Mediterranean, I will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"\"Yo, Gurt, you know kaBob?  No, but we might recognize it if you Hummus a few bars.\"

I've had my share of Mediterranean food.  In fact, Middle Eastern is among my favorite cuisines.  So who would have thought I would find the best kafta I've ever had in Charlotte, of all places.  Perfectly spiced.  Juicy.  Fantastic.

Food.
As I mentioned, the kafta was awesome.  The \"hommos\"/hummus was nice and rich, with a little olive oil drizzle in the middle.  And the falafel was hot and moist, which is no small feat.  I was very impressed with the food.

Space.
There isn't a ton of seating, but there is a fairly large bar area where I assume you could order dinner, and there are a few outside tables.  We went on a Tuesday night, and there wasn't a problem getting a table.

Portions.
My kafta entree included three fairly large kafta kabobs, two \"delightful side items\" (hummus and falafel in my case), mixed vegetables, and 5 pieces of pita.  I was pretty hungry going in, but was barely able to finish everything.  If you think you might need more food, order a couple of appetizers, but KG's portions were the same as, or larger than the portions I've seen at similar restaurants.

Prices.
We only had entrees, but overall, the prices seemed appropriate.  The prices for wine by the glass seemed a little high ($7-8), but the pours were pretty generous, so I wouldn't consider them completely unreasonable.

They could warm the pita and drop the prices of wine by the glass by $1 or $2, but this is nitpicking.  The food is great, and the service is friendly and attentive.  We will be back soon and often.

Kabob Grill, you are my Gyro!"}
{"text":"The food is quite good and KG is probably the only place you'll find Palestinian eats!  

Service is hit or miss. There is usually only one man on and he deals the entire front of the house, taking/placing phone orders and serving. When I've ordered food to go, I felt the portions were much too small. the take out containers literally contained a spoonful of food. 

It's nice to have authentic ethnic cuisine, but the service inconsistencies have kept me from eating here more often than I'd like."}
{"text":"I loved this place! To be fair and honest, I was only inside for literally 2 seconds. That's only because I ordered through their app. I was in the mood for Mediterranean and the place I usually go to is closed on Sunday's. I googled similar places near me and this caught me eye. Loved being able to order through the app as well as pay! Food was delicious! I got the gyro platter, SO GOOD! And three sides! It was awesome. I had half for lunch and half for dinner. Great price for the amount I paid. Can't wait to eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Hands down - Kabob Grill has the best hummus in town! This review is for the Stonecrest location. The service and food is great and consistent. Some of my favorites are the kibbeh (who doesn't like football shaped food filled with meat?),Nabeel's salad, and the chicken kabobs.  The entrees come with two sides, I recommend the potato hara and the hummus - they are both really, really tasty."}
{"text":"Best hummus!!  We've been on the Mediterranean streak lately and I've gotta say, Kabob Grill is right up there with the best.  We ordered the Large Chicken Kabob Plater ($11.99) and the Chicken Wrap ($8.99) with side salads and Hummus. Chicken is outstanding.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area and decided to give the place a try. You will miss it if you blink and not familiar with the area but once you have tried the food you will remember its location. Quite small on the inside but warm and welcoming. Service was fast and pleasant many repeat customers. We tried the kebab and lentil soup. Both were full of genuine flavor. You can tell time, love and authentic experience goes into the flavor and selection. When I say flavor we enjoyed the freshly cooked lamb, chicken and veggies that had its owe unique flavor that when combined were enjoyable. We will return to try other create combinations. 

Take time to review the menu if you can to familiar yourself as the place is busy. 

Inexpensive delight worth the return."}
{"text":"One night my family and I decided to go to Stonecrest on a Sat night without making reservations.  Of course everything was packed!  Finally we decided to try Kabob Grill.  We walked in and got a table without any problem.  The food was really good.  I had some sort of chicken dish with vegetables and it was very good.  If you like Mediterranean food you will like definately like this place."}
{"text":"First time here ... it was alright. i ordered the chicken kabob nothing special and nothing bad. The service seemed kinda slow. Chicken was tender the rice tasted buttery. Give it a try you might like it. For me i think i will pass next time."}
{"text":"Person in front of us complained about their wrong order, then 10 min later i was helped. Employee was flustered and rude. He answered the phone in the middle of tsking sn order and instead of puting them on hold talked to them for literally 10 min, which is a long time. Then he stopped to tell the lady cook how to do orders, seriously?! Then he took my order, everyone else waiting for their food had problems with their order and how long it took. I waited 45 MINUTES FOR MY FOOD AT A COUNTER ORDERED JOINT!!! They forgot my baklava, and i ordered seasoned fries, i got none, then asked about it and mentioned how long it took and he honestly said these words exactly, \"I can just give you your money back and you can go to a fast food place.\" Are you kidding me! I had to be somewhere for work and if I am a very kind, patient person, because I work in the F&B industry but never in my life have I ever had this worse of service. I wish I could give them 0 stars. I was floored!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the lamb & chicken kabobs and they were great. Falafel and cucumber yogurt sauce are a must! Service was ok, not excellent. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time yesterday and had to come back again today.... Fresh, delicious and definitely has it's own touch. I love Mediterranean and this is my new #FAV!"}
{"text":"Let me say that my palate is pretty vanilla. I don't really like to dive into new cuisines. A coworker convinced me to try this place during lunch, and I did so hesitantly.

I stuck with something simply - chicken kabob lunch special which was about $9 bucks. It came with a drink, salad, rice, grilled veggies pita and of course chicken.

To my surprise it was actually good stuff. The rice melted in my mouth, and was nicely decorated with a sprinkle of saffron flavored rice. The chicken was moist. Even the salad was amazing, and I usually don't like greens. It had a very tasty dressing, which made it irresistible. 

I have been back a couple of times, and will be back. I will say that you don't get that much chicken, so if you're really hungry order a double kabob.

Other than that - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Eastern's hidden Mediterranean jewel: Kabob Grill.  

It's not your typical Greek fare with the blue and white decor, cheesy photos on the walls (and or a mural).. No, it very much feels like a fast foodie sort of place with the exception that the place is super clean, not tacky, and I concur with other people's comments about the stellar service.

The food was outstanding!!! I ordered the chicken salad (thanks to the Yelper that recommended this) and my boss ordered the Gyro lunch special.  We both agreed that the salad dressing was incredible!  Alas, everything looked so delicious (and after confirming this with one bite), I ate my entire meal without so much as a thought to take a photo of it. I'm sorry :( 

Bright side is, I crave delicious Greek eats often so there will be future opportunities for me to try and capture the tastiness in a photograph.

There were complaints about price, and sure, they are a bit high but consider this: have you really come across quality ingredients, friendly staff, clean establishment, and delicious food that IS super cheap? Ok, maybe, but it's rare.

D-LICIOUS. That is all."}
{"text":"Great selection.  Excellent food.  Never fails.  Leave stuffed."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  I am new to Charlotte and stopped in for lunch today.  Had a chicken kabob with Omar's salad.  Small but very nice atmosphere.  Staff friendly.  Food great."}
{"text":"This is a review of our visit this week.  This was our second visit as we always give places a second chance.  Our first visit was when they had just opened and so it's been a while now.  I had the falafel wrap ($6.99) and the eggplant dip ($5.99) with a side of rice ($3.99).  My hubby had the falafel wrap ($6.99) and a grilled chicken wrap ($6.99).  Our order came up to about $30 after we received 10% off from checking in on Yelp.  When we walked in there was a group of 4 ladies eating dinner.  We overheard them talking about their food saying how good it was so we were very excited to get our food in hopes that it is better the second time around.  We ordered for take out.  The order took longer then the normal wait for the place to be empty but we were in no rush.  

After we received our order, we rushed home to eat.  The eggplant dip (Grilled seasoned eggplants blended with roasted tomatoes, eggs, and garlic sauce.) was served with warm pita bread was out of this world!  From what I remember of their baba ganoush...this is certainly much better as I didn't care much for the other (and I love just about every eggplant dish there is!).  I ate the dip with the pita and also on top of my side of rice.  The rice was also amazingly nice and fluffy; however very greasy from the looks of the bottom of the to go box.  It didn't stop me from inhaling all of the rice.  My wrap was filled with 3 good portions of falafel.  It was served with a side of salad (nothing special as it was just some ice berg lettuce thrown in the to go box).  There was also a side of Tahini sauce which went well on top of the wrap.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This establishment is by far the best place in Henderson & Vegas area for true, authentic yummy and Juicy tasting Middle Eastern / Persian kabobs and foods. Your food is made or grilled fresh to order like home cooked meal!  I like this place alot because the food freshness, taste and consistency is always great and dependable. Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and the best bang for your buck. For apetizer try their Eggplant Salad which is a combination of grilled eggplant, tomato and a hint of garlic mashed together like baba ganoush or homus dips. You can enjoy it with Pita bread!  By the way, this dish is a special dish from the Caspian region and is called \"Mirza Gasemi\".  It tastes much better than homus and baba ganoush.  Try it and you will see what I mean."}
{"text":"You know it's going to be a good place when the place is filled with Mediterranean people! I ordered take out because I didn't realize the place was so nice and that it's really a place to sit and enjoy the food. I ended up getting the vegetarian combo which included hommos, tabbouleh, baba ghannouj, falafel, spinach pie, yalanji and potato harra. This was all accompanied with pita bread. I foind the potato harra a little too acidic and the overall meal was a little too salty for my liking. I also would have liked some tzatziki sauce on the side. Overall, the place was really nice and the service was great. I combo platter was large and I was unable to eat it in one setting which isn't a complaint because these leftovers were yummy!"}
{"text":"So last time I came here, I left without food because they had run out of gyro meat. Now I know why. I could eat a metric ton of the stuff! 

I had a gyro combo (there's a picture here somewhere!) to go. I'm pretty sure there were angels singing somewhere when I opened the box. There was a pile of fries, a small cup of ketchup (how thoughtful!), a big cup of tzatziki sauce (literally, about a cup of sauce) and the foil wrapped gyro. The gyro itself had tomato and onion slices, a bit of parsley and a heap of meat so big it didn't quite fit in the pita. That meat...mmmm. Perfectly spiced and sliced! The whole thing was huge and I snarfed it down with gusto!

Plenty of delicious food at the right price. I can't wait to go back and try some more of their menu. There are some very Mediterranean items on it, but this restaurant makes them seem completely accessible, rather than intimidating."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and this place is so good it's my new \"go to\". The food is delicious and the owner is such a sweetheart. We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Best kabob in Vegas!!! The chicken is delicious!!! The taste is what has me addicted!! The quality of the food is great! Juicy and fresh. Great portion!! The baklava is really yummy!!! Sweet and moist! The hummus is really good, and I'm really picky with hummus so that's a lot coming from me. The customer service is spot on!! They are always very kind to me and serve me with integrity, you can tell they are passionate about their business. I love meeting my friends here to eat and catch up, or even to grab some take out. Great place and awesome food!!! Definitely go check it out if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"It's so good! The first time I ate there I developed a craving for it. I literally travel from Summerlin which could be A 45 minute drive depending on traffic. It's worth it. They give you so much delicious food for a great price.  The staff is awesome and super friendly.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been on a Mediterranean kick this week, so I decided to have lunch here at Kabob Grill. The place is small but nice and was very clean when I walked in. I ordered the #1 - Steak kabob platter. The good was great. It came out pretty quickly and they had a good range of add-ons. The steak was tender and juicy and the salad was crisp and super fresh. There was a large portion of rice and the meal was super filling."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the same complex that I work in and I find myself going there far too often. The food is very good and always prepared fresh when you order. Pricing is reasonable, and there is hardly ever a wait as the staff is very prompt. They keep everything clean and the menu is easy to understand. My wife loves the Mediterranean salad and they are kebabs are excellent!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food NEW OWNERS try the garlic sauce it's out of this world. We've been here everyday for the past week.  Come here its great you won't regret."}
{"text":"Still a favorite...however, this last visit slightly disappointed. For the prices of the entrees, the quality has to be top notch all the time. I found the grape leaves to be salty and the tabbouleh didn't taste as fresh as we've had there before. The rest was very pleasant: falafel was delicious, hummus was great, and the potatoes were scrumptious."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious Greek food. Try it out as these guys deserve your business"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday around noon for lunch. I hadn't had Mediterranean food in a while and the craving needed to be satisfied, so we decided to give this place a try. 

The inside is VERY small, and there was nowhere to sit, we ended up having to share a table with another group of people we didn't know. Very tight/small arrangement. The inside was very clean though and well kept. Very bright and lively colors. 

The young lady at the check-in counter was friendly. And they bus your dishes for you, which is always an extra nice touch at these \"semi-fast\" type restaurants. 

The food...was overall just bland. The kabob was decently cooked but had no seasoning. Even the tzatziki sauce was super bland and underwhelming (something I normally inhale and smother all over everything). The falafels were probably the best part of the meal as they were still pretty moist on the inside. 

There are so many places in this area to get kabobs, and I just can't justify returning for the bland flavors."}
{"text":"i thought i had reviewed ye olde kabob grille before, but i guess not! 
hummus is good, the wraps are good, everything i've had is good. what is listed on the menu as a gyro is also good, but is not what i was hoping for when i ordered (probably a lot more traditional). the flavors are expertly matched and your mouth waters just walking in the door. 
beware, it's small though; maybe 6-8 tables inside and bar seating."}
{"text":"One of the more disappointing wrap experience that I've had. 
I got the lamb wrap. Barely any meat, mostly pita and lettuce. No distinct flavor. 
Ordered for pick up and told them that I was going to pick it up at noon, when I got there it was waiting for me, but it was luke warm at best, so my guess is that it's been sitting on the counter for 45 minutes. The waitress was short and impolite on the phone, and her demeanor in person wasn't that great either.
Costs over $8 with tax and doesn't even come with a side. 
If I wanted a bland luke warm sandwich, I would have gone to Subway and paid less. 
Not worth it for the prices that they charge. 

The only positive, the lamb was pretty tender; the two tiny pieces that I actually tasted in my sandwich."}
{"text":"It's a bit hard to find as it is on the side of the shopping center but in my opinion is worth a try. I like that there are a variety of side options to choose from.   I ordered the chicken kabobs with falafel, hummus, pita, rice and garlic sauce.  It was delicious! The falafel was my favorite.  Great little Mediterranean restaurant. Only downside is that there was only one waiter and it is a little pricey for lunch."}
{"text":"Love the Gyro Sandwich combo. Rice instead of fries."}
{"text":"I chose this place as a catch-up dinner place for my friend and I's small reunion dinner after seeing the awesome Yelp reviews.  However, this was the first (and hopefully only) time that Yelp has let me down. 

Let me start off by saying that the restaurant ambiance doesn't live up to its steep prices.  When I walk in, I see a place where I spend 10$ a dish max but that price will only cover an appetizer.  Besides the pita wraps, all of the main dishes offered are $15+.  

The customer service was horrible.  The worst part of the experience was when my friend asked to replace her Tabbouleh salad with another, as it wasn't to her liking.  The waiter looked at her, obviously unhappy, and asked if she had taken a bite out of it because if that was the case then they would have to toss the whole dish. We could have just as easily lied that we didn't touch it.  In that case, it's disturbing to think that someone else would be given the food served to us (what else would they do with a dish if they don't toss it?).   It's even more disturbing to think that my food could have been returned to the kitchen as well.... 

Furthermore, after we asked for a replacement, the waiter never once came by to our table to ask if we needed anything else.  It took like 10 minutes just to get his attention for the check.  Of course, besides this, there were other problems like long waiting times and being generally unattentive from the beginning but they're things that I would have probably overlooked if everything had gone smoothly.. but it didn't.. so..."}
{"text":"I have to give these nice folks very high marks!  The food was delicious and I was very happy with the way the staff paid attention to the questions my fiance and I had before ordering (which is very important because both of us have food allergies.) 

They were patient to listen and answer our questions and customized a few things for us. The waitress was pleasant and efficient. The owner helped out with following up on drink refills when the waitress was busy.  Everything was fresh and the quality of the food was excellent.  

I've honestly never much been a fan of Mediterranean food, but my fiance loves it so I figured I would just go along for the ride.  I ended up thoroughly enjoying the entire experience and I liked it enough to save it in my GPS for future reference.  You could say they've made me a convert!"}
{"text":"I wasn't to awfully impressed with this place. The food was quite bland and the restaurant is very small. They had the temperature what felt like close to freeze so it was very uncomfortable. I got the chicken wrap which came with fries and the only thing I would say was great about it was the sauce. My date had the Lamb skewers and he said they were very good but it was over priced. Overall it's not a place I would crave or go out of my way to go too. I might would give it a second chance if I was in the area."}
{"text":"What a shame this place used to be real good. The quality of food has gone down since the new ownership took over. The food is just \"ok\" And they are now closed on Sundays. I hate to say it but this place had a strong customer base and now I would not be surprised if the doors were shut for good in the next few months. Sorry"}
{"text":"After coming here on occasion for a couple years now something came to me the other night when I stopped in for takeout. This place is far too expensive for what you get! Admittedly, I should've had this culinary epiphany ages ago but my experience the other night leads me to believe there's no going back now. 

I ordered two wraps (1 lamb, 1 halloum) and two pieces of the almond and mascarpone cake for my girlfriend and I. Any guesses what these 4 items costs me? I can wait. Cue Jeopardy theme.

$31. THIRTY-ONE DOLLARS!!! These wraps didn't even include a side item. If they'd come with sides I could see paying $20-$25. But without sides I really think it shouldn't have been more than about $20. 

To their credit, the food is always done well. The hummus, baba ghanoush, kefta kabobs, fattoush and potato harrah are particularly noteworthy. The hazelnut and chocolate cake with a Turkish coffee is Jannah materialized.. And on top of all this, the service is always friendly and attentive.

I really hate giving Kabob Grill such a low rating. Were it not for the price and the fact that you can get similar stuff for way cheaper elsewhere they'd get a solid 4 stars from me. But the prices should only be about 2/3 of what they are. Maybe I'll still come in for dessert and Turkish coffee from time to time but that's it. The competition is doing just as well in the taste and quality departments and they're doing it for a lot less."}
{"text":"If you love Mediterranean food, this is a great place to dine on the southeast side! 

Although its a fast food spot. The food was as good as any sit down dinner that I have experience. 

I ordered the appetizer sampler where you get to pick 3. I chose hummus, babaghanoosh and tabolleh salad. Served with lots of warm pita bread, this is enough for more than 2. After eating all of the tabolleh which was fresh and lemony, I then tried the hummus and babghanoosh. Both full of flavor. Plenty left over to take home along with the pita bread. 

Looking forward to having the leftovers tomorrow. I'll be going back to try a beef kabob soon. I'll be sure and take someone with me so I can have it and split some more appetizers."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stumbled upon this little gem while shopping at the adjoining Harris Teeter. I am a tough critic when it comes to Kabobs coz I grew up in India and had the best street kabobs near my home. But I gotta say that Kabob grill had some pretty authentic kabobs and awesome pillaf! I love the smoky flavor of the meat and the raita (yogurt side dish) was absolutely delicious. It is priced well and we had really attentive service staff. The restaurant itself is non pretentious and has a very homey feeling. All in all a wonderful dining experience....we will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Great middle eastern and Mediterranean food; decent prices. The hummus is excellent as is the kafta. The place is right next to the movie theaters in stone crest off Rea road. Try it next time you catch a movie."}
{"text":"This place been here for a while and finally stopped to give it a try. Glad we did. The service is good and the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Everything we had was delicious! Chicken was cooked absolutely perfect! House dressing on the salad was bomb! Rice was on point! Hummus was great & the pita was the perfect balance between soft & not too thick! But surprisingly, the highlight of my meal was the KRAZY FRIES! I think I may love them even more than my SD Carne asada fries! Whaaaaaaaat?!?!!!???! U gotta try it!!

And the icing on the cake... FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! It just doesn't get any better than this!

P.S. they offer loyalty cards! Buy 8 meals, get one freeeeeeee"}
{"text":"BAD! BAD! BAD!  Don't waste your time or $$$.  This used to be our go to Mediterranean restaurant.  New owners and the quality has gone way down!
Both chicken kabobs were way under cooked, raw in the middle.  
Sauces are watered down.
Rice is is blah!
Salads was unappetizing.
Pita bread, unexplainable,....really bad.

Did I say how really BAD this place is!"}
{"text":"How can you get great Middle Eastern food without flying to the Middle East??? Have someone in the middle east ship it to you... No, silly - just head over to Kabob Grill. The food is prepared daily and is as fresh as it can get. Hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, potatoes are some of my many favorites. But, you can't go to Kabob Grill without getting a Kabob... try the lamb or kafta for a change or just \"stick\" to the beef or chicken, you won't be disappointed. All the meats are seasoned, not fatty and are lean cuts. Writing this review is making me hungry for one of my Charlotte's top favorites - Kabob Grill."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and healthy. Great little place for lunch and dinner. Staff is very attentive and the food tastes very fresh every time. This has become one of my staples!"}
{"text":"Great place... the owners are very nice... they have great hummus, tabloi (sp) and awesome Kidby... i used to get take out all the time... you have to check it out..."}
{"text":"Found this place off yelp and decided to try something new, diff, and just not fried!  

The inside is actually kinda cozy. The food was a little foreign at first as we were not sure of some of the names. However the waiter was polite and personable and didn't mind explaining our questions.  

We had lentil soup, Omar salad, and rice with lamb meat! Everything was absolutely delish! The colors were amazing to look at which made it that much more fun and enjoyable to eat.  

They have all kinds of foreign beer.  We are from Ukraine originally and when we seen that they actually have the obolon beer it felt just like home! Loved this place and wish we didn't live all the way in SC or this would be our regular!

Oh and at the end they gave us a complimentary desert and thanked us for stopping in!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"What another waste of time!! I really cannot believe this place? Slow, slow, slow!! you will waste your whole lunch time waiting on these imbeciles. The food!? Frozen uncooked garbage! The Gyro took 20 minutes for them to make! 1 sandwich 20 minutes and you give me frozen not even grilled or flamed meat!??!!!???!? Please stay away from the is pathetic place! I will never walk in the door again! They were every rude!! Ok...I gotta go, I can't take it!"}
{"text":"So sad this use to be my favorite Greek place. I've been going there for years! For some reason the quality has changed the rice isn't the same the veggies on the kabobs do not taste good. And I keep asking for they're pink dressing and they say they are going to put it in but they don't. I know I should have checked but I made it a point to say I wanted it. That would be the second time that happened. I tried to give it another shot the other day but it's just not what it use to be :("}
{"text":"Been here multiple times... today will be my last !  I guess new owners took over . The food is disgusting, dry and looks and tastes like yesterday's food, they use the cheapest of the cheapest salad that looks like something I wouldn't even feed my rabbit!  Bottled water is cheap and disgusting!! Then I just witnessed someone wash their hands in the soda dispensary GROSSSSS!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Best Fatoosh salad. Had the vegetarian platter. Everything was fresh and selectable. Server was very attentive and helpful. Will be back. A must try!"}
{"text":"My first time in here. Overall the food was great but It just took especially long to receive it. The manager said that their ticket printer for the cooks messed up, maybe ran out of paper so I sat there and waited for 20 min.

 I asked about the long wait and at that point the manager had just then told me about the mix-up so he offered to comp my meal which I thought was a good way to handle the situation. He was very apologetic and sincere in the way he handled this. That's about all one can ask for when something like that happens. 

I got a beef tenderloin wrap and their chicken wings and rice. The meat in the wrap is tender and cooked right with good flavor. The chicken wings I liked they had flavor all the way through from whatever they marinate them in. Both dishes I got I would order again. I also tried the hummus and pita bread which was really good as well. Great meal overall I was very pleased. Without the comp it would have cost about $23 for this meal. I feel it's a little pricy but it is good quality food though so I will return and give them more business."}
{"text":"So I really wanted a Greek salad, and I stopped here b/c the place down the street was closed for repairs. Dang it, my luck. Im glad I read the menu prior to ordering because it states that all the salads have CARROTS, onions etc....carrots? In a Greek salad? I questioned the guy behind the counter, he confirmed it, I asked if the salads were from a pre mix bag, because that's what I'm thinking now, he said no they make them, then the dressing is a creamy house dressing? Huh? He saw the disappointment on my face. How can you call it a Greek salad? So I went with the beef tenderloin kabob, it was ok, saffron rice was good, that's how they got bumped from 2 stars to 3.  I asked for the optional tomato and onion, but the onions weren't grilled, just sliced with some cilantro, bummer. I should have went to Pin Kaow."}
{"text":"I am not sure why, but the main thing sticking out in my head from my recent visit to the Kabob Grill is the window tint.  I do not believe it was there last time I patronized the restuarant a few years ago.  They may have had wooden blinds.  Either way, from the exterior, you can get no idea of what is to happen on the inside.
No idea whatsoever that it houses some of the best Middle Eastern food in Charlotte.
I went with the grilled lamb kabobs with sides of basmati rice and hummus and I was more than satisfied with my selection.  The lamb was done just right and the portions were ample enough to satisfy my hunger.  
Maybe its the window tint, but the service is never exactly sunny in there.  Nevertheless, you get the Middle Eastern family feel to the establishment and it makes for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. Honestly, I'm in love with the chicken kabobs. I think my emotional affair with the tzatziki sauce should be illegal. 

They started off small and with a pretty diverse menu and to see this Resteraunt grow has been amazing! The food is always fresh and comes out quickly. The family that owns it is amazing and so friendly. Not to mention they keep the dining area clean as can be. I love Persian food, Mediterranean food of all kinds, but this place is top knotch. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because the dining area is smaller than i would like. A little crowded. But that's a good thing too, that means that butts are always in the seats. Way to go kabob grill."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have only been inside a couple of times, but it's easily one of my favorite places. We used to get delivery from here a lot, but they stopped delivery so we were forced to stop by! :) I'm not complaining considering the service is very good. 

I always get the falafel wrap and my husband and I share the sampler platter. The hummus is absolutely amazing! Very creamy and the olive oil they use has a nice, light flavor. The Israeli salad is my favorite, I pretty much put it on everything. Their falafel is also one of the best I've had and it never disappoints! Being almost 8 months pregnant, I pretty much crave it constantly so I can't wait to grab some soon for my birthday."}
{"text":"Maybe it was what I got. (Large Shrimp Platter) However, what I got was not worth what I paid. Unfortunately, I found the entire platter very bland. The pictures look tastier than what I ate."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The falafel salad is amazing, plus the portions are huge! They have daily lunch specials which usually range from $7-$9. They also do takeout. The hummus is another good pick and is homemade. It's very creamy and served with pita and veggies. Yummy!"}
{"text":"So, Cafe Zupas was closed because the kitchen had a fire. \"Wtf\" was my initial reaction. My second reaction was \"now what do we eat?\" My stomach was growling and I could feel the grump emerging from within. I didn't want to travel far, so across the parking lot we ventured to Kabob Grill. 

Arrived around 830 pm, they close at 9 and it was busy. 3 families already eating when we got there and 3 more arrived during our meal. For a small place, it was pretty crowded. I saw a free appetizer with yelp check in (obviously with a purchase of an entree). My friend and I decided since we were getting a free appetizer, we might as well share the entree. We opted for the hummus and the chicken kabob plate. The hummus was smooth, rich and tasty. I added their flavorful olive oil to it, which made it even more amazing. The pita bread that it was served with was warm, thick and soft. I could have made that a meal in itself, but alas I ran out of pita bread :( The chicken kabob plate arrived and I'm glad we decided to split it. The meat was tender. The rice cooked perfectly. And it came with tomatoes and onions!!!! I was freaking ecstatic over the onions. I'm glad we picked this place. 

Like I said, it's a little place and the tables are cramped together. It must get crazy busy during lunch times. Will def be back to try their stuffed grape leaves and gyros."}
{"text":"Enjoy eating at this restaurant. We primarily do take out but the food is always great. Staff is also very friendly and helpful with suggestions from the menu. We usually do Chicken and Steak Kabobs with Basmati Rice and Baba Ghanoush! Always tasty! They also now have a phone app to help make take out orders easier."}
{"text":"Is it so hard to get a little damn service here?? Called the phone at different times but i always get \"user busy\" um nobody is busy answer the damn phone."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but their service sucks. They have not once made my order correctly, literally NOT ONCE. It's so annoying when u pay $12 for something they didn't even make right. It's a chicken AVACADO wrap and they somehow always forget 1 of the MAIN ingredients AVACADO!"}
{"text":"Several years ago (maybe 8...), I used to frequent Kabob Grill for lunch. I loved their pita sandwiches and small, but cozy interior.  I changed jobs and hadn't been back in a while.  So, when my book club decided to meet at Kabob Grill for an early dinner on a Tuesday evening I was pretty excited.  

I walked in to an empty restaurant around 5:20 p.m. to find someone mopping the floor and no one to seat me.  After a minute of awkwardly waiting, someone eventually pointed at a table for me.  The room smelled a bit of dirty mop water, but I figured that would go away quickly.  Not off to a great start, but nothing that good food and service can't make up for - I wish that it had.

The menu, as mentioned extensively in other reviews, is very much overpriced.  I ordered a vegetarian combo - hummus, baba ganoush, taboli, falafel, and some potatoes for $18.  With it came some pita in plastic baggies.  The food was tasty, but not exceptional.  I also ordered a glass of red wine - there are three options, all $10/glass.  I don't mind selecting a $10 glass of wine, but I'd like some choices in the single digits.  

The service, also mentioned extensively in other reviews, was indeed short and gruff. While I didn't lack anything, I didn't feel particularly welcome either.   We also had the unpleasant experience of having a number of fruit flies join our conversation over dinner.  

Overall, the consensus at the table was that the food was okay, but this would not be a place we would meet again."}
{"text":"Driving by and hungry not close to my favorite place I thought I would give it a shot.  Walk in the place is clean service is friendly.  Check out the menu I decided on the Grilled Kafta one of my favorites.  

I did not want the extra pita so I asked and paid for a small amount of salad instead + a tip.  After my 20 minute drive home I found out no salad.  Oh well, plenty of other places to eat on this side of town when im here.  The flavor was good but just not like my favorite place.  

Not bad but not great either..."}
{"text":"The food here was wonderful and the service even better. We had chicken kabobs with two sides. It was a $15 plate but you totally got what you paid for. Fresh, high quality food, well prepared. I got the hummus as one of my sides and it was the best I've had in town. Our daughter loved the kid's kabob but our 4 year old didn't. The server took notice and kindly brought him chicken nuggets at no charge. We will definitely go back!  The food and atmosphere is more upscale than the name sounds. Give it a try!  My husband also enjoyed the Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a Middle Eastern friend come visit me(more often than you think!), I always take them here and they highly enjoy it.  The hummus is great as well as the wraps. I would note that you should ask for your pita to be warmed up. They serve it cold which is a big no-no.
    I'm not 100% sure of the times. So, call ahead and see. But, they have a belly dancer that comes on Friday nights as well as another night. Its very entertaining and because I'm a guy...The girl is extremely hot.  She's a six foot tall Ukrainian blonde that could easily be in the next Bond movie.
Back to Kabob...they also have a few tables for two outdoors and make for a good light dinner outside on these summer nights.  I've been here about 10 times. Its a great place to let your pallet travel a bit."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly cozy and inviting, and the Middle Eastern food is delicious.   It's located in the strip of shops next to the Harris Teeter at Kenilworth Commons so don't miss it when you drive by.  The veggie platter/combo entree is my favorite thing to order- it's huge and it comes with about 8 different items and pita bread.  My boyfriend really likes the pita wraps and the potato harra.  The only negative I have about this place is that it isn't cheap- entrees are mainly $10 or more and the sandwiches are $6, but they don't come with a side.  If you are willing to spend a little bit of money this place is a refreshing change of pace.  Oh, and they have a belly dancer on Friday night."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so good! Everything is packed with so much flavor. Their kabobs are Persian style. The rice, salad and their vinegarette dressing, try it all. Menu is very basic but there's enough options for everyone."}
{"text":"I had the BEST burger here!!  I was skeptical when my sister said let's go to Kabob Grill, but honestly that burger was the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a lamb and beef burger with feta, cucumber and tomato, some tzatziki.  I didn't even get to have it cooked to my normal medium for a burger, but it was so juicy and the flavor combo was so perfect, it did not matter one bit!  It came with fries and a soda and the fries were decent, but honestly the burger was the stand out.  I also had a vegetable soup but it was a little spicy for my wimpy self.  If you find yourself at the Kabob Grill and they have the burger on the menu, do not hesitate, get it!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were on the search for Mediterranean food.  After having to call an audible upon finding out that one place was a 30 minute wait with only \"pseudo\" Mediterranean food, we decided to give Kabob Grill over in Stonecrest a try.  

I decided on the grilled lamb kabob with hummus and baba ghannouj, while my wife went with the vegetarian combo.  We also each got an order of pistachio baklava.  I was very satisfied with my meal.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and did not have that gamey flavor.  The hummus was excellent, and the baba ghannouj had an appealing blend of flavors that made me want more.  And while my wife enjoyed her meal overall, she did note that the yalanji and potatoes harra on her plate were a little heavy on the lemon juice side.  

Service was pleasant, if not a bit slow (the wait staff seemed understaffed that evening).  Pricewise, it was a bit on the high side.  Our meal (which included a beer and a glass of wine in addition to our entrees and dessert) came to $70 (tip included)."}
{"text":"It's nice to have vegan options that are filling and delicious.  The place has a family vibe and the folks here are full of good energy.  I will be sure to stop in any time I fly in to town."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Tabbouleh, Vegetable Soup, Beef Kabob Wrap and Five Desserts!  Breaking my diet on a Monday is a great way to start the week!  Great for me to write some reviews!  Last night dinner at Kabob Grill was very good.  I think he said he and his brother own this one and the one on East Blvd.  This was my first dine at this location!  This was the first time 

I've ever noticed Mint in Tabbouleh - WOW!!!  The Mint really made a difference!!!  Fantastic!  First I had a very good Vegetable Soup: Sweet Corn, Zucchini, Carrots, Onions, Potatoes and Mushrooms!  I have never put crackers in my soup.  Last night I did.  They were more liked naturally dehydrated pita bread pieces.  The Beef Kabob was very good: Beef, Onion, Pickle and Garlic Sauce instead of Hommos (hummus? Right?)

Then dessert:  Chocolate Tartufo: Zabaione Cream center, surrounded by Chocolate Gelato, caramelized hazel nuts and topped with Coco powder. Pistachio Baklava Mmmmm!  Bombe: Sorbet - Mango and Passion Fruit with a Raspberry center, covered in a White Chocolate Shell!  Chocolate Fondant: Chocolate Layer Cake filled with Chocolate Cream, topped with thick Chocolate miroir and the end was surrounded by Chocolate flakes (this one sounds wonderful and was good, though was the least unique and least wonderful, yet was the richest by far!). The Fifth Dessert was Torta Nocciola: layers of Hazelnut Cake, Hazelnut Cream and Chocolate Cream, topped with Hazelnuts.   
 
I would and probably will repeat any part or entire meal again!!!  Service was Fantastic!  The owner was waiting on everyone and did a great job!

Get the Turkish Coffee!!!"}
{"text":"I've had Baba Ghannouj before, though it was never as good as last night!!!  This Kabob Grill and the one at Stonecrest have the best Tabbouleh I've ever eaten!  

Met a friend here for dinner last night.  We had:  Lentil soup, Vegetable soup, Tabbouleh, Chicken Kabobs, Lamb Kabobs, Omars Salad (my first time with this salad - It had corn in it), Baba Ghannouj, Pita Chips, Pita Bread, Potato Harra (I've had this before at this place and do not remember how awesome it is - It's like cubed Hash Browns with Garlic and Lemon Juice).  For dessert we had Baklava (Lebanese version, my preference over the Greek) and a Passion Fruit, Raspberry and Mango covered in a White Chocolate shell Bombe.  

Everything was incredible and I will get all of this again and taste some of the other dishes from all areas of the menu!!!  This is a cozy, relaxed atmosphere, with a warm Charm. The service was fantastic - Through and friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was good to start then I found a huge hair in my food in the middle of my dinner very disgusting and no response from Kabob Grill. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"We used to love this place. The food was great and so was the service. Then they changed owners. I don't remember exactly when, but probably 12-18 months ago, and it went downhill fast, but mostly due to their service. The food was still good. But now apparently even the food has gone way downhill. 

My wife and I just went there after not having been there for quite a few months and we were very disappointed. The kabobs that we loved so much were now very bland. As far as we could tell, they were completely unseasoned. 

Also when I asked for a soft drink, the woman (who I believe to be an owner) didn't bother mentioning that every flavor except for a couple were out of order. Of course things happen and things breakdown. But you should at least warn your clients that you have very limited drink options when they order a drink.

The tzatziki sauce was also bland and not what it used to be. Neither of us liked the new salad dressing either.

While we were there another customer had to ask them to cook the chicken more thoroughly.

We won't be returning.

I recommend Crazy Pita. Food and service is much better there and actually cheaper"}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan of this place. The interior is outdated and gave me the feeling that the place should be steam cleaned. The tables weren't very comfortable either. 

The menu had a good number of options, especially if you are a big lamb-eater (which I am not). 

Desserts were pretty good and maybe worth visiting for, however the main course was worth passing."}
{"text":"Love this place and love that it is within walking distance. VERY clean open kitchen which is a huge bonus! Love the chicken plates and without a doubt the BEST falafel in Las Vegas. Baclava (spelling) is pretty good too. A wonderful welcome to the neighborhood hope they stick around a while. From the looks of it I think they will, they are always busy!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for a quick, low-key, and excellent meal. The vegetarian plate and chicken sauté are my favorites. Service has always been good. Outdoor seating is a huge plus."}
{"text":"My biggest complaint with Charlotte is that there aren't any REALLY good Lebanese or Turkish restaurants.  I do, however, think that Kabob Grill does it's best and their menu is very complete.  The biggest litmus test is the hummus.  Kabob Grill's hummus is not garlic-y enough for me.  That's not to say that they aren't good... Kabob Grill satisfies my cravings but doesn't WOW me.  They offer great lunch specials --  I like the vegetable plate (can't remember what they call it) where you can pick 4 items from a variety of sides.  Their falafels are great!  And, their rice pilaf is perfect!  They also serve sheesha outside, which I love.  The service is always friendly and the restaurant clean.  Parking can be a pain when the Harris Teeter is really busy.  But, all in all, I would recommend this place, for sure."}
{"text":"Halloumi halloumi halloumi!  I go here whenever I am craving halloumi - one of the few places in Charlotte to find it.  It is a great quick lunch spot, but not a place I would go for dinner.  A tiny bit pricy and service is basic, but I can deal with that for halloumi."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef kabab plate. It was a mixture of oil and salt. The quality of the bread rice and masto khiar was good. Below mediocre. I wouldn't recommend at all."}
{"text":"This was a weeks ago but I realize I won't be going back so here it is to the best of my recollection. 

-the humus was tasteless 2 stars
-the $16 Kafta Kabob looked great but wasn't any good plus overcooked and dry to boot -one of the worst Kaftas or Donner I ever had in fact: One star!
-the Baba Ganouj was very tasty and the falafel excellent: Four stars 

but I think the menu said $10 for the falafel wrap?? Overall I found the pricing too high for what it is  and I'm deducting one star. 

I'll take the gritty but authentic La Shish Kabob over this overpriced desperate housewives of Ballantyne location anytime."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh tasting.  Very high quality cooking.  Loved the lunch here."}
{"text":"Hands down worst Greek food I've ever had. For the beef shawarma wrap and upgraded to a side of dolmas. Paid waaaaaaaaay too much for a very small portion of unsatisfactory food. The wrap was room temperature and the dolmas were hot to the touch... What?! Your meat is cold but your stuffed grape leaves are hot? And the woman at the counter was pretty rude. Maybe get your s*** together? I would never recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service followed by good food! We had beef kabob and gyro wrap, and they were very good.  Only thing I found odd was the appetizer was served last and without pita."}
{"text":"I go to school nearby and someone had told me about this place.  I went in and the gentlemen at the front was so nice.  He explained the menu without me having to ask.  I ordered the grilled chicken and the hummus(of course) to go.  I was surprised when I got home how much food I got and how good it was.  The chicken was cooked just perfect.  The hummus tasted really fresh and I got plenty of peta bread.  Other places never give me enough with the hummus.  I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Very friendly counter staff. We ordered the chicken and steak kabob platter, mine with french fries, hubby's with rice. The five meat chunks on each skewer were bitesize and while the chicken was tender and tasty, the steak was somewhat tough. My seasoned fries were really good, and I stole some of hubby's rice....it was perfect--fluffy and tasty! However, the salad was only ok with a sorta Thousand Island-y dressing. And unfortunately, I didn't like my cucumber yogurt or hubby's babaganoush at all so that and the less-than-stellar meat kinda ruined it for me. Not to mention the prices, which were way too high. I've had more for less elsewhere. So, it's back to \"elsewhere!\""}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was very happy with my food! I had the chicken kabobs with a side of hummus and falafel. All great! The service on the other hand was very minimalistic. The waitresses did their jobs but there were no smiles and they stood away from the table speaking very quietly. A bit awkward really. Other than that, the food was great and when it comes down to it, as long as the food is good and the service isn't terribly rude and un equipped then I will most likely return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots near my office. The food is always fresh and delicious. I love the chicken and ground beef kabobs!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The owner was extremely kind & not to mention the food was fresh, hot & full of flavor. 

I came there for lunch with my sister & co worker. I'm very familiar with Mediterranean food but my co worker was not so the owner explained the food & gave suggestions based on what she liked. 

My co worker had her infant son and he cooed & played with him, asked us questions so the baby could eat too ... suggested lentil soup which was puréed & the baby loved it. When he brought out the soup he made sure to put an ice cube without us even asking. Genuinely a nice man! The ambiance was relaxed & beautifully renovated I'd recommend this place to anyone that loves good, fresh Mediterranean food. 

I had chicken kabob w/ sides: Omar salad & cucumber yogurt! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from makeafoodiecall.com, and the food we got was excellent. We ordered a vegetarian assortment and a kabob assortment pair of entrées, with rice as the side. It was a delicious assortment, and truly more food than we could eat, just the two of us. Based on the food, we would have them again, either delivery or eat-in."}
{"text":"I moved to southern highlands and was trying to find a good Mediterranean place to eat at , read a few Yelp reviews about this place figured I'll try it out They are very friendly , gave my children a plate of fries complimentary while we waited for food.  Meat was okay but not much flavor , steak was little ruff for me, the Chicken was nice and tender."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery...   The food was flavorful, fresh and hot.   I will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Excellent! Ordered small chicken kabob plate; included one kabob and two sides. I ordered it with rice and salad and loved everything. I also ordered a grilled tomato which complemented my meal. Husband had the large kabob plate which included two kabobs and three sides. He got chicken and steak and said it was very good. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Hidden at the back of Stonecrest in a shop that faces Regal Cinemas is the Kabob Grill. Talk about quality Mediterranean! On Tuesday Casey and I dined there due to my intense tahini and falafel cravings. As usual, I left fat and happy.

The restaurant itself is classy; the decorations are tasteful and not overdone. Every time I visit I see at least one family, and a few couples. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. The dining area is smaller than in most restaurants, but comfort is not compromised; there is never din and it usually seems fairly quiet to me. 

Among the things I've ordered that stand out;  the grilled kafta kabobs (delicious ground beef with spices), the grilled lamb kabob, and most recently, the lamb kabob pita (packed with hommos, lamb chunks, pickled vegetables mmm!) . Delicious side items to try are; baba ghannouj, falafel, and potato harra. 

I've never ordered it, but this restaurant also offers hookah on the patio to those 18 and older. 

The guys that work here are so nice, and always very attentive. This is a must-try location while in the Ballantyne/South Charlotte area!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly people, the grape leafs were smaller than I am used to but still good."}
{"text":"Today I ordered kabob grill & was not satisfied with my order. I asked for 3 separate shirazi salads & received a sauce tub with salad in it. Not very happy about it, especially for the total to come out to $48 including our main orders. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great service

The food here was awesome, the price was right, and the staff is I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E.

I got the Chicken Breast Soltani plate with rice and a green salad. The meat was juicy and flavorful while not being overly seasoned. The rice was buttery and well cooked while the salad was crisp and fresh.

The hummus was awesome, but the best part of the meal was the pita bread. They bake it in house and it was hot when we got it. There are few things better than fresh bread. There are even fewer things better than fresh pita."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated.  $50+ for three meals plus a side of hummus is a bit pricey but will be coming back because it was that good and friendly service."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak Kabob with rice, French fries and falafels. This was my first time trying the falafels and I must say I am hooked. We also got the steak wrap which of course was delicious, and a side of rice. The music wasn't too loud and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Simple menu, fresh preparation, reasonable prices, great food. That's about all you need to know when deciding if you are going to go here. 

The menu has a wide variety of middle eastern style salads and sides. The menu is priced so that you can try something new. 

This place is not fancy, but very clean. It is a casual atmosphere like you'd find in any family-owned eatery- only this one serves kabobs, hummus, tabbouleh, and more. 

Finish the meal with one of the several varieties of baklava available. We like the pistachio variety."}
{"text":"Well it's friday before labor day and we tried out The Kabob Grill for the first time. I was worried we wouldn't be able to get a table, but to our surprise we were the only ones in the place at 6:30 on a friday night! We placed our order and as we waited for our dinner, there was plenty of phone orders and people coming in for take out (some taking out 4 to 5 bags full of food!). The place is nice and clean, with nice mellow music playing in the background. There is one TV with a college football game on, so if you need to watch something important, they can probably change the channel for you. I was glad to get a seat in there and I keep comparing the place to another Greek place that we always go to and that place is near impossible to get a table unless you are lucky, but enough of that because this is some place else. The good thing is the food is really good and fresh! I had the chicken kabob dinner and Lana had the beef, since each comes with two each, we got to trade so we could try a taste of both. Greek salad was good, french fries were perfectly cooked and the rice pilaf was very nice and light. Pita bread is excellent and in small half circles that I have never seen before. Hummus and Babaganosh was just like Mama used to make (ha ha!). Dine in food is served on attractive red plates and presentation was a step up from the norm which is refreshing for a simple place. Do a \"check-in\" and they will comp you your soft drinks. The price per person is about $10 each and the portions of meat a just a tiny bit smaller than we are used to, but if you are not a huge appetite person the entrees are just right. The sides and pita bread rounds out the meal very nicely so there is plenty to keep you satisfied. Hmmm? this was our first time and we hardly ever have dessert, but I don't remember seeing that offered on the menu, but I could have overlooked it.
One word of caution though, if you order fries there is a area where you get your utensils, salt and pepper and such; well the red plastic squeeze bottles are not ketchup, it's tabasco sauce! No big deal though, I didn't put that much on my french fries before I figured out the watery ketchup is hot sauce. South Eastern Ave sure has alot of restaurants and it seems this area close to Big-5 sporting goods is one of our favorite spots. Good Indian food, Great Crepes and now Greek!"}
{"text":"Went here with my best friend on a Sunday evening, and the food was good; could have been a little warmer. Definitely good though! I had the falafel pita and it was tasty. The only odd thing that we were concerned about was we were the only ones in the restaurant for the entire duration of the meal which made it awkward and felt strange."}
{"text":"This place was great. Food was fresh, good portions and very flavorful. Small restaurant but clean and friendly. The only thing I'll say is for takeout $90 is quite price for 4 people with one only ordering a salad. Definitely great for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"I was surprised when this showed up in my search results. It was 11 miles from my hotel and I did a search on seafood. However, after reading the reviews and realizing my work that brought me to NC did not start till tomorrow afternoon I figured, why not. 

This was a nice find. It has all the basic items you would expect to find at a Mediterranean place. I started with the rice soup which was nice and light. I then moved on to the Kefta and teamed it up with humus and basmati rice. All of it was great. Fluffy rice, flavorful kefta and smooth humus. 

The owner thought I was the sister of a regular. This scored me a polite conversation and some free baklava. Even after I broke the news that he had me confused with someone else.

I am an explorer so I might not venture here again if I am back in the area, but, if I lived here, this would be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Am new to the area and decided to check the local cuisine.  Greek food sounded good so I decided to give these guys a try.  Got the small beef kabob place.  Basically the meal and my soda was $14 I got a bunch of rice a small salad and 4 prices of meat.  Definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"I went there this weekend and ordered a chicken sharma. It was well seasoned but it had way too much sauce on it. It still tasted better then a lot of other ones that I have tried in Charlotte. A little over prices (should be around $6 but its around $9) which is over priced."}
{"text":"Eat here while you can.

Signs are pointing to imminent closure -- which is unfortunate. I'd love to give a 5-star review, but with some of the changes going on, I just can't. 

1- Closed on Sundays now. 
2- Sauces with entrees are no longer free. What used to be included with a plate meal, is now $0.25.
3- Portion sizes have been reduced. The kabobs are smaller, the protein portions are smaller, even the TWO DOLLAR soft drink has been reduced. It was probably 24 oz before. It's half. 

The food is great. It's fresh and the flavor is a bit on the mild side for my liking, but it really is a smart decision after going to the gym. However, with these changes I'm afraid quality is the next thing to be sacrificed. 

First rule of business -- when you need to save money, don't do it in a way that affects your customers. Cut your operating expenses elsewhere. Closing on Sunday was probably a smart move if it's not a profitable day. But charging for a small cup of a sauce and reducing fountain drink cups is irritating -- especially since you're not doing anything to increase the value of my meal elsewhere. But cutting down the portion sizes is where I have to draw the line. This decision is directly impacting the value of what I'm getting for my money. The cuts that have been made here have caused me to stop coming entirely. I'm writing this review waiting for my last meal to be served.

I'm sorry it has to end like this. But we just have to part ways. So really, your cost saving measures are backfiring on you. You're losing customers. 

So let's take a look around and see what we can come up with?

Napkins -- I just watched a guy take an entire fistful. He doesn't need all of those and there's a lot of waste there. Pull a subway and give 2 when you bring the food -- more if I ask. 

Lemons and peppers by the water -- How much of that are you throwing out every day because they go unused? You seriously don't need that many lemons. 

Plates -- They look great, but how much does it cost you to wash these? You could probably find disposable plates that look elegant enough to be under your food at a lower cost. 

POS -- Fancy credit card terminal you've got there. Do you know how much you're paying for processing though? Might want to shop around. You can always find a better deal. 

TV -- Cut the cable. It's always on mute anyway. I barely notice it. Get an appletv box and stream entertainment if it is that important to your staff and customers.

ADVERTISE -- For the love of everything, you need to advertise more. Take samples and coupons to the local gyms. You're sandwiched between 2 EoS Fitness gyms and the guys and gals that lift there would love to know about you and your food. 

Loyalty Programs -- Find a way to reward your customers and entice new ones. RewardsNetwork and Epoxy are two of my favorites. RewardsNetwork pays me in airline miles for dining with participating restaurants. It's the first place I check when I'm hungry and want something new. Epoxy is a mobile app where you can provide customized loyalty cards and rewards. 

Hope this helps you return to the glory you once had. Good luck to you. If you're still around in a few months, I might check back in."}
{"text":"So things have definitely changed here . 
I use to love coming here for a quick meal, but the last 3 times I came I definitely noticed the changes immediately. 
1. No longer open on Sunday 
2. Charges for sauce 
3. Every Time theres a new sign mentioning what they don't take or offer anymore 
4. Food is not as tasty 
- spicy chicken is now just being served as I would assume is their normal chicken kabobs .
- they changed the rice & I hate it 
- sauce has become bland 

This will be my last time visiting here unfortunately .

I would recommend going to Kabob Express on eastern it is by far the best kabob place I've had in Vegas so far & their food never disappoints !"}
{"text":"My wife LOVES falafels, so since we happened to be at the HT, we figured we'd grab an order or two to go to snack on later. I called and was told 5-10 minutes. I got there 20 minutes after calling, I was greeted by a smug hostess who told me it would be a few minutes more. It's Sunday noon and they're blasting some sort of club-euro music like kabob grill is hosting brunch in NYC. Forget that though, I then was charged $22 for 2 appetizer orders of falafels. $22 for 12 pieces, and the falafel was mediocre at best. Next time we are at HT and she's craving falafels, I'll just see if they have some in the frozen section."}
{"text":"I've been ordering food from Kabob Grill for over 4 years. You get large portions of rice and your selected plate (steak/ground beef, chicken, vegetarian, etc.).  I'm a recent vegetarian but I would never know that I'm missing anything, because their Veggie Platter is so delicious and flavorful.  You get generous portions of vegetables, peppers, and mushrooms, and I always order roasted tomatoes as well.  I feel like I'm getting a complete, homemade meal, and I always feel full when I'm done eating.   I'm also a fan of their stuffed grapes leaves: so yummy.  The staff are super nice, especially John, who is incredibly helpful and efficient.  The cashier (young woman whose name I don't know) makes ordering over the phone fast and quick and accurate. Fun place to just hang out and eat as well."}
{"text":"Gyro wrap ($8.99) was good and flavorful, but the falafel wrap ($7.99) was flavorless.  Each comes with your choice of tzaziki/hummus with your wrap, and a side.  I chose French fries and babaghanoush.  Both were good.  I like it that they seasoned their fries.  I can eat them without ketchup.  Babaghanoush is good, but beware,  your breath will be garlicky for the rest of the day.  Brushing and rinsing does not help.

Check in via yelp gets you a free drink.  The staff were friendly, and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I love finding little hidden gems while driving around. This little tiny place I found and so glad I tried them!

The service was great, considering my inconsiderate self strolled in 15 minutes before closing! :-/ (rude!) Anyhow-they were polite, food was great and never felt like I needed to inhale my food and go. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Soltani and it was made to perfection! Chicken was flavorful, nicely grilled, rice was fresh, overall just delicious! Good job to the owner and staff!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic ethnic cuisine!  Would like to see more lamb selections available for lunch, but was surprised to have baba ganoush available as a side....very tasty too I might add!  I am a huge fan of mediterranean chow so I have no idea why I have not been here before and I will certainly come back for more.....the only knock would be that the service was a bit on the cold side.  Good food helps overcome these kind of short-comings :)"}
{"text":"Friendly folks and good food. Would be awesome if they had appetizers like cheeseballs :-) Definitely will eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I work at Dilworth Coffee (next door) and my co-workers and I often get lunch here. Their hummus is SO creamy and delicious! It's definitely one of the best I've ever had. As a vegetarian, I am partial to the falafel wrap: it's always crunchy, fresh and flavorful. They're very generous with their portions, and the prices are more than fair. A great place for a quick, authentic Middle-Eastern style lunch.

PS: You've GOT to try \"Omar's Salad\"! So much flavor!!! It has lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, green pepper, sweet corn, parsley, dry mint, lemon juice and olive oil... a-maz-ing!"}
{"text":"Very very tasty and super filling.  I like the Felafel wrap and fries.  I kinda wish the Felafel was shredded a little  cause it all falls out and is messy but it's so good it's worth it."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have never eaten here before! The kids and I were starving for some food and we finally agreed to order a hodge podge from Kabob Grill and take it home. Everything we ordered was delicious. The girls wanted grilled chicken over a salad and they were easily accommodated with a child-sized portion. My husband and I ordered specials - he got a wrap, I got something tomato-ey and layered. I can't wait to go back and try out some more options!"}
{"text":"I was  looking for a healthy spot for lunch and spotted this place so figured I'd give it a try.  Of course before going in I did check the Yelp reviews and that solidified my decision.  I ordered the salmon kabob platter which came with two salmon kabobs,  salad and for my side I chose the rice. Fair price for $12.99.  My drink was free with check in.  This is definitely a place I would eat at again or order take out from if I'm in the area.  There was no wait on the Sunday afternoon that I went and the people working there are beyond friendly.  I wish they would open a location on the Westside."}
{"text":"Meh sums it up. There are better middle eastern places out there, but if you're in the neighborhood, this will do. It's decent, just not much to write home about."}
{"text":"This place is amazing but it's getting ready to close at the end of this month. The landlord sadly decided not to renew their contract. They have an uptown location called Levant, but I haven't been. If it truly has the same menu as Kabob, then it will be worth the trip. You literally cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, though I typically tend to get lamb kabobs with potato harra and baba ganouch. Their hummus is really  good too."}
{"text":"Great portion size. Great flavor. Understood our gluten free issues. Vegetarian platter filled me up - 6'10\" 225 lbs"}
{"text":"Oh man, I'm still drooling over the vegetarian combo I had last night. Probably because there was enough leftovers for lunch today. Everything on my plate was delicious! Service was fantastic, super friendly and efficient. We were in a rush to see a movie and the kitchen was able to whip up both our dishes in record time! 

I'll definitely be back to more thoroughly enjoy the delicious food."}
{"text":"OK food, humus was delicious and the falafels were good we were a group of 10, we ordered several platters. While the service left us perplexed, we definitely will not go back to avoid such lousy service! Unbelievably rude!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch before making the drive home to So Cal.  We wanted our final holiday meal to be a relatively healthy one having eaten heartily all week in beautiful Las Vegas.  I had the chicken kabob combo with the Greek salad & cucumber yogurt.  My friend had the beef kabob combo.  The food was delicious.  It was low salt & low grease and tasted great.  We were glad not to have eaten a heavy meal because we didn't want to feel bloated for the tedious drive home."}
{"text":"Been there twice now and had the falafel dinner both times and both times they were made very well...the flavor is above average when I compare to other falafel I've had.  My wife had lentils the most recent time and she loved them and she is pretty picky about lentils.  The price is abit inflated but the experiences thus far haven't detered me from worrying about that."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving shawarma, and I had heard that this place was good, so we gave it a try. Big mistake. 

We started with the hummus. It was good, but the pita bread came wrapped in plastic baggies and was terribly dry. It ruined the appetizer, IMO.

Husband ordered the chicken pita wrap. Hardly any chicken on it and it came with no sides. I ordered the mixed grill plate. The meats were pretty good, but the kafka was bone dry and my sides were awful. I had the potato harra and it was so overly lemony that it was uneatable. The baba ganosh was also gross. 

The service was good, which is the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars. Otherwise, it would just have gotten 1 star. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I pick up food from here way too much.. and there's a good reason for it. Everything is fresh and so unbelievably tasty. I refuse to go anywhere else for kabobs as it's always a letdown!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Kabob Gril about 7 times - mostly for lunch or an afternoon snack.  It is a small, casual place that serves up some tasty middle eastern dishes.  I have not tried too much on the menu - i go for the gyros (shawerma) or the chicken kabobs.  They are good!  The service isn't the most friendly but the food arrives quickly."}
{"text":"Food is pretty mediocre. Prices are very reasonable, tables are clean, fast and efficient service.

Came here for a quick bite one night after working out and was craving some Mediterranean food. My friends and I each ordered one combo and we shared. The portions were ok, but the food didn't taste that good. It was just very mediocre both in flavor and presentation. 

The tables and floor were very clean, and our food came our really fast after we ordered. I would return if I was really close by but definitely would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice place with good Mediterranean food. However the service is pretty bad. When I went there, there were two waitresses and barely anyone in the restaurant. One of them was nice, but the other one with red hair was rude. She didn't seem to care much about us, and she just threw the menus on the table leaving without asking us if we wanted anything to drink. She came back a few minutes later asking if we wanted anything to drink. We got some hot tea, water, and Turkish Ayran (which is really good!) but she took forever to bring them to our table; the place wasn't even busy. After we got our food never did she once come by our table to refill our water glasses. The food was great, but if the waitress keeps being rude and treating customers disrespectfully the chance I would be visiting this place again would be slim to nonexistent."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Charlotte this is my first and last stop.  Absolutely the best Lebanese food I have found, right down to the garlic paste.  I highly recommend the potato harra side, and I usually get the chicken skewers or shawarma.  I have brought lots of friends here and everyone rates this place very highly.  You really can't go wrong if your looking for a good middle eastern food place."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite food place in Las Vegas, and I cannot recommend it enough. The staff is excellent and consistent, and their customer loyalty card makes it a very frequent stop for me (1 free after 8 purchases, I think). The service is also fast, making it the perfect lunch time stop.

I always order a small chicken main dish, which comes with one chicken Kabob, 2 warm pitas, some mind-blowing rice, and onion and lemon. Their hummus is also excellent. This place is an awesome value for the money. I am sure everything on the menu is great, but I have not branched out because I love the chicken so much!"}
{"text":"I love the Kabob Grill. We went this weekend and all I kept thinking was \"why don't we come here more often?\" 

Service: A+ 
Food: A+ 
Ambiance: A (pretty good for a strip mall)
Price/Quantity of Food: A+
Parking in Stonecrest Shopping Center: F&$#

Oh yeah, that's why we don't come here more!

But - the good news is the food is totally worth driving around in circles and yelling/getting yelled at by people in giant SUVs. It really is that good. They have reasonably priced bottles of wine, their quantities are HUGE (you can easily share the mixed kabob platter - there are 4 skewers of meat + 2 sides). Don't worry, they bring pita bread in case you are really starving! And I have to mention that the food is so delicious! So delicious! I am still mad at myself for forgetting this place."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!! Had the Steak Kabob plate with hummus & baba ghanoush as sides. The Steak was tender & seasoned nicely, the pita bread was warm & delicious, not too doughy."}
{"text":"Kabob Grill. I was entering the Twilight Hunger Zone when I visited. You've been there. You missed lunch, it's still 2 hours until dinner and you are hungry!

Solution= heavy appetizers. Hummus plate and Baba Ganoush. The Hummus was super creamy, heavy on the tahini and was presented nicely with pickled veggies = delicious. The Baba Ganoush was even better - beefy, smoky eggplant goodness = highly addictive and very filling. The pita come wrapped in little baggies to keep them fresh.

Our waiter had oodles of personality and joked around a bit.

Quick disclosure Efes tastes like Budweiser - just be aware when you order it. 

So, I can't speak for any of the dinner plates, but apps only. I did think the prices were on the high side but we were ordering from the dinner menu. Maybe it's cheaper at lunch."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, always fresh, and more than enough. If we are ever in Stonecrest, this is the first place we choose to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food tastes always fresh and is very tasty. The Yogurt Cucumber Dip with the Grape Leaves is delicious."}
{"text":"McKabob is more appropriate for this restaurant - portions are skimpy - food subpar - tabouli salad was parsley and lemon only. Spinach square mostly air and the pita came in a plastic bag. Way overpriced for what you get. On second thought head to McDonalds instead."}
{"text":"everything is made to order so it's well worth the wait! i love the fresh flavor of the chicken gyro and it's awesome that you get to chose a side from 7 different choices. the first time I went with the falafel which was different to me but still enjoyable. this time around I went with the rice and it was on point with some of their choices of the sauces, tzatziki, cilantro or garlic. my personal favorite is the cilantro because of all of the flavor. great check in deal of a free fountain drink to go with your meal. on top of the wonderful food, the service is great too. everyone I've had there so far has been so nice!"}
{"text":"the food was great and the service too. I definitely plan on being back soon. love me some Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a coworker. Place is pretty nice inside; clean and new with a TV in the dining area showing sports. Food is ordered from the counter. We chose the shish kebab and chicken grill lunch specials.

Counter service was friendly, but the food was extremely slow. Despite the restaurant being less than half-full, it took nearly 20 minutes for us to receive our food. Felt weird for a place with counter service. Good thing we had the TV.

Food was also rather expensive relative to portion size. Shish kebab was mostly peppers/onions and then just four thin slices of meat, and the accompanying salad and pita were very small. At least the food itself was well-prepared and tasty.

Ultimately this feels like a place that wants to cut costs by offering limited service and small portions like a budget spot, but wants to price items and have slow service as if it's a nicer sit-down place. In that regard it fails on both counts."}
{"text":"I am so impressed. I found this place on yelp and was craving Greek. For $11.99 as a large plate, I got two chicken skewers with rice, pita and hummus, and falafel balls. It was huge portion too. My friend got the steak with fries and hummus pits and salad. Everything was so fresh and flavorful! The place was clean and rather small but this is amazing food for a fast food type of restaurant. I can't wait to come back and eat here again!!! Friendly workers also, even the kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"This place is situated in a nice shopping center and although it's small, there are plenty of windows to people watch from and a couple of outside tables. The music was a pleasant addition too. The man behind the counter didn't greet me or smile, just stood there waiting for me to order. I ordered a veggie kabob plate with rice and salad for my sides, adding hummus. He said,\" Do you want anything else?\" I inquired about the dressing on the salad. He said it was a mayo based thousand island type or they had vinaigrette. I chose the vinaigrette, glad I asked. I sat down and waited. He brought out my meal in a timely manner and it was very, very good. The veggies had just the right amount of char, I could've eaten 10 of those. The rice was tasty. Hummus yummus! (Sorry, I'm annoying). Salad excellent with that vinaigrette. Pita, warm and soft, and the price was right. Super pleased and I will go back. The service wasn't awful; no one was rude, but it was a lil chilly. Anyone can have a bad day though so I will be sure to update on my next visit."}
{"text":"One of the best places for my cravings of falafel and chicken shawarma! Amazing taste and excellent quality! I love the owner, he's so sweet and remembered that I love extra garlic sauce! I will definitely be going here more often!"}
{"text":"The food is still delicious but unfortunately, we've decided we won't be going back. They've slowly reduced what you get with your entree & increased the amount they charge. Your no getting enough \"bang for your buck\" as they say. They started off strong & the food is very good, but you can't expect to keep long term customers when they know you used to offer so much more....and for less money. No more roasted tomatoes, sliced onions, much smaller cuts of meat on the kabobs & more veggies. I love my veggies, but I'm not paying $10+ for a veggie kabob & some rice."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mediterranean food - portions are nice sized.  Hidden gem."}
{"text":"We love Kabob Grill. Have been going for years to both locations. The food is always tasty and homemade. Great flavors."}
{"text":"I got the ground beef platter , really tasty! The gyro is also good.  The meat is tender, not dry at all."}
{"text":"sorry to say that  it is not what it used to be in my opinion the taste of the kabab is defiantly not the same.
i hope they can improve to what they use to be."}
{"text":"I lived in the Middle East for a little while; this is the real deal. 

My tip is to actually go. It's name and appearance from the outside are deceiving. It's an incredible restaurant with great service and better food. 

Vegetarian platter is amazing. So is the fried cheese ap."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is  perfectly seasoned, the Greek fries are amazing, and the service is always with a smile! Great lunch spot for me...but I'd drive the 20 miles from home to enjoy it as well!! Everything is made with LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"In summary: Overpriced and not very good. A small cup of lentil soup that was very watered down was $4.50 ... the main dish \"tabouleh\" salad was overly doused with vinegar and 90% parsley with some diced tomatoes - no bulgur ... I have never seen such a receipe. I left hungry. Service was a bit slow. We won't be going back there - there are too many nicer restaurants around to waste ones time and money on this place."}
{"text":"We have been to Kabob Grill many times since they opened their new location on Eastern. We always get the Chicken Soltani [Ground Beef & Chicken Kabob] dish which is served over a bed of rice, with raw onions and a grilled tomato and their Hummus [with pita bread]. We once tried the Eggplant Dip [which contains Grilled Eggplants blended with Tomatoes, Eggs and Garlic) and is served HOT; it was good, but their dips are a little overpriced. It is a great place to get authentic middle eastern eats at a \"reasonable\" price with quick service. I will say that while their prices in general are \"fair\", their charge for their \"dips\" [i.e. Hummus] is a little much, but I guess it is a tough economy. The service, in general, has always been above-par."}
{"text":"My friend Becky had  highly recommended this place and so we decided to go there before a girls movie night out.  I usually judge a book by its cover when it comes to restaurants/bars that are located in \"strip malls.\"  From the outside Kabob Grill looks pretty generic but the inside has a great decor and feels very quaint and clean- it did not feel like a strip mall at all.  There is even a cute little bar.  The server, who may have been the owner, was super friendly and helped us with our dinner selections.  I had a great kabob that came with a bunch of sides - yummy baba-ganoush.  It was a ton of food - which I thought was reasonably priced.  Definitely felt like a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, food is pathetic compared to Persian kabobs.  Went for the second time with a friend who wanted to see the Friday night belly dancer but just our luck she wasn't performing that night.  I have a strong feeling that she hasn't performed in some time.

I can't expound enough upon just how overpriced the food is here.  $15 for 3 tiny skewers of chicken kabobs over angel hair pasta-infused basmati?  $8/glass for the house wine? Are you kidding me?

Charlotte is in desperate need of a Persian kabob house. Someone, please!"}
{"text":"Loved everything 
Fresh food and friendly people
What else could you want
Can not wait for the next round"}
{"text":"The food was ok.... 
But not real mediterranean food style.
I try a lot of places before, 
Good but that's it"}
{"text":"Kabob Grill is located in a strip mall in Dilworth, in the same shopping center as Harris Teeter, so the ambiance is.. meh.  BUT the food is great.   Kafta, fattoush, hummus, grape leaves, potatoes, falafel, kabobs.  All of it, awesome.  Kabob is owned by the same people who own LeVante (uptown), and even though the menus are very similar, the food at Kabob is consistently better."}
{"text":"A small clean restaurant that is reasonable in price. The food was good and the servers both very helpful. The kabob was tasty the salad delicious and refreshing . The hummus  and pita (once I asked them to warm it) was perfect for the price ."}
{"text":"Wow amazing service amazing food!! Excellent 
Flavor and taste you will love it!! This is a must try place!! 
Thank you for your service and food! Your friend from Romania."}
{"text":"The best food, service, quality & value! Try the \"Wing Kabobs\" I here they are amazing...."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 3 stars because they really do have good food.  But...of course a but...a chicken kabob meal (chix plus two sides) is $17.  Then, the BEST part of that place is the garlic sauce and it $3.50 for a side..side..of garlic sauce (3 oz?).  Then add one glass of wine and you are out the door at $37.  I had the cucumber/yogurt as a side wnd there were no cucumbers in it so yeah, no.  Go with something else as a side.  I certainly want this place to stay around but go another 3 miles to Viva Chicken for $15."}
{"text":"For Persian food it was pretty good.  Persian food is one of my favorites.  However the portion size of the kebabs was small.  Great rice, great mustomusir.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We were here for the first time about 2 years ago with some friends and the food was excellent . Tonight that was not the case. Potato Harra was really good. Salad was almost all cilantro. Mixed kabobs were extremely dry I couldn't tell the difference between the steak and lamb but the chicken was really good. I think it's a new cook and food was hit or miss."}
{"text":"Hmmm. So what do I think about Kabob Grill?
- Standard Mediterranean restaurant.
- A bit steep.
- I got the chicken kabob with fattoush and stuffed grape leave. It was average.
- I asked if they have Turkish / Greek coffee and how much it cost? They sure do and the small cup cost $7.00. Say (In high pitch) Whaaaat?!!
- Friendly and fast service.

Three and Three quarter Yelps."}
{"text":"The food is good but somewhat expensive-- the vegetarian  platter is $18!  The remodel added more tables but took out the bar.  The new place seems more like a diner than a restaurant.  Everything I've had here is good.  I will say the pitas they serve are a little dry and stale but other than that, it's all good."}
{"text":"I went with a friend, her food was great. It came in ten minutes, and it was good, as I nibbled on her food. I waited for my meal which I felt was unusual that it didn't arrive with my friends food because we had ordered at nearly the same time.  45 minutes, I saw three people who had ordered after me receive their orders. Turns out they forgot about my order. They gave me a refund but didn't even apologize or offer explanation. That's about an hour of my life I won't get back. That's okay, ik a customer they won't get back. They could of easily saved me as a customer."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 3 years and have always had a great meal.  They have authentic food in a casual setting.  The veggie platter is the best, especially the potato harra, hummus, and spinach pie."}
{"text":"Our family came to visit from the Middle East and we were looking forward to having a wonderful meal and wonderful service.

Unfortunately, the red head Russian waitress provided very poor customer service...service without a smile....just saying...even McDonald's always provided service with a smile.

To be honest, the Hummus and the Coke were the best things on the table.

The Pita bread was horrible...like it was purchased from Harris Teeter.

Our guests and our kids left hungry...and our kids had 3 plates from the kids meal...

Never going back and will let our family and friends think twice about this place...seriously..."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Always delicious and made with the freshest ingredients.    Owner and staff very friendly.  One of our favorite restaurants for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Family style atmosphere. Food was delicious. Owner talked to us and made suggestions based on our palate. He actually took the time to listen. Coolest thing I saw was when the couple at the other table had finished and were getting ready to discard half their food, he kind of took offense as he stated \"I hate to waste food\" and  turned their remaining food into sandwiches and sides to take home at no additional charge. I thought that was very cool. This place is what small businesses should be all about. Great food. Will definitely return. Even gave us tips on where to get excellent Mediterranean groceries!"}
{"text":"Small but clean restaurant, the staff is super friendly and gave us a rewards card. Buy 8 meals and get the 9th for free! Food was good, and the lamb chops were super soft. There was no line at all and it was lunch time (12pm)."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday.  My wife got the Steak Sandwich, I got the Gyro Plate and we got a side kabob for my two year old.  We all loved our food.  My son is  super picky and he finished all his food with no problem.  

Service was quick and the food was excellent.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Baba ganush was sweet- oddly. Kabobs mixed plate was good! Kind of over priced for the portion size."}
{"text":"Great balkan style lunch menu!
Excellent Hummus, fresh salad and vegetables and the chicken skewers were also very well seasoned.. But a little bit dry.
Service was very friendly! :-)"}
{"text":"Since my friend was having a serious middle eastern garlic sauce craving we went in search of a middle eastern restaurant and wound up at the Kabob Grill.

It's a small place with maybe 5 small tables inside, 2 tiny ones out front and and high-top bar stool area.

We started with the hummus, yum-o!  It was a large serving that can out with a few veggies, an olive oil moat (two thumbs up for the presentation).  It was served with pita that was prepackaged in sets of 3 triangles wrapped in individual plastic bags, a bit unnecessary but if the purpose is to seal in the flavor than it was a success. 

I ordered the falafel aka veggie wrap and my friend got the chicken sawerman wrap, with an extra side of garlic sauce of course, and a side of fattoush salad.  I devoured my wrap, it was great! The falafel with perfect and with all the marinated veggies (beets, radish, lettuce, tomato, and pickles) made it super flavorful.  

Needless to say we got our fix and left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Wow I am so sad this place has new owners! We brought our food home today and upon opening the container we noticed the food has changed. The new owners are not doing things the same and I will not patronize this place anymore. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am to have lost my favorite kabob place in town.

My steak was dry, the saffron rice recipe has changed and tastes nothing like it use to. Different salad dressing, which was the only change that I sort of enjoyed as it was refreshing and light but I still would have liked the old Iranian style yogurt/ketchup recipe they would give me. They forgot my hummus, which would have never happened with the old owners. Now they are skimping by not putting bell peppers and onions in between each piece of chicken, really? Peppers and onions are so cheap! The pita bread was not as soft either and hard on the edges like it sat out too long. The chicken flavor and the fries seemed to be the only thing that remained the same.

This place will not last since all the regulars that come here expect the SAME EXACT FOOD they have been eating forever. I personally have been there dozens of times and I have always received the best service and food and they were always so consistent. I am shedding a foodie tear tonight and if the old owners are reading this please let me know where your next restaurant will be!"}
{"text":"I think these places figured a way to manipulate these ratings because this place is awful we ordered 2 gyros with fries the gyro meat wasn't cooked right and the fries smelled like old frying oil 2 other people were sitting next to us and they left before we got the food and out of the whole plate they ate only the meat so the salad on one and rice was there full they didn't eat it = awful food


Update I got sick from their undercooked gyro meat"}
{"text":"We should have picked up on the signs when we entered an empty restaurant at dinner time on the weekend. Only three guys were sitting outside drinking. One of them turned out to be the owner/manager. After the owner and the hostess finished arguing whether the place was closed or open, we were asked to take seats.

We reluctantly sat down. We asked our server if the bar was open. She said yes, upon which I ordered a bacardi with lemonade. There was a lot of shuffling behind the bar with our waitress seeming lost what to do. Eventually they called the owner to help them out. By this time we were already feeling like uninvited guests. The inebriated owner decided to make two of my drinks - one for me and the other for himself. It really was a simple drink but tasted weird. Meanwhile our orders were taken. Some more shuffling another time the owner was summoned. This time it seemed to be some problem with the kitchen cooks. 

After some rude exchange between the staff the owner went back out. By this time we had kinda lost our appetite and were wondering what the hell was going on. I had ordered a chicken Shwarma wrap with fries. I asked the hostess if there was a problem and she responded that they didn't have fries. 

We told her it was just not working out and we wanted to just pay for the drink and leave. Not the typical dinner we had envisioned before a movie. Of course the owner was called again. The drunk man rudely asked if we had placed the order or not. I said we were just told you are out of fries. His response was amazing, \" we can get some fries from Wendy's for you\". No sir, I had not come to a Mediterranean place to eat fries from wendys. He lost his temper and said you can leave, leaving us glad that this episode was about to end.

We offered to pay for the drink which I had barely touched. It was too late. He was already shouting never come back again. I was surprised he even considered that we will return again. But the real kicker that spoiled our evening completely was when he said , \"good, I do not like Indians anyways\". After 6 years in the USA, this was the first time I had faced discrimination. Funnily enough it seemed like it came from an immigrant himself.

I don't care how the food might be from this place. I discourage anyone and everyone who is against discrimination to disregard this place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place and finally did. Interesting dishes that certainly aren't common in NC. 

I would have liked it better were it not for the fact that the food was swimming in olive oil. Perhaps this is common for Middle Eastern food. I don't know. I tried my best to avoid the puddles of oil and \"dig\" around it, but it is just way too much oil for my taste. If you have gallbladder disease, this would send you to the ER. 

It really was not very spicy either. I certainly prefer Indian food's spiciness. The falafel (chickpeas, fava beans, cilantro, spices) had potential but needed to be much hotter. 

And last the grilled chicken kabob was just . . . chicken. Nothing special about it. 

The garlic potatoes were good (but my wife's are better). The spinach pie was quite good. The baklava desert was delicious. 

The staff were friendly and helpful.

Would have actually given it 2 stars were it not for the fact that maybe all Middle Eastern food is swimming in olive oil, and maybe I'm not the best judge of this cuisine."}
{"text":"Serving persian food in fast food setting. Very clean and well done food. I had chicken kabob plate and cucumber and yogurt. Liked the quality of food and the atmosphere. The lady un the counter was noce and helpful. The food was reasonably priced. Liked the freshly baked bread as well. I recommend if you are passing through the area of working close by. Not suitable for parties of dates ! Lol"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, and the food is good, they serve bigger than standard sizes. And they gyro was prwtty bomv"}
{"text":"I've gone to Kabob Grill a handful of times, and each time I go, I leave full and with a smile on my face! The food is always fresh, and delicious! I always either get the chicken or steak kabob plate! The staff is always super kind, and they always check with you to see how the food is!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Kabob Grill. Their chicken is fresh and juicy. I was a little intimated by the amount of rice they give with their kabob plates, but the rice is SO good, you won't be able to stop eating it. 

They are also super fast. I called, placed my order and they said my food would be ready in 15 minutes. I came 5 minutes earlier and my food was handed to me immediately. 

My plate came with a side, so I asked for hummus. I don't know if it was a goof up, but the hummus did not come with pita.  Make sure you ask for pita with the hummus. 

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for fast, healthy Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Had a $10 of coupon,  so we gave the place a try.   Huge Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food fans. 

Decent food,  but nothing special.   Good humus,  falefel.   Grape leaves tasted like exactly what we used to buy from Costco.  Portions were small to average,  prices typical. 

Requested the bill,  and noticed it looked like the coupon was not deducted.   Asked the server,  and he said they stopped taking it.   Would not have mentioned it to me if I didn't ask. 

I miss the old Middle Eastern Deli that used to be on Independence."}
{"text":"I love Kabob Grill. I'm definitely a creature of habit when it comes to what I order, but have ventured from the norm a few times. My favorite combination is the chicken kabob with two sides. With that I normally get the Omar's salad, which has a light flavored dressing. I also get the potatoes harra. These are potato cubes with lots of garlic.

If you like garlic, definitely order a side of their garlic sauce. It is great for dipping the chicken, potatoes, and bread that is served with the meal.

I've also tried the veggie plate and it provided a lot of variety with just as much flavor. 

Kabob Grill also has a location in Stonecrest at Piper Glen if you end up in South Charlotte and this location has all of the same menu items."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to satisfy a gyro sandwich craving but decided to try one of their lunch specials during this visit. I had the gyro plate and unfortunately, not as good as their gyro sandwich. The plate includes: gyro meat, rice, pita bread, a side salad and fountain drink. The meat was definitely the redeeming element of the plate but everything else left a lot to be desired. The rice was mediocre, the salad consisted of low quality iceberg lettuce with a pretty bland dressing and two small pieces of pita bread. 

Kabob Grill makes a fantastic gyro sandwich but the gyro plate at Stephano's Greek and Mediterranean Grill (located 5 minutes away down Eastern) is far better. To be clear, if you're looking for a top notch gyro sandwich, give Kabob Grill a shot."}
{"text":"Kabob Grill is one of my Charlotte mainstays. I enjoy the freshness and quality of the ingredients as well as the causal, laid-back atmosphere. The hummus (hommos) is really excellent here. My other favorite dish is the lamb kabob wrap - really tasty."}
{"text":"They have a good service. I ordered a cheese dessert that i didn't like, they gave it to me for free and also let me pick another dessert for free. maybe it's because i came here by myself and they're so friendly :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch over the weekend. First time to try the place. The food was good however the portions were disappointing. I ordered the chicken wrap and chicken kabob for my son. My wrap had 5 maybe 6 chunks of chicken in it.  Wrap consisted of mostly wrap and lettuce, very very little chicken. Definitely not worth $10."}
{"text":"Yelp. No. 

I've noticed that yelp reviews in vegas from off the strip can't be trusted. I cannot believe this place has 4 stars. I came in for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu. I was either jipped or the picture on the menu lies to you. I only received one small kabob for my order that cost me $9. Rip off much? My favorite part of the meal was probably the rice..... Sad, I know. 

Not to mention it took me 20 minutes to get my food when I was the only customer there. Isn't this kind-of a fast food joint anyways?"}
{"text":"This place keeps on getting new owners and this was the final time they got our business... Chicken was undercooked, rice was cold as well as the pita bread and the sauce was watered down. At least they finally got our order correct but the food was terrible. The new people are so much more friendlier than the last but unfortunately I don't go to restaurants for the people, it's the food that counts and I like said... we won't be back."}
{"text":"as far as fresh cuisine goes this place is one of the tops in charlotte. we pretty much covered the menu; chicken kabob, mixed grill kabob, tabbouleh, falafel, the potatoes were amazing, tahini sauce, cucumber yogurt sauce even the rice side was made with care. to top all that being a euro beer freak they wet my whistle with a magnat from the ukraine and a golden pheasant from slovakia...truly a taste of food made love, care, and knowledge of mediterranean fare. i'd say as far as fresh ethnic meals go in charlotte only vietnam grill beats this place for me. i will continue to be a frequent guest of the kabob grill... 

oh yeah, being a first timer they gave us each a comp'd cashew baklava and it was dynamite!!! 

go eat here quick, seriously, you will not be let down"}
{"text":"First time here. Food and service was good and fast. I ordered a salad and it was fresh and delicious. At first I was worried about the food from other reviews but had no problems. I will be back to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"I went here for a get-together this weekend. I'm vegan, so I only had the veg items. Everything was very fresh and delicious. The standout dish by far was the baba ganoush appetizer. It was absolute heaven - the best I have ever tasted. As for the vegetarian combo, the falafel was crispy and flavorful. I gave my spinach pie to someone else, but they thought it was mediocre. I don't like parsley, but I actually liked the tabbouleh. If I have any criticism, I would say the pita bread is mediocre. It's quartered and packed in plastic bags. I would prefer it to be heated and served with the dishes instead of being served as a separate item. 

The place is small and clean with a cheery atmosphere. The workers were attentive and nice. If it were possible, I would give it 4.5 stars, but since I have to make a decision to round up or down, I have to go with 5 stars."}
{"text":"Why are kabobs so expensive? It isn't like I don't mind paying for quality food, but come on - meat on a stick? Come to think of it, put meat on a stick at the ren faire and they charge you a lot too, so maybe those sticks just way more than you would think.

Whatever the case, the place isn't much to look at, and the food, while reasonably decent, just isn't much either. Service is friendly, but for the price, it's just not worth it. There are better ways to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I tend to judge a Mediterranean restaurant by their shawarma and falafel, since these are pretty standard and easy to make right (or hard to mess up, if you prefer that phrase). I've been to this place three times, all three times I haven't been impressed. Their shawarma doesn't have a very good flavor, and the falafel sandwich is too dry. I understand that falafel is dry in nature, but it shouldn't be this dry. Btw, the shawarma is dry too, but it seemed better after the falafel. The gyro wrap was alright, but still nothing great.

I would consider driving to La Shish Kabob or even Zeitoni all the way in Ballantyne before I go to this place again."}
{"text":"I had the chicken kebab and for $11.95 it was enough for 2 people.  The chicken was moist and tender, the rice was full of flavor and the salad was fresh.  The restaurant has a clean modern feel, very comfortable seating and the waitress was friendly yet professional."}
{"text":"This place was nicer than I thought it would be. The food is good and the staff was accommodating. I thought the portion sizes were big, but it still seemed over priced.  I may go back if I'm hungry for Mediterranean food or if there's a coupon."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this place. Service wasn't that great and the side of fries were a small handful. The lamb wrap was okay. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Decent place for Mediterranean if you're running errands around the area. I ordered the beef kabob with tabouli salad. The portion for the protein was really small compared to the amount of salad. It was seasoned well, wish it was more tender though.

The server was very attentive, re-filling our water and asking us if we needed anything else. Lots of seating inside, clean, and quiet."}
{"text":"Two words: Rocket Wrap. I was over the moon for the Rocket Wrap during lunch a few days back. Pardon the pun. Or not.

Yes, Ms. Tonya P and I met for lunch and both decided that the Rocket Wrap was our meal of choice and it was damn tasty: falafel, halloum cheese, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and tahini sauce. The falafel was nicely put together, the tahini was on point but the halloum cheese was magical. It was like a mozzarella stick gone wild. LOVE.

While the wrap is generous in size, I have to whine a bit about its price: $10. That seems a bit steep for just a wrap...no side item. However, my dining partner did mention that halloum cheese is pretty pricey, so that's cool. I also had the chance to try a bit of tabouli which was flavorful and nicely seasoned. 

The interior of Kabob Grill isn't much to look at, but with a really delicious Rocket Wrap, I could care less. Service was fine and we never went without beverages! I'll be back, Kabob Grill."}
{"text":"This place is very nice. The ambience is clean, and they play classical music which is nice.... Perfect for lunch and dinner.... I love the gyro salad, ground beef kabob and hummus!! The staff is friendly.... No Apple pay = sad face lol"}
{"text":"Awesome Gryos and their kabob combos. The bread is freshly cooked in open fire and their steak, chicken, and lamb. You can see it for yourself on the grill window."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I have been a loyal customer for over 8 years, over the past year food quality has gone south, service which was getting bad the last few years has gotten worse and ownership is no longer there! And lately staff is horrible, food is disgusting and they have now raised prices twice in less then 18 months! I recently purchased 3 orders of chicken kabob (only 4 oz)  with 2 sides I was charged 23.00 EACH for take out..... Sorry to be so harsh Omar but somehow you have let a great place go to h...! And seems like you longer care and it is showing in food quality and staff!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and friendly service. So glad we found this place! Love that they have different portion sizes as well and specials."}
{"text":"As I recently came here with a buddy for lunch I noticed they have changed or made their menu smaller since the last time I was here last year. I couldn't specifically tell what was different though.

Even though the menu had changed, I was still able to get the affordable and tasty food that I remembered from my last visit.

The gyro wrap I got was generously loaded with seasoned meat with fresh tomatoes, onions, and lettuce, all wrapped up in pita bread that was soft and warm. The tzaziki had such an awesome flavor, I'm glad I ordered extra since I ended up dipping everything in it. I ordered the fries well done and they came out extra crispy with some flavorful seasoning on it.

We also split a chicken kabob plate. The chicken was moist, tender, and had good flavor. The onions and peppers were grilled perfectly while still being crisp. The accompanying salad was filled with fresh and crisp vegetables. 

We had to wait a little bit to receive our food, but I didn't care. I'm willing to wait a little more for freshly made and awesome tasting food. Everything came out correct, hot, and fresh."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good. By far, the best kabobs I've eaten. The lamb kabob was unreal. Kedai chicken, lamb kabob, chicken kabob, beef kabob, mutton bhyriani all incredible. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Everytime I have come to Kabob Grill I always had a great experience! I have been coming here for 3 years, mostly for takeout. The hummus is outstanding. It is a place where you can tell they spend a lot of time making the food authentic and tasty. I would reccomend the lamb kabob with basmati and hummus...yum!

Anyway, I also like the place because the first time I went in with a couple of my girlfriends we all sat outside and ordered food. The owner was so nice and we ended up chatting a little over a couple orders of baklava \"on the house\". My friend Nicole ended up losing her keys that night, and we assumed she lost them somewhere else. I went in to Kabob Grill 6-7 months later and the owner remembered my friend! He handed over the keys and I was so surprised he still had them or had even remembered my friend for that matter. It def. kept me coming back to enjoy the wonderful food/service. Kabob Grill Rocks!"}
{"text":"One of my personal favorite lunch spots, I'm always trying to convince the gang to come here. 

It's the perfect lunch trifecta of Affordable, Fast, and Tasty. On top of that, we can get low-carb, no carb, vegetarian...thank you, Kabob Grill, for making my life this easy.

I usually get either the basic Kabob Meal, or if I am feeling \"craaay-zay\" the gyro meal, because I am a creature of habit, and lame. 

Hummus is also awesome, as is cucumber salad, and I'm not sure but I think they make the pita in house? Either way, I think Kabob Grill is my favorite \"generic middle eastern\" place in Vegas, however pedestrian that might make me. Love em. Can't wait to head back."}
{"text":"my last trip here was terrible. I had heard good things about this place, including the value for the food. The first time I went, I got a vegetarian plate and it was very good. However, the last time (and, I've been told, after management changed), I had a lamb sandwich and it had only 4-5 small pieces of lamb in it. definitely not worth the money for me."}
{"text":"When it comes to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food, I am an easy sell. But there is something about this little joint (and I do mean that in the literal sense) that keeps pulling me back, me back. 

I find comfort in the fact that their employees, at least the handful that I have met, are European. Even if they all aren't off the boat Lebanese, authenticity permeates the building. 

Although I haven't had the pleasure/mispleasure of scarfing yalanji (stuffed grape leaves, otherwise known as dolmades in greek cuisine) while being wooed by the belly dancer, I am not entirely opposed. 

On to the food. We started with the hommos as an appetizer. It is some of the best I have had. Very creamy, nice drizzles of olive oil, and served with pickled vegetables and pita bread. I happen to like pretty much pickled everything, so this works for me. Got to love vinegar. It is a generous portion for 2-4 people, depending on hunger or ambition levels. 

YALANJI. What can I say? These rival my Aunt's, whose I can eat like they are going out of style. Love them. They are the best I have had in Charlotte to date. 

Dinner was Omar's Salad with a lamb skewer. I will complain, because it's fun to do sometimes, that $3.50 for 4 skinny pieces of lamb is steep. Or just call me greedy. Whatever. 

I can say that I have sampled a variety of other dishes here and they are all great. As our waitress said, \"Everything is good!\" 

Do not leave without trying a pistachio baklava and a Turkish coffee for my fellow cardamom lovers out there. 

And bring a mint. :)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the Kabob Grill the first time as we were leaving the Regal Movie Theatre, hungry and deciding where to go. We looked across the parking lot and there it was.The food was fantastic! Tonight it was our destination and again they delivered! Try the yalantis, a sort of Middle Eastern grape leaf rice stuffed dolma. The falafels are just the right kind of crunchy on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside. The falafel salad incorporates the same tasty crunchy falafels with fresh veggies including tomato, cucumber,onions and pickled veggies. The best however are the namesake kabobs. I have had shrimp, lamb and kafka, (seasoned ground beef), and they have been perfectly seasoned and grilled. Can't wait for the next dinner and a movie, (or perhaps just dinner!)"}
{"text":"Unless you have money to just throw in the wind, this Mediterranean joint is not worth your time - or your money. For $36, we got two shawarma wraps and sides of falafel. For $3 extra, you can swap the side of fries the wraps come with for any other side. Sweet deal? Not even close. What we got is two sad, over cooked pieces of falafel. The wraps were just so-so - protein was, again, over cooked. Seeing a theme here? Seriously, if you're looking for authentic flavors and don't mind the drive, La Shish Kabob is worth your time and is easy on your wallet. It doesn't have the ambiance you're paying for at Kabob Grill, but you won't walk out as angry as we just did."}
{"text":"The lamb chops are delicious,  large portions, friendly service and reasonably priced.   I wish there was a location on the West side in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I've had take out here about 3 times now and it has always been good! I always call in before  I go so I don't have to wait and it's ready in about 10 minutes... The service is friendly especially the gentleman who I assume is either the manager or owner. You order the counter and there is both indoor and patio seating available. The prices are fair as well as the portions.. The dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) are addicting and have a delicious lemon taste to them! 


HOT TIP: If you like vinaigrette for your salad then request the lemon and oil dressing upon ordering.. If not, they usually give you a creamy sauce.. Also, they can toss the salad for you in the dressing and some special Mediterranean seasoning if you request it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mediterranean food and this is so close.  But between the $20 vegetarian plate (come on now) and more than one rude experience- maybe not so much rude but more of an I can't be bothered attitude by the people on the phone when calling in my order, I have to say farewell.  I would take their rudeness bc I love my veggie plate there if I also wasn't shelling out $20 before tax, but I am.  I wish I didn't have to give such a weak review but if you are going to charge this much it needs to be in a nicer setting and the service needs to be kind.  I would prefer you moved to cheaper space, reduced your prices, and you can Soup Nazi me all you want, but you can't have both."}
{"text":"Ordered take out to pick up.
Two salads w a protein, and an appetizer portion of hummus. No drinks. $38 freaking dollars. 
I thought once I got it home I would be wowed. I said WOW alright. Wow, what a joke.
Chopped lettuces w chopped tomato, cucumber and onion with a pathetic kabob. The kabobs were a skinny skewer of 5 pieces of 1\"x1\" lamb or chicken that was overcooked. Yes, you read that right. 1\" sq.  
The hummus had little taste, but perhaps it was because I had such a bad taste in my mouth from being ripped off."}
{"text":"We were hard pressed to find gyros on a Sunday, as most of the other Greek places are closed. 

While gyros aren't actually on the menu here, they're happy to prepare it for you if you ask. It differs from the fast food \"Americanized\" version, but in the best way possible. The pitas taste like they're made in-house (not sure on that one though) and it comes with hummus and an array of spices that make it so delicious. 

And now I'm craving one. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was pretty good. I felt like it was pricey at first but when I got my meal I like that I received a good amount of food. I got the number 15 and that comes with a huge steak and chicken skewers on top of rice and a side of salad and 4 slices of peta bread with humus. It was really delicious and filled me up. Plus the service was great. Got friendly service as soon as I stepped inside."}
{"text":"Nice selection of Mediterranean foods. Waitress recommended wine from Lebanon, really nice blend. A few sidewalk tables and about a dozen inside tables. Like others said, not fancy decor but friendly service and great food. I'll go back."}
{"text":"this place is amazing. i use to come here at least 4 times a week and take left overs home and actually eat them! i NEVER eat left overs...my dog usually does. the baklava is great and individually packaged. i always get the chicken and rice with taziki sauce. the owners are nice and their staff. they always greet me by my name. i LOVE when people remember me for who i am not for another transaction."}
{"text":"Hi quality fresh Mediterranean food (think falafel, olives, eggplant, hummus, tzatziki, tabbouleh, etc) and fast, friendly service.  Best place for Mediterranean food in ballantyne area"}
{"text":"Kabob Grill offers delicious Middle Eastern food, and we love going when we have a craving for kabobs. The food is really flavorful and delicious, and the service has always been fast and friendly.

The lentil soup is better than the mulligatawny soup we usually get at Indian restaurants. It's served with crispy pita chips that are a nice compliment.  

I have had both the vegetarian combo and the grilled shrimp kabobs. Both are divine. The veggie combo gives you a taste of everything, but my favorites are the falafel (truly the best I have EVER had), hummus (or hommos, as they spell it), the yalanji (stuffed grape leaves), and the potato harra (lemony and delicious). The portions are so generous that I usually have leftovers. 

The shrimp kabobs are nine large and deliciously tasty shrimp, along with two sides. I usually get the falafel and hummus, with an extra side of rice. You get pita bread with your meal, and while I like that it's free, it is never warm and does not taste like it is made in-house. 

My hubby always gets the mixed grill combo. It comes with one skewer each of chicken, steak, lamb, and ground beef. He has had the tabouleh, tahini sauce, yogurt sauce, rice, and falafel as his sides. No complaints from him on any of these dishes!

One note- there are only seven or eight tables in the place, and a handful of seats at the bar.  We usually get there around  6pm because the tables fill up fast.  Service is pretty fast, however, so I'm sure the wait would never be very long.

The food is a great value and while we live in Lake Norman, we definitely feel Kabob Grill is worth the frequent trip. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Their chicken kabob is so delicious. Their potato bites are so perfect too. The French fries here are to die for."}
{"text":"I was in Kabob grill on TUES Nov 29th, sitting at a table working on my MacBook when the owner OMAR KWEIBER  spilled water on my new laptop, causing it to immediately shutoff.  There was a restaurant full of witnesses this day.   He offered to put my computer in a bin of rice in the back, and gave me his insurance company's information.   He is now LYING and saying he did not spill water on my laptop.  I am asking anyone who was there that day and witnessed this to please come forward.  OMAR is not being an upstanding person or business owner.  He is directly responsible for the damage caused to my laptop, and I am asking for him to pay to have it repaired or replaced.   I am not only frustrated but appalled by how he has treated me since this occurred.   Everyone in the Charlotte area should be made aware of how OMAR KWEIBER is treating his customers.  He didn't even offer to comp my $24 meal.    Please contact me if you can be of any help with this matter, thank you."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with my wife last weekend and it was an epic fail. Reasons:
1. Ten minutes after we ordered, the appetizer had not arrived. Since our server had disappeared we asked another to check on it but she never got back to us with an answer.  The appetizer eventually showed up - much later - at the same time as our entree. 
2. We chose a salad but made it clear we wanted one without parsley, but when it came with the meal, it was covered with parsley. We then requested rice as a replacement and it was grudgingly granted. 
3. The lamb on the lamb kebob was dry and tasteless - more like lamb jerky - my wife even wondered what kind of meat it was - sure was the worst lamb we'd ever had
4. We split the meal but the price was more than $35 - FAR more than it was worth, even if the food had been half-way decent. especially since I only had water and wife had sweet tea. So that price was for one appetizer, one entree, and one drink and a 15% tip. Yikes!

PS - at least the fries were good"}
{"text":"FABULOUS!  You don't think there is much to this place when you show up. In a strip mall the restaraunt is small but nicely decorated, the dark woods make it feel very intimate. Every thing on the menu sounded wonderful I went with the lamb kabob, my husband the lamb sauté we had the hummus appetizer. The hommos was the best we have had even better than some of the places in Turkey and Bahrain."}
{"text":"Awesome service here! The lady who took my order was very kind and helpful! I LOVE it when I have great service at any place (shops, restaurants, etc)

I wanted to eat outside and she was more than willing to bring my food out side for me (after I told her I was eating inside when ordering.) But I decided to be spontaneous since it was a nice day out (yet windy.)  One of the many reasons why I had to go back in to give them a tip $, since it was rather windy outside. I'll be back! :) I forgot to use the 10% check in offer though... :( oh well, next time!

Btw... the food was great, I had the greek salad. It was more than enough, huge plate of salad and huge slices of lamb and the sauce automatically came on the side. :)"}
{"text":"Love the food, dislike the ethics.

I order with Foodie Call regularly,
and Kabob Grill often changes portion size
because you aren't picking it up yourself...
same price, plus the price of delivery with FC,
but the size of the portion is small.
This seems sketchy to me, Kabob Grill."}
{"text":"The owner( bald guy kinda chubby) of this place is a scum. He's rude obnoxious and ill-mannered. He has no respect for females what so ever. I never even dined at this place but I happen to  come in contact with him outside of this place at another establishment and he made it known that he's the \"owner of kabob grill and it's been around for 20 yrs\" take your kabob and shove it sir. The nerve of you. Next time you decide to be rude and insult me make sure you don't tell me what business you own."}
{"text":"Was just there for second time.  We had both a chicken and beef tenderloin soltani.  Excellent!  Also had an order of hummus.  This is the best hummus I've had in Las Reminds me of the best hummus I'd get in SE Michigan, and as good as mine.  No added flavors to distract from the tahini.  A definite place to go make a regular."}
{"text":"I used points from my employer's reward program to purchase a restaurant dot com gift certificate ($10 for $20) I'm in the area frequently; Smoothie King, Harris Teeter, Menchie's... but Kabob Grill escaped me, so when I googled the location I was pleasantly surprised I didn't have to travel out of my way :) I was also pleased with the food. I ordered one each Beef and chicken Kabob Wrap and a side of basmati rice (which I could have eaten by itself it was very good!) The taste of the kabobs were excellent, I enjoyed the flavor of the hommos. I believe the Pita Wraps were priced within value. I will definietely return to try the entree portions but the price point seems a bit high."}
{"text":"Oh my! If I did eat meat whoa! But still I enjoy coming here for salad , hummus, and other vegetarian stuff... in other words there's a few vegetarian option. But my friends order their kabobs and I heard it's a knocker! . I'm not going to give it less star just because the parking can be a little tight specially peak hours .... lunch time can be bad. Bait if you don't mind walking a little bit it'll be fine. We can all use a walk. Hehehehe. Happy kabobing!"}
{"text":"Apparently there are new owners here since March 1st. Nothing has suffered and the new owners even added lamb chops to the menu. After moving to  the Las Vegas area from Chicago land we searched for the best gyros sandwich and luckily found Kebob Grill. Had a gyros sandwich tonight and it was perfectly prepared and had abundant meat in it. Thanks to the new owners and good luck with your restaurant. We will be repeat customers as we were for the original owners."}
{"text":"Had the lamb gyro meal and it was pretty expensive for a lunch meal, the size of the food made up for the cost, the flavor wasn't the greatest. Need to have a lunch special and half the size of the meal."}
{"text":"Food here is always great and very reasonable priced, i am never disappointed when i come here. i love the steak kabob and fries!! Employees always greet me with kindness. I love eating here because they play good music and it's always clean!!"}
{"text":"Had the Mixed Grill kabob dinner - kafta, chicken, steak, and lamb with potato harris and Omar's salad.  I have had kabobs n NYC, DC, and northern VA, but none have kabobs as good & tasty as I get here.  Friendly attentive staff."}
{"text":"Great find for Mediterranean food! Quaint and clean. Order at the counter. Ambiance is very casual. The food is great."}
{"text":"This is a terrific lunch option. I had a chicken kabob platter over their house salad with a side of pita and hummus. The chicken was well marinated and delicious, but the real winner was the hummus! It was incredible! I actually took my leftover hummus home and snacked on it afterwards. And the pita was so soft and delicious. 

The prices are fair and the restaurant is very clean. Good location on Eastern. The service was friendly and, although it did take a little while to get my platter, it was well worth the wait!  

There was a check-in offer for a free fountain drink, which is a plus. Will definitely be back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Holy wow! The mixed vegetables are amazing.  Tabbouleh is very flavorful.  Great tender meats in the mixed grill. You do not expect this kind of food from a little shop in the side of the shopping center.  Super nice people too."}
{"text":"I love the food whether dining in or take out 5 stars!!
Low key place right next to dish it out"}
{"text":"We (4 of us) were regulars here - and loved the menu, food and service - I would have given it 5 stars.  HOWEVER.....We went there this week and were very disappointed that they changed their menu format.....It's almost ala carte style now.  My favorite used to be the chicken combo which included a salad and half a grilled tomato.  I ordered the \"New\" chicken kabob, and did not like it with green peppers and onions and did not care for the whole grilled tomato that was not .75 extra.  And the plates that they now use seem \"cheap\".  Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"I've ordered Kabob Grill from Eat24Hours.com a few times on Sundays when I was feeling exceptionally lazy (if laziness was an Olympic event, on any given Sunday I'd be the Usain Bolt of it).   I love that it provides a delivery option in my area that isn't pizza or chinese/thai, though I have mad love for both of those options.   Respect due to pizza hut.   Anyway, the thought of hot and fresh gyro meat and falafel balls being delivered to my doorstep as I sit on my bed unshowered watching reruns of No Reservations sends me into euphoria.  

On this day I had a $5 off coupon emailed to me from Eat24Hours which made it all even more appealing, and I ordered some falafel appetizers, a gyro salad, and chicken soltani, which consists of a chicken kabob along with a piece of kabob koobideh, which is a skewered minced meat kabob, all on top of a heaping of basmati rice.  Delivery was estimated to happen between 45 and 60 minutes, and I was happy when a delivery driver from Kabob Grill rang my doorbell 30 minutes later.  The first item I tried was the falafel.   I found it to be a nice version of one of my favorite foods, though texture-wise it was a little different than I'm used to as I could still make out little pieces of chopped up carrots within the fried outer shell.  It wasn't off-putting in the least, but I do slightly prefer a uniform texture throughout that I'm used to.  Next I tried the Gyro Salad, and while the gyro meat was plentiful and tasty, I was a little disappointed that there was no feta cheese.  Now I must say the menu doesn't mention feta so there shouldn't be any expectation of feta from me in that sense... no, I take it back, I WANT FETA!   The veggies seemed fresh and crisp and overall I was pleased otherwise.   Lastly to the Chicken Soltani.  The pieces of chicken skewer were large, moist and flavorful, which is about all you can ask for from chicken in my opinion.   The koobideh kabob also had a great flavor to it, and I enjoyed stuffing a piece of pita with rice and one meat or the other and some veggies.   This actually brings me to my biggest disappointment of the entire order (feta notwithstanding).   There were only 2 pieces of pita provided with this meal!  I don't mean two large pieces either, I'm talking two small triangles that would normally last 20 seconds in any given mediterranean restaurant I might dine in.  Instead I found myself rationing them out like I was stranded on a desert island.  Maybe I'm used to being spoiled with Pita from Hedary's, but  I felt like there should be some extra considering the amount of food ordered.

When it's all said and done, I can highly recommend Kabob Grill to satisfy your delivery (and probably take out/dine-in) cravings, though you might want to have some feta in the fridge and order an extra side of pitas to make yours a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"I just went there yesterday and found out that there is new management and owner. I've always love their food until now. The meat is dry and no taste.  Their rice does not have the aromatic smell anymore. Sad to say I won't be coming here in the near future."}
{"text":"Love a good family owned, small Greek place. Tasted authentic, was cheap, and came with lots of food. Tzatziki, hummus, and bakalava were amazing and so fresh!! Also not expensive in the least!"}
{"text":"I was previously stationed in Saudi Arabia, so I know what good Mediterranean food should be like.  This place nailed it!

While it was not as spicy as the Middle-East, the food was quite flavorful.  We got the Baba-Ghanoush (awesome!) for a starter followed by the mixed grille with hummus and potatoes.  I agree with Michelle B. about the acidity of the potatoes, but they were still very tasty and not worth a star penatly.  Mixed grill was fabulous - Chicken the best, followed closely by the beef and kofta and then the lamb was the weakest but still tasty.  To wash it all down, I had Turkish Coffee - made right and even served in the traditional pitcher.

Service was as good as it could be.  My water stayed full, my friend's tea stayed full and the pitas kept coming.

If you can't make it to Turkey, Saudi, or Dubai, this place is pretty close to the real deal."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to a yummy lunch, and we were more than disappointed. The food was nearly inedible and the waiter never inquired as to our satisfaction. The sandwich was ten dollars and there was almost no lamb to be found in the wrap. When the bill came, there was an extra charge for the fries that the waiter told us came with it!  The owner came over and kept telling us that the menu showed the side was not included. After he said he would take off the extra charge, i told him that the food was not good, his tone became menacing. Then he put the charge back on the bill. We didn't argue further because we felt threatened. DON't go here. This was about the worst dining experience we have ever had!"}
{"text":"Took some friends to lunch and I had a taste for gyros.  Fantastic, lots to choose from, freshly made.

We ordered, steak, chicken, shrimp, vegetable kabobs, gyros plate and stuffed grape leaves.

We shared all the dishes.  Only thing that disappointed me was the grape leaves.  I thought to much lemon.  But everyone has a different taste for things. 

Restaurant was clean, fast and friendly.  We sat around for about an hour and they didn't mind at all.  I would definitely recommend this place if you want to indulge you inner greek"}
{"text":"Cannot stay away from Kabob Grill this food is so delicious.  Chicken kabob witt garlic sauce and the usual 3 sides"}
{"text":"This is a small and very plainly furnished establishment on Pecos.  They serve the basics you would expect of a Middle Eastern restaurant: kabobs, salads, taboule, baba ghanoush, hummus, pita bread, gyros, etc. plus a few things I am less familiar with. You place your order at the register and they assemble your order behind the counter. 

I've been here when service has been slow, but the food has always been good and tastes fresh. The tables and chairs have always been clean during my visit.   Parking hasn't been a problem; if you can't park at the storefront there is parking in front of the other nearby establishments."}
{"text":"Food: 
- Beef Gyro: Very typical gyro, wasn't super good but wasn't bad either. Came wrapped like a big cigar served in a plastic basket. Wrapped with typical supermarket pita bread and the filling was alright. 

Service: 
Kinda neglectful and very neutral. Didn't feel too welcomed or particularly nice to us. My friend ordered a meal deal and the waiter didn't even bother to ask my friend what drink he wanted. My friend had to chase him down and ask for the drink. 

Ambiance: 
Very casual lunch spot. Very small and cozy. 

Price: 
Typically priced for a gyro. Had lunch specials where you can get a gyro, drink and fries, but it wasn't like a super good deal or anything. 

Overall: 
I'm a HUGE Gyro fan and I love Medit. food but this place wdidn't really hit the spot...probably won't come again."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but I thought it was a little over priced for the amount of food I received.  I had a take out order of the beef soltani and eggplant dish. For 14.99 the soltani came with a small and slender piece of kubideh and beef tenderloin."}
{"text":"Nothing that I ordered really impressed me. I've had way better Mediterranean food in town. The soda machine wasn't working properly and the staff didn't try to help or offer a refund so watered down lemonade it was. Go up the street to Stephanos."}
{"text":"We love eating at Kabob Grill. The staff is very friendly and the food is excellent. We really enjoy the lamb kabobs, falafel, and the hummus is smooth and creamy. On Tuesday and Wednesday they have 1/2 price bottles of wine. If you are looking for a change of pace from the average food choices offered by Charlotte restaurants give Kabob Grill a try."}
{"text":"This place is okay, but just OK.  

I recently went to Kabob Grill for dinner and was reminded of why I haven't dined here in years.  We ordered two entrees - the vegetarian platter and the mixed grill.  We did not order beverages. Consistent with my prior experience at Kabob Grill, I thought it was overpriced as our two dishes came out to $34 before tip.  So figure $41 all in.  I can do a lot better for $41 both terms of volume of food and quality.  

My first impression of the food was a bad one.  The pitas came out in little plastic bags.  They were really thin and dry and pretty much unappetizing.  The vegetarian platter looks really nice.  But I just didn't find it very flavorful.  Heck, I can walk over to the Harris Teeter next door at getter better hummus.  Hmmm... actually, I can get pitas at HT that are Way better too.  This should not be the case!  My kabobs were cooked reasonably well, but they were pretty scrawny looking kabobs.  Definitely looked like they were cutting costs by going small on the amount of meat they give you.  I also thought they were a little bland.  

I imagine Kabob Grill largely survives based on its location.  I don't think it would stand a chance if it were somewhere like Central Ave where it would be competing against many options for inexpensive ethnic restaurants.  It's in a convenient location and the food is relatively healthy.  But that's really all I can give this place for strengths.  I'm being kind by giving it 3 stars. The more I think about it, 2 may be more appropriate."}
{"text":"Every city has a solid, reasonably priced middle eastern food place. Kabob grill is this place for Charlotte. The people who work here are wonderful, the food is delicious, the ambiance is great, and it won't break your wallet. The standard falafel bar that all middle eastern places must meet to be acceptable is met and then some. Bonus points for halloumi cheese and Turkish coffee. Kabob grill is never a regret"}
{"text":"BEST falafel I have had in Charlotte.  That's all I was hoping for and I found it.  That is all I want to share!"}
{"text":"Being my first time I decided to go somewhat basic, but also pick something based on reviews I read and photos.
I ordered pickup, chicken kebab dinner with Omar's salad and potatoes. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and moist, the best part of the meal. The salad, unfortunately had way too much cilantro for my taste I couldn't even eat it and the potatoes were good, but some underdone and very greasy. I will blame some of that on the fact it was a to go order.
The service was just okay, while I waited for my food, and I thought it was a little pricey for the portion. Not sure I would return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a poor review because I have had such great experiences at the location on East Blvd. but for my first (and last) time at the Rea Road location it was terrible.  We went for a friend's birthday, Friday night-steady guests but certainly not full.  We waited an entire hour for our entrees and then after continuously letting our server know we needed to get to a movie still had to wait more than 20 minutes for the bill.  Food and suggestions were simply fair.  Very disappointed.  I won't be back to this location, EVER."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice so far but have loved everything I've gotten. Great hummus. That's all I need to say. Will be back more often."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The menu was easy to understand. It doesn't have very many many things on to chooses from. But they make it so well. The chicken and lamb or marinated to Perfection have the right amount spices on it.  I will be back for sure.  I had a lamb ground kabob and chicken. The give you a ton of food for the price."}
{"text":"One of the better Mediterranean options in Charlotte! Fiancé got chicken shawarma and baba ghannouj. I got a Omar salad. Portions were well sized and everything had a good flavor. A little pricey but will definitely return for the good food and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently visited Kabob Grill while vacationing in Charlotte for the weekend. We ordered a falafel wrap with a piece of baklava to-go for lunch. Both items were good, but the prices seemed very high for dinner and still pricey for lunch. I've definitely had better falafel wraps for less money in larger cities, but Kabob Grill does offer more options than just falafel. There's something counter-intuitive to me about restaurants with high prices located in strip malls, but at least I haven't been disappointed by the food. 

I can't speak for the rest of their menu, but I would recommend Kabob Grill for anyone interested in falafel wraps at lunch time. The parking situation seemed a little scarce considering we went on a Sunday, but there is more parking available at other locations along the street."}
{"text":"I order the beef kaboob which came with persian bread and rice my gawd what a wonderful find in this place I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, quantity was enough. The service was good. I ordered in entrees shworma wrap and churn kabob. Falafel in appetizer. All the dishes.  We're very tasty. Ambience was nice, and as it was lunch time so they have happy hours during that time. I enjoyed my lunch. The chiken kabob was little uncooked I felt and it was lil higher in prize compare to the rest of Mediterranean restaurant around. But than food quality was good."}
{"text":"Love this place and have been coming here for many years. Food and staff are always exceptional."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the service was decent.  The food is good, but I thought it was expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I had to dock a star for the unreasonable lunch prices. I can literally get 2 lunch chicken shwarma plates with lentil soup at Jasmine's for the price of 1 lunch chicken shwarma plate (no soup or rice included) at the Kabob Grill. Prices have gone up a lot since I've been here last. I do have to admit, the quality of food is good here. You can order salads without worrying about wilted lettuce. The falafel wrap I had today was a good size, though I'd rather pay about $7-8 like I used to. Needed salt. They have done a nice remodeling job to give the place a more modern look, looks much better now."}
{"text":"When I'm hungry for Mediterranean food in the Dilworth area, Kabob Grill is on my list. With super fresh ingredients and delicious vegetarian fare, it's definitely an easy choice for the Mr and me.

I usually order the vegetarian combo, which includes items such as tabbouleh, hummus, falafel, potato harra, Omar's salad, or a plethora of other choices.

The Mr goes with the Chicken Shawarma Wrap and devours it so quickly I can't even get a good look at it!

So why only 3 stars?

The hummus is pretty boring. The prices are inflated for dinner. For reference, at Kabob Grill, a vegetarian plate and chicken shawarma wrap cost us $24 for takeout before a tip; no drinks or extras included. I have had similar meals that cost significantly less at other Mediterranean restaurants.

I know it's a mainstay, and I appreciate its convenience to our home. But I wish there were a little more love put into some of the dishes...and that they didn't charge so much."}
{"text":"The veggie kabob lunch special is delicious. Zucchini, tomatoes, onion, mushrooms and bell pepper all seasoned to perfection and grilled. Paired with rice and salad then add a side of hummus to complete your meal!!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"So I came here for the first time with my Dad. 
Was ok. 
The service was great, the guys behind the counter were very nice, and pleasant. 
The good parts about the food:
The HUMMUS is amazing, and so is the pitas they give with it.
The yogurt dip is fantastic, I could just eat that and be happy.

Stuff I didn't like:
-The falafel was just ok. Kinda too thick and soggy in side, I like mine a little more crisp.
-My dad hated the grape leaves, he couldn't not figure out what was inside. Some kinda of quinoa  grain. Idk. He didn't eat it, I felt bad, I didn't think it was bad.
-So I got the falafel gyro, and instead of their wonderful pita , they serve this horrible over cooked, too thick weird cracker crust thing... I was like wtf is this? I want pita bread not dry cracker. It ruined everything. Had a ton of left over cracker bread, cause I picked it off... Makes the meal dry and over carbed.

The price was ok, the portions were fine. Everything tasted ok, but that cracker bread thing I cannot get over. 

I will go back, and write a new review if I try anything else."}
{"text":"The lamb kabob was cooked perfectly. Tabooleh and falafel were fantastic. Finished off with knafeh. Must try!"}
{"text":"It's SO unfortunate that the original Iranian owner decided to sell this place to a strange family that doesn't know the first thing about Mediterranean service or food. They're RUDE, especially the lady. They want to pass their cheap ingredients off as authentic. They use *fake* basmati rice and they use FOOD COLORING in place of saffron! They're not fooling anybody. Today, I was served RAW, BLOODY chicken. I decided to just leave it alone, walk out, and never go back. 

Such a shame. The food used to be SO delicious here and made from the heart. Then the owner sold it to these inexperienced people and this place went to hell. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was very happy with all of the foods had. Hummus, chicken Kebob with falafel and their potato side. So delicious! I would totally go back there! Tried my husband's lamb Kebob and it was also very tasty. Love the spice combinations and flavors. Definitely a place to visit again. Only problem was the parking. They are currently doing something to the Parking lot so it was tough to find a spot."}
{"text":"I have been to this place few time and they've been great to me every time and the food is delicious, if you are looking for a great mediterranean food! This is place to be.. definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went for dinner before a movie and the place was deserted. No bartender, no host, no manager to be seen. We sat ourselves and waited about 10min before I went to the back kitchen to ask what appeared to be the dishwasher if someone could help us. The manager finally waited on us, but it was slow service."}
{"text":"Chicken kabob, baba, must o khiar, falafel, baklava, hummus, all really good. If it did not feel a little \"fast foodie\" it would be better.
I recommend the chicken kabob highly. The baklava is, according to my wife, fantastic. The hummus was good, and the baba ganoush was awesome.
I will be going back."}
{"text":"I waited maybe 7 minutes between walking in, ordering and walking out the door. It was Friday at about 5:30 pm if that helps.

My falafael wrap was so yummy. The bread was amazing. People say it's over priced but $6 gets you a dry flavorless falafel with a fucking hard ass pita and iceberg lettuce and mushy tomatoes. I am not down with that.

With my delicious Falafael I got the potatoes with olive oil and red pepper. Oh my F-ing goodness!!!! They are so delicious. They were cooked perfectly. They are not supposed to be crispy like french fries. I would eat them all the time if there wasn't so much oil. I loved the oil I just couldn't do it more than 2x a month. So good though. If you don't care about health or your diet allows them that day, you should definitely get them haha!!! 

The lentil soup was eh... Okay. Maybe I'm used to Lebanese lentil soup but I like chunks and cumin seed in mine. This was blended smooth. Small but lentil soup is kind of a things to me. Haha. 

I highly recommend. It's about $20 for one person and I ate it all in one sitting so the portions aren't monstrous. Good luck!"}
{"text":"There's something to be said about the atmosphere of Kabob Grill. Genuine kindness and gratitude is hard to come by in the world of fast food and fast service but here, you actually want to stay to enjoy your meal. The owners are lovely and the food is truly delicious. Fresh flavors of homemade dressing, tzatziki and hummus go so well with the kabobs and warm pita bread. What a great meal and absolutely gracious hosts. We can't wait to come back. Thank you, Kabob Grill!"}
{"text":"This a wonderful Mediterranean restaurant!  The food and service can not be better.  The restaurant offers a very pleasant atmosphere and an excellent selection of beer from around the world.  The prices are most reasonable.  I highly recommend you eat here."}
{"text":"The good the staff is polite the falafel is good the ambience is a nice and clean restaurant

The bad: overpriced"}
{"text":"I think I found another local gem. Pleasantly surprised by this unassuming mediterranean joint tucked away in a Dilworth strip mall. Tried the lamb shawerma yesterday on my first visit and couldn't stop thinking about it so I'm back today for more. And I knew they were special when I asked for hot sauce and they brought out the sriacha instead of Tabasco or Pete's.

Will try their wraps next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places. Steak kabob is always on point, chicken kabob is great but occasionally over cooked. Pretty quick service, my wife loves the rice. The wraps are great as well."}
{"text":"When we think of Mediterranean, we automatically think of Kabob Grill.  They have pretty standard prices, but when they have their deal via text, we usually make it point to patron there during the deal days.  .

The large platter- comes with 2 skewers and 3 sides of your choice.  My favorite are the hummus, dolmas (grape leaves), the falafels (come out hot and super flavorful and packs a punch), house salad, and babaganoush.  Their yellow rice is the house favorite and I usually opt-out for healthier options.  

Their gyros are pretty standard, a little on salty side, but always the same flavoring.  They're not lightly pan fried after being off the spit, which might give it crispy edges.
The shrimp is cooked well over open flame, buttery flavor and I love dipping it in their tzaziki sauce.  
The cubed steak is cooked medium, which seals in the flavor.  It's good tender meat and sure to satisfy the meat craving.
The chicken is always tender here and they never overcook it.  This is probably the healthier option compared to the gyro and buttered shrimp.  

It's a casual atmosphere, clean place to dine and we always come back here for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I ordered a plate with chicken, shrimp and veggie kabobs & sides of house salad and falafel. The falafel was my favorite! Must try these if you're a fan. The kabobs were very good and juicy! I was not impressed by their house salad, it wasn't Greek-just regular salad. I'll say I do think it's pretty pricey as well. I got 5 kabobs and 2 sides for $22. At least Tzatziki was free!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is seriously yummy and always fresh. Beware, the crazy fries are highly addictive."}
{"text":"I've been getting food from this place for a couple of years. Before I go any further, I should mention that I LOVE tzatziki sauce. I always make sure to be clear that I want tzatziki with my food. Once in a while they'll forget to put it in the bag, so my husband and I always check to make sure it's actually there. Tonight, for some reason, my husband decided to ask if the sauce was in the bag, rather than check. They said yes, but of course it wasn't. My husband was kind enough to drive back and get it for me. When he told the man at the counter that there wasn't any tzatziki in the bag, the guy got really defensive and started throwing a bunch of it in a bag. So why the two star rating? The guy made a mistake and, when confronted about it, got a bad attitude and acted like my husband was out of line asking for the sauce. In addition, the food quality has gone down. I'm really not enjoying the food as much as I used to.

On the plus side, I now have 10 things of tzatziki."}
{"text":"Not much to add. The food is excellent. The staff is nice enough. If it's busy, seating is limited and the wait can be more than I will stand for.
The prices are on the higher end, but the food is better than \"fast food\". Plan to spend around $10 per person. 
Also, if your order is under $5, they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"I was heading to Henderson for an appointment and in an adventurous mood while driving down S. Eastern Ave.  Along the way I looked around for cool places to check out, when the traffic has stopped at traffic lights and it was safe to do of course, for things to do and kind of planning my lunch for the day.

So my first stop was this tiny Asian market that also serves breakfast and boba drinks (it is just next door) and it didn't look too appealing to me.  So I walked next door to Kabob Grill, and reminiscing about the handful of great Persian restaurants I have been referred to try or been taken to in California.  The menu looks simple enough, and they have the basic kabob varieties you expect from a decent Persian restaurant, not to mention one that specializes in kabobs.  And they even have the ground beef kabob (Kabaabe Koobideh) that I prefer over most other items on the menu.  Lunch is already off to a good start!

So after debating if I should get their lunch special or just ordering the same Ground Beef in the Main Dishes section, I went with the Large Main Dishes version of Ground Beef (which is served with rice, onions, pita bread, butter and optional grilled tomato and two skewers of ground beef) at $9.99.  The lunch special version comes with just 1 skewer of meat (except the \"Soltani\" items, which serves two combinations of skewer meats), rice, salad, onions, pita bread and fountain drink with price ranging from $8.49 to $13.49. In general the Main Dishes items are a $1 more than their equivalent in the lunch specials.

I didn't bother to take pictures of the exterior or interior, thinking that other Yelpers surely have reviewed this place already.  So no photos, except the food I ordered.  But I will say that their display case is beautifully stocked with various canned and bottled beverages and some homemade pastries. The menu and the paint scheme on the wall matches, and utilizes the vibrant green, yellow and white colors.  The décor is simple, with black marbled-top tables and matching black cushion chairs arranged around the average size dining area of the restaurant.

Anyway, service is okay. It is just another \"step up to the counter and order your food, wait for it to be prepared and pick it up at the counter when your number is called\" kind of fast casual food service operation. They greet you when you walk in, but not when you have finished your meal and walking out the door.

Food-wise, it looks good. And if you can drool and imagine just how wonderful it tastes just looking at pictures, then they would get 4-5 stars for \"food styling\".  But based on just trying one item out of the 13 they have available in their Main DIshes section of the menu, I would say this is a 3 stars (A-OK) at best.  My ground beef kabob was juicy (always a plus), but flavor and seasoning-wise it was just okay. Just like a McDonald's burger is okay, but not potentially awesome like the much more expensive gourmet burger from Burger Bar, and you are not paying all that much.

BUT I was disappointed that they did not served the \"optional\" grilled tomato, which is clearly shown in the sample photos for the items. I am not sure if you have to specify you want the \"optional\" grilled tomato, or they simply just don't have it (not likely, since they served sliced tomatoes in the salads I see others ordering) or forgot to put it on my plate.  And I have to say the juiciness and sweetness of the tomato really adds to the flavor profile of the dish, and helps cut the feeling of fattiness mouthfeel after consuming some of the kabob.

Value for the money -  2 stars compared to most restaurants in the fast casual category.  But Persian foods have always cost a little more at restaurants, so I guess 3 stars compared to other Persian kabob fast casual restaurants.

Interesting stuff (at least I think it is) - Kabob Burgers. Kabobs served with the onions, sliced tomato and a lettuce stuffed between burger buns.

They also have an interesting Appetizers and Salad menus. Babaganoush looks good in the picture.  And I want to try their inexpensive but still interesting Shirazy Salad (chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, parsley topped with lemon juice and olive oil for $3.99).
 
This is my first Yelp review of a Persian \"restaurant\" in Las Vegas, so I will give it a 3 stars. Par for the course to compare others to, otherwise it would be a 2 stars for not going above and beyond the bare minimal in service, food preparation and omitting item (I want that grilled tomato gosh darn it!) that should come with the food you order.

{"text":"This place is awesome I had the best service ever and all their food is so authentic and fresh! I will definitely be back here ! And this review is coming from someone who hardly ever leaves reviews, but they really deserve it. The atmosphere and friendliness of the staff is outstanding it's a must try! Thank You Kabob Grill I had a great time!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food but service was bad enough to convince me to never go back. Owner was rude to waitress and customers. Very high strung."}
{"text":"Our office is in the same shopping center and we have lunch here about 3 times a week its delicious. healthy, and the employees are very nice always going the extra mile to make our order just right. i would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone who is trying to have some healthy and great food."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Definitely fresh. It took 15-20 minutes to cook the kabobs. So definitely know you won't get your meal right away. The tables and condiment sections were clean and kept up with supplies."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place and finally found myself here one night all because I was craving hummus and pita bread. All I can say is, YUM! It's so delicious that I dont intend to go anywhere else. Thankfully it is right up the street from my house. Win, win!

We tried a couple other things on the menu as well. My 3 sons all had a chicken plate, which they said was delicious. I believe them, seeing as they ate it all. Everything but the salad that is, which I gladly took off their plates because it was sooo fresh, crisp and refreshing! 

I can't wait to try other items on the menu now that I've opted to step more out of my comfort zone when eating out. On that note, I can't wait to come back."}
