{"text":"This place is just for take-out, there is indoor seating but it's not the best. They're fast and yummy but their take on Thai is defiantly Chinese, a tad greasy but well worth it if your into pad Thai."}
{"text":"This is where you'll find possibly the best Pad Thai in the Beaches, if not all of Toronto! Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Amazing food but you got to get delivery. The 1 star off the 5 was that it reminded me of a sheltered chip truck in rural northern ontario. Great price, great menu and excellent service."}
{"text":"Huge helping of pad thai (good for 2 or 3 meals) and 2 spring rolls. Best I've ever eaten. Less than 12 bucks. I can't wait to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Used to get take out all the time but no more this time was my last. We ordered the crispy beef as part of our families order which was always done well nice strips of lightly floured crispy beef but not this time, the beef was chewy little overly breaded chunks. After our family tried 1 piece each we stopped eating it. After dinner I returned to tropical with the uneaten crispy beef and told the man that the beef was terrible I stated I would like my money back and asked him what happened to the way the beef used to be done he told me that's the way it always is and offered me shrimp. We had already eaten and I wasn't interested in shrimp he said that we already ate lot of the beef, we only had four tiny pathetic pieces. One of the owners a woman came out from the kitchen who recognized me as a frequent customer and after explaining to her what the situation was she spoke in another language to the man and they offered me $4 when the beef cost $10 and was virtually untouched. I told them that this was unacceptable but they weren't budging so I took the $4 and told them that this was the last they would see of me. Now the first review they have on TripAdvisor is a bad one and they got another one on Yelp I hope cutting corners and not valuing customer satisfaction is working for them. Would definitely not recommend run from this place go to Jatujak down the street for much better Thai rather than this wannabe Thai, Adios amigos!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in man years but used to come frequently. What I recall is the Crispy Beef being absolutely divine. Honestly that dish would be on my list for potential last meals. Also I remember them having a delicious coconut milkshake. Great place!"}
{"text":"It's pretty unbeatable on price I'll give them that, but the food seems to just taste all the same. I've ordered a half a dozen different dishes and I swear it's just taken from the same pot. Their ingredients are pretty low quality. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I should have known when I entered this place not to eat here. It looked run down and a bit dirty. I ordered the Mango Chicken and Emerald Curry for take out. The Mango Chicken was edible but the Emerald Curry was just disgusting. The chicken was mushy and the broth of the curry had a horrible taste. Tasted like it was rotten. I would not recommend this place, nor come here ever again."}
{"text":"Have been ordering delivery for years. Consistent quality and fast delivery. Friendly customer service. Easy to order over the telephone. Steamed dumplings are one of my faves.  Tons of leftovers."}
{"text":"Great thai take-out place in the beaches area. Food is fresh, non-greasy and so cheap! The food is delicious and pretty authentic."}
{"text":"We ordered last night and while delivery was quick that's pretty much the best thing I can say. I ordered the spicy noodles and a mango salad. The mango was nice and ripe but the salad itself was pretty lacklustre. The spicy noodles were unfortunately some of the worst I've had. The noodles were only steamed and packed and them the stir-fried meat and veg were dumped on top. The chicken had the texture of very processed fast food meat and, while this may be something that's just a problem for me because I hate it, in addition to bell peppers they used celery in the stir-fry. Yuck. Nope.   I really wanted to like this."}
{"text":"Love having excellent Thai Food in my neighborhood.  Crispy Beef is hauntingly good. Solid Singapore Noodles, Spring Rolls, and Mango Salad. Good soups and Pad Thai too.  Dining Room iz adequate, its not opulent, but does the trick. Quick Delivery too."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Always great food and well priced! Interior could use some updating. Mmmm Green Curry Beef."}
{"text":"Bad Chinese food disguised as Thai food.  Most dishes were deep fried, High in MSG/sodium - not real Thai at all"}
{"text":"Amazing food and so cheap, I went almost every week when I was at Neil McNeil, definitely going back whenever I'm in the area. Don't let the restaurant's appearance fool you, the food is great"}
{"text":"Ok, listen! Order the Pad Thai!!!  We're talking under 8 bucks for a very large order which will more than feed you and your buddy's belly.  Now, would I eat in? Probs not.  Do the delivery or pick-up.  Also - remember to ask for their specials... Often you'll get 2 spring rolls added to your order for only a dollar."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 takeout dishes; classic pad Thai, green vegetable curry, beef fried rice and chicken with peanut sauce. Everything except the beef fried rice was delicious with tons of fresh vegetables and the sauces were very tasty. They were about 20 minutes late with the order, however it was valentines day and it was packed."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese restaurant in the neighbourhood. They have great lunch specials that never disappoint. Their Thai food is okay too but I wouldn't recommend it. They have plenty of other dishes that are amazing."}
{"text":"If you like generic Asian food, then this is a pretty good place. However, for a Thai restaurant, the flavour profiles of Thai cuisine is almost non-existent. We ordered lemongrass soup, and it is very typical watered down Asian soup with only a hint of lemongrass. The pad thai was overly sweet and the tropical fried rice is on the bland side. Nevertheless, the ingredients were exceptionally fresh. The service is average, nothing terrible but not good either. If you dine in, the wait times are higher than normal because they prioritize takeout and delivery and you have to wait until their food is cooked before it's your turn. Overall, good restaurant for typical Asian food, but mediocre for Thai food."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple of times hoping it would be better.  Found the green curry thin and a bit bland. Pad Thai was ok, but not great.  The spring rolls are huge though and pretty good.  2.5/5"}
{"text":"Great food, packing is good. Service is nice. I will always come back for more and I can always guarantee the food is good. The only problem I really hate is they never give you cutlery. But even so, there food is always guaranteed to be good! Oh, and they only do delivery after 5:30pm unfortunately, also no debit machine which sucks. I would say its safe to give them your credit number though if you want to pay using credit."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years especially during my high school days down the road. I always come back when I have a craving for pad Thai!"}
