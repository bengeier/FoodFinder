{"text":"Great cozy little snack shack, try the tofu obviously and the popcorn chicken.  If anyone remembers the long lineups for tofu at the night markets near pmall and metro every summer, then you might like this place, as it is run by the same guy(s).   Be prepared for a small amount of seating, like I said, it's quite cozy. Their drink selection is also pretty nice for a place that doesn't look that big."}
{"text":"If you enjoy those Chinese/Taiwanese/Hong Kong Street Style snacks during different night markets during the summer, you should come to Taste of Asia.  The inside is really really small, enough seating for 4 people or so. But you might not even want to stay inside as you might smell like Stinky Tofu after. My Yelp Friend was standing right across the plaza waiting for me to eat my snack as he didn't want to be smelly.  There are also other food options but they are mostly snack food at least for their soft opening today. I ended up having the Spicy Beef Balls ($7) and some stranger next to me let me tried a piece of their stinky tofu (so very kind of them, as I was looking at them with my puppy's eyes...)  Food definitely on the pricier side. The Stinky Tofu ended up not as stinky as the one that I ate at Night Market... There are though other things I would like to try on their menu which is written on the chalkboard with no pricing!!!  At least eating the snack at Taste of Asia doesn't involves lining up or fighting with the crowds at various Night Markets..."}
{"text":"Went there on the weekend for some dinner for take out. Unfortunately the stinky tofu didnt come with any pickled vegetables which in my opinion is what makes taiwanese style stinky tofu taste so much better. The curry fish balls were a disappointment as they were kind of tasteless on the inside. Maybe we went too late and they had to make a fresh batch? The sweet not spicy was very delicious and id go there just for that any day. Overall unique little place for some street food."}
