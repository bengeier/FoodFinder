{"text":"It's not that this place is bad, but it's not great either. The waitress who served us was great and extremely helpful and attentive. It's just that the food was not spectacular. Would I come here again? Maybe, if there was nothing else available; but it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Good but not wow. I'm happy I had a tuango coupon otherwise it would have been way to much for the food eaten. My suggestion is only go there if you have a tuango or groupon type coupon."}
{"text":"Meh - wasn't terrible but wasn't great either, maybe they were having an off night. We were a  group of 8   I haven't really asked any of my dining companions about how their dinner was but I didn't hear any real complaints  I had the table d'h√¥te which came with a salad and dessert and coffee.   The salad if I remember correctly was an endive and apple concoction - tasty but very over dressed and my portion was smaller than that of my dining companions.   For the main I ordered mussels - they usually come with marinara sauce but I asked if they had any other choices and was told I could have it with wine sauce. While they were not under or over cooked,  half of the mussels were broken and the sauce was very bland and loaded with herbs (not good for dunking) - was there wine in there? I couldn't taste it - very watery.   I had creme caramel for dessert - it was ok.  The waitress was friendly but her helper/busboy/greeter was not at all (crack a smile dude you'll get better tips). It wasn't crazy busy either another table of 8 and maybe two or three tables of 2.  No plans to go back."}
{"text":"I recently went here to celebrate with my girlfriend. I'm a little torn trying to review this place because I really did enjoy myself, but at the end of the day I still feel like I spent too much (even with the Groupon) for what was more of an average experience.  The food was pretty good, but not excellent like you'd expect at the price point. I had a five course meal of my choosing: cream of spinach soup, followed by flambeed shrimp and scallop, then a frozen pear soaked in syrup and vodka, with the surf and turf - filet mignon and scampis - for the main entree and a half baked chocolate cake for desert.   The highlights were the scampi and the cake. The scampi were big and very delicious with a tangy butter and cheese dipping sauce. The cake came out piping hot and was rich and moist.  Overall my meal wasn't bad, but for the cost there's definitely better elsewhere."}
