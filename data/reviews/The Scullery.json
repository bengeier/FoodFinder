{"text":"Great coffee, cool staff and lovely design and the brunch has all the classic dishes plus a few fun ones"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Saturday. Got the french toast which was great but the service not so much. The service started off well with our server sitting us and getting our food and drinks order in promptly. After this they basically stopped serving us which was odd as the place wasn't full. The plates were left well after the meal was finished and only cleared once we called the server over.  Will give 2 stars as the food was good, could easily have been 3 or 4 with some slightly improved service."}
{"text":"Their americanos are delicious! The lunch wraps are fine, nothing to brag about, but their coffee is delicious! Haven't tried their breakfasts yet."}
{"text":"Been to the Scullery a good number of times for coffee. There drinks are good. The Staff are not very friendly. Theres only one lady I know that smiles when we walk in and seems happy to see us but almost everyone else seems a little uninterested."}
{"text":"The Scullery makes the best chocolate chip cookies ever! Mmmm! Great ginger cookies, too! The major problem here, though, is that they do not make enough of the most amazing things and make too many of those that don't sell as well. They do sell day-olds for less, which is great (the jerk chicken sandwiches go for $3.50 the next day and taste just as good), but they really just need to bake more chocolate chip cookies.  As for the rest of the food, other than the sandwiches, it's overpriced and overpowering in flavour... too much tarragon in some of the salads, for example. I like odd spices and mixed flavours a lot, but even for me, they overdo it in the salads here. On the other hand, the soups are great.  The Scullery's fresh pressed grapefruit juice is delicious, and they make authentic flat whites and lattes with cute heart-shaped latte art designs on top. The coffee is the perfect strength and tastes great. The tea selection is great, as well, but you need to be really careful because even if you add five ice cubes from your own freezer, it remains way too hot to sip on right away (not just me - everyone in our office who has tried the tea continues to have this issue). On the other hand, the coffee is sometimes not hot enough. These awkward temperatures aren't dependent on who makes the drinks, so it may just be a machine issue. The staff members are generally friendly and quick to assist and are great conversationalists, as well.  There's free Wi-Fi, and I also hear it's a great place to go for brunch, although for me, The Scullery is located near my office and is simply an easy place to grab a real coffee when I'm tired of the ones from our Keurig."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this small and quaint cafe on a Sunday morning. There's more to the casual decor that appears on the surface. Once sat down and was able to appreciate the details they have put into this place. The breakfast was very good and the coffee was superb. Friendly staff and a really welcoming place overall. Definitely will try to \"stumble\" on this lovely place again in the future."}
{"text":"Went here on a friend's recommendation for breakfast and really enjoyed it. The cool colours gave the place a fresh and exotic feeling.   Went around 9am and had the eggs Benedict. It was very yummy! It wasn't too crowded and there was a combination of dine in and take out."}
{"text":"Delicious smoky rich Americanos, delightful baked goods and tasty brunches. Staff are great and friendly. Always happy with food, drinks and ambience. Love the decor"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood, but I only decided to give this place a try recently for a Saturday brunch. The food (Eggs Benedict) was delicious. Unfortunately, as I was passing by the place the other day, I've noticed a sign saying they stopped serving brunch. Too bad."}
{"text":"The coffee and some of the deserts are quite good.  The sandwhich bread is too tough to eat and salads can be hit and miss.  I'll go back for the coffee for sure though."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, however the prices are a little high, especially considering the wrap I had was awful (genuinely disgusting - soggy and completely unseasoned). The baked goods looked good, and that may be their strong suite - I didn't try them. All in all $12.43 for a terrible wrap and a decent fresh juice. The staff are certainly a little cold. If I'm ever back it will only be to try the coffee and baked goods."}
{"text":"The beans, from Pilot, are rich and fresh. Espresso is excellent. Brunch is fine but nothing special - the real thought and attention seems to go into the salads, pastries, etc. A tiny bit pricey given portion size but the food is real and good. Best at non-brunch hours. Kind people."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch. Ordered the hammingway eggs benny and the Irish breakfast.  the eggs were poachers inconsistently, one was overdone in each meal. I also found that the English muffin was a bit too hard.    However I enjoyed the meal overall, it was beautifully presented and included everything I like about an eggs benny. The staff were awesome and attentive, offered to top up the hot water for my tea without me having to ask.   I would come again."}
{"text":"Lovely coffee shop in Cabbagetown.  I've walked by a couple of times but finally went in for an afternoon.  Lovely interiors and great coffee + food.  I ordered a flat white, ginger cookie and pork shoulder sandwich.  All were delicious and the sandwich came arranged artfully with a tossed salad.  Great taste, quality and value for all the food.  Talked with Laura, the co-owner, and she was very friendly, as was the other staff member who served me.  Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"It was a very nice cafe. It was a little bit far from Yonge Street to walk. There are not many things to look around the Scullery, but it is worth of going to the Scullery. Their baked items are very good. I tried oat and butter milk muffin and it was very good. Coffee was good, too. It was very bright comfortable cafe. There were nice tables and chairs. The Scullery was British atmosphere. This place seems to be a social place and women are chatting with their friends, so it was not the place to bring a computer to work on a project."}
{"text":"A cozy eatery in the heart of Cabbagetown.   I love going for weekend breakfast - suggest having the eggs benedict or a selection of scones and tea.     I also love to stop by on my way home to pick up some brownies.  Recently tried the new banana cupcake - I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent food and coffee coming from a great owner. She is amazing and is very helpful and experienced.  I love all the homemade scones and jam. Just mouth watering and super delicious on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great coffee. Hidden gem for sure. Coming here on Sundays really make me feel rested for sure.   Best Eggs Benedict in the city."}
{"text":"Fresh baked goods. Ok coffee. Freshly squeezed OJ. Sandwiches, soups and chilli with brunch options as well. Not always the friendliest servers. The baked goods are generous and tasty. Cute spot. Hopefully, the Kielburger brothers will sell all of their properties in the area so that it can invite other businesses like the Scullery and the Irv into the area."}
{"text":"Busy busy this morning! I've been going here regularly since it opened a year or two ago. It seems to have a nice established customer base of people who live and work in the neighborhood. I love supporting local business and this place is both super cute and has tasty treats.  My go to, well maybe lets call it what it is, my addiction is the ginger scones. we are talking butter and candied ginger with coarse sugar on top... melts in your mouth to be sure. They are always good but a little inconsistent, its clear its not always the same person baking them and I like it when they are a little browner rather than underdone. (you can tell i have had a number of them....) i always say i don't even like scones but these are amazing. clearly i could go on. the chocolate chip cookies are good as well. And the coffee is also good, not my favorite beans but a solid coffee, both the drip and the espresso.  The prices seem a bit high, the scone is $3.00 and a latte $4.00. But again i like to support local businesses that use fresh ingredients and make quality food. and most of the barista's are AWESOME... one, well... if you work in customer service part of your job is to smile and remember your regulars. Just saying as someone who has done this kind of work. :)   The Sunday brunch is awesome, i have had a few things and they were all super tasty. Overall i would highly recommend this place for the food and coffee."}
{"text":"I came here before my CPR course for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised. I had a delicious sandwich and The interior is very clean and fresh and has nice window seating to go have a coffee and read the paper"}
{"text":"Really quaint breakfast/brunch spot on the corner of Ontario Street. I don't think there's anything comparable in the neighbourhood. They have a fairly uncomplicated food and beverage menu that is reasonably priced. They do the eggs Benny very well and I would definitely recommend it. It's a small space and it fills up quite easily. Service was friendly and quick, and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Make the trip our here for my favorite Americano and a bag of beans to take away all the time. Brunch is always on point. My favourite is the Irish Breakfast!!!! The use Pilot beans which is one of my favorite local roasters."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and really enjoyed the service and atmosphere. Great interior design. The food was simple, but tasty. I had had the kale salad and lentil \"loaf\". The loaf resembled a large muffin, but was quite pricey at nine bucks. I really hope the food prices level out over time."}
{"text":"My wife and I took out two sons there for a late brunch. Our kids are still babies, and the staff were very accommodating with our 2-kid stroller. My wife is pretty much vegan (with some exceptions) and the kitchen added feta to the dish she specified was to be vegan, and they corrected the problem right away while giving her a cookie to nibble while she waited. I had the BLT which came with a side of greens and potatoes. I wish the serving had been a little larger (maybe even more potatoes), but everything I had was really tasty. The staff were all very friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"$5.25 for a triple americano (that's a DOLLAR FIFTY for ONE extra shot), that tastes like it was brewed with Tim Horton's coffee beans.  Never again."}
{"text":"I'd like to say I had ordered and enjoyed the tasty food but I can't. We ordered through Foodora and the order was cancelled. The excuse was that they didn't have an item we ordered. The delivery service said The Scullery is known to do this often. This has never happened to us with Just-Eat or Foodora restaurants before; it they don't have it, they phone and offer a substitution. It doesn't happen right away, either: we had to wait. It doesn't inspire me to go there in person."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a light, fresh brunch. They have a wide variety of menu options, including plenty of veggie friendly options. must haves include their breakfastvtacos and chocolate croissants. If you are dropping in just for a treat or coffee their scones are delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I've been hunting for good scones in Toronto since I moved here 4 years ago and I've finally found a place where the scones are crispy on the outside, flaky on the inside, and not overly sweet.   Came here for Sunday brunch and really appreciated that there was no lineup at all. We were seated quickly. My boyfriend and I had the scones to start, which were served with clotted cream and jam (thank god for a place in Toronto that doesn't serve scones with butter - it's just not right!). I had a mimosa with the eggs Hemingway and my boyfriend, the breakfast tacos and a cocktail made with pear juice and rum (forgot what it was called). The brunch food was seriously decent for the price (~$12) and I'm glad none of the food was greasy, as with many other similarly moderate priced brunch places.  However, I do see what other reviewers complained about regarding service. Indeed the staff that served us seemed quite pissed off at the world. She wasn't rude or anything, but she didn't look happy to be working AT ALL.  Regardless, I am looking forward to come back for the scones. I'm already salivating."}
{"text":"Expérience décevante: mauvais accueil, service très ordinaire (commande perdue), réputation surfaite, nourriture correcte mais sans plus... Il existe un bien meilleur choix dans le voisinage."}
{"text":"I've been curious as to what the place would be like since the \"unveiling\" countdown on the street corner. From the inside, this looks like a better place to be a coffee drinker that wants to sit and chill and have a snack than someone on the lunch time food hunt as I was, so please take my review with a grain of salt if you're on the prior instead of the latter.  My story is while walking by I saw a board saying $7 sandwiches in the window so stopped in. Seems the menu changes daily, but was literally only 2 options including barbecue pulled turkey w/ cole slaw, and a veggie option which I didn't even bother to read.  Received what seemed to be a pre-prepped and packaged (rather cutely with a little string around the wax paper) 4\" multigrain ciabatta bun with pulled turkey and a topping of coleslaw, and an accompanying little box containing additional coleslaw. The bun was so grainy that it took away from whatever flavour their was from the under-meat-filled middle contents of the sandwich. I really prefer to taste the filling than the bun when eating a sandwich. Coleslaw was perfectly passable but not impressive.   Although it was a small meal, for under $8 after tax I guess its not really unreasonable to ask so I'll give it a 3 star since I am willing to try it again, hopefully better results with another one of their sandwich options since another poster had such good results with their jerk chicken."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, the decor is beautiful. My friend and I got the Chai Tea Latte and regular Latte and both were delicious.  The woman who served us was also very sweet/nice to talk to :). We only got drinks and a feta-spinach pastry which was okay, only downfall is they wouldn't (or said they couldn't) heat it up so it was a little cold/dry.   Overall a great place with a lovely aura. Definitely would recommend and go back again (we want to try their main dishes!)"}
{"text":"I've passed by the Scullery many times but I finally decided to try it out for Saturday brunch. I ordered the eggs benny with salmon and a side of potatoes and salad. I also had a coffee that comes from Pilot roasters. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly, hollandaise on point and the salad was a good counter to the heaviness of the rest of the dish. One of the best brunches in the neighbourhood ($12 + $3 coffee). They also have scones with Devonshire cream so definitely coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This hipster cafe in Cabagetown is a little hidden gem with great breakfasts. The eggs Benedict is great with amazing hollandaise sauce and mixed greens. They serve coffee from the local coffee roaster Pilot. They also have great scones and small deserts. Space in this small coffee shop is limited so expect to wait to get seated."}
{"text":"A nice little spot for some breakfast. Service is friendly, maybe a bit slow, but pleasant if you're not in a huge rush. Try the scones."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Great corner spot, the place is clean, warm feeling.  Flat white as good as I've ever had.  Muffin great tasting."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for the newest brunch spot in cabbagetown and the scullery partially lived up to expectations... There is room for improvement however it's a spot that cabbagsters will no doubt support cause its local and expensive...the formula for success it seems around here these days.   First the good  Great service with a smile - very nice people and I wish them nothing but success. The place itself is really nice too. You can tell that some money and thought was put into the layout and design.  Really bright and clean. Beautiful spot.  Great job.   So I got the Blt which at $11.50 comes with a salad and a pickle apparently but I never got a pickle...so maybe not. This is a $6.50 Blt at best especially in light of the local competition. Not impressive at all... I sure hope the egg dishes are better...they would kinda have to be. There is also lots of poppy seeds on everything and I mean lots; tons in fact.  Now I actually didn't mind that but I can see others not liking it. It's not that it was a bad Blt it was just really disappointing given the price tag. Not sure how they came up with that price - might be worth a look folks. Coffee was good - with refills.   So there is some good and also some stuff to improve on here but definitely worth a second try in the future - just bring a toothpick!  Hoping to up this to 4 stars if the next food item I try can live up to the price!"}
{"text":"Brunch is no longer offered at this establishment. The lunch menu may be good, but haven't tried it.  Sad to see a cool local joint shift over business needs. Really enjoyed coming here on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  we split the scone special which was amazing and the I had the eggs florentine which was also amazing.  Boyfriend had the eggs Hemingway which he loved. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Favourite coffee shop in Cabbagetown. Adore the coffee, drinks, healthy and delicious salads and sandwiches....and the assortment of pastries.   Oh, and did I mention the owners and staff couldn't be lovelier?   Design nerds: you will appreciate the tiled counter and the reclaimed wood bar. And the colour palette :)"}
{"text":"A++! Lovely, friendly baristas, tasty pastries, great espresso, and nice simple brunches. I adore this place and I am so glad it found its home in Cabbagetown."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite coffee shop to work in. It's a bonus that it is in my area. They have great coffee with Pilot beans and all the baristas can make a quality cup. It is a nice place to work on weekdays in the afternoon. It is quiet, they have power outlets and you can use the washroom without fearing that someone will steal your laptop. I also tried brunch one weekend and enjoyed it. Eggs are definitely the main star of the menu. I tried the Eggs Florentine and it was great."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch. Best scones ever- flaky and perfectly baked with a nice cream and jam on the side. Blt is a winner. Add avocado for a nice creamy finish. Coffee was strong and black just like it should be. Will be a regular brunch spot when we come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches and salads you'll get in Cabbagetown -- or for a few kilometres in all directions, really. It gets busy, but it's worth the wait. Decent coffee in the mornings means you might be tempted to stop here more than once in a day if you live or work nearby."}
{"text":"Initially when I came here two years ago, I gave the scullery a five star rating. It was perfection. Unfortunately, it is not the same place now. I've been twice since then and the food and service have gone downhill. At my last visit, the service staff made us feel as if every request was an inconvenience - even being seated for brunch. The restaurant was clearly too busy for the service staff working. Food was subpar. I had scrambed eggs which was a very small portion. The potatoes were barely edible as they had way too much thyme added. The side salad was so bland. Even the toast was soggy! I find it quite overpriced as well. They used to bring your bill in a little cinnamon tin which was so adorable but they do not do that anymore apparently. I will not be returning and I will be looking for a new brunch place."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic scones. However, they do get sold out on weekends and the cafe never pick up their phone so you won't know until you have made the trip down."}
{"text":"This is a quiet little brunch place that I always walk by.  I have been here before for coffee but have not tired their brunch until recently.  I like the decor of this place nice and bright - perfect for brunch.  I find their menu for brunch is good and prices are en par with other brunch places in the area.  The portions are just right.  Their scones are a must try! Too bad they don't have outside seating for brunch, especially for warm weather because they aren't on the busy end of Carlton.  There coffee,  I think it is an Ethiopian bean because it has an acidic taste to it but it is not too over powering like the Tanzania coffee beans,  which I found too acidic for my taste buds.  Overall,  really like this place!!"}
{"text":"The Scullery is a lovely new cafe that opened up in the Cabbagetown 'hood just 2 days ago. It was formerly a Japanese restaurant, but you'd never know it. They've given the space a complete makeover with everything decked out in girly purple and white. It caught my eye and made me want to stop by and try it. When you enter, you'll find art on the walls and information about purchasing. It feels like a little gallery. There are clusters of tables for 2-4 and then a larger corner table at the back, perfect for groups. Everything is very home-y with an attention to detail -- fresh flowers, white rustic chairs with one leg painted blue, beautifully written chalkboard menus.   I just had a flat white while I sat and read. My flat white was just okay -- could have been hotter. But I lucked out, this being opening weekend, they were trying out foods and I got a free savoury biscuit as I was sitting there. It was cheesy and delicious. They serve lunch and brunch, with soups, salads, sandwiches, and a daily entree. They said there will always be vegatarian and gluten-free options. Food prices look reasonable ($6-12).   I didn't check if  they have wifi, although it strikes me as a more social type of cafe rather than a place to camp out with a laptop. That said, I didn't feel weird reading there alone. Very peaceful vibe. Hope to go back soon to sample their food options."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on Sunday and ordered Eggs Benny with bacon...it was good and the place itself is cute and charming.  In my opinion the menu was quite limited in terms of food but the latte I had was pretty good.  The   Wouldn't go out of my way to go back though."}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place and had very good service here. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. The cappuccinos were great and the server even ordered a special drink for us with the amount of milk we wanted. The food was awesome. I had the coconut waffles which were amazing. Definitely one of my favourite brunch places in the city, wish brunch was every day here!"}
{"text":"There were a few small groups waiting to be seated when we arrived, so I was glad that I had used the online booking system on Yelp to secure a table (we were seated almost immediately after giving our names).  The server came by to ask if we'd like a drink so I asked if they had a drink menu.  She then proceeded to recite their drink list - but in a very general way.  I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem, but I like to see a full list of drinks before making a selection and not feel rushed or obligated to try to memorize a bunch of things so I wasn't thrilled when this went down. How am I supposed to know that I want a pint of Conductors and not a Caesar if I don't know that you serve Conductor's?   I asked nicely if she had a menu that I could read. The server looks straight in my face and does a fake friendly smile in a \"I'm losing my patience with you\" type of voice and says, \"that's what I'm trying to tell you... the list of drinks we have\".   3 stars because food was solid."}
{"text":"tiny little shop. not good for big groups. probably like 25 person capacity.  i had the eggs hemingway which had a salad, smoked salmon, 2 poached eggs, roasted taters, and a thin orange slice and thin cantaloupe slice.  eggs were perfectly runny. i have no complaints about the egg hemingway other than the fact that i wanted more of it. in all fairness though, i showed up for lunch around 1pm ish and had nothing to eat all day up to that point."}
