{"text":"Ordered a club sandwich and fries, and my expectations were exceeded. Everything was very fresh, and prepared with a lot of care. Staff were excellent. I will be going back !"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this place but their breakfast sandwich was excellent. The bacon was crispy, egg was cooked perfectly, and the English muffin was fluffy and fresh (a lot of places have dry English muffins). It looked and tasted delicious. Their brewed coffee also tasted like what you want brewed coffee to taste like. Hope I have another excuse to be in the area, I'd like to go back. Their salads looked pretty good also, I was eyeing one with goat cheese."}

{"text":"Easily a 5.  Great, tasty, healthy options in very good portion sizes.  This is a very neat, clean facility playing enjoyable Canadian songwriters' radio over lunch.  Farmhouse Salad is really interesting and is a generous portion size.  Their mission is to support those with special needs in employment to top it off.  Easy access near Calgary Airport as well."}
{"text":"So where can I start this place drew me there because when I looked on yelp for a breakfast place close to home it popped up five stars it also had a check and special of $10 off your first visit. When I realized where it was located, in airways strip mall I thought can't be all that great, until I was greeted by the great staff.   The menu is quaint not overwhelming, and prices are pretty good. I ordered banana bread French toast only because manager Jessie had explained menu items and that everything is made in house including salted caramel sauce so I was sold! Hubby had traditional breakfast with ham and potatoes were herbed tater tots!  Ambiance was great new look very clean bathrooms and artwork at all the booths, then our breakfast came!!! WOW The portion was huge, my French toast amazing not overly sweet, hubby loved his taters, and ham and we ordered bacon too it was good! Coffee was great too! When we were eating they checked on us a few times to make sure everything was good and we were happy!!  When we were leaving my hubby met Bill who is the managing director?? But very nice guy, informative and told us about up coming additions,and about helping support people with disabilities, by either hiring them for different positions and by displaying the beautiful artwork! We will definitely be back again!! Love it there Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"10 stars out of 5, my daughter says. The staff is friendly and helpful. The decor is warm and inviting. The food was really, really good.  We had the million dollar sandwich and shared a hungry breakfast. Everything was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The French toast was filled will real bananas. The tater tots were crunchy and addictive. Even the bacon stood out for its taste.  Don't be scared off by the low number of reviews, this place just opened but is destined to become a favorite."}
