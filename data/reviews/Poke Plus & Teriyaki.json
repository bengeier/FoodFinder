{"text":"Glad a poke place had finally made it to State Street! I had half greens and half brown rice with a build your own. Greens leave little to be desired, skip 'em unless you like iceberg lettuce.  Price point is about right for a poke place, but maybe a little expensive considering other nearby options (~13 for a large, BYO). I had salmon, poke salmon, and poke tuna. Fish tasted fresh and toppings were plenty! I appreciated that they offered tobiko as well.  Sauces were solid, I had poke sauce and spicy mayo, neither of which overpowered the bowl. It was a solid combo that was savory and so so so filling.  Service was fast, seating is limited, so be prepared to take your meal on the go if many people are around. I'm excited to come back and eat more poke!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced for poke. You most definitely get what you pay for! The salmon and tuna just melt in your mouth. You can combine as many sauces as you like, and each one is very flavorful in its own way. Selection of toppings is amazing as well! Everything is delicious and adds much more flavor and excitement to your bowl. Very friendly staff and comfortable seating setup. Highly recommend to stop in and enjoy a poke bowl here!"}
{"text":"I'm so down for the explosion of poke places in Madison, Wisconsin. I was in Hawaii last summer and literally still dream about the abundance of fresh, buttery, flavorful poke that you could find there pretty much any place you went. I've not yet made it out to other poke places in Madison but if they're anything like Poke Plus, I'd say Madison is in pretty good poke hands.   This location replaces the old Disco Fries restaurant, which I never entered but walked by every day and was not surprised to see go under because I hardly ever saw anyone in there. I think the location works much better as a poke place - it's a quick light lunch you can grab to go and the service is quick and efficient. The fish is fresh and the sauces are yummy - probably the only qualm is portions are a bit small for what you pay but it is poke so I'm happy to pay it. I also got their salmon teriyaki too go one day and it was very satisfying - a surprising amount of fish and very flavorful. Definitely will add Poke Plus into my rotation of \"i'm on campus and want to have lunch but don't want to eat at the Union\" places."}
{"text":"Great taste! A lot of protein! So a lot of different colored food materials! I'll certainly come back again!"}
{"text":"Tried a sample when I was walking State Street about a week ago. 2 sweet gals were giving samples out front. It was awesome! Going back today so I can get an entire bowl. Flavor was off the charts and tuna just melted in my mouth. Update: even better than expected. Everything is in front of you. You just tell them what you want in it. It's like a dissected sushi roll"}
{"text":"pretty lit, way better than the fries place that was there before.   it's kind of like a qdoba style restaurant but instead of making a burrito bowl you're making a sushi bowl. some of the toppings cost a bit extra but not a ton. the sizes might look small but it surprisingly fills you up pretty well. the quality is pretty good and the fish tastes fresh.   it's pretty small and has limited seating, the couple times i went it seemed pretty popular but we were able to find seats.   i don't know why so many poke places are opening up in madison lately, but so far i like this one the best. it also has a pretty convenient location!"}
{"text":"The food there is really awesome and so fresh! I do love the poke salmon and poke tuna which make me crazy. The price is not high while the food does exceed my expectation a lot! Now it is my favorite food on State st!"}
{"text":"Very good quality fish. I got the salmon poke and it just melts in your mouth. They have a good variety of seafood and vegetables."}
{"text":"Great food, I like it. Everything fresh and nicely made. Service is good. Best restaurant on State street. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Ok. First I am not sure if the other reviewers have actually had authentic poke...but it is not 5 stars...now don't get me wrong it is not bad...but it is not 5 stars. Quality and ingredients are all fine, but the flavor profile of the true tuna poke is lacking. This restaurant for what it is, fast and easy poke is fine, and the value is good, but if you are expecting exceptional (eg 5 star) poke that it is not."}
{"text":"YUM! Just went here for opening day and I absolutely love Poké Plus.  Although it's slightly pricey ($9 for a small, and prices go up from there), I'd say that's to be expected from quality poké places.  I ordered the medium (regular) which was the perfect size, and I loved the customizable options-you can get everything from mango to Kani salad, which are extra but still great options.  I really liked how you could choose multiple protein options for no extra charge; you get 3 choices with the medium, and I chose the spicy salmon, regular salmon, and the poké tuna.  All the options were so fresh and delicious, and so were the sauces.  I wish I had gotten a bit more of the spicy mayo on top because it was so good!  Also, I would definitely recommend getting the tempura crunch to top it off-it's like you're eating a shrimp tempura roll in a bowl (SO good.) All in all, will definitely be going back for a delicious lunch-it's about time we got a poké place on state!"}
{"text":"Definitely the most delicious place on State St!!!!!! Love it!!!! I ordered a large bowl with 3 scoops of proteins, which are a lot more than any other poke bowl places in Madison. I had the poke salmon, poke tuna and baby octopus! Everything is so fresh and tasty! Definitely will be going back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to State Street.  Overall the restaurant is inviting with clear signs directing you where to order.  They offer the poke bowls in three sizes.  I ordered a large which is actually the middle size offered.  After selecting your rice you get an unlimited choice of veggies although there is a surcharge for a few options.  I was also impressed that I was allowed to pick up to three proteins.  I selected the salmon, ahi tuna, and poke tuna.  They also offer a lot of sauces to finish off our bowl.  I selected the sesame sauce and poke sauce.  The menu above also describes what goes in each sauce.  The final product is very tasty, fresh, and colorful.  Overall the employees are very friendly and answer any questions that you may have.  The interior space is a little small so you might end up sharing a spot at a big communal table with others.  I plan to come back and give their teriyaki a shot.  I highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Another great Poke spot in Madison. As a vegetarian I was really pleased with all the options. When the waitress heard I was a vegetarian and just wanted tofu, they gave me some extra vegetables to round off my bowl. I left plump and pleased."}
{"text":"We've been at this place for dinner, but it's probably rather made for a lunch visit. The food is pretty good but quite overprized, especially the Teriyaki bowls. One very negative point: The girl of the staff is really really unfriendly, a reason for us not to come back."}
{"text":"Got the regular size. Amazing veggies and were super fresh. Spicy tuna plus poke tuna...fish tasted so fresh. Couldn't believe the portion size. We are from Milwaukee and this kicked Fresh Fin's butt!"}
{"text":"Huge DIY Poke Bowl   The base is white rice, brown rice, mix green or half and half. You could choose different proteins for different prices. Choose as many as free basic toppings. Regular - $8.99 (2P) Large $11.99 (3P) and Super $14.99 (5P). Some toppings such as avocado and seaweed salad cost extra $0.5.  You could choose from various sauces such as Poke, ginger Dressing, sesame dressing, spicy Mayo and so on. I added the Garnishes Tempura Crunch and dried seaweed. Like both! Really love DIY Oder processing. I choose all free topping besides the onion. Greedy girl!  This new poke restraint is more close to Chinese flavor. Highly recommend! A healthy choice for the summer season!"}
