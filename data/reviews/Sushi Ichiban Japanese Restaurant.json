{"text":"We stopped after a long day of Christmas shopping. Great food! Super friendly staff! I like the booths too.
We enjoyed the Spicy Tuna Cone, Ichiban Roll!"}
{"text":"There is much better sushi in the SW. Some of our rolls were a bit dried out, like they had been sitting in the fridge.

I had my first potato korokke at Sushi Ichiban. Take a pass on that one."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for all you could eat sushi, it was the worst experience I've had. First the selection is very small compared to many others just the basics really. Secondly my friend ordered a hand rolled cone and it was completely frozen! When she pointed this out to staff she was told to \"just set it to the side and let it thaw, eat it last\" like we would want to eat a frozen cone. That wasn't the only frozen item we had either 3 pieces of frozen toro were also served to us. The service was terrible, the \"fresh\" fish was frozen, and the selection was nearly non existent. Never again!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, fresh and hot foods were hot! Service was great and speedy, excellent selection. Clean environment, I had a plate that was a bit greasy and they exchanged it hassle-free. Price range was about $80 for 2 of us all you can eat with cola and bubble tea 2for1. Much better than MacLeod Trail Sushi, see my review on them from Nov. 28, 2014.
Go here, it's a sushi treasure!"}
{"text":"Bait & Switch - For some reason, actually no reason was given at all, this Sushi Ichiban, although they're affiliated w/the Macleod Trail Sushi Ichiban (in fact, same ownership), which is renowned for its AYCE, inexplicably is NOT AYCE! Significantly impacted our dining experience adversely."}
{"text":"OKAY!

I'll admit it, I recently went behind O Shima's back and tried Sushi Ichiban because of proximity, and a coupon.

It was okay, not bad, not great. Beef tataki was not good, some rolls were tasty but a bit higher price than I'm used to. 

Overall, I don't think I'd go again."}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant- always my go to! The fish is fresh and delicious. Hands down my favourite sushi in the city. 

My only issue is for the specialty rolls. I have ordered dynamite and scallop rolls here expecting to receive what I order but i am disappointed in them as they add crab as a filler and this isn't mentioned in the description. I hate California rolls and feel when they use this as a filler it ruins the traditional taste and you're not getting what you pay for.

The raw fish is amazing but I  hate the crab addition in the specialty rolls. I would recommend having the crab as an option (and to mention this in the description), because for people that do not like this or have an allergy this is an issue."}
{"text":"Pretty reasonable sushi, for a place that's pretty far off the map in terms of other asian restaurants. Service is reasonable - not brilliant, but not horrible. If you're jonesing for raw fish, pick this over the Safeway deli, anyways."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. Went there for the all you can eat shabu shabu and sushi. Worst service ever, took over 20 minutes to get a plate of beef that we had to ask for multiple times. Food quality was horrible. To top it off they added a 15% gratuity on top of our bill for a table of 5 adults and one child. What makes them think they're entitled to a tip with such bad service.  To top it off I got sick from the food that night as my stomach couldn't digest it. Do not go here. We would never go back."}
{"text":"I like sushi and for me, this place was just mediocre, as the fish wasn't the freshest - especially their unagi... and they were kind of slow coming out with the food.  It didn't make the experience enjoyable, as the food came out on little plates at a time.  And, with all the wait time in between, we got stuffed faster too.  Their desserts are quite good, but, I can't get past some of their fish not being the freshest.... even though the selection was pretty good and I could order other things next time."}
{"text":"The Sushi was OK for all you can eat. But not great. One of the pieces came with a hair on it. The fish itself was not bad. But not exactly the freshest either. I think I'll skip this place in the future and try some others."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi is actually pretty good, but they always seem to be running out of the good stuff like Toro, Unagi...etc. sometimes they will even tell you they have no more, but you can still see it being served to other tables. Last night for the 3rd time recently they ran out of Toro before we arrived. This time we found out before we actually ordered anything. When we got up to leave they still insisted on charging us $3.15 for tea we had not recieved or drank yet. I found this both insulting and petty. I of course paid it and left with my wife and 2 other couples. No apology either. This place has gone down hill. That was my last visit. Try some other places in town that actually serve what they promise."}
{"text":"Sushi Ichiban is hands down, the best AYCE sushi restaurant in the city of Calgary. Like most Sushi restaurants they offer a regular menu with great dishes like the \"Takoyaki\" and others. However, if you're hungry and willing to pay some serious cash, then AYCE menu is your savior. They have all kinds of sushi on their AYCE, especially the more expensive \"Ikura\" sushi. The price is fair when dealing with AYCE restaurants. The great thing about Sushi Ichiban is that the restaurant is large and can accommodate large groups of people. Sushi Ichiban is definitely an AYCE menu that everyone who is a Sushi Enthusiast must try."}
{"text":"I end up going to Sushi Ichiban almost every week!  The thing I like best about them is that since they are quite large there is almost never a wait to sit down, which is rare to say about a Sushi restaurant these days!

The staff is always friendly and the food comes out quickly once you order, so I would say overall, this is a great place to come and eat!

The only thing I would say to improve is to come out with some new rolls once and a while, I've tried everything on the menu by now and some more variety would be good!"}
{"text":"All I can say is we paid for all you can eat...canceled our orders halfway and left to go somewhere else. 

I mean there were some decent items but alot of time they were flavorless and poor quality. So if you want to just have a place to full yourself up, come here."}
{"text":"The servers are very fun!  
Sushi is great!  A little busy but that's always a good sign for a sushi joint I think!
They have a cool fish pond! With fish!
All in all great sushi for calgary."}
{"text":"If you want to stuff your face with decent all-you-can-eat sushi, go here. The pieces are fresh, sized well and service is decent. If you want to order specialty dishes or individual pieces, please go elsewhere.

We've dined here twice so far and the first time, we had all you can eat sushi. It was alright. The second time we went (last week, Friday evening), we asked for a menu and the experience was... forgettable.

What I will never forget, however, is the dirty booth they gave us. This is a booth where you are supposed to take your shoes off before you enter and sit down, but there was food all over the floor so we had to keep our shoes on. It was disgusting. There was also rice all over the seating area. The walls were also dirty inside the booth. Looked like they hadn't been scrubbed for at least 5 years.

We ordered Salmon & Tuna Don bowls, and they were tiny compared to what you would get elsewhere. The rice was too vinegary, and it was drowning in fish eggs. Too much for my taste.

I ordered tuna and salmon pieces. They kept falling off their little beds of rice, which was annoying.

Service was slow. They are so busy with All You Can Eat Customers that menu-ordering customers are left behind in the rush.

Also, there were groups of noisy teenagers. I did not like this."}
{"text":"Overall I am pretty pleased with my experience at Sushi Ichiban. The service was friendly and welcoming. I had the all you can eat sushi and for the price I am confidant that I got a good value! The selection was good and there was a decent variety of rolls. For an all you can eat scenario presentation wasn't bad either. Of course it wasn't fancy but you still didn't feel like you where in some kind of food factory with no care to each dish. Everything came fast but didn't feel pre-prepared in any way.  The beef tataki was only ok but very doable. The rolls were prepared well and certainly did not disappoint. The decor was a little dated but overall this was a good experience. If I go again I would like to try to order off of the menu to see the quality of dishes not on the all you can eat menu. 

As far as the all you can eat goes, you will not leave hungry or disappointed."}
{"text":"It's too bad the service is so terrible because the food is awesome.  Be crystal clear when ordering and get confirmation of your order and the price.  Then enjoy your delicious meal."}
{"text":"We used to come to this place for years. it's been a few years now, and this is not nearly what it was. The food was not fresh, i was very unimpressed.

I dont reccomend it."}
{"text":"Tonight, we ordered the first all you can eat, and waited 15 minutes. I asked several times when the food will arrive, but still no answer. After 20 minutes of ordering, we finally get some information which is, 'your order was not processed correctly'.

I think I had to leave at that moment.

They keep saying 'tonight is busy night, every customer is waiting', so my 2nd and 3rd order also didn't arrived on time. I understand food can be late in busy day, but their attitude was really not nice. I almost felt it was my fault from their reaction.

We were waiting and waiting and waiting... for 3rd order but it never came to us. After 20 minutes of 3rd order, we decided to leave, because when we asked to server, she said 'we don;t know. it is busy night'. 

Well, then have a busy night! Farewell!

I am sad because i have so many memories in this sushi restaurant since 2005. I visited here more than 50 times. My first out eating in Calgary. My first son's 1 year birthday, when mother-in-law came from Korea, and anytime when my wife wants to eat sushi, we go here.

Not anymore. 

We will try Kinzo, which we saw when we were back to home with sad, unsatisfied, unhappy mood in the car. I heard they don't have all you can eat, but would have better Service, than Sushi Ichiban. 


Pro: Still good sushi. lots of other foods, too.
Con: Service is horrible. It was bad before, but getting worse every year."}
{"text":"Decent food and very good service. We had the takoyaki balls, gyoza, spicy salmon sashimi, spider roll and outsider roll. The appies were really good (gyoza was amazingggg). The sushi rolls had lots of fish and very little rice but not the best I've had. 

Casual atmosphere and friendly staff so I would come back again."}
{"text":"Worst. Experience. Ever.

Went there last night, got told it would be a wait for a table. Got seated in about 10 minutes. In a totally empty section. WTH? Waitress came by and took our drink order (and got it wrong) and dropped off ginger and wasabi, but no order sheets. She came back with our drinks, and no order sheets a second time, and seemed annoyed that I asked for one. Finally got order sheets, filled them out quickly, but like other reviewers, they forgot some of our order. I'm usually pretty lax with missed stuff, cause I'm getting AYCE, but seriously. They missed the SAME thing on all 4 sheets. Oh. And they charged us for 4 drinks, when we only ordered 2. Mentioned this to the waitress and she seemed insulted that we challenged her. I didn't tip, and she called me out on that, which was the last straw. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I will keep this short. The value of their lunch specials is amazing and will keep me going back and back again. One of my friends has been going here for years and will agree with me. Being on Macleod makes it an easy stop and every time I pass it during lunch hours, I have to hold myself back. That says a lot!"}
{"text":"In the mood for sushi and also having to hit up a comic store my friend and I decided to try Sushi Ichiban. Walking in I noticed the décor was dated but still enjoyable. We got sat in a booth along the wall.

I think our server assumed we were having the \"all you can eat\" and didn't give us regular menus which was kind of disappointing because we actually only wanted to order a couple rolls to share and did not want to take part in the all you can eat special.
 
Once we got the regular menu we ordered a Kappa, Dynamite, California, Philadelphia, Spicy tuna and Avocado rolls. 

The rolls came out quite fast but I found them to have A LOT of rice. The flavour wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go and rave about them. 

For all those rolls + tea the bill was under $50 and I found that to be quite decently priced. 
Would I come here again? Probably not just because I think there is better out there to be tasted but it is worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Apparently the big draw for this resturant is the AYCE.  When we first pulled up their sign for AYCE was bigger than the sign for the resturant.

The buffet is $23 for Mon- Thurs and  $26 for the weekend.  Here's the kicker. It's half price for children 3-9 years old.  Do you know how much a 3 year old eats? like almost nothing.  That's a rip off.

The food was mediocre to ok but what really turned me off was the personal hygiene of the chefs.  The chefs are at the back of the resturant and you can see them from the tables if you are facing them.  One chef was rubbing and picking his nose while reading a magazine and the other was actually picking his teeth with a toothpick.  This is done between orders. Don't go there. If I could give a zero stars I would based on that alone."}
{"text":"whether it is miso soup, tempura rolls or All you can Eat, this is definately a place with good food and service."}
{"text":"A servicible, if a little dowdy, sushi joint. Traditional wood work, booths, and servers silk wraps. Quaint branded dishes and bowls. I have nothing against traditional, but this decor seemed a bit run down and musty. The food was good, however. Hot food was hot. Not a lot of imagination though."}
{"text":"I have been to allot of places for Sushi and Sushi Ichiban is a place I go to over and over and over again. Very well prepared Sushi and very fresh and clean Sashimi. Seriously the sushi from here is just as good as homemade fresh. YOU GOTTA EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I often come here for takeout. I call ahead and pick up and it's always quick and food is good and consistent. Prices are reasonable and it's a great place to go if you are craving sushi in this area."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The staff might seem abrupt but they just want to serve you and get the delicious food to you as soon as possible.  

Have been here for many two people dinners/lunches and also nuclear family and huge extended family.  No matter the size of party, or if you are ordering from menu or all you can eat, the food quality doesn't change from excellent.  

I love getting the huge slices of tuna and octopus.  

The head waitress Kit is awesome, she's so busy but will come and joke with you before turning back to remind one of the other waitresses to bring tea."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best ayce I've tried but it's pretty good. 

We had a party of 4, and we all love salmon so when we ordered the salmon sashimi they gave us much less than we ordered. But that's okay cuz we just ordered it again. 

Food was good. Beef teriyaki was delicious we had to order it again. Spicy salmon sushi and sashimi was something new I haven't seen before and it was good.

Service was slow. 

Ordering style was also new to me. Using an erasable marker on a laminated order sheet. But that meant giving away our menu when submitting our order and having to ask for a new one before we can look at ordering more stuff.

Price was on the higher side.

I would try out other ayce places before coming back here again."}
{"text":"Who can really complain about all you can eat sushi. Service was great and didn't feel over expensive. One type of tea and 20+ types of sushi. Walked in for the day special of buy one bubble tea and get the 2nd free."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places for Sushi.  We introduced people who've never had Sushi before to the delights of both sashimi and sushi here.   We went for Father's Day and it was the busiest I've seen it in a long time and it was the only time  we actually had frozen sashimi.   No, it wasn't supposed to be frozen,  it came to our table that way, sliced, but still frozen.   But edible and still lovely in flavor. The best treats on the menu were the crab and shrimp pizzas on rice round and the smoked eel was wonderful!  These days they have little lists of what was ordered to keep track of things.   At an All You Can eat restaurant there are bound to be missed items and wrong food arriving but sometimes those mistakes are things we'd never try!  I love the service at this restaurant,  I love the food,  the booths are comfortable and it is affordable.   A hint though,  order big on the first round because it does get busy and you may find yourself waiting for a while for the food to arrive.   And yes, their Miso soup and seaweed salad are good and coconut pudding too!  That and the quality of the Tamaki provide insight into the quality of food served at Sushi Ichiban."}
{"text":"Japanese restaurant?? Have not got a chance to try Japanese cuisine explicitly until I visited sushi Ichiban. Though I am not a great judge of Japanese food, this review is all about my impression and the feel of my taste buds.
On a saturday evening, this place looks busy. So quickly went inside to grab a table.
While deciding between Ala carte and All you can eat, ended up with All you can eat as I got to know, we had numerous items to select from and we could order as many dishes as we can and as many times... Wait wait.. hold on.. there is condition on that ' don't waste food , if you,  might be paying more for the wastage.'
So be careful with what you order and what you can eat.

All you can eat was $27 ( excluding taxes ) which seemed little costly but considering the number of dishes on the menu , I felt reasonable.
Service was good and right bang on time. It shows how fast we can eat and order the next round, they serve at the right pace.
Staff were friendly. 
The second round of food didn't taste so good as it was for the first round. Wish they could maintain the same level. 
Best picks were ginger chicken and teriyaki chicken. I expected more about tempura prawn but didn't get the right taste.
There were lots of sushi, crab imitation,coconut pudding, chicken, beef, pork, fish etc;
Ambiance is pretty good too and the sofa are tall enough to keep our group private.
They do not have many options in alcohol though, which was apparent from the menu.

A place to visit for a different feel and taste."}
{"text":"Came for all you can eat. While the food was good, the staff are incredibly rude. My bank card wouldn't work for the full amount ($60) but I was able to put $40 on it. Instead of taking holding on to my ID and letting me run across the street to the atm like a normal restaurant, they made me wait inside and have a friend come by to pay the other 20 bucks. I've never been treated so poorly by restaurant staff in my life."}
{"text":"The Staff is AWFUL here; EVERY SINGLE TIME. 

I'm in a student budget so I'll be honest, I love the value 19$ lunch all you can eat gets me. I will also add that the food isn't bad, pretty decent actually. But the service totally trumps all of that. I tipped 10% one time (when they deserved 0) and the manager lectured me on how I'm CHEAP. I'm very fair with my reviews when it comes to service because I understand people have bad days, but this has happened every time. Bring a water bottle by the way, they probably won't get to you to serve water."}
{"text":"I met some friends for dinner, and we all got the all you can eat deal. The food was ok, not fabulous, but alright. I thought it was a decent deal for what we paid. I didn't have any issues with any of the food not being fresh. The service was quite good, and the atmosphere is very nice. I don't remember if we had leftovers or not, but there were no additional charges on our bill. Maybe it is hit or miss, but I would visit again."}
{"text":"Straight up don't go here. Took 40 minutes to get food and had no refill for water. Food taste bland and although the food is cheap its not worth a cent.
Coming in having to wait longer than usual for the food and being super hungry didn't make it a good experience.
I ended up not giving a tip because they didn't deserve it - when the server realized I didn't tip she literally asked me to tip and asked me if the service is good like really?? She forced me to tip for bad service - their restaurant and staff is just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"They gave me their menu at the BW down the street. Not only were the prices wrong (raised), but, the food was bad. Frozen scallop. Nearly frozen mackerel. Small cuts of farm raised salmon. Dry clam. They also have no clue on how to prepare the rice. Wrong grain. Beaten to death. Cold. I didn't do the all you can eat (missed sign) and was glad about that for a first time. although, it would have been the same price as what I ordered."}
{"text":"I came here on on CHRISTMAS DAY. They were open - 4 to 9 pm. Thank goodness because the boy and I were craving sushi and did not want to cook at all. 

All you can eat sushi is what you would expect - mediocre quality. The tuna definitely had the 'frozen' texture to it. The Ika was 'slimy' - not fresh for sure. But what can you really expect?

But the hot foods is really good: yakitori, panko scallops, korean bbq beef and so much more. 

Thank you for being open on Christmas DAY. I really appreciate it. :)"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!
 Service was excellent, waitresses were very polite. The sushi was fresh and delicious. The restaurant was decently clean. We visit this location often and we will be returning again.

If you're reading that the staff are rude then what those reviewers are missing is that English isn't the staffs first language and they are doing the best they can."}
{"text":"The good value isn't worth it. This place is terrible in so many ways. Poor service. I asked for a dish to be made with rice instead of noodles and they refused. They were not busy this is something they could have easily accommodated. The food was awful and tasted old. All of it was literally worse than the dishes you can get in the frozen section at the grocery store. If you want something quick  choose anywhere else unless you like last week's chicken made with zero spice or flavour."}
{"text":"I am always treated with the utmost respect every time I go here. They smile and make suggestion based on my favorite types of items. I always appreciate places that remember who you are and do what they can to make your meal the best they can. The all you can eat food is average to slightly above and the menu items are good quality for the price. Portions are a good size and service is as I mentioned great for me. Overall a worthwhile stop if you are craving Japanese."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. This is DEFINITELY the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. Restaurant is severely understaffed. Waiter didn't bring me plates, chopsticks or water upon arrival. I was one of two groups in the restaurant and she took 45 min to bring me Sprite! And after this I asked for my change and she refused it to give me. Don't go here unless you want disappointment."}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi restaurants in Calgary, and also some in San Fran, Vancouver and Seattle and Sushi Ichiban is one of my favourites.

Mainly for the AYCE sushi but also because the service is always the same when I go - it's fast, friendly and the food is always delicious. I find the location pretty close to wherever I'm at and I've never had to wait for a table. I like that there are some smaller booths (I normally go with one other friend) but they also have larger booths and can actually remove some walls for large groups (I've been there with my ultimate frisbee team of 20 guys).

The price is great, the food is tasty and the service is always spot on. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for sushi and decided to try even know I read the reviews and they were hit and miss. Well after eating about three different things I was not impressed. The food has a strange taste and texture. I have ate at hundreds of sushi places and never have I had so of the tastes that I have had here. Kinda makes me weary. I would look else where if your looking for sushi and save you self some money 27.99 for dinner."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat Sushi DOES NOT include sashimi. :-( $ per person is expensive for what you are able to order. A La Carte Sushi ordering might be better. I don't think I would return... unless I was in the area and all the other sushi restaurant was closed."}
{"text":"The inside was nice ambient wise.  Service wasn't all that great. We had the all you can eat and they kept missing items that were on our order sheet, that we had to keep reminding them. 
Also what we didn't like is they charge you for left overs $1.50 each sushi  which is quite the scam since you are already paying for it originally when you order it.
there are better sushi places in Calgary and i wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was much better before it changed owners.  The price is more or less the same but the cleanliness and quality are going away with each visit...time to find a new place."}
{"text":"I think the service could really be improved a lot. No smiling while giving service and all the waitresses seem to be tired of us eating there and also  when I gave a low tips in the end because of the poor service...the waitress at check-out did not even talk to me. She put the pen and receipt for me to sign on the table so hard and no \"thank you\" after. She's got really mad with me. But I am only doing this to a service which deserves this."}
{"text":"We always enjoy coming to this sushi place when we crave sushi.  The service is great and the food is fast.  I enjoy the Teryaki Chicken Udon Soup with sushi salmon on the side!"}
{"text":"Poor service, and poor quality sushi make for a restaurant you are better off passing.
Their prices are high, and the cuts of fish are poorly done. The rice isn't seasoned correctly and the other items on the menu were bland and unappealing. This is a typical Chinese owned and run restaurant masquerading as a Japanese restaurant. But that would be about as correct as a hot-dog cart calling themselves a fine steak house.
Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"This place has average sushi which is okay when you are ordering the all you can eat. I find that some things are hit and miss. The Tuna sashimi has always been a hit and is cold and fresh! Great service. Interior is a little run down."}
{"text":"Place is clean and neat. Staff is friendly welcoming us but didn't really ask how are we or if the food is great during our visit. The food is a bit pricy for the amount you get. Sushi is not that great, I've tasted better ones. It's bland and no taste almost. The sauce glazed over is too little. Probably won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"So Sushi Ichiban is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand you have an all you can eat sushi/hot food which are ordered from sheets. On the other hand you have more specialty items like shabu shabu or sukiyaki hot pot. In my opinion its one of best places to come for either one of these hot pots! But the all you can eat sushi/hot food items is not the best (as you would expect!) So this review is more about the hot pots!

Very thinly sliced raw beef is brought out with a selection of fresh veggies and noodles.Then they bring a big boiling pot with a burner full of the broth of choice. I prefer the sukiyaki as it has more flavor. Along side all the meat and veggies they bring a special sauce to dip in and let me tell you its very delicious. Rice is complimentary you just have to ask them.

One thing I must mention. The last time I came here with my cousin the manager came and talked to us for a bit and explained that the special sauce they serve with the shabu shabu was only available at sushi ichiban. I am not sure how true that is , but according to him this is now the only place in the city you can find \"japenese steak sauce\"  in calgary at the moment. The only other Japanese restaurant (that I know of) that has served this sauce was Tokyo garden but they stopped serving it sadly, it was actually a good dipping sauce for sushi.

So for under 20 dollars one can experience a delicious all you can eat hot pot which is actually quite delicious! Its as good as any other shabu shabu experience I have had at other restaurants and its by far the cheapest I have seen for hot pots! 

Just be careful because it is very easy to over eat and get a heavy case of the meat sweats here! It can take you out in no time at all! Check it out! ( the hot pots especially!) Wink!"}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here for dinner one night, weekday. The atmosphere was great - the staff were very welcoming, I love the private table booths; nice fish pond in the middle of the restaurant. We came on a quite night so I'm not sure how it is on the weekends. The food was fantastic, wonderful menu with a large variety. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Sushi Ichiban had been blacklisted in our hearts ever since my wife got violently ill after eating their unagi (a delicious item she still refuses to eat!), but has recently redeemed itself after our friends discovered the alternative to their all you can eat: the gigantic, made to share hot pots. A giant boiler of broth, huge plates of raw veggies and raw beef, ready to dunk and eat - lots of fun, and plenty of opportunities for a grievous injury. The mystery sauce on the side is perfect for the meal."}
{"text":"Our relationship with Sushi Ichiban has run the gamut from \"must-visit sushi AYCE\" to \"let us never visit here again\" to \"OMG this hot pot is AAAAH let's come tomorrow, and again next weekend!\" Kat had a disasterous run-in with a stray unagi during a sushi binge, and it was blacklisted for several years before the guys visited and insisted their sukiyaki hot pot was worth giving the restaurant another chance for. Since then, both Kat's and my most recent birthdays have been hosted here, feasting on the hot pots.

How it works is the waitress (invariably a woman) brings out a large kettle, and a tub of oil: turn it on and watch it boil! A giant tray of raw beef, an even bigger tray of raw veggies and noodles follow, and you basically throw it in and cook it yourself! The interaction and fun of the dining event make it worthwhile, because I for one don't find the food altogether THAT wonderful. I tend to have more fun cooking the beef as rare as possible than actually savoring the minor flavor that you get, though the end result of seven people cooking in hot oil can leave an awful mess. The inevitable dares to try to the broth after its cooled has yet to be taken up. Not a bad place, but I usually find it lacking."}
{"text":"A very odd looking Japanese, hole in the wall esque, restaurant, Sushi Ichiban is OK to have if you're looking for a cheap eat. 

Cheap being, you're over paying for sushi that should have a higher standard. The service was the only quality this place has. The place is set up like a Chinese restaurant, but with traditional Japanese seating and regular western seating. An odd pond in the middle with a water wheel next to the bar makes this place look like a joke. It may look cool to some people, but it tells you what this place is, weird.

If a place offered sushi pizza, you probably shouldnt ever come back. Creativity sometimes isn't the best when it comes to sushi pizza. It sounds dumb, looked nothing like pizza, and tastes like an abomination you know you got it knowing it will end badly for you. Getting off that note, the other food was just fine. Agadashi tofu was nice and firm. Seaweed was refreshing enough to tempt your tastebuds thinking you'd have a fine meal. I got tempura udon because I was scared to even have sushi at a place like this. The tempura was bland, but nice and crisp, light enough to be good with the udon's broth. The udon itself was typically fat and filling, starchy and chalky, but typical with most restaurants so I can't complain. The broth was very mild probably missing a touch of flavor and salt. Still good for the price, but nothing special.

There are definitely better Japanese restaurants with higher quality than here, but it was just an OK meal."}
{"text":"As someone who prefers AYCE sushi over standard ordering - we thought we would give this place a try.

I must say we left the place feeling satisfied and wanting to come back. The food was fast, the server was always checking on us and the atmosphere was your average AYCE sushi restaurant.

My only disappointment was some of the cooked food but the sushi was good!"}
{"text":"Just ok... Not great sushi, but not bad... The place is cool... But I can found Better sushi restaurants in Calgary for the same price... The service is just ok.. Not terrible, but nothing outstanding..."}
{"text":"Very nice!!... All the sushi was very good, and the prices inexpensive ... I really liked all I had...."}
{"text":"I'm always so satisfied coming here! Definitely get the all you can eat Shabu shabu with sushi totally worth your money! The shabu shabu sauce is to die for their sushi is good not like the best of the best but still satisfying. You get the best of both worlds here hot pot and sushi. Their raw oysters are also delicious! Not too gutty"}
{"text":"Ouch, my poor tummy. Sometimes, I'm just not very nice to it. This restaurant would be one of those times.

I planned well and ate a light lunch. But when they handed me two sheets of food and I could have anything on there I wanted, there was no stopping me. I maxed out with 2 rolls and 8 sushi items and also picked a couple of other delicious looking items. It didn't all come out immediately, but rather over the course of ten minutes. Just enough time that I was mostly able to keep up.

And then I was still hungry, so I did it again. There's where I blew it. The food kept coming and coming and coming. Have you ever been so full that you keep chewing and chewing because you don't want to swallow? I hit that point. I ended up with four sushi left and no room. It just wasn't going to happen. So I had to eat the top and the rice balls went into the napkin and home. Sorry about that.

The sushi was fresh and the rolls were creative. The gzoya dumplings were yummy.

The only exception was that the barbecue short ribs were a bit on the fatty side of things. Not in a really bad way, just that I had to pick around the fat. But it was still good.

Would I return? Probably not for at least a month or two. I need to heal. And I might need to buy another belt."}
{"text":"Poor customer service at this restaurant.  

This so-called Japanese restaurant is run by Chinese-speaking sushi chefs.  They make fun of people who cannot speak Chinese.  

Beware!"}
{"text":"Still my top pick for sushi in the south. The freshest fish and fastest service I've had ever. The all you can eat is what I always get. You can go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Five stars, Dan? Really?
You do realize that you're reviewing Sushi Ichiban, right?
-Yes, yes I do realize that. And I stand behind it.

I know when someone sees a five star review from me they may think \"Oh, that idiot must think this is the best restaurant in the city,\" but I have reiterated time and time again that my ratings are based on an establishment's ability to live up to their potential, their customers' expectations and their success within their category.
In this regard, I believe Sushi Ichiban fires on all cylinders.

Is this the best sushi in the city? Of course not. But it is definitely good, and for all-you-can-eat? The price is definitely right.

That being said, I do not think I will get AYCE sushi here very much anymore.

Dan, you do realize that you're reviewing SUSHI Ichiban, right?
-Yes, yes I do.
Did you have a bad experience?
-No, like I said the sushi is definitely good.
Then why would you no longer order all-you-can-eat sushi?

BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT SHABU-SHABU!

The hot pots are by FAR my favourite thing to get at Sushi Ichiban.
At $19 for all-you-can-eat veggies, noodles and thinly sliced beef, I would go out on a limb to say this is one of the best bangs for you buck in the city.
And the best thing about it? Because it is simply beef and veggies that you poach in broth at your own table, this is probably one of the healthiest AYCE meals you can experience. You will not feel that gross sickness easily encountered at a Chinese food buffet where you gorge yourself on a variety of fried foods and thickly sweet sauces.

The interior of the restaurant is comfortable and the staff is ever friendly and helpful (except for those times where they question and charge you for the leftover items from your all-you-can-eat sushi binge. I have seen SOME people -no names- actually go to lengths to sneak the leftovers in their pants and flush them down the toilet to avoid the extra charge for wasted sushi).

All in all, Sushi Ichiban is a great place and I love the hot pots so much that I will be back as long as they have it on the menu."}
