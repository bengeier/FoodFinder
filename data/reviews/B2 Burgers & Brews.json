{"text":"This is my favorite spot for Sunday football with friends and family.  Awesome food, great service and lots of TVs for no matter which team you want to watch play. This spot is fairly new and it won't be long before it is packed at all times!"}
{"text":"We were early on a Monday and it was not very busy. Great beer selection. It was a tough choice. I ordered my burger medium and it was cooked perfect. It also had that grilled smell like I cooked it myself. It was very good. The frys were crispy and onion rings were good. My only negative was the ranch dressing was thin and flavorless. It was a great dinner and we will be back."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time. Our waitress was super friendly and made recommendations of the Burgers. I had the chicken sandwich and my husband had the sliders. It was soooo good. I will for sure return."}
{"text":"Tried for first time today. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Everything was good except the burger was over cooked. I ordered medium rare and it came out well.   It is increasingly difficult to get a burger served medium rare anywhere with a red or even center.    Will give B2 another shot once they iron out wrinkles."}
{"text":"Yelp is a great app. I like all the different flavors it has describing the different places."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great!  Happy hour till 7 and then reverse happy hour 9-close?!  Yes!  Wasn't crazy hungry so just got some wings. They were huge!  Couldn't even eat all 12 of them.  Very tasty though and well worth the money.  Bartender was awesome. Very personable,  chatty,  and super friendly.  We will def be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Love love love! The burgers are good! And super cheap too! As well as all the beer they have. Also cheap! Makes a great quick stop for that meal you missed, or a great hangout when you and your buddies want to get together! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Burger was very good. I'm not a big burger person because I'm almost always disappointed. This one has a very good flavor but wasn't very warm. The sweet potato tots were tasty but they fall apart easily. Maybe if they cooked them a little longer they'd stay in one piece?? Beer was local but I don't think they brew here. I had a 4 Peaks that had a bit of a watery mouth feel but at least they had a Stout. Sink was about to fall off the wall in the lady's room. That's a broken foot and a law suit in waiting.  Lots of games on the side making obnoxious noises.  My husband said the men's room was in rough shape."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a burger. The appetizers are delicious and there is a nice selection of local craft brews! Fun atmosphere with lots of sports on TV,  video games, pool, darts, corn hole, and more. A nice addition to the Uptown part of Chandler."}
{"text":"Every time I go there the service and quality of food declined. I always try and support local businesses for I have lived in Chandler over 30 years. This place has declined in all aspects of service and especially quality."}
{"text":"Fkn great!  Food was phenomenal!  The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was friendly, but still fun!  I would come here daily if I lived in phoenix/surrounding area! *****!+"}
{"text":"I hate posting negative reviews, especially of somewhere that's new, but I will not be returning. If you end up boxing your food two minutes after receiving it, you k ow there's a problem. Meat quality was about equivalent of plain sale beef patties and tossed on a backyard grill. Sweet potato tots were mushy on the inside, like completely mushy. My soda tasted musty and gross from unclean lines. My fiances beer was flat. Boneless wings in teriyaki and Buffalo were just.... Kinda ugh. The sauces were mostly tasteless, well aside from vinegar, anyway. The only good things I have to say about this place are, the service was pretty good, and their bacon is delicious. Other than that, boneless wings and 2 almost untouched burger entrees are going to my dog.  Edit: we also apparently didn't even get the happy hour pricing like we were supposed to. Can I emphasize never again?!"}
{"text":"Kinda been waiting on this place to open. I love beer, I love burgers. Must be a good fit.  Just got the chance today. I'll start by saying the place is cavernous. Unlike he place that was there before there is good lighting and it's clean!  The bartender was friendly and quick. The burger was cooked perfectly and the onion rings were outstanding.  Please be advised! The burgers are thick and juicy! It takes a little bit longer to cook 'em. I will say that these babies are worth the extra few minutes!  I recommend B2 for the burgers! Cold beer! And the excellent service."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!! We were surprised there weren't many people there, but I guess it was Sunday night. A hidden gem to be sure, maybe too hidden. The outside of the restaurant itself could be hopped up a bit so it's more noticeable from the street. I think they're fairly new, but once the word gets around no doubt it will be a huge success. Oh, and bring your appetite!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger/sports bar places in the area! Food is always great! The staff is so personable and friendly... I have tried about 1/2 there burger menu. That doesn't include the other options I've tried like some of their bowls and today I tried the gyro which was absolutely perfect! I've had to deal with two different bartenders there Josh and Eli are awesome and always ready to give recommendations for newcomers checking out the menu for the first time... If your looking for a great place to bring the family during the week or weekend fun or just a place to enjoy a cocktail or two with good music and a great environment come check out this place! I will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger, terrible service. The terrible service far outweighed the quality of the burger so will not be back. We were there for the dueling pianos night and they took reservations for parties of 8 or more. They clearly had to rent tables and chairs and had the place full of them when we got there at 6:00. Luckily there was one of their regular tables still open so we sat there. I tell you all this to say that if you take that many reservations, maybe you should staff up to accommodate all of the customers you're expecting. We went with empty drinks and empty water glasses which should never happen if your service is up to standard. One of the couples in our group ordered food that never came but when they asked for their bill, the food was on it (which they of course asked to be taken off the bill and that was another 20 minutes). Very doubtful we'll be back. There are too many other options where the burgers are just as good and the service is great."}
{"text":"We have stopped by now at least 3 times. They have excellent choice of craft beers, good happy hour prices - crafts are $4 wells are $3 domestic drafts are $3. A nice choice of $5 happy hour munchies. I've had the beef sliders, fries, onion rings and the dorito taco burger (all at different times) :-) All very good. My son had mushroom swiss burger cooked perfectly to order. Service was good. It was a little warm in there today and could have been a little cooler. They did a awesome job on the remodel. Very open, lots of windows. Ok for kids too. More a restaurant than bar."}
{"text":"Found this place today to have a late lunch with my boyfriend. Pleasantly surprised. Our server JJ was awesome, very personable. Had bacon cheeseburgers with fries, sweet potato tots and ceaser salads. The food was amazing! Although we didn't have a beer, they had a great selection. Try these guys out, if you have any issues...say something and give them a chance to fix it. Love to support new places. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Totally amazing we had spot on recommendations  from Karrisa, the burgers did not disappoint and the beer was cold  and did I mention the fries those were amazing as well we will def be back"}
{"text":"I went tonight with my wife and my four-year-old son. We should've walked out as soon as we walked in. Either the air conditioning was broken, or they had the thermostat turned all the way up. A table of three gentlemen that came in right before us, we're seated and served right away. After we were seated it took us 10 minutes to get a drink order in. 15 minutes later the server came back to drop off the drinks, and take our order. It was Friday and they had an all you can eat fish special. I asked about it and the server said it was a big piece of fish served between a bun like a fish sandwich that came with fries. I opted for that, my sons had some chicken strips and fries, and my wife had a backyard cheeseburger. We waited, and we waited watch the table I came in right before us have probably for helpings of fish and we're done before we got our food. 45 minutes in before we got our food. The big piece of fish with my server told me about was no bigger or thicker than a slice of American cheese. Whatever it's all you can eat though right? It is if your server ever comes back. I was ready for tomorrow fish but my family was done eating and ready to go. I had to go up to the station to pay. I left hungry and incredibly unsatisfied. It's unfortunate We live right down the street, we would've been regulars. However based on my experience we will never return, and give her business to Jolie's across the street."}
{"text":"I really like the breakfast burger. Has everything on it. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you come in here expecting exactly what it is, you are going to be MORE than satisfied. It's a casual spot with a sports bar feel and multiple games to play as well. It's nothing gourmet, but the burgers/all food are unique and DELICIOUS. There are roughly 484960271625 TVs, so you'll have a great view no matter where you sit. As long as you don't come in here expecting something super trendy and modern, you will be happy and so will your belly."}
{"text":"This place is newly opened,  They need to do some serious upgrading.  They do have an extensive beer list very nice.  We ordered all you can eat fish,  My 10 year old son ordered hamburger sliders.  The fish was really good,  However they did not give us all we could eat.  When we asked for a second round of fish they gave us one piece."}
{"text":"I'm a big catsup and mustard guy, but I forgot to apply either while I ate half my \"backyard burger\" and steak fries (THICK burger and tons of fries). A really good and reasonably priced burger - not that charcoal taste I yearn for, but pretty darn good. Fries were really good. The place is huge but we got there early and found a couple chairs at the bar, where the bartender happily gave us samples of several beers. Settled on a pretty good oatmeal stout on tap. So, big tasty burgers, absolutely fabulous bacon and fries, good but slightly undercooked sweet potato tots. Good view of several TV's from about anywhere. The service was friendly and fast. Will return."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to visiting this place. Unfortunately...not what I was hoping. Our server Travis was very nice and did his best (brand new server on his own). They ran out of iced tea and no grenadine for drinks. The food was not worth the price. Over cooked (burgers we're burnt), Doritos nachos were sad ( shredded Colby jack cheese not nachos cheese), Mac and cheese burger was horrible (3 precooked Mac and cheese bites sitting on top of an over cooked patty). Protein bowl was very dry and bland. Pulled pork sandwich was dry, not much BBQ sauce.   Overall I'm not impressed. Not a place I will visit again for food."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times since it's opened. Awesome food and great service. The drinks are great and there's a huge selection of beers. Their drink prices are hard to beat. B2 is clean and has plenty of room. We've gone in between 3 and 5 in the afternoon so I can't say what the other times of the day are like. We've met the owner and he's a super nice guy. Christine is an outstanding bartender."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday and found no ambiance. Tvs are great, plenty. Food on the other hand ask for medium but got a medium very well. Even though it was empty the waitress was in a hurry to get us out"}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and both times were decent. Bartenders offered friendly relaxed conversation and the food was good also. My burger came out cooked to temp and the fried asparagus was a healthy portion. Prices might be a little steep but it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! Yes, they're new and still working out some kinks. We expect that of any new establishment. The place is huge, as the former business was, but a huge improvement from before. Totally forgot the place is lined with windows as previously they were covered, which made the place dark and dismal. No more! Totally open and nice to see outside for once. Menu had quite the variety including lots of beers on tap. We had the Doritos nachos. Doritos! Nachos! (why didn't I think of that?!) They were delish. I had the spicy PB&J burger on a pretzel bun with sweet potato tots. Amazing! Hubs had the bison burger B2 bomber. Equally as good. We're excited to have a good burger place in the neighborhood again. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went two days ago. Love the atmosphere, the entertainment section and food! They are brand new so of course there will be some kinks to work out. It would be good to add a nice gourmet grilled cheese to the menu for the vegetarians as most other resturaunts do. This seems like an AZ thing but it would also be nice to get extra napkins when the food is brought out without having to ask. The only other issue is there are multiple TV's but they all play the same event. I messaged the Facebook page and got an immediate response stating they will look into the TV issue. 5 stars because the food, staff and cleaniness were great! This place has a lot of potential! Did I mention the food is good! The spicy PB and J burger I ordered was cooked to perfection and that was some good eating. Great selection on craft beers served cold! I can see this place becoming a regular spot for us. In fact going again later today!"}
{"text":"I was in Burgers and Brews on, I believe, their 3rd night open. It was quiet, but it was also Wednesday night. What struck me first was how freakin huge the place is. They really opened up the old bar that was here, and I like the spacious layout and clear view with windows all the way around. My only concern would be, even when it is a slightly busy, it may be 1/3 full, which doesn't always help the atmosphere.  I also noticed the entertainment area, with pool, darts, pop-a-shot, etc...and immediately thought, sweet, I can bring the kids. Plenty of TV's and it seems like a good spot to catch a game. We sat at the bar and were welcomed and served by a very nice bartender. The bar itself is not all that impressive, but the service and beer menu were. The beer menu had a nice mix of styles and included some locals (Four Peaks, O.H.S.O, and others.) B2 will have a chance to earn a fifth star my next stop in. This is when I will try one of their delicious sounding burgers- there are about 14 to choose from! Cheers and good luck B2!"}
{"text":"Had the happy hour sliders $5 with fries. Pretty good deal. I also got the call happy hour drink for $5 three olives pear wih ginger beer. Very clean place. Lots of friendly staff. Fries had good flavor. Dont get ranch its not the yummy homemade kind. Ranch is definitely out of a bottle."}
{"text":"Don't bother...that is $30 I'll never get back!  Worst food (hockey pucks for burgers, dry pulled pork) , way over priced (seriously $11 for a BLT salad!), No kids menu, ran out of almost anything we tried to order (that should have been a sign to run!), and charged for refills (iced tea and pop...$2.75 each...seriously). I will never go here again and don't bother wasting your time or money. Incredible disappointment."}
{"text":"I must be honest and say I gave a pretty bad, but honest review of the last two visits at this establishment. I'd give it 4 stars at the moment but I'm going to give it 5 to make up for the previous visit that possibly should've been rated a 2. Ok with that being said. I recently went back and visited \"Burgers & Brews\". I'm happy to say that they did fix the pool cues, chicken fingers and the service was much better! I don't want to take credit for the improvement of the place but I definitely saw change! One thing that really impressed me is that my previous post I meant to address the bathroom and it's lack of partitions. Now they've locked the doors mentioning until it's up to par they will not be accessible. This to me shows that ownership is taking responsibility in improvement and communication w/ staff. So thank you for the effort, it goes noticed! Look forward to next time..... No more reviews from me!!... :)"}
{"text":"I have never in my life dealt with a more immature manager. For someone to talk shit to their customers for simply expressing how horrible their experience was, is appalling. I've never had a \"manager\" speak in such a way. Had I video taped The altercation it would've been unfortunate for this astablishment. The mushroom swiss burger (which is easy to make) was absolutely awful. My mother in law had too send her food back 4 times and it was still awful tasting. I would avoid this place purely for the taste, but God forbid you have a problem the manager will go ahead and talk shit and be sarcastic. It's very unfortunate, because I had only heard good things."}
{"text":"Didn't actually go but ordered with Ubereats and it was amazing! Def wanna check the place out now.  The sweet potato tots were delicious!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try out this place for Dueling Pianos tonight. We had made reservations earlier in the week for a total of 28 people. First of all, the tables we were sat at were rentals, cafeteria style, with cramped in chairs, so you could barely move and maneuver in and out. We had one waitress to wait on the ENTIRE table, and we weren't her only table. The long cafeteria table was not conducive to socializing with each other. It took 30 minutes to get a drink. The credit card system went down, so when we went up to the bar at one point because the wait was so long to get one from our waitress, we were told they couldn't get us our shots because the credit card system was down.  The food took 50 minutes to get. They ran out of Tito's 5 minutes after we got there. We were told that 7pm was the latest they could take reservations. The dueling pianos were 20 min late starting when they were supposed to start at 8. I don't blame the waitress for the slowness-this falls 100% on the management and their failure to prepare for the crowd. They knew early in the week how many reservations they had because the guy who took mine said they already had 150 ppl at that point. Bad taste left for all of us."}
{"text":"It's called burgers and brews. So come here and get a BURGER and a BREW. Mac and cheese burger is pretty pretty good. Also they have those nice pretzel buns... so yeah"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday around 1 pm. There were 3 other tables at the time we sat down. It took about 10 min for a server to bring us beers and took an order. Then it took nearly 45 min for 2 burgers and fries. Burgers weren't cooked to orders and very blend. I ordered jalapeño burger and I had to put some ketchup & mustard because it was so blend. My husband asked for BBQ sauce on the side and he got it on his burger anyway AND on the side.  Kitchen vent wasn't working properly so the whole place was so smoky. Luckily they comped one of the burgers for a delayed service. Server was friendly but not prompt. We would give them another try if the food was good but it was nothing out of ordinary."}
{"text":"My husband and I was looking forward to check this place out. We love the concept (beer b  We arrived last night and nobody was at the main hostess table to give us a menu and we stood there until another customer said we could seat ourselves however grab a menu now because the waitress didn't give him one and he has been waiting for awhile. It wasn't busy so I was shocked at the lack of attentive ppl near the front.  At that point we both agree to leave, can't do business in a place that does acknowledge you properly.  Hmm might give it a shot if I see some positive reviews regarding their attentiveness."}
{"text":"The restaurant had just opened from the former Reef and was dirty.  The first table we sat at had dried gum or something on the table top, so we moved to another table and it has some kind of gunk dried on it.  The server said they were having a slow start up since the Reef had such a bad reputation for being dirty.  Well....  The second time, the air conditioning was not working.  Not a good sign.  Service was mediocre, slow even though the place was pretty empty.  I wish them luck as I did like the owner."}
{"text":"Buffalo and B2 burgers were very tasty and well-cooked (juicy burgers.)  Great selection of local beers and the bartender was very personable. We will be back.  After we've tried more of the menu, Will potentially increase this to a 5 star."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. The first time i felt that the appetizer portion on the cheese curds was way small for a price tag of $7.00.  The second time, the place was not busy however we watched our food sitting at the window for about 10 min before it was brought to our table.  My Bison burger was cold to the touch and tasted horrible.   One more thing that it's completely nerve racking is that they have some games and whenever someone is playing the air hockey machine, the noise is unbearable. You can't even hear the background music over the continuous bang and clack.   I don't believe I will ever comeback."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. First time was cool but place was empty. I wondered if the restaurant would last? Well now I know the answer! We went tonight with high hopes. They proceeded to say entire restaurant was reserved, yet it was a ghost town. Party didn't start til 8. It was 6. We sat outside. Happy hour supposed to be til 7. \"We decided we don't do happy hour on Friday Saturday when we have special events\". We question and ask the guy who brings out the food. \"Oh I'm the owner\". Dude doesn't say anything other than that. Food winds up being lukewarm, even though we ordered it ten minutes before that. Needless to say, we won't be back. I would suggest others just don't go."}
{"text":"My family went there hoping for a good burger place to go to near our home. When we got there, no one was at the door to seat us, we got out own silverware and menus. Finally someone who I guess work there sat us. It was 5:30. We sat for 10 mins without anyone ask what we wanted to drink and then when our waitress finally came over she told us we had 10 mins until happy hour was done and went to get our drinks. Did not see her again for 15 mins by then happy hour was over and we could not get any of the specials. She finally showed up again and we got to order. 30 mins later finally got our food. The food was fine, not a lot of fries with the meal. Our waitress boyfriend came in and she gave most of her attention to him and did not pay attention to her tables. We left there very unimpressed and may go back to try a different waitress because most seem to be very good but ours was horrible."}
{"text":"I don't imagine this place will make it very long.  Menu items are rather expensive. We ordered a couple of burgers and six wings. The hot sauce was awful and the ranch was runny as if it were watered down. There's a lot of burgers to choose from but they are all coupled with odd items. They tasted bad and my wife's was overcooked. I also had a salad and it was actually warm. By all accounts the food is useless and expensive and we were still charged full price for everything.  The inside of the the place is cold and uninviting as well. Needless to say, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've had better food at [insert your least liked fast food joint here]. I've had a better time at [fast food joint]. I've paid much less for all the above at [fast food joint].  The one star (in addition to being the lowest score possible) is for the waitress who served us. As a matter of fact, she's the only reason I didn't include in this review that the score should be zero stars if it were possible. But, management has her waiting on the ENTIRE dining floor! She's the ONLY one there. Despite this, her service was fast, efficient, and pleasant.  But, everything else is awful. This is a brand new place in a town that has hundreds of restaurants to compete with, but the Men's Room is unfinished. Despite having two urinals and a toilet, only one person can use it at a time if he remembers to slide the slipshod lock on the door. There's a sign on the door that apologizes for this and tries to explain that they're planning on installing dividers... someday.  Like another reviewer mentioned, the place is enormous but is half-filled with tables and half-filled with carny games. Half of the tables (the half that a furthest from the bar) are high bar tables. There's no greeter and no sign telling you to seat yourself, so you just... guess. The top part of the grill in the kitchen can be seen from the \"dining room\" but it looks awful; it's nothing that should be shown off. As a matter of fact, I never actually saw anyone actually AT the grill. I have an app on my iPhone that measures ambient decibels in a room and it at times was as high as 85 in this restaurant - at this level, your hearing can become damaged after a certain amount of time. And, it's definitely too loud for conversation.  Finally, the food was abysmal. None of the four in our party enjoyed their meals. Three of them had the \"Backyard Burger\" (essentially a BBQ burger) and I had the \"Macaroni & Cheese Burger\". It was at least six inches high, so I had to use the provided steak knife to eat it. The patty was bland, the meat practically tasteless. The veggies were fresh and fairly tasty. But the Mac & Cheese was 3-4 triangular, deep fried Mac & Cheese bites (I'm pretty sure they were http://www.mccainusafoodservice.com/Product/Detail/AnchorBatteredMacAndCheeseWedges) - also tasteless. I asked for their sweet potato tots because the waitress said they were delicious, so I was looking forward to those. But, it turns out they'd run out and gave me sweet potato fries instead. And, they were cold. I mentioned this, very kindly and they brought out a second serving fresh from the fryer. But, then I tasted them - also tasteless. Two others in my party couldn't believe that so they tried them too - they agreed they're tasteless.  My guess is the owner hurriedly threw together plans for the place, hired a bunch of nobodies off the street, and got the place built, hoping enough people would come in for the newness to make enough money to be able to then afford to revamp the place. Bad plan. Hopefully the place can survive long enough to make the bad plan work and the place will actually get revamped. Otherwise, stay away."}
{"text":"A disappointing burger joint with nothing special about it. Huge layout but the place is extremely loud. Between pool and a few other games, no music and two tvs with the sound barely on all you can hear is excessive noise. It also felt like there was no AC on at all. My dad's and my burger had no flavor and was overcooked, also both servers didn't know the menu so most of our questions were met with a wait time for an answer. Good selection of local beers but no prices on them. Ordered the build your own burger with bison only to have it cost an extra three dollars which was not specified on the menu or warned about by the server. Overall not a good experience and we will most likely not be back, many other places to go with better food and service."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service! I used to go here a few times a week, because it's so close. At first, I thought it was pretty good. The burger has been the only thing to be consistent. The service has declined. They always are forgetting something or making something wrong. The last time I went in (a week ago), to pick up my to go order, the bartender came & told me that they gave my order to an UberEats driver & would that be ok? What do u mean is that ok? What other choice did I have at that time?  The teriyaki sauce they used to use for the protein bowls has now been substituted with a soy sauce. It completely gives it another taste.  This place is trying to save money by cutting corners & it is showing. I will not be disappointed yet again with another trip to b2."}
{"text":"WAY too loud.  Props to the dueling pianos and the great song selections but the noise level is good for one of two things. 1) just wanting to sing along and not bothering with conversation. 2) being too drunk to string two words together and just wanting to sway to the music. Had a beer and moved on. The jalapeño cheese curds were delish so we may try to come back during the day to try the rest of the food. Maybe."}
{"text":"I went in this Monday afternoon to kill sometime and get a beer or two, as soon as I walked in the manager and the bartender just stared at me blank faced and I had to acknowledge them and say can I get a beer? No welcome, hello to me or anything. I was never offered a menu the whole time I was there, and never even told the price of the beer I was getting. I asked her and she said idk I think 5, and I also kept getting asked if I was done or not, all around not a good experience. I don't imagine it will be open long considering all these other bad reviews."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this place twice in a week. The atmosphere is great, the burgers are unique and delicious, the beer is local and good price and the service is very good. I had a burger with the sweet potato tots both times. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The burgers under cooked the bacon is burnt the cook sucks. Waitresses are nice tv selection is ok."}
{"text":"My wife and I just went in to check out the place now that they are open. We tried the jalapeno cheese curds, porky burger and steak bowl. Although they did not have rice ready for the bowl, it tasted good and had potential. The burger and curds were quite good though.   We sat at the bar, and watched the football games, which worked out really well with the tv's behind the bar. The bartender was very attentive and tried hard to find a drink my wife would like, and had no problem letting her try several until she found something she liked.   After eating, we had some fun playing darts and basketball. They also had cornole, air hockey, pool, and a couple arcade games.   As locals, it's nice to know there is something within walking distance that has great food, great staff, and fun games. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Prices were high and the buger was mediocre. They need to have a better seating selection as well. I was excited for the opening because I'm right down the street, but it was a big let down."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Burgers & Brews and I must say the two times I've been I've been impressed with the food and the service. The prices I feel are fare.   It is a great place to watch football on Sundays to they have several TVs and any where you sit in the place is centrally located to a TV."}
{"text":"Very good new place. Well reimagined old place. Much better now. Try the Bison Burger!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why reviews are so mixed- just ate the 'jalapeño burger' from old menu and it was phenomenal! Juiciest burger I have ever had AND the fries are amaaaaaaaazing! My daughter got kids grilled chicken basket and the grilled chicken was so flavorful (and the size of my head, literally) that I would order that as my entree. Lots of local beers too and a TON of games for the kids so my daughter was having a great time while we waited for the food."}
{"text":"So I went here for dinner last night due to the reviews and all the talk on the FB group \"living chandler.\" My husband and I love burgers and always on the hunt to find out next favorite go-to. When we first walked in, it seemed like a good place, family friendly with even some arcade games that instantly got my 3 year old excited. We walked in at 6:30, surprisingly we made it in time for happy hour which ended at 7. It took 12 minutes for a waitress to come get our drink order. Then she dropped off our drinks, and didn't come back! Literally no where to be found, with a hangry toddler I had to go order food from the bartender. Keep in mind, this place wasn't even too busy. It seems there was only one waitress for the whole floor, one bartender and one cook. Which brings me to my next issue, one cook. It literally took us FOREVER to get our order. We didn't end up leaving until a little after 8 and all we got was 2 burgers and a chicken tender meal. The basic burger was 10 plus an up charge for cheese. I added bacon to mine, and it didn't even come with bacon. I didn't even bother to send back because I was so worried it would take forever again. The burgers were good, I wouldn't say that the basic burger was 12 dollars worth, but it definitely was juicy and tasty. Not sure if we will be back, which is unfortunate, seems like it has potential!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and friendly staff! Loved that there was a pool table and corn hole. Great place to hang out with friends and throw a few back. Definitely recommend the sweet potato tots! Excited to go back and try another new burger ."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for their first day open. A few bugs yet to work out but I'm sure they'll get it sorted quickly.  Menu: Some pretty interesting finds on this menu including the Doritos Taco Burger, Doritos Nachos, Spicy PBJ & Bacon Burger, and the Donut Burger.  Items missing from the menu that I wish they had: grilled mushrooms for topping burgers & nacho cheese sauce for dipping fries.  Food Allergy Friendliness: They do a pretty good job of making sure you get something that is safe for you to eat. They do have gluten free buns. Unfortunately, the fries are battered and I assume everything is fried in the same oil, however, the waitress didn't get back to me when I asked about this so double check.  Food Quality: Burgers are delicious! He got the Backyard Burger (BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato) and I got the Jalapeno Burger without cheese and I added pickles (grilled jalapeno, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, onion, tomatoes).  The burgers came out a little over, we asked for them medium and he got medium well and I got somewhere in the middle. They were still juicy and delicious, evenly seasoned. All the toppings were fresh and crisp and the tomatoes were even ripe!  Beer Selection: Not bad, good variety. However, nothing dark, which was disappointing. Lots of light domestics and IPA's. Hopefully, this will evolve to be a nice craft beer menu with a good variety as they get the hang of things.  Service: Very friendly staff. They were attentive without being over bearing. Our waitress obviously cared and apologized for some of the bugs since it was opening day.  Price: Price is fair. He had a beer and I had an iced tea with our two burgers and the tab was $36.   We'll go back and check this out again and I'm sure the bugs will be worked out by then and this place will be pretty awesome. We're excited to have a new burger joint in the hood!"}
{"text":"B2 is a new place and so far doing awesome! Their happy hour prices are great. I tried the polled pork sliders and they were delicious! Great place to hang with friends and there are plenty of games for the kids. The staff is super nice, the bartender Christine is on it with service. Absolutely going back, I say give it a try it's always fun to find new places especially ones like B2."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place and I'm glad I did. The burgers were delicious as well as the sweet potato tots. Great beers on tap and delicious food at a good price. Thank you Christine for your excellent service. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Fries are super yummy, burger was good. I went on a Friday at 12:30,if you go for a work lunch ( I get and hr) then this might not want to be where you head, took a pretty long time to get the food, but it was worth the wait.  It's a very open layout, a few large tv's behind the bar, corn hole, and random arcade games. Def. Has potential."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very clean interior with a ton of video game and non-video game options. When I come back I will bring my girls for I know they will love it. But tonight it was just my wife and I and the experience was perfect. Great service (thanks Jackie), great boneless wings (cooked perfectly) and one-of-the-best burgers I've had in a long time. Better than Cold Beers & CB by a mile! Will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Bartender Christine is awesome.    Beer and food is great, definitely a chill spot.  Games and lots of TVs.  Good happy hour deals and 2-7, can't beat that.  Owner Wally is pretty cool too! :)"}
{"text":"I did the Atomic Burger Challenge 24. The burger patties were exceptional. The wings are nice and juicy. They have a good selection of local beers on tap. I definitely recommend coming here. My wife had the breakfast burger which was also good. I had to sample some of everything at the table. I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"The best tasting juicy burgers and owner Wally in Chandler...I tried many other Chandler places and nothing compares ... only Hopdaddy's in Phoenix on Camelback is this good too.  So have one here and one there yay.."}
{"text":"Walked in around 10:20pm on a Wednesday. The bartender was in the parking lot chasing an ex. Sat at the bar for 10 minutes without being served. No one was behind the counter. Someone with ill intentions could have taken off with just anything. When the bartender finally walked back into the bar. I asked if I could order something and she said \"yeah hold on a minute\" and went back outside to talk to her ex. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices are great compared to other local bars. $5 sliders with fries! Can't beat it. Sliders were delish and the fries were seasoned just right. Also had honey BBQ boneless chicken. Very good munchie for happy hour. Only thing negative - the ranch dressing is oddly runny and very mild in taste. They still have bugs to work out like every other new restaurant. Give it a chance, maybe even two. This place has definitely potential. We will be back! Welcome to the neighborhood Wally and Crew! Best of Luck. Hope you are all settling in and staying awhile!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd like it, but I did. I loved my burger! Bacon was crisp and the cheddar was gooey. Some of the best fries ever.. You would be 5 star if you didn't charge me for that side of ranch. Come on... It's like mayo. But a very solid burger and fries. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am always in search of that burger place that understands how important it is to start with a few basics... fresh ground beef, good fresh bread and don't over cook it. Sounds easy but 9 times out of 10 you get burned. Not at this place.. they get it and have some really cool options and the thick cut bacon was a nice surprise as well along with a great craft beer selection that made me happy."}
{"text":"The food's great and staff are friendly, but the kitchen fire has really set them back. The initial menu was sparse, but they've since grown to offer more options including some pretty awesome rice bowls. They've got a great selection of craft beers from nearby states as well as a great liquor selection.   The staff are always friendly and I've noticed leadership has no problem rolling up their sleeves and jumping in to help their staff! Love the jukebox since you can use the app and the bar games are pretty fun.  B2 has seemed to struggle with the business aspect. There's really been no social media presence since the summer's build out. Nothing on Twitter or F/B until a couple of days before the opening and nothing now about being close for nearly a month save the hiring event. I really like this place, but I'm afraid it's not long for this world given the small promoting it has done all year. :("}
