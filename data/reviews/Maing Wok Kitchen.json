{"text":"Wonton soup was oddly bland and appeared to be artificially colored.  Would not order again.  Pork fried rice was OK.  Service was fast and prices OK."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" Chinese take out place in North Ridgeville! Great General TSO Chicken and Hunan Chicken! The staff/owners are very friendly as well and provide a VERY consistent product!"}
{"text":"Ordered online. Food not ready when I arrived. Way too much food coloring in very bland egg drop soup and equally bland \"fried\" rice. Unfriendly service. Didn't even say thank you. Small portion size in combo meal. Will not be going back. Don't waste your time or money. 
Little Hong Kong down the street is better!"}
{"text":"Very good food and reasonably priced. Place looks a bit dingy but don't all Chinese restaurants?

Food was fresh and warm and had flavor. People running it were friendly too.

Recommended for folks looking for a fast yummy meal!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Ordered two combination platters and an order of boneless ribs (5). My mistake - check the bag to make sure order is all there before walking out. Got home to discover the boneless ribs were not there (But was charged for them).
We called the store and were challenged if we had actually ordered them (we had, and were charged for them!). We confirmed this with the guy on the phone. This store delivers too, so wouldn't you think they would offer to bring some out? No, just arguing with us if we are sure we ordered them. 
As for the food we did get... \"chicken and broccoli\" the wife said was good. \"Sesame Chicken,\" according to the menu, was supposed to be \"Hot & Spicy\". It wasn't. No spice at all.
Finally... No sauces like duck sauce or soy sauce were included or offered at checkout. (Again, my fault for not checking) Don't know if they even have them available as I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Decided to get some take out from Maing Wok based on some recommendations from friends. Ordered crab rangoon, sweet and sour chicken, and General tso's chicken around 6 PM on a Sunday. Everything was terrible. The entire meal looked and tasted like it had been sitting out all day. The food had clearly been microwaved. There was no other patrons and no cars in the parking lot. The person behind the counter was more interested in the DVD she was watching than getting my order ready. With all of the takeout options I highly doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out online (best feature of the restaurant) on a Monday night.

Honestly, nothing in our order was very good.  The food was buffet quality, at best.  At worst, I had to doctor it in order to make it palatable.  I had General Tso's Chicken...the chicken pieces were overly breaded and ball-shaped (very odd).  The sauce was not pleasant, at all.  The egg roll was marginal, and the hot & sour soup was relatively bland, save a strong peppery flavor that my wife did not appreciate.

Long and short...we are still looking for quality Chinese food on the west side."}
{"text":"Just moved to north ridgeville a few weeks ago and this place is very close. Was very shocked they had an entire website with online ordering, so convenient. 

Food was great! Lunch prices were awesome and plenty off food. Egg rolls were very crispy and hot, will order every time."}
{"text":"Wow I'm shocked this place doesn't have any reviews. I moved away years ago but always go here when I'm home to see family.  This Chinese rest has been here for ever and the owners are great. The food is amazing and prices are great.  Quick and quality service! My husband swears it's his favorite egg roll and he's Asian & traveled all over the country.  Their steamed dumplings are very good.  Pork fried rice is always a must.   Highly recommend"}
