{"text":"I have been to Mikey's Bistro three times over the last couple months and have ONLY AWESOME things to say.  GREAT FOOD and I have been there with a large group of 10 work colleagues and everyone was happy with what they ordered Home burger, Veggie Burger, Roti, Jerk Chicken.  I would like to give a special mention to the ONION rings and wedges, so good!! Crispy but not greasy and sooo delicious!  I normally do not like to recommend restaurants because people are often picky and have different expectations but I have been thanked many times for introducing people to this great establishment.  the service is quick, I can always manage to get there and back over my lunch hour without eating too quickly.  I have a particular fondness for Mikey and Debbie who both are super friendly and provide the best food and service possible. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the staff is so nice! Always one of the first places I think of for tasty and quick food! Highly recommend if your in Brampton you should definitely give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I just bought Onion rings for almost $6. Walked away with the peculiarly light box feeling like I got ripped off. Sat down at my desk to eat the rings begrudgingly and was like...ok, you can get away with that price. #legit  Some days later...#goodservice   I had to have more of those Onion rings, so I went back for lunch today. The chef (and owner?) overheard me place my order and must have connected me with the review I posted last week. He thanked me for the post and conceded forthwith that the other order's portion could have been bigger.   Today's portion was a steal; I would have gladly paid the same for less. Respect tho. #consistentflavour  I look forward to forgetting my lunch again so I can sample the rest of the menu...  ...with a side of rings."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try a new place in south Brampton. There is a Mike at Mikey's Bistro. Their Uber Eat info states they have Caribbean food. The menu is eclectic with standard bistro fare as well as Caribbean bistro favourites like curry chicken, jerk chicken, and oxtail stew. Or jerked chicken or beef burgers as well as \"roti\". Upon entering the restaurant it is clean and inviting with an intimate setting. We were greeted by a waitress who was attentive and friendly. My wife ordered the jerk chicken and I ordered the oxtail stew. The food was \"spot on\" as far authenticity and flavour. From beginning to end it was a great experience. BTW, they have a liquor license and will soon have patio seating for the summer."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend on a Friday for the first time and had the jerk chicken stir fried rice. We also had the macaroni and cheese with shrimp as an appetizer and the food was AMAZING. I met Mikey and he was so welcoming. We sat had some food and music was playing in the background and we just loved the whole atmosphere. Definitely 5 stars. We will definitely come back again!! Thanks Mikey for making us fresh authentic Jamaican food!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  I've been a couple times. The first was for a chicken burger and the next was the jerk chicken meal. As both my meals suggests, this place serves both Jamaican and traditional North American fare.   The chicken burger was just okay. It was a breaded cutlet that was almost certainly from a frozen package. It was still quite cheap however, so I wouldn't chalk it down as a negative experience.   The next time I came was when I had the jerk chicken meal with rice and peas. Everything was very fresh, sizeable portions, and a solid jerk chicken meal. About the same affordable price as you'd get at various Jamaican places, but the dinning area here is better than most of those places.  Seems like a solid place for lunch if you're in the area and for pretty good prices."}
{"text":"Purchased the food here twice. First time chicken curry it was okay at best and the portion was tiny! The second time was mikes special chicken and rice and peas. The rice and peas were above most restaurants and the chicken was also very tasty. The problem was the portion was so small. Not a fan of restaurants that add pops in on a forced combo. It seems like what they did in the '80s and 90's. I prefer to buy my meal at fare price and drink my pop at home which I purchase by the case at 6-7 dollars and or  .24cents a can.   Bottom line is this place has to upsize their portions on the Jamaican style food and lower the prices on the American style. I also have seen their salads, They look like beds of lettuce with a couple small pieces of peppers.  For every customer that feels like they did not get the deal they would appreciate, you lose the customer. Lots of locals eat out in Brampton, this will lead to retention loss. If I was owner I would want less profit on single purchase but a larger amount of steady sales. Lets see how this one plays out. Going to be interesting to see how this story ends."}
