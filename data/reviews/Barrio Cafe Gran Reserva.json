{"text":"From the second you walk in it's something special. The attitude, the staff, the presentation is amazing.  Oh, the food is unique and awesome.  Thanks Phillip for a wonderful evening!!  One let down is ordered a top shelf margarita! $32.  Highway robbery.  BE CAUTIOUS!"}
{"text":"The food selections are limited, unless you are a fan of pork. Additionally, the entrees are significantly overpriced on all levels- taste, quality, portions and seating is to close next dining table."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to the quirky Grand Avenue neighborhood. Such a unique spot - from the historic 1940's storefront with dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows, to the colorful hand painted murals by local artists on the walls, the retro banquet seating, the rich handmade walnut bar, and sparkling clean kitchen. The food was fantastic, specifically the 9 course tasting menu, comprised of delightful and unusual ingredients and food combinations, with an array of tasty ground chile pastes and sauces. Everything is made with a goal of excellence - as well as the desire to showcase esteemed authentic Mexican dishes that are hard, if not impossible, to find locally. The intimate size of the location feels as if you have pulled up a chair in the Chef's own kitchen and been lovingly served her favorite dishes, with recipes passed down over the years and through the generations."}
{"text":"For my money Chef Silvana has done more for Valley food and art culture than any single person. Instead of resting on her laurels she's using Gran Reserva to push the culture even further. The art is amazing! Not just the art in the restaurant but the art throughout the whole neighborhood including the Sentrock mural across the street. The food is transcendent. Get the tasting menu and just trust that you're going to get Comida Chingona if Chef Silvana designed it."}
{"text":"Chef Silvana did it again! We are long time fans of Barrio Cafe and were blown away by Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva. It's Barrio Cafe, but even more elevated with the integration of many exotic regional Mexican ingredients that I have never heard of. The service is outstanding, the atmosphere is awesome and the food is the star. Best tres leches I have ever had. High fives all around."}
{"text":"Sad this was my choice to take my son to celebrate his birthday. Half of what we wanted was not available, and this was 7:30 PM. We ordered the beet salad, but no plates were given to us, given that the beets were chopped very small, they were difficult to eat and made a mess of my clothing. We were given bread plates, but no bread was offered, at time for dessert, there was no flan, our beer selection, Chupa Cabra, was not available. The portions were meager and unsatisfying, more the size of an appetizer."}
{"text":"A more elegant take on the Barrio's at 16th St. The best thing is that they take reservations. Menu is limited than the one on 16th St, but awesome food. Loved the food, the ambience, the  waitress and their presentation. i'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"What a terrific find. Delicious and sophisticated tasting menu (be sure to order that!) with Mexican flavors and ingredients, but not your typical Mexican recipes. A great surprise: the friendliest little restaurant in a nice welcoming neighborhood. Even got to watch see a parade go by."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience!  I decided to end the year at dinner with my girl and was extremely excited to find that the barrio cafe has branched out. What drew us here was the offering of a tasting menu. It is always great to experience a chefs desired progression of a meal. It is the closest you will come to being invited into their home, so to speak, and experience their craft.  The dinning room staff were warm and inviting.  The space intimate yet open (seating for ~18 +2 top at the bar)  The ambiance celebrated the cuisines culture. And the food was amazing.  Each dish was balanced, seasoned and cooked perfectly; complimenting the last, leaving us wanting more.  We opted for the spirit pairing (wine, beer, distilled all from Mexico) and were blown away. Never experienced wines from Mexico before, what we had were delightful.  If you love to experience artisans share their craft, you will not be disappointed.  If you view quantity as quality stay off yelp."}
{"text":"First visit and we were very pleased with everything can't wait until our next visit. The intimacy of the small dining area was unbelievable even with other patrons so close."}
{"text":"This place was rude and the bartender didn't serve a drink.  She walked away and never helped me and let someone who wasn't a bartender serve me.  I don't why she did to me but her name was Faviola Martinez."}
{"text":"This is the latest creation by Chef Slivana and similar to the original Barrio Caf√© but with a little more panache'.  Smaller, quieter space with white linen tablecloths and better silverwear.  In an old historic building with lots of charm this place is TINY.  When I say tiny, I mean there are probably only five tables for maybe 20 diners at the most.  You'd better make a reservation if you plan on eating here.  Lots of local art both inside and outside to look at.  So that is the ambiance.  The food is excellent as what you would expect from this celebrated chef.  Smaller menu than the original Barrio and includes a 6 course tasting menu.  Some of her best dishes are on the regular menu including the Chilies en Nogada and Pork Pibil.  Prices are slightly higher than the main Barrio and i'm guessing that is to make up for the smaller number of guests she can serve.  Drink prices are noticeably higher especially.  Philip was our server and he was charming and made us tableside guacamole (not sure this is the way he was supposed to make it but the guac wasn't chopped up like usual....just the sliced avocados with all of the other ingredients mixed in).  It was still delicious but made it harder to use a dip for the chips.    We loved everything we had and the chocolate dessert with Quaxacan chocolate and fresh berries and cream was heaven.  It was my birthday dinner so Philip bought us a Flan and it was way better than most Flan I have had....not a gellatanous glob, but a rich, textured Flan drizzled with just the right amount of sauce and topped with nuts.    My one complaint would be the air conditioning....it was extremely warm the entire time we were there, otherwise it was top notch and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Another great restaurant by Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza! The conchinita pibil was absolutely  divine! As was the pineapple tres leches cake!!! Some of my dining partners had the tasting menu, which they said was phenomenal. A must try! A great dining experience."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food.  Delicious, imaginative, remarkable.  I wish I could give a separate review for service, without lowering the food one.  Our courses (we both got the tasting menu) were hurled at us one after another as if the staff couldn't wait to get us out of there.  A few sips into our pre-dinner cocktail, the first course showed up, with wine pairing, and then the amuse bouche came.  Whah?  The amuse bouche should be served with the cocktail, and the first course shouldn't show up until the cocktail is done. We sprang for the wine pairings, we wanted those with our food, not leftover margarita.      For the rest of the meal, the second we stopped eating, the next course and wine arrived.  This is not the way a fine dining experience should be. You pay that much, the meal should be relaxed, paced so you have time between courses to digest a little, finish each wine, and talk.  The restaurant was not crowded, there was no one waiting, so no reason to rush us.  The poor couple next to us had the dessert menu laid on their table when they were not even close to finishing their entrees.  Message:  Hurry up and get out of here.  Also, the levels of heat, which we loved, killed every wine they served (or maybe there wasn't much to taste anyway?  We couldn't tell).  I recommend sticking to beer (or they should offer craft beer pairings!  That would be fabulous.).    If the pacing of the meal had been more professional we would have left crazy about the place.  Since I don't see other people complaining, it might have been an aberration---chef had a hot date that night?  But it kept our evening from being as good as the food deserved."}
{"text":"Barrio Gran Reserva is the place of my foodie dreams.  The drinks were excellent and our server, Miranda, was informative and helpful with suggestions.  My friend and I went with the tasting menu, and each item was as delightful as the next.  I will certainly return!"}
{"text":"An amazing explosion of flavors! Service was fabulous and food was magnificent! We had the mole negro enchiladas and the chile en Nogada! Not 100% original but surprisingly good! If you are looking to taste amazing food make reservations as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"Stunning.   This was the best tasting menu meal we've had in a long time.   The flavors were spot on, and built to a peak by the final course and dessert.   Don't be fooled by the portion sizes...you will be satisfied and very happy by the end.   I loved the attention to detail, balancing presentation with intense flavor.   This is the sort of cooking that breathes with the soul of the chef.   Do try the wine tasting pairing.   I was very impressed with the chef's selection of Mexican wines, from a pleasantly funky Chenin blanc to an unoaked Chardonnay to a gorgeous Nebbiolo...even a wonderfully floral and hoppy cerveza with the suckling pig course.   Service was terrific and pacing was perfect.   I'm in town for a month for work, and will definitely come back and bring friends.   I can't remember when I've last left a restaurant this happy."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing, innovative, and creative meal here. Top notch service by Miranda, amazing wine pairings, and a six course meal for 50 dollars. Every course was a new taste explosion. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! A very small privately owned business with a very creative spin on Mexican food. Not your typical at all with lots of seasonal options which we really enjoyed. The fare is tilted to Fish and vegetables but the presentation and flavors are 5 star. Reservations a must!  Our second time here the meal was fantastic the service was good but the food was very slow."}
{"text":"The tasting menu is awesome. The atmosphere is great. We enjoyed every second. Great place. Do yourself a favor and visit Grand Reserva"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our anniversary. Oh my it was the BEST meal I ever had. I have worked at 5 star resort and had several James Beard award chefs cook for me. But this was the best! The service was amazing. Our waitress, I think her name is Marissa. She described everything to the tee. Her recommendations were spot on! I love the ambience. It was great to meet Chef Silvana. She was so nice. I loved to hear her stories about the recipes she had found. I couldn't have asked for a more magical evening."}
{"text":"I had the best dinner here! Dining solo while on business and made a reservation for one. The service was impeccable. My server made me feel so welcome, and I felt like she genuinely took pride in whether or not I was enjoying my meal (which I was).   There is both a vegan and traditional tasting menu available. The traditional was ~$50. My favorite dish was the halibut. I would have been full with just the tasting menu, but I did have an order of the vegan enchiladas as well. For dessert, I chose the yam dish. I heart yams so much! Excellent way to end the meal.   The Sarano margarita was perfect, a spicy/sweet mix with great flavor.   I would definitely recommend this place for the food and service! The receipt includes a place to tip your server and a place to tip the kitchen, which I am not used to so just be aware!"}
{"text":"We were fortunate to try the tasting menu.   Every bite was sublime.   The service was personal and focused.  The atmosphere is intimate.  I can't imagine any better tour of flavors, prepared with techinical precision, in a warm and professional setting.  We were really impressed and so thankful to have had this experience."}
{"text":"My evening was incredibly special. The restaurant is small, quiet and beautiful. Our waiter was knowledgeable and extremely right on with recommendations. His wine and tequila suggestions were perfect. The food is very tasty and the guacamole is superb. What an amazing find, especially in a world of cookie cutter type restaurants."}
{"text":"Holy Crap!!  One of the best meals I've ever had.  Did the tasting menu.  Everything was amazing.  Server Phillip could not have been nicer.  Art throughout is special."}
{"text":"Wow, arrived on time for a 9:00 pm reso and was left to sweat on the street.  No chair, no water and no estimate when my table would be available. The greeting was and this is a quote \"We have noted your arrival time\". There were 6 other people waiting, on the street, outside.  Ouch. Left to a more professionally run restaurant."}
{"text":"Service: Impeccable. Prompt and attentive. A lot of pride has gone into the food, the decor, the music, the drinks and it shows.   Food: impeccable. Pan seared halibut plus a starter salad for 19. Smh. The quality of the food. The combinations. I can't say enough about the food. I am going to dream about this halibut dish. One of the best I have ever had.   Ambience: highly impressive. Bistro style type setup with either old school R&B, I'm talking chi-lites, delfonics type music, or older Hispanic music.   And a super bonus to me was that the Chef came out and asked about meal, told us about their other locations, and the tasting menu.   What a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant with amazing food!!  I booked my reservation weeks in advance to secure a Saturday evening spot.  We were seated at the 2-person bar, which is their version of a \"chef's table\".  What a great experience; I recommend the bar if you can be seated there.  The bartender was amazing and we interacted with many of the servers throughout our meal. Everyone was passionate about the restaurant and the menu and shared that with us. They also have an impressive drink menu and I highly recommend the Fenix!  (I brought a picture of it posted from Yelp!) As others have said, definitely try the tasting menu. I can't say enough good things about it! The pork belly (with a homemade organic corn tortilla, avocado and peanuts) and the lamb chops were some of the most delicious food I've ever had. The entire tasting menu was creative, flavorful, exquisite. Please try this spot - you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic margaritas and an excellent selection of mezcal! The food was amazing as well. For an appetizer, we had their guacamole (made table-side) which was simply the best I've ever had. For the main course I had pork belly while the others in my party had steak (cooked to perfection) and a squash dish. Each meal had a unique combination of favors that none of us had experienced before! Also, the service was excellent... overall a must-eat!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here a few times, the guacamole is TO DIE FOR. Who ever thought of pomegranates in guacamole; I want to know because we have to get married. Enchiladas are my favorite, the drinks are always outstanding, service in ALL Barrio locations have always been a pleasant experience. WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR!?"}
{"text":"Update 12/1: we've been fully refunded.  Update 11/23: wait....another charge of $160.66 in my bank statement. Not sure what's going on here on top of the incorrect billing. The reimbursement below was reversed. I see 2 charges now. So over this BS.   Update 11/22:  We were reimbursed for the billing mistake. Saved us $321. Thank you Barrio Gran reserva. I do love a good drink however not $321 worth!   Update 11/19: barrio gran reserva reached out. Since this was left unresolved from last night when we initially tried to clear up the miscommunication we thought we were left to deal with it. We spoke with Marcos today and we're told that the extra charge will be removed next week. I will absolutely revise this review and turn a negative into a positive.    Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva goers BEWARE.   We set up a reservation for my mom's birthday on 11/18/2016 at 8pm. We grew up going to Mexico City as kids and we wanted to take her somewhere where she could connect with that at some level. The food was delicious.   The only kicker that I feel so wrong about was how our waiter Marcos completely blindsided us. When presented with our drink menus we were going over our options. We each ordered a drink. One of us orders \"a glass of herradura\" on their menu it states a glass for $69 and a glass for $9. We pointed at the glass for $9. He says a name and he brings out what we think is the $9 glass. When the bill comes we see we have a $276 charge for herradura. If he was about to charge us for the $69 glass of anything I think it his responsibility to inform us about this. I would have politely declined and said I want the $9 glass please bring the $9 glass. Instead he charges us $69 a glass. Our grand total including his tip that he factored in was well over $600 (total in tip it was at least $120). We are by no means herredura connoisseurs and wouldn't have been able to taste and think \"oh, this is the wrong one.\". We tried to dispute it there, he appeared very nervous when we approached him because he knew what he did was wrong. We weren't about to argue about this during my mother's dinner.  I feel so shocked, cheated and ripped off. This wasn't fair. I've never experienced this before. I hope we can come to an agreement. Right now we are waiting to meet with Marcos our server, so this can be resolved in a fair way."}
{"text":"Small restaurant where we felt like we were welcomed into a family home for dinner.  We are at the chef's table (party of 2).  We were lucky to get the spot on the first Friday of the month with art shows in the area.  The Lowrider Margarita was the perfect classic marg; a wonderful exhibit of the classic cocktail the world first fell in love with.  The Guacamole del Barrio was chunky and full of flavor.  The enchiladas and the steak entrees were fantastic.  This place lived up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Went to Barrio Cafe for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience! I visited with my girlfriend and luckily got a table despite not making a reservation (which is highly recommended). We were definitely intimidated by the menu, which is mostly in Spanish, but our server was extremely helpful and the most polite. His colorful use of vocabulary and attitude made us comfortable and glad to be there. The dishes themselves were delicious and had plenty of flavor and texture. During our dinner a live musician came in and serenaded the restaurant with Spanish melodies that set the mood and livened up the night. Overall I would highly recommend Barrio Cafe for the person who wants to expand their culinary palette and enjoy a nice evening in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A for making an vegan tasting menu. C- for the taste.   Hands down the guacamole was the best thing we ate during our trip to Phoenix. But the rest of the meal was a letdown, especially at such a high price point. The duck carnitas were rubbery, not crispy. The cheese enchiladas were almost empty and swimming in mole. The roasted vegetables were the same on every plate we ordered, and we ordered a lot. The steak did not taste high quality. We skipped dessert after such a disappointing meal.   An extra star for a fun interior."}
{"text":"The food is unbelievably delicious and beautifully presented at this very special restaurant. The staff could not have been warmer or more generous with their time and presence. We came in a little tired and hungry and left nourished, excited, and surprisingly elated. Phoenix is very lucky to have the Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva."}
{"text":"I'll admit I was pretty bummed when Bragg's Diner closed at this location awhile back.  But I was equally intrigued when I heard Chef Silvana of Barrio Cafe took over the building with plans to deliver another of her unique Mexican inspired experiences.  My friend wanted to take me out for my birthday so it was with great enthusiasm that I chose this place as my birthday dinner of choice.  Make sure you make a reservation in advance on OpenTable by the way as this place is small and gets busy during the dinner hour.  We got here right after 5 on a Friday when the crowds started to roll in.  The building has gotten quite the upgrade from the Bragg's days.  The interior has the quintessential feel of a fine dining establishment (even moreso than Barrio Cafe's flagship on 16th Street).  Various Mexican inspired artworks line the walls, but overall the feel is that of a formal dining experience.  The place seats no more than 15-16 with great views out into the neighborhood and a truly intimate setting.  Some of Gran Reserva's menu mirrors what you'll find at Barrio's flagship including their famous Cochinita Pibil, their Chiles en Nogada, and of course their out of this world Mole.  But unique to this location is their tasting menu.  For about $40/person you get a six course meal with small helpings of whatever the chef feels like making that week.  For an additional $25, you can pair your dishes with drinks also chosen by the chef.  Its my birthday, so I went all out with the tasting menu and drink pairings.  The presentation, service, and taste of the dishes was similar to how I would describe my various experiences at Kevin Binkley's restaurants.  Absolutely phenomenal flavors, innovative techniques, incorporating ingredients native to Mexico (some of which I'd never even heard of until tonight), and a deep attention to great service and making sure I understood the full depth of each creation.  I especially loved the drink pairings.  The white wine that came with my first course and the beer that was paired with my fourth course were especially awesome.  And again, many of the ingredients and I believe all of the drinks I had were from Mexico.  Really opened my eyes to all of the treasures of Mexico's culinary scene that until now I thought Phoenix had largely figured out.  The Mexican wines and beers alone had me craving more.  So in summary, if you're coming to Gran Reserva, get the tasting menu.  Pretty much everything else they serve you can get at Barrio Cafe's flagship location on 16th Street and Thomas (which I highly recommend trying if you've never been).  But the tasting menu experience I had is specific to this location.  The staff is excellent and the building is a beautiful example of the potential the Grand Avenue corridor holds for the future.  Chef Silvana Esparza is already a legend in the valley culinary scene.  She hit a home run with Barrio Cafe and she's hit a grand slam with Gran Reserva.  Silvana felicitaciones por un trabajo bien hecho"}
{"text":"I feel very fortunate to live in a town that has really great Mexican food.  In Phoenix, we are able to pick and choose.  If I want street tacos on the cheap, I can go to one place, tamales at another, regional someplace else.    For something really special, however,  there's Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva.  The tasting menu is an experience anyone who has any interest at all in eating food where the soul of the chef is both visible on the plate and savor-able in every bite, you must try Gran Reserva.  I have had the tasting menu twice now.  The second time, I was a bit sad that the menu had changed, but was quickly won over by the delicious offerings on the new menu.  Each of the six courses (both times) was fabulous.    The staff here is wonderful, enthusiastic and knowledgable.  At the end of the meal you will feel well fed and well taken care of.  Every detail at Gran Reserva demonstrates Chef Silvana's attention to detail and careful consideration of the the whole dining experience.  I love the small compact nature of the space, the art and white table cloth dining room. Gran Reserva also offers Chef Silvana's signature plates from her other projects as well.  If you can, plan ahead and make reservations.  Expect a dining experience you will not soon forget."}
{"text":"We had the sampler menu.  It was 9 courses of awesome. Stimulating savory sensations with each dish.  Small space, limited seating. Too early to tell what wait times will be since it's reservation based.  Sans reservations, they fit us in with only a 30 minute wait, which turned out to be well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The $40 tasting menu is one of the best deals in Phoenix. Fantastic service and good food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Mexican fusion cuisine! New, beautiful, hand painted walls, white table cloth, cloth napkins- absolutely beautiful! The corner at Bragg's Pie Factory makes a a light airy intimate setting. Now the drinks; I had 2 cocktails, tequila based. The first was the Lowrider. Much like a margarita, top shelf tequila. The second was The Flaca, also top shelf tequila with agave nectar and Cointreau- also excellent! The food, they brought us sliced French bread and a garlic based spread which was delicious. We ordered Barrio Guacamole with chips. Very simple, very good! Nice chunks of avocado in fresh pico de gallo. We then split an entr√©e. I wanted Pico Poblano which is pan seared halibut in a poblano chili. We decided on Poblano Nogalo which had chicken, walnuts, raisins and more in a poblano chili with an outstanding sauce with pomegranates. This dish was unspeakably good, I've never eaten Mexican food like this before. The service was superb! Chef Silvana- well done!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicate and delicious. Small menu, but full of flavor bombs. Attentive service, cozy seating, rock star bathrooms. Going more than once during my week here: it's that good, people!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere,  small and intimic restaurant.  Amazing margaritas and wonderful ribeye steak."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar, ask for Miranda (not Phillip)  A very confusing phone call - no tables but I can definitely sit you.  Firstly, not $$ when it's $17 for a margarita.  Came in, wasn't offered to sit in the bar which is in the kitchen, which looked awesome - the people 5 minutes after us got the kitchen seat.  Jammed in the corner the waiter was \"ok\" until you saw how much the other waitress loved what she did, gave amazing explanations of the food and the history, and told tons of entertaining stories.  When we tipped appropriately for our service received ~10% he immediately said \"let me get the door for you\" and I think kind of hissed at me.  Fancy food that is hit and miss, but the service is more extreme.  Sit at the bar and ask for Miranda; I'll go back on Phillip's night off."}
{"text":"This was one of the most incredible dining experiences I've ever had. We came specifically for the vegan tasting menu and we're blown away from the entire evening. The service is phenomenal and the waiters and waitresses explained everything from the cultural origins of each course to the flavors you would experience. We can't wait to go back and I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful new restaurant on the outskirts of downtown Phoenix!  I was eagerly awaiting the opening of the latest iteration of Barrio Cafe and quickly made a reservation the day they became available.  We stopped in on Saturday night and were seated at a two top in this super quaint restaurant.  Our server was incredible and truly walked us through the entire menu, so we made educated choices.  I selected the agua fresca of the day (so flavorful and truly addicting), the tapcuba (wow, just wow!) and the tres leches to wrap it up. We will definitely be back and next time will enjoy the five course menu...sounds to die for!"}
{"text":"Pretentious place except the location and the wall art by Tato Caraveo. Mediocre \"high end\" Mexican food at ridiculous prices. Not sure why the hype around that chef. Same thing with the original barrio long ago at Thomas and 16th. I get the idea behind mixing elements from central, south Mexico, Oaxaca and DFederal, but cmon 4 tiny finger sized seafood flautas covered in heavy creamy sauce for 24$?! Funny all my well traveled Mexican friends are referring to all Barrios locations as \"comida por gringos\""}
{"text":"This place is excellent ! Phillups is unbelievable waiter. Three of us had the tasting menu and it was great. Flavor and more flavor."}
{"text":"I don't have words to express how special this place is. From the stunning food, to the warm and knowledgeable staff, to the beautiful art (all by local artists) -- it just kept getting better and better. A destination spot, for sure. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"When I heard of another Barrio opening in 'the barrio' of central Phoenix in June, I could not wait to try it! I even got my Hulu out and re-watched Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives episode of his visit to Barrio Cafe and refreshed my memory of one of the most fabulous AUTHENTIC Mexican meals outside of Mexico that I've ever experienced. Last weekend I decided it was time to try Barrio Gran Reserva for brunch and once again, I was blown away by the authenticity and flavor within every bite and dish we tried. This Barrio is smaller than the Barrio Cafe on 16th Street with a handful of tables. The neighborhood is well, what the name suggests: in the Barrio. The unique wedged shaped building is in the historic Braggs Pie Factory, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, although the pie factory is sadly gone, Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza has turned this cute crisp, small white building into a mecca for her amazing iconic dishes. You will find a smaller menu here and only two seats at the bar, that DO give you a full view to the open kitchen. Sit at one of the tables and have a view of downtown PHX. She also offers a Menu de Gustacion, or tasting menu in the evenings that a wine pairing can be added to. I was so impressed with Barrio Gran Reserva. The service was amazing and very attentive. We started with the Bloody Maria, made with the house made Bloody Mary mix and tequila; and the Fenix, a smoky mezcal and light refreshing OJ, and herbs such as basil, make this drink perfect for the hot summer days in PHX. Next, we ordered the housemade guacamole... pomegranates give this chunky, spicy guacamole a perfect tang and sweetness! Brunch has a limited menu, and again, a difference from the Barrio Cafe versus here is the limited menu. No worries, the food is amazing! You won't be disappointed! We ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, five rolled enchiladas stuffed with various cheeses and an amazing rich creamy tomatillo sauce and topped with a over easy huevo! Mmmmm... I do love a Mexican breakfast! So yummy and rich, this dish can be shared. I took some of the guac and added it and made it perfect! My husband had the Bistec con Huitlacoche y Huevo.. an ample serving of perfectly grilled rib eye steak, corn and Huitlacoche , (yes! You should def be a real foodie and Google that!!), served over a corn tortilla and topped with an over easy egg. So much , my husband who can put it away, could not finish this huge meal! Now let's discuss this drink menu! There are so many drinks on the menu! Very innovative and amazing ! Our waiter advised if I found I didn't like what I ordered, he would get me a drink I did like! I love that type of service. He let us sample the Bloody Mary mix first too. We also had a Cafe con Leche.. hand poured at the table with steamed milk. I loved the Mexican cafe I had before at Barrio Cafe and this cafe did not disappoint either. I can NOT wait to come back and partake in the tasting menu one evening soon! Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza , I am truly a fan of what you have accomplished!"}
{"text":"Amazing, why? Service, food and atmosphere- please take time and go here. I was traveling on business from Philadelphia and seek out places just like this. Only open till June or Maybe July and opens again in the fall, Due to heat of the summer and they design of the building. This amongst other really cool 5 facts (chef/owner is a 5x James Beard nominee) is why you should stop in. Have a tasting menu both vegan (I eat meat) and non in addition to ala carte. This is Mexican food on a whole another level!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for my birthday and we were blown away! I had the Cochinta Pibil and my husband had the Chilies en Nogada and it was some of the best food we have ever eaten. The staff was incredibly friendly and could even speak to the cool artwork throughout the place. It is small, and intimate, and is a great romantic spot"}
{"text":"Ok.... For years I have told my wife that eating skin and fat will kill you...,. Today, after 30 years, I now want to die from eating fat.. chicharron in this special mole' is so fricken awesome I almost wished for a smoke post meal.  Crazy good paired with a tempranillo and nothing else..  Service and recommendation.. flawless"}
{"text":"Per usual the Barrio name is on point. I had tried going to this location a few times before but it was always full. Excited to get a reservation tonight!  We did the prix fixe menu with five courses. Wife did the vegan (so great to have this option) and i did the standard. Each course was so well thought out with flavor combinations that brought each piece of the dish together perfectly. My favorite was the diver scallop second course. Sliced and served in a ceviche style with fresh chips. Drinks were well crafted with fresh ingredients that exposed the flavors into a rich experience. Look forward to returning again soon."}
{"text":"Of course, it was my birthday dinner. That said, I could not be more enthusiastic about the service we received at Barrio Caf√© Gran Reserva. Miranda took excellent care of us. She carefully and articulately described the new wants is in flavors of every dish and also about every beverage. She is intimately familiar with the menu and her enthusiasm and passion for the work that she does shines through. Our cocktails were excellent, their flagship guacamole was prepared at our table, and our meals were spot on. We took Miranda's suggestions and ordered the halibut and also one of the enchilada dishes. Both were prepared perfectly, well garnished, and ample.I am so sorry that I don't recall the name of my delicious birthday dessert. It was a perfect chocolate, yet spicy, yet creamy delight.  It's easy to park in the lot across from the restaurant or on the street but one word of warning. - Make a reservation. If you want access to their lovely five course tasting menu, you need to have a reservation. And believe me, I'll be going back to try that one!"}
{"text":"Came in with 3 colleagues and all had the 5 course sampler. Everything was okay, i think just too sophisticated for my pallet. Also, nearly everything had cilantro, which i have a dire aversion to so that was my fail for not telling them to hold the cilantro after seeing it the first time. The cod sample was good, but the duck had so much sauce I couldn't taste the duck itself. My favorite course was the dessert."}
{"text":"The Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva has reopened and is New Again and PRETTY DARN AMAZING! The James Beard Nominated Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza offers the most unique and WONDERFUL menu. Many of the ingredients used come from Mexico and not all but MANY VEGAN items are offered. Whatever you try vegan or non-vegan the food is DELICIOUS and is lively with lots of FRESH flavors. Not all but some of it is spicy and it might be a good idea to let your server know about your heat preference so the kitchen can serve you what you want.   On my visit they offered two tasting menus. One was vegan versions of the other menu and optional Mexican Wine Pairings. They were flexible in our selection and allowed us to mix it up. They also offer ala carte options of vegan and non-vegan.  The Chef welcomed us in and made us feel welcome as well as our amazing server Philip that recognized us and also welcomed us back. He did a phenomenal job of explaining the menu items to us and we decided to do mostly the main tasting menu with wine pairings.  I imagine the menus offered will change with what is in season so you might get to try different things than what I had.  The first dish was sort of magical and hard for me to describe with attractive vegetables and produce. ( a scallop or not) It was spicy and sweet and so interesting. It's unlike anything I ever had anywhere...but it was full of flavors and delicious!  Another course was made with Delicious Sweet Grilled Pineapple, Unusual Cheese, A Leaf, 14 chile oil. Very yummy!   We also had a Taco Course that I keep thinking about.....Everything about it was expectational.....and the Smoked Sweet Potato Mash was stellar. Often I don't like smoked things but this was carefully made and delicious..........  Halibut Dinner was mouth watering with a delicious char. Loved the cactus fruit salsa and beans.  At this point I was pretty full but both the desserts was also incredible so I had to indulge.   The meal wasn't just great it was EXTRAORDINARY!  This truly was among the BEST DINNERS I had all year!   I do note that this is a very small but beautiful restaurant and you need to make a reservation. Parking is easy either on the street or in a good size lot next to the restaurant.  If you are a local or a visiter to Phoenix this is a must do!"}
{"text":"What a great and unique place.  I love the ambiance from the painted murals on the wall to the music.  I could have hung out for hours drinking their margaritas and just enjoying the feel.  It took me back to a cool little cafe in South America.  Food was on point as was the service.  A new favorite spot. Highly recommended if your looking for something original and real."}
{"text":"Classy interior, well-poured margaritas, a menu that reflects high-end Mexican with a local flair. I'd like to rate them five stars but the service was officious and a bit condescending. They also gave us conflicting accounts of whether they took reservations -- over the phone it was \"no,\" but then we were hassled for not having them when we walked into a nearly-empty restaurant at 5:30 p.m. Perhaps it's just a glitch in their opening process."}
{"text":"I did return to this restaurant after about April,2017. I did not find the atmosphere to be very inviting. The chef Silvano did come out and say hello  To many of the guests, however she actually just walked by us when the Waiter brought out a birthday desert for my guest. I was surprised she did not acknowledge us or the birthday ..rather than just walking by ....the halibut with the salsa topping was mildly hot and was loaded on the side with Beans and a \"Mexican green, that tasted like an odd spice (bitter) the beans were excessive and the halibut was dry and overlooked.. overall, this Place lacks the high quality for what the price is.."}
{"text":"I was a frequent visitor when Bragg's Factory Diner occupied the premises.  While I was sad to see my regular haunt disappear, I was encouraged to learn that Barrio Cafe had taken this small space so I looked forward to a meal.  After a day of meetings, I rushed over to Grand Avenue and appeared on their doorstep without a reservation.  Considering the few tables here, I was grateful they found room for me.  Unfortunately, small is a theme here as the portions are exceedingly spare.  If I had ordered two of everything, I would have been content.  Indeed, the tres leches cake was the size of a small post-it note.  Will I return?  Maybe.  The food was very good.  The fish alone was prepared to perfection.  I'll just have to make sure that I have a meal before I walk in the door so I don't leave hungry."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday dinner tonight, and I was really looking forward to trying Chef Silvana's food. I recently became vegetarian again and was thrilled at the wide selection of vegan and vegetarian items. I had a stuffed chile dish that had the fluffiest creamiest sauce I've ever tasted, and it was vegan. It was amazing. I had a spicy margarita to drink. I absolutely loved it, but it is super spicy! I have a high tolerance to heat and it had me drinking water between sips. For dessert we had the tequila chocolate mousse, not vegan, but so good! There is a vegan chocolate cake available, but I couldn't resist the mousse. The service was on point, Chef Silvana even came to our table and chatted with us which was pretty cool. Ambiance is upscale but comfortable, and the art and decor is perfect. We will for sure be back, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for awhile. So, for our 11th anniversary I made reservations and we made the haul into S Phx. When we arrived we were told it would be awhile before our table became available. I looked at an empty table for two and thought \"why not seat us there\"  but hey, it's their restaurant. 20 min later they sat us at that very table. Trying to create an air of exclusivity is just lame. 20 minutes in and only had water at the table. Drinks finally came and we placed our order. The tasting menu takes 2hrs so we ordered off the regular menu. The atmosphere was ok and our server was gracious but an hour later still no food. When it came it was good but not fantastic. We are not the type to complain, we rolled with it. Just keep those drinks coming. Overall it was a mediocre experience. Not worth $170 bucks."}
{"text":"One of the sexiest most delicious meals I've ever had. Tasting menu was delectable, the staff was as lovely and delicious as the food. Rather than do the wine pairing, we asked for a premium silver tasting menu of tequila. Barrio Caf√© has never disappointed, and this restaurant is so charming and perfect in every way, that I find myself having a crush on the chef just because she such an EPIC bad ass.  I have friends coming in from all over the country, as we are in a food lovers group. We all cook and feel as if we do relatively well in our own right.  This restaurant is a dessert to people like me, where food means more than just filling my stomach.  Sexy love affair.  Brava!!!"}
{"text":"From the call to make the reservation to the welcome on arrival, the amazing decor the flawless service from Philip to the out of the world food"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a delicious meal at this restaurant which is only 1 week old.  I ordered the Chiles en Nogada (chicken, apples, pears, apricots, pecans in a poblano chile, with a walnut cream sauce sprinkled with pomegranate seeds & cilantro).  The different flavors blended well.  My boyfriend had the Jaiba y Camaron which was also delicious. It contained a lot of shrimp & crab meat and the corn tortillas tasted superb.  For desert we shared the Flan and it was big and the best I've ever eaten!  Our waitress was very helpful and our food came out quickly.   The atmosphere is nice.  It's a small restaurant but we didn't have any trouble getting a table at 6:30 pm on Friday without a reservation.  However, I think wee were lucky.  They only have about 30 seats so make a reservation.     The murals done by Lalo Cota were beautiful!    My only negative comment is that the wooden chairs seemed out of place and did not compliment the beautiful murals and decor.    I gave this place 5 stars!  Compliments to the Chef!   Update 10/1/2017 Celebrating tonight!  We had the privilege of sitting at the bar in the company of the kitchen staff, servers, & the chefs.  We ordered the sampler meat dishes.  Delicious!  The courses:  watermelon/goat cheese, scallops with mango, cooked cheese wrapped in spinach,  duck taco in mole, halibut with rice, the food in delicious sauces, margaritas, and 2 Phoenix  cocktails, wine, & desert.  My descriptions does not do justice to the flavors.  You'll have to see the menu to understand the indescribable delicious flavors.  Go to Barrio Gran Reserve & appreciate the heaven on earth."}
{"text":"the hours are wrong.  only open for lunch on weenends.  went for lunch on tues so no review."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant while I was on a quest to find a new and interesting restaurant. I would have to say this restaurant is a gem. Initially I was hesitant on going because of its location. It's in downtown Phoenix and located in a slightly worrisome part of town. However, upon arrival, the restaurant itself is very nice and is surrounded by some nicer, artsier areas, which mostly eased my safety concerns.  Being in Phoenix, we live in a grid system. Most restaurants are the shape of a rectangle. This place, at least the front seating area, was in the shape of a triangle. Two of the three walls were from ceiling to almost floor, which allowed for the romantic evening sunlight to shine through. The restaurant itself is small, but its decor was romantic and the atmosphere intimate.  My party was seated immediately but given the restaurant's small size, a reservation might be ideal at a busier part of day/week. Service here was FANTASTIC. It is better than most of the fine dining restaurants I've been to. From the young lady who seated us to our server, everyone was very helpful and informative. Our server knew the menu and everything off the top of his head. He gave us very good recommendations and was very helpful in answering all our questions.  They have both alcohol and food. I tried the Fenix margarita. It had a very distinct flavor due to the Diablito Mezcal but was a very good combination of fluids, nevertheless. For food, my friends and I shared the chips and guacamole. It was different in a sense where the avocados were chopped into chunks rather than mashed. I am more accustomed to mashed guacamole but the difference in presentation was simply that. It was very tasty, and I enjoyed it very much. The best part of the guacamole was when our server brought all the ingredients to our table and prepared the dish right in front of us! For my main dish, I ordered the Cochinita Pibil, a slow roasted pork dish. It was very flavorful and the portion size was large enough for two. It was slightly dry, but everything else made up for it. For dessert, my table shared the flan, tres leches, and another dish I cannot remember. My favorite was the tres leches. It has a very strong and distinct cinnamon flavor, which, in my opinion, made the dish. Presentation of all the dishes was simple yet made a statement.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and will be making my way back. It's worth a try if considering!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is most lovely. The combination of colorful and bright murals, the high ceiling and the pervasive whiteness evoked a feeling of a Mexican dream. Seating is very intimate, and make sure to use your discrete voice as it would be easy to eavesdrop on other conversations. Service was just as lovely and attentive.   I adored the guacamole! Our server brought out a bar cart of various fixings and created the dish in front of us. I loved the pop of sourness and brightness of the pomegranate seeds. The tortilla chips were the best tortilla chips I have ever tasted - you could taste the freshness of the masa in each bite!  My friend and I both ordered the pork in smoked mole (I don't quite remember the exact name), served with squash and carrots. Unfortunately, I found this dish just OK. The pork belly came out in big chunks with (albeit beautiful) of a char. However, the pork belly lost their juiciness and were tough and rich that it sat quite heavy even the morning after. I really enjoyed the mole, though. I would have liked shredded pork smothered in that mole, rather than the tough pork belly.   I would return for the guacamole and to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Can I just tell you how amazing the staff is here! My mother-in-law wanted to eat here while visiting from Kansas City, not realizing that we needed a reservation. They totally set up a table for 8 for us (which was no small effort) even though we didn't reserve.  The food was SO good. I had the Chiles de Nogada. A poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, apple, pear, apricot and pecans. In a walnut cream sauce. It was delicious. And then of course Flan for dessert.  It's a tiny place, but I highly recommend it for a special evening out."}
{"text":"Summary of a 3pm fixed price menu lunch: ($42 per)  Service: excellent with a very knowledgable staff. For a time we were the only table occupied and the staff was very attentive and offered some good advice on drinks. They seemed to be overstaffed as the lunch progressed yet it was a fairly long endeavor of about 2 hours. We may have arrived in between shifts which may explain the rather drawn out timeline in between courses.  Food: very, very good. Again, we opted for the fixed price menu of which I have attached the photos here. I will say that the fish course was slightly dry but had complex flavors. Pork belly was delicious but may have been over cooked and provided an almost glue-like sticky skin. Crisped queso and the lamb course were by far my two favorites. For a fixed price tasting menu, the portions, except the lamb, were too small. Presentation of all courses was outstanding as was a clear explanation of what we were about to indulge in next.  Drinks: had a mezcal based margarita that was very good albeit tasted a bit weak/watered down. They also have my favorite Victoria beer that was nice and cold.  Interior: this was the old Bragg Pie Factory place and they did not expand the interior. It is very small and quaint inside with a very fresh and clean feel. Authentic Mexican music was at a good volume for background effect.  This is an exceptional restaurant in an up and coming area on Grand Ave. Chef Silvana has rolled the dice on opening up a trendy/pricey little restaurant in an artsy, eclectic area of downtown and I think it will be a hit.  Overall score: 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Oddly wedge shaped restaurant with no more than 8 tables. Spanish guitarist playing enthusiastically upon entry and all evening. White table cloths and incredibly friendly greeting. A small two person bar in the back has a wide assortment of mezcals and tequilas for all price ranges.    The table side guacamole was delicious. Prepared tableside it comes with the usual ingredients but the addition of pomegranates really was a nice touch. The chips may have been home made but it was much earlier in the day. It was missing some warmth and crunch.  A beet salad with greens and feta fared well.  Fresh if not very inventive.   They mean well and have promise, but they fail in execution. One of us had the tasting menu and the rest a la carte. The tasting menu looked great but came out incredibly slowly. The a la carte dishes came out near the 3rd or 4th course of the tasting menu - about an hour and a half in. The fish special which should have been a nice seared cobia instead was overcooked with zero skin. Utterly disappointing.   I'm all for spending long hours over good food but consistency, attention to detail and service are paramount. They have more work to do."}
{"text":"Miranda, is amazing. I mean, I fell in love with her just because of her passion. The food, is as passionate as she is and that is all you need to know."}
{"text":"We only had one night in Phoenix and we managed to get a last minute reservation for the last seating at Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva. Not familiar with Arizona *at all,* we knew about it through the recent James Beard announcements and decided to splurge for the tasting menu. We arrived right on time after a 25 minute walk from downtown and we were promptly seated. This place is intimate if you haven't already gathered from the photos. We were one (two-person) table of five parties eating at 8:45 on a Sunday night. The prix fixe was a no-brainer and all-in-all it was one of the best meals I've had in the past few years. The portions are generous (it is an incredible value -- you would never have a meal like this in LA for under $70/pax) and each dish had its own unique mix of taste sensations. Everything seemed intentional, well plated, and so very thoughtful. I had the best piece of halibut that I'll ever have...and the hoja santa quesadilla was so ridiculously spectacular and unique that I'm still thinking about it. Drinks were a bit pricey relative to the food costs and did not blow me away but no matter. The food more than makes up for any deficiencies (i.e. the server -- could not understand a word he said and I'd wished we had better way to remember what we ate). Just an FYI, there is a separate tip line for kitchen staff. Despite having eaten around (the world and most major metropolitan areas in the US) I had no experience with this and had already left a 22% tip in the first line. I wasn't quite sure what to make of the second kitchen tip line and panicked, leaving nothing additional."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and i am so happy i did. They have an entire vegan menu which is the reason we came. The cocktails were strong and delicious. Everything i ate was like a party of flavors in my mouth. I can't believe no one in my circle of friends has mentioned this place before. Highly recommend!! Thank you Phillip for the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Fancy locale! Small on the inside, I'd recommend reservations especially during busy hours! The Jamaica is homemade and super tasty! I had the huitlacoche, which was something different to try, and pretty cool to know that a local restaurant has it! They served pressed coffee, my fave!!"}
{"text":"Beyond awesome in every way. Treat yourself to a meal here. We lunched late on a Sunday and everyone else in the very small dining room was a regular. I imagine you absolutely need a reservation for popular times - so glad we were there at a quiet time. Love this place - can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying the food was amazing. It was what was expected from being told from friends and reading reviews. We came here to celebrate mothers birthday. Everything was going well until the miscommunication.    What is disappointing is the bad the business. I understand the process of up selling- but you should advise if there is a big price difference. We pointed to a list of Herradura. $9 difference to $69. For someone who isn't well versed in spirits- how is one to know? Especially if the server knew this was our first time coming to this restaurant.   We had an issue that we addressed with our server Marcos. That same night- error wasn't addressed properly. We go in the next day- to try and address this issue- we were first told \"we can't help you with this issue as we are super busy\" we were then told to come back later. My sister went in later to get this resolved. We were then told that this refund would be issued the following week....   The following week comes and we are charged each an additional amount. At this point I feel so disappointed ever coming here- This has just gone on too long and should not require numerous visits and emails and phone calls to resolve a miscommunication. I have never in my life have dealt with something like this when it comes to dining.   Beware of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that wants us to, by sheer force of will, make us, will us, to love them. I, for one, did not. Love the place. And the fact that there isn't an email/contact for any of the Barrio Cafe's on their websites is troublesome, just like they don't want to be contacted.  That is not the way a PROFESSIONAL service business operates responsibly.   These guys talked about \"flavor\" but I thought the flavor was lacking in the food that we ordered (never mind that they pushed way too hard on the tasting menu for $50 or $60).   The only thing I've ever eaten from Barrio Cafe was a doggie bag of guacamole from the 16th St. location. It was absolutely delicious, probably the best guacamole I've ever had. This guacamole wasn't really guacamole; it was more of an avocado and pomegranate salad. The avocado was left in chunks, not mashed, no tomato or tomato sauce, interesting, yes, and absolutely nothing like the doggie bag guacamole I recall. Could the recipes be that different between the two restaurants?  I ordered a shredded pork dish that, while a very generous portion, was good, not great by any means. My dining companion ordered the Chile relleno, which looked beautiful but was rather unspectacular in every regard.   I watched the chef shows and I think most common mistake that I see is the chefs not tasting their food. There's no way these people are tasting this food and patting themselves on the back.   HERE'S THE KICKER: we had enough of each dish left over to take home. So, if it's \"all about flavor\", how could the busser have put both entr√©e dishes into one doggy bag like it was some stew or goolosh, or a f-Ing buffet!  Why would I want to reheat two dishes, totally unrelated, now piled together?  Not \"mom-and-pop\", UNPROFESSIONAL!  You go. I'm not. $77 plus tip."}
{"text":"The entire experience was phenomenal. The food was perfect, I especially enjoyed the guacamole."}
{"text":"So good! We tried the tasting menu which changes frequently. The margaritas are on another level. We will frequent again."}
{"text":"The food is interesting , the building is super artsy and fun to look at all the different murals and creativeness on the street ... Driving by I would never think this is a \"fancy\" place to eat .. It's casual but the food is pricey and and creative .. I had no idea what anything was in the menu which made it hard to justify spending 30$ a plate , so thank goodness for Yelp and people taking pictures ..The taste was good , ingredients were fresh .. It did take a LONG time to get our food , to the point we were sitting there bored . It's a different flavor of Hispanic dishes , don't expect enchiladas with rice and beans here ."}
{"text":"Barrio Caf√© Gran Reserva is essentially a scaled down version of their flagship 16th Street Barrio Caf√©. I use the term \"scaled down\" because, not only is the size of the restaurant smaller, but the menu doesn't offer quite as many options for those familiar with what can be found at the original.  When I reviewed the original Barrio location, I gave it an underwhelming three stars. Most issues stem from overpriced food that seems to cater more towards the urban crowd that think paying upwards of twelve dollars for churros is \"normal\" in today's food landscape.  This second location is a bit different. Unlike 16th Street, they do take reservations here. In fact, they're strongly recommended, as the seating is pretty limited. My girlfriend and I were barely able to be squeezed in on a Thursday evening out of sheer luck.  The menu seems to provide a selection of popular entr√©es that Barrio fans will be quite familiar with. The bread with salsa-styled spread has been carried over. Additionally, they were trying to sell us on their 44-dollar tasting menu, but we decided against it.  Oddly enough, many items we've tried at 16th Street were conspicuously absent at Gran Reserva. There were no enchiladas suizas (only mole) for dinner. Forget ordering standard tacos. Those overpriced churros and equally overpriced, but decent, pastel de chocolate, were also nowhere to be found.  I convinced my girlfriend to order their Caf√© con Leche, which is essentially just that. Someone was boasting about how they pour it at your table. Yeah, just like they poured my soda. Who cares? Be careful, as my girlfriend was asked when she wanted the server to stop pouring the leche. Uncertain of what would be considered \"enough,\" she left it to the server to decide. The end result was a glass that was only halfway full. Ouch!  My girlfriend opted for the Chiles en Nogada, while I decided to order the Tacuba. Before they were prepared, we were provided with miniature salads. A nice touch, but its chili paste resulted in the salad having a bit too much of a \"bite\" for our tastes.  The gap between salad and entrees took forever, to the point where I thought they forgot about us. Perhaps more focus was placed on the tasting menu tables. Both entr√©es, which were alarmingly small, were just okay. We liked the Tacuba a bit more than the Nogada, which seemed to be in desperate need of some cheese or a heartier meat. Both were fairly small entr√©es given their asking prices, which is consistent with what you've come to expect from Barrio. Don't come here with the anticipation of leaving with leftovers. You won't - and it's also likely that you might still be hungry when finished.  For dessert, we ordered their tres leches. At eight dollars, the damned thing was practically the size of one of Bimbo's mini mantecadas (muffins) topped with a bit of espresso and leche. In fact, it could easily pass as one. Another reviewer compared it to the size of a post-it note, which is no exaggeration. I mean, could they seriously be anymore stingy?  Honestly, I don't know. I'm all for paying a little extra for places that serve superior food. Barrio is one of those restaurants that I've always, deep down, wanted to desperately like. Unfortunately, I maintain my stance that it's nothing more than high style (and price) with lackluster execution. And for that, aside from their ultra-cool interior designs, I can't really say that it's a place I'd get the urge to revisit.  All sizzle and no steak."}
{"text":"Had an A+ dining experience. Sat at The Chef's Counter which enhanced our dining pleasure. Recommend the fixed price dinner and drink menu. One dish was better than the next. We loved this restaurant. Have a feeling that we will be talking about it for a long time. Too bad we are leaving Phoenix tomorrow. Definitely will be back next year."}
{"text":"Made 6pm reservations 3 weeks ago.  Hostess called to confirm the RSVP an hour prior.  After waiting 40 minutes, still no table.  No apology or follow-up phone call from restaurant. (Too add insult to injury, I had a gift card as a part of a package I purchased in an auction for a non-profit... so I paid an extraordinary amount of money for a disappointing service)."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience at Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva this evening. The restaurant had such an amazing spirit. The servers, drinks, food, and atmosphere were so lovely. I really appreciated both servers' insight on all of the dishes, background on the restaurant, and passion for the food they were serving. They also seemed to have an excitement and pride in their new vegan menu. Such an infectious excitement for the food!!  I felt right at home... they had a flavorful, soulful vegan tasting menu. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a unique restaurant with heart for vegans, vegetarians, or meat eaters."}
{"text":"Very good food but so expensive, $22 enchiladas...and the line for the extra tip for the kitchen staff? If we're paying $100 for the a la carte meal, that's just rude. Pay your staff appropriately in line with the price of the bill!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely unbelievable. If you are lucky enough to sit at the chefs table - do it!   The steak was, no joke, maybe the best I've ever had. Now, I know what you're thinking, more hyperbole. Which, ok, that's a big deal to say, but I've eaten well and can honestly say it's true.   The cocktails are excellent, nice depth of flavor and generously strong.  Outstanding service and if you're cool, you get a chance to talk to the chef, sous chef and severs.   One last tip, whatever you do get the carajillo. The best dessert/after dinner drink around.   I don't know who these people are leaving negative reviews, but don't be swayed by them. This is in my top two restaurants in Phoenix (and I used to get paid to review restaurants, so this is genuine)."}
{"text":"Good service and good food.  I paid about $14 for a bacon, eggs, and potatoes breakfast.  For bread, they served something toasted with a guacamole spread, topped with pomegranates.  It had a nice flavor.  I have no real complaints.  The dish was attractive and all of the flavors worked well together.  In fact, the bacon may have been some of the best I have ever had.  I definitely recommend visiting Gran Reserva."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the US.  Seriously.  I have never been to another mexican restaurant that even compares to the experience at grand reserva.  Every time I'm in phx it's a must go to on my list.  Great options for vegetarians, delicious novel entrees that you can't get otherwise, and service that it's impeccable.  The drinks are huge and strong, the guacamole has pomegranate , and the enchiladas de suiza (during brunch) are incredible.  The space is super intimate and perfect for quaint date nights or small groups.  Not the best for kids since the space is small and the food is gourmet.  So much love for this spot and WAY better than all the other barrio cafes around town (phx has several but the menus are different)."}
{"text":"Loved this place before wasn't sure on new opening amazing new menu with vegan menu too. Did tasting menu it's the way to go. I'm so happy to se them back and chef healthy again"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon. Old school latin music played overhead which was very good. The art and the look of the place is small, but good. The waiter and staff were very friendly and I enjoyed my waiter's unique mustache and hair. I asked the waiter to ask the chef I make for me whatever he wishes as I couldn't decide off the menu. The bread and salsa that came out as an appetizer was great and I had water. The chef decided to make me something off menu and it turned out to be a very delicious dish called guacamole enchiladas! I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wow what an awesome place!! Very personable. Chef makes everyone feel like familia and as if she's cooking just for you!! She has a huge heart and it shines through in her food. Keep up the work!! Viva Mexico!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must go! My husband and I invited my parents to a 5pm dinner. He and I arrived very early but were quickly greeted by the most gracious and friendly host Phillip. He tended to our every need while we waited, and made conversation. By the end of our visit (3 hours later) he felt like family! The margaritas were refreshing and different from the usual chain restaurants most of us are used to. The dinner menu offered a variety of flavorful dishes, and a tasting menu paired with wines and a special cerveza. My husband opted for this choice, and he was extremely happy. Each dish was a generous serving, and the flavors left us all wanting MORE! We will definitely be back and look forward to seeing Phillip again!"}
{"text":"Having been a patron of Barrio Cafe for years, we found Gran Reserva to be a great delight. We have recently adopted a vegan lifestyle so the meal was quite a treat. From the amuse bouche to the postre to top it off , we were in heaven. The various courses were beautifully seasoned and presented. The wine pairing was spot on. The waiter Caesar was very informative and passionate about the food. We will definitely be back and bring the family to enjoy the offerings of an inspired chef."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for Saturday, I'm glad I did, the restaurant is really small (10 tables maybe). I was politely greeted by the hostess who had our table ready. Sat down in a small little table, felt as I if I was a part of the other tables conversation. Also really uncomfortable for my fianc√©e to squeeze through to sit down. Anyways, I had their Michelada and my fianc√©e had the \"Low Rider Margarita\". Really good drinks, the Michelada is really spicy, so keep that in mind.   We were offered bread and some sort vegetable spread which was a little bland for our taste. Next was a house salad which was pretty good, comes with blue cheese and pomegranate seeds. The salad tastes fresh and the flavors were well balanced.   Our main entrees were presented very elegantly. I had their Enchiladas de Mole and my fianc√©e had the Chile en Nogada (stuffed poblano pepper). The enchiladas are a bit small, but rich in flavor due to the Mole sauce, not very impressed. My dish could have accompanied with a side of beans or rice m, but that's just me. My fianc√©e dish was not what she expected. The poblano was stuffed with mangos, walnuts and cranberries and little pieces of chicken... not exactly a traditional Mexican dish. Lastly we tried their Tres Leches cake. A bit dry, could have had more leche or cream.   Overall experience was good. Good service and good ambience but not happy with the food choices we made. This place seems to have a twist on some of  the traditional Mexican dishes im used to. So... if you're looking for traditional Mexican food this is not the place."}
{"text":"The enchiladas were amazing and the flavor was so powerful! Highly recommend this for a shrimp and crab lover. It is a very small restaurant, but worth the wait and price. I've been screaming about this place to anyone who will listen!"}
{"text":"The uniqueness of this menu was so refreshing.  As we waited with excitement for our food, our cocktails were served quickly: 3 different styles of margaritas, all delicious.  The spinach, pomegranate, and soft cheese salad was simple yet impressive. My family, a table of five, shared guacamole, soup, and two entres: enchiladas de mole con pollo & cochinita pibil.  We finished with flan de mi mami! Everyone was full, happy, and impressed. My mother said it was the best beal of the entire trip. I wish there was a Barrio Cafe in San Diego.  Felipe, our server, took such good care of us. He was attentive, friendly, and helped make really good recommendations. We loved the paintings and set up of this small space; it was an intimate & elegant dinner."}
{"text":"Great little unassuming spot on the corner. We loved the tasting menu. We sat at what we think is the best spot in the house, right at the bar perched above the kitchen, in the room where it happens. Service was wonderful, food was outstanding and the music was bumpin! A must try when you are in town."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to meet for lunch. It was awesome our server Miranda was so nice and just added to atmosphere."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  4.5 stars but showing 5 because the service was just so darn good.  Really outstanding.  Upscale Mexican food.  Don't let sticker shock set in because you know now, this is upscale Mexican.  Came in for lunch and the space is really bright and quite nice.  Meals come with bread service and a salad.  The spread that comes with the bread is great.  Really tasty.  The salad is good, fresh, nothing special.    We ordered the house guacamole and the posole to start.  The guacamole is very fresh, more akin to an avocado salad.  Chunks of diced avocado, chiles, onion.  I'm allergic to pomegranate so they added citrus instead to add some freshness and acidity.  Pretty darn good.    The posole is amazing.  Lots of pork, roasted green chile, it is deeply filling and satisfying.  We knew we ordered too much food at this point because the posole, which we finished, was so darn rich and filling.  I would get this again and again, even in the summer.  For entrees, ordered the enchiladas de mole and the halibut in poblano crema.  The enchiladas aren't your typical rolled enchiladas.  These are folded with a little cheese in the middle.  But these aren't the star anyway.  These are served with the mole of the day, in this instance, mole colorado.  This was a great mole Oaxacena.  Nutty, slightly sweet, bitter notes - it is complex and delicious.  I'm excited to go back and see what other moles are offered.  The fish was a little disappointing.  It was juuuuust a tad overcooked.  And underseasoned.  Even dipping the fish all into the poblano crema (which was subtle and delicious) didn't overcome the lack of flavor.  It needed a little something extra, not even necessarily salt.  But, all in all, an excellent meal, despite the mediocre fish.  I'm more a fan of regional Mexican than my wife is, so at the very least, I'll be back to try new offerings on the menu.  Oh yeah, I got a Bloody Maria.  It was spicy enough.  That is all."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe the gastromic journey that I took tonight with the tasting menu...it was amazing, playful and left me satisfied.  From the jicama salad, to the scallop, to the halibut to the lamb, to the chocolate mouse and berries it captured the senses and played with my eyes. Chef Sylvania has truly upped her game and created a artistic palette for the downtown cuisine....we are coming back, next week too soon?"}
{"text":"Magic!!! This was the best birthday dinner. The flavors were just absolutely amazing. I had the Tucaba they were like little cheese and spinach filled tacos with some kind of beautiful sauce. So great!! I also had the posole verde... I don't know what kind of witch craft this lady does but it was the best thing I've ever eaten. Just an overall wonderful experience. The guacamole was unusual..UNUSUALLY AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Warm Bread with Pepper Spread Barrio Guacamole - thick-cut with Pomegranate, Onions, Cilantro, Tomato, Pepper  Posole Verde - Pork, Hominy, roasted Tomatillo and Poblano Soup topped with shredded Cabbage, sliced Radish, diced Onion and served with Tortillas de Nixtamal Enchiladas Suizas - Imported Queso Menonita filled Nixtamalized Corn Tortillas topped with a delicate Tomatillo Cream Sauce then topped with an over easy Egg Torta Poblana - Spice rubbed Chicken Breast topped with caramelized Onions, roasted Poblanos then finished with a Crema de Pinon and Queso de Cabra  Flan de mi Mami - Traditional Flan topped with Cinnamon, Pecans and Crema de Kahlua Tres Leches - Berries, Fresh Whipped Cream, Toasted Pecans  Adding one more to the family of restaurants owned by Silvana Salcido Esparza, her original Barrio Caf√© perhaps Phoenix's most famous restaurant with an offshoot at Sky Harbor Airport and Scottsdale's Barrio Queen also held in high regard, it was at the recommendation of a local food-writer that a party of three sat down at Barrio Caf√© Gran Reserva, a bright white space serving upscale, modern-Mexican cuisine.  Situated in the Bragg's Pie building, historic signage still present outside the wedge-shaped dining room on Grand Avenue, it was with warm greetings from a slender server with glasses that the group was greeted moments before 12:45pm reservations, a sizable four-top along a wall nearest the bar offering full view of a space surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows decorated in bright colors and shadowed depictions of a bucolic Latin American lifestyle.  Without doubt a different scene from the eclectic 2002 original, and equally unlike the trendy Queen, Barrio Caf√© Gran Reserva sees Chef Esparza focus on a more engaging concept including a tasting menu that was unfortunately unavailable on the year's final day, a brief brunch menu instead offered alongside some of dinner's a la carte options comprised of both entrees and shared plates.  Beginning with housemade Bread and chilled Pepper spread, those longing for crispy Tortillas well-advised to invest in tableside Guacamole that eschews oversalting in favor of diced Vegetables served alongside Pomegranate Seeds in a chunky green puree, a sharable bowl of Posole Verde rang true with the rich sapor of Offal alongside cubed Pork and tender Hominy in a broth of roasted Tomatillo and Poblano Peppers, though the menu-promised Corn Tortillas were nowhere to be found.  With no Mole or Cochinita available at this hour, the brunch theme more centered around Fish or Eggs, course two consisted of five Cheese Enchiladas bathed in a vibrant Cream Sauce alongside a sizable Torta Poblana, the thinly-pounded Chicken Breast picking up great flavor from Onions and Peppers plus Pine Nut Cream and mild Goat Cheese.  Veering tradition with desserts, the Tres Leches Cake neither too soggy nor artificially sweet beneath Berries, Nuts and dollops of Whipped Cream, Silvana's \"Flan de mi Mami\" comes across as a thick Custard with air-pockets almost as large as Tapioca pearls in some spaces, the addition of Cinnamon and Kahlua almost giving it a Tiramisu accent and besting previously tasted versions of the classic by several degrees."}
{"text":"We're the server less concerned with impressing us with how sophisticated this good Mexican eatery is, she might have done a better job. All Gringos are not equally uninformed. So, how was dinner? Good, but not great, at least not for the price. Many of the dishes are standards from the Bario Cafe and could use updating. The guacamole at table side is a bit old. My duck was plated beautifully but could have used more - meat, veggies, and sauces, my wife's poblano was no better than she makes. My biggest problem was the coffee, a decent cup but lacking in anything to stand out. There's the problem; this is a restaurant that claims to stand out but doesn't quite do the job."}
{"text":"We love Chef Silvana and all her creations, so we were excited to check out Barrio Gran Reserva!  The location is great, I'm so excited that Grand Ave is getting awesome local businesses to bring life back to the area. The building is the old Bragg's Pie Shop and GBR does the landmark justice.   The tasting menu is really innovative and the best way to try a bunch of different tastes. Everything is executed beautifully, and the posole and tres leches cake are delicious!!"}
{"text":"So incredibly good!  Beautiful presentation.  So creative, every detail from the atmosphere to the very last bite.  The vegan options are so incredibly good.  This is absolutely our favorite restaurant in the valley.  We really hope this place thrives on Grand Ave for many years to come!!  We love Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza, we love MIranda, Phillip and the entire crew!!  Go there!"}
{"text":"Friendly chef great food ! Very personal service !! Great fresh food made with love . They made it special for us by bringing us chocolate mouse for our friend with bday cake and candle !! Delicious !! Thanx Peter for a great service !!"}
{"text":"I recently moved into the neighborhood and on my first walk around the area, I came upon Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva and KNEW it was something special.  It was a few months before I tried their food (a special occasion with mom and grandmother visiting)... and I already cannot wait to return!! I'm dreaming of the enchiladas tacuba!  Our server, Miranda, was also extremely friendly, real, helpful and fun!  Thank you Miranda, Chef Silviana & staff. It was a dinner to remember."}
{"text":"Our meal was absolutely incredible. Happy to support an amazing local business with their finger on the pulse."}
{"text":"This is the top of my favorite restaurants not only in Phoenix, but above anything else I've had around the world. Do yourself a favor and try the prix fixe menu paired with the wine tasting. You get just enough food, high quality favors, and a great variety. Every ingredient is carefully prepared and makes the food is superb.   My favorites dishes were the aguas chiles, and the grape leaf wrapped in cheese. The 7 chile oil is to die for. I literally wanted to take a bottle of it home.  To drink, we did the prix fixe tasting pair menu and the Santo Tomas Tempranillo was a great starter wine. I recommend starting with the Siete Leguas Blanco. One of the best tequilas I've have in a while, smooth, light and something you can sip on your whole meal.  Miranda was our server and she was bar-none. An expert on every dish and ingredient and quick to make a recommendation no matter what your taste. She knew the food and drink menu better than anyone anywhere else.  All in all kudos to Chef Silvania, Miranda, and the entire staff at this place. Already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews aren't especially my thing, but this place is magical. I dined here twice on a four day trip and it is the best Mexican restaurant outside of Frontera Grill I've experienced in the US. Service is outstanding. Highly recommend tasting menu if your only visit (value is amazing) and shrimp & crab if second or third -- tomatillo crema reduction captures everything at which we fail in home kitchens. Mezcal cocktails are superb. An American treasure."}
{"text":"It was tough to decide between the 5 course sampler of picking something specific, but this time I elected for the Cane Aseca  and everything about it was amazing. Being a party of four allowed for us to each share a little of everything we wanted and it was absolutely fantastic! The dessert was a little something to be desired, but the guacamole is a MUST !!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to take my in laws to a nice dinner. What we found by far exceeded that. This experience was amazing. The food, drinks, ambiance was 5 star. Our waiter Phillip truly went above and beyond his duties to show us a great time. I highly recommend this diamond. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!  Even with the high rating and great comments, we were still surprised by the quality of this restaurant.  The service was impeccible (Miranda), and the food matched that same high bar.  The Sous chef stopped by after our meal which added just the right touch of hospitality.  We will be back for the tasting menu with wine flight.  Top notch!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food hands down that you will experience in Phoenix. Not your typical joint, a unique restaurant that takes food up a notch or two. I recommend the dinner pairing with wine. ;)"}
{"text":"The customer service is horrible, not young people friendly, if you want to be in a room that only fits seven tables and sit around old white people go for it. The website says that you don't have to make a reservation so my boyfriend and I went and the lady told us it would be about 40 minute wait time which is understandable for a small place and even after that she had the audacity to tell us that they take long to prepare the food as if she did not want us to stay there. After that we just left, never coming here again. If I could give it less than one start I would."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing!  Amazingly attentive service! We sat at the bar and Nick was our Mixologist/Server. This man not only knows the Menu, but he KNOWS his Tequila. On the menu, it has wine pairing.. No thx, pair my plate with Tequila! The drinks were amazing to taste. Meaning, I got what I want as did my Queen.  Amazing Atmosphere! The music was multicultural: Cumbias, salsa, merengue, bachata, and some reggae ton. Not sure if it were a station or mix but it was great.. Oops, Amazing,  Amazing food! We did the sampler style of the appetizers! Much like the Avengers Movie each Star got to shine. For the main course, we split the Crab and shrimp enchiladas... OMGEZZY! Best Ever!  I need to go back to experience the steak."}
