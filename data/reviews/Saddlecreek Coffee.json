{"text":"Customer service was awesome. Great homey feeling with welcoming interior. Crepes- yum, but my breakfast crepe had obviously been nuked as the interior temp was sporadic with some bites being only like warm. Got a free pastry by checking in with Yelp. My friend was glad his was free bc it was stale. Mine blueberry muffin was really good. Not too crazy busy. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really great place for kids. My 3 year old loves playing with the kitchen and toys.. They were clean too. Coffee was good and breakfast burrito was decent. I feel they could use an egg upgrade though.. They reminded me of something subway would use."}
{"text":"Got the best tasting espresso I've had in the longest time. My super early work meeting all the way up north was a headache. I stumbled upon this place by just finding my way out of a residential community. The breakfast burrito could've been a bit better, but it filled me up which was the main factor of ordering it. I saved this on my app and wouldn't mind having another stop."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little oasis in the desert in search of iced coffee and a little relief from the weather. We walked in and were immediately welcomed by the owner presumably. I ordered an iced almond milk latte with sugar free caramel and my boyfriend got the chicken Caesar wrap. My coffee was SO delicious and smooth unlike some other almond milk lattes I've had. It was sweet but not overly sweet. The wrap was fabulous as well! Simple and fresh but very tasty! Wonderful customer service, tons of gluten free options, and a great place to sit back and enjoy some air conditioning on a hot day!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Cozy in the winter and cool and comfortable in the summer, we love the lunches and breakfast muffins are to die for."}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere and kids corner.  Coffee good too!  Biscuits and gravy was not good, in my opinion.  I was disappointed in my breakfast.  I will be coming back for coffee.  I will not be planning a breakfast here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Rustic, but clean. Great outdoor seating. Came in open mic Saturday to see two girls playing guitar, another day to see a scrapbook club gathered. Coffee is great, service friendly, bakery items are yummy and fresh. Have not tried their other food because I don't eat sandwiches very often."}
{"text":"I prefer to support local business as much as possible and I love this place. Great coffee, friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere. I am a creature of habit so I get the same thing everytime I go so I can only speak to the panini breakfast sandwich, it's so good! They have a little play area for the kids with books and a mini kitchen which is a fabulous idea. You can meetup with your friends there and the kids can keep themselves busy playing. I def recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoy supporting this local business. The owner and staff are very friendly. Try the biscuits and gravy or the pastrami sandwich!"}
{"text":"Brought my parents for lunch, turned out to be a great choice.  I had a Gobbler turkey havarti sandwich with avocado, Dad had Cordon Bleu wrap, Mom had Tuna meltini sandwich.  Fresh and delicious food.  Dad enjoyed fresh brewed tea and we also enjoyed lattes.  Owner was personable and helpful suggesting what to try on our first visit there.  Loved the southwest/cowboy styling and great furniture choices.  We'll be back when we visit North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped by this lovely place for some iced coffee today, delicious!! The owner was super friendly and introduced me to the toddy iced coffee! I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Rule number 1 of food handling, do not touch your nose or face and then make food. Blonde guy here is wiping his nose and handling food. Disgusting."}
{"text":"What a great find!! Great food- breakfast and lunch, and you must try the cold brew coffee!"}
{"text":"I gave this place several tries as it's in my neighborhood and not a chain. I have never gotten food here except the turkey gobbler which was OK. Today I watched them microwave these egg looking discs to put on the breakfast burrito and panini. I can only assume the \"chorizo\" and \"bacon\" were microwaved as well. If you are going to serve food and not just beverages, it's your responsibility as a business owner to put some effort into it. We as consumers are purchasing your product and a microwaved egg is not how I would think you want your brand represented. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great, coffee, food and most importantly service. They have a kids corner, so a great place for moms as well :)"}
{"text":"Had both the breakfast burrito and the biscuits and gravy. Both were delicious and the staff was friendly and professional. Would recommend to anyone up in the Tatum Ranch/Carefree/Cave Creek area."}
{"text":"Love coming here to meet a friend and  catch up over a cup of iced green tea or with the family for a relaxing weekend breakfast and game of checkers. Kids look forward to their smoothies. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Service with a smile! :-) and delicious breakfast options (I'm sure lunch is equally as awesome, just haven't been in for lunch.. yet!) Love the farmhouse atmosphere as well. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Saddlecreek Coffee for the first and last time. The food was nothing special but what ruined the meal was that the floor was being mopped while customers were there eating lunch. The smell of the disinfectant, the noise from the chairs being moved around, and having to walk over a wet floor to get a soda, was absolutely ridiculous! I was waiting for the person mopping to ask me to lift my feet so she could mop under my table. Seriously do the cleaning after you close!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and friendly folks working there. Highly recommended, better than Starbucks!"}
{"text":"We came to saddle creek for the first time after finding out it had just opened about a week earlier. The staff was very nice and interested in detailed feedback about the service and perception from customers, showing that they value input and the opinion of their patrons. I would rate the quality of the ingredients in the food served as high, fresh and savory. Simple dishes and excellent coffee at prices comparable to chain businesses. It is always great to support local independent businesses and because of that, along with the great service, we will return. Also...one of our friends that came with us had one of the fruit smoothies and described it as \"the best smoothie I've had\". His opinion tends to lean towards being very critical of food and drinks, so that definitely impressed me and made me seriously consider that smoothie as an item to try next time I come back."}
{"text":"I woke up this morning randomly craving a breakfast burrito. The craving has been satisfied! So good! Sipped on a refreshing iced coffee, as well. Jordan and the staff are super friendly and attentive. What an excellent way to start my day:)   I'll be hanging out here more often!"}
{"text":"They have a Snickers Iced Coffee that is to die for. Four stars because I don't quite understand why they use the system that they use for loyal returning customers as well as for checking out the paying customers. I'm sure it works great for them but to me it seems like organized chaos. So I skip all of that now, for my own peace of mind, and just make sure I have cash when I visit."}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to have a friendly, well-run local coffee shop in the Tatum Ranch area. We went early on Sunday morning and there was a steady stream of customers, many of which already seemed like regulars! The owner {or who I assumed to be the owner} was greeting everyone and was so nice. He even brought fresh water out to our dog when we were sitting outside enjoying breakfast. We ordered paninis {one ham and one bacon} and I would definitely order them again. Fresh and flavorful. We also had a drip coffee and an indulgent white chocolate mocha, both up to par with other coffee shops.  I hope this business continues to thrive. Stop in ASAP! We can't wait to try the sandwiches and salads for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this new NON CHAIN coffee shop and restaurant. Spacious, comfortable with outdoor seating and delicious coffee. The owners and staff are super friendly and quick with orders. I can't wait to try some yummy nibbles on the menu. It looks like they have a good selection of lunch and breakfast items as well as fresh sweets things! The horsey theme is definitely a plus and fits right in to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A nice spot to enjoy a Sunday morning cup of joe. Inspiring quotes and welcoming baristas make Saddlecreek Coffee a favorite for me. Conveniently located so in and out is not a problem should you need to grab and go.  A five star \" rich and delicious coffee shop\" review for Saddlecreek Coffee."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood coffee shop. Always run into a few friends when I drop in. Good for coffee but really great breakfast and lunch items also. Free Wi-Fi a plus!"}
{"text":"Cute little play area for the kids!!! I can actually enjoy a latte with my toddler happy!"}
{"text":"I am extremely impressed with this new, local coffee shop! First off, the coffee is amazing. When I walked in I was warmly greeted by the employees, and the owner introduced himself as well. This place doesn't lack in customer service!  They also have a cute little \"kids corner\" that your little ones can play in while you drink your coffee or have a bite to eat. I can't wait to give some of their food a try. Biscuits and gravy! Paninis, sandwiches and salads as well. And of course, food and drink options for your little one."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Ham breakfast panini and it was awesome! Fresh ingredients and perfectly cooked. I don't know if I would come here when I was in a hurry, but I'll definitely come again. Friendly service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has amazing savory and sweet crepes.  The chocolate muffin is perfect.  The oatmeal is Modern Oats, and the mix in the water but it's a good brand and you know what you're getting.  I would have given this place 5 stars but I don't like loud Techno music at noon on a Saturday at a coffee shop."}
{"text":"This new coffee shop has the best coffee ever!  Cute decor! I go here a couple of times a week and the staff and especially the owner are the BEST.  Reasonably priced.  Has wonderful pastries, sandwiches and salads.  A BIG PLUS for this area.  I HIGHLY recommend you make the trip, it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Finally!! A local, good quality, coffee shop for cave creek! Absolutely love this place. It's very clean and fun environment. Perfect to get a coffee or even lunch at during a work break. The staff is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I love this little place!! I've been here a handful of times and it's delicious every time! The turkey gobbler is my favorite, I add cucumbers! The sandwiches are always very fresh.  The best part about this cute little place is they have a kids corner where my daughter can play and enjoy her lunch while I enjoy mine!! The kids meal is half of a sandwich with juice and an applesauce pouch. Perfect!!  Love the little face lift they gave the place recently! I highly recommend this place for a quick little lunch if you're in the cave creek area!!  Also I'm an iced tea fanatic, theirs is delish!"}
{"text":"I adore this coffee shop. I first discovered this gem in December when my niece had a small choir appearance. From the outside, it could be easily missed. It is tucked into a strip mall. However, the inside is perfect. The space is large, well decorated and has several areas including a room that can be reserved for groups as well as an area for kids that has plenty of toys and even its own TV. There are comfortable chairs, tables and booths.   I started coming here more frequently lately. The staff is always warm and welcoming. They greet everyone with a genuine smile. Not only do they have your typical coffee shop fare, they also have a great food menu. The best part is that they offer all of their crepes, sandwiches, and paninis gluten free (i do not know if they have a dedicated gluten free area in the kitchen). their gluten free crepes are awesome!  At my last visit, I accidentally ordered the wrong crepe. I went back to the counter and apologized, and said that it was my fault and that I would like to pay for a new one. The staff was adamant and sincere about making me a new crepe at no charge. The crepe, of course (the chicken supreme), was phenomenal, and disappeared quickly. I already loved this place, but now I love it even more due to the superb customer service."}
{"text":"Food is good, the coffee not so much. If they stick to a restaurant that'd be ideal but given that it's called a coffee shop I would expect more. Last time I pour mine out it was so disappointing but don't let that deter you from the food menu"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Saddle Creek since they opened. I've been though the ownership change and remodeling. And it has never been a disappointment. I love the atmosphere of the shop, the teas, coffee, and pastries. Once I mentioned how much I love lavender flavoring in a white mocha.. the next week I went in they had ordered a lavender syrup! I finally can get my lavender white mochas!  That shows some awesome attention to detail. They are always willing to share a favorite drink or a favorite change on the menu. The new crepes are awesome!! I consider everyone there a friend. And I will always be a faithful friend of Saddle Creek for years to come. Y'all are the best! Supporting the local shops is a great thing to do. And the have definitely earned mine. :) Much love to my SaddleCreek Coffee Co. Family!!"}
{"text":"New owners. They got rid of the booths and updated their coffee selection. More changes are in the works. And it's all women owners so a great way to support a women-owned business! Still 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT new coffee joint in Cave Creek. The coffee is great and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I will definitely be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"I arrived during their hours and they weren't open.  Idk if it's Yelps fault on incorrect hours or the store's, but either way I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of coffee drinks and contemporary concoctions Good pastries and grill food as well. Of course wifi. All in the middle of horse riding territory. Great place to kick-off your spurs and talk about your morning ride."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! We would go during the week, but it is out of the way unfortunately. So, we choose to come on the weekends, and we love it!  The service is always very friendly. We sit at the bar most of the time, but they have couches, chairs, booths, and tables to sit at. There is also an area for kids to play in, which is very awesome for the parents that visit here. Their WiFi is free, so its a great place to work if you dont work in an office. There is also close bicycle parking, we actually just leave ours on the sidewalk since it is a safe area. The people that frequent this place are always nice, and I often see groups meeting here.   We have only had their breakfast burrito, and it was pretty good. Going to try other food next time. It looks like they have a bigger lunch menu than breakfast, but like I said, I have only tried the one thing.   Overall a great coffee shop, we will be back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Great environment to enjoy a coffee in the morning. The coffee is reasonably priced and it is good! They also have a lot of options for wraps and crepes."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee shop in Scottsdale. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and delicious, and the new addition of Dapper Doughnuts is a nice touch. I am consistently blown away by the breakfast burrito as well as their omelets. This spot is a must try."}
{"text":"I just found my new morning Coffee shop and it's right by my house at Tatum and Dynamite in Cave Creek. I was on my way to Ace Hardware when I noticed a Coffee shop had opened up right next door, So I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. When I walked in the front door I was greeted by a cute little boy that gave me a Saddlecreek sticker and a friendly young lady at the front counter that took my order on a really cool IPad device. I order the Mocha and the man behind the counter started making it right away. The friendly guy from behind the counter brought me my Mocha Coffee in a matter of minutes and introduced himself as the Owner. The Mocha Coffee was better than than the Starbucks that I usually go to and much faster service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Saddlecreek coffee is a nice local spot for coffee and lite food options and pastries. They don't open until 6am, which is after I head to work so I rarely get to stop there on the way out. (BTW, they don't have a drive-thru) I couple of times I have scheduled coffee meetings there and those we fine.  The staff is friendly and usually quick to serve.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee, service, space and I will be back! Really can't say enough good things about food, coffee and service!! If you want a great place where you will come back - go here!"}
{"text":"Had their chicken salad sandwich today.  The bread was the end piece and stale, couldn't eat the crusts.  It was just a lot of chicken with bits mixed lettuce and very few cranberries.  The last time I ate there the sandwich was very good and I expected the same today.  If this was my first time I would never return and never recommend this place.  I may try again at a later date, but this won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"The food was great and they have gluten free bread.  The locally owned restaurant was extremely clean and the owner and staff were so friendly. I would certainly make an effort to stop by and have a great lunch."}
{"text":"A nice place to have a small meeting or work solo.  There is also a separate conference room partitioned off from the main room with sliding doors (that have windows).  It has a large table that can seat 8 with ease and a big screen TV positioned for half the room to view it with ease.  I had the nitrogen coffee.  It was quickly prepared and tasted nice.  The staff and other customers were warm and hospitable.  They have listed a breakfast and lunch menu.  Although I didn't order any food, the orders I saw for other customers looked delicious.  As a customer traveling with a service dog, the staff was also very hospitable for her.  I recommend this shop for anyone wanting a semi-quiet meeting place or to work alone."}
{"text":"Took the gf out to breakfast for a nice break from work.  The staff is so friendly and makes you feel at home. Biscuits and gravy are so delicious.  Also the chicken salad sandwich is a must try.  Finally a local joint with good food and service. Will definitely be a frequent stop for us."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have breakfast  everything is good  love it , and the service fast"}
{"text":"Great little local coffee house!  My dirty chai was tasty and I enjoyed the chocolate cheese muffin (could use a bit more cheese though).  Husband's veggie crepe seemed like it was going to be a bit on the dry side but the crepe was just moist enough to make it work."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite coffee place and oh boy do we love our coffee.  We make it a family affair and we meet friends there whenever we can.  The coffee, iced tea and specialty coffees have not disappointed.  We love the breakfast sandwiches and the Pumpkin muffin is out of this world. So do yourself a favor....... get over to Saddlecreek and get your coffee on!"}
{"text":"For a treat, try the pumpkin drizzle muffin. Yum!"}
{"text":"Satisfying sandwiches, crepes, and coffee in a very nice setting with a big kids area. I came in for lunch with some friends, and the places was full of moms with their children. The kids area is great because all the kids run over there, and there are lots of toys to keep them happy and occupied. I enjoyed my Mediterranean wrap - nothing fancy or extra special, but everything was fresh and tasty. I was surprised that for being such a kid-friendly restaurant, there are only two high chairs in the entire place. Service was on the slow side, but it was busy and there were only a few people working. Definitely recommend for people with kids in tow!"}
{"text":"First time and here and had a very good experience. For starters they get their coffee from elevate which I like so good start. Had several different items amongst the family. The kids enjoyed the crepes and was nice that you could substitute any crepe on the menu to a kids selection. The wife also did a crepe and enjoyed it very much. I did the burrito with chorizo and was very good. The burrito was full of goodness and was tasty. The prices were very reasonable as well. It was nice have a kids area where they can play while the parents enjoy their meals."}
{"text":"This place is great!   We were there for lunch today and noticed they have redecorated - it was nice before - but we really like what they've done.   We've had their breakfast pannini, salads, sandwiches - all are very good.  The service is wonderful; always friendly.  The place is clean and inviting.  Corner spot for kids to play - we've never seen more than 1 kid there, so it is not noisy.  And free wifi for adults.  Good coffee - good food - friendly service - what's not to love?   We are very happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Impressive! Service, drinks, food, and vibe were all spot on. I'd highly recommend this local coffee shop/cafe!"}
{"text":"As I write this review, I'm enjoying an extremely tasty iced caramel macchiato after having sampled, with my wife, three different amazing pastry items. We have enjoyed coming here lately, as it is less than a mile from our house, but that wouldn't matter if the place wasn't good. Fortunately, it is good...very good. The coffee is from well-respected Elevate Coffee and most of the baked goods come from Jonathan Robbins Bakery in Tempe. (Oh my, the pumpkin loaf was perhaps the best I've ever eaten.) The frappes here are also amazing: perfect consistency--not too icy or foamy. (Ask for an extra shot if you want a stronger coffee taste.) Their cold brew is smooth and flavorful. They also have a great little breakfast and lunch menu. (Try the chicken supreme crepe for lunch.) They renovated and changed ownership not too long ago, and the place is the best it's ever been. Nice ambience, the music is not overly loud, and they have a small but very nice patio area. The staff here is always extremely friendly. There's a small \"kids' corral\" over in the corner, where children can play and sit, and there's a really nice little enclosed meeting room that you can reserve, complete with a wall-mounted television. They have free Wi-Fi, of course, and I have spent some time here working remotely on my laptop. If you're in the area and want to try a decent local coffeehouse instead of a chain, then definitely give Saddlecreek Coffee a try!"}
{"text":"It that kinda place where everybody knows your name. Easy. Laid back. Good WiFi. Excellent iced tea."}
{"text":"Great coffee, delicious breakfast panini, precious children's play area, charming ambiance!"}
{"text":"The most friendly staff to greet you in the morning. The food is excellent along with coffee that doesn't break the bank!"}
{"text":"I just moved in the neighborhood and what brought me in was a coupon I received in the mail. This place is decorated farm style which I adore. Love the vibe and the staff is super friendly. The pastries are delicious, the coffee is very yummy. I had the bagel breakfast sandwich that was freshly made and very savory. They make everything fresh which I love.   Another time I went in and ordered the banana Almond crepe. They were out of bananas and the General Manager went out of his way to go to the store, buy some bananas to make the crepe right. Now that's awesome service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great , there was a play area for my kids and the coffee was delish! Everyone left happy:)"}
{"text":"Best coffee that I ever had!! Would love to visit here everyday! My wife and I live in town and never came across this place---we will def be back! Great food and service :)"}
{"text":"There are not many good coffee shops in this general vicinity.  Starbucks doesn't count!  I was very excited to see this new coffee cafe open that is less than a 10 minute drive from where we live.  They told me their coffee is locally owned and roasted in Tempe.  Their cookies and muffins are local as well.  I found the Americano to be very pleasant tasting, not bitter and I would definitely be coming back here again.  As noted with the other reviewers, there is a small lil kiddo section with the cutest retro kitchen for them to play at."}
{"text":"Had a bacon breakfast burrito. Tasted nicely toasted like a panini, but she said they don't fry the bacon themselves and neither the egg. That felt disappointing and also fast food style. Coffee and atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"The cappuccino I ordered was good and the staff was friendly.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the limited seating."}
{"text":"A winner in Cave Creek for outstanding service, great coffee drinks, tasty pastries and good food. Staff is super friendly. They even designed their own specialty drinks for the summer. Friendly environment to chili, surf, and very kid friendly with its own child play area. Check them out"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast on a Sun morning. The place is cute as it can be. Lots of smiley faces at the counter and great menu. Lots of pastries coffees, teas. I got the breakfast crepe, and because you get your choice of 2 meats and veggies I just made it into the chicken Pesto option, & it came out great! One star off because of the couple of dirty dishes around my table, and that attracts a fly... Or 2. Also, if you are going to serve crepes, specially this delicious, they should put a bit of effort on the sauces. A Chicken Pesto chicken crepe should never come with Mexican salsa?! I was scratching my head on that one. I was craving something creamy on top... Mushroom, maybe Hollandaise, or some kind of Pesto creamy topping... balsamic had to do. But that didn't take away the quality of the dish. Overall it was good. Next time I will bring one of my coffee-loving friends. The dirty Chi should be a hit with a nice shot of espresso. So, I'be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in today, service was excellent. Although I don't live close I would suggest if you do to make it your regular place! Only con was my extra large iced coffee was almost $6. Still good though!"}
{"text":"As far as locally owned coffee joints go - this place is as good as it gets. The coffee is fantastic, they even have soy & almond milk (thank you!) My personal choice is a soy vanilla latte, and Saddlecreek makes the best one I've ever had.  You can get your breakfast panini (eggs, cheese, spinach, chorizo/bacon or ham) gluten free, and they have several other gluten free options too! YAHOOO! Nice selection of pastries, and a great environment to chat and hang out. There are booths, tables, and outdoor seating with your pooch's next water bowl. It's a nice relaxing place to chill out with family, friends, or all by your lonesome enjoying your extraordinary joe.  Oh, and the owner has chickens and sells his farm fresh eggs right out of the front refrigerated case. I heart that."}
{"text":"There's not many coffee shops that have an area dedicated to the kiddos, but Saddlecreek Coffee Company does and it makes mommy and daddy happy! We drive 17 minutes just to hang out there with our little guy. And their Almond Milk Dirty Chai? You'd have to travel to Jackson Hole, Wyoming to find something as good as this! The muffins are so moist and delectable (our 22 month old son's eye popping favorite is apple cinnamon!) What's even more enjoyable for our active family is that there's a well-maintained park with tennis courts and a kid's playground just behind the strip mall. Often we make a morning out of our trip to SaddleCreek. I definitely recommend this business."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I ordered a scone and coffee. My scone was hard as a rock, couldn't eat it. They gave me a another one. It was the same as the other, hard I couldn't even break it in two with my hands. I just left it on the table and left with my coffee. So disappointed"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, rustic mixed with modern. They are super welcoming and the baristas are super friendly. The back room is great for larger parties(picture attached). If you like Starbucks frappe's then you might like their versions of Frappuccino's. Frozen hot chocolate is my favorite. Their breakfast menu isn't that large but it's yummy."}
{"text":"Local boy does good! Stopped in for a quick coffee. Place is adorable with great seating and conversation areas. We didn't eat anything but it all looked good and plan to go back and try some food. The owner is very nice and personable and I wish him lots of luck! So great to see a mom and pop!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, great food and amazingly quick. While I thought the menu appeared short I changed my mind about that after popping in for lunch a couple days."}
{"text":"I love so much that place!!! The coffee is tasty , not too sweet or artificial : every time I'm on the road and need a coffee I try to push until Saddlecreek coffee or I'm always disappointed by other coffee shop that I used to go before! Plus sandwiches and crepes are yummy and I always enjoy taking a seat and working on my laptop for couple hours Definitely my favorite coffee place!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last week. My latte was not of good coffee beans quality, did not like it. Then the breakfast burrito? I did not realize this place does not have a kitchen so they cook food in the microwave- totally NOT COOL !!!!! Eggs used to make the burrito came from the box?????? I do not like that at all. I suspect all they serve here comes frozen and already prepared,  all they do is put it together and reheat it in the microwave. Absolutely not worth any amount of money for this type of cooking."}
{"text":"This place is great. The coffee is fairly priced and comes with real neighborhood friendliness. It's a great place for meetings too. They also serve food if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Saddle Creek has a great atmosphere for meeting with friends or business associates, studying, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee. Service was friendly and prompt. I ordered an iced coffee which was flavorful and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I just had a breakfast Crepe I like my veggies grilled so Dan made sure that they are the way I like them and Austin had excellent customer service .. I also got a free pastry  I would definitely be back thank you guys"}
{"text":"I came here with my brother, who is a gigantic fan of this place (see his review below). I was ready to have a similarly great experience, and for the most part, I did. I have some significant food allergies, and the staff was very kind and accommodating, and created a panini that was both delicious and safe for me to eat. I loved everything about the sandwich; the bacon was crispy, the vegetables were fresh and the bread was amazing. I would order it again in a heart beat.  My favorite drink is an almond latte - I turn into a giddy schoolgirl at a boy band concert whenever I see the almond flavor is available. Unfortunately, my coffee was not as amazing as my panini- but, I believe this is due to the Flavored syrups they use, not due to negligence on their part. I've spent considerable time in coffee shops due to my perpetual student status; I've noticed that the DaVinci syrups really ruin a good latte. This was no exception - The  almond flavor made the iced latte taste like Instant breakfast, which was a real bummer since my brother's beverage (always gets unflavored iced coffee) was delicious. I wish they would switch their syrups to the Torani brand, which creates a more tasty latte/flavored coffee, without reminding me of something my mother forced me to drink as a child. I did share my sentiments with the server, who offered to make me something else, but by that point, we were ready to leave, so I didn't take her up on her offer.   All and all, wonderful people and a nice place to sit and enjoy lunch/morning coffee; but maybe opt for the non-flavored coffee drinks unless you notice they've changed their brand. :)"}
{"text":"Consistently solid food, coffee and service! I forgot my wallet the last time I was in, and I asked the manager if there was another way to pay so I didn't have to drag the kids out again. She graciously offered to buy our lunch. I'm still blown away by her generosity, and now that Ive met her, the amazing vibe at this place makes sense. When the person running the show is genuinely caring, it reflects in the food, atmosphere, and staff! Thanks again, Heather!"}
{"text":"I popped in here one day when our son was across the street getting his haircut at the barbershop. I grabbed my wife and I an iced coffee. Good coffee and good service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time. My kids love the kids area and I can enjoy my coffee quietly :) Pastries are good. Definitely we'll come back here. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"What a great little neighborhood coffee and sandwich shop.  Salads are great so are the breakfast items.  It looks they are dog friendly as there are always 1 or 2 on the patio.  Had a BLT the other day and it was fantastic.  If you are in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"Cute tucked away coffee shop! It smells like paninis as soon as you walk in which is a definite plus. It was not very busy for a Saturday morning, only a few people coming and going. The staff was nice and the coffee shop itself is pretty large actually. There was a lot of room in there, and a kids area as well! The bathrooms were nice and clean also. We sat in these big comfy chairs with a little table next to it. I ended up getting green iced tea and I did not like it, but their other options sounded good. My sister got an iced chai latte and it was delicious! It was a pretty spicy chai, which I like. Prices weren't bad either. I was happy to see a couple vegetarian sandwich options on the menu, I am excited to go back and try them! Glad I discovered this place."}
{"text":"Great Coffee shop to have in the neighborhood.  Cowboy Lemonade and their toddy are the best things.  I have enjoyed their breakfast burrito as well.  If your in a hurry call ahead they will help you on your way!"}
{"text":"One of the best independent coffee shops around.  They obviously understand the needs of the niche industry they are in very well and offer a much better food selection than the average shop does.  Very good selection, OUTSTANDING SERVICE, and tasty food brings it all together.  I only wish they could operate late evenings.  I'd like to go here for a late coffee but I understand this area of town rolls up the sidewalks pretty early - no nightlife."}
{"text":"Excellent little coffee place.  The service is great and love supporting the local business.  Excellent seating inside and outside.  Just wish they were opened longer hours on the weekends.  Will be back here again soon."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop with excellent service.  Came here on weekend for light breakfast. Due to miscommunication, they end up making wrong coffee but when I mentioned, staff apologized and made what I thought I ordered originally. I tried to pay the difference but she wouldn't accept. Miscommunication is partly my fault and I apologized a few times and thanked them for the coffee I wanted.  Really loved their decor, lots of inspiring quotes are throughout, I enjoyed reading many of them.   I had breakfast crepes and it was just right portion size and cooked well. I was looking for small breakfast, it was just good.  It's a quite a drive for me here but if I am in the area, I would stop by for breakfast and coffee."}
{"text":"I've been to two events that had box lunches from Saddlecreek and each time was delicious. It's about as good as a business box lunch gets. The sandwiches are made with the most wonderful bread from a local bakery and the chocolate cookies are awesome.  I've had their fruit bread too at a conference and it was wonderful. I've heard they sell out of pastries every day. I wish they were able to bring more of their baked goods."}
{"text":"Saddle Creek Coffee, aka Coffee with a Cause, is a comfortable and relaxing place to get your morning java. They have a nice assortment of seating inside with tables, couches, and even a separate room where I always see people studying. If you have kids, there is a small kids corner for them to play. I'm a chai fan and you can't go wrong with the dirty chai latte. But the real creme de la creme is the food. Get yourself a breakfast burrito and you won't be disappointed. Or feast on one of their delicious crepes!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great coffee and even has a little Play corner for kids! PLUS they just start"}
{"text":"Wish I could give a better score but the crepes were not crepes in the least.  Coffee and muffin were very tasty however!  I wil be back when in the area but more for their pastries then anything else."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is just around the corner from where we live. I love the atmosphere and the play corner for the kiddos. I'll often pop in for lunch because I love the freshly made deli sandwiches that they offer. The coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee place. The food is great as the drinks and service is awesome. Everyone is so nice. It's very welcoming and a comforting place to sit and work. I stop by on my way to the office and I am in and out in a timely manner. When I am working out of office I will work there. They have free WIFI and several areas to plug in my laptop."}
{"text":"I go to this adorable coffee shop at least once a week, sometimes more. My kids and I have had tons of things off the menu: crepes, sandwiches, coffees, teas, smoothies...and everything has always been amazing. Their pumpkin muffin is my teenage daughter's favorite thing! I find the staff so sweet and accommodating every time we walk in the door. I would rather give my money to this local shop than Starbucks or Dutch bros any day."}
{"text":"Top notch! I was here back in October of last year and loved the Veggie Sandwich I had. I recently found my way back to this coffee shop a few days ago, when I was in the area scoping out a few houses. To my surprise, it was completely remodeled. It's super cute and inviting, not to mention the staff is awesome! I picked up 2 breakfast burritos to take home; omg, they were made fresh to order and DELICIOUS! I liked it so much that later in the day when my husband and I had a meeting with our realtor we decided to meet there! I can totally see this place becoming my go to coffee shop."}
{"text":"I have been here only a hand full of times. Each visit is disappointing. The sitting area, including the tables, condiment station, and drink areas are filthy. There are crumbs and dust everywhere. Today's visit, I found myself being circled by two flies while I waited for my breakfast. I have limited options near my house for coffee or breakfast. The only reason I visit is a lack of any other alternative."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito, friendly staff and amazing coffee! Love coming here!! Perfect if you're in a hurry and need something fast and tasty to go or sit outside and enjoy your coffee!"}
{"text":"Checked in here and receive 1 free pastry, yum!  Beautiful rustic interior decor and friendly staffs.   We had savory crepes; turkey pesto and turkey, spinach and mozzarella it was good but unfortunately the crepes were a bit dry.  The chocolate and cheese muffin was excellent! Moist and wasn't to sweet just what I like. The green and raspberry tea was very refreshing for a hot Arizona summer.  Overall experience was excellent! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This hidden coffee shop was right down the street for two years before I even noticed it! But I'm so glad I found it! Just went for some coffee but I will definitely be coming back for some food. Their cowboy lemonade was delicious and there coffee was very reasonably priced. Very unique and eclectic furniture and relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"Love this little Café! Employees are sweet and accommodating. My salad was amazing and the crêpe I tried was super delicious! The environment is very relaxed and kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to try their food yet, but their coffee is tasty and prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly and their menu offers a wide variety of options to choose from."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat they were safe with my peanut allergy and the food was amazing. They partnered with Draper Doughnut and the donuts are completely AMAZING and the Vanilla Frap was great too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, pumpkin muffins, service and atmosphere. I just love this coffee shop! I've been going there for a few years. They've expanded the menu. I love the cozy chairs and the outdoor seating. My favorite Phoenix coffee shop."}
{"text":"To start off, the food and drinks are good.  My two stars reflects the timeliness of service and the fact that my order is almost always wrong.  I live a mile away and want this to be our \"go to\" coffee spot so badly, but my order is wrong about 90% of the time, and it takes FOREVER.  My husband and I have been to this coffee shop 30+ times, I'm frustrated just about every time but it's so convenient so I keep going back.  I am all for hiring young employees, maybe it's their first job, etc., but then they need to be trained better to take orders correctly and to use the ordering system.  It almost seems like their ordering software is too complicated due to the amount of mistakes to my multiple orders, and how backed up the line gets because the staff takes so long to take an order.  Granted, I moved here from Chicago so I'm used to a faster pace, but this just borders on ridiculousness.  Two Examples (although I have many, many more): Today, I order the Mediterranean wrap with no olives.  About 50% of the time, they forget to take out the olives.  But today they actually got it right- yay!  However, my husband got the Mediterranean wrap with chicken, and you guessed it.... no chicken.  We were charged for it though, it just didn't actually make it in the wrap.  My friend was in town visiting about a month ago and she went to pick us up some coffees in the AM.  The worker messed up putting her order in the system.  Just two lattes, but they rang the order up wrong.  My friend was about to pay and noticed the discrepancy so she told the worker which resulted in about $10 due back to her.  The worker said that they could only offer her rewards points for their mistake.  Mind you, they hadn't even made the drinks yet or actually taken her form of payment, but they still wouldn't cancel the wrong order they put in and re-ring it up.  She told them she was from out of town so she didn't want rewards points and she was so tired of waiting in line, so just take the money and make her drinks right.    There are countless more examples I could give but I'm tired of typing this up.  Moral of the story is: be prepared to have the most simplest of orders rang up incorrectly and to stand in line a while.  The drinks are good when they get the order right and the people are nice.  They just don't pay attention to detail and either move too slow or need retrained."}
{"text":"I have been going to this coffee shop on and off throughout the years. I recently went back and was pleasantly surprised how good everything was, the decor very inviting, muffins are the best and the variety they offer. The staff are really friendly too, young and upbeat. I feel so lucky to have a local coffee bar so close. They also serve breakfast foods and lunch.  I will now make this my go to each morning instead of waiting inline at Starbucks Desert Ridge.  You must try it if you are local."}
{"text":"Wonderful place with a great staff coffee is amazing, love the location just hope more people visit. would like for them to add bagels in a little bit more homemade food."}
{"text":"They serve the best coffee I've ever had. Try the Americano.  The employees are all very nice, as is the owner. My wife and I are regulars there now."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop. They have ultra friendly staff and are welcoming to customers. They have a pretty good list of Gluten Free options. Although not on the menu, they make me eggs and bacon plates, instead of the wraps. The coffee is GREAT!  The environment is great. All around, a very good place for coffee and conversation."}
{"text":"Awesome chai tea Lattes and the turkey sandwich is the best one in town... The staff is always friendly and they remember our names!!"}
{"text":"A new and refreshing venue with good coffee and a relaxing laid back environment. Inside offers a warm and inviting atmosphere, and the patio faces east, away from the afternoon sun; which is a big plus in Phoenix. Plenty of space inside to sit and enjoy or do a little work. Owner was extremely friendly and courteous. Definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I want this place to succeed, I want to come  back and give 5 stars. I'm giving 4 stars because it's a locally owned place and I want to support local. It needs some work to get there though. The coffee and tea are great and the atmosphere is as well, my issue is the flow of service. Most people have a certain amount of time to get in and out in the mornings. I've found myself skipping this place because it takes too long, and that's unfortunate. I want to use this place daily and support local businesses. Please, please work on getting people their orders more quickly! We want to support you!"}
{"text":"Found this place because of yelp but didn't live up to the reviews. Took over 30 minutes to get our sandwiches which came in three shifts. Two by two we got our food which was tasty but it was slow and that was ridiculous. At the point we ordered were out numbered employees to customers. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a grilled cheese and a Turkey  sandwich."}
{"text":"Shop local! This was my first time in as I was meeting a friend for a walk nearby. It was cold out. I was looking forward to a warm drink. I ordered a large mocha with almond milk, one pump of chocolate rather than two and 2 shots of expresso rather than the three it came with. To go. It cost $5.67, and tasted horrible. I did not drink it. Additionally the young girl who made the drink literally had her nose in the stainless steel pitcher as she steamed the milk. What she was looking for I'm not sure. But it was disturbing to have her face so close to my steaming milk. If I had stayed there I would have asked for the second pump or a do over but I wasn't going to turn around. There had been three other customers present. All seemed like regulars. Two of whom were making cards at the large community table. They were quite friendly. The third was a reclusive looking dude on a computer. The ambiance was lacking personality. Maybe my coffee tasting so gross was an anomaly. I still won't be back."}
{"text":"Super nice people, wonderfully decorated shop but most of all, fantastic coffee and really good food to boot!"}
{"text":"What a great coffee shop!! They sell toddy which is a nice method of brewing iced coffee. The interior is very spacious and has a kids play corner that my daughter loved.  When your a parent trying to sit down for coffee, it's really great to have a distraction for the kiddos. The breakfast menu is very small, burrito, panini, and some muffins. For parents needing that changing table, they have them here (hooray)!"}
{"text":"The best coffee shop in Cave Creek! If you haven't been here in a while, you must put it on your list! It's under new ownership. The coffee is excellent, the atmosphere is relaxed and clean, the food is delicious, and the staff is so friendly! My go-to order is an iced coffee with whip. They make their own whipped cream and it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service I love the Bacon Egg and Cheese Panini  And the Strawberry Banana Smoothie"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe, friendly staff and a great play area for kids. The drinks are good and although I didn't officially eat one, the pastries look delicious. This is the prefect place to go if you want to hang out with some friends while keeping the kids entertained in the play area."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.  Great food, fair prices and amazing customer service.  I've never been so happy to be out of credit on my Starbucks gold card.  I can now cut ties cleanly and shift my allegiance 100% to Saddlecreek!  Also.  For anyone curious there is a great mix of indoor and outdoor seating with tables, stools and lounge chairs.  They also have a small children's play area. Exceptional."}
{"text":"Although a little pricey, my $8 Turkey Pesto Creepe was Very good.....   And what else can you say about the Dirty Chai Latte, but Excellent....  Well done comfortable space..... Not your average breakfast barrito"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of non corporate coffee shops in the area so I'm a huge fan of Saddlecreek. The people who work here were so friendly. They recommended some good pastries for me. I ended up getting the cinnamon roll which was bomb! The coffee is great quality too.  This place is great to sit and chat with a friend or put your headphones in and work. There is a really cute kids corner so feel free to bring your little one with. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on the way to work.  Coffee was fine, but breakfast burritos proved to be sub par.    Microwaved pre packed egg in a circle shape, microwaved bacon and a slice of cheese wrapped in a tortilla. There were also muffins and pastry available but neither looked home made.  18 bucks for one coffee and two breakfasts was a tad expensive for the final product."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is so inviting, relaxing and friendly!  I love just going there to hang out and I don't even drink coffee (I hear it is delicious from those who do drink it).  I LOVE the ice tea and the food.  I can get a meal to fit my dietary needs!  There are even gluten-free products.  Bring your electronic devices for meetings, come have some food and coffee/tea and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Perfect little coffee shop. Super friendly staff good food and a nice atmosphere. Stop by if your looking for and good cup of coffee"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious mini donuts! Super yummy coffee. New favorite coffee shop! So glad I don't have to go to the 'chain' coffee shop! They have a great kids area too! I'm currently sitting in peace a quiet while they play!"}
{"text":"Holy jumpin jehosaphet! This place has THE BEST. Coffee and breakfast burrito/sandwiches. Forget Starbucks! I will never go to Starbucks again. This coffee is 100000 times better and everyone is happy and friendly.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best family coffee house in the valley. outstanding customer service. all employees are kind and engage in asking regular customers are doing and up to, it's a breath of fresh air in this corporate business world."}
{"text":"I had the turkey sandwich which was amazing it was just the right amount of food, the texture was perfect the turkey was fresh in the greens were fresh. The two young guys working were very polite courteous and efficient. I highly recommend going here"}
{"text":"I appreciate Saddlecreek Coffee's response to my previous review. Thought I give them another try. Ordered an Americano and a pumpkin bread Togo. The coffee was decent and the pumpkin bread was tasty; however, it was really greasy. Notice the greased soaked white bag in my photo. Definitely not healthy slice of pastry. I'd love to try their crepes next time though. They seem to have a wide selection."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. Owners are very friendly and the toddy is addicting !!! They also have yummy sandwiches !"}
{"text":"Another warm smile greeting, hot and very tasty breakfast panni, and very good coffee. Warm and relaxing atmosphere."}
