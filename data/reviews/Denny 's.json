{"text":"Friendly service. Its as clean as any other 24hr diner. Same food as you would see at other breakfasty resturants. A little weird at 2am."}
{"text":"Location moved to 43rd and Peoria in Glendale Towne Center. That location was worse than this one! That was small, crowded, 45 min wait on Sat. Morning and not good! They should've not moved this one!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I'm always treated nicely by the staff. They're friendly and do an excellent job. The food is good too. I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was delightfully tasty. But honestly I've had better. Same goes with their coffee as well. 

I had the red, white and blue slam yesterday and it was okay. It's not as good as they advertise it on tv. It's a good thing they only offer it for a limited time."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  They are lucky I'm even giving them 1 star but the Cali Avocado Skillet dish was pretty tasty.  The waitress messed up our check and took forever for them to fix it."}
{"text":"You always know what you're going to get when it comes to good at Denny's. 

When they're staffed properly, the service is usually prompt and friendly. Looks like I'm in luck, this morning."}
{"text":"Decide to go Denny's for my son's birthday, Yay he got a free breakfast.  The food was fine, very typical Denny's food. I has the biscuits and gravy and a scrambled egg. It was perfect, my son loved his breakfast as well. Will return for my birthday. The waitress was very nice, the food was warm. Just a nice simple place."}
{"text":"This location was awful. The building is brand new,  but the staff is the same garbage staff from across the street location.  The server was hardly around, the food took 45 minutes from time of order.  I would stay away from this craziest."}
{"text":"Well this is my 3rd time here since they moved access the street. The service and food had gone down hill big time. Service is slow, rude unprofessional. The food is poor comes out cold and was wrong. Management does not care and just makes excuses for his staff and food. Plays the blame games but refuse to  compensate you for the bad food and service. When I told him he just said. \" Well this is NOT a 5 stair restaurant we are doing the best your food was remade again and you ate that. Even if I got my remade foid when the rest of my family were almost done eating. Was told the cook didn't see the new ticket right away. Since I have tried them 3 times and all three times there were issues I will never be back. Especially since my last reviewe when staff were yelling and fight with one another and again nothing was done. Very sad to see a place run like this."}
{"text":"Erin? I think his name was.

It started off great, he was super patient with my undecidedness. I hadn't eaten all day and everything sounded good!! He quickly brought a fresh iced coffee when I didn't even realize I slurped the first one down while purusing the menu.

After talking it over with Erin, we decided the breakfast burger was the ticket. Not sure what it was called, it was hasbrown, egg and bacon on a burger pattie.

Once I recieved my meal, Erin disappeared!!! He dropped off my ticket not 2 minutes after he gave me my food and magically fell off the earth. There was about 10 other waiters/waitress there, discussing what sounded like a meeting but was really just an excuse to sit and gossip. 

Not one of these people asked if I needed anything else...which I did. Tobasco sauce would've been fantastic with my meal. The a/c was set to freeze your ass off, and that if you didn't finish your meal in 10mins, it would be cold.

Finally, I got up and paid for my meal when the hostess walked back to her station. Why do they ask if we want to add anything more to the original bill? There's a spot for us to write that in when they hand us the recipt. Sounded fishy. Besides, I try and tip in cash anyway, which I only left a couple bucks. Erin was attentive...in the begining.

Will not be back."}
{"text":"The cooks at this particular Denny's are very good.  The wait staff are friendly and quick.  My mom and I eat breakfast here often and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Always come here for breakfast every Friday, usually don't have silverware on the table but hey its Dennys"}
{"text":"Came for a Grand Slam and it was the best Grand Slam I've ever had. They even made the bacon just the way I requested (very very well done, almost burnt without actually burning), which is rare because at most places I still get floppy bacon no matter what I say. The hostess was friendly, my waitress was friendly and efficient, and the dining area was clean and organized. Definitely want to come back to this location."}
