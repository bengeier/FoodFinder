{"text":"Hands down, the best pho I've ever had, and that's saying something because I've eaten a lot of pho here in Phoenix and elsewhere. Simply the best broth and fresh, pungent ingredients directly from the Vietnamese market next door.  This is authentic and I can't get over how inexpensive the large bowl is. I come here at least twice a month. If you love pho, do yourself a favor and check this place out.  I love the vegetable pho personally."}
{"text":"Located in a sketchy neighborhood this quaint hole in the wall certainly doesn't disappoint and you can't beat the price!!"}
{"text":"this is a place you have to seat yourself. There was no talking involved other than the waiter asking us what we want to order. The guy who drop off the food just put it down and left, we had to figure out which one was which. No water refills, flies visited our table often (not sure if  this is normal for the phoenix area because the door was open). We ordered pho, my friend liked it but I didn't because the soup tasted sweeter than I usual have it. The place seems pretty popular there were people coming in and out. When paying, you have to walk up to the counter yourself and pay. There was no service to speak of."}
{"text":"Now this is vietnamese!  Have eaten here for 4 years and still love it.  The Pho is authentic, the cold spring rolls fresh in every way and the grilled chicken just yummy.  We love to cook our own shrimp and beef on the hot plate, then pack and roll our own rolls.  The fresh coconuts are cut to order with this huge machete and are like dessert.    Fast and furious service and all for under $10 a head."}
{"text":"This is a very mom and pop shop! If you're judgement is  this based on the bathroom ambiance and service of a restaurant you're missing out. This place is an absolute favorite for my husband and I. Their shrimp fried rice is the best I've ever had! Their pho tai is amazing as well. Something that I would critique is that it seems like they add the beef before it's served vs. while it's being poured. Its not a flavor factor, more like a texture thing. I haven't tried their fried egg rolls only because their spring rolls have me hooked! Typically we order 2 soups, spring rolls and fried rice and pay a teeny bit over $20 (what a STEAL). The service is super fast but I think that there is a serious language barrier between servers and guests therefore it doesn't come off as friendly. Either way, this place is awesome and everyone that we have taken there had been impressed!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is open right now. It looks like they are doing construction. However, when it is open I highly recommend. Good service. Good Phone soup!"}
{"text":"Pho is ok..the meat is very tough. I didn't care for the place, kind of dirty my opinion. I would give the place a 4 stars if the staff was friendly and the place was clean. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh shares the top spot on my favorite Viet-food-in-the-valley list.  Cheap, delicious, great/quick service.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"I love this place,  always a good crowd of people, and good price.  I always get a fresh Thai coconut, the spring rolls, and some pho.  I often bring friends and they love it.   I'd go more often if it were closer."}
{"text":"Completely awesome!   Food was amazing...sugarcane juice and coconut made it perfect!  And...you can beat the price. Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Does it really take 30 minutes to make some spring rolls and a Vietnamese sandwich? The place wasn't super busy and they have a lof of staff. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Pho!! I love pho!! I love that they had the garlic chili. Oahu has some really good pho but Arizona has some really really good pho!! Gotta comeback    There XL is really large!!"}
{"text":"This place has all the usual Vietnamese dishes and drinks. I have been here several times and this is as good as it gets. For those that have not tried Vietnamese food I highly recommend starting here. Pho Thanh (translates to soup bar) is the typical Pho restaurant, nothing fancy, but has every thing you need for a great meal.   Come in make eye contact with the person behind the counter, point to the table you want to sit at. If they nod ok, go sit there. If they point to another table, go sit there. This is just the way it is at all Vietnamese restaurants.   Having been a big fan of Pho over the last 20 years or so, I had a need for a Pho fix. I of course went strait to Yelp to find the closest place. Since this was the only place close to the house. The reviews looked good, I figured I would give it a try.  It was just what I was looking for, It is as good as any I have had. Better than a lot of other places. Very consistent with the broth. I have been back repeatedly.   Over the years I have gained a wife and two kids? What  how did that happen? Wow, any way I wanted to introduce them to this. So we took my two year old with us the first time. I kinda knew my wife would like Pho if she just tried it. My two year old I started off on the pork chops on rice. Now that was some good pork chops! When we pull in to the parking lot my daughter now says \"Pork Chops\" and jumps up and down. We now go there as a family and and my two year old also loves the soup dishes. Since the bowls are big bowls we have to share with the kids, there is now way they can finish a bowl that big! The spring rolls are great. If you like coffee you have to try Cafe sua da, a very dark coffee over ice.    So far over the last few years this place has been a great place to go for some good food. Service has been prompt and courteous. and the food has always been great."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in phoenix in my opinion. Great food and friendly staff. Customer service can be lacking at times, but the food makes up for it. Egg rolls are a must here. I've tried some other pho places around but this has got to be the best I'd say."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch here. I got #26, egg noodle soup with pork wontons, shrimp, squid, etc. He got the pho beef soup (not sure of the number) and we shared the shrimp spring rolls. Seriously delicious and great value.   I ordered out another night and got #31 and was pretty happy I got this one to eat at home it was delicious but I made a mess of myself. Clean up on aisle Cookie!  Can't wait until winter... I can see myself eating here once a week!"}
{"text":"Their Pho seems to be a miracle cure for colds. Their spring rolls are also quite tasty. I've only done take out here, so can't comment on service. Prices are great, lots for your dollar."}
{"text":"Pho was decent. I had to put alot of extras into it.  The place was clean, and inviting, and the portions were huge"}
{"text":"Best pho in town!!! Absolutely love coming to this place! Nothing compares!! Definitely recommend coming! I always get the pho ga (chicken pho) and the broth is AMAZING!"}

{"text":"In a year of living here, I've been to quite a few Vietnamese restaurants, and this is probably my favorite.  This place is a classic East Asian restaurant in the Chinese style, which means mediocre service, mediocre environment, dumpy location, but a huge menu and very good food.  First of all, don't come here if you insist on hipster ambiance.   Don't come here if you're a germophobe or have OCD. Come here, enjoy the chaos, order a drink, some goi coun rolls, and some type of main course.  Aside from the ubiquitous pho, there are plenty of other noodle options, both wet and dry.  I love the seafood noodle soup, the pho and the wonton soup.  Ok, I love it all!    The vermicelli noodles topped with meats, egg rolls, peanuts, fresh veggies and Vietnamese sweet and sour sauce is awesome, in all its manifestations.  The seafood on fried noodles is delicious too.  If you're into fish, the hot pot catfish is excellent and comes with rice and a side of fresh veggies.  There're also plentiful other seafood offerings including shrimp and squid.  Pork, beef and chicken also feature prominently on the menu, as do more unusual dishes like tamarind soup.  If you've never had Vietnamese food before, it is not altered here to satisfy American palates.  It's cooked for the many Vietnamese who frequent this establishment.  The menu will never bore you,  it's tasty, fresh, extensive, and very affordable."}
{"text":"Delicious!  This place really filled up fast after 7pm.  Service was brisk and efficient, pho was great!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my Favorite places to eat in Phoenix due to the great food and inexpensive prices. I have only tried Bun-Vermicelli #39 (BUN BO XAO --- w/stir fried beef, sprouts, lemongrass, peanuts and fish sauce) , #42 (BUN CHA GIO THIT NUONG --- w/eggrolls, grilled pork, vegetables, peanuts and fish sauce) and The Com Tam-Broken Rice #68 (COM TAM TAU HU KY DAC BIET --- Broken rice w/ shrimp cake wrapped in bean curd skin, bbq pork, shredded pork, egg, crab-egg cake).... all were very good with the #42 being my Favorite so far. The place is a bit risk-K looking from the outside but the inside is nice and clean, well lite with lots of Asian charm with a hint of a mom and pop dinner feel. I have also tasted the soup but not sure which one it was but it was D-lish for sure and they serve it in a huge bowl. Most every time I go there are several Vietnamese families dining there and they seem to favor the Soup. I would recommend to put this on a must try list and check out this great hidden treasure. I moved to this area in March of 2009 and am still learning where the good places to eat are for someone on a budget. This place will cost about the same as fast food but a much better place for food and nutrition. Give it a try and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Best Pho, best spring rolls and best sandwiches!! I would have given 5 stars but the service is sometimes not so great. Most of the servers don't smile and have no personalities. But other than that, the food does come out super quick once ordered and it is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but the place is dirty.  It's sad that having so good food you are failing in cleaning and the customer service."}
{"text":"I dont know why i even bother giving this establishment another shot, but unfortunately i did. They've expanded a lot throughout the years and has many 5 star reviews on yelp.....but, their food is still the same. Mediocre at best! Pho broth has this off putting flavor, that im not used too. the cuts of meat were too fatty and some were thick and chewy!  The rice dish my husband ordered was just okay, nothing great.  Maybe im just used to my regular go to pho joint, pho 43 on thomas. Oh, and as for service....there is none. Menus were given without a single word said. Throughout our meal, no one bothered to fill our drinks or hell, they never even looked in our direction! I mean i would cut them some slack if they were, lets say....on their lunch break....but nope, just standing around, doing nothing."}
{"text":"I did give this place a 5 stars ...  But very disappointed with my latest visit ... Honestly, I am very glad to see this store expands and getting lot more business since their expansion with cleaner interior and all ... but what happened to the quality ?!?!  It seems they are putting less meat into the bowl these days ... and worst of all, I found a hair in my pho today !!!    I understand with more people coming in, you try to cut cost ... but at least keep it clean ... !!!   I am done with this place"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was HORRIBLE. I went with a friend who is vegetarian and all we asked was if the broth in the vegetarian soup had a meat base and the waiter kept cutting us off, eventually listened, heard and answered and smacked the menus on the table and walked away. We still had a question about the spring rolls and another waitress came with the same attitude and called us complicated. All we litterally wanted to confirm was that the spring roll and soup was vegetarian. Horrible customer service, and the food was not at all worth stepping back in there. The expirience is part of what we pay for, and I cannot say that this was even worth it despite the cheap prices."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Found another Thai place we like better pretty close by though."}
{"text":"I LOVE their pho. it's kind of ridiculous how often I go honestly. (once sometimes twice a week). I think their pho tastes the best out of all the pho places in az. this is saying a lot cause I used to hate it, but I'm craving it right now. highly recommend"}
{"text":"I don't know all the details exactly but I was just in there the other day and it appeared that they were having a routine health inspection and I didn't mention it at the time but there were a few roaches walking around. . Looks now like the health inspector shut them down for 2 weeks or something like that. . Gross."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food had never even crossed my mind before, so after someone mentioned Pho Thanh I was interested in trying it. I've been there six times as of now.   The first time I went to the Pho I didn't have time to eat my meal there so I got take out. I got the number 133, which is a charbroiled slab of beef with steamed rice and veggies (posted a pic of this). Although for me it was more like charbroiled fat and bone; it hardly had any beef at all. My friend ordered the same thing, but he actually got a slab of beef. Maybe I was just unlucky and got the bad part of the \"beef\".   On my second trip I got the number 42, which is vermicelli (cold noodles) that come with a pork shrimp sliced egg roll, sliced grilled pork patty, and veggies all in the same big bowl. The pork patty was very good; juicy and tender, the egg roll was good too, and the vermicelli was kind of bland by itself until I mixed it with the veggies which where hidden underneath it, and added a little salt.   On my third time there I got the number 12 beef noodle soup / pho tai. To me, the broth was just OK but nothing special. Thinking that the broth was just a fluke that day, I got the shrimp pho at a later visit and again I wasn't too crazy for the broth. But I've been to the nearby Da Vang and I loved the pho there. I've ordered it twice and both times it has been great...a little on the salty side, but still better than Pho Thanh's for my personal taste.   I've also ordered the number 123, which is beef and a salad, with either rice or bread. I chose mine with rice; it goes great with the beef. The salad was OK. The beef was very juicy and tender. I put some beef in the rice a little at a time. They bring out the beef cut in small cube bite size pieces on a metal plate still sizzling loud enough to get the attention of the other diners.   Also, I've ordered pork shrimp egg rolls as an appetizer, and a banh mi sandwich for take out my four times there. The egg rolls are great; they also come with a plate of veggies and fish sauce to dip the rolls in. I've tried all four sandwiches and my favorite is the number 75 grilled pork sandwich; the patty in this sandwich and the patty that comes with the number 42 are just so juicy and tender! (posted pics of the egg rolls and a sandwich, tho it's the cold cut sandwich)   Inspired by Da Vang's delicious beef stew / bo kho, I decided to try the beef stew with rice noodles here at Pho Thanh. It was a disappointment. The portion is only half of what Da Vang gives you, and the pieces of beef are not tender and are studded with chunks of fat, and there weren't many noddles to speak of, the opposite of Da Vang's. I ended up leaving all the pieces of beef because they had so much fat on them it was impossible to eat around it. It wasn't very filling In the end it wasn't a very good meal. If you want a generous amount of good beef stew I recommend trying it at Da Vang.   Da Vang may have the better beef stew, but Pho Thanh has the better bahn xeo crepe. At Da Vang it's really greasy, rock hard, burnt, and very little filling. Here at Pho Thanh it's perfect; not much grease, pliable, and a generous amount of bean sprout, shrimp, and pork filling.   Having been to both Pho Thanh and Da Vang, I personally prefer Da Vang. Like most Vietnamese places, the prices are great; about less than $10 for a meal, and you will get more than enough food. (Unless you order the beef stew at Pho Thanh lol)"}
{"text":"Tasty pho, delicious crab soup (you should ask them to remove the solidified pig blood if you are not a fan), fresh bean sprouts and mint leaves, fast turnaround service, and cheap! 6.45 for regular size bowl.  Dessert is awesome for 2.49.  From the looks of it customer base, it is not only vietnamese customers and very diversified. Looks like all the locals come here and there is a vietnamese market in the same plaza for convenience.  The extra 1.50 to supersize your bowl is no joke. We just finished a half marathon and had trouble finishing it!"}
{"text":"It's not the BEST pho I've ever had, however for only 6-7 bucks it's totally worth it. Always fresh veggies and legit pho. I highly recommend this place for those who are on a budget and want a good meal. FYI this place is super busy on the weekend around 11-2 ish with limited parking."}
{"text":"The iced Vietnamese coffee is really yummy and has quite the caffeine kick!"}
{"text":"Authentic, cheap and delicious. I would come back in a heart beat. Bun Bo was delicious though I would like a little more meat and more huyet (pork blood, yes, pork blood!!). All for 6 dollars. You wouldn't find this price unless you're in Cali or Texas."}
{"text":"Fast service + great prices.  While it's not the most amazing bowl of pho I've ever had, it's one of the best in Phoenix. You won't come here for the service, you won't come here for the private dining; what you will come here for is the Pho and if it's any help, it seems the Vietnamese population of Phoenix agrees (by their attendance).  You can find a better broth at a more expensive place but I come here for a quick and simple lunch that never weighs me down and costs close to nothing for the amount of food you get.  Thai tea seems to be the same everywhere so try the egg soda, the coconut drink (still in the coconut) or one of the best lime aids I've ever had.  Tip: Pho plates are on the first page. Skip this and flip to the back of the menu. Here you will find the choice cuts of meat for Pho. If beef, ask for it on the side and you will get some beautiful deep red cuts (try #116). Also, anything other than Pho can take a while to make so stick with the Pho unless you have time."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh is hands down the best pho place for both price and taste.  The #12 and #3 are my usual faves, but the shaken beef is unreal.  The staff isn't the friendliest in the world, but it is usually packed and they are still very quick.  It is also conveniently located next to a small grocer where we occasionally stop in to get produce or noodles not offered in the big chains.  I have to stop myself from coming here multiple times a week!"}
{"text":"Not only the best Pho in Phoenix, but also the best iced coffee in Phoenix. The rice dishes are also amazing... pork chop FTW."}
{"text":"Coming from the Pacific NW with an abundance of Vietnamese food, I was disappointed that a city the size of Phx doesn't have a very good vietnamese line-up.  Pho Thanh (which I think was formerly Pho Bang and now has new owners) was a pleasant surprise.  My review isn't as verbose as some of the other experts here.  However, I will go as far as to say that  we have found our little piece of Saigon in the desert.  The Vietnamese Spring Rolls are fantastic and only $2.25 for two large fresh shrimp and pork!  Usually pho variations shouldn't be much different from restaurant to restaurant (cause if you mess up pho, you won't stay in business).  Pho Thanh's Pho definitely stands out above any others I've tried.    After our first visit, we only lasted 72 hours before having to return.  The wait staff is very very friendly and helpful to people new to Vietnamese food.    Oh yah, an entry is around $5 and you will definitely have left-overs.  And, unlike some other Asian cuisine, Vietnamese is very very good for you.  There isn't an item on the menu that is even fried.  All fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant but the food is excellent.  Love the Pho, the eggrolls, and the sammiches.  I always get takeout because they can get very busy and the service is just okay.  Also park in the back because the front parking lot is always full."}
{"text":"My first time having pho from this restaurant was excellent. It's very tasty. I've been there a few times since moving in October. The staff is nice fast service. Hardly have to wait to be seated. The beef pho always taste the same. I love the spring rolls. I always leave here full."}
{"text":"I have moved away from phoenix, but i thought i should still give my opinion since i ate here so often.    consistent good pho.  i've stuck to pretty much that, the rolls and the broken rice combo, and all have been good.  the only thing that i might change is maybe more meat in the bowls...other than that good place for pho."}
{"text":"Great Pho. We come here every weekend and really enjoy the food. Great fast service. I'm always satisfied with their quality of Pho. Highly recommend it. Very affordable."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh is the best Vietnamese eatery in the central Phoenix area, hands down.   The spring rolls are outstanding, and never fall apart on me. If you haven't done so before, broaden your appetizer horizons and get #5, the banh xeo Saigon crepe. Use the large lettuce leaves as wrappers, and assemble little pockets of fresh herbs and crepe filling.  Need comfort food? Their Pho noodle soup is incredible, served with the expected pantheon of fresh herbs and other condiments. Not feeling like soup? Try the lemongrass chicken or beef. Most other Vietnamese restaurants deep fry the meats for this dish, but Pho Thanh serves theirs nicely sautéed in a rich sauce. The vermicelli noodle bowls, Bun, are extraordinary in their vivid flavors, and are perfect light food for those craving a change from heavier Southwest standards.  I've noticed a few reviewers were put off by the service, but I think you have to understand the vibe of the place to appreciate it. Are the servers going to refill your drink without being asked? Probably not. Will they get you absolutely anything you can think of requesting? Definitely. You'll get your food quickly and politely. Speak up if you need anything.  Do yourself a favor. Try Pho for breakfast sometime. There's a reason Pho Thanh opens at 8:30 AM."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great price.  It is hard to beat if you are looking for that perfect hole in the wall Viet restaurant.  Service is spotty when they are busy so go in with that understanding and you will not be disappointed or aggravated.  The excellent food and low price more than make up for the inconsistent service.  The Pho is awesome.  The fresh roles are really good and inexpensive.  A feast for 2 for under $20 is no problem!  The restaurant can get very busy so off-times like mid-afternoon assure immediate seating and better service.  We did take-out for a dinner party once and plated it ourselves at home and it really wowed everybody...the looks were beatiful and it tasted even better.  There are lots of Viet traditional dishes on the menu to explore.  Going here can be an adventure if you want to explore beyond the Pho."}
{"text":"So the location is a tad ghetto...yes, but don't let that stop you! This place has some REALLY good pho, and if that's what you are looking for then you'll leave happy. Broth is flavorful and aromatic, just as it should be. Noodles are never over cooked, beef  is tender. You will definitely get enough fixings to spice it up- generous portions for sure!  Downside, and hence the three stars: First, as great as their Pho is,  everything else....sadly, not so great. Lackluster to say the least. And secondly, the broth in the Pho is consistently a bit too greasy for my liking...as a certified pho addict, I've had my fair share. So believe me when I say- they need to get that grease under control! I usually mop it up with a paper towel before diving in, and that seems to do the trick."}
{"text":"Best pho takeout place I've been to in Arizona. Quick service. Broth is excellent, meat, not so much.   Price is pretty much average.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best PHO I have ever had thank you Yelp! I would recommend this spot to anyway reading this now!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Best pho broth around. I have been going here for a long time and think their spring rolls are the best around as well.  Price is always good. It's busy at lunch and parking is limited so expect that but the food  always delivers.  I have told many people about this place and will continue to do so. Best Vietnamese food in the valley"}
{"text":"i love it here! like the waiters shirt say: EAT MORE PHO!!! best pho in arizona better than da vang & pho 43 combained hands down!"}
{"text":"A great deal for awesome Pho.  I've tried Pho at 2 or 3 places in Phoenix, and can't say that I know what Pho is \"supposed to taste like\", but I crave this.  The amount of cilantro, basil and razorgrass (?) that comes with the Pho really adds to the flavor.    For anyone complaining about service, I think that it is more an issue of expectation - they bring my food within 10 minutes of ordering.  They fill my water glass if they notice it.  It's better to think of this place as being more like \"cafeteria-style\" rather than a sit down restaurant - they're curt, but quick, which they have to be considering how busy they always are.  Also, it's so affordable, I can eat here without feeling like I'm dining out since I don't think I could make such good food for less at home."}
{"text":"This is a serious pho place since the expansion.  The portions are huge, the quality is better than average and the prices are great.  I haven't had a dish I didn't like.  The sandwiches, rice vermicelli, spring rolls, and pho are all great."}
{"text":"Very open restaurant, not cramped like other Pho stores. Bonus is that it is connected to a boba/drinks shop next door so you can walk right over to get boba.  The broth was not the best I've ever had, it lacked flavor, but everything else in it was good. Overall, pretty good place to eat for pho and other Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I now have a tradition of getting their pho and shrimp spring rolls once a week, and it's just as delicious every time. While Pho Tang may not seem like much from the outside, a quick look inside is a testament to the quality of their soup. I can't recall a time that the restaurant wasn't bustling with happy customers, anr from inside you can see the areas of the store which used to be adjacent businesses, but the restaurant was able to expand to serve mire people. The soup itself is hard to beat. A large bowl of pho is less than $7, and comes with a tray of vegetables to add to your liking. Two spring Erika is around $2, so for $10 I always leave completely full and satisfied. The broth and meat included in the soup are both great on their own, and the variety of fresh vegetables complement it even more so. Best of all, however, is the ability to request an order of pho to go for the same price. One of the best restaurants to visit on a budget, and one I reccomend to everyone in the area to try."}
{"text":"I stop here at least 3 times a week.  Inexpensive, so great for the budget conscious person, but taste like a 4 star meal.  The Pho Broth is perfect every time.  This place is always packed with a mix of people,  I just wish the servers were a little bit more friendlier."}
{"text":"Got to say the best pho noodle soup I had in a long time, order the number 11 beef noodle soup but the service could be a little better, needed water to refill and had to wait and ask couple of time, bathroom is okay could be cleaner But overall not disappointed. Will be back again to try their other soups options."}
{"text":"Good place for traditional Pho and other Vietnamese dishes.  Prices are really great.  Service is fast.  One of the places I will go in Phoenix for Pho."}
{"text":"I am boring and get the pho ga but it is amazing! It has great flavor, huge (enough for two meals), and super cheap! Plus they have takeout ready in no time!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience having Vietnamese food in Phoenix.  Maybe my expectations were a little to high. The place is small, run down and dirty. The floors looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. The service was okay, but the disappointment came with the food. I don't think I can go back. I thought it was way to greasy... I won't be going back Needless, who cares about the price."}
{"text":"Found a cock a roach in my bowl of pho and just walked out that was the worse experience ever of my day of eating pho"}
{"text":"4 million stars!  Well priced, extremely fast, and amazingly delicious food. This has been the saving grace of sick days and busy weeknights were my lovely wifey turns into a food rage monster can only be satiated by a tasty firestorm of pho. Here's looking at your sav r ;) if you don't like pho, it is because you have a problem with yourself   Remember, if you over do it with the sriacha.....it is my divine intervention. The furry of the chile gods is testing you to become a stronger person. Persevere. Stay strong."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!! First off I always appreciate a great dive joint but to top that, the food is incredible and very reasonable in price. Now I'm no expert in Vietnamese food but considering the place is always packed with Vietnamese people I have to believe that's a good sign.   If you're feeling adventurous I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Went back for more! I can't say that I've changed my order much (still the Tofu Pho). Also got an order of spring rolls on the side, and yes, I did eat everything. So delicious! The owner yelp-mailed me and said that they do offer crispy tofu in their Pho. I tried it this evening and was thankful that I did. Loved it. Pho Thanh has become my go-to place for a quick, delicious and wallet-friendly meal!"}
{"text":"Love at first bowl! You know you found something wonderful when you're in the car ten minutes after your last bite/slurp and you're still savoring the flavor of what you just ate and thinking about who  you can return there with.  That's what happend to me at Pho Thanh.  I awoke this morning tired, achy, and just plain meh. After sitting in the office on auto-pilot and sending off an e-mail or two, it occurred to me that I needed soup. American chicken noodle? Nah. Menudo or Posole? As much as I love them, not today. I needed something like Pho, Udon or Soba. There's an elixir-like quality to East Asian soups (those that I have had, at least) that you can't get from minestrone, French onion, or Campbell's tomato.  When I walked into Pho Thanh I knew it was the place for me. Nearly every table was full at noon, and just about everyone there had a big bowl of Pho in front of them.  I had the everything Pho (meatballs, beef, tripe, tendon), and it was absolutely fantastic. A big serving of herbs and bean sprouts, chile peppers and limes for squeezing made me a happy man. The broth was not salty, and all of the meats were tender and possessed their own flavors. i hate it when soups taste the same no matter what you're biting into, but this was not the case. Flavors were able to stand on their own, in synergy with the broth and the other flavors, and the serving of noodles was plentiful.  I will return, hopefully with friends, coworkers, and family.  NOTE: Expect to walk in, spot an empty table, sit down, order and be served WITHOUT being spoken to. Smiley customer service is not Pho Thanh's specialty, awesome Pho is."}
{"text":"This place is solid, especially since my Vietnamese buddy recommended it. Better than similar places around. The Com Tam Thanh Dac Biet is money and hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Fast fresh clean and tasty. .. best coconut water in Western Phoenix I have tried so far. And the site fry is great and so is the soup."}
{"text":"Should really be a 3.5. See below:  Good: Some of the best food is found in the most random, unexpected (and sometimes sketchiest) looking places. This is one of them. Started coming here based on the recommendation of my husband's former boss, who is Vietnamese. We liked it, and we've returned a few more times. LOVE the sugar cane shrimp, egg/spring rolls, and most of the pho.  Bad: Made the mistake once of ordering one of their sandwiches (banh mi) for lunch the next day; nope, nope, nope. Don't do it. Bread was stale, meat and fillings didn't seem fresh either. Not a fan of: the service. Yes, the place in busy, yes, you have a constant rotation of people waiting to be seated, but please don't rush me out, and certainly don't almost throw my plate on the table. I know it's not a buffet, but please let me enjoy meal and company."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple dish with egg noodles, mixed veggies, and tofu. It smelled overwhelmingly of feet. No kidding. Stinky-ass feet. Couldn't eat it. No thanks."}
{"text":"BEST Vietnamese restaurant in the central valley. Clean, great menu selection, FABULOUS prices and always packed by locals! My go-to place for Pho & spring rolls."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside, but the pho is good and cheap (the broth isn't quite as good as Noodles Ranch in Scottsdale, but it's a whole lot cheaper).  The bun thit nuong has pork patties on it - didn't taste bad, but I'm used to grilled, thinly sliced pork pieces, so I wouldn't order that again.  This place is crazy busy at lunch, but food comes out fast."}
{"text":"Best Bahn Xeo and Pho w/tenderloin we have had in Phx or LA for that matter.  Not the best area or ambiance, but food is so good and inexpensive it makes it part of the fun.  Cannot recommend this place enough.  yum, been there at least 10X!"}
{"text":"Their Pho is good. It's tasty and the grilled chicken is delicious. The customer service needs improvement, they need to add more staff on busy days."}
{"text":"Pho is good and has a good amount of meat. It's the best kind of comfort food ever."}
{"text":"BBQ beef wrapped in grape leaves. Just get it already. It's listed as an appetizer, but plenty for two meals with the vermicelli or rice. Charred and delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not the swankiest part of town, nor the swankiest building, but it is CLEAN! You can tell they care and do what they can to keep the inside decent. Anyway, KILLER Pho! I love the broth and all the greens they give you. I'm a tripe fan so I get #17 beef and tripe pho. My kids love it too. And keep it on the down low, this place is as cheap as it gets. An XL will feed two (or a pig like me...) Give it whirl. I know there are people passionate about their pho and will argue to the death, but this place is great. It's also getting busier every time I go there which is a great sign!"}
{"text":"Hey Yall....The absolute worst PHO that I've have in my life thus far....I've had PHO from east to west coast and this place was down right digesting. All I ordered was the chicken PHO, which turned out to be a PHO-ING disaster.  No Flavor and ALL OIL....I tired to drain it, soak it up with napkins and bread. After all that work I was done. Maybe the dining in experience is better..I mean it has to be..word to the wise don't let CROWDED PLACES fool you.  :("}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price and good service!   I wish Pho Thanch has opened one branch in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pho won't be the same for me anymore. I like my pho like I like my women, cheap, hot, and authentic. Best value for the price."}
{"text":"Our first time here. I had the Pho rare beef and my husband had the Pho rare beef and meatballs. Very tasty and not expensive. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Had pho. Spring roll. Egg roll. Crepe dish here. Already came here for several times all food tasting is good. Flavor. Texture. Doneness is very good but the service was slow. I had to find servers to refill water and all the tables were filled with leftover dishes. Other than that everything is good"}
{"text":"Delish only place here I can get a great bowl of tofu veg that isn't lacking flavor or ingredients. Place is always packed and for good reason so I Dont mind sitting family style with randoms or waiting a bit...its that good =) always on my top of recommendations to ppl that need to try pho"}
{"text":"Super disappointed.  I've eaten at plenty of pho places, mainly in Las Vegas and one in Flagstaff, and they have all been better than this.  \"Why?\" you might ask, and the answer lies within the broth.  To me, what makes a pho place good is the broth.  I always get the beef ball pho, but this time I mixed it up a little and got the sliced beef and meatball pho (I know, I'm a risk taker).  It makes it easy to compare to other places, so I'm not kidding when I say the soup is definitely lacking in taste.  They definitely do not skimp on the meat though (as opposed to many, many pho places) so if that floats your boat, this is your place.  I have to admit, my impression of this place started better off.  My boyfriend and I split the cold cut combo sandwich and I thought it was very good.  Granted, I have not had that many Vietnamese sandwiches, but I could eat this everyday.  I guess until I eat a really great one.  But that was a good experience for me, so now I want to order one of those every time I visit a pho restaurant from now on!  Verdict?  I would not give this place another chance, because the broth is very important to me.  You would like this place if you liked other Vietnamese dishes, or pho with other kinds of broths."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. It was super busy I didn't get utensils until 20 min after got my food, I had to share. The waiter could've explained the menu better but they rushed me. I would've like to have known what the specialty was or something I should try."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck. To eat: -Bo luc lac (sizzling beef with vegetable salad) -Pho Tai (broth doesn't need much added to it) -iced coffee (especially if you like strong coffee) -Banh mi sandwiches (because how can you beat $2.75 for a sandwich, really)  Service is super fast, too."}
{"text":"We stopped by here to have some food on Wednesday because Da Vang is closed.  After placed the order, my husband took our sons to the bathroom and they came out and said it was too dirty and smelly. I went to the women one was fine but the paper was on the floor and seemed like no one care clean up.  While we were waiting for our food, the server/bus boy was cleaning the table on the other side of my husband and he just threw the plates to the basket and made a very loud noise. My sons were scared and so was I. Found out that the people that just left, did not leave any tips.  The food was not that good. The soup was little salty and my husband rice dish with grilled pork was too dry. It is so obvious that we will never return to this restaurant and will not recommend it to anyone in the family or friends."}
{"text":"Really good pho and ground shrimp diy spring rolls! They have such an amazing variety of things to try - I eat at a lot of pho places and I like to have lots of options to keep things fresh and this place does that. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the cleanliness factor. The staff was sneezing into their hands and wiping it on their apron and not washing or sanitizing their hands. Also they keep the chopsticks in a container on the table with the end you are going to put in your mouth face upward so that you have to touch many chopsticks to get yours out. There were other questionable things going on which is why I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great Pho, even better prices!   Very authentic hole in the wall type place. Always with a line out the door.   If you are in the area and in the mood for Pho, this place is won't let you down."}
{"text":"Best pho in town. I rarely, if ever, venture off the pho menu but my wife is vegetarian and always finds amazing options."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is so cheap it's crazy! Is their food any good then?! Hell to the yeah! I had one of those soups and it blew my mind! their coconut juice made me so happy! they actually crack a coconut  for you! My friends had #51 and it was so good!"}
{"text":"Worst F***ing service. Been to alot of hole in wall restaurants. You are better off eating top ramen @ home...Nothing special about the food. Bottom line this place sucks d***"}
{"text":"My regular spot for Vietnamese food! They have an extensive and affordable menu.   For appetizer I recommend the Bo nuong la nho (beef wrapped in crispy grape leaves with a side of rice noodles, vegetables, and rice wrap). I also recommend the fried rice, egg rolls, and Banh ceo.  For entree, I recommend pho (of course), won ton noodle soups (great broth every time so far), com tam, bun rieu, and the rice noodles with egg rolls. Those dishes haven't failed me yet.  I recommend coming back here and trying out different items on their menu. They're one of my top picks for pho places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said in the previous 149 reviews? Probably very little.  - extremely busy  - incredible amount of caucasian customers for a Vietnamese restaurant  - if you expect clean, don't go here (pretty much true for every Vietnamese restaurant in the valley with the exception of Saigon Nights in Scottsdale)  - parking can be challenging  - the crepe appetizer is very tasty  - pho, banh mi are up to par  - the broken rice combo plates are quite good.  - solid restaurant but not special  I can't help but wonder how it is possible for them to make that much pho each day."}
{"text":"The Pho here is excellent and the price is even better! It's not in the way of ambience but it's not too shabby either. Went here with 3 friends and everyone was very happy with their food. You know everyone is satisfied when not a word is spoken until everyones done eating.."}
{"text":"The soup is rather blend, the meat is ok.  Price is about right as other pho places at other states.  Coffee is decent.  Maybe it is the best in town, certainly not up to par with the ones in Philly, And DC.."}
{"text":"I am a Pho lover. This is the best in west island. Even if you live around Laval area, that's where you should go for Pho or Bon Bo Hue."}
{"text":"Great broth, very authentic, but the service is nothing to write home about. Typical of a lot of pho places. You sit down they slide the menu on the table, wait for you to pick which pho bowl. Takes your order, your pho arrives a few minutes later and that it. If you ask for extra greens or anything else you don't get it until you're almost done with you pho then it arrives if at all. You come here for the food, because it's fantastic, not the service."}
{"text":"I went here with friends who were regulars there, and I'm so happy that they introduced me to this restaurant! The service was great, the atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was out of this world! For an appetizer we got these \"make your own springroll\" type of dish, which was tasty, and the egg rolls were tasty as well. For my main dish I had something that consisted of veggies, shrimp, pork, and crunchy noodles. Delicious! All the food was fresh and fabulously cooked. If you are looking for traditional, high-quality Vietnamese food, go to Pho Thanh!   **and ask if they will start staying open later, maybe if enough customers ask, they'll extend their hours till 10 pm :)"}
{"text":"Excellen Pho! Very authentic. No thrills kind of place, but good food, fast service. Best pho i have found in Phoenix"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst pho I have ever had and I've eaten pho at over a dozen different places in Phoenix. The spring rolls were far from impressive also."}
{"text":"THis is my favorite V resturant in Phoenix. I typically go here for lunch or dinner. The food is extremely well priced, and the food always tastes great. While their Pho is great, I recommend the Bun."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great food, love the tenderloin Pho, dont miss the bahn xeo, best in town.  Crap neighborhood, service is not the friendliest, go somewhere else for that stuff, if you want the best Vietnamese in Phoenix go here."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in the valley! Pho is amazing! Dumpling soup is so good too! And so many other things I can't pronounce!"}
{"text":"The food quality and price of this place is unbeatable.  However, the friendliness level of owner and waiters need to be improved. One time, I went when the restaurant was full. Standing by the door for 5 min, nobody talked to me. The other time, I got confused by spring roll and egg roll, so question the waiter when he brought the food. His attitude is like\"wtf, you ordered this. Don try to let us take it back.\"   I mean running a restaurant is more than swiping customers credit card. Bring some true happiness to the work you are doing..."}
{"text":"Tried the Pho chicken. Broth lacked flavor!!  But it was the standard beef broth not a separate broth. Wouldn't call this the best Pho I've tried, it was acceptable not great. The veggies were delivered long after the broth, so cooking of veggies was slow. Hot peppers were not hot.  Was expecting much better fuller flavored broth. Veggie spring rolls were good."}
{"text":"Very good Pho soup. Generous and tasty portions. If you're in the West Island and don't want to drive to Pho Lien, this place is a great alternative."}
{"text":"Tonight was one of my better visits.  It was a little rainy throughout the day so it was destined to be a pho night!  Part of the problem with this place is the absolute lack of parking for all of the businesses in this area.    I feel like my deepest road rager tendencies come out when circling like shark in this tiny lot with 12 spaces.  There was one time it was so bad I just gave up and left.  Not my favorite area at night, either, but sometimes I just gotta get my pho fix here!  The banh xeo is pretty tasty, but I would prefer it if they went a little easy on the bean sprouts.  Mine was made perfectly tonight, though.  So yummy!  The pho thai is usually hit or miss here for me.  Hard to compete with my MIL's,though :)  My husband got the cafe sua da (sp?) and he really enjoyed it.  Nice and strong without being overpowering."}
{"text":"Food is great like everyone else has helped emphasize. Location is divey but that makes it even better for the super hipsters! I go here at least once a week and it always impresses. If you are not well versed in this type of cuisine, try the #14 and an order of egg rolls! It's my go-to order and doesn't have anything edgy in it!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious, flavors are very savory. Enjoy visiting about once another and always worth it. Only criticism is that they did not have boba."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed/busy!  But the service was great and we got our food pretty fast.  I just got the pho and the thai iced tea and my friend got the broken rice dish and we shared an order of the spring rolls.  My pho was decent and the thai iced tea was good.  And the spring rolls were also delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good, authentic, better than the other places I have tried in Az,however the don't have grilled shrimp. Would go back again!  Got the vermicelli bowl- Got the grilled pork (it's processed) but it still tasted pretty good. And egg roles, for the price you can't beat it! Going to try the da vang I have been reading about next, we'll see which ones better ;)"}
{"text":"Here is the quick & dirty: The Pho is damn good and very reasonably priced. The rest of the food we got was just so so. That said, since I love pho, I would easily go back."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  It is delicious, and cheap.  You can't beat a lunch for under $5.  The spring rolls and the #12 beef pho are good if you're looking for a basic meal.  The cafe sua da is delicious, but you have to be patient for the coffee to drip down.  If you're looking to test your manliness, challenge yourself with #54."}
{"text":"This place is always busy but the soup is amazing. They also have amazing original coffee. The best Vietnamese food I ever had in my life. Please make sure you try the coffee."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying pho, and I was hooked.  After trying from a few other places since, I have to say I may not have become a fan had I not had the first three pho meals from here.  Awesome food, prices and service."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here! Food is always amazing! Don't expect any great service, it's a very interesting environment to say the least."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the West Island. Decor is dated but usually only do take out. Service is very quick."}
{"text":"I love the pho here! I've been here dozens of times and they're always generous with the meat. I get the chicken pho every time."}
{"text":"My experience with Vietnamese cuisine is limited to Pho Thanh and another place I dined at in Peoria.  Pho Thanh is my favorite of the two places.  I've been to Pho Thanh twice now.  Both times I ordered pho tai nam.  The dish is noodles in beef stock broth with slices of beef and brisket.  The bowl is dirt cheap (maybe $5 or $6).  Not only is the dish tasty but its easily one of the best values to be found at any restaurant in Phoenix and the surrounding area.  On my next visit I will expand my Vietnamese horizons and try something new.  The menu has well over 100 items to choose from.  Pho Thanh may not be in the best area and the strip center parking lot is small (and, sadly, filled with the vehicles of folks that have no clue how to park a car) but this place is a must visit.  If you're a fan of Asian cuisine in general or just looking to try something new. Pho Thanh is well worth your time."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese Food! Glad to have found the menu on-line at http://www.urbanspoon.com/u/menu/263688?p=0."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX.  I've been coming here since it was one little quiet place and now it's expanded and always busy because people have finally realized how good this place is. It's fast and cheap and delicious. Perfect for a chilly winter day.  Get the spring rolls and the egg rolls.  I always get the pho with sliced beef because it's so good but everything on the menu sounds terrific.  Park in the back. Much easier during the busy lunch hours too."}
{"text":"Simple, basic, good pho --- I get the pho with combo meats (tripe, tendons, meatballs, brisket, pork slices) and a side of egg rolls (deep fried, wrapped in lettuce). All for less than $10. What a deal! Service is fast and efficient. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The first time I come to Pho Thanh boulevard Des sources I like this soup very tasty we'll be come back again"}
{"text":"Very delicious place I love the atmosphere. Prices were amazing and the taste was delicious worth going. I can't waot for the next time I stop by and grab something pff their menu."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the service is atrocious.   Just a few examples from my latest and last trip to Pho Thanh:  1. The waiter did not ask if I wanted appetizers, drinks or dessert, and I had to ask three times for the drink and dessert menu.  2. I ordered a sparkling beverage and they added so much salt it was nauseating, didn't offer to replace it when I told them about it, and still charged me for it.  3. No one came to check on my table after my food was served, and I ended up having to retrieve my own to go boxes. The employees watched me box up my own food....  4. The cashier entered totals off the top of his head on an adding machine and then wrote (and charged me for) a different amount than was shown....   The food is good, but not good enough to make me willingly return here."}
{"text":"I like this place!  Its good as Vietnamese food your going to get in Phoenix.  During lunch and sunday morning sucks for parking.  Great food and low price.  Spring rolls are ok.  Order fresh coconut if they have it.  Also, coffee is good.  Combination pho which I order gets the broth right!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Walked in, had to take my own booster seat. Staff served us only 3 drinks thou we are party of 4. Request for another cup.. he gave us unwillingly. Food took the longest to come. When we asked the status, the server didn't even have the patient to stop and listen to us. Ordered our coffees and we did not even see it even after we finish our food! Horrible experience! I would rather go another Vietnamese restaurant than come back. Gave 1 star because there is no option to give zero."}
{"text":"Alright so, I had previously said that Khai Hoan in Tempe gets my vote for best pho in the valley, but having dined at the newly expanded Pho Thanh more than once now, I'll argue that there is room at the top for more than one champion.  First off, Pho Thanh has the BEST broth in the valley. There's no contest--I don't know how they do it, but they nail it every time.  Yesterday we started with some spring rolls and cafe sua da. Then, I think I ordered a 114? It had all the usual suspects: tender filet mignon, beef brisket, tripe, tendon, meatballs, plus all your typical add-ins as well. Since there were two of us we got an ample platter with plenty of FRESH jalapenos, sliced lime, bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, and even lemongrass! I am salivating right now remembering this bowl and how GREAT it was. The service was friendly and immediate, and they didn't hound us when we were done (you have to go up to the counter and tell them your table number to pay).  There was plenty of things the other patrons were eating that I need to checkout, primarily the young coconuts everyone was drinking (and eating). I also have never had the pleasure of trying pennywort, and Pho Thanh has it bubbling away on the counter.  I can't recommend Pho Thanh enough if you're into Vietnamese cuisine. If they don't get Best of Phoenix next year, then the people running the New Times are shitheads."}
{"text":"First, my wife hates this place.  I guess it is not fancy enough for her taste,  But this guy loves it!!!  I sneak away and make the drive from the 51 and 101 down to Camelback whenever I get the chance,  I love dives whith great food, and this place fills the bill.  THis week I struck again.  Always have the spring rolls with peanut sauce for $2.50 for 2 great way to start my meal.  THis week I had the pho with beef, tripe, tendons and more.  AFter adding all the sprouts, basil, peppers and more to the dish along with various hot sauces I dove in to heaven,  Even though I may never get my .water refilled or a visit from the wait staff after the initial order, I could care less.  That's what happens at a dive, but the food is outstanding and low cost.  Plus I can eat in peace and quite without havin got listen to my wife gripe about the ambiance.  Life is good."}
{"text":"Who am I kidding, sticking to my 4-Star rating? I come to this place several times a week and it's ALWAYS delicious.  I've tried their pho, their banh mi, their bun bo hue, and it's all top-notch. When it comes to Vietnamese cuisine in Phoenix, this is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"This place has become a family spot since we discovered it. The prices are amazing and the food is superb! I tried the boba thai tea (2.99), Vietnamese coffee, pho (reg under $6), spring rolls, and some other yummy dishes..still trying to work my way through the menu. They start getting pretty busy in the evenings after 7pm, so come a little earlier if possible."}
{"text":"I am new to Phoenix and was seeking a new Pho place to replace my favorite in Pittsburgh. Pho Thanh nailed it! Great flavor, amazing quality, fresh and delicious. Happy to find this place!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Bit of a language barrier. Pho, Spring rolls and iced coffee were all awesome."}
{"text":"This place is just plain great. If you want fancy its not gonna work out. If you want service to kiss your butt it aint gonna work out.  If you want great food then its gonna be a ok.  Have tried many versions of the Pho and all are great. The spring rolls are a delight, and the coconuts are a treat.  Its Pho-tastic!  Only complaint is that they close too early. If this was open till 2am on the weekends I would be there every Friday!"}
{"text":"In love with this place. The MOST authentic Vietnamese pho in town. This is where we go to get pho, even it's 45 mins away. Worth the drive! We usually get the Filet mignon special bowl. Spring rolls are wesome too. Cheap prices for awesome portion with a fair amount of meat."}
{"text":"I simply love this place! I find myself coming here at least twice a week for lunch and sometimes go back for dinner when I have to brag to my friends and family what I ate for lunch.  5 stars for price, cleanliness, fast and efficient service, and delicious food.  There's no other place in cenpho that you can pay less than 10.00 for lunch for TWO people!   The Banh mi is irrestible and filled enough with meat and veggies to be a solid steal for $2.25   The Pho-is PHO-licous!!!! Yes it leaves Da Vang, Maxim and 43 Express in the dust.  Another steal at just $4.50  The #59 Broken Rice Special is divine-especially if you want to get a little taste of everything for only $6.95  Great place for a great price!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my FAVORITE pho restaurant in Arizona! You can tell when a bowl of pho is good based on their broth and they really hit the mark with theirs! Their broth has the perfect richness and flavor. You can defiantly tell that they've been simmering their broth in the bones for hours. Yes, service here isn't that great, but I'm not here for excellent service... I'm here for the food. As long as I am getting my bare minimum with the service, I'm good! haha"}
{"text":"Vietnamese tea was delicious with soymilk. Generous portions. Good pho but lots of green onion. Pho was even better after being refrigerated and heated up the next day!"}
{"text":"Coming from a huge city filled with some of the best Pho and Vietnamese kitchens, I will say this place is AMAZING! Authentic and quality food! Fast service and family owned. Delicious!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN the best Pho in Phoenix! Extremely affordable, the service is amazing. I crave this place and their spring rolls. The portions are huge and they have everything you need to customize your Pho yourself."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. I would be able to eat there every day and never get tired of it! I've been to many pho places around the valley and this place has the best broth. Definitely the most authentic pho restaurant in Phoenix. I always get #12 with sly(marinated onion) on the side. I enjoy the expansive spicy dressings. Bonus! Milk Run opened next door."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!! I have been looking for a good authentic pho place for years in this state...nothing has come close to the places in so cal or portland than Pho Thanh....very good food and totally affordable!"}
{"text":"I dine at Pho Thanh regularly for the last 5 years and it is THE BEST Vietnamese restaurant in Northern Arizona (there are two just as good in Tucson but that's beyond the scope of this review).  I tried so many other Vietnamese restaurants in the greater Phoenix area and none comes close.  For those who really dig for real Vietnamese food - Try their sandwiches between Wed - Fri.  They usually run out of the sandwich supplies after Friday.  Just remember those tasty sandwiches will make you smell funny for a while...in case you sit really close to a sensitive coworker.  I can't think of any dishes not to try..they are all economical and authentic.  If I must complain on something then it would be the meat they use for Pho (the soup).  If you want it authentic then you can't ask for quality meats so it's a catch 22.  Otherwise, this restaurant tend to provide more varieties of veggies that go along with the soup.  We always get great services here, and yes you have to bring your bill to the check-out counter.  And no, please do not keep bothering the owner during the checkout process, you will just end up making other people behind you very pissed off.  My ex-boss embarrassed the *** out of the group by keep asking for samples on those \"green-looking drinks\"...not cool, don't do that."}
{"text":"The service sucks and the place was really hot and uncomfortable.  But the Pho is as good as have ever had."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had, hands down.  I won't pretend to be a Pho connoisseur but I do know good food when I taste it.  I've only been here a handful of times but I've noticed with every visit, I crave it a little more thereafter.  In fact, I'm craving it now and it's only 8 a.m.  I once heard that in Vietnam they actually eat Pho for brunch...  One of the greatest things about Pho Thanh is the build it yourself spring rolls!  It comes with a stack of rice paper, a bowl of water for dipping, a plate of meat and a massive mound of greens, limes and vegetables.  Throw it in, roll it up and dip it in fish or soy sauce, oh so good!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The pho soup i had was very greasy Taste like lard in it Service is not too friendly Server Never came by to ask me for more water Portion is small,hardly any meat in it,low Quality meat ,very chewy for well done beef"}
{"text":"A good place to go when you want a change of taste from Maxim.  Pho Thanh's serving size and taste was excellent.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  We had the noodle soup and spring rolls and both were excellent.    Only negative was my vietnamese drip coffee took forever to drip but such is the woe of life."}
{"text":"I love this place. My best friend and I love pho. Having Asian background we are very picky with our pho. So when she introduced me to this place I fell in love. My favorite is the spicy beef soup. You get so much meat and vegetables for a great price. Whenever we crave spicy beef soup this is our go to spot. In our opinion they have the best spicy beef soup. The service could use some work, but understandable since they are always so busy."}
{"text":"Easily a 5 star Pho place! Finally a second great Pho joint with no bells or whistles was discovered today upon Mark G's strong recommendation. I can announce that this place rivals if not a bit better than Pho Ngon. Everything from the broth to the meat was just prepared very well, no funky smell or taste.... just good. Period. Also, unlimited free tea refills with very reasonable prices across the entire menu. I tried their spring roll also, very good too.   Note: My 5 star in solely based upon Pho's overall taste. I'm not going to knock a star for the usual \"whatever\" service you get at these kinds of places nor decor. I do however pay attention to general cleanliness including their washroom. They pass the test for the last two.   Ok, so Pho Ngon in the east end and Pho Thanh in the west. Thanks again Mark G."}
{"text":"My first time here was a great experience. I loved the food & the service. I also liked that its a large space and plenty of room for large groups. Let me also say that ANYONE who is concerned with food allergies, and then complains on Yelp, is not going to get much sympathy. If you are needing special food accomodations, eat at home. Do  not eat out and then complain. Its rude to the establishment. ANYWAY - the only drawback is if you go at busy lunch time the parking can get a little tight. However, if the drivers patronizing this restaurant could realize that you need to relax - we'd all be better off - the restaurant isn't going anywhere. They have lots of interesting dishes that I could not even begin to pronounce, but I got my Beef & Vegetables with rice. It was tasty & a good portion. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Closest thing to my favorite place in Los Angeles California! My best friend is Thai from Thailand and every time she comes to visit me in phoenix she wants to come here to eat!! Great Pho!! Casual atmosphere. Noisy but great food for the price!!"}
{"text":"Really people?  Maybe the meat dishes here are good. That's the only way I can understand why this place has such a large customer base.  Initially, I was excited to see a Vegetarian section on their menu with about 6 items on it.  We got one dish with tofu & vegetables, and another dish with vermicelli and fake pork.  The tofu dish tasted like it was cooked in fish sauce, and aside from it not being truly \"vegetarian,\" the tofu was awful and the wheat gluten meat is something you can buy in a can.  The other noodle dish was so bland that we had to add FOUR different sauces to it, just to give it some kind of flavor.   I will give them props for being cheap...but we definitely will not be returning here.   Oh, and their parking lot reeked of trash-juice-smell."}
{"text":"Solid pho, and I don't even have to add the disclaimer  \"..it's good for Phoenix.\"  Subconsciously (or sometimes out loud) I'm usually comparing the quality of Phoenix restaurants to their counterparts in the LA area - I do this for burgers, ramen, carne asada, boba, whatever - and the food in question always comes up short.   But with Pho Than, the soup is not quite, but pretty close to, the kind of pho that you can find in LA.  Trust me, I've tried the pho numerous times at other valley restaurants - Pho Viet, Angelina's, Maxim, and especially Pho Avina (which is pretty good, but comes in a distant second to Pho Than), and the rich, aromatic, and greasy (in a delicious way) broth of Pho Than comes out on top.  And the price can't be beat either.  Two large bowls, 2-3 orders of egg rolls, a combo fried rice, and a Vietnamese iced coffee or two will all come in under $30, easy.  I've tried many of their broken rice dishes and chef specialties, such as the sizzling filet mignon and pork chop, but the value and flavor of the pho cannot be beat.    Service is nonexistent, and if you're not familiar with Asian waitstaff you might interpret the attitude/demeanor of the servers as rudeness or apathy, but don't let that dissuade you from trying this place out.  Don't let the location or exterior dissuade you either."}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated, as the exterior and location screams GHETTO.  Like, as in seeing the same crackheads chilling outside the door every time you come type of ghetto.    Back in our clubbing/blacking out in bathrooms/barfing out our nasal cavity days, this was the spot the next Sunday morning for a bowl of hangover soup.  I'd like to think those days are far gone but do still occur from time to time, but I digress.....  The fact that my peeps and I still frequent  this place just to enjoy the food as non intoxicated human beings, is a good sign.    + Pre apology to Pho Thanh and all other pho places and all the vietnamese moms, but my mama's pho is the best.  With that being said, this place has pretty decent pho.  I tend to like my broth with a liiiiiitle more fat, as I feel Pho Thanh's broth is more \"lean\", if you will.  But it's still full of the right flavors, none of which over powers the other.  It's pretty consistent and that's KEY.    + Hu Tieu Bo Kho ( Beef Stew with Rice Noodle) - recently, I've taken a liking to this particular dish.  I have been getting it every time I come here, which is every other week.  It's nothing like american  beef stew, which can be thick and heavy in texture.  Bo Kho is more soupy/watery, but its flavor is super rich without being too much, and has a slight sweetness that blends extremely well with all the spices and herbs.  I love to dress my Bo Kho with the sate paste, extra cilantro and bean sprouts, and I request the wide rice noodle instead of the regular ones.  +Com Tam (Broken Rice) - Their rice dishes have a good selection/variety of toppings.  I usually just  get the broken rice with pork chop, and also request an egg over easy on top. Soooo simple but delish.    +Eggrolls - Not out of this world, but probably the best I've had in a vietnamese restaurant.  +Chao Ga (Chicken Rice Porridge ) -  Ever heard of the saying... show me your friends, and i'll tell you who you are?  Well, show me your rice porridge, and i'll tell you if suck.  And Pho Thanh doesn't.  It's comparable to home made rice porridge, with the perfect amount of chicken broth flavor, consistency is not too thick or thin, and its actually RICE porridge, not a bland bowl of water with a few grains of rice floating around.    I've yet to try and explore other menu items but these are the ones that really stand out in my mind right now and just remember that my 5 star review is based off of these alone.  I didn't factor in service and ambiance, because there isn't any.  Don't expect anyone to come by to ask how your food is.  I think they know their food is good.  Don't expect anyone to refill your water unless they aren't busy, and they usually are."}
{"text":"Should have reviewed this a long time ago. When i lived in Phoenix went here once a week some times more. Pho is delicious always hot and full of flavour. At most vietnamese restaurants i usually get pho vegetarian. Ordered it here and it was ok. So i tried a tamarind hot and sour soup;  its called Canh Chua Chay it is really yummy,  tastes just like the name says hot and sour. The flavours play nicely on your tougue. And its satisfying and filling. Seriously its never been a disappointment. Fresh rolls are good,  peanut sauce is fine. Ive also had their fried rice and that is good too.  They have fresh coconut. In its natural shell. This is a point to make as not all Vietnamese restaurants carry the fresh young coconut. Pho Thanh is very close up their as one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in Az."}
{"text":"So I ventured back to Pho Thanh today with the mindset of trying something other than Pho. I went with the #59 Special Broken Rice with BBQ pork. Holey mother of all that is holey, what a killer dish. I'm pretty sure some Vietnamese dude was hammered one night and was like (in cool Vietnamenglish) \"What do I have in the refrigerator? I got some rice. I got some BBQ pork. I got some shredded pork. I got some meatballs wrapped in grape leaves. I got some scallions. and Ive got an egg.\" and in true drunk munchy fashion, concocted one of my favorite dishes.   The dish was perfect in every way imaginable. I did add a touch of soy for salt and some of the red pepper paste they gave me, but other than that it was poifect. My takeout lunch cost me $7.50, but I should say that it ended up costing me $over $500 because that's probably how much I'll spend this year going back all the time. Two thumbs up and a big ole Pho slurp to the dope Vietnamese drunk guy that, more than likely, invented that dish!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pho's in Phoenix. The egg rolls here are about the best around anywhere. The spring rolls are good also. I generally order the house pho and it is always great."}
{"text":"Was there last night.  Pho was a 2.5 on a scale of 5.  I had the one that costs a little extra with meatballs, tripe, brisket. Generous amount of meat, but you know what they say, Pho is all about the broth.  That's what makes it.  Every pho is made from  beef broth even the chicken pho.  And that wouldn't be bad if the broth was flavorful. Da Vang's broth is a 5 out of 5 but I decided to compare.  I had the spicy, salty shrimp with shells on.  They were ok but I didn't realize I would be eating the shrimp's caca in the process.  My guest had beef with snow peas.  It was spiced to his liking but the flavor just wasn't there.  Their prices are incredibly low and that's why I gave them an extra star otherwise it would be a one.  You get what you pay for.  Back to Da Vang for me!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and what a great prices, how can they pull it off. Ate there twice now and would live to go more often if I had the chance. Service is great and friendly. Great young coconuts with loads of juice and meat for a great pirce. The 1 star missing is for the gross high chair we recieved for my child. I had to go to the car to get a cover to have him sut in it. Also the floor and walls can use a serious scrub down. However the food is so awesome, I'll see it through, just here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to have a delicious bowl of Pho, or spring-rolls, THIS is the place to go to! They have a variety of soups and other dishes, great drip coffee, and bean desserts- just don't expect a warm welcome or friendly service to go with that! ;-)"}
{"text":"Excellent pho at a tremendous value.  Some of the best Vietnamese food in the Phoenix valley.  The service is great as well, the place is typically pretty busy and they work really hard to sit and serve everyone.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to Pho Thanh because I was in the mood for some great Vietnamese and the reviews won me over. I went on a Saturday about 11am and was a bit confused by the customer formed order line vs. paying customer line. We were pleasant enough to allow the next person in line to go through ahead of us and I placed my order for vegetarian spring rolls on rice vermicelli and egg noodles served with stir fry vegetables with NO TOFU. I waited off to the side by the take out cartons and was impressed by how quickly the staff got the food out to the tables and the fact that the entire restaurant was full, consisted of a mixed crowd and people obviously loving what they were eating. My food came about 15 minutes after I placed my order and I raced home to eat. Unfortunately, there was shrimp in my \"veggie\" egg rolls. My mother is deathly allergic, thankfully, I am not but I don't like shrimp at all. Luckily, I spotted them and just pulled them out. My veggie noodle stir fry had tons of tofu in it, so I pulled that out as well. The food was good but I was upset that they didn't really pay close attention to my order. I'll definitely go again, but I'll dine in, so if my order is incorrect, I can have them fix it. I'll also try Da Vang to see how they compare."}
{"text":"I really wonder why no one talks about how bad the service here is... when you talk to the waiter to ask for extra limes, they literally don't acknowledge your existence and walks away. The funny thing is they come back with what you ask for but I can't see how saying \"okay\" or \"sure\" would hurt them?   And then I don't know if it's because I'm Vietnamese and I have crazy high expectations but holy cow why does this place have such good ratings? Is it because it's cheap? Or did I order the wrong thing?   I ordered bun bo hue because I love that dish and the pictures on yelp looks amazing but definitely regrets. When the waiter placed my soup down he goes \"spicy\" and I'm thinking great, I love spicy but when I tried my soup, all I taste was extreme sweetness... I started adding the hot chili oil on the table and one after another, I ended up adding like 6-7 spoonfuls and it still wasn't spicy. I gave up and ate it the way it was but in total disappointment.   Our bill ended up being 25 dollars for both our food and an appetizer so pricing here is definitely not bad but I would rather pay more for better tasting food.   Definitely would not be back."}
{"text":"Food is always so delicious but for some reason, it's always so warm. Not sure if they have an AC unit in that place but they need to lower the t-stat for a more comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"I guess it could be a higher rating considering the Phoenix area, but taste wise, it's subpar.  The spring rolls were pre-made, probably during the morning or afternoon because it was cold from the refrigerator.  That killed the moisture and it was not filled with enough vegetables.  The pho tai broth was a bit too oily and lacked taste.  The noodles were okay, while the slices of beef seemed a bit old and chewy."}
{"text":"Stopped in while vacationing in Phoenix. Came in with my wife and 3 kids. Their Pho was very good and my wife said they had the best fried rice she had in a long time. In fact, my kids kept eating her food. This is definitely one of the better restaurants we tried while in Phoenix. I would come back again in a second!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I come here very frequently. The food is tasty and cheap. I have yet to try the pho, however, I do really recommend the bbq pork. It's really what you would expect from a hole-in-the-wall place. As mentioned before, your water will not be refilled, as it does get super busy."}
{"text":"This place has a good bang for you buck! Lots of soup for a good price. It's very fast pace to get you in and out which I don't like hence the 4 stars. They seat you right away and take your order almost immediately and the food is served within 15 minutes. Flavor is great as well as quality we had to take some home i can't imagine what the XL bowl looks like. Price and food matter to me so I'll be back."}
{"text":"So I went here because da vang was closed on Wednesdays, who knew.   I told my parents \"my friend swears by this place. Though last time I was here, it was just okay.\" And it happened again, its just okay.   The pho is not bad, but good luck trying to get more veggies. And they serve lemon not lime.   They are attentive, but in the end I don't think I'll be going back.  But who knows."}
{"text":"We just moved to AZ from California and could not find any good PHO here.  I was so excited to find this place, it was great! Fresh and lots of choices!"}
{"text":"First time visitor Sunday 11/15 seeking comfort in the ways of Pho and I left satisfied... The place was busy and wait staff were hustling about to ensure everyone was seated and served in a timely manner but I think there was some confusion about who was doing what exactly.   We ordered the Pho with sliced beef and an order of the pork and shrimp summer rolls.   My girlfriend had never experienced Vietnamese cuisine prior to this and I was relieved my picky eater actually liked it! There were some young men seated next to us that had these sizzling meat dishes brought to them like fajitas in a Mexican restaurant. It was that moment  when everyone looks up from slurping noodles with chopsticks to see what is coming out of the kitchen. I asked what they ordered and they said it was the shaken beef? Might try it next time?   The place is kept pretty clean with the exception of the bathrooms and I noticed the staff cleans the dining tables with standard Windex and they don't try to hide it.   Sidenote: We paid our bill and on the way out I overheard a woman wave the staff over to her table to point out there was a black hair found in her summer roll."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say you cant beat the price here.  $6 Pho, come on now!!  However, I wasn't too fond of the food itself.  I mean, it was OK but not \"I have to drive 45 minutes just so I can come here to eat lunch\" good.  We happen to be in the area and Yelp showed us the way.    The spring roll was meh ... not super fresh but it wasn't unfresh either.  Hard to explain but I definitely wouldn't get it again here and the peanut sauce was actually not good at all.  I was really disappointed with the sauce.  I ordered their meat pho and the flavor was good.  I definitely think the place is good enough to try but when we are in the area - which is not often - we'll prob find another pho joint to try out.  For the price and \"ok\" food, you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Consistently the food is good + cheap, and the service is fast.. If you are looking for the server to make cordial conversations with you, this is not the place, but they will explain the menu if you have any questions. We never wait too long for a seat, and it's one of a few restaurants that can accommodate large groups wo reservations. As for food: the fresh spring rolls (made all day long) are a light + delicious way to start the meal - I miss the old peanut butter dipping sauce... all the V-restaurants changed the recipe to a more \"starchy\" ingredients. Pho is consistently good with their signature light but flavorful broth. When I feel a cold coming, I nourish myself with pho-therapy here! Vermicelli rice noodle with pork + egg rolls is my go-to when I want to change it up a bit - it's really filling!  I really like pork chops with broken rice, but the meat tends to be more fatty than I like it, but I probably order it again. We make the 20mi+ drive to satiate our Vietnamese cravings."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for a second time (once dine-in, once carry-out) and it was delicious both times. I always get pho, my boyfriend has tried a few other things, everything is delicious and fresh and incredible. Service is fast and friendly. And you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho spots in Phoenix. Too bad it's like a 45 minute drive from me. Tastes like authentic pho and the price is right. Next door is milk run which is the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"The pho is incredible to me. It's actually the best I've had in Phoenix so far. Their thai iced tea is the reason I try to go regularly. Service is prompt. There is a slight language barrier but nothing that can't be fixed. You order. They provide. You eat and pay. There's not much communication between the workers but they're polite when there is. Overall, I love this place and wish it was near me. The restaurant seems small from outside and the place doesn't look fancy but the food is great and inside it is huge."}
{"text":"I will spare all of you with my Pho puns. Swearsies.   All of you who know me, understand that ethnic food is a staple in my life. Much like a good sandwich. I mean who doesn't love good meat, cheese and delicious bread....but that is a topic for another post.  I paid a visit to the West side of town for the first meeting of the AZ Yelp Supper Club. I got there a little early, so I seated by the nice gentleman who said, \"You are in the group of 30?\" HA.   I hung out for a little while and worked on my latest blog post...but I knew I had awesome company as soon as I saw CM Lindsey and several Yelpers walk in the door.   The menu has all kinds of good stuff. Pho, Bun, and various noodle dishes. Even Banh Mi! Score! This isn't your typical Pho house. You get it all here. Want chicken dishes? Bam. You got it. Seafood? It's yours.  I ordered the #1 Pho. You know the one. With the Tripe and Tendons. Only the brave should bother. Also, like a smart guy, I ordered the XL bowl since it was my day off. It was way too much. Oh well.  The broth was perfect. Not too oily. Piping hot. Sweat beading down my head. Everyone who ordered Pho on this 105 degree day had sweaty foreheads. The Vietnamese would be proud. Afterall, this is what people eat in the heat in Vietnam. It actually cools you off.   My Pho was so awesome, I nearly forgot to tell you about my appetizer....the #1 spring rolls. So delicious with shrimp and pork. Oh so perfect.   My total tab came out to just under 10 bucks.   Splitting a large check is not a big deal here. The staff is pretty helpful, and my return factor is high.   I live in Old Town Scottsdale. I am willing to drive 30 minutes...just for the Pho.   Yeah. That is happening."}
{"text":"Lately I've been  very disappointed. Not sure if it's just me or if something is lost in translation but the service and food is terrible now. Won't go back."}
{"text":"My biggest dilemma when I go to any Viet restaurant is that I can never decide what I want to eat.   Being Vietnamese myself, I have pretty high standards for Viet good, but Pho Thanh definitely has my approval.   Although their pho isn't the best compared to others, it's still pretty damn good. The broth is flavorful and full of flavor. The meat is cooked well and the herbs on the side are fresh.   I really like their Bun Bo Hue too. The soup is spicy and you can really get that seafood taste in the soup.   I come here whenever I have a viet food craving and they never fail to satisfy me af Pho Thanh."}
{"text":"Service has to be pretty bad for me to complain and let me tell you that Pho Thanh has some of the worst service. Come here for a bowl of hot pho, not for a local dining experience.  Waiters legitimately do not want to talk at all. A guy came by to take our orders and asked if we were ready, then proceeded to not mutter another word even when he didn't understand what we wanted. He managed to mime out hand signals that let us know to clarify what number or order we wanted. Mind you, the guy speaks English very well. When he returned with our food, we asked him to remove appetizer plates and he literally froze for a second before turning around to walk away without muttering anything at all. Then, when I was standing in line to pay, another waiter decides to take a shortcut between me and the guy in front of me and steps on my shoes without apologizing at all. I was the last person in line at the cashier and there was plenty of space behind me and only a narrow gap in front of me.  Some of the best local restaurants in Phoenix thrive because they offer a great customer experience along with their great food. Pho Thanh fails horribly at offering any customer experience. Each customer is simply another $6 bowl of pho that needs to be moved along promptly. I would've gave them 3 stars if their Pho was good but it was not as good as in the past. The beef felt tough and noodles did not seem fresh. I've had better from them before but I always prefer Da Vang.   For having to put up with shitty staff and get barely above average Pho noodles makes me not want to return here."}
{"text":"Vietnamese tested and approved. This place gets two yellow thumbs up.  I was happy that Pho Bang is finally gone because that place was what Vietnamese food tastes like on its way out. Anyway- so Pho Thanh...  Just got back from it and before I slip into a food coma, I thought I should review it first. Busy busy busy. That's pretty typical for a Sunday crowd. I came here with my real life friends and fellow Yelpers, Cori S. and Tim J., and Tim was pretty convinced that this place was gonna rock his world even before ordering because he didn't see any other white people. It must be good if actual Vietnamese people eat here.  And it was! Despite the fact that it was busy and service was slow, it was understandable. I never go to any Vietnamese place and expect exceptional service. So long as I have this kind of expectation, I'll never be disappointed, right?  Looking at their menu, they seem to have all the typical dishes offered at a Vietnamese place. I didn't see anything that jumped off the page so in a true test of authenticity- I ordered the mainland dish- a Pho Bo Dac Biet. Its usually #1 on most Vietnamese menus but its #11 here. It basically the beef noodle soup with the works, sliced beef, beef brisket, meatballs and tripe.   I waited for my food, sipped on my Vietnamese iced coffee and although it took a while to get to me, it was worth it. The broth was just right and not greasy/fatty like Da Vang's. The beef was fresh and the basil, sprouts and limes were clean.   Even though it took nearly 30 minutes for the food to make its way to me, I finished it in record time. My nose was running and I was sweating from the hot broth and the mass amount of siracha I added to the broth.  I will definitely be back to try out the other dishes. I had my eye on the Bun Bo Hue and Bo Kho, which are various beef soups/stews. I'll update you on those experiences later."}
{"text":"The worse Pho place I've been to yet. The atmosphere is very unwelcoming. The service is awful. I can't stress how awful the service was. They are not that nice and very impatient. From the time I was asked what I want to order I wasn't approached until I finished eating.  They give the soda in cans... which personally I can't stand.   And the Pho wasn't good. There wasn't much broth or beef. The flavor wasn't great and the noodles were soggy.  Honestly.... go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"  I say to what's available of what I've seen in PHX area.  With that said, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor.  The only thing that didn't rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches- can't vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either.  Besides that, If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh is my favorite Vietnamese place in the Phoenix area. Not only is their Pho very good, but their prices are super cheap, service is quick and friendly, and their menu is the most extensive of all the Viet joints I have tried out in the valley.   My go-to orders here included: Pho Tai Nam (beef brisket), an order of their fresh spring rolls, and their Bahn Mi. They also have young, fresh coconut juice and some pretty good vermicelli dishes. I've tried a majority of the menu over the course of 4 years, and you really can't go wrong. Strong, bold flavors, rich broths, and a very authentic feel.   While I have definitely had better (in California), you can have a whole feast for two people can be achieved for under $25...now THAT'S awesome. And for Phoenix...definitely a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"We just moved from San Diego which has tons of great Pho restaurants.  This is probably the best Pho we've had here in Phoenix.  The Pho soup has a good taste.  It was light on some of the meats and I don't necessarily like the big cubes of sausage but overall it was delish.  Service was fast and good and it was fairly packed with customers which is probably a testament to the tasty food."}
{"text":"Solid place for pho and cheap too! Definitely a no frills place and food is always consistent. I've many bowls of pho, including homemade, and their broth is up there with some of the best, good depth of flavor and beefy-ness. Some say Da Vang is better, but I disagree. Another favorite is the broken rice plate, get the pork chops, not patties."}
{"text":"If I could, I would have given this zero stars. There is no service, asked for water 5 times and we ended up having to get it ourselves. Our food came out wrong, and one of the orders never came out. There were 13 tables and two waitresses. We were the only big group. I understand that they are busy but it's not like everyone came all at once. The waitresses were rude and the food was not good. I ordered the pho and it was tasteless. I was told that the pho soup base was not as good as usual. I am definitely not coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"It took about 2 years of weekly patronage for one of the servers to greet us whenever we came through the door, but service/hospitality aside, we really like this place. The quality of noodles has become somewhat questionable in the last couple of months, but we keep going back for the hearty pho broth, the best egg rolls in town, and also for its proximity to Costco. Da Vang is perhaps better for its quality of noodles and the meat, but the portions are much smaller."}
{"text":"The best pho Place in AZ. I wish it was open every day. My 4 year old son always wants to go after church. My favorite is the pho DAC biet"}
{"text":"Yummy as always. We had eggrolls for an appetizer, I had banh cuon, husband had pho tai and my 15 month old ate the bo xao. There's not many vietnamese restaurants around here, but I'm glad this one is close by!"}
{"text":"From the outside, seeing the faded sign and run down building, if I were in LA, I wouldn't dare go in.  I went on a weekday at about 3pm, as you could see from other Yelpers' posting, they had plenty of tables. The day I went they had plenty of empty tables. But I was ushered to a small table right at the entrance. What the F**k!! I refused to sit there and demanded an inside table.  As others had said, it is hard to find half decent Pho in Phoenix. Since Vietnamese restaurants are few in Phoenix, so you wouldn't be surprised the services are at the low end of the spectrum compare with LA, SanFran, or Las Vegas.  The food is OK, 3Stars."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Pho, but don't let the looks of this place fool you. Service was prompt, the food portions were \"take-home\" huge and the flavors were perfect.  I had a basic steak and noodle bowl and spring rolls, everything was heavenly! The steak was cooked to perfection, the broth to meat, to noodle ratio was very good and the large size is more than enough for 2 people. It was hard to stop eating this meal, but i had to or I was going to explode.  The decor is minimal and this place is setup for fast service either dine-in or take home. Pay at the counter when you are finished and grad a togo order on the way out!  Check it out, you would be disappointed."}
{"text":"It is really hard to find good Vietnamese food in Arizona. No, really, it is. Pho Thanh really hits home for me with its rare offerings like Thit Bo Cuon La Luop (Vietnamese beef in grape leaves) or its pork blood porridge.  \"Wait, what, that's disgusting, pork BLOOD porridge? Russell, that's disgusting!\" Hey, foods from foreign cuisine tend to challenge our pre-conceived notions of what is acceptable and what isn't. Ask any Vietnamese person, they've had it before. it's not that bad, in fact, some ascribe the texture to tofu.  But I'm digressing; Pho Thanh has the word \"pho\" in it, so logically, you come in here expecting some damn good quality pho. And damn, is it some good quality pho! I get the special combination beef pho, which has everything from rare steak to brisket to tripe in a delicious broth that's been cooked for hours before the restaurant opens at 8:15 AM daily. Not to mention the plate of veggies including bean sprouts, basil and lime. AND, what most pho places in Phoenix will not serve on the vegetable platter is the infamous \"saw tooth herb\" which is perceived as possessing healing qualities. I'm not sure how true that is, but damn, does it go well with the beef meatballs in Pho Thanh's pho soup!   I also frequently order the broken rice dishes. Man, not only are they vibrant in color, but they're just so damn good. You get a combination of meats, vegetables, rice, soup, vegetables again, it's just so damn good.  Look, come on in, sit yourself down, and order your grub. BTW, look at the menu online ahead of time, these types of traditional Vietnamese places will NOT be patient with you; you're there to eat, they're there to get you to eat quickly and turn the table just as fast."}
{"text":"Really good Pho!  Not the best location but that doesn't affect the rating. I'd deff go back.  I suggest they close the door to keep flys out though."}
{"text":"This place disappoints me more and more each time. I used to love this place, but each time the food gets worse and the price gets higher. I just got the combination pho bowl and its missing ingredients, its half filled, and noodles were starched. Unfortunately, i wont be returning."}
{"text":"Best pho in Phoenix. Hands down. And you'll know the minute you walk in... They're always busy. From the time they open until the time they close and you'll probably have a few minute wait if you're not here on an off-time (ex: 3pm), but even then, most of the tables will be full. The broth is great, the meat is great, the prices are great... Great meat to noodle to broth ratios (some places have not enough or way too many noodles or not enough meat). The employees rush around pretty tentatively and whenever you're ready to pay, as with many Vietnamese restaurants, you go up with your table number and pay at a counter. Did I mention great prices?   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pho Thanh is settled in the corner of a little strip mall off 19th Ave and Camelback. I've passed it numerous times, but never stopped in. What a delight.   The lighting is great and cheery, and the restaurant itself is big and roomy. The staff is meticulous and helpful. I always get the same thing when I get pho, regardless of restaurants, but the expansive menu gave me pause.   I went here with a fellow nerdy friend. We both got spring rolls-him, vegetarian, me shrimp. Oh my goodness. Amazing. The peanut sauce was good (although, shhhh, Pei Wei's sauce is better), and the rolls were crazy fresh. Jose said that his rolls were great, as well.  Jose ordered some fancy curry pho, which he said was good, but remarked that he wished the chicken wasn't still on the bone. I always hope for charbroiled shrimp on my pho, but they only had boiled. I chose that, and it was good. As per the usual with pho, the serving sizes were massive, and I got full pretty quickly. I was surprised that carrots didn't come with the mint and sprouts, but it was still good. Our server was attentive and made sure the water was full. Although, be warned--when you order soda (like my friend did), it's a can of soda, not from a fountain!  All the staff is congenial, the food is great, the prices are extremely reasonable, and the spring rolls are out of this world. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Waited half an hr to get service and had to ask three times to get a soda. Place wasn't really that busy. Better customer services is missing here. Food was not great either that's the worst part."}
{"text":"I went there more than 5 times, with friends or only myself! Good food, fresh and great price! If you are looking for Pho/ Vietnamese food, this is the restaurant you should visit!  For the neg side: It is parking lot, the one is the back is very dirty with trash every where! They should clean and make more parking lot for customers!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love pho. If it is a Sunday, pho. If it is cold (doesn't happen to us a lot in PHX), pho. If we just want soup, pho. This has become our go to place.   Also, if I haven't stuffed myself to the max, I love to have bubble tea to go as dessert. This place happens to be right next to an adorable bubble tea spot, Milk Run, so save room!  ***I have seen some posts commenting about the service. It is true we have experienced more attentive service, but for us the food is worth it. I"}
{"text":"Didn't really expect much because we have pretty good Vietnamese food here in town but we gotta have a pho place for the kids while on vacation so read some reviews and found this place. Yup, not much to see from the front. Did make us hesitate as to how safe it was here. Was planning to go look around at the Asian store next door but by the looks of it, we declined. There's 2 entryways to this restaurant but one is locked so it was odd coming in. But when you go in you can tell it's popular. It was packed but funny thing is and a usual indication of how authentic a place is for us, this place had no Asians sitting and eating. Which made us wonder oh no it's not gonna be good. Another funny note was that they had these 8 seater tables and good thing our family is big because we sat together but the table next to ours, we saw them seat 2 different families right smack next to each other. Suffice to say they weren't comfty with that arrangement lol we wouldn't have been either. This is a usual thing in China but not here lol  Anyways the food. It made up for the oddities and slight not as clean or vibrant restaurant. We didn't expect too much because Asian restaurants aren't usually that clean but this one wasn't that bad. No sticky seats or tables or too gross toilets.   Again sorry, the food. Ok wow. Was impressed. We have great phos in Austin but I liked my pho here at Pho Thanh. The soup base tasted so clean and you can tell it was boiled down from the beef bone for a long time. I liked the chewiness of the noodles too. It was different than pho back home. My kids preferred their pho here but I actually really liked it. My husband loves banh xeo, that pancake stuffed with shrimp and sprouts and it was marvelously done here. Huge n filling. Another surprise was the banh mi. Wow it was good like really good. My son wished he knew and would've just gotten couple of those instead of the pho. My daughter's grilled pork over rice was unique. Not the usual grilled pork you may think but caramelly and crisp. She loved it alot. We got leftovers from her.  Overall it was a yum. Yes cooks got my order a bit wrong adding cilantro n mixing up the phos but all good because food was good n waitress was apologetic. The male waiter or owner was odd n gruff but hey to be expected :)  Anyways, glad we found this place and do recommend. Wish we saved room for their dessert or drinks but headed to Snoh for their ice;)"}
{"text":"It's not the best pho I've had but it was decent! Really busy place!! Customer service isn't the greatest, but their prices are a really good!"}
{"text":"As a first timer, I was impressed!  I am hooked on PHO now and I must say, for sure going back to this place.   The atmosphere was great. The place was packed with smiley faces as it looks like everyone has been enjoying their food.   The service was great and straight up. What you see is what you get :) They were really fast as well.   My favorite of all was their Vietnamese coffee. It was the BOMB.   I am for sure going to be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Pho Thanh as well as my 1st time eating Vietnamese food. The restaurant is small and most of the tables were full so that's a good sign.  I was pleasantly surprised with our food & dining experience. I was not sure what to order so my boyfriend helped me pick something since he has eaten Vietnamese before. I ordered the lemongrass chicken; it was a little spicy but not over powering. He ordered some Pho, a pork sandwich and some spring rolls, all of which were good as well. We are both excited to go back and try some different items."}
{"text":"I almost like this place but, the people is not friendly and is always trying to rush you eating and the order takes so long. the last time i ordered, my spring roll to go was forgotten and i had to pay for rice that did not come. i bought thai tea and it was full of ice. when i asked if they can refill, they said $2.25 which was the full price of the order. it was a waste of money. i will say, the food is good though...2 star for the customer service that sucks."}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful!  Clean and busy but fast... Lots and lots on the menu,  toy can substitute meats with chicken if you ask... There's a Special board on the wall too... Next door to the Asian Market so if you like your dish you can go get some ingredients!"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised with the updated touches in Pho Thanh.  I used to go here all the time when it was Pho Bang, and stopped because it got to be a little grimy.  This place was packed!  It was a Tuesday for lunch at 12 pm.  There was no place to sit!  I got squashed in between a table with people all around me, but that's okay...I settled in quite nicely and my surrounding neighbors proved friendly.  I didn't need a menu...I seldom do when I eat Pho.  I ordered my traditional fare: Pho Tai with Iced Condensed Coffee.    I looked around at the changes.  No more dust caked on the wall, new photos and pictures, and the addition of a new staff.  The place seemed better lit and had a better vibe than any other time when it was Pho Bang.  My food arrived quickly.  The soup bowl was HUGE!  I asked for a fork (yes, I embrace my Caucasian side) to use in combination with the soup spoon.  I added in my Siracha sauce, Hoisen sauce, and the wet spiced red peppers.  Added in touches of lemon, jalapeno, bamboo shoots, and cilantro.  Give it a little stir, and POW.  Upon the first taste I did notice that this was a little bit more oily in comparison to other beef broths from Pho that I have had in the past.  I was disappointed in the additions (or lack there of) of the green onion and white onion.  Side note:  if you are a beef lover, ASK FOR MORE BEEF IN YOUR SOUP.  There was an okay amount provided, but I feel that there could have been more slices.    Aside from that, no complaints!  I couldn't finish my soup (like always) so it proves that the portion was definitely hearty.  The coffee was amazing, and always is, and still to this day is the strongest form of coffee around (aside from Turkish/Arabic black tar coffee).  There was a mixed crowd of people in here, which I was glad to see.  I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants in the past, all alone, and was the only non-Vietnamese person in the restaurant.  All sorts of cultures and ethnicities were present."}
{"text":"This is honestly the Best Pho soup in Arizona and I have been nearly everywhere! Thai food and Pho soup are my 2 favorite things to eat becides salads and veggies!  Pho Thanh has big giant boals of mouth watering pho soup with amazing broth that will make your nose run (after you load it with all your fresh herbs) and your heart warm. They are not the friendliest people there, but I don't care, the Pho soup is freakin amazing and that's ALL I care about. I truly have not been to a Japanese restaurant that gives you good service anyway, so I would never review on their service. Just try the Pho soup here, it's totally worth the drive no matter where you are coming from. Also, the egg rolls are awesome too, not the spring rolls, the egg rolls. I'm not downing the spring rolls, I just haven't ordered them so I can't give an opinion either way on those. Thanks and have a Happy Day! Fay"}
{"text":"My first time eating here and I'm definitely coming back! It had been a while since I had great Vietnamese Phô after I had left Hawaii.  It's a family owned restaurant, very clean, friendly with outstanding service. The prices are perfect. I ordered the Phô with beef broth, sliced brisket and meatballs and ordered the Shrimp and pork rolls. The ingredients were so flavorful I couldn't stop eating! The soup had a perfect balance of spices and ingredients.  The restaurant reminded me of most Phô places I had frequented in Hawaii. Long tables with all the condiments, spoons and chopsticks to serve everyone seated. The staff were really friendly and quick with service. This place is the epitome of \"hole in the wall\". Nothin fancy outside of the building, but when you enter the place you'll be in for a real treat! I'm definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Vietnamese restaurant. With so much to offer, one cannot resist the temptation of ordering more and more! I personally love the pho noodle dishes along side with my favorite shrimp spring rolls! The service is a bit shabby and is not the full   Dine in experience that most would hope for, but hey, the food makes up for it!   I have personally eaten my share of pho and let me tell you, this place is perhaps one of the best! And if you like sweets, try the ice Thai tea! Yum yum yum!   My only complaint is the parking lot. My advice is to watch out for other cars, seriously. It can get extremely crowded!"}
{"text":"My buddy Rodney took me here a few weeks back and I'm just now getting to review it..  I'd had Pho a few times about 10 years ago back in Boston and despite the fact that I'm a HUGE fan of most Asian cuisine -- Vietnamese didn't \"Pho-lly\" do it for me.  Bad pun...good bun!  ;)  Pho Thanh is a delightful little hidden gem of a place, nestled into the end of a skanky strip mall.  There's an amazing Asian grocery on the other side of the plaza which you MUST check out (and walk off your meal).  I tried  a few things with Rodney that day, including #68 Com Tam Tau Hu Dac Biet (broken rice with shrimp cake wrapped in bean curd skin, bbq pork, shredded pork, crab-egg cake and all topped off with a delightful fried egg on top.  It was a lot of food!  I also tried the pho beef noodle soup (#14 pho tai bo vien) with sliced beef & meatballs.  Addictive!!  I went back 2 weeks later with my buddy Steve and got more #14 soup....I'm now officially in love with that soup!  It's a HUGE bowl of broth & vermicelli noodles and comes with a side platter piled high with fresh herbs, citrus and some very piqued pepper slices (beware)!  Contrary to the rest of the plaza, the place is clean, the decor sparsly amusing/sad remnants of the proprietors previous life in Viet Nam, I supppose.  There is a killer poster I'd love to have that looks like it was produced by the either ministry of tourism or ministry of production that shows a woman with 3 brightly colored balls of yarn  (would someone please take a pic of this and post it to Yelp!?!?)  The staff is super nice and comped me a swig of a most amazing fresh pennywort drink.  It glows vibrantly green as it sloshes & swirls within a juice dispenser at the counter.  Tasted fresh (like wheatgrass juice) and left an aromatic effervescence on my tongue for a few moments after swilling it down.  Prices are super reasonable (most items between $4.95-6.95) and  I haven't left hungry yet!  Props to Rodney for pushing my gastronomic envelope and getting me hooked on a new local fave!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, I cannot wait for my next trip back to eat there again."}
{"text":"This is the best pho in phoenix but don't expect much from the actual restaurant. If you're coming for the ambiance don't bother but if you want some AMAZING pho this is the place! We went around 3 on a Sunday and the place was PACKED. i had never seen so many people eating at such a random time in the afternoon but the food was still out very fast. we got ours to go and the containers were spill proof which is really important. The servers speak very little english but this wasn't an issue as long as you don't have too many special requests. The to go portions were huge!! The pho ga (chicken pho in beef broth) is honestly the best pho i've ever had. it also has connecting doors to the tea and ice cream place next door which is equally delicious! definitely check both places out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. I grew up going to Da Vang but for some reason, I like coming to this place more. Egg rolls and banh xeo are definitely some staple appetizers to get. Every time my mom wants to get together and grab lunch, we come here. I've even introduced this place to some friends and they love it too! It gets busy around lunch time so sometimes, there's a wait for a table but people get in and get out pretty quick."}
{"text":"The pho seems to have gone back to its normal awesomeness so I guess it was a bad day for the chef or he called in sick. It is still my go I place for pho."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a Big Fan of this place and all the yummy items that they serve. The menu here is very large and the prices are very reasonable. The hardest part may be deciding what to order if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.  Been waiting a long time to visit this place. Seen a lot of great and happy reviews. Just happened to be in the area and had to check them out.  Both inside and outside are very simple and basic. This could be how they keep the cost down and still deliver great quantity and quality. I was surprised how large the inside eating area was and the large amount of slurping customers enjoying their meals. Nice!  Usually get the Pho with everything and in the largest bowl they serve. Here it is the #11 and it is huge. Decided to try out the Spring Rolls as well. This is always a good test to compare against other similar places.  Both the Pho and the Spring Rolls were good. Really liked the soup and can't wait to come back and try some of their other tasty choices. Got my eyeballs and taste buds set for some spicy Bun Bo Hue next.   Service is friendly and you may need to wave one of them down to get seated. When you are done you simply get up and pay at the register. This is pretty much the normal routine in these type of restaurants.  Bring a hearty appetite and get ready to leave feeling full. I was able to get out of here with a crisp $10 bill and was concerned that I might explode. DYN-O-MITE!  4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm indeed a fan-best pho so far in Phoenix.  Yes, it's over 100 outside, but pho has a special place in my heart/stomach (and it seemed very popular with the other diners as well). I went this afternoon with three of my buddies and was lucky enough to sample a number of dishes.  First, I should say this place was VERY busy even at 11:30 on a Sunday.  The spring rolls and egg rolls were great, as was my pho tai and my buddy's lemongrass chicken. Service was a little slow but really-this place was PACKED.  Mostly with Asian people, a good sign. I never dined at Pho Bang, but I will certainly return to this restaurant as it's hands down the best Vietnamese spot I've tried in the Valley."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was pretty enjoyable.  It was exactly what I wanted in a vietnamese restaurant- fairly skethy neighborhood, questionable things on the front counter, and lots of asian people!  All signs of a legit vietnamese place.  We got spring rolls for an appetizer and it was served traditional with the lettuce.  My date and I both got pho.  I got chicken and he got brisket.  Both were really good.  Not the best ever, but good.  Prices are so cheap!  Its hard to find good asian food in general in Phoenix, especially vietnamese so I was elated to be introduced to this place."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! It is not in the best of neighborhoods or very fancy, but the food is authentic, tasty and priced very cheap. I love it! I have gone around a tried others, always comparing to Pho Thanh, can not find any better!"}
{"text":"Best spot ever. Fresh food, fast service and cheap. If your a soup lover it's the place to be. I usually have the chicken soup, huge bowl for $ 6.50."}
{"text":"It was crowded. Crowded is always a good thing. Parking is a pain in the azz but the good makes up for it. There is also a good supermarket next door. And an ice cream place.  Get the Pho it's yummy. Get some spring rolls they're also yummy. Price is excellent! Lots of fun atmosphere inside so eat in and relax."}
{"text":"Only came here because DA VANG was closed and I wanted pho, this is the 2nd time I been here, first time many years ago, it was real busy and the pho broth was watered down, today it was again real busy, customer service is poor, took a while to be seated,  place looks messy, the waiter never refilled my water, \"god sakes it's 110 degrees outside\" I got the pho #113 again it tasted watered down, my noodle were over cooked/ soggy, also got #59 rice plate, the meat was NOT fresh, it was hard chewy, rice was old, my wife got a vermicelli bowl and her noodles and vegetable were not fresh, our whole dinner was not fresh, maybe it's so busy that they don't have time to make a good meal, anyone that says this place has the best flavor clearly has no taste in pho or is Americanized as hell. Plus outside you get those 2 usually homeless Asian guys following you asking for change."}
{"text":"Don't let the ghetto shopping center steer you away...it's a great place.  Definitely a no frills type place...this is the real deal.  It was very evident by most of the patrons actually being Vietnamese, you know it must be good.  You just walk in and sit anywhere that's open and someone will bring you their menu which is quite extensive.  I had my favorite, which is Pho Tai.  The broth was perfect, and had a pretty complex flavor profile.  Hard to explain, but some pho broth's are very 1-dimensional...this one was exceptionally flavorful.  They don't skimp on the meat either, which some places tend to do.  I've been to Vietnamese restaurants all over the valley, and although I have still never been to Da Vang...I'd venture to say this might be the best pho in Phoenix.  Tastes darn close to the stuff you get in CA, in Garden Grove/Westminster/Little Saigon.  Also, it is dirt cheap! $4.50 for a big delicious bowl of pho tai....yum.  I'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"All I can say is I love their Pho and wonton soups. Also their Thai Tea is to die for!! If it wasn't a crazy drive from my place to this restaurant I'll be there at least every other day at least!! ;)"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious, affordable and the service was great! The ambiance is so-so but over all, I would recommend this to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Really really love this place.  Just know they are closed for certain Vietnamese holidays and during the week.   The people packed from wall to wall is enough said that this place is great.  Great pho,  good band mi and good cha gio. Menu has a ridiculous amount of items on it so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been telling me that we should go there, as I had never been. Well, on our first visit what do I find in my lemongrass chicken?! A hair. I went to bring it to someone's attention and was offered a replacement dish and it was taken off the bill. No apology was received. Not to mention their service was absolutely awful. Never coming here again. Ever."}
{"text":"\"The worse the service, the better the food.\" Not sure who came up with this rule of thumb for Vietnamese restaurants, but it sums up our dinner tonight pretty well. Pho Tanh's charm is in its authenticity. It's as if the entire restaurant-from the employees, to the chopstick caddy on the table, to the pennywart juice in the soda fountain-was cut and pasted from Vietnam to Phoenix. It seems like a lot of other people have discovered it as well, because it was packed tonight with a mix of Vietnamese and people and miscellaneous others.   All in all, you get a pretty good travel experience for just $10. Go at least once for the cool experience and good food!"}
{"text":"I like this place but several times I've been here, I've been seated next to the window and its freaking hot while you're eating pho, I've asked to move but they just give you a dirty look. These people needs to take class on proper etiquette while working in the service industry. They threw my plate of spring rolls on the table and walked away.  Never did they once asked I needed anything. I'm not one to ever complain but there comes a time when things need to be said. I'm Vietnamese as well and I'm in the service industry also, being polite and giving your customers the best customer service is what's all about! These people needs a lesson and they need it now"}
{"text":"Very good food, busy restaurant with very diverse customer base.  Table service is a little hit/miss but it was our first time so maybe we will learn how they do things here.  The parking lot is busy and be aware of a few of the ones hanging out.  We will certainly be back and our friend that was with us will come to, after her very first Vietnamese food experience!"}
{"text":"The good is authentic and priced fairly. There may be a little bit of a language barrier with the staff, but the service is consistent and fast. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant on the corner with very low prices for the amount of food given, but also at the cost of cleanliness/neatness.  I was seated at a table with the the workers' soda cans, a child's cup, and napkins that weren't cleaned up despite the place not even being close to full.  The gentleman at the register was polite, but my server was anything but.  He plopped the menu on the table and kept sighing whilst leaning on a high chair in between waiting/clearing tables and didn't utter a word to us.  There was a lot of garbage on the floor... some food scraps, napkins, chopstick wrappers, and dirt.  The food was decent overall with generous portions and pretty tasty pho.  The pho was served as I'm used to with a side plate of herbs, bean sprouts, and hot peppers.  The broth is a bit oily and could use a little more depth, but for the price it's good enough.  The spring rolls were alright, the proteins within lacked seasoning, and the sauce was your typical peanut variety which provided them with a pleasant flavor.  Proportionally, however, the spring rolls could use a thinner rice paper wrapper, more greens, and less noodle (in my humble opinion).  Admittedly I was a little put off due to the lack of tidiness which probably has skewed my review in a negative fashion, but cleanliness goes a long way.  I will probably try Pho Thanh again before making my final decision on whether or not it's a place I'd like to frequent... so until then - \"A-OK\" it is."}
{"text":"This place is one of many in the area with good pho, but this has the best in my book. There is something you need to know before you go. The servers are not what you would get at a traditional American restaurant. They take your order and bring your food. That's it. You want more water, you walk to the water station and get more. You want to-go containers, you walk over to the rack and get them. It's very low key, which I know is a turn off for a lot of people. But I go for the food. I have no problem doing things for myself. Prices are good, service is fast, and food is delicious. That's a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is not fancy but the food is tasty and decent."}
{"text":"I've been spoiled with good viet food in San Jose and LA/OC.  This place was just ok.  Of course, everything's relative so maybe I'll adjust after trying some other viet places around.    Ordered bo nuong la nho (beef wrapped in grape leaves), com tam tau hu ky  thit nuong (broken rice with shrimp/beancurd and bbq pork), and canh chua ca (tamarind soup with catfish). Canh chua was pretty good - nice balance of flavors with okra, pineapple, bean sprouts, etc.  The beef/grape leaves had a good flavor but the meat itself was a little bit dry.  The bun noodles it was served with was dry. One of my pet peeves at vietnamese restaurants it old bun that has been sitting out. It's cheap and takes a few minutes to boil...just make a new batch! Really disappointed in the broken rice.  The bean curd was stale, not crispy like it should have been.  The thit nuong flavor and texture were weird -  def not like any thit nuong I've seen before.  If I'm back I won't be ordering that again. I haven't tried the pho broth but my friend said it was decent on a previous visit.    Price was where it should be (cheap!) for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The place is pretty large and had a lot of guests during our visit.  Don't expect great service. If you need something, flag them down and ask.  That's just how it works."}
{"text":"This place has expanded  twice and now seats 200 customers  . The place is busy but food  cones out quickly. We normally order 113 noodles  with beef filet. The portions are large. And the soup very flavorful. We also love their  salty  fish fried rice. You have to try the fresh coconut water. You need to get there early ."}
{"text":"I have never been a true Pho fan until I went to Pho Thanh, the broth is very complex like Blake B said; the fixings were huge like Nader A stated.  First time I went I went with a friend who is \"Pho-crazy\" and he introduced me to Pho Thanh; then I took my roommate who is \"soup-crazy\" and he fell in love with Pho Thanh.  Next time I have to take one of my best friends; but he's a pescetarian; but he loves spice asian food."}
{"text":"Love the new improvements! They've taken over the adjacent store space so the restaurant is now bigger than ever. Service is always fast and the food is excellent and inexpensive, as always. This place is now the standard by which I judge all other Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"We had the spicy seafood hot pot and egg rolls last night and they were amazing. The service is also much better than it used to be."}
{"text":"The food here is a miss and hit. I am Vietnamese so I know how Vietnamese food are suppose to taste like and Pho Thanh just doesn't know how to cook some of their foods. Heres why:  Bun Rieu: The broth was bland! Bun Rieu is suppose to have a sweet savory taste from the crab mix and there wasn't any crab mix in it. The tofu tasted like it was left frozen for a long time because I could still taste the residue of the tofu being frozen for a long time. The bowl looked so messy like it was toss around before serving. After all, Bun Rieu was not good at all.   Cam Tam Dac Biet: I also got my friend a rice plate and I will say, the rice plate here is pretty good. Give you the right amount of food and rice to satisfied your taste. No complain about their rice plate.   Service: The service here is so HORRIBLE! The waiter gave us our food was so bad. He like literally slid our food and toss the silverware on the table. Gave us our food and did not say anything at all. He even had such a grumpy face like he was not happy with his job. Terrible service here. I absolutely do not like the service here at all. After several visits I am only writing a review because of their service."}
{"text":"While being in the West valley, this is a pretty long drive for me. Although I know that some can agree that their own mother/ grandmother or someone in their family that they make the best pho and that going to somewhere else isn't just good enough. Then there's Pho Thanh, I gotta day it's pretty good, not close to my mother's pho but it hits the spot. The portions are big, the prices are decent compared to the ones in Arizona and I usually end up satisfied everytime I'm here. It's a good spot to eat when my mom isn't making pho. I recommend the Pho Dac Biet aka the (phuc dat bich), and if you just want to keep it simple order the pho bo vien (meat ball) or pho tai  (thinly sliced beef)  #CertifiedBanger"}
{"text":"My favorite place was closed today, so dropped in here for lunch.  Today I ordered pho, (yum) went for the #11, with brisket, meatballs, tripe, along with the usual noodles, etc.  It was the expected  delicious bowl of goodness!  Be sure to remember your table number, along with the order, as it is standard practice here to just go to the cashier to pay.  It's the honor system at work."}
{"text":"Best pho in the city! And better than many of the places I've been to in San Francisco! Pho is my favorite food so anywhere I go I have to try as many places and find the best. This place is by far the best! It's fast, cheap and so so so so delicious! By itself it is refreshing and powerfully flavorful! Only downfall to this place is that I don't live closer!"}
{"text":"Bahn MI was just O.K., Pho again was just O.K. I don't get it they have great reviews. Please help us fid great Pho, Bahn Mi, & Ramen in the greater PHX area."}
{"text":"I love when my preconceptions are proved wrong. I have actually heard a lot about this place and I know what Pho is but actually never tried it until yesterday. Walking up to this place, you have the misconception that this place will not be that good because it is on the end of a run down strip mall and you think to yourself if the outside looks likes this how good could it be inside? Much to my amazement, my ignorance turned to bliss.  Upon walking in the inside was much bigger than I thought it was going to to be, it was packed and everything was very clean, a pleasant surprise. I ordered the shrimp spring rolls and the Pho, that consisted of tripe, meatball, and brisket. The spring rolls were divine. Nice crisp, fresh, clean, and aromatic flavors. I could have ate about eight of these things. Upon finishing the spring rolls, I knew it was a sign of good things to come.  Then came the Pho. Realistically, Pho is a soup, and I didn't understand how a soup could be perceived at phenomenal. Once again I was wrong. I tried the broth first, a mouth full of deliciousness. The rice noodles were divine, the meatball I thought was OK though, and the brisket was a little tough, but that is too be expected when it's sitting in hot broth all day. But overall a more than solid bowl of awesomeness, and I was a happy camper. What element I think I loved the most was that the Pho was filling, but you don't feel like you overate. A filling meal that has a very light touch to it, which I enjoy.  The service was a little clumsy, but I can oversee that, since they delivered on the meal which is what were really there for. I'm am going to stick with giving this place a four star rating simply due to the fact that I have never had Pho before yesterday and I don't know whether or not I have had the cream of the crop, or if there is better Pho in the valley. I guess I will have to try more Pho elsewhere, but I will be back to Pho Thanh."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for the food and only the food, there is no ambiance nor is the service very welcoming. While there are other Vietnamese restaurants that offer the same authentic dishes with friendlier faces, the 4 stars is for offering a few dishes that you can't find at the other places, and which is why I come here. One of my favorite dishes here is the table grilled beef, you are given a individual grill to cook the beef and all the fixings to make your own spring rolls. At $11 it's a generous portion and can feed two. Another favorite is the sugar cane shrimp - Choa Tom. This is also a \"make your own\" dish, but with lettuce wraps instead of rice paper and lot's of fresh veggies and herbs. While the service is curt it, is also fast, so a great lunch spot if you're looking to be in-and-out. When I first came here I was really uncomfortable by the service, but now that I know what to expect it  hasn't deterred me from returning. If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese and to try some different dishes at a very low cost, I highly recommend Pho Thanh."}
{"text":"I called ahead because I have a food allergy and I'm a vegetarian and I was told that they have no way of knowing what is in the food and that I could not speak to a chef. The man was exceedingly rude too. Considering the number of people with food allergies and how considerate most places are, the rude and callous response was incredibly off putting. I will never go here, nor recommend their food."}
{"text":"Disappointment...   They have horrible customer service. Disappointing to see local business just not give two cents about treating customers the right way. The are not helpful, prompt, courteous, pleasant, or accommodating.   If you are willing to basically sacrifice self respect for cheap decent food... sure I guess.   Just ridiculous."}
{"text":"My family love this place ,!! i come all the time when i come downtown pheonix ."}
{"text":"I love the pho here. It is always jammed packed though even during the week. Condiments are always at the table so no need to ask for anything. They'll get you in and out in a hurry. And there is a boba shop connected directly next door."}
{"text":"I had the bun bo hue and it was delicious!!!! I highly recommend it. It had all the veggies to accompany it and it was fresh!  The pho also smelled ready nice. My other family members had it and said it was the right about it seasoning in the broth."}
{"text":"If only I can put a zero rating! The servers/owner don't have any customer service skills! They are so RUDE! I brought my family from out of town along with 20 other people. When we said that the pho is cold after 2 mins of being served, the lady responded with \"you guys talk talk talk\"! We literally just got our order! When we got a small side of soup, the server literally pretty much threw the bowl in the table, causing it to spill!   This place should be closed down just because of their attitude. These people shouldn't work in a customer based environment if they don't even know how to approach people. Oh plus the place is soooooooo DIRTY! Don't dare going to the washroom!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed  the Pho,  spring  rolls and combination  fried rice very much.  Plenty of tables and very casual  dress.  Food flavorful  and very authentic.   The service  can be friendlier, but it is a very busy place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best pho in Phoenix, you can stop your search immediately and go directly to this place.   If you're looking for great friendly service, keep searching.  Pho thanh is notorious for its amazing food and apathetic service.  Your business won't be appreciated, but you will be served quickly and you'll still be happy.   Not sure what to order?? The egg rolls are delicious for an appetizer.  The Thai iced tea or iced offer are superb.  My favorite entree is the pho soup with rice noodles and filet mignon (add vegetables)."}
{"text":"Best pho in town. I dream of this place.  I order the 12 with egg rolls. Come eat here."}
{"text":"I absolutely just love this place. With the added expansion, it has helped tremendously with seating.  The only thing I do find odd is the hostess stand is by the register towards the back of the restaurant. Instead of greeting you at the door, they yell and tell you where to sit. Haha to each their own. My go to is always the number 18 chicken pho gá. Food here is always served very quickly! All the fixings are brought out and silverware and chopsticks are at the table. Condiments are also readily available for you at the table. I highly recommend this place! I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I got terrible food poisoning from here. I'm not surprised either. This place is so dirty and poorly ran. So sad. Save yourself the 24 hours of pain and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Valley. I've been coming here on and off over the last 5 years, and it hasn't improved. The food is mediocre - I love ordering bún with grilled pork and their \"grilled pork\" seems like some sort of ground up meat conglomeration. Thai tea that I've ordered in the restaurant has tasted watered down. The service is the worst part. Not one of the employees looks pleased to be here, and it translates to their treatment of customers. The only thing Pho Thanh has going for it is location and price. If you're ever on the west side of town, please try Pho 43 or Song Lynn. Much better food, value, and service."}
{"text":"This review is for their broken rice and charbroiled pork dish!  Call me a little ignorant or perhaps arrogant, But I wasn't expecting much from a Vietnamese establishment from Arizona.  Coming from Southern California, home of Little Saigon, I thought that I probably would have already tried all the best broken rice dishes that vietnamese cuisine had to offer.  But I was definitely wrong.  That's because up until a few months ago, I haven't yet tried the Pho Thanh version!  I ordered the charbroiled pork broken rice plate, expecting the typical slices of grilled pork meat over rice.  When my dish came out, I was a little taken aback.   Instead of the usual, I found two large pieces of what looked a pork meatloaf/sausage hybrid on top of broken rice. Don't get me wrong, the grilled meat looked pretty tasty but I was certain that someone must have made a mistake with my order.  I didn't want to make a fuss about it, especially since it looked pretty good, so I decided to just keep it and try it out.  Seriously, one of the best decisions of my life.  The charbroiled pork loaf thing here is out of this world!  Super tender, full of flavor and grilled to perfection.  The only way I can describe it, is the vietnamese pork equivalent to dduk kalbi in korean cuisine.  Dduk Kalbi is marinated beef short rib meat that is chopped up and molded together somewhat like a hamburger patty.  Super delicious.  I've been pleasantly surprised with my culinary adventures in Arizona, and Pho Thanh is a place that I'll always remember, and will definitely visit when I go back in the future.  They have forever changed broken rice for me!"}
{"text":"A whole bunch of years ago, a man brought me to Pho Bang on a 'friend date'. It was my first experience with Vietnamese food - and I was hooked! on the food, not on him. Countless visits to Pho Bang, and just as many to the newer, larger, cleaner incarnation - Pho Thanh! While my standby has been an order of spring rolls, a bowl of pho and a cafe sua da (sweetened iced coffee), I've been all over the menu. The bun bowls, the specialty plates, all the appetizers, the banh mi (sandwiches). And I have been happy every visit. I've had men bring me here on first, or at least early dates - as a litmus test for their appreciation of ethnic dives. I've met dear friends here for catch-up on life meals. I've come many times with my former neighbor or my roommate(s) - because when the craving hits, it seems to hit everyone at once. When I start to feel a cold coming on, I think pho is a better medicine than chicken noodle soup!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here,  and I'm sure it won't be the last!  My girl and I enjoyed the atmosphere, and it reminded me of being back overseas."}
{"text":"This hole In the wall will not leave you with a hole in your wall-et & it's super filling! My fave is 122. I crave it all the time! It's clean & the people are genuinely nice it is a bit packed but never a problem, I always get seated with great service!"}
{"text":"Some cuisines are hit and miss for me.  Take Indian food for example.  I've had Indian food that runs the gamut from amazing to awful.  Same goes for Vietnamese cuisine.  I've been to valley Vietnamese staples like Rice Paper & Da Vang, as well as spots outside the Phoenix area with decidedly mixed results.  Which partly explains why I probably avoided Pho Thanh as long as I have.  I just wasn't super confident I'd have a good experience here.  But with an empty fridge on Sunday and Pho Thanh still being bookmarked on my Yelp account forever, I got up the nerve to give Pho Thanh a try for lunch.  Set right on the light rail on the northwest corner of 17th Ave and Camelback, Pho Thanh occupies a surprisingly large space in a small Asian strip center.  The restaurant is pretty humble looking both inside and out, but I was almost immediately taken aback by how large the interior was, with seating for upwards of 200 at a time.  The tables are numbered for reasons I'll explain later and the place was super busy, but fortunately the waitress guided me to one of the few available small tables in the corner (Table 4, for the record).  The menu, as the Yelp reviews and photos have accurately depicted, is vast.  With tons of apps, sides, soups, sandwiches, and house specialities to choose from.  Yet with all the choices available, the very first appetizer menu item immediately caught my eye.  The Goi Cuon is a pair of rice paper spring rolls with all kinds of goodies.  Pork, shrimp, lettuce, cilantro, mint, sprouts, and vermicelli noodles.  Served with a nice light peanut sauce on the side.  Admittedly I'm more of a fried roll kind of guy moreso than rice paper, but the interior of the roll was fabulous.  The mint and cilantro elements really tingle your tongue and give it more depth than just the meat and peanut sauce alone.  As for my entree, I went with one of the house specialities.  The Bo Luc Lac is a relatively simple dish in the grand scheme of things.  Meat, white rice, and salad.  But the meat in this case is cubes of filet mignon that are cooked until they're sizzling hot and the meat comes out to your table still sizzling and bubbling much as you would see a steak fajita tray fresh off the burner.  The sauce on the meat is a mixture of soy and a couple of other elements I couldn't quite put my finger on.  But the jasmine rice soaked up that sauce superbly and the salad served as a lovely palate cleanser.  Really solid lunch.  Two other aspects that stand out about Pho Thanh are the remarkable efficiency of their staff and of course the prices.  From the moment I stepped in the door, the staff were incredibly quick to get me seated, get me a water, take my order, and brought out both my app and entree in rapid fire succession.  This despite well over 100 other patrons in the restaurant for lunch.  Back to that table numbering thing.  At the end of your meal, they don't bring your check out to you.  Instead you walk up to the register, tell them your table number and pay there on the spot.  As for the prices, yeah they're cheap.  Accessible to virtually anyone of any income level.  I got one of the more expensive entrees at $11, but the overwhelming plurality of the menu is less than $10, with many being less than $5.   Total cost for my app and entree plus tax and tip came to $18.  A great meal with great flavors, great staff, in a humble (but spacious) neighborhood friendly spot.  I'll be back for some Pho and perhaps a Banh Mi sandwich before long.  Vietnamese food remains hit or miss for me, but this CenPho Vietnamese restaurant definitely nails it."}
{"text":"Wonderful vegetarian options. Came in with a coworker and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Very authentic and very good Vietnamese food. Great value for the money and clearly a favorite with the local Vietnamese.  The spring rolls were very tasty and came with a terrific peanut sauce.  They also provide many other typical condiments on the table to spice up your dish.  I had the slice beef Pho and it was delicious!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"A little Viet Namiese action tonight, meaning a HUGE bowl of soup, loaded with noodles, shrimp, fish, veggies and broth...SENSATIONAL.  There has to be a good human interest story behind this restaurant. It appears a family from SE Asia has emigrated to the U.S. They cook, clean, serve, and manage EVERYTHING. They are HARD WORKING, trustworthy and motivated.  The results of these efforts show in the BUSY and LARGE crowd of customers.  It's FUN to see and ENJOY."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and the shrimp spring rolls are great.  The bathroom on the other hand is always dirty and nasty. There is always pee on the floor in the bathroom and it smells bad in there.  Food #1.    Bathroom save it for home."}
{"text":"Dee-lishis!!  Very good pho and very cheap.  Although cheap it is still good quality food.  Some things could be better portioned such as the egg rolls, but sooo tasty.  Establishment is fairly clean and service is....well i get food brought to me...thats about it.  But all in all...not too shabby! :)"}
{"text":"Came here after church and the restaurant is very busy, but it wasn't a long wait for us to get our food, we order beef noodle and the seafood soup, it is very good and it's a great price. Got to say this is one of my favorite place to eat Vietnamese food. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good soup."}
{"text":"Good food not the greatest service but it's doable if you want some nice pho......  I don't have a lot to say but for some damn reason yelp keep making me write so I will just write nonsense bcuz the food is okay damn no details just okay   Yelp damn why must I write a book about mediocre food  this is crazy"}
{"text":"Com chien ca man and house special pho are two of my favorite things in this place. Parking can be frustrated at times, and sometimes I have to fight for it, but it's all worth because of the food. This place may look normal from outside, but once I get inside I can see that the place is organized nicely. There are always customers, come and go constanstly. Food come out fast and service is prompt. Plus, I can get an easy access to next door where I can buy steam buns."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese in Phoenix.  The Pho Ga and the Lemongrass chicken are very good.  Spring rolls are fresh and have more shrimp and pork than rice noodles.  Pho Tai was just good.  On top of everything else, it is clean and the wait staff is very nice.  Great Vietnamese coffee....just like in Vietnam."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for good pho ever since I moved to Phoenix.  I'm originally from Denver, but lived in LA for a year, so I've had some goooood pho.  I've tried a couple of different places since I've been here, but really didn't enjoy any of them...  And then I discovered Pho Thanh.  It looka a little sketchy and uninviting from the outside and parking was a little difficult (pro-tip: we actually discovered a huge parking lot in the back.  There are some signs that say additional parking is available in the back, but they're not entirely visible!), but this place is great.  I came here with a coworker for lunch and it was SO BUSY and PACKED.  There's nothing special about the interior.  It's plain and simple, but this place is HUGE.  Yet despite how crowded this place was, the staff was able to quickly seat us, take our order, and deliver our food.  And oh my god.  Their pho was absolutely delicious!  The broth was fresh and flavorful, the portion was generous, they had a ton of condiments on their table, the vegetables were fresh, and everything was reasonably priced! It tasted like home!   Also, their menu is HUGE.  If you don't like pho, but you like authentic Vietnamese food, this place has it all!  My coworker isn't too big on Yelp, but said to me, \"this place is amazing! you better give them five stars!\" I couldn't agree more.  Fantastic service, fantastic food. I'm definitely going to become a regular here."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for awhile now but I'm not a huge fan of any Vietnamese I have ever tried. I went for it after all the good buzz about this place.  I ordered the spring rolls (fried) delish! and a Pho with meatball. I decided to order it to go but should have ate in. The soup is delish love all the condiments u add in..made mine super spicy. Had a iced Thai tea. very sweet and yummy but prob opt for the coffee next time. They sell coconuts for $2!!! i am so getting one next time. I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"So I am not sure where to start about this place. Have eaten here once but had a bad experience twice.  There was one night a month ago where I yelped for a pho restaurant near me and came across this place. We were 17 minutes away so we drove over and it was closed with no sign or excuse.  It was a normal business night an hour and half before closing.  I was happy they were closed cause I went to the next place we found on Yelp. DA VANG which is maybe 3 minutes away. We loved Da Vang as the food was so good and authentic as well as cheap. It was a blessing.  I had picked this place only cause it had more reviews. Many which I found said go to Da Vang.  We have gone to their competitor 5 times at least and went on Wednesday when they were closed by accident. Yelp does have them as closed. So, we tried here.  This is bigger and probably a similar menu...it's pho and Vietnamese after all.  I ordered the crispy spring rolls and hubby the summer rolls with pork and shrimp. Neither were great. My crispy ones were soggy and they gave me one piece of lettuce for the 2 rolls. I had regular pho Tai and the meat was rubbery. The noodles were clumped together and they gave such little bean sprouts. My hubby had the phone with filet and I watched him spit out all the fatty meat pieces into his napkin.  No one spoke to us and I don't think they really speak English. We had to walk up to get the check. We won't come back even on Wednesdays when da Vang is closed."}
{"text":"Family restaurant of Da Vang and Thuan Thanh. This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants and the other would be their family-owned restaurants. Lol to those who think there is a competition to Da Vang or Pho Thanh, the owners are siblings. It is not too pricey. I love their Filet Pho. The meat is very juicy and thicker than usual side beef. The only thing about the place that stops me from going here to eat is that they close seasonly during Lunar New Year for roughly a month. I understand that Lunar New Year is a very important celebration and people celebrate it for at least 2 weeks to a month. Thus, I give them an excuse to close since I don't think they close on other short 1-day holidays.  I usually don't order rice here because their fish sauce isn't good. It is too sour. I have to add more sugars but it still doesn't taste as good."}
{"text":"Their young coconut is a must! There were five of us, and they originally told us to sit with another two customers which I said \"no\". The food was fast, and delicious. I highly recommend this if you crave for Pho."}
{"text":"We went out of our way to eat here on the way the phx airport. Delicious!  The crepe appetizer was fresh and not greasy.  The eggrolls were crispy and the pho was huge.  Definitely satisfies any craving.  Service is slow but prices are cheap and the food is good so I can't complain much."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho. Atmosphere was nice reminded me of home. (CA)  If you are looking to get some Pho on a sunday morning after a night of drinking I would recommend this place. But if you are like most yelpers who seem to be looking for a 5 star wine and dine place I suggest you go elsewhere. This place is cool tho."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef on a sizzling plate but the portion is too small. The pho is ok. The broth lacks flavor but the proportion is good."}
{"text":"Everyone in the area knows Pho Thanh has the delectable real pure homemade from your grandmas kitchen pho! Though there are other great pho restaurants, we don't hesitate in our decision to driving farther just to come here."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews this place has been getting, I had to try it out.  This is a small place in a strip mall.  Again, not \"D&G cool\" but \"local cool.\"  The place had a good amount of people, even at around 4 pm.   Although I like pho, I prefer bun bo hue.  So, that is what I ordered.  It was okay.  The broth was a bit watery, lacking in depth of flavor.  But I did get a generous amount of meat, as well herbs an such, as accompaniments, which is always a plus.     My husband had the pho, however.  He ordered the extra large size for a few dollars more.  Although you get more noodles and broth with the extra large size, you do not get more meat.  So, he was a little disappointed.  But, the broth was very flavorful.  More flavorful than the bun bo hue broth.   And he also got a good amount of herbs and such to go with his pho.  If you are in the neighborhood and have a hankering for pho, I would say this is the place to go.  But, as a Tempe resident, I would stick with Kai Hoan for pho or bun bo hue."}
{"text":"I definitely need to eat Vietnamese food more often.  I just got back from Pho Thanh and I am in  Pho afterglow.  My date and I ordered two bowls of Pho,  a shrimp dish, a Thai tea, and a real coconut to drink from, all for the bargain price of (get this) seventeen dollars.  Not kidding!!!  The prices are so inexpensive.  The food is comfort food like no other.  Damn it was good.  The location is not the greatest but I will risk it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Yummy and great service. Hands down a fan"}
{"text":"1st visit here (after a stop at Zia records first): great food, price,and service. We ordered enough to have leftovers since we were staying a distance from this place. We got: lemongrass chicken, lemongrass beef, a BBQ pork sandwich, lemongrass beef vermicelli bowl, and fried rolls. Everything was great and good value for the price. I would try a different sandwich next time, it wasn't my thing - some kind of strange pâté included. All this food for under $30, we had food for three meals x two hungry people."}
{"text":"I came here got the shrimp spring rolls and so good as always. it was pretty busy as always. the employees were nice. the bathroom was sorta dirty a little and they should kinda fix that  I will come back tho bc my friend Susan loves the beef pho here and i always get the shrimp pho. very good  don't judge guys dang"}
{"text":"This is the best place I have found around the valley for Vietnamese food especially Bunbohue. The spring rolls are great, phodacbiet is great. Service is hit and miss but totally bearable. There is a light rail stop not far from this place which is awesome, great place to stop and fill up. I would eat here everyday given the chance."}
{"text":"It's okay, there are places with better tasting Vietnamese food nearby but when I get an itch for Vietnamese on a Monday when my go to is closed, I come here :) service is like a 2/5 stars though."}
{"text":"Having moved office to the Central Ave Corridor vicinity, I've been checking out some new restaurants in the area. I was delighted to know that 43rd Express, my previous favourite Phoenix Vietnamese place, was just a few miles down the road. However, a workmate told me about Pho Thanh and took me there for a meal. And it's now become my favourite V diner.  I'd read a number of reviews on Yelp indicating that this place is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems, and to tell the truth it's not much to look at from the outside, just a dodgy door and blacked out windows in a nondescript brick building. But you kinda get a bit of a shock when you walk in, because it's WAY bigger on the inside than you'd have guessed standing in the carpark. Seedyish, and very popular. I saw all sorts of people inside, not just Asians. That's always a good sign. Sat down and got my usual - pho dac biet, xe lua. Delivered quick and piping hot. Gigantic bowl. Tasted fantastic, although pretty light on the tendon chunks, which are my absolute favourite bits in the soup. I also got a fresh coconut and had a joyous time draining it then scraping out the soft flesh with a long-handled spoon, feeling at times like a monkey with a damn cookie jar.   They accept credit cards, which is awesome - 43rd Express does not, and since Pho Thanh essentially serves more pho in their bowl with the same quality I don't think I'll be returning to 43rd anytime soon; I'm also not keen on having to use an ATM first every time I want to eat there. Get a credit card processing system in place, sheesh.  Four stars. Lots of room inside, busy at lunchtime, good amount of chow, great taste, other Yelpers really like it (we're a discerning bunch, right?) and not too far from work. Oh, and the credit card thing. I don't mind the fact that they've got these long tables where you could potentially be elbow-to-elbow with a stranger, either. Just an overall decent place to fill up at, with or without a crowd of workmates."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. While the Pho soup was OK, the Pho from Pho Chau in Rochester, MN has it beat! I did not enjoy the egg rolls at all; they were greasy and too peppery. The worst part about the entire visit, though, was the service. There is a \"please wait to be seated\" sign as you enter the door, but no one greets you. Instead, one of the servers yells across the room and points to a numbered table where you are to go sit. I wanted a Go container for the remainder of my soup. When I asked the server for one, he pointed to a table along the wall, and told me to go it for myself. I've never, ever been expected to get my own \"go\" box! I won't go back here. The only thing I was impressed with was the reasonable price for the soup."}
{"text":"It was a Monday and all of the regular chinese haunts were closed. I decided that I would give the old Pho Bang one last try. Much to my delight I realized a change in the name. My hopes began to rise.   To begin the prices were VERY reasonable (about five dollars a plate, six if you want the everything plate). The patrons were primarily (but not exclusively) Vietnamese families.   My wife enjoyed her tofu and vegetable stir fry. I had a delicious pork plate. We encountered a language barrier with the server that was quickly overcome by pointing to our choice on the menu. The staff was very friendly. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Not the nicest but probably the best in Phoenix.   Service is also pretty poor.  Despite all that, this place is packed almost every night!  And I know why... just so so good!  Get the Beef Stew.  Not what you think.  Absolutely the best broth on the menu... and VERY filling (hardy)!   You will likely thank me!"}
{"text":"Went to try out their pho but was ignored when I walked in.. a couple came in after me a few min later and were attended right away. The server/host saw me waiting but made no attempts to provide me a menu or even ask if I was already attended...  Recommend to not go alone or you will be ignored."}
{"text":"All the other reviews are spot on - horrendous (lack of) customer service.  I'll try to make this an actual review and not a rant!  I'm Asian myself and I know what is authentic Chinese and Vietnamese customer service in authentic Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants (unfortunately, lol) and the staff here is beyond bad service.  I typically try to be positive in reviews, still being factual, but this place made my blood boil!  Msg me seperately if you want to know what I experienced!  *** Rude staff aside, I walked in here immediately feeling convinced that the food is going to be oh so good based on how it looked like on the inside; a typical layout of a Vietnamese restaurant: floral portraits, tacky coloured walls, dark brown furniture, wooden tri-fold wall separator, with Vietnamese music playing.  Ordered an iced coffee and the number 12 pho (beef and tripes) off the menu.  I was let down that the ice coffee arrived in a plastic Dixie cup .... with a cover ... and a straw.... There was no longing for the last coffee drip to be had.  And now the pho arrives.  I ordered a small, oh, boy was it a small bowl! lol It had green onions as part of the toppings - that's a first.  Tried the broth without adding any condiments (you have to!) and the broth was delicious!  It tastes real beefy if that makes any sense.  I guess it means it's very flavourful!  For the size of the bowl, it had the right amount of meat.  There were a lot of noodles, and the noodles seem to have sat in water for too long so it it was \"fluffy\".  Overall, the broth has won me over.  I came here wanting to see what other pho in the West Island has to offer and the end result: I will continue going to the competitor who's closer to me and who are friendly.  Really up to you on how you choose to eat your pho - this place is cheap ($8 small bowl) with very good broth; I recommend no green onions tho'. You just have to suck it up and ignore how unpleasant the staff is.  As for me, I am loyal to another place and cheating on them for this one time has left me in guilt. :p  BTW, just had my first sip of their iced coffee, and, ...meh.... :/."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Pho worth the drive !:) always my #1 to go for soup. Great food. Great service ,"}
{"text":"I thought I had enough pho in lots of other Vietnamese restaurants, so I tried the catfish in clay pot and sautéed shrimp with rice. My mistake, stir fried dishes are not well-known in Vietnamese restaurants. They look worse than what I cook at home, very salty! Never again."}
{"text":"Yet again I'll say it... This is THE Vietnamese restaurant for me in Phoenix! The food and the prices are still amazing. You can leave completely stuffed for under $10 every single time you eat here, and you don't have to order the same thing every time! There are plenty of well-priced dishes on the menu.   The thing on my mind that has to be mentioned though is their expansion. They have doubled the size of their dining room, and I couldn't be happier! Now Pho Thanh has plenty of space for all of its patrons to enjoy a hot bowl of the best beef pho in the valley!   If you still haven't gone here, change that immediately."}
{"text":"The resturant was located in the ghetto. Cheap, fast, and easy. Perfect hangover food!"}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying I love.. LOVE PHO! I have tried mostly every pho place in the valley and this place tops all of them, it's a little hole in the wall place that cooks amazing food. The service is ehh, I don't go to pho places looking for good customer service though, if you want good food come here. :)"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend! Pretty comparable to most Pho places in Chinatown or CDN. Had the Pho with rare beef, tendon, and flank, and it was pretty good! The broth was really tasty, but the noodles lacked a bit of flavour. There are lots of condiment choices, though (hoisin sauce, chili flakes, chili sauce, Sriracha, and soy sauce), as well as the usual toppings (lime, bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, and hot peppers).  Prices are par for the course with other pho places ($8-$10 tax in per depending on size), and the bowl portions are pretty standard as well (although the bowls look smaller than they actually are). Their menu also had the standard options available at any pho place (including the rice dishes and 3-color drink dessert).  The outside of the restaurant is pretty non-descript, but the interior looks cleaner and more modern than your average pho restaurant. The lighting is nice, and the smooth music playing in the background was a nice touch.  Other reviews pointed out the lack of customer service, but the waitress was pretty friendly in my experience. She just sounded a bit curt at times, and I found it odd that she asked us if we were ready to order twice within the first couple minutes.  Overall, great restaurant. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Our favorite pho spot was closed so we decided to visit Pho Thanh for a nice bowl of soup.....what we got was nothing close to good. They sat us at large table with another family, which was totally fine but it was akward, not going to lie. It's almost like cafeteria seating. We ordered our food and within at least 3 minutes everything was at the table, which means nothing was really made fresh.   1) Let's start with the spring rolls, they were good, obviously pre-made (you can tell by the wrapper) - the dipping sauce was liquid and had ZERO taste to it. I don't recommend the sauce but I do the roll.  2) The beef with broccoli was disgusting, the meat was thin and white/gray in color. Shrived up little pieces of meat.  3) ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Felt like cattle, move them in, move them out.   4) Pho was awful. So much oil in the broth. Meat was over cooked. Not good. Lips felt really oily.   If you're looking for Pho, check out Da Vang which is less than a mile away."}
{"text":"Among the best Vietnamese cuisine experienced, and at rock bottom prices. Great pho, along with a stir fry noodle dish with a variety of vegetables. But don't order anything with shrimp. Let's just say it was fishy. And take extra care in the neighborhood, it's not safe."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers for great reviews and Pho Thanh for providing an awesome Pho dinner. Good flavor, good price!! Well worth the drive from Goodyear!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get pho, we come quite often and they've expanded a lot over the last several years. The only slight downside is how busy it is, you sometimes have to share a table with another group but it's never been awkward and you normally don't have to wait. The other slight downside is they normally close for a month for Chinese New Year and we anxiously wait until they are open again. The other thing to know is when you walk in just lift up how many fingers are in your party and they will point you to a table, they don't actually come and seat you. We always get the spring rolls and they have awesome peanut sauce! We also love the pho with sliced beef and sometimes add shrimp. I love that they don't put on veggies for the kids pho and I don't have to remember to ask them not to. I've tried some of their other dishes- salads and rice dishes and they have all been consistently good. Reasonably priced. My family is addicted."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was really good. This was my first time going there and was very impressed by both the service and the quality of the food. I ordered spring rolls and pho. That was too much food for one person. I was glad to have arrived before the lunch rush because there was a huge line by the time I was done and ready to pay. The crowds were very mixed and that can only speak of the great food served here. I can't wait to bring my mom here!"}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count on my hands and feet combined.... But I don't know why I've never written a review! I saw my cousins and thought that I was totally slacking so here we go!  This place is a bit sketch at night, and not my favorite to come alone to be honest. But I will saw that I've had really good and authentic dishes here. The pho ga, tamarind soup, and the crab soup that I cannot spell to save my life are great. The tamarind soup comes with rice on the side to spoon in, and is one of my favorite things ever. The sugar cane shrimp is tasty as well. Bun xeo wasn't bad here but I like Com Tam in Mekong Plaza better for that.  The drinks here are pretty good, I've had quite a few... I don't know if my sodium levels are messed up, but I definitely like salted plum soda!   I know the location is meh... But it's not supposed to be like Dominicks!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pho places here in Arizona. I'm usually a home cooked meal kind of girl but this place never disappoints. The environment is nice and good customer service. Unfortunately, being located in the middle of Phoenix it looks like a hole in a wall kind of place. But when coming in this restaurant it's complete opposite! This place has changed so much over the years. It used to be a very old dirty small restaurant with no AC. But they definitely made some major renovations and expanded the store. Milk Run Boba next door is a nice addition to the plaza. The two stores is literally connected with one door. Definitely attracts people to go to both places.  I usually order the Pho Dac Biet which is $7.45 And I just had Goi Cuon (Spring Rolls) which is $2.50. The prices are very affordable. The noodles are very soft and the broth is so good. And the spring rolls is perfectly wrapped and has a good texture. Definitely recommend people to come here!   *Note the picture is Pho Dac Biet without meat. I had to take a picture of hers since I ate my food already No meat because she's vegetarian! But still very good!"}
{"text":"This place is always PACKED. lunch and dinner, every day of the week. So we thought we needed to see what the attraction was? We went in for lunch. The place is nothing fancy and in all honesty it could use some ambiance.  At that point we figured it was safe was to assume that it was the food bringing people in. The spring rolls for an appetizer were awesome, wrapped in a sticky rice paper w lots of flavor. The entree was so so. It did have good flavor although it was rather small."}
{"text":"I love this place and the prices are great ; ) the soup are the best ; ) and never had mess up order love it"}
{"text":"Ahh geez, how have I not checked into this place before now?? Pho Thanh is in my neighborhood and I've driven past this little restaurant on the north west corner of 17th Ave. and Camelback so many times. My regular Pho place was closed on Wednesdays, so I decided to give them a try. It doesn't always look the most inviting on the outside. And parking is tight. It was a nice surprise to see how big they are on the inside. Seeing a lot of Thai/Vietnamese people in a Pho restaurant is always a good sign. Like you got the low-down on some inside secret. Anyway, I ordered Chicken Pho $7.25 . Lots of chicken, rice noodles, basil, lime wedges, cilantro, bean sprouts, sliced jalapeño rounds. 2 sauces. I also ordered a couple of their rice paper pork and shrimp rolls $2.50 each. Clean and neat, to go order was ready in 15 minutes. I got a Thai tea to go from their Milk Bar. My roommate went back the next day to pick us up more Pho.   Chicken Pho cures whatever ails you."}
{"text":"****3.5 STARS****  We came to AZ to help my sister settle in her new condo. My Dad only eats Vietnamese food whenever we go out. We try to expand his palette but he hates everything else lol.  What We Got - Bun Bo Hue - Pho Ga - Bun Thit Nuong - Com Tam Thit Nuong Bi Cha  My sister and I LOVED their Bun Bo Hue!! It's different than what I'm used too.. they add cha and a lot of dried garlic flakes in it. The only down sides were that they skimped on the noodles (I love noodles and I can't just eat meat by itself), it was pretty oily, and that the some of the beef were chewy because it was super fatty. :( I liked how they had the spicy sauce on the side for the Bun Bo Hue!!  My Mom, Dad, and sister's boyfriend weren't as thrilled about their dishes. They just thought it was okay. It wasn't bad nor amazing. It's definitely a good alternative if I'm in AZ. I will be back when I visit my sister!  The place could be cleaner. The restroom was not up to par. There was a guy who kept asking for money outside. :T"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE?!?!?  YESSSSS!!!  Not only do I love it because it is blocks from my house...  but the food it GREAT for the price.  Good stuff here.  I know a LOT of Pho snobs and so I dont' know what they'd rate it but...  I am BIG on service, value and flavor...  Pho Thanh came with it ALL.  I had the Spring Rolls and the Combination Pho and with tip, paid about 11 dollars.  I need to eat here more...  =)   My only complaint...  well WISH I should say...  is that I WISH they were open later.  =/"}
{"text":"Probably going to be my go 2 place to get some Pho. Came here with the fam and they all liked the food!! Service was pretty busy but was worth the wait...."}
{"text":"I went to this place on my lunch at about 11:00. I sat down and ordered  had my food in less than 5 minutes. The the pho was delicious and super cheap! I got a bowl of beef pho for 4.50! I could not have been happier with the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Good pho, yummy shrimp & pork Spring rolls BUT the peanut sauce has an odd texture. Kind of slimy and separated. Not sure if that's normal, every other place I've tried had much creamier peanut sauce."}
{"text":"#26, #1, #150 is my favorite. I go here every time I need something warm in my belly. They are open early too!  I love this place and the dining area has gotten bigger :)  Had the Bun bo hue. Was pretty good and cheap!"}
{"text":"My best friend brought me here on a lunch date and every since that day, I am hooked. They have some of the best, if not the best, pho in Phoenix. I never leave hungry and I'm always looking forward to the next trip here. Their chicken pho is my favorite but their pork bahn mi sandwiches are amazing!   Definitely recommend, but beware, the secret is out so expect a crowd! Don't forget to grab their spring rolls, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place! Cheap pho and it comes in huge bowls! The decor is a little strange but after your first bite you forget about it. Awesome good for an awesome price. Five stars."}
{"text":"Good place if you're in the mood for Vietnamese food.  Get the coconut juice - the real one."}
{"text":"EAT A BUG!!!  Ordered the pho tan beef soup and the lettuces/mint sprigs that come with it had big dead bugs on them -- don't they even wash their produce?  Now I wonder how many bugs are in everything else they serve?  Service was non-existent, no eye contact either.  Very busy, but I don't know why.  Workers running around like chickens with their heads cut off - maybe they have more business than they can handle well.  IOW, they don't have time to clean the place or wash their produce.  Eggrolls super greasy - ick!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  We go here whenever we can and the Pho is amazing!  If you're in the area... Stop by and try the number 11!!!  Great prices and big portions."}
{"text":"This is my absolutely my favorite Vietnamese place in Phoenix.  I usually rotate between ordering the following 3 entrees:  -Pho Dac Biet: Beef Broth noodle soup that comes with sliced beef, tendon, beef brisket and meatballs.  -Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong: Cold rice noodle dish served with grilled pork and 2 egg rolls -Com Tam Thanh Dac Biet: It's broken rice that  comes with a grilled pork chop, fried egg, crab-egg cake ground shrimp wrapped in beancurd and beef wrapped in grape leaves. This dish is pretty big. It can probably serve two, but I don't like sharing it.   All portions are generous and the flavors are intense.  Food comes out pretty fast considering they can get really busy. If you're looking for service and ambiance, you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for fast, quality food that's cheap then this is the place for you.  One note, we found out the hard way, they are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I don't absolutely love it, but I definitely don't hate it. I find their broth a little watered down and bland. Their bowls also don't provide enough meat to compensate for the amount of noodles they give.  Overall, I wouldn't not eat here again, it simply wouldn't be my first option. Staff was very friendly and price was average. Big restaurant and there's never a wait."}
{"text":"I'll be honest.  This place may look like a total hole in the wall from the outside and is not much to look at on the inside.  Guess what, that doesn't matter in the slightest.  Not only is the Pho the best Pho I've had in Arizona (can't say best ever, as I've had some great Pho in the Bay Area), but the prices here are incredibly, incredibly reasonable."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I was able to find time to eat at this restaurant again.  The food is delicious and fits everyone's budget.  The employees are nice, the restaurant is clean (however I didn't go to the bathroom) and the food is delicious!!!  This time I ordered the following: Bun Rieu ($6.45): This delicious bowl had crab, sliced pork, pork blood and tomatoes.  Tons of delicious rice noodles with lots of toppings.  I love eating the tomatoes, it's so juicy when you bite into it.   Bi Cuon ($2.50): Spring rolls with shredded pork and pork skin, vermicelli, lettuce, cilantro, mint and sprouts.  I love dipping this refreshing roll in the fish sauce.   This is on my must eat when I'm in Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"My go to pho spot in Phoenix. After living in LA for the last four years I had a lot of good Vietnamese food right in my neighborhood. This place goes head to head with some of my favorite spots in CA. Always fast, authentic and delicious. This is a once a week spot me and my boyfriend frequent when we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"More than just Pho`  You sit at long almost communal tables with just a small gap separating you from your neighbor.  Prices are low but the portion sizes match that so order a few things.  There is a great Veggie selection, spring rolls noodle dishes even a pho like soup.  The service is fast.  The food it self is quite good, both the noodle dish and the veggie pho I had were great was was the veggie spring roll.  Parking is tight up front but there are more spots in back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Pho at a phenomenal price.   I visited Pho Thanh on my lunch break with my niece. We went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. I felt almost like a cheater, as I always go to Da Vang right across the street, but boy was it worth it.  We ordered two orders each of the spring rolls and of the egg rolls, and we each got a bowl of chicken pho. The items came out in a timely manner, and were served with the correct companions (fresh sprouts, fish sauce, herbs, etc.) The spring rolls and egg rolls were cooked to perfection, and the pho was amazing. It was not too oily, like some other places can make it to be, and it had a good ratio of noodles and broth. My only complaint would be that there wasn't a lot of chicken in it, but it could have just been my individual bowl. Service was attentive, but nothing over my expectations (very similar to that of Da Vang, they take your order, bring you your food, and fill your water, that's about it).   The best part was that our entire meal was only $23. For two people both with their own appetizers and pho, I think that is a slammin' deal if you ask me.. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food is so good. Had the spring rolls and the pho beef. Service isn't great but definitely going back just for the food. I am addicted to pho now. Definitely best place in Phoenix for pho!"}
{"text":"Came before & LOVED the Pho, but upon return the Pho was lacking in flavor, the service was beyond horrible and if you have to go to the bathroom...you are better off taking your chances at a gas station rather the use the bathroom here. VERY disappointed & will not return."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The ingredients are fresh, the pho is piping hot and their Thai tea is fantastic. Highly recommend the beef and brisket pho."}
{"text":"This girl had only ever had \"modern\" (read: unauthentic) pho. I was excited when Kevin H. & Marian H. suggested we go get pho- and I knew that they were talking about the real stuff.   I had the delicious meatball pho, and I went back a few days later and had it again. Phenomenal.   Service is a bit lacking (hint to the servers: keep the water coming) but for the actual food, and value- I wouldn't skip this place."}
{"text":"Reminds me of home. (SF)  Efficient, unfriendly service, great food, low prices. Pho Gha with heaps of fresh sides priced at 6.50 or something and a banh mi ($3) and some spring rolls for my fat hunny.  Totally packed on a Saturday afternoon- expansive menu, vietnamese ice coffee served properly.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very conflicted with this review.... though, I realllllly want to give it 2 stars, my counterpart has made me a big ole softy.  We came here on a Wednesday night around 6pm - it was pretty busy already but there were about 10 empty tables. There was a \"Please wait to be seated\" sign near the door. We stood there with our eyes wandering around the place trying to lock eyes with a server, host, busboy... somebody, anybody that worked there. So, after what felt like an eternity, a girl came with two glasses pointed and told us to sit down. After sitting down, our eyes was on another hunt for someone to come to acknowledge us and take our orders. Once the order was placed, the food came quickly but was never checked on again. To pay, you go up to the cashier and guess what? There was a wait there as well!  I had the bun bo hue and the boyfriend had the bun thit nuong cha gio (vermicelli with charbroiled pork and egg roll - do you guys see a pattern with the boyfriend? you have you check out the other Vietnamese restaurants to get this). I ordered extra huyet (blood cubes) which I got unfortunately, the blood cubes had a denser consistency than I preferred but overall, the dish was tasty. He said his dish was tasty too.   Long story short, I don't like to be ignored and I don't like to wait. If you're like me, this is probably not the place for you.   Oh yeah, the prices here are slightly higher than Da Vang.  Da Vang was the first Vietnamese sit-down place I've been to out here and I still like it there. It's kinda like a first love but in a form of a Vietnamese restaurant. lol"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in town. Clean, speedy and fresh. Admittedly, I haven't ventured too far off the pho portion of the menu but they have a great selection of filet, brisket, meatballs and tripe. Great place for a speedy lunch."}
{"text":"This place is authentic Vietnamese food!  Always fresh and yummy.  I usually get #12 sliced beef with noodles.  I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Best in Phoenix  And sooooo cheap you won't believe it Food is always excellent  Place is crowded as it should be"}
{"text":"Shut the Pho up this Chicken Soup is so darn good. I been dining here for many years but failed to write a review. This traditional Vietnamese restaurant is my favorite Pho spot.  The taste is consistent and always flavorful. I have tried other options on the menu however I am hooked on their Pho. For the price point you can leave full.   This place is the real deal. It's a whole in the wall that caters to large groups or family who want the real deal.  The service is nothing spectacular but it is more of a sit down, order and eat at fast pace. Not a date night place or fancy girls night out. Just a real meal with a home flavorful appeal.   If you want to try something different to drink check out the drink menu. The coffee will keep you up all night long, or drink from a Coconut, maybe some real Chi tea or settle on a can of soda."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant ever. I have eaten Pho in Phoenix, San Francisco, Orange County, Seattle, Portland, and Denver. I have never, ever tasted anything quite like Pho Thahn. There's something quite magical about the food here. (I have a friend who swears it's chicken feet added to the soup for extra flavoring.)  But yes! Yes yes yes! They are closed this week for a holiday, and this post is the only way I can satisfy my soup craving. (Writing about soup while thinking about soup, in all its glory.)  Ask for: An extra large pho ga with one order of spring rolls and a large Vietnamese drip coffee."}
{"text":"Limited choice on Vietnamese fare. Different types of pho, vermicelli and rice plates. No kids menu. Pho is very good but other fares are bland. Pho had decent amount of meat and the broth is delicious. I will only come here for pho. Nothing else."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place! She eats here practically everyday! The spring rolls are delicious and very reasonably priced as is the pho. My wife enjoys the chicken pho while l prefer the fillet mignon pho with added vegetables. Worth the drive and wait. Very casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Have good dry vermicelli bowls. I guess they could add more flavors to make it taste better. The pork and beef vermicelli bowls are best. Just try to make it more flavorful."}
{"text":"I have written a review for this place before.  Just want to add that my favorite dish there is \"Banh Mi Bo Kho\" - which is beef stew with bread. The beef are very well cook and very juicy and the bread are soft, a great combo together! I would recommend this dish out of all the dishes they have there."}
{"text":"Have to first state that I am not a huge fan of pho in general but largely due in part to my seafood and shellfish allergy and having had some previous reactions to fish & oyster sauces used by some spots. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Had a meet n greet with a potential business client and he chose the place and rather than disagree or seem picky, I agreed thinking I would just pick at some food. I had the beef and meatball pho and requested the removal of any and all traces of seafood, including any potential cross contaminants. She was nice about it and friendly and assured me it would not include anything other than meat, broth and noodles and any of the various vegetables I included myself. Order came out and was fresh, not greasy and no seafood.   What was far more impressive was the diverse group of patrons it had for a lunch crowd! Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, you name it, they were present and enjoying the food. Great to see Asian foods being appreciated by so many! Service is prompt and friendly and fairly clean and didn't wreak of jasmine bamboo or fish sauce that often can be found at vietnamese and Thai joints.  Will be back if/when im back in AZ and in the area."}
{"text":"2.5  The above score is only for the pho itself. Went back after all this time & the service was awful this time around. They first wanted to seat us at a dirty table until I protested but then I guess I threw off their little seating system because we didn't get our order taken until after some people who were seated after us even though we were ready to order before them. Then we only had 1 soup spoon left at our table & it was dirty. When I asked for clean spoons, I was ignored so I took clean spoons from an unused table myself. You now do not get your bill at your table (or at least we didn't this time) and just go up & pay. My mom said the ladies bathroom did not have toilet paper in the stalls or anything to dry your hands with so she was grateful she took extra napkins with her. The pho itself is still good but we will not be returning. Too far for such bad service & they now have panhandlers standing in front of the restaurant bothering you."}
{"text":"4.5 because the food is so good. Lacking a half star because the service isn't that great (but you don't go for that) and I've noticed the lemongrass chicken can vary in size between visits. The chicken pho is always top notch. I ask for shrimp spring rolls without the pork and I always get what I want with no issues.  Here's a little guide to Pho Thanh: - There's also parking in the back. - You can seat yourself or wait until you catch the eye of someone working there and they'll air traffic controller style point/wave you to a table. - There are always people eating who work there. Don't be surprised if one of them gets up to take your order before going back to their meal. - Don't expect staff to stand around and chit chat with you. It's probably not going to happen. They act like they're there to feed you and clean up after you and that's it. I should have warned my grandmother and mother to not expect the warm fuzzies when we came here for a family dinner. - Feel free to ask questions or ask for something you need. They are helpful. - DO NOT play with the chopsticks. Seriously. Don't. Would you go somewhere else and play with the silverware? If the answer is yes you need to go back to the cave you came from and learn some manners. The exception to this is if you're in Denny's at 3am. We know you aren't sober. Just don't do anything to get arrested. But really, the table is not your imaginary drum set. You are not a walrus. If you want to play \"swords\" with chopsticks I can help you with that and stab you with one. Parents, please teach your children respect for other cultures, even if this isn't fine dining. - Take food home with you. By the counter there's a rack with containers. Grab what you need. Yes, I know it's customary to eat the noodles right away, but whatever. I'd rather people stop wasting food. It tastes just as good when you're hungry again in a few hours. Their pho is huge. Don't stuff yourself. Get two meals by taking half home. - You pay at the counter. Tell them your table number. If you decide to move tables just make sure you're paying the right ticket. - Never been in an Asian market? There's one right next door. Go get some Pocky. It's only a dollar."}
{"text":"I got here shortly before they were closing. The food was delicious, and very nicely priced. Our server was a very friendly and talkative man, charming ^_^ my Thai iced tea was good. We ordered the beef & broccoli, lemon grass chicken, and pork tendon. There was a sauce I thought was sesame oil and put on my rice, but it wasn't! It was some foul smelling butt sauce! I asked the charming server man what it was he said it was fish sauce? *Beware* aquired taste required. Atmosphere was a little lacking.   So to summarize, food quality 5*, price 5* atmosphere 3*, service 5*  Ill be back ^__^ (stay away from butt sauce)"}
{"text":"Gave up on this place.  A man can only take enough of supporting a place with his hard earned economic dollar to be around unfriendly staff people.  The last time I went there they screwed up and didn't put in our order which made myself and 2 friends late to our engagement.  They lost 3 customers that day.    Honestly, it just goes to show that you can not even say hello to people, be grumpy and unfriendly, but if you have good food that has little competition around, people will still support you.  It really is amazing.  However, not this guy...not anymore."}
{"text":"best! I have had here in the Valley....10 yrs in California I was spoiled."}
{"text":"I love this no nonsense joint for so many reasons. It's delicious, fast and super affordable. I don't know what I would do without my weekly pho and crispy spring roll fix. Best crispy spring rolls I've had in the Phx area. While I don't often stray from my weekly fix, the egg noodle soups and buns bowls with bbq pork are also fantastic menu items, as are the fresh pork and shrimp spring rolls if you aren't into fried apps.   It's also a wonderful take-out option, as they include everything expertly stored for transportation, and a delicious meal at home.   I don't like to think too much about the sanitary problems that may or may not exist with this place because I love it so much. Good news is that they've expanded once again, so the wait at lunch for a table won't be so brutal."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Vietnamese place to eat. Their egg rolls are delicious and I think they have the best pho. The service is mediocre but for the price, I really have no complaints."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was 9 years old. It used to be called Pho Bang, and the food only got better and better over the years. So now, upon my 16th year coming here, it is still our go-to date night. The food is always fresh and crispy. We always get the #32 Seafood Udon, with a BBQ pork Bahn Mi, and a couple ordered of Egg rolls. Maybe a Summer roll every now and then. Its worth the line, its worth the crowd, its worth the price (most definitely worth the affordable price!) Oh! and don't forget to order a Thai Tea! Thanks Pho Thanh!!!!"}
{"text":"The pho is delicious, and the prices are fantastic.  Definitely a hole in the wall and very authentic (not much English spoken here).  Down side is that they don't serve beer (wha?! who doesn't drink beer with their pho?!) but otherwise 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.  Will come here whenever we're on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, the pho soup is so greasy, very poor service, I came here looking for great pho but instead it was a dissapointment, I was out of town and leaving Arizona that day and wanted some Pho and it was unpleasant."}
{"text":"I wanted to preface my statement with something positive. I love Vietnamese culture, family values & yes, the food! I've frequented this particular Vietnamese restaurant several times & noticed even with a nice tip for good service it still felt \"cold\". Today's visit we ordered as usual. My partner needed additional rice. She was ignored by two different staff members?! I can understand if it's not your particular function. If not, let someone else be aware. Finally, we asked a third person & he fulfilled the order of rice. Today was noisier then usual with the busboy organizing & preparing utensils. Later, I asked my partner, (she is Vietnamese ) why the cold reception from the male employees. She says it's normal for Vietnamese men to harbor contempt & general disregard for woman who date outside of their race. Really.  pfft"}
{"text":"I agree with others who have said about the broth being too oily and fatty. Noodles were fine, but I couldn't even finish half the bowl before I started getting grossed out and had to eat from my husband's bbq pork sandwhich instead, which was actually pretty decent. I'm a big carnivore, but even I thought the spring rolls lacked veggies, too much meat and pretty tasteless. Service was HORRIBLE! You're lucky if u can even get some eye contact with the service once your meal has been served. Soda was served straight from the can - no glass, not even a straw. Definitely not worth the 12 mile drive!"}
{"text":"I tried Pho Thanh today after much hype. I read about it in the Phoenix New Times \"Best Of Phoenix 2011\" and felt like if it got a great review then I should put it on the list.   Here is a run down of the order:   Spring Rolls  Lean Pork Sammich Pho with Filet  Broken Rice Thai Tea  We wanted to try a lot of food to get an idea of what the place was like and  even asked the waiter what the most popular items on the menu were. I usually don't opt for a fancy cut of meat in Pho but I decided to try it at his recommendation.   Spring Rolls- They tasted old and my dining partner said \"it tastes like each ingredient\". What he meant was, it felt like he was eating rice paper, pork, etc. It didn't feel cohesive. When I tried it I thought the rice paper was gummy and the roll was super bland. The peanut sauce on the side was also a little meh.   Lean Pork Sammich- I like the addition of pickled daikons but the meat was lacking. The waiter commented that there was a lot of seasoning but I felt it was bland.   Pho- Oh dear. I was so looking forward to a great tender slice of filet in a rich, complex broth. I was truly disappointed in this dish. The broth was flat (my dining partner agreed) and the noodles were a bit off. They almost tasted old or undercooked. They stuck together and were chewy. (If you want good Pho, Da Vang is a good option. I am still on the lookout for more options)   Broken rice- My dining partner had this one and liked it, but didn't love it. I know when he loves things and this didn't wow him at all. I wish I had more commentary on this. Sorry.   Thai Tea- It is pretty hard to fuck up Thai tea. This was executed well.   I am going to possibly give this place one more shot. I liked the waitstaff, the restaurant was clean and the prices were very fair. We walked out with a bill of $20, which is pretty crazy."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  The food is excellent and the service varies from slow to fast depending on the day of the week.  It's packed on Saturdays.  They just expanded and the place is bigger now.  This is the 2nd time I've been there and the experience this time was a lot better.  The food is fresh and the flavors are great.  The menu is 3 pages and has lots of choices.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"In Phoenix we all are subject to a number of poor food choices that claim they're \"authentic\", and its anything but. However all is not lost: Behold the great Pho Thanh, the best Vietnamese food in the valley. Lets slurp up a bowl of pho-knowledge in this review on this restaurant!  ~Fud/Drink~ This small, unassuming restaurant off of Camelback has amazing flavors popping out of the kitchen. The Pho is fresh, not made from different canned ingredients. The dishes are out of this world and very much authentic. For a good starter, the spring rolls they make are huge and sumptuous. With mint, shrimp, and pork, my personal favorite is Goi Cuon. As for entrees, by far the best out of my first three visits is #31 on the menu, Mi Xao Don . The freshly cooked veggies along with cooked pork and fresh broth-boiled seafood mix amazingly together atop a bed of crispy egg noodles. If you can stand waiting a few minutes, I suggest crushing the noodles, add a bit of soy sauce/ other sauces, and let the noodles soak it all in. All the dishes are succulent, savory, and the prices for the quantity of food is out of this world. I have left each time with leftovers, the portions are that big. They have over 100 separate dishes, the list is extensive, to say the least. They do not serve alcohol here, however the list of soft drinks and traditional Vietnamese offerings like baby coconut milk or thai tea is......extensive once again.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ This is the reason they lose a star. I am not a big atmosphere person, unless it simply detracts from the experience all-together. There are three separate issues to point out. First, the music and decor in the restaurant....they  are \"interesting\". They have it seemingly on a looped CD with Vietnamese covers of popular American music. I cannot tell a lie, at one point \"She Bangs\" came on... I hadn't heard that in over 5 years, folks. The decor is once again \"interesting\" and detracts from the experience. Instead of adding to the atmosphere and putting up traditional pictures or decor, they have two separate posters of a woman threading a blanket. TWO posters....as if one is not enough. Second, is the bathroom. You can smell it as you walk towards it. They seem to not have a scheduled time to clean up the bathroom each day, its pretty bad. Third, the service is extremely prompt, let me make this abundantly clear.  Faster than I have seen at most food establishments for that matter. But if you were to ask them for recommendations, it may prove to be difficult, as they are in a hurry to service other tables. We do not get many smiles or get asked how we are doing....To be honest, I am sure its a cultural thing. I shrug it off, if you take things like that to heart then you need to check yourself. Overall, these aren't hideous issues, but a star lost is more than fair, in my mind.  ~Extras/Rating~ Overall, the food is outstanding. They get 4 stars for variety of choices, quality/taste of food, price point in comparison to quanitity, and lightning fast service. But honestly, \"She Bangs\"?  If not for those issues, its a 5 star top choice for me. Regardless, this has become my favorite go-to spot locally. I have gone 3 times the past two weeks, and at some point this week and next I shall go again....and I can't wait. Bring on the Pho Thanh, I say!!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is a must try. Everything is so fresh. The Pho is incredible. The office goes at least once a week and everyone agrees that this is their favorite restaurant. If you're new try what looks good. Look around ..the place is usually packed. I just started to ask people  around me what was good. I love the birds nest but have been trying new things on the menu. Try it once....you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The service was fast and food was great.  Best Pho I've had.  Will be coming back for sure.  Went to milk run next door after for a snack"}
{"text":"Bruh what's wrong with people's taste buds. Sadly I Did not like this place at all. I ordered the 51 which is the spicy soup bun bo hue. It wasn't even spicy . The spring rolls . I'd prefer to eat @ PT noodles."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows PHO will want to try this restaurant out.  The building and parking need a major overhaul, but the food is inexpensive and well worth the drive to Pho Thanh.  Honestly, my wife and I have been to almost every vietnamese place in town, and the spring rolls here are spectacular because they will substitute chicken in place of pork.  I had the Pho with filet steak and it was the bomb! Super fresh ingredients, juicy and tender meat and no sign of MSG headache afterwards.  So we go here about twice a week now, and we try all the stuff on the menu and it is all GREAT!!  Very casual dress here."}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed pho aficionado, have tried too many pho joints over the years. . So I am a hard reviewer.  As soon as you pull up there is a vietnamese grocery store, beauty salon, and fast food takeout, also a guy in a hoodie at the corner asking for food.  We walk in and the place it pretty busy, good sign, greeted right away and pointed to our seat for two. Looking at the menu, prices are very reasonable and we decided on the number 3, 15, and 31 with two sprites at only 99 cents our final total was only $23.  Service was lightning fast, and I was very  impressed up to this point in fact my husband and I even talked about making this our new spot. Within 5 minutes our order started coming out; First up the #3 eggrolls - good, not fresh but above average. Then it all went downhill.. Second was #15 beef and brisket pho (which i only ordered because they don't have well done brisket) broth was good, again, above average! But then we really started noticing the meat and I kept needing to spit out the meat from my mouth due to the chewy-ness, and after the initial 'too-hungry-to-notice' what we were eating phase, we REALLY noticed the meat was YUCKY. Yellow, nerves, white, and almost going to expire meat. So we stopped half way done with our meal because there was no way we could finish this without self inducing vomitt.  Then #31 'egg nest' which is one of my favorite meals ever, WHEN DONE RIGHT. There was no denying the egg noodles used here were stale even after they deep fried them. Very low quality of meats and veggies were used here again. The sauce was OK but not the thickness or consistency we enjoy and love.  Overall we were very sad and let down by this place, we had high expectations given all the yelp reviews but maybe they use to use better quality ingregients? Whatever the case we won't be going back.  Serving sizes were okay, but these yelpers believe in QUALITY over quantity."}
{"text":"We go at least once a week, and have, in the past gone twice in 1 day. It used to be a different Pho place which was also good, this place \"insert cliche for amazing here\". The freshness of all the herbs and veggies, the out of this world level of umptuous savory goodness... Simply put, it's a great place. And super easy on the wallet too. It was, at one time, filled with only Vietnamese people. We would be the only ones in the restaurant of another ethnicity- side note, when going to an 'ethnic' restaurant, its usually a good sign to see people from that region as patrons.   Somehow the secret has escaped and it is quite multicultural now. It's refreshing to see Hispanic, Caucasians, and Vietnamese all rubbing elbows while inhaling a hot bowl of Pho!   I feel as the pictures should speak for themselves...   Here's the info... But don't overrun the place. We don't like going and not having somewhere to sit!  Google recognizes it as:  Pho Bang Restaurant  Ste 14, 1702 West Camelback Road  Phoenix  1 (602) 242-1979   LOVE IT! Very authentic and so amazing."}
{"text":"I was looking for the highest rated Pho in Phoenix and glad I went. It was everything you expect out of a good, local Vietnamese place....fast, average service, ehh bathrooms and really good food & coffee at a great price.  I would go again any time...just know what you're getting when you go to these places and stop whining :)"}
{"text":"Great pho! All the fixings are so fresh. And better yet Milk Run is next door! I usually am committed to my fav spot in Scottsdale but this is a great replacement when I don't feel like making the drive. Nothing like a bowl of Pho when you're not feeling well!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend believes this place has the best pho around, and he rants about their spring rolls. I must admit it is all pretty good. That being said I don't care how good the food is when the service is so bad. I don't expect anything over the top when it comes to a vietnamese restaurant, but I do expect to not feel uncomfortable. It seems like a bother to ask for anything (like your water to be refilled).   The moment I can convince my boyfriend someone else's rolls are as good I hope we never have to come back."}
{"text":"OMG!  This is hands down the best pho in Phoenix.  Better than Maxim, better than Da Vang by far!  The portions are huge (take note staff of Central King Eggroll in Avondale, send someone down here so you can see how it SHOULD be done!!)  The large Pho with filet mignon is melt in your mouth.  The broth is heavenly and they give you TONS of basil, cilantro and lime.  I had to pinch myself when I first ate here, I swore I was eating in the Westminster/Garden Grove, CA area.    This place is a MUST for all pho-addicts!"}
{"text":"Still a huge fan, but having now compared it fully to Da Vang. I think DV's grilled pork (thit nung) is a little better.  Since its such a staple ingredient to so many dishes it's a difference maker to me."}
{"text":"Considering the fact we eat here 3-4 times a week my previous 4-star rating seems ridiculous.  This is really a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time this evening. Could see walking in that it was packed so we were worried about a long wait. Luckily we were seated right away due to the steady flow of people going in and out.   Located in a strip mall area with a few other Asian stores and restaurant, this place is definitely a simple, no-frill joint. In an open lit-up room filled with tables and chairs sat very diverse groups of customers. I liked the casual atmosphere but was less impressed with the lack of customer service. They weren't rude by any means, but don't expect any friendly chit-chats or having the server check up on you often.    After our order was taken by our nice waitress, it was a while before we got our food. When the food finally came, I found it amusing when a man solemnly placed a tray with our food on the table and started just handing out the bowls of pho in silence. It made no difference who ordered what so we passed the food around the table. Since we dine out often, the lack of customer interaction was new, but I think common at many Asian restaurants. It's not about the customer service, but the food. And let me tell you- the food was VERY good. Not to mention- CHEAP!   I was not impressed with the Spring rolls (it tasted bland to me) but the pho & broth was very delicious and flavorful. The perfect choice for the cold weather. It's nice to see that they were generous with the meat, unlike a few other restaurants. Everyone enjoyed their food and I'm certain we'll definitely return to try other things on the menu. Throughout our meal, no one checked on us or refilled our water. We had to flag the waitress down and she rectified the situation. To make up for the lack of service, I was glad we weren't given a hard time for splitting the bill. There wasn't a minimum for using your card, unlike a lot of other Vietnamese places. They were very nice about it actually.  Overall, it was a decent experience. The yummy food and price will definitely keep the customers coming! Although it's kind of far from me, I wouldn't mind returning when I'm in the mood for some good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Best and cheapest  Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix! You can get an extra large pho by only $8.95 with tons of meat!!! This place is always packed but there is usually no waiting time. I have actually been to their competitor Da Vang(I think that's the name..) cuz they were closed for one month during Chinese New Year. Da Vang is not bad. But to me Vietnamese food is not hard and should be cheap to make. Therefore I still think this place is the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best pho in the valley. Service is not the most attentive but it is super fast. Crazy busy all the time. Menu can be intimidating to peeps new to the cuisine. I recommend the 113 (pho with higher grade cut of beef), broken rice (pork chop, egg, shrimp, crabby/fishy cakes, fried tofu pockets, all served over rice), grilled pork bon me sandwich (purple mayo is amazing, comes with jalapeños on it), and the grilled beef wrapped in grape leaves appetizer. Avoid the standard \"Asian\" dishes like broccoli beef - not what they specialize in. The Thai iced tea is sweet and smokey. There is also an espresso with condensed milk that is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Yummy and always delecious with fast service. Great place for a quick bite. Soup is one of the best dishes there along with some egg rolls. Always busy but still always on time for ordering and getting your food."}
{"text":"Best pho ever!!!!! I am very picky about my pho and the taste but here it is perfect! All kind and types and a larger size for extra goodness! Quick service and never here too long. I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at this neighborhood noodle joint. Service is not overly friendly but efficient and no matter how busy the restaurant may be, the service is never inattentive. The menu is huge and varied. Great Thai tea."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and was looking for some good Vietnamese food and this one came up. It had pretty good ratings compared to a few of its competitors so we decided to go here. Being from San Jose where we are spoiled with so many good Vietnamese food options, this one didn't really meet the bar for me. Don't get me wrong, the food is not horrible and is probably the best in the area. However, I felt the broth was slightly bland and oily. The noodles are also extra soft (which was different from what I'm used to). I think it's just preference, but this is still a good Vietnamese restaurant for the area!"}
{"text":"I got so excited I forgot to take a picture of the rare sliced beef pho I ordered :/  But I will share a picture of my app which was just as scrump-dee-lee-oh-so.  All of the folks I interacted with were at least bilingual.....a few with thicker accents than others. But, who cares about that?  I came for the pho-n of it!!! ;) ;) see what I did there? :p \(^_^.)/"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now and it's still by far one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. The food is authentic and inexpensive. Of course there is Pho but I love the vermacelli noodles and #59 the best. 42 and 59. 59 had a a bit of everything. See the pic! I call it the truth. Get you some"}
{"text":"I love this spot ! Excellent pho! They give extra beef if you ask.  The pho noodles don't get super plump and swollen if they sit in the bowl for awhile. They maintain  their shape as it takes me awhile to chow down on all that deliCiousness . The bowl is huge ! What I like is its not your typical restaurant. You expect them to wait on you but they don't. They'll take your order and deliver your order and if you catch them going around dropping off dishes or picking up dirty dishes that is when you ask for a refill of drink. You walk up to the counter when your done and tell them what table you were at. They tell you your total and you leave. Must be a cultural thing but who cares with pho that awesome !"}
{"text":"Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.  Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall."}
{"text":"This pho restaurant is located near an Asian grocery store in a strip mall. The interiors have high ceilings and are quite airy, with artificial floral decorations; other than that, it's quite no-frills like your typical Vietnamese restaurants.   I tried:   - Bun Bo Hue (XL), #19: I was expecting a hearty thick broth like the type you can find in Ottawa; unfortunately, the broth was much lighter (like a spicy sate soup base), but nonetheless, it was perfectly comforting on a cold snowy night!   - One of the vermicellis (pork): perfectly grilled with charcoal bits, this was really satisfying and had enough flavour.   Service was attentive and quick. They refill the hot tea often! Overall, not outstanding, but still very solid for pho in Montreal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner at 7:50 (they close at 8:30). There were several tables of diners as well as a couple parties of 5+. T  There was a lot of trash under the tables (like chopstick paper, napkins, etc) so I don't know if they were super messy diners, or if the staff just doesn't tidy up until closing... Slightly off-putting.  Our server was prompt but not super friendly.  I honestly would like to know where people in food service heard it would hurt them to smile on occasion. I'm not going to leave you a Smaller tip for being friendly!  Anyhoo,  Food was all very fast. We ordered spring rolls with shrimp ($2.25). Pretty good served with a sweet-ish brown sauce of sorts that I can't figure out what it was.  We got the Pho with filet and tendon for around $5. Very taste. Lots of green stuff to add. We also ordered the Lemongrass Chicken. Twas very oily and got some pretty firm bits of lemongrass, but a really nice flavor with chiles as well.   They were out of Thai tea :( and Ben ordered a plum drink that was pretty good, however salty (which I think is probably how it's supposed to be, but being a typical American who does NOT put salt in her beverages, it was a little much)  I'd go back."}
{"text":"The Pho Broth was exquisitie.  Very nice.  I ordered Pho Tai Gan (Pho with Rare Beef and Tendon).  Delicious.  I gave it 4 stars because of the amount of MSG in it.  Wiped me out for a good 4 hours and I woke up with a minor headache.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given it 5 stars.  This place is packed, crowded and big on a Saturday afternoon.  Lots of tables and mostly taken up.  I give them 5 stars for service.  I got my Pho within 5 minutes order.  Very good for such a busy place.  Nice people."}
{"text":"For a year, I passed by Pho Thanh every day on my way to work. For a year, I never thought once to step inside. For a year, I had no idea how much I was missing out!   This visit was a visit of firsts. My first time at this restaurant and my first time eating Vietnamese food. Both were spectacular! This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside, but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff, cheap prices and delicious dishes.   I will admit that the menu is completely overwhelming for a newbie like me. I had no idea what I wanted, but luckily I was dining with pros so they guided me in the right direction. I started with the spring rolls and opted for a pork bun. The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!  Guess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious! For the price alone, I will return, but for the food and friendly service, I will return sooner."}
{"text":"Great Prices, Not Talkative Service  Come here to eat, not make friends with the staff. Lol... Nobody has anything to say at all here! Lol.  I really like that food is $6.95 here... Pho or vermicelli bowls are my usual routine and this place doesn't disappoint.   I would rate the Pho flavor at 3.6 Out if 5 stars and 4.5 out if 5 for serving size!  Vermicelli bow is a 4.1 out of 5 for flavor and  5 out of 5 for serving size!  Stop by and feed you inner animals and after go to milk run next door for treats."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in town, hands down. Do not come here expecting service or hospitality. This is just face value: delicious, fresh, authentic food served as it comes.  Great prices, great flavor, great value."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE, EXTREMELY RUDE STAFF, AND TREATED LIKE BEGGARS. Last time my family and I will be coming here (all together 6 people). We gave Pho Thanh multiple tries but I can say with complete confidence that there are other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley with amazing food, cheap prices, and high quality service, such as Da Vang or PT Noodles. Seriously though, you can skip Pho Thanh.   Upon entering this place we were ignored and stared at, so we picked a table. It was so awkward because this place had no music playing, customers were eating in awkward silence, and you have the staff slamming dishes in the background. We waited to be served. After 20 minutes no one helped us. We walked up to the cashier and got the menus by ourselves. We only had one waiter walk up towards our table to only ask us if were using the table next to us. We waited up to 35 minutes and still received no service. Also, this was an okay day for the restaurant. It wasn't too busy or slow at all. My parents had to call them in Vietnamese for assistance.   When taking our order, no surprise, they were even more rude to a point that my dad commented how they treat their customers like beggars because this restaurant knows they cook good food. Additionally, my mother overheard them gossiping in Vietnamese about the other customers behind the other customers' backs. This is coming from someone whose family used to own a Vietnamese restaurant and I'm giving everyone a heads up that this is not normal behavior for Vietnamese restaurants. Customers should not be treated like this. Unfortunately, their food cannot beat their consistent terrible customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a all time favorite of ours. So many different options, super fresh veggies, super tender cuts of meat, most refreshing handmade drinks & always busy which is a sign your at the right place! We can't eat here enough!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Seattle and being Vietnamese myself, I know when I have good Viet food. First sign I noticed was that the Vietnamese patron ratio was underwhelming. Hmm, where my peeps at? I couldn't finish my bun cha goi thit nuong (pork vermicelli noodles and egg rolls), because the noodles were tough--cooked, but poor quality. My vegetables did not seem fresh; some of the zucchini were mildly soggy. No thanks. I'll go across the way to Da Vang."}
{"text":"I consider myself an aPHOcianado and this place is great! The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone who enjoys Asian dining. The place is a ZOO between 1130am and 130pm so if you have a flexible schedule get there off-peak to avoid waiting in line. The place is HUGE in terms of Pho retaurants, but still gets a line. The broth is fine, but I will say that I find it a little weak in flavor. I have had pho that I enjoyed more at other places. Lucky for me I also enjoy countless other dished they do a great job on, so I just get something else. I have had the special spicy Bun soup (minus the pork blood) and it was tasty. I draw the line at beef tendon which I LOVE! Sorry tripe and pork blood, but you will remain on my if-i-were-starving-to-death-on-a-life-raft-desert-island-mountain-top-last-resort-before-eating-another-person list. With all Pho places, be sure to check the hours. They tend to take a weekday off and often close early like before 9pm. This place is closed tuesdays and always closes at 830pm. However, they open at 830am so it's not unlike me to head over for some Vietnamese chow for breakfast! The owners also run the asian market a few doors down which is also huge and sells tons of great asian products and cheap fresh produce, so open your mind away from Safeway and check it out. They have like 150 different brands of soy sauces as well as a million other amazing treats and funky products, so I always have a boo in there after I eat. If ever I want actual Pho soup, I head over to their competition at Da Vang on 19th Ave south of Camelback.. Awesome broth! Is Pho Thanh my new regular spot? Pho Sho'!!"}
{"text":"I've decided to base this review on my wife's opinion of the food here because I tend to be too strict on these types of establishments having frequented close to 100 different Pho places.   As for food, she rates this place an 8 of 10. For service, granted they were busy, it was just a 6 of 10. If I could have rated them a 3.5, I would have. But between a 3 and a 4, I had to choose 4 because the food was pretty good.   As for parking, the center is small and parking was a premium. We were early birds so we found parking, but as we were leaving, we can see people fighting for spots. Prepare your during popular dining hours."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho and summer rolls. Have also had it to go which is nice. Service could he a bit friendlier. Great Thai iced read and iced coffee!! Parking can be a bit tricky but there is extra parking around back!"}
{"text":"The price and pho was awesome. The waiter was great with helping me figure out what to get. Tried #11, loved the beef tendon and tender meat but not a fan of the meatballs (there was a tiny bone in mine). I am a spoiled NYC bahn mi eater so the bahn mi wasn't my favorite (I thought the meat was too fatty) but the boyfriend liked the BBQ pork bahn mi. I also love the do it yourself take home containers, homemade hot sauce, and I even heard they will refill your broth. Bring an appetite, even with the normal size I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"By far the best Pho in the central phoenix area. Number 121 is my favorite. If you get a chance the market nextdoor makes the best steam pork buns fresh!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese I've had in the valley. The service was a little slow on Sunday, but would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town, you will love the family atmosphere, it's very inexpensive and always annexing."}
{"text":"Love love love! We go on average once a week. Love the meatball pho with added veggies and the grapeleaf wrapped beef rolls. I have also had the vermcelli salad with lemongrass which is delish but am addicted to the pho.  Have also gone to Da Vang and it is great too. Love that reviewers call them \"competitors\". I am pretty sure it is the same family but not sure."}
{"text":"Well I was going to add a review and pics. Bc I eat here all the time but I have experienced something very displeasing at Pho Thanh every time I go there.  Servers and personnel can be very rude and Racist. Food: Delicious! But u get tired of the uncomfortable stares and blatant \"we don't want you here\" attitude.   Africans would not do this at our restuarants.  I recommend Da Vang, they are a bit more welcoming and open minded about all skin colors spending money at there business."}
{"text":"I love this spot. It is my most favorite pho spot, possibly in the entire US, definitely in Phoenix. The service is terrible, but I expected that. I think only culturally American spots would even consider service an important quality in a good restaurant. This place focuses on the food. It's all about the delicious (and surprisingly inexpensive) food."}
{"text":"Magical.  I had a fresh coconut water and got the chicken pho and it was beautiful. Best pho I've had in a long time. I used to live in NYC and they had some amazing pho places but this trumps even them!  Highly recommend if you're feeling unwell; pho is magical and will beat your cold!  My boyfriend got the beef pho without noodles (he's low carb) and his was amazing as well. Loved that they have Thai basil to add in the pho as well. So yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is always super busy but they seat you down pretty quick.  The pho here is quite flavorable.  They are fast and quick. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First stop on my new life in Phoenix and wow did this place impress. The egg rolls are amazing and the pho broth is one of the best I've had in a long time. Will come again to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Service is fast. Pho is delicious, and the price is right. Will be coming back again and again when I'm craving pho!"}
{"text":"So far, this has been the best pho takeout place I've encountered in Phoenix/Tempe.  The broth is EXQUISITE. It smelled a little funky but it tastes fabulous. Hearty, flavorful, and extremely satisfying. PHO = BROTH. I would give ten stars for their broth if I could.  I like that they separate the cilantro and onions from the noodles (in the takeout box). I don't mind having raw onion in the broth to add a little more flavor, but I hate that lingering taste.  I would have given them a full five stars, but their chicken meat is rubbery and dry. Probably the quality of the beef is better since beef can be served rare and cook a little in the hot broth, but I don't like fatty meats.   Also, it's a bit pricier than expected for pho. Back home in Colorado, I could get a large bowl of pho for under $6.50. Here, it comes to just under $8."}
{"text":"Fast service, clean location. Best pho I had in Phoenix. The only complaint I had was the parking. The parking space out front was really small, I didn't know there was more parking in the back. Maybe they should put a sign saying more parking In the back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pho's I've ever had. They were packed when we went, had quick service, the chili paste and sauces were all out and ready to use if you want, and very reasonable prices.  Just had Pho Dalat on Kyrene... it doesn't even compare to this place.  Pho Thanh is cheaper and tastier, just go here if you want Pho. I regret going to Pho Dalat today and wish we went here instead..."}
{"text":"You can't beat the prices at Pho Than!  The pho and all the food here is delicious :) This restaurant is spacious and kept clean. The restaurant is always busy but the service is fast. If your in the area and craving some good pho come check this place out."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting. Almost every dish was a soup of sorts. Ordered the beef stew (soup) and chicken with rice (soup). Good flavor and garnish. Especially if you were feeling under the weather. I was looking for a more hearty meal. But still filled me up pretty well and held me over till the next meal."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Pho!  Generally I do order Pho at Pho restaurants and sometimes I get adventurous.  My mistake - I should stick to what I'm good at...eating Pho.  I would recommend the same to you too.  Tried to order something different and I wasn't too wow'd about it.  However, the Pho is excellent - tasty and cheap!  They have whole coconut drinks here --- not my cup of tea but if you're a fan by all means.  The decor is nothing to rave about.  Cheap Vietnamese art, but I totally dig the cheesy Vietnamese music videos (my dad loves them haha!), but that's the way it's supposed to be!  The place is like little Saigon, my Vietnamese sistas and bros hanging out for a meal.  I'm surprised no one is smoking :)  - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I said down in this restaurant had my food within 10 minutes or less.  The price was right the service was great and I would definitely come back again, really unbelievable value."}
{"text":"Food:  Banh Hoi Nem Nuong/Chao Tom: fine vermicelli noodles with grilled pork. This plate came with 2 types of nem nuong which is unique. I liked one more than the other. The round cut nem nuong was sliced thinly. The meat was sweet and delicious. The other one was a longer, thicker cut. The meat was sightly overcooked (just how I like it), but there were big chunks of fat (not how I like it). I was confused when I ordered, I thought you get nem nuong and  chao tom (grilled shrimp paste on a stick of sugarcane) but it's one or the other. The waiter was nice and gave me an order of nem nuong with 1 chao tom to try. I liked the nem nuong better than the chao tom. The chao tom wasn't bad but the nem nuong had more flavor. The dish came with a huge plate of veggies, which is always a plus! 3/5  Service: We were seated immediately. The waiters/servers look gangster (tatted up) but they were all really nice and polite. They were attentive and refilled our water cup twice. The restroom isn't the cleanest, the ladies' room was out of paper towels. 3/5  Final thoughts: I would like to come back and try other dishes. They have a wide variety of authentic Vietnamese food at a decent price"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's been a while due to lack of customer service, and guess what? It strikes again.   First, our order was messed up. Ok, they fixed it, but only after struggling to find someone else since our server mysteriously vanished.  Then, we tried to order some more drinks. Where did our server go? Oh, I see him. I made eye contact, and got ignored. I made eye contact and waved at several people, still no service. After finally getting a response (from the 4th person) our drinks are ordered. Do they come? No. Does the guy sitting next to me who ordered the same drink after me get his first? Yes.  I then went to the owner, who tried to tell me that there were only 2 servers working. As someone who has been a server and restaurant manager for 10+ years, I notice everything in the restaurant.  Everything. Especially the fact that there were 5 servers, 3 bussers, 2 managers, and when I'm being blatantly ignored and lied to. After talking to the owner and explaining all of this, his response was, \"what do you want me to do about it?\" Really? That's the response? I was appalled. I said you could work on customer service & satisfaction, he did give 2 Thai teas, but with much dissatisfaction and making me feel like an unwanted customer the entire conversation."}
{"text":"I have yet to actually have the pho here... so I'll have to update when I do.   The com tam/broken rice plates here are really good and well priced.  And for that, 4 stars!!!!  Be prepared for crazy crazy crowds/parking lot/staff if you venture here for lunch. Even on a week day. Even if you are just picking up a take out order. It is truly insane. But worth it? Perhaps. We shall see after the pho has been tried."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner before heading to a show at the Rhythm Room. I LOVE Vietnamese cuisine and will never pass up a chance to have some! Unfortunately I wish I had this time.   I ordered the chicken curry dish. It was the most disappointing curry I've ever had (I love curry and was really excited for this). It was thing, watery, and bland. Very little spice or flavors. Only had half a potato and a few onions, and the chicken - oh god the chicken. It was a whole chicken, including skin, which had been chopped up and thrown into the curry. I tried picking off meat from the little bones, but I came up with little edible chicken. About 1/3 way through the dish I had to stop eating because every other bite resulted in little chicken bone fragments. Gross.   My boyfriend got the pho with shrimp and extra veggies. Quite bland as well, and the only veggies that came with it was broccoli. Really? At other Vietnamese restaurants you get tons of different veggies!   We both ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee and it was incredible. But it wasn't good enough to make up for the food. :( I'm always sad to have subpar Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Very authentic vietnamese restaurant. The pho is delicious, although they do NOT have vegetarian pho. They have a whole section for vegetarians but for some reason they do not make a vegetarian soup broth.   The service was also lacking. My 2 friends got their food about 10 minutes before I did and all I ordered was a sweet and sour soup. It also took them about 25 minutes to bring out our coconut for desert."}
{"text":"So I had been here a few times alone. Then I took my family twice not thinking it was Tuesday and they were closed. My husband was starting to wonder what was so great. So we went again on a Wednesday this time they were closed for the week. He said never mind forget about this place. So last night I told him let's go have Pho. And with frustration in his voice he said where. You know that place on camelback I called to make sure they were open. He feel in love. Said it was better then the place in Mesa we go to. My very picky 9 year old ate all her food. That says a lot!!!!  Our bill was 32.00 for my family of 4. With appetizers. So worth every penny. Stays very busy always a good sign."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always really busy.  My favorite is the lemongrass chicken and periwinkle drink."}
{"text":"Love this place. I typically order the pho ga or pho tai. Spring rolls are awesome as well! Really I don't think there's anything you could order here and go wrong - the other reviews paint a good picture of the fare. My only real gripe is the \"to go\" (or lack thereof) service. They don't answer their phone / I regularly get a weird message about their mailbox. So ordering ahead is next to impossible. If you're planning on placing a to go order - proceed directly back to the payment counter. I usually just pop a squat in front of the to go shelves they have to the right of the payment counter if I can to wait - they don't really have a process for it. They also just kinda toss the to go orders over there. So be watchful for yours. If that process was a little easier this place would shine even more."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I would give it 5 stars if they did not have such bright fluorescent lighting, which makes the place feel like a hospital cafeteria. Beyond the aesthetics, the food is authentic and very tasty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've now been here twice, one to eat in and one to carry out.  All in all, great prices, decent service, and semi-good food.  I've had the pho when I sat down and ate at the restaurant.  Not the best I've had, but at the price, really good and fulfilling.  When I've carried out: had the bun thit nuon.  Great stuff. Mi xao and hu tieu xao were just ok.  I like that the whole place is very big (from a recent expansion, I'm reading).   The bathrooms are pretty good and the service is not too typical Viet: actually friendly-ish and not too rude/brusque.  I would come back again for sure. The prices are what you would find in California, so that is just too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Food here is very cheap. Two people, we ordered 3 things and it's only 20 things. We were only able to finish half of the food. The food quality is ok. It's pretty fatty. Next time, we will order less."}
{"text":"The service here is bad, they don't care to give you a refill, or even smile. Bathrooms aren't clean... Blah blah.. Despite this, Still gets 5 stars because the PHO is that dang good, and the spring rolls are a must. Come, get... It."}
{"text":"The food is super authentic.  We were recommended to this restaurant and when we walked in we thought \"this is going to suck\"....and we were wrong.  It was terrific food.  I could have done without the bright lights but the Banh Mi was worth it."}
{"text":"They have the best pho I have ever tasted.  The only reason why i didn't put 5 starts is because the service is not that great. Overall great food not so great service."}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic vietnamese food at vietnamese prices! This place is always pretty packed/busy, but the service is fast and the food is bountiful and filling.  While the pho is good I prefer to go with the wonton noodle soup or the com tam dac biet. I also feel a little less guilty whenever eating here because it tastes more like a homecooked meal than a greasy, heavier meal I'd order at some other sit down restaurant. Only a slightly less guilty though. Whatever, I'm still coming back here multiple times a week! They close around 830 or 9pm too so make sure to plan ahead of time so you don't arrive right as they lock the doors on ya."}
{"text":"Everything tasted right, exactly the same as the noodle soup I used to have in Orange county, CA.  It's hot but I was happy to sweat, so I don't need to power walk. Definitely will return even it's 20 minutes drive from Paradise Valley. However... I didn't try to be demanding. Just curious.  The noodle soup with sliced beef and tendon was $1.45 more expensive than the one without tendon. The server was impatient when I asked, \" will I get the same amount of slices of beef if I order the one with tendon?\"  She said, \"yeah...\" then rushed to put her menus away.  The fact is....not the same amount of slices for these two soups. Why did I asked? I'm expecting to have much less tendons than beef but my wish didn't come true. Guess my expectations don't usually come true and you ladies know why we should expect nothing from our significant ones....always...."}
{"text":"Good food, ok service. I got the duck salad and it's was definitely two meals of food. Would go again."}
{"text":"Mom and pop shop!  Wonderful flavors. Great portions. Great prices.  NOT fine dining, very much more cafe style. Prompt service, though a little on the cool side. But the food is exceptional!! Never have had a bad meal nor a bad experience. And I've been dozens of times and have tried dozens of items. The menu is huge and again, you absolutely CANNOT beat the prices."}
{"text":"So good! Officially my favorite pho place in Arizona.  Looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, but those always end up being the most delicious places. The coconut water came in an actual coconut (that we ate and it was really tasty and fresh) and it was VERY refreshing.  For my pho, I ordered off the menu with the better grade meat and got the one with everything in it and added oxtail.  I tasted the broth before seasoning it and it was everything but bland! You could really taste the flavor of the meats that were cooked in it and if I wasn't so addicted to sriracha, I would've eaten it plain.  I also asked for half noodles (something I always do because I can't finish) and for once, I actually had 70% meat and 30% noodles. Bottom line: this place does not skimp out on meat like most other places do. I had so much meat that I barely finish it, and that is rare for me.  One thing that stood out the most to me and my friend (who ordered the tendon and brisket pho) was the quality if the tendon. It was flavorful and had just the right texture so you know it was fresh and not overcooked to the point where it was mushy.  The only thing I could've done without was the oxtail because it was kind of a pain to eat with so many people around. The place is big with plenty of seating and almost packed so we had to share a long table with another group, so if you're not into that don't come on a weekend afternoon. I'm definitely going to be frequenting this place even though it is 30 minutes from me, and I can't wait try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"Came back and I must say the service has change a lot.  They have great service and great pho for an affordable price.  My boyfriend and I keep on coming back. I love their pho.  I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for pho. Typical pho interior and vibe. I ordered the Pho Dac Biet or the Pho Special. I advise you guys to get a regular unless you can really eat then get the \"xe lua\" or large. Service was mediocre, no one seemed happy. Everyone seemed tired, dazed or not motivated. It took our server a while to come to take our order even though the store wasn't busy. I didn't like how big the rice noodles were and the broth could be better. What they lack in flavor they made up in portions though. You really get bang for your buck though. Overall, decent shop; I'd come and dine here if I wanted to save money but also get full on soup.   Interior: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit to Pho Thanh and again, I left with a very full belly (and not just because I'm pregnant!).  This place offers consistent, affordable Vietnamese food in large portions.  Highlights for me include the fresh young coconut, the shrimp spring rolls, and the stir fry noodle dishes.  Although, everyone who I've seen go with the pho seems pretty happy as well.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the company you go with will hopefully make up for that!  I went with my brother the first time and for the International Supper Club kick-off tonight, so needless to say, I was entertained during both visits.    Service is attentive although I did have to ask for my water to be refilled a couple of times.  They were great with our large group and were fine doing separate bills as well.  Oh, and they can do vegetarian entrees and pho upon request.  Bottom line: Pho Thanh is a pho-nomenal choice for affordable Vietnamese in Pho-enix!"}
{"text":"The pho here was really good. The atmosphere is a little too cramped and informal to give this place a better rating. But if you are looking for a casual lunch, this is a good spot for adventurous dishes."}
{"text":"I was actually quite impressed with this pho restaurant. It was pretty busy for at 1:40pm on a Wednesday afternoon.   I never order pho tai at a pho restaurant and decided to take a chance here. I was not disappointed by my choice at all. The broth contained a lot of flavor.   I highly recommend this place for pho!"}
{"text":"One of the best phos in town. Extremely reasonable price.  Her spring rolls are KILLER.  Get them. They're huge."}
{"text":"I used to love this little Pho place. It's a great place to eat during weeknights when it's slow. Usually they are quick to your table and attentive to your needs when you're eating in. That same courtesy is not extended when ordering to go. I have ordered to go three different times (Twice around 6pm on a Wednesday , once around 5pm on a Friday). All of these orders were placed 30 minutes in advance so that it would be ready once I got there to pick it up. All three times the order wasn't ready and I had to wait almost 30 minutes for them to make it (which was the whole point of me ordering in advance). When I went to pick up my take out order earlier this evening, they had no record of my order. He accused me of calling the wrong restaurant. When I showed them the number that I called and confirmed that it was in fact their restaurant, he might as well have said \"oh well\". He didn't offer to make it right by jumping my order to the front of the line. He didn't even apologize for their screw up. Pho restaurants are a dime a dozen now in the valley and I will definitely be finding another place to get my pho fixed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I get take out from this place all the time. It's delicious. I've gotten pho, sandwiches, and there specials. All of it is delicious, and I can't wait to try more. Long story short, come in here, and try anything, it's all good!"}
{"text":"Bomb, Bomb, and more BOMB!!! Place has the bomb-ass Pho! I've been to several around town and this one is the best. Pho-king delicious!"}
{"text":"After searching a few weeks for the perfect Pho, a friend of my boyfriends told us about this Vietnamese Restaurant. So we planned a double date and we all tried their Pho. Everyone except for me got the Beef Pho but my love for chicken won, as always, and I got the Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and I must say, I LOVE IT! The broth is not as flavorful and authentic as Viet Kitchen BUT for anyone trying Pho for the first time, I'd say this is the right place. It is so delicious, although I add fresh jalapenos, bean sprouts (they are fresher at Viet Kitchen), Sriracha, and plenty of lime juice. :)  As for the location, well, it is definitely a hole in the wall restaurant that is decent inside. It usually is busy and there is always something going on, whether it is more people walking in, the guy with the kart walking around cleaning tables, or just the restaurant being busy. It's what you would expect from a popular Vietnamese Restaurant. And their Vietnamese Iced Coffee is AMAZING. It is very strong yet sweet. I definitely recommend the Pho Ga and Cafe Sua Da (Iced Coffee).   For now, I have dubbed this place our go to restaurant for our Pho fix and it is worth the drive. Only downfall, the service is a bit slow because they are so busy. My boyfriend and I order as soon as we are seated, because we always get the same thing, to help prevent this issue BUT they are still not consistent enough with refilling waters. So, I recommend bring your own water bottle or you just may have to wait 20 minutes for a refill. Nonetheless, I do enjoy the vibe and food here."}
{"text":"VERY well regarded here on Yelp and filled with Vietnamese. I was the only non-Vietnamese of maybe 25 or 30 customers this visit. Another \"Bargain Priced\" bowl at $4.50 and was just too oily or greasy for me. Nice flavor, but the oiliness was fairly overwhelming and just did NOT enjoy as much as others, less oily.  Nice Spring Rolls but, although giving it two stars, would NOT repeat as the texture of the Pho threw me and kept me from enjoying it. Obviously \"locals\" were loving it as everyone had a big steaming bowl in front of them in 110 degree heat outside. Maybe the $4.50 low price tage is the attraction.  Doesn't compare to my two favorites: Dragonfly and Pho Ao Sen, both in Mesa"}
{"text":"Ordered iced coffee here and it's only under $3, and it took them a minute to make. It was delicious coffee! Place was packed so it must be very good food!"}
{"text":"This place was busy on a Sunday, and I anticipated good food.  Bad service but that usually translates to good food in Asian joints.  I had the pho tai, of course.  Since it's my first time here, I gotta try their pho.  It was pretty delicious!  My partner had the com tam thit.... and he liked it too.  Overall, good pho, bad service, pack restaurant, cheap = I'm happy.  I'll try this place again, when I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Been here ever since the birth of each of my grankids. Have our celebratory dinner here. :-)"}
{"text":"Hidden in the corner of a strip mall with an extremely busy parking lot..this place is no frills.  I was a little worried that if the parking lot were that full it might be a long wait but I got seated pretty quickly.  Service seems to be family style with everyone pitching in a long the way. I ordered the oxtail pho..b/c I've never seen that on a menu before and I love oxtail.  It was very good! Oxtail wasn't quite falling off the bone but definitely tender and they gave a generous portion.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Good food. Not enough seating and often gets busy. If you're white, they treat you with royalty. It's not a race thing, it's an Asian thing. The fancier you dress, the more they pay attention to you. Don't expect water to be constantly filled, you have to ask them. They aren't on top of it but that's how Asian places are. The Pho is great. Just about everything on the menu is good. Try it out. Go early."}
{"text":"I'm newly addicted to Pho and love this place! Of course, I order the traditional Pho Tai (thinly sliced beef), #12, and was not disappointed!! It was delicious! I finally remembered to order an iced coffee, I hear time and time again how Vietnamese iced coffee is so good, and hands down... Beats any fancy or regular ol' iced coffee I've ever had.  They bring this slow drip coffee contraption thing to your table, and once it's done brewing, you mix it up with the \"milk,\" I think that's what it is, and pour it over a glass of ice! So good!! Try it! No sugar or sweetener needed, by the way... I'm ignorant to these things, but trying them and glad I am!! Not a fancy place, but great service and great food! Authentic!"}
{"text":"Several years ago I went here with a large group and decided not to write a review until I tried it again as I was the only person that wasn't happy with the food and I was the only one that had made that menu choice, some sort of stir fried meat/veggie dish on noodles.  Recently I got a chance to go back with some folks and chose Pho and enjoyed it. It's still just a basic no atmosphere place but it serves up a lot of food fast and very inexpensively. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese Place in the Entire Phx Metro area!  Locations sucks but the food is sooo good...it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Warning! It can become addictive! Their food is the best Vietnamese food in the valley and recommend all their plates. It's always busy! But I don't mind because they have quick service. It's not a fancy place, but it is delicious."}
{"text":"There Vietnamese food is really good, and probably one of the best ones I've tried while living in AZ.  The price is very affordable and decent and it is just as comparable to CA or Houston, TX.  I would recommend this place if you are wanting authentic vietnamese food.  Their service is fast also!"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre..pho would be the best..I didn't like the bun bo hue at all..maybe because I have high expectations since I'm used to the food in California..but with the cheap price, I guess it's worth coming.   I was very grouchy because I had to wait literally 45 minutes for my food..you know, when you're hungry you want to eat right away..20 mins wait would be reasonable..but 45 minutes? That was too much for me."}
{"text":"I think I have to go three stars. Perhaps having lived in CA has me a bit biased.   1st: The food and price is probably 4 1/2 stars. Very good taste. But they could put a bit more chicken in the Pho. The shaker beef was very tasty, but the quality of the meat could have been a bit better.  2nd: The service. It absolutely stinks. The service is really a one star rating. My wife and I got two dishes for us to share. When I asked if we could have an additional bowl, and plate. The guy just looked away and spoke something in Vietnamese then left.   Was there any check back to see if everything was ok? NO  Could I get a refill on my water? NO  Was there a smiling face in the place? NO"}
{"text":"Came here when I was dying for a cheap and simple bowl of vermicelli in any form and it was a night of surprises.  Our waiter was surly and mildly interested in us being there (he even yelled at one of the people in our party when she asked for something off the menu), and the place itself was borderline dirty.  If you are a stickler for cleanliness and atmosphere, this is not the place for you.  The food is a completely different story - portions are plentiful and the dishes are well-prepared.  It's like going over to a friend's house for some straight up homecooking.  Spring rolls, summer rolls, Spicy Hue Soup, Pho and Bun with Pork came to under $20 with the tip.  The pho was brimming with meat and noodles, and the heap of greenery to accompany the soup was plentiful - they even had shiso and regular mint, which seems to be a rarity at a lot of pho places these days.  And everything was perfectly delicious.  Lemme tell you, for that price and the quality of the dishes, I can deal with a little rudeness and dinginess.  No problem."}
{"text":"So tonight I met up with some of my favorite Yelpers, Dallas G., AMber W., and Clifford W. Amber and Clifford are not related. So after having a couple of bites and a drink, Clifford and I were chatting with Mr. Chu about Asian cuisine. This is making me sound like a douche and food douche right now, so be it. Clifford is Chinese, but partakes in all Asian foods. They are going on and on about Korean, Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese establishments around the valley. Which ones are good and which ones are crap. The white boy asks where Panda Express ranks, and the jukebox stops and I am almost kicked out. Anyway, Johnny suggests Pho Thanh over on 17th Ave and Camelback. So Clifford and I decide the night is young and we're still hungry.   The restaurant is in a strip mall on the North side of Camelback. I'm gonna be honest here, the \"shopping center\" is a bit ghetto and the restaurant a bit hole in the wall-e, but whatevs. We sit down and we were told to order the Mi Bo Kho, essentially Beef Stew for us whites. I got the 73, but Clifford being a little more adventurous goes for the 72, pretty much the same thing, but with tripe and beef tendon. I'm all for trying new things, but I'm glad I didn't. I would have gagged the second either of those things hit my lips. Consistency issues with food is my go to category on Jeopardy.   The food arrives and the portion is really big and smells delicious. Tender chunks of beef, carrots, rice noodles, and a plate of veggies to add. Throw in some bean sprouts, basil, and lime. Awesome! The broth was really good and the meat just fell apart. We ate everything in our bowls and were stuffed. All totaled up was $11!!! Can't beat that.   Again, I am not a connoisseur of Vietnamese food, but this was damn tasty and filling. Brave the ghettoness and give them a shot. Oh, don't expect much conversation from the employees. Witty banter wasn't listed on the menu."}
{"text":"I really dont care how they got 4 stars. But if i can give a negative star i will do it and a couple of times. First of all service is horrible. We order a salty lemonade and  thai tea. After 5 minutes some one comes to the table and just said no more lemonade. So after 5 minutes more we called the waiter and asked about the thai tea. Like they had no clue we order the thai tea. Im from long beach ca. Many good pho restaurants there for me to be able to compare good service and great food. The pho was not the best."}
{"text":"I have been to Pho Thanh on many occasions. Unfortunately the service has not improved. My best advice is to make sure you order and get everything you need on initial contact with the waiter because once the waiter is gone, they're gone. It's next to impossible to get your waiter to come back to your table.  Don't get me wrong. They serve some of the best pho I've ever had but the service has reached a point where I will not drive out of my way to eat there anymore. Not like I have in the past. I can get good pho and much better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"The staff here wear shirts that say \"Eat more Pho\" and I agree.  This place has great food and has now become a weekend religion for my wife and I.  With so many options on the menu I can not pick a favorite, but the egg-rolls are a great starter, any Pho you pick is good, and the Banh Mi's have been great.  Fair warning, do not expect 5,4, or 3 star service, this place is about the food.  A tip for first timers, note your table number (located on the condiment tray) and pay at the counter.  If you don't finish your food there are self serve to go containers by cashier.  \"Eat more Pho\" Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've been to this spot a few times. It is pretty good. Been here this past weekend because a few of us was craving some pho. I ordered the pho with rare beef and meatballs, and also the BBQ pork sandwich. All pretty tasty.  All my other friends ordered pho also and by the looks on their faces they seemed satisfied and it seem to hit the spot for the day. I'd love to give this place 5 stars, but couldn't because they looked pretty busy, but it took awhile for us to just get a refill on some water. It wasn't just us though, it looked like everyone only got one glass of water. Other than that, the food here is good and I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Family owned and good prices and great food.   For appetizers i usually get the spring rolls or fried egg rolls. The fried egg rolls come with lettuce and vegetables that you wrap the egg roll with.   For the main course I recommend the number 14 beef with meatballs pho. I have eaten pho around the valley and this place has by far the best.   My other go to for dinner at times is the 123 shaken beef. This is beef marinated in some kind of sweet sauce that comes out on a sizzling platter. Its totally amazing flavor and comes with rice and a salad."}
{"text":"I live in mesa, and there isn't a shortage of Vietnamese food, but I prefer this place! I LOVE this place. The prices are great for the amount of food! I always get the #11. It is sooo delicious. Customer service is okay, but honestly I come here for the good food. I've never had a bad experience with the food, the service is quite fast also. The Thai tea is my favorite iced beverage."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh is a excellent place to eat pho, the broth is amazing and the portions are way too much! But for other Vietnamese food besides pho, you should head down to Da Vang."}
{"text":"Don't expect great customer service when you come here....but realize that you come here for the amazing authentic food!  Their Pho is always great but also try their chicken curry! This is my go to place for when I'm craving Pho!"}
{"text":"yum.  best pho in phx.  Just don't expect spectacular service, and the restroom could use a scrubbing, everytime I am there, there is never any paper towels to dry hands and it smells like urine.  Good food though!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. Hit the spot. You get a lot for how much you pay. I was truly disappointed on customer service. No hi welcome. I waited for a while to order and no thank you for coming or anything. Very very rude. I guess when the food is good why be nice. I am huge on customer service. I would never dine in but I would do take out just so i do not have to deal with rudeness."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this pho place a few years ago. Had not been back since. I brought my BF and they did not disappoint. I ordered the PHo with chicken and limeade. My boyfriend ordered the beef and coffee. The place was packed and our food came out in record time. When you go in, the counter is for to-go orders and the dining is \"wait to be seated\".  Highly recommend this Pho joint... I was starving and I forgot to take a picture until I was knee deep in enjoyment.  Oh we also had the pork sausage spring rolls...I would pass on that but my BF loved them."}
{"text":"Not very good. Was my first time eating pho and to be quite honest it was a disappointment. People talk about pho like it's the best but here wasn't good. Fried rice was good which is why I gave them 2 stars. Other than that I wouldn't come back. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Came here once and I am in love with their broken rice. Good food for reasonable price. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is not only pho-nomenal but also pho-ntastic. You wont Pho-get this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"We loved both the egg rolls and the spring rolls, especially the yummy sauces. Then we had a delicious salted fish fried rice and vermicelli with pork and shrimp cake in bean curd. If we lives in Phoenix, we'd become regulars!"}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews decided to give this place a try. I ordered the beef broth with seafood. If the two shrimp, one fish ball cut into 8 pieces that were hard as a rock, and three tiny pieces of squid considered a seafood dish than this is for you. Definitely not for me. My daughter ordered the beef broth with all beef fixins. The tendon was so hard they literally must of just thrown it in just to say it was in there. And the spring rolls that are hard to mess up were sooooo greasy. Never coming back here!"}
{"text":"What makes good pho is a flavorful broth, and this place has hands down the best broth I've ever tasted. Along with that the portions were huge and the meat was tender and delicious. But the winner of this pho was the flavorful broth.  Not only that but you can get a bowl for 5 bucks which is what it should cost. But these days most places have the price hikes up to 9 or 10 dollars. But anyways, this place was truly amazing and all though it's quite a drive from my place in Tempe it's well worth it for the amazing pho.  I'll definitely be coming back to this place in the very near future and would highly recommended it."}
{"text":"I got the Beef Pho and spring egg rolls. For a 4pm visit it was pretty busy. But it took about 5mins to get my to go order.  For the Beef Pho, the flavor is in the broth. And half is filling and is good the next day.  Spring egg rolls were good, I didn't care for the peanut sauce - it was thin and not very flavorful. But I found mixing the hot sauce and the peanut sauce made it better.  The place didn't seem so dingy as others have made it out to seem. The two waitors cleaned tables quickly. I saw that people who ate in seemed to given extra time to pursue the menu before being approached.  Somewhere I would be back and look at what other things they have to offer."}
{"text":"I go here when 1) I don't want to cook 2) When I want asian food somewhat healthy and 3) When I don't want to spend more than $7.99   Of course, by deciding to eat at an establishment that does not break the bank or even your piggy bank, you have to give up the following things:  1) the acknowledgement of a friendly \"hi\" or \"welcome\"  2) the ability to easily find parking  3) the feeling of safe and soundness with your car and yourself  4) the feeling of belonging 5) a glass of water or any refills  6) the delivery of your check (you actually have to walk up to the cash register to pay)  7) the friendly \"thank you\" and \"come again\" and last but not least  8) dining experience euphoria  But hey, sometimes for me, it's worth it once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"I'll break this down into a simple pro/con list.   Pros: -inexpensive ($6/bowl for basic pho)  -flavorful broth  -large menu  Cons: -parking is a nightmare -claustrophobic if it's busy inside.  -not very clean (dirty floors/bathroom) -cheap meats (fatty/gristly)  -employees are very disorganized, no one speaks English.   Will I go back? Probably. Is it the best Phoenix has to offer? God I hope not."}
{"text":"I decided to come back because I was craving Hu Tieu Dai dac biet.  I also recommended a few Viet food virgins to this restaurant and they really really enjoyed it.  I came back on a Sunday and I had to wait- this is the first time I have ever had to wait at a Vietnamese restaurant- so that says something about this restaurant.    I heard they will be expanding soon so hopefully next time I come back there won't be such a wait.  Food reviews: Must go for the Hu Tieu Dai Dac Biet!!! I love it! Pho Bun Thit Nuong  I am planning on trying their Pho Ga next."}
{"text":"We tried this place after reading most of the reviews.  I had rice noodle soup w/ fishballs, squid, shrimp & veggies and hubby had shredded pork sandwich.   Both were good and plenty of food.  The pork sandwich was so cheap, it was hard to believe it wasn't a typo.  Beats a Subway anyday!  The neighborhood is a bit shady but if you don't mind that, it is fine.  Service was quick and we will definitely revisit this place.  People kept pouring in during the dinner hours.  Can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef and vegetable dish, its $7, came out fast, hot and delicious.  it looks pretty boring but the taste was awesome.  I scarfed down all the broth too it was great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to get pho. I've grown up with my mom making authentic home made pho so I know what's good and authentic and what's just eh. And I've had my fair share of over priced noodles and broth that simply wasn't pho at all. This was actually my first spot getting pho and I've tried many other places afterwards but this is definitely my favorite. Their broth is very flavorful. I don't even have to put many seasonings on over it besides my chili sauce.   They are always busy here and they have recently remodeled and added more space. I went last week and seen that they are working on expanding the restaurant even bigger. There was a long line but they always do their best to get you in. There is very little communication with the servers so you pretty much have to know what you want and that's about it. The servers never really come back after they drop off your food and that's if they even drop it off because it's usually always the food runner.   No one ever seems to mind their service unlike most restaurants where you would expect more of a communication with your server. I even heard a couple say they were told to stop by Pho Thanh from a \"foodie\" from NY and that the guy always knows great food.   This place is definitely good pho!"}
{"text":"I drive all the way from south scottsdale to come here. Haven't found any other pho that can compare."}
{"text":"Best chicken pho I have ever had in Phoenix. The BROTH is HEAVEN!! So yum. Definitely worth it to try. I've only ordered pick up because I work down the street, but I'm sure it is amazing to dine in. The ambiance isn't great. It's a standard Vietnamese set up. It looks like a cafeteria to be honest.  If you're on the fence about it you have to GO. Best pho around plus it's under $6.00!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place like 8 years ago....and I still love this place! Been to many different Pho Houses.....but this is the one I always come back too! Added bonus is that my daughters live right across the street from them too!! So they enjoy coming here as well!! And the grandkids also.....its a generational affair!! Love the food and the price is just right!! Years ago this place was so small and crowded you would wait outside in line for a table, but since they expanded it a couple of years ago its a lot bigger and more table! They actually added a Boba Drink stand next door! Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"This is my ISH!! 6$ Pho and TRY the firecracker shrimp!!!..If this place served alcohol id never leave."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. I hear great things about Pho Thanh and they are pretty accurate. The pho is great, the option of oxtail is a treat. This place is expanding, so there are plenty of seats. Staff is a little all over the place but that does not take away from the quality of food. Parking lot is a little bit of a cluster too but again, place is pretty worth it."}
{"text":"great food like it is to die for, but they have pretty bad customer service. i still come by for the food."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for a few days.  After a few days of salads and sandwiches I was craving for a hot bowl of noodles.  Pho Thanh satisfied my desire.  The food was decent but they come in much smaller portions than I'm used to seeing.  Overall,  I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Is it?  Can it be?  A Vietnamese spot I like better than Da Vang?  Yes...  Since my Vietnamese food loving friend introduced me to Pho Thanh a few weeks ago (thank you!!), I have already enjoyed multiple visits.  It is that good.  They are open early, too (8:30am!) so it is a good choice for a post-hike late breakfast/early lunch.  A typical visit starts off with the #1 spring rolls.  They are huge - rice paper stuffed with shrimp, pork, lettuce, mint and sprouts and (yay!) served with peanut sauce.    Sometimes a Bahn Mi (sandwich) gets thrown into the mix - fresh soft bread and ample portions of warm pork.    On to the Main Event... Pho.  Their take-out menu states on the front \"The Best Beef Noodle Soup In Town\" - believe it.  They are not kidding.  I am a creature of habit, and always have the #113 - beef noodle soup with filet mignon tenderloin beef.  I like to have the raw beef served on the side, so I can \"cook\" it myself in the hot broth.  I am tempted to ask for extra beef the next time I am there.  I don't know how long I can last until I need to go back."}
{"text":"Cheap food that is great quality. Always busy, but service is fast. Not much to look at from the inside or the outside, but who cares? Pho is delicious. Spring rolls were great. That is all you need to know,"}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for the best Pho place since coming home from Vietnam and this is the best!  The beef Pho is full of flavor and you have all the sauces you need to make it your own.  Spring rolls are fresh and delicious.  Fresh coconuts are a must! Prices are also the best I have seen anywhere!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Good pho, good service and the food comes out quick! Most places my bf and i request double meat, here we had leftovers - so next time we won't even need double. Prices are very good as well! Thai tea tasted like heaven. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years now. I keep coming back because I love Vietnamese food.  The prices here are super reasonable. I mean how can you beat $4.50 for a bowl of pho?  There tons of items on the menu for less than $6.00. Everything on the menu is pretty solid. Is it the best Vietnamese food ever, not even close. But I compare everything here to the wonderful Vietnamese food I had in California. I'm a bit of a pho snob too. Sadly I will be back when I need a pho fix since my options are pretty limited in Phoenix.  The service here leaves much to be desired. Come here for some solid Vietnamese place and don't expect a fancy place with great service and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"Best out in the neighborhood in my view. Well balanced pho broth. I come here several times a week. Best 6 bucks money can buy for lunch!  I get the 114 no tripe."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the #12.  I'd like to try more stuff, but am not familiar enough to know what to order.  But the #12 or #14 are so awesome.  I go at least twice a week...It is what is is;  Vietnamese, clean, and delicious.  You don't have to have formal service and white tableclothes to serve awesome food."}
{"text":"I love their pho dac biet here! It's so good!! I live in Chandler so whenever I head to Phoenix I always have to make a stop here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing authentic tasting! its kinda in a hole in the wall strip mall but always busy so u know it must be good. I always get the same thing and am never disappointed a big bowl of tai pho (beef soup) with beef on the side, crispy eggrolls with dipping sauce, and their Vietnamese coffee. Everything tastes absolutely delicious and is served with fresh mints and greens and condiments! I crave their pho seriously. I never can finish what I get either b/c it is so big!!! Despite the huge portions it only ever costs me $12. What nice too is they are attached to Milk Run if you want to get a flavored drink afterwards for kids or urself."}
{"text":"Well, I should probably start out by saying that I've never had pho before, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but nevertheless... I have never tasted something so delicious! A friend of mine picked up an order of beef pho for me and showed me how to prepare it. The portion was so huge I had to search high and low for a big enough bowl to put it in! Major bonus? It was SUPER cheap!! I just wish the location was closer to me in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall in a strip mall. I love pho and decided to try this place out. The egg rolls were very peppery, but good and the spring rolls were good. I had #12, pho with steak. The pho broth was very good, but the meat was low quality and had lots of gristle. I would probably not go back because the meat really turned me off and was unappetizing. And all the people saying this is the best pho around, it is not, the best pho around,in my opinion is Pholicous on cactus and 75th ave."}
{"text":"I should probably rate this one star so that none of you will come here...it's already packed in here most of the time! Delicious, large portions, cheap, and vegetarian selections on the menu!  Our vegetarian favorites are the tamarind soup (I get it without tofu because I don't like that pre-fried tofu they use) and the vermicelli dish.  Service, when the place is packed, is not super attentive. When the waitstaff is not swamped, they're more attentive...you can always just go up to the front desk by the kitchen and for some reason, that guy knows everything going on or can find out quickly."}
{"text":"My first ever foray into pho.  The place is easy enough to find, though the parking lot is shared with other businesses in the complex, and thus, parking was a little dicey on a Saturday night.  The place has a large interior space with ample seating, and my friend and I were seated quickly.  Their menu has a lot to offer, but the main event is definitely the pho. I ordered simply for my first try, going with basic sliced beef. All the side garnishes were fresh (bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, lime wedges) and there were a few condiments to add (chili paste, sriracha, fish sauce, etc).  The pho was served steaming hot and the broth was complex and delicious. The beef was just okay, it suffered a bit by being on the dry and overcooked side. The noodles were pretty standard. I didn't realize that the pho would come with as much cilantro in it as it did, and being that I'm not a big fan of the stuff, it tended to overwhelm. I tried to pick around it but the damage was mostly done because it was all throughout the bowl. If you're a cilantro lover, you'll be happy. If you're a member of Team Cilantro Haters, not so much.  Their hours are a bit quirky. They technically close at 8:30pm but they still seat people up to 8:15, so be aware.  I may return eventually, or I may hit up another pho/Vietnamese joint if the urge to try more pho strikes. It's a toss up."}
{"text":"The service will always be subpar to what we are used too it's that way in Houston to you have to give up the service for excellent food especially in Vietnamese culture just the way it is"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to Vietnamese restaurants in this area. It's located on the corner of an old strip mall with plenty of parking available. Once inside, the décor includes tiled floors, black chairs, and sticky tables. Foot traffic is consistent throughout the day, and the bustling dynamic makes it a group and family friendly place to be.  The Pho Filet Dac Biet ($6.25) came with filet tenderloin, beef slices, beef brisket, tendon, and tripe. The broth came with complexity, with depth of beefy bone marrow and star anise, followed by emerging notes of onions, herbs, spices and a mix of fresh veggies. I always asked for the beef to come rare on the side. These thicker marbled cuts often came with a better chew with fantastic moisture. It's comfort food with a tasty spoon. I recommend it.  I also prefer the Pho Filet ($5.75) that came with slices of filet mignon tenderloin beef on the side, fresh plate of veggies, and heaping bowl of bone marrow soup. The broth has been consistent on every visit, and comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants, the beef slices captured all the elements I'm looking for in a good bowl of pho.   The Pho Filet Tai Gan ($5.95) and Pho Filet Tai Xach ($5.95) were very good options too. They came with a good amount of beef tendon and tripe, respectively. I wished the tendon and tripe could appear in thicker chunks or slices, but these variations of toppings did provide additional elements to the greasy spoon.  Services were friendly, quick, and efficient. It is one of those no frills places where the thrill is in the comfort of the broth without highway robbery. Overall, I still believe the flavors could be more robust with thicker cuts of meat toppings. I'd be interested coming back to try their Bun Bo Hue."}
{"text":"Yes! Everything I was craving - delicious pho and Thai tea for a cheap price. No frills, hits the spot. We tried to come a few weeks ago but they were on vacation. So glad we came back and tried this place!"}
{"text":"I think its by far the best pho I had in Arizona.  I'm from L.A. and this is the only place that I came by that is comparable."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch! This is more of a laid back restaurant that you can go to for a quick bite. Their food are great and there service are pretty quick. I love the phos (noodle soup) which are great for hangovers. The prices are very low for what you get."}
{"text":"I had the PHO, and it was excellent! There was a lot of meat and noodles. The soup was much better than a lot of other places I've tried, and I'm from San Diego, so I've tried a lot. It is very inexpensive for what you get. I strongly recommend PHO THANH."}
{"text":"Some of the best Vietnamese food in the Valley. Their fried spring rolls are perfectly crisp. Their Pho is fantastic, too. They just expanded the size of their place so my guess is that business is good. :)"}
{"text":"Everyone knows Pho Thanh has the best broth in town. Super affordable. Service is fast (8 times outta 10), workers not terribly friendly or communicative but you won't care. I love the Vietnamese iced coffee, and my girlfriend loves the fresh coconut. The Pho Tai with egg noodle is to die. Please never remodel again like you did last year. We love you Pho Thanh and can't handle when your closed."}
{"text":"I get serious cravings for this place. I want it right now.  I just wish it was closer and I would eat there so much more. We used to go there a lot when I was in school. It is the best pho I have ever had. It is delicious and amazing. I do not know how they do it. It has so many great vegetables inside it, and the broth is so aromatic.  I also left my wallet there one day. I didnt realize it till 800 PM the NEXT day as I was leaving for the AIRPORT! OMG I was freaking out. I called and they were closing. I was so scared I wouldnt be able to get on the plane. I told them my situation and one of the employees stayed in his car till I got there 25 minutes later, after they were closed. He wouldnt even take a tip! I had to throw the money in his car and leave. It was so wonderful of them, and I will never forget it. I was able to get on the plane and it worked out.  I have nothing more to say about this place. It has great food. Its is super cheap. It comes out fast. Its healthy. What more can you want? Go there right now."}
{"text":"My favorite for Vietnamese food! Hmmmm what more can I say.   Well first off the dining are is large and kept clean. Decor is nice and simple. I like that they keep extra utensils (forks, spoons, extra plates and scissors) out for the guests to self serve. I like as little human interaction as possible LOL  The service is straight to the point. They're not going to stand around all day and kiss your ass. I'm sorry but get used to it. Luckily I'm accustomed to it and enjoyed not being bothered sometimes.   We usually order cafe sua da, pennywort drink, pho, com tam with bi and bbq pork chops, the spring roll and eggrolls. The quality of the dishes have never gone down or varied from visit to visit.   The prices here are also the best in Phoenix. You can get a rice dish for under $6 and the banh mi is only $3.50. Three of us went in and only spent about $25 and left with full bellies.   I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone trying Vietnamese food for the first time :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, awesome tasting Phó, never too long to be seated, always served piping hot w/fresh garnishes.. have been coming here for about 6 years now ,I wouldn't change it! It always hits the spot. Especially when feeling sick it makes me feel better! But honestly the wait staff is a little slow at times but decently priced dishes!"}
{"text":"This place has hands down, the BEST pho in all of Maricopa county. Their broth is unbeatable as well as the freshness of their veggies. I have been all over this county looking for the same quality or better. Da Vang right down the street from this place, Noodles Ranch in Scottsdale, and many more. No one compares to this Pho. If you want authenticity, this is the place."}
{"text":"Yelp'd this place because my fav. spot was closed today, 43 EXPRESS, on Thomas n 43rd ave, had the pho and egg rolls it was okay, but the service very poor, had to ask 3 different people just to get a refill on water... I most likely wont come back.."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and gotten the pho with everything both times. Love the pho here, I guess you could say it's... Phonomenal! The broth is super flavorful and the best part is that a huge bowl of pho is under 7 bucks. The pho comes with a dish full of basil, limes, jalapeño, cilantro, and bean sprouts to add to your pho as well. If you want high quality pho for a price you can't beat, stop on by!   The shrimp spring roll here is also very good and they have a yummy peanut sauce to go with it!"}
{"text":"First of all, the spring rolls are huge. Four shrimp across. Their peanut sauce is delicious. I enjoyed these, but unfortunately I didn't order them vegetarian, and the meat detracted from them.  I ordered the Vermicelli bowl with pork and egg roll, and it was a very large portion. The egg rolls were good, but the pork was fatty and pretty unappetizing.  Their Thai tea was too strong. It was too sweet and too dark at the same time. I will have to water it down next time.  The ambiance is pleasant. It took a while to understand if I'm supposed to order, wait to be seated, how to pay, etc.; and the staff was too preoccupied to help a newbie white boy wandering out of his element, but I eventually was served and once seated, the food came quickly.  It's a shame that it's located so close to two other Vietnamese restaurants. I live 30 minutes away from any of them, and Pho Thanh, Maxim or DaVang would all be regular hangouts for me if one was by my house. Luckily I work close to the three, so I'll settle with a lunch at each at least once a month. They all have something better than the other, and I am anxious to try the pho here.  *update* I've been back numerous times, and the food is good, and the value is great. I think the cleanliness is a huge positive. I've upgraded from 2 to 3 stars. It's still not my favorite, and I'd prefer that they had more chicken or tofu dishes, but it deserves 3 of 5."}
{"text":"This definitely takes the cake w pho in the valley, IMO. Took my dad here last Sunday night and ppl were waiting for a table by front door.  If you're seeking a quiet place for ambience, you prob shouldn't come here. It's sort of down-n-dirty but I think it works for them!  Not in the best of neighborhoods either, but don't let that scare you away. There's an Asian massage parlor next door. Do I know if they give happy endings? No, I don't, but you may want to inquire within after you stuff your gullet with steaming pho. Be prepped to get the fuzz called after you bust a move after your body shampoo.  Fresh accoutrement served with your soup and cheap prices!! We had 2 seafood soups, 2 apps, and 2 Diet Cokes. Bill was under $20. My kinda establishment."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever. Well not really forever, but we do like to use that term for a place that has been in your city for and exceptional amount of time.  Though it has changed names from Pho Bang to Pho Thanh, it still serves good pho.  The place has expanded to the space next door and it was updated slightly with the new name and ownership.  Most all entrée items are worth the try and the Pho Tai is most certainly a perfect choice.  The staff that serves and cleans may seem unfriendly or miserable but they will get you what you want.  Get vocal and do not feel intimidated, just do not be rude.  I have never had an issue here but then again don't have to look at the menu to order what I want.  Pho & Viet Coffee on a late Sunday morning is a very traditional thing so give it a shot."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Prices are so low for the amount of food you get. Last time I called in takeout, the vegetables with the phó are fresh and plentiful. Love this place!"}
{"text":"love this place one of the best viet places in town posting on here so everyone knows they're closed from 2/17-3/24 so don't waste a trip if you're craving viet food and you live all the way in glendale at midwestern"}
{"text":"This is not a good Pho at all! Try going down to Chinatown in LA and taste the difference. Plus, service blows!"}
{"text":"Best PHO ever! I cannot express how much I am in love with this restaurant. Great prices and options. When you call ahead of time for take out they are super quick!"}
{"text":"Well cooked noodles . Good flavor in broth . Meats are well cooked. Quality pho place in Phoenix . Def one of my top choices if I'm looking for pho."}
{"text":"This is a place that the food is exquisite and the workers are very friendly. simple restaurant but the taste millionaire :) I love it"}
{"text":"This family runs a great business! For the Phoenix area, they run a very clean, inexpensive, and certainly authentic Vietnamese dining experience. Don't throw them under the bus and compare them to some of the greats in Orange County or San Fran, those places are in a league of their own. :)   Thanh himself, is a young guy, whom you will usually find seating you when you visit the restaurant. His parents do much of the cooking and other work in the restaurant.   Everything that I have tried so far in this place has been great! The Cafe Sua Da is brewed fresh in a cup at your table while you eat your meal, which is nice, as many of these places have begun to serve pre-made Cafe Sua da. If you aren't familiar with what I am speaking of, it's a very strong coffee that is brewed by the cup and then poured over condensed milk, stirred, then poured into a glass of ice and stirred once more. You won't mess with Starbucks after trying this brew. It's simple, strong, and has a nice kick, along with some anti-oxidizing effects. ;)   The simple, but classic Pho Thai, which consists of Rice Noodles, Pho Stock, and Thin slices of beef that are placed in the Pho bowl just as they are served, is flavorful and great for a newcomer to the Vietnamese Cuisine. It is accompanied with the typical plate of condiments, which you can add to your own discretion and liking. The plate includes the following fresh items: Bean Sprouts, Fresh Basil Leaves, Lime, Jalapeno Slices, and Mint Leaves. A good Pho, won't require adding Sriracha or any other sauces to the Pho itself. Don't be a NOOB and do this. Mix your Sriracha or Chili Oil with Hoison Sauce in the little sauce dish at the table and dip your beef in it before eating. If you like onions, order Hanh Dam with your dish. It's sliced onions in rice vinegar, be sure to spice them up with Sriracha when they bring them to your table, and eat them along with the beef or a bite of your Pho, it's a great addition to your meal.   The broken rice dishes that I have tried have been great as well. Broken rice, is simply that, Rice that has been broken in half by a special machine. It really changes the texture of the rice in a good way. The Pork Chop that I had with mine was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It was served with a fried egg, bean curd wrapped shrimp cake, shredded pork skin, and some grilled shrimp. For less than $7.00, its better than one of those secret steak and shrimp meals that you will find in some of the Vegas Casino's, and will fill you up for sure. Be sure to use the fish sauce to drizzle on your meal. Don't smell it, just add a little chili oil, and drizzle it over your dish. I use the whole bowl, it adds so much great flavor to the dish.   The Spring Rolls were the standard with Pork and Shrimp inside, and served with the Peanut Sauce. Be sure to add a little Chili Oil to the sauce before dipping.   The Egg rolls, which will be ordered by most white people were great as well. It's difficult to screw up fried foods. Be sure that you wrap the egg rolls in the lettuce and add some mint leaves to the wrap before dipping in the fish sauce that you hopefully added a little chili oil to.   The Fresh Coconut Water is served proper, in a freshly cracked coconut. You get the whole thing as you should, whereas some of these places around here will just serve you a small glass along with some of the meat from the coconut inside.   They also serve the Vietnamese Sandwiches here, which I recommend. The BBQ Pork is probably the best one, served on a fresh french roll with Cilantro, Carrots, Jalapeno, and Cucumber. For $2.50, you can't beat it. You can actually take these home and throw them in the refrigerator for later.  Thanh himself usually clears and cleans the tables immediately after someone leaves. The service here has always been great, and very quick, considering that the place is usually full everyday at lunch time.  If you are new to Vietnamese Cuisine, I highly recommend Pho Thanh. Be brave, and try new things, you have no idea what you are missing. They don't serve anything odd, and if it didn't taste good, then it wouldn't be on the menu, so don't be so white, and give it a try. You will love it, I promise! :)"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the food they didn't even have AC in there. Like how are you not going to have AC living in Az and eating Pho."}
{"text":"This restaurant does a fantastic job at delivering quality service. Their food is pretty good quality. Both servers I had provided superior customer service. Very out going and interactive. Nice crowd and group of people. I do recommend this restaurant for singles, couples, friends, etc. Will come by again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Recently made the switch here from Da Vang. Very clean and delicious bowl of pho. I prefer the appetizers (Banh Mi, spring rolls, and egg rolls) at Da Vang but the soup, ambiance, and cleanliness is better here. The noodles are slightly more \"al dente\" and the broth is not as greasy as Da Vang. Service is average and waiters seem slightly angry."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh's Restaurant menu shows a hearty variety Vietnamese eats, and their Vietnamese noodle soups Pho top the list. They offer many, many varieties, but in just one size each super reasonably priced and delicious.  My wife and I consider ourselves Pho connoisseurs, addicted to this fabulous warm comfort food from back east.  Being relative newcomers to the Phoenix Area, we have begun our Pho finding adventure of discovering the best the region has to offer.  After hitting a few local joints previously we've discovered how good Pho Thanh is!  The staff is prompt, accommodating, succinct and helpful - not to mention the huge dining area, its cleanliness and appealing environs.  Don't expect fine furniture, creative décor or table linens, as this is a neighborhood soup kitchen, but, til now, our fave for Pho!  My wife's favorite Pho Tái (Slices of rare eye-round steak) was tender and tasty. My all-time favorite, Pho Tái Nam (Slices of rare eye-round steak and well-done brisket) was exquisite with fascinating whiffs of aromas that scintillate ones palate and desire for the homey broth.  Not all Pho Joints are created equal.  Pho Thanh, unlike many other places locally, offers you all the amenities and condiments (other places make you ask for it - if they have it) fully required accoutrements to compliment and perfect the bowls of aromatic decadence. Their servings will include platters full of lime wedges, bean sprouts, jalapenos, fresh cilantro, along with a great table selection of add-ons!  If you're a devout Pho lover, or a novice looking to expand your horizons in the comfort food arena - Pho Thanh is for you.  We highly recommend them, and plan to continue enjoying their fab Viet foods beyond Pho!  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"The #42 is bomb af. My favorite thing to get there. The grilled pork is perfect, so tender and sweet. Egg rolls add a perfect amount of friend crunch and flavor. This place is also good on your wallet for the sizable amount of food you get. Service could be a little more friendly but other than that, it's a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The best pho in Arizona. I have been going here for years with my family. I always get the pho dac biet or hu tieu dac biet and it never fails me. The service isn't the greatest but not shocking because thats just how vietnamese restaurants are ran. You will not get a server asking you any other question aside from your order. They are pretty bad on refilling your water but you can always request it from a server. The fried rice here is a bit on the dry side so I wouldn't recommend but everything else is delicious. Alsooo, where else can you get a huge bowl of pho for 6.75$ anymore."}
{"text":"This is more of a casual dine in restaurant, if you're looking for good Vietnamese food, especially soup! You come in pick a seat and a server comes to you to take your order. Food there is good and very big serving sizes. The prices are also very affordable and I would almost call it cheap. The soup I order was the bun bo hue ( beef noodle soup) for all the spicy lovers :)"}
{"text":"The bún Bo hue was so salty , no flavor at all . The vermicelli with grilled pork was so spicy , told the waiter his reply was the American people eat they don't complain that it is spicy so it's not spicy. I m sorry we don't care about other people ,we were the one that ordered the food and paid for them . We left the food pretty much there , the waiter should have asked us if we want to have a replacement but he didn't care . We will not come back , there was NO customer service there ."}
{"text":"First, let me tell you that I had had their pho and their spring rolls a couple of times now. Yes, their service is HORRIBLE, they throw the menus on the table and do not speak or smile but their food is decent (I am speaking as to flavor only). Today for lunch we were extremely DISGUSTED and disappointed. I looked up their number to make sure they were open and I happened to start reading their reviews although like I said, I 've been there before. One of the reviews said \"the restrooms are disgusting I wonder how their kitchen looks.\" That REALLY stuck with me but we were already committed (it was three of us) so off we go! We ordered the usual. Two bites away from finishing my spring rolls I find a thick black hair threaded into the spring roll! Ewww! The fact that it was deep in there and not just lightly sitting on top made it even worse. My friend says \"that's gross. Want mine? Mine is from a different batch. What're the odds? Like one in one thousand!?\" (they had forgotten his spring rolls so they came 10 minutes after mine). I did not accept his offer. He began eating his very carefully! SURPRISE SURPRISE! Half way into his spring roll he finds a LONG BLACK AND THICK hair. I couldn't believe it. What the ___?! Please see the pictures. It makes me regret EVER eating there. I will never be back. I can forgive ONE hair in the food, fine, it happens but TWO?! IN THE SAME MEAL? SAME SEATING? Clearly they don't give  a crap about cleanliness. I REALLY do wonder what their kitchen looks like. I get up show it to the cashier who i believe is the owner and he takes the spring rolls and takes them back to the kitchen. He comes back and says \"sorry 'bout that. Want me to take one roll off you bill?\" I explained to him that it was 2 different orders so he took 2 off. A restaurant who does not take pride in their cleanliness and sanitary issues does not deserve my business. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Great food, at a low price. Cafeteria style seating which I'm not a huge fan of but overall a great place and would high recommend it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but for a weekday night in the area, the place was packed! The pho was good, if a little oily, and I appreciated that they took us 15 minutes before they closed."}
{"text":"The broth is usually fantastic here. I usually order the 113 and it is delicious. The spring rolls are a little dry but also delicious. The interior is nicer than most hole in the wall dives but comfort is not the main goal. Service is fast. Try the pho. You won't be disappointed in the broth!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for spring rolls on a Saturday night, and was sos surprised at how busy it was. The waitstaff wasn't very helpful in putting in a to-go order and they were also not very polite in saying excuse me or sorry when they repeatedly bumped into me going back and forth to the kitchen (it's tight quarters in the waiting area up front). It also took about 35 minutes, which I felt was pretty long for spring rolls.   The spring rolls were delicious and inexpensive. I didn't like the peanut sauce they included, it was almost like a jelly, very odd.  I would definitely be back. The food outweighed the poor service for sure. I would recommend just dining in."}
{"text":"Been coming to this pho spot for years . Always get a delicious and consistent bowl of pho . Service is never that great but I can get past that for the price and quality of the food . The number eleven and the drip iced coffee are my go to nearly every time. Would definitely recommend ."}
{"text":"This is my second spot for pho, its also good, decent prices, pretty quik service, ok service, slightly bigger that my other spot. Broth is good n portions is good to.! Worth the try!!"}
{"text":"The first time I dined here, I left petrified- the portions were small and the seasoning was barely enjoyable. However, they remodeled and there's definitely a new cook because the place looks way more lively and the food is much better. I like their 3 color dessert (Che Ba mau)."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and am very happy I did. I was very impressed with the variety of options for Pho beef soup. The broth is delicious and chili sauce, crushed chili in oil, and Sriracha are well stocked at every table. They are pretty generous with the fresh basil, sprouts, and jalapeños.  I was sold when I saw the menu online. It definitely looked like the real deal Holyfield. Pho with tendon, tripe, brisket, and all of the fixin's? \"Oh yeah. I'm gonna eat that.\"  The service was good enough for dining alone. They pretty much bring you your food and leave you the heck alone to stuff your face in peace. That might not be ideal for a large group, though. The ambiance is very utilitarian, which I like, actually.  The strong flavorful iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk ended my meal perfectly. I think I've found my regular pho spot."}
{"text":"When I moved here from CA, I sought comfort food, and found pho thanh. This was my go-to place for the past couple of years. In fact, I go here at least once or twice a week.   It used to be good, however, lately their Pho has been disappointing. I'm not sure if it is because of high demand, but their broth has lost its flavor, tasting more like it's diluted with water.   Their service is still lightning fast, despite huge demand. Food is still very affordable. Because of declining quality, I have now migrated to Da Vang, a couple of blocks away, which IMO is superior in taste but comparable in price."}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN PHOENIX... Great customer service. Yummy broth and price awesome $5.95 for a large bowl. Service is quick...Came back multiple times n i will be back again is that good...."}
{"text":"Passing by and wanted Pho. The reviews looked really good and I had to try.  Pho Tai: broth was flavorful and had a small amount of oil which was refreshing. Plenty of noodles to fill me up, but where's the beef?  Goi cuon: it was just ok for me, nothing special and the sauce was bland.  Che ba Mai: I had better.  I can't justify going any higher than three stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 5-stars for its great food, great price (less than $6 for almost all main dishes), and great authentic selections. It's one of the best Vietnamese Restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Broth has so much flavor, good portions for all noddle soup and rice plates, and also have good variety of desserts to choose from.  To me, their service is typical for an Asian restaurant that doesn't overcharge you for good food.  By Western standards, their service is lacking (better if you speak the language).  They do seat you right away even when they are busy, and food comes out fast, but don't expect much more than that.  They do accept all major credit cards.  You can eat a lot for 2 people at this place under $20!"}
{"text":"First I'd like to say the food is pretty good. But probably will never come back here again due to the fact that the service was bad. They have bad attitude towards customers.  they probably say, \"you come for the food not customer service\". Well, yes thats why im writing this review, and probably wont go back cus this place is lacking of customer service. there are many more better restaurants in town."}
{"text":"The food is delicious no doubt , but am giving it 4 stars because of their service. I had to yell and wave my hands just to take my order."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Very busy. Great Pho.  I had the spring rolls and a large combo bowl.   The bowl was packed, more meat in this bowl than any other pho place I've been.  Great flavor. Only draw back, meat had a little more fat on it than I would like.   Great place I'll be back."}
{"text":"I eat the pho here weekly! It is seriously amazing despite the location. It is the best pho I've had in Arizona and am so grateful to have found this gem! On top of the greatness the PRICING is beyond reasonable. This place is a must."}
{"text":"When I'm sick: pho.  When it's cold out: pho.  When mercury is in retrograde: pho.  When I win the lottery: pho.  When the sun rises: pho.  When the sun sets: pho.   May Pho Thanh live long and prosper."}
{"text":"best broken rice anywhere and best price!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends and had some top quality pho.  Their prices and quality of food cannot be beat! I always get number 15 and love the pho. Their egg rolls are also tasty and the sauce they serve it with is amazing! The food is consistent here. I've come here a handful of times before and it always is he same. So hats off to the staff in the back of house!  The service isn't amazing but they get the job done and are often very busy! Be prepared to wait if you go during a peak time of day.  They have Vietnamese iced coffees, Thai tea and coconuts for some unique drinks!  I don't come here often but whenever I do, I know it will be consistent."}
{"text":"when I was in San Jose, I always know where to go for a great Vietnamese food. finally I found another place here when I'm travelling in Phoenix. this place is a local for people looking for a great vietnamese food. can't go wrong if you want an authentic vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Awesome Pho!  One of the best in the valley.  Probably the BEST bang for the buck for Pho."}
{"text":"Tastes really really good.  Spectacular soups! Very fresh quality nutritious  greens.  Huge portions. Nourish your body."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, well priced, challenging parking. I ordered lunch to go and arrived 30 min late.. Food was ready, services was fast & efficient..Food was delicious & piping hot!!;-) What more can you ask for-"}
{"text":"In the mood for Asian, I was searching Yelp for a new place to try.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you get inside there is a large well lit dining area. Nothing fancy but it was homey. They were busy tonight with a mixed crowd of people.   On the advice of the reviews here, I ordered egg rolls instead of spring rolls. I went for the house special pho with beef tenderloin and brisket. And based on a tip in the reviews, tried the broken rice plate with fried pork chop and requested they add a fried egg.   The egg rolls were not good. They were very greasy. They come with lettuce and herbs to wrap and a vinegar sauce for dipping. The flavor wasn't bad but again really greasy. Wouldn't order again.   The two entrees came next. I dove into the pho. It had a good rich broth. It tasted like beef and green onion, with hint of ginger and other flavors I couldn't name. The pieces of beef were tender with just a touch of fattiness for extra richness. It came with the usual side plate of additions. I actually just added some lime, bean sprouts, and green herbs. I didn't add any sauces or anything. It was satisfying. It was good, I would order it again, and I'm not a huge lover of pho.   The fried pork chop plate was delicious. It was my favorite of the evening. It was a large pork chop fried until golden brown with a unique spice coating. It was served on white rice with some pickled vegetables. The pork had good flavor already but I really liked it with a dash of sriracha. Based on the pork chop alone, I'd give them 5 stars but the egg rolls were pretty bad. Dripping with oil. But I'm definitely going back again soon. Pho Thanh has won a new fan."}
{"text":"Bo Luc Lac (Shakin/Sizzling Beef) is a dish not offered by many Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix, and not a dish that is often done as well as these guys make it.  They take cubed morsels of steak and serve it on a super hot cast iron plate, the steak smells amazing as it simmers in an asian style brown sauce at your table. Served with a a salad of lettuce, tomato, and crispy onions with a vinegar dressing; and a large bowl of rice."}
{"text":"I'm a pho-natic. It's true. I have an issue. I have turned my back on my Mexican roots and taken on pho as my new hangover cure, illness comfort, and I'm poor and starving meal, over menudo. What's great about it is that it's available every day of the week. Unlike menudo when Saturdays and Sundays are it.   I do like pho thanh but I don't feel that the meat is as high quality as some other places I've had pho. But it's well enough. The service is equally as terrible as Da Vang which is another place I like to get pho. I don't know. Sometimes there are flies all around my fixings. I don't like that. Sometimes the servers seem disgruntled that I want to come in and eat. I don't think I have ever done anything to them... Sheesh. Anywho, I like the location as it's pretty close to my house. I like that I can order a Thai tea with my hot bowl of awesomeness. I like that it is next to a nail supply store, which can get dangerous.   Hmmmm, over all I have to say that I patronize this place because it is close, inexpensive, and relatively good pho."}
{"text":"Been going here for 3 years every Sunday with my family. They closed due to a holiday so I'm in need of my fix. Not much to say, the other reviews speak for itself. They are the best!"}
{"text":"After trying another nearby Vietnamese place, I decided to check out something slightly closer to where I live. I love Pho. Period. The other two places I went didn't quite have the quality I've experienced at Pho Thanh. The Pho I've ordered here have just been a tad more consistent than the alternatives. I also enjoy the environment slightly better than the others. It seems more welcoming. Plus, I'm used to it now after several trips here.  Pho is also a great meal after a drink or two in a local pub. Always filling and cheap. I took a girl who I work with here and now we've been spending more time together. Coincidence? I think not.   Thanks Pho Thanh!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing! cheap prices, great food, laid back atmosphere. Try the steamed chicken pho, broken rice with pork chop, and the coconut drink!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pho place in Phoenix.  Not a fancy place, but they put their focus where it counts...the food.  I've had several of the pho dishes including the ox tail which are all super tasty.  I'll  definitely be back regularly."}
{"text":"The pho here is good, affordable and consistent. I also have had the banh xeo  & the egg rolls here which are very crisp and tasty.  The drawbacks to this restaurant is that they do close early (very common for most Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix) and the location is not too convenient to Tempe, yet the price and quality is worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the typical Pho restaurants in California. Not decorated, simple seating with simple menus and service. With that being said and since I am myself Vietnamese, I love this place. It's very much a Vietnamese restaurant, they even have some menu options you find at any other Vietnamese place in Phoenix. The food here is incredible. I've had the Pho, rice porridge, Banh Xeo, spring rolls, and more. I love it here and you can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"The best Pho in town. I came here once and it changed my life! Thank you for all the great food and quick service!"}
{"text":"Was visiting PHX on a trip to grand canyon. This is your 'authentic' pho place, not the American Pho place. Portions are huge, price is cheap, environment is dirty, and noisy AF. You pay at the counter after meal. You know what i am talking about."}
{"text":"Best Bahn Mi in Phoenix.  Huge portions.  The real deal.  Extra parking in back and next to Asian market. You can order by number at counter for to go and walk around the Asian market till your food is done."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho places. The portions are large and easy to take home for later.  They are not stingy at with the add ins. My only complaint is the odd hours. They are closed around dinner time. I have shown up a few times and they have been closed which was really disappointing because this restaurant is across town for me and by that time I was starving. I just call before hand now."}
{"text":"Always a fan favorite!!! I usually have the Pho ga but today I tried the filet mignon. The broth was flavor and hot! The beef was tender. The regular bowl is a huge portion !! You will definitely leave feeling full. We also had the fried egg rolls which came with a tasty dippin sauce in orders of 2. It was pretty busy and in disarray as it was Mother's Day afternoon. People seemed happy to wait"}
{"text":"Quick, Easy, amazingly priced food. Quality of food and the service is what keeps me coming every single week! Love this place!"}
{"text":"After living in san francisco for some time ihad the pleasure of having some amazing Vietnamese restaurants right in my backyard. Craving pho one day while living here in az i came across pho tranh. Skeptical of not finding food on the same par as san francisco me girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. Based solely for the food since the customer service was a bit ho hum. Id say you cant go wrong here with the pho. Definitely worth your time."}
{"text":"Damn good. Is it the best Pho in the world? Probably not. However, it is still really good and really cheap. It's a little difficult to get a refill on your water from time to time but they are always crazy packed. Even with the craziness your food still comes out really quickly. Parking can be a little crazy in the front but I just discovered you can park in the back.   But what's there not to love. Really good food. Really cheap prices. Really speedy service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It is very large and a little confusing on if you should sit down or order at the counter but we were eventually directed to grab a table and someone came to take our order. I ordered a chicken and seafood pho and my boyfriend ordered the beef. We split fresh spring rolls and really enjoyed everything we ordered. You get a lot of food for the money and the food comes out freaky fast. We have found some better pho places in the area but would still come back here for a bite"}
{"text":"So this place was pretty good. The best I've had in AZ. I'm from Southern Cali so I'm used to the best Pho. Great prices ! The only thing is it's in the worst part of town (but hey usually that's whr the best food is ) very sketchy lol but I highly recommend this place. Btw there closed on Tuesdays. I drove dwn last tues and I was very disappointed. Who closes on a Tuesday??! :-/"}
{"text":"Went here with the hubby last night for the first time with the Yelp International Supper Club. I had a great time meeting some fellow Yelpers and getting to try out a new place. I had seen this restaurant on Check Please! on PBS so it was already on my super-long and always growing \"to try\" bookmark list.   We started with spring rolls which tasted super fresh and delicious. They were the non-fried kind and there is nothing worse than when those get a little old and the rice paper starts to get crunchy instead of chewy. But these were perfect and came with a yummy dipping sauce. Also, there were huge whole shrimps in them instead of chopped or minced as some Asian restaurants use. The hubby got a beef noodle dish and I ordered Pho. Both were very tasty. I liked the fact that they gave you ample amounts of (very fresh) herbs and condiments to add to the soup to your liking. It reminded me of eating menudo at my MIL's house. I was also very happy to see that they included sliced jalapenos on the garnish plate... even though I didn't eat them outright as did some others at the table, I added them to the broth and let them steep a bit and it gave the perfect amount of spice to the pho. The bowl was so huge that I couldn't finish it all but it was really good and left me with a satisfied but not too stuffed feeling.   Since we got there late, I had ordered hurriedly so I was very surprised when I went up to pay and both our meals including tax and tip was still less than $10. Amazing! I seriously can not remember the last time I paid so little for a good meal. I pretty much never come to this part of town but if it was closer to where we live I would definitely make this place part of our regular rotation.  The staff was friendly and accommodating as well.  The only thing they would need for a fifth star is a nicer location/ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnams restaurant, I've been eating here for over 10-yrs and seen such growth. The food is affordable, tasty, and the service well okay. I would recommend this particular Vietnams restaurant out of all the rest I've visited."}
{"text":"No frills, good broth and noodles type of Vietnamese restaurant. It's nothing fancy, but the pho is amazing. The noodles are good and the broth is perfect. They give you lots of bean sprouts to put in and a good amount of beef (if you choose the beef pho). For $5, you just can't beat this restaurant. It's really just that good. I've tried the bahn mis, broken rice, buns - all the food is pretty good but their pho really stands out."}
{"text":"One word. FIRE! As in legit and amazingly good. Yes the Pho, but I don't do Pho. I go big. I was eating Pho in 5th grade while you were slurping up spaghetti Os from your moms Astro Van. Go for the good stuff. #42 or #59. This is the highest quality, most authentic and best pricedVietnamese restaurant I've been to. Menu is extensive as well. I took my boy drizzy drake and uncle June bug here after their concert last month. Drizzy is mean on the recorder, way better than the other 8 year olds. I think he has a future. I digress. If you broke take the light rail, if you a BOSS like me, take your 06, get in the street sweeper, bump some hot cross buns and get your passport stamped in Nam. Chuch."}
{"text":"Dan Vang....go there. Since remodel prices went up quality down. ! Phoned Dan vang wenesday they were closed. So we phoned ordered first huge price increase second order was incorrect and not the quality or worth the extra price I payed cheap on vegitables . Very disapointed! Will never go back!"}
{"text":"The yummiest pho ever! I Always order the beef and brisket pho, spring rolls, and soda chanh.  You have to be quick, get in order your pho and scram.  Place gets pretty busy but very worth it."}
{"text":"Spot on pho than and spring rolls every time! It's quick, very inexpensive, but is not lacking in flavor.   Boyfriend and I have tried other things here as well and we haven't been disappointed.   On average, your wait time for getting food is about 5 minutes after you walk in the front door. :)"}
{"text":"EDIT #2: I was there not too long ago and this place fell from grace. My former favorite dish, the bun bo hue was horrendous. The meat in it was so tough, I swear I was eating those leather tabs that is sometimes attached to new shoes. All I could do was just chew it enough to get the meat flavor out of it and then spit it out.   I'm in Tucson now, but the next time I\"m in PHX, I'll definitely have to find another pho place."}
{"text":"Pho is great.  This Pho is great.  The veggies Pho is top notch.  I get soup about once a week and always have to get more for everyone I work with.  The price is good and the place is always busy which is a good sign it will not be closing down anytime soon.    If you are not a big fan of the veggie try the meatball because that is good to.    I believe it is better then Maxim.  But try both and compare for yourself because Pho is good."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly one day and seriously fell in love! This is a hidden treasure and they take their craft very serious. I am Vietnamese and I have to say, the food is fantastic! It appears to be an amazing mom and pop shop with authentic quality! I would definitely love to come here again. Their service is great and they're consistent for being very busy. I got their speciality pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, hot tea and a coconut. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"The pho was good and well prices  Broth was excellent, service was good, I'm a frequent flyer when It comes to this stuff"}
{"text":"Extremely exceptional service here, I walked in and was immediately seated and my order was taken within the first two minutes of being here. The food is amazing I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"When I'm sick, I get Pho Tai and add a lot of spice! Knocks it right out of me, and for only $5..ummm yeah!  I love this place, with such a great variety of choices, it can be a bit overwhelming.  It's Vietnamese and made to serve the Asian community.  Don't expect it to be in any way to be suited for american taste buds.  Those with an international taste buds will appreciate the flavors of the entrees.   Cheaper than some fast food joints and with veggies served on the side who can pass up a bowl of Pho or Bun for under $10!"}
{"text":"I'm from bay area, so i do have high expectations for vietnamese food. I went here because of high review, so i did have some expectAtion for this restaurant. I went there couple times to try different food: pho, bun rieu, banh canh, and other soup based food. I am disappointed with the quality of the food and the price. The price is almost the same as the one in bay area (San Jose, ca). The restaurant in SAn jose has bigger portion, better quality, more meats, more veggies in a pho and bun rieu. I can never finish the food. This restaurant is only $2-$3 cheaper and the portion is smaller than in bay area. Also, the meat is only 1 or 2 small slices. the quality is nothing compared to the vietnamese food in SJ.  I feel like the food is geared towards american taste instead of the authentic vietnamese food taste. The soup is bland.  If u can cook vietnamese food, better cook it urself at home. Last time i ordered bun rieu, i only found 2 small piece of shrimps, 2 thin slices of meat, some veggies, and several tomato slices in the soup."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype about is surrounding this place. Ordered some pho tai to go and they not only forgot about my order... But put the meat in the broth. By the time I got home it was severely over cooked and tough to chew. If you're looking for a good hole in the wall place go a few streets down to da vang you won't regret it."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure!! Don't be discouraged by their location or store front this place is PHO-mazing!!! I frequent here 2xs a week and have introduced a handful of new loyal customers. I typically get #113 and a Vietnamese drip coffee every time I come I love the pho even more! 5stars from me!"}
{"text":"This is a weekly stop for me if I have any thing to say about it!  This is the second place I have ever had Pho, the first was great and I was happy to find this place in Phoenix.  It has since turned me into a discerning Pho critic.  I klike this place.  Service is cold, but consistent, food is great.  Newbies may want to stick to the basics, but get away from the pho and springrolls and it is great."}
{"text":"Totally bummed .. was craving good pho . Saw good reviews on here ! Ordered through postmates the beef pho and it came , pretty sure it was still moving when it arrived . I know sometimes it arrives a little raw to cook in the broth but this was just not going to do any cooking unless I threw it on the grill or back in the oven . But by the point of it being sitting out for at least an hour I figured the chances of food poisoning were way to high .  It definitely should have been cooked more for pick up !"}
{"text":"This place is a great find.  Right In my neighborhood I walked to it tonite and I'm telling ya I had a meal that was awesome.  Appetizers are huge and delicious. The place couldn't be more reasonably priced than they already are! I recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I come at LEAST 3 to 4 times a month when im in town. The service is straight to the point, speaking of pointing, your better off doing that on the items youd like on the menu. Theres a definite language barrier, respect it, dont get annoyed.          My usual: the #4 to start, diced filet wrapped in tasty lil grape leaves and served over a bed if hot rice noodles. (Lettuce, pickled onion, cilantro, mint, basil should also come out with the order) and the #13 Beef Pho (add veggies) BOOOOOOM!"}
{"text":"Prices are great and the food is delicious. One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Try the broken rice. A great little Vietnamese spot in a truly Vietnamese plaza a few steps away from an Asian grocery store. For under $7 you can enjoy a generously portioned meal and leave happy. I always get the 3 out of 5 visits i stick with the #64 Pork Chop."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, so if you go prepare to wait a few mins for a table.  The staff is fast efficient and to the point, do not expect a lot of hand holding or small talk, know what you want and order.  The food is always great, we have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"We love this place for the best Pho in town , staff on the other hand could be more friendly, simple : hello and thank you are rarely heard. It's a quick meal place , don't expect anything more than that."}
{"text":"Food is delicious ! And inexpensive! Which I love. Thai food is super good but expensive so coming to a Vietnamese restaurant paying half of what I pay is great and you get full."}
{"text":"So this was our first time here tonight. The food is a solid 4 stars. The customer service however is a different matter. Young thug wannabes as servers complete with neck tattoos and \"i don't care\" attitudes. My wife ordered the beef Pho and was well pleased with all aspects of the tasty soup and lean beef. Plenty of garnish choices made for a nice meal for her. I ordered the #80 clay pot catfish. Again, taste wise, it was really good. Portion size however, was very small. Two pieces of catfish (not filet), some broth and a couple of stalks of green onion. After removing skin and bones, there actually was very little fish there. We ordered an additional catfish dish to take home to my son. When we got home, there were two half portions of rice in the bag. Nothing else. We went back and while they did apologize, the reason was \"we are busy\". Uh, yeah. Even though the food is quite tasty, the small portions, lack of customer service and \"I don't care attitude\" translates to WE WON'T BE BACK."}
{"text":"Pho is really good here, they definitely have it down. Sometimes the waiters seem rude but I'm sure it's because they're ridiculously busy all the time plus the language barrier."}
{"text":"Best Ph in town! Other dishes are as tasty. It offers many comfort dishes for me, besides mom's kitchen. Yay!"}
{"text":"Come here at least twice a week! Amazing pho at an amazing price! My faves are #121 (vegetarian pho with tofu & lots of veggies) also the Bo Luc Lac is amaze!!! Its sizzling sautéed tender beef with rice and salad. Egg crepe and spring rolls are the usual appetizers. Food is always perfect! Try the fresh whole young coconut too!"}
{"text":"Pho is good, eggrolls ok nothing to brag about but enjoy the authentic dessert.  The WORST service ever.  Can't get waiter attention to come and wait on us or come back to see how we are doing. This is customer service 101 which they have none.  No customer service whatsoever.  They actually act like your bugging them."}
{"text":"Pho made Photastic. Number one, they are authentic and taste is spot on. I always stick to the classic beef or chicken pho with a shrimp spring roll. I look forward to one day going out of the boundaries because their menu is so rich in traditional meals however today, this review is to give kudos to their although not fancy setting but non the less amazing food where the price doesn't come close to the value. Come here, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Deceiving from the outside but great food inside. Service is okay... Not overly nice but not rude either. We got number 63 and number 141. Both of them were really good. Huge quantities. And very tasty. The food was really fresh and the prices were reasonable. Not a place to go for date night but a good spot to get some good Vietnamese food. Oh and don't visit the bathroom."}
{"text":"The prices are unbeatable. The menu is extensive. My husband loves beef so this was the perfect place for him. Unfortunately, this restaurant is not vegetarian or pescetarian friendly so I will not be returning for myself, but I will pick up take out for the hubby."}
{"text":"Great, authentic pho. Don't go for the service. They treat you like cattle but it's delicious and inexpensive."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Pho. It's always so fresh and delicious. They put just the right amount of everything to enjoy it. The broth is not bland and not too salty.   The only reason why they didn't get 4 stars is because they are lacking in the service department. I've had to ask numerous times for things which were forgotten. And they take forever to bring out your food.  I literally had to chase someone down to order Thai tea and that took 10 mins to come out.   They need more servers and then they would be better."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the number 15 with sliced beef and beef brisket couple of jalapenos in the rest of the veggies thrown in there and man was that good. It comes in a big bowl filled with the delicious stuff and my only complaint is that the bowl could be bigger"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good bowl of pho in Central Phoenix, look no further.  We eat here several times a month and the entire family just can't get enough of the pho, even my extremely picky children.  That being said the shaken beef is a lovely sizzling platter of beef and onions with a nice salad and the broken rice is a fun adventure too. The spring rolls leave a bit to be desired but they're not bad.   The only warning I'd give is don't expect amazingly friendly customer service.  The goal here is to get people in and get them food.  Don't drag your feet on placing your order or it might be a while till they come back.  However, once your order has been placed expect your food to be out in short order.    Overall I'd definitely say it's worth the trip for yummy food at a great price!"}
{"text":"It was PHO-licious...  just like I remember.  Jammed packed and they crank these out.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Vietnamese in the valley. Ever since I moved to Scottsdale from downtown Phoenix, I've been on a mission to find Vietnamese that compares. Nothing has Pho Thanh beat. I'm a regular there, and when I arrive, they know what I'm ordering. This is both sad and great!! I think I need a life outside Vietnamese food! In true Vietnamese service style, there are no frills. Don't come here expecting to be doted upon. Not going to happen. Go here because you want plentiful, cheap, flavorful, authentic Vietnamese food. The spring rolls are the best in the valley by far. I literally have tried 7 different Vietnamese restaurants, and I am starting to lose hope I'll find one close to home! I recommend the steamed chicken pho, spring rolls, and their great coconut water drink. It arrives in a full coconut with the top chopped off, and a straw! Great stuff. Just don't go on a Tuesday, they're closed!"}
{"text":"Pho is one of the best I've had in Phoenix. Egg rolls and spring rolls were good, nothing spectacular tho. The lettuce and herbs served with the pho and egg rolls were really fresh, something I look for in a good Vietnamese place. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I looooooooove thier pho!!! this place is always swinging.  I don't think I have every stopped by without nearly every table being full.   And for good reason, that pho!  Everything looks great, and smells wonderful, but I tend to stick to this awesome soup and spring rolls or a banh mi!   The parking can be a bit of  a hassle, this could actually be the worst parking lot in Phoenix, but it is worth it. And you know what they always get my togo order right, which is a nice plus."}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally went today to try the pho and all I can say is....  PHOenominal!! Very very good and definitely one of my favorite places in Phoenix now."}
{"text":"One of the better Pho places in Phoenix. It's cheap, the food is consistently good, and it is fast. My husband and I love getting pho, vermicelli, and their sandwiches. Between the two of us we end up spending no more than $15 (w/tax) and we are full! Great place to get your pho fix.  Don't expect top notch service or a smile, then you won't be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place! Their pho was mediocre at best, the meat quality was just not good but the broth was good.  Their Banh Cuon was REALLY good though, came out warm and satisfied us to the last bite.  They have a big variety of Vietnamese food here from pho to banh mi to vermicelli to vegetarian.  The next time we will come back will probably be with our parents."}
{"text":"I have tried pho before and i was not a big fan of it. Came here and tried it and i swear it is amazing! I keep coming here for the pho. Their fried rice is pretty great too and their spring rolls are delicious!! When you come in the seat u but if u wanna seat urself somewhere else they dont mind. Everyone here is very quiet but its normal to me lol they are still very friendly. I will keep coming here for my daily pho fix lol."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. The spring rolls and  combination pho were delicious! The pho had just the perfect amount of meat. I don't think I've ever spent just $8 on such a great meal."}
{"text":"Come here once every week or two for the bun bo hue and Thai tea"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite pho spots in Arizona. I get the nem nuong goi cuon and fresh spring rolls as an appetizer, pho tai, and bun thit nuong with cha gio. The total was about $21. The nem nuong goi cuon is alright. The bun thit nuong and pho tai is to die for! The grilled pork in the bun thit nuong is so tender and seasoned just right. The broth in the pho is delicious and the noodles are soft. What I like about the noodles is that they don't stick together like other pho spots. This place does not disappoint!  I wish I lived closer to this area because it's my favorite! Milk run is also next door so after pho, go grab some boba or ice cream!"}
{"text":"I have made this a religious must have go to place for chicken PHO also known on the menu as PHO GA. I ve had  my share of PHo at a variety of places and this place keeps bringing me back every week sometimes twice a week!  It can get pretty packed and the parking can be a hassle but it's worth the less than 2-3 min wait :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for vietnamese food. The pho is the best in the phoenix area and prices are so reasonable, in fact, they're downright cheap! I am Vietnamese and this restaurant has my stamp of approval for authenic, cheap, good food.  The service is the vietnamese norm. Someone will take your drink and food order and then bring you your food. If you need something, you need to speak up. They will not come by and ask how everything is. This is the STANDARD and NORMAL Vietnamese service."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for my second visit. My first was several months ago and I'd tried a Saigon Crepe for the first time which I'd enjoyed.  Today's visit I was less impressed. I had the pho dac biet. Pho with rare beef, brisket, tripe, meatball.  I didn't love it. The broth was lacking in flavor even after adding soy sauce Hoisen sauce, sriracha and the fresh veggies.  My BFF raves about thus place but I'll stick to the places I love."}
{"text":"This place is awesome....best Pho I have found in the Valley. Very affordable....treated 3 of my friends to lunch here recently...we ordered appetizers(try the Fake Pork rolls) main courses, and drinks...and the grand total for 4 people was only $34!! This place is hidden gem."}
{"text":"I swear this place is so Freakin great. Im telling you to come here and get the Pho.  Stop wasting time and eat eat eat"}
{"text":"Okay, if you are still not convinced to try this place you should know that I have eaten here twice in the last week and I sit here now contemplating whether or not to make it a third.  The service is fast and efficient. The food is delicious and the price for the value cannot be beat. I am in love with the Pho at this place."}
{"text":"I only come to Phoenix once a year for a weekend, and I make sure to eat at Pho Thanh at least twice. Great food, even better prices, and I always enjoy my visit. Great to see that they expanded their seating last year to better accommodate diners."}
{"text":"Pho is basically a cure all for me.  When I feel bad, I eat pho to feel better.  When I feel good, I eat Pho to celebrate.  I love it.  So the night after my best friends bachelor party, I was in need of some serious physical rejuvenation the likes of which only Pho can provide.    My quest for my Vietnamese medicine lead me to Pho Thanh and I was struck mostly by its mediocrity.  The soup certainly wasn't terrible, but it lacked that certain quality that elevates Pho above mere food into the realm of the sublime.  The broth was decent but not spectacular, the noodles were good and the meat was alright but the vegetable accompaniments were sadly disappointing.  The herbs were old and wilted and I got a meager ration of both herbs and Bean Sprouts.  I did feel better after my soup, but I left feeling like I did not fully satisfy my Pho craving."}
{"text":"Busy restuarnt, Pho is fine, nothing like what I have had on east coast but will try again .Their sandwiches are highly recommended as well as their rolls."}
{"text":"No frills here. They come take your order, it comes fast, it's cheap, not much of an atmosphere. Try the snowpeas and chicken -  it is a nicely crafted dish when they actually stir fry it, the other day they deep fried the chicken and it was awful!"}
{"text":"Affordable prices :) love this place.. The owner of this place has expanded the restaurant which was a great idea since they are always busy.. The parking lot is small but there is parking in the back.. This place gets busy but their food is good .."}
{"text":"So, I've only been here once thus far, but I'm so glad I came.  First impressions are good.  The focus here is certainly on the food.  Similar to Mi Maxim, the decor is minimal; the restaurant is setup to be functional, more like an eatery than a restaurant.  Which I don't mind _at all_ when the food is good and affordable.  Check and check.  I tried a dish unfamiliar to me: Canh Chua Chay.  It was delicious.  I loved the abundance of veggies.  Add some soy sauce and chili paste...mmmmm!  The spring rolls (vegetarian) where a little dry, but not bad.  Service was all right.  The server was prompt to ask if we were ready to order...like 1-2 minutes prompt.  We needed more time and he was more timely in his return.  We later asked for water and were provided with a big pitcher (a giant, blue, plastic mason jar to be specific).  Afterwards, we really didn't see him.  We did end up getting his attention to find out that we just pay at the counter, using our table number (posted on the edge of the table; 6A for us).  Seeing as this place is only a mile from my front door, I hope to walk over sometime when the asphalt isn't molten anymore and dine again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho.  Tasty broth, nice relaxed casual atmosphere.  The Vietnamese coffee is really strong and refreshing."}
{"text":"Always good, fast service, quality food, large servings, friendly service. We have become regular customers to this restaurant with the best pho in town!"}
{"text":"We ate here on Friday night.  The food was good, but our server and the location sucks ass.  As soon as we pulled into the parking lot (we got the last parking spot in the whole lot) we were accosted by some cracked out, black dude looking for a couple of bucks.  We told him we had ONE dollar and he looked annoyed that we didn't have more.  I scrounged around in my purse for the dollar as he peppered my husband (who was halfway in the car unbuckling the baby from her carseat) with questions about if we also had some change we could give him too, my husband repeatedly said NO we had ONE dollar.  After I slipped the dollar to my husband he offered it to Mr. Crack Head who promptly snatched it up and started across the parking lot to hit up the other people pulling in, and my husband was so pissed that he didn't even have the decency to say \"thanks\" that he started yelling after him about learning some manners.  Ugh!!   Anyway, we get inside and I have half a mind to complain to the restaurant management that they have someone outside harassing all their patrons, but the cold stare from the less than friendly server we had, a young Vietnamese dude with a neck tattoo, dissuaded me from attempting anything more than giving him my order number.  I can understand that a young man in his mid-twenties (?) probably doesn't want to be working tables in (presumably) his family's restaurant at 7:30 on a Friday night, and I can even imagine that maybe, just maybe, his English isn't that good (but I kinda doubt it, he was probably born and raised in the US, unlike the older man at the register), but I simply can't understand why he couldn't fake a smile for us and make us feel slightly less like annoyances, and more like valued guests here to spend their hard cash and enjoy dinner??       Okay rant over, sorry.  So we both ordered the beef Pho with brisket and the food arrived within a blazingly fast 5 minutes.  The soup was hot, hearty and delicious!  No complaints there.  At the same time we ordered the food we each also ordered the sweet young, whole coconut for drinks and, unfortunately, it took another 10 minutes for the coconuts to arrive.  But when they did arrive they were delicious.  We were never checked on after we had our food and our drinks were dropped off at our table, but I guess that's okay since we didn't need anything else and we were able to make due without our server's cold stare and indifferent attitude.    Anyway, the food is fast, cheap and delicious.  The bill was only $16 for Pho and coconut drinks for 2 adults.  You can't beat that price with a stick.   Minus a star for the awful location.  Minus a star for the crappy server.  Aside from that the food is worth braving the location and service.   I think that if the management could tell 'Neck Tattoo' to smile and pretend to be friendly, and to check on the guests at least once, it'd do A LOT to help with the customer service perception.   Oh, and maybe also invest in a security guard to chase the panhandling, crack head out of the parking lot too...  ;)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. I usually get the pho beef or chicken. The order is really large and for the price it's a good deal. You have to also try the grilled pork banh mi sandwich. Don't ask questions, just thank me later."}
{"text":"One of the best broths I've ever had. Definitely a hole in the wall type feel. It always seems to be busy, especially around lunch. I highly recommend this place, seeing that I have tried other pho places around town. This place is for sure my top 5."}
{"text":"This is a busy restaurant and parking totally sucks at lunch. Small parking lot and fights for slots. Inside it's loud - think cafeteria level - and tables all over the place.  Service was quick to get seated and order. Beef pho seems to be the house specialty. I got the chicken and a friend got the beef. While it was good, I'd have to say the broth I've gotten at Song Lynn in Avondale was much better. This broth was sort of flat. I found myself adding more jalepenos and even chilis to give it flavor.  The limeaide was a refreshing choice, but wish they'd give refills.   Overall, a decent pho place but not one I'd go out of my way to return to try.  Pho was in the $6-7 range.  The guy pushing the bus cart reminded me of a cafeteria again. Yeah it cleans the tables quicker, but looks so nasty!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because of the reviews. It was good, nothing to get excited about. I ordered a #11 that supposedly had all the meats in it(tripe, brisket, meat balls, tendon etc). After eating through my noodles I came to realize only brisket and tendon was in my soup. Very disappointed that they still charged me the #11 price when this was obviously not what I ordered."}
{"text":"100% Hands Down Best Pho In Town!   #12, beef on the side, and #3 all day, baby!   I go here at least once a week, some times like 4 time a week, and it's always awesome. Efficient, not super friendly service with consistent legit food. Can't beat it, especially not at this price point! Just wish the place was a little less busy like the good ol' days..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about all the high ratings. When we walked in, it was a little confusing as to where to sit or what to do next.  Someone did come over and grab us and directed us to picnic style sitting where you could possibly be sitting with another group of people.  I don't mind this at all as it's very functional for sitting the most people in as you can in restaurant space.  We ordered the egg omelette and it was quite good.   My husband and I enjoyed it very much but that seemed to be the only thing we enjoyed.  The Pho was lacking in flavor and extremely greasy.  It looked like an oil spill happened in my bowl.  We came here for Pho, and we won't be back for Pho.  We went back to frequenting Da Vang's where I've never had a bad bowl."}
{"text":"Great for Pho. Best place in town, truly authentic. Reasonably priced, and delicious every time!"}
{"text":"Oh..MY...GOSH... Count me in for another five star review!!  This place is awesome.  First off,  from the appetizer section of the menu, the most amazing crepe I have ever had, stuffed with bean sprouts, pork and shrimp.  It is so very good.   The food is amazingly fresh, very large portions and low priced.  They give you a whole bushel of fresh cilantro, mint, basil, etc with pretty much every order.  Fresh and delicious.  An amazing gem for phoenix."}
{"text":"A very good place for Pho. Great tasting soup, fast service, and a huge menu. All the things you'd expect from an excellent Pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pho in town. Don't come for the service, but don't leave without eating the cha gio (egg rolls). So worth the incredibly low prices!"}
{"text":"So after a grilling state exam I was looking for a bit of relaxation. Pho happens to be a great way to unwind. Large bowls of steaming broth that you add a bit of this and that to until you have the perfect potion to make the day melt away. So I did a search to see what was around and came to this place. When I pulled up I was a bit concerned the shabby appearance does not instill confidence. But I've always been one for adventure so I carried on. The inside of the restaurant is clean, well lit and just what a pho place should be. The staff is the same, they are direct and to the point. Setting down our waters and asking \"what you want\" I don't mind this abruptness when the food is good. I ordered summer rolls and pho with rare beef and brisket. And that is when the disappointment started. The peanut sauce was watery and lacking, the rolls them selves where at best ok. The pork inside of them was tough and unseasoned. The pho was good, better then ok but nothing to write home about.  It was a little sad this place has the right stuff for a hole in the wall gem but could not deliver when it came to food. I won't be in a rush to go back, way to many other places to explore first!"}
{"text":"First and foremost let me start by saying this is the most disgusting place for a pho restaurant. How they even have high stars is beyond my belief. I had the pho dac biet and my fiance had bun mam. Oh and we ordered the deli sandwich but got something else. Just terrible. The pho I ordered special pho. Not so special. Broth was not at all hardy as beef broth should be. Instead it was quite sweet. You know what that means. Lots of msg. Siracha and lime couldn't save this poor bowl.  The fiance's bun mam was salty as hell. I had as a server to get more lime for her. It was just real bad. She says the only thing right in the soup was the fish was not over cooked. But she found certain things in her bowl that would generally not be in it. Calamari ring...WTF? She added a good amount of chili to compensate the taste. Nope. Total fail. Absolute total fail of an establishment. I'd advise not coming here for pho or any dish."}
{"text":"I order the same thing at every Vietnamese restaurant. Rice Vermicelli Bun with Grilled Pork and Egg Roll, and spring rolls. This order does not change. Ever.  They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I don't know which I prefer as they are very very different.  You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. It's pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive."}
{"text":"I love this place, what more can I say! Thai tea - excellent! Rau ma (no sugar) - yumm, & healthy (for maintaining youthfulness, purifying the blood, curing nervous conditions, improving eyesight & memory, and relieving arthritis pain, & more). Spring rolls - I haven't found a better place that serves them! My fave - Porkchops over broken rice... I could eat that everyday!!! Pho - It's good, but in summertime who feels like having soup says most Caucasians. Orientals eat hot stuff (tea, etc.) morning, noon, & night regardless of the weather.. must be something to it, why they are so thin, & Americans are so fat! Last but not least, coffee - If I wasn't breast-feeding & worried about how many jiggawatts my baby would get... Well, enough said, I miss it though!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Pho, hands down. The \"ambiance\" isn't what you go for, if you go for good Pho and nothing else, you will be satisfied.  It's quick, they get the meal right, it's simple, delicious and my favorite Pho place!"}
{"text":"Never had pho at all till my subordinate took me to this little place down in the hood for lunch.  We used his dad's black coloured credit card to cover the expenses.   Parking sucked at this place it was horrible, your car will get damage if you attempt to park here!!  So we decided to park across the street.  As we were walking to the door we were kindly greeted by a local bum.  Unfortunately we had no money to give him...we were using my subordinate dad's credit card after all.  When we got in we were greeted and seated.  The place was tight, and a little dirty.  The chop sticks were sticky, and soup ladle thing was sticky and gross, but we were hungry, that didn't stop us.  We had to use the lemon from our water to wipe down the utensils.  I recommend doing this at any pho place... or request for packaged wooden sticks.  We each ordered the #1 pho and some spring rolls.   The pho was good but the spring roll was gross, like a bunch of vegetables and shrimp stuff in a little rubber bag..... keeping it PG here.  And that peanut sauce thing didn't not go well for me.  But the pho's good.  The broth is very good.   Overall a good experience, the price is good, and the pho is good as well.  The loo is dirty, so do a two before you come. Deuces!"}
{"text":"It was good but not the greatest customer service. They didn't fill up our cups and the waiting didn't speak English. When we would ask for something he was stare at us and just walk away. Soup was good but not better then da vang. Da Vang is still #1 in my book"}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving for a good bowl of Pho and unfortunately I was terribly disappointed.   Service,  They do not have any class of services, rude and loud is the first perception that I got.   Food quality,  I ordered my usual pho combo that I take every time into any pho place : Imperial roll, large pho dac biet and iced coffee.  The imperial roll has 3 rolls, came with a pitiful small amount of sauce, approximately 2 tea spoons. How much does the sauce cost??? Seriously I could barely dip the roll into the sauce, what's the point of giving it?  The Pho was tasteless, flavourless, well to be positive, they don't put too much MSG. Lol Iced Coffee was over sweetened, unlike other Vietnamese Pho places where they'd brew the coffee only when you order, this place actually have them prepared in advance and leave it in the fridge.   Price,  I guess the term \"you get what you pay for\" goes with this restaurant. Price is fairly cheaper than majority of a similar type of restaurant however, they are located in the West Island, which is pretty normal to be slightly cheaper than restaurants in downtown of MTL."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pho, what's better than a great big bowl of broth with some meat, veggies and noodles. I have had a hard time finding Pho in Phoenix, which btw would be a great Pho restaurant name (Pho Phoenix), anyway Yelp led my gf and I to Pho Thanh. Very authentic Vietnamese place with great  a huge selection of Pho and other Vietnamese dishes. I would recommend the tofu over the beef. Great prices and great Pho."}
{"text":"My go to for Pho and Goi Cuon!  Been coming here for YEARS before they got packed for winning best of on New Times!  Legit place.  Come for Authentic Vietnamese food. Prices are ridiculous in an affordable way and veggies are freah."}
{"text":"I had a lunch here today, pretty crowded, it's a good sign. I love this place, it's cheaper than Little Saigon. I'm a big fan now. My favorite is 24a. =)"}
{"text":"The food is great, quick, cheap, and something I'd normally come back for. Probably some of the best pho I've had in a while. What stops me from coming back though is the rather curt and dismissive service we experienced in this place. If service is not important to you, then this is something to check out, but with service being half of the experience in my book, we're not coming back."}
{"text":"As a native Portlander I've been eating quality Pho since middle school. When I moved to Phoenix I assumed my Pho loving days were over, but alas Pho Thanh is extremely authentic and just as good as some of the places I grew up frequenting. I'm now a regular and I can't sing their praises enough!"}
{"text":"That's the biggest bowl of pho for 8 bucks awesome very hot feeling drunk on pho love"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in phx. Quick service. Not very friendly staff, but I'm told that's how you know it's legit viet."}
{"text":"This place is so good and a great price point.  It is a little divey but it is so worth it. My coworkers and i go at least once a week!  Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"The pho was good.  Broth, really good.  Four stars for my bowl of Pho Ga.  The place is a pit grimy, kinda dirty.  Nothing special, but authentic.  My big complaint was my veggie spring rolls.  Tasteless, and the tofu tasted old and was super dry.  Was not a fan.  My friends both got veggie dishes... one thought hers was okay the other did not at all like hers.  If you are just going for a good bowl of pho, this place will hit the spot..  avoid other menu items..."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Large portions and really cheap. Service is really bad. They are fast but not very friendly. But bc the food and the pieces go weekly."}
{"text":"The beef pho is the best I've had ever! The beef is so tender it melts in your mouth. The broth and everything else is so fresh and delish i travel about 30 mins just to eat here."}
{"text":"Im from Dallas Tx and stopped in cause I was craving pho. Ordered pho dac biet. Broth was sweet but lacked the aroma. I felt like it was missing something. They do not skimp out on the beef which is a plus. Meatballs, I'll pass. The texture was strange and tasted frost bitten. The service was excellent though. If im ever in Phoenix, I'll reconsider coming back and trying something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I have had some flavorful pho in Little Saigon in California but needed to fulfill my pho-craving in Phoenix and ended up at Pho Thanh. The restaurant is like any average Vietnamese style eatery, with simple tables lined with the different sauces, and ample amount of space for tables. This set-up attracts every type of consumer, from families to couples, but you can tell most people are just coming trying to save a buck. We started with the spring rolls. The large portion of greens in comparison to the other ingredients made it hard to taste the other flavors, and it came off as bland. Then the broken rice came, and the fish cakes were seasoned phenomenally on the side and so we eat that quickly. As for the pho, the broth was seasoned well, but the meat was a bit overdone, and the tripe was cooked but didn't seem to be the freshest.  Overall, it had some things going for them, but not enough to make me come back."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese place in town. Do not let the decor or lack there of deter you. The place is small and quite cozy. The food is by far the tastiest in the land. The service is friendly and the price is within range. A must go place for anyone who fancies some hot pho!"}
{"text":"Not really feeling the 5 stars that others are giving out. The food was pretty average in terms of taste and quality. Nothing really stood out. The prices and portions are fair. The place was busy, which is a good sign. We got seated after a few minutes of waiting at the front door. The food came out rather quickly. Reading through the reviews it sounds like this place is one in a few in Phoenix, which may explain how these ratings skew higher. I think, for a quick Vietnamese craving this place hits the spot. My sister agrees, and she's more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"I love LOVE Pho Thanh. The thai tea, the giant bowls of soups, (my favorite is the udon soup). I've been here many times and would always go again. Great food for GREAT prices. And you get ALOT of it."}
{"text":"I've literally been on what I've called my weird soup quest and Pho Thanh did not disappoint. I tried one of their Pho dishes and the flavor was amazing and you cannot beat the price. If you are looking for great Pho for a pretty sweet price, you have to try this place. I know I will be back for more Pho."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant.  I was unsure what I wanted to get so I decided to try the rice combination platter.  I usually get pho, vermicelli bowls, rice plates.   I'd rate the dish 3 out of 5 stars. I should of just ordered something I normally get. But it was edible!   I would definitely come back here, but order my go tos!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times already in the past two weeks and I can say this is going to be my new Vietnamese Go-To Spot.   Portions are huge, price is cheap, food is spot on! Service could be better, I always find myself waving down servers for something, but its not bad enough where it keeps me from coming to this place.   Oh yeah!

{"text":"Went there last weekend in early afternoon. It was our 2nd choice and sadly it did not deliver. Broth was average, price fair but service was rather hostile. Both servers were kept rushing us to order as we were settling down. It was no waiting line, plenty of tables around. Breathe and relax. Don't know if it was that we had 3 small children and they wanted us out faster than the meals could be ordered.  We got so many dirty looks from staff, eye rolling when asking for extra plate or fork. Perhaps they had a bad day, but when clients feel unwelcome the meal taste less a good. Sad, it had so much potential."}
{"text":"When I realized I would be stopping by Phoenix, I asked my Phoenix food experts what was recommended in the area. My dad had been craving pho since Flagstaff, but all the pho restaurants in that area closed super early. Daniel L. recommended Pho Thanh, and from his review - it seemed like one of the better pho places in the area.   Pho Thanh was close to our hotel and pretty easy to find. It's located in a moderate sized plaza with a good number of parking. This Vietnamese restaurant is pretty big. I think they have been expanding more and more due to the number of return customers. The restaurant closes at 8 PM, and we arrived at 7:45 thinking that we might not make it; however, they still take customers up to the very last minute (or so it seemed). People were walking in at 8 on the dot! I guess the kitchen doesn't close right at 8, which is nice. We were told to sit at any table - one side of the restaurant was closed off, but there was a good number of tables on the other open half.   Menu is not too complicated. They actually serve hot pot here, but we came for pho, so that's what we stuck with.   Fresh pork and shrimp spring rolls: $2.50 for a serving of 2 rolls. A lot of pho restaurants in LA no longer serve spring rolls because of the uncertainty of the rice paper. I was so glad I got to try Pho Thanh's spring rolls because they were pretty amazing. I wouldn't say they're on Brodard's level, but they were really tasty. One couple actually came into the restaurant and ordered 10 orders of spring rolls for their meal. Yep, the rolls were stuffed with shrimp, pork, and other vegetable items. The peanut dipping sauce was also very fresh - had a hard time sharing this item with my parents because it was so good!   I ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien - sliced beef with meatballs; price was only $5.95 - a steal compared to what you pay in the SGV! And the bowls were pretty big ... super filling meal after a day of driving. The slices of beef are not as thinly cut or as tender as I've experienced, but the flavor was good. There was actually way more beef slices and meatball pieces than I expected. After eating my way through the bowl, I was surprised to find that I still had more slices resting on the bottom of the bowl! Noodles were standards. The broth was tasty! Good flavor and taste, although my dad still thinks that Pho Pasteur has the best broth in terms of flavor.   The original Pho Dac Biet comes with sliced beef, meatballs, brisket, tendon and tripe for $6.45. Tons of ingredients and a good amount of noodles. I'd recommend ordering this if you're not sure what to order and want to try a little of everything.   Service was fast and attentive considering the fact that we stayed past 8. We were in and out within 30 minutes, and there was still a good number of tables filled when we left.   tl;dr - A good and solid place to get pho if you're in Phoenix. Highly recommend ordering their spring rolls! They seem to produce quality items no matter what you order, but I enjoyed the beef/meatball pho. Prices are a steal!"}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese spot! Very speedy service. Phenomenal pho tai.. Very fragrant broth! Egg rolls were better than the spring rolls. Beef in the soup was perfect size.. Some times you order pho and the beef is in such huge pieces.. This was perfect bite sizes. Place was super busy even on a Sunday night so I am sure that everything on the menu is great. Will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I am little late to review this, but better now than never.   I had a fun time attending the first Yelp AZ International Supper Club at Pho Thanh.   It was a perfect pick by Gabi as I was really craving for Vietnamese food that night.  I had ordered the Bun Bi Cha Gio (vermicelli with eggrolls, seasoned shredded pork, vegetables, crushed peanuts and fish sauce).  This is the best noodle dish especially when outside is so hot!   It will definitely cool you off.   I also had the whole young coconut.  The coconut juice and the meat were so fresh.  You might need to have some serious elbow grease to remove the meat inside the coconut.  I would warn the people sitting around in case you hit them.  Sorry to be so critical but I was so excited to have a \"Vietnamese\" restaurant in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Phx! Very fast. Food consistently great! Chicken Pho is great, only white meat. Number 39 is a knock out! Spring rolls are great too!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Pho.  It has taken ages but a nice cold rainy sunday afternoon was enough to convince me that it was time to try this soup-like concoction.  I sure am glad that I did!  This stuff was great.  I ordered one that had meatballs in it.  The meatballs were a bit more like sausages but they were still tasty.  I'm probably not the person you want to listen to when it comes to Pho reviews since this was my first try but I really enjoyed it.  For anyone who has thought about it but never gone - this seems like as good a place as any to start.  My only problem was with the service.  They were very disorganized and slow.  It was busy...but I'd still like to see a bit more hustle from the waiters."}
{"text":"The Pho is oh so good. While I questioned the restaurants cleanliness, due to the swarm of flies I was greeted by I decided to give it a try. The staff isn't all that warm or friendly I presume due to a cultural difference they are nice enough.   Don't expect the waiter come by all that often to check on you if at all. would have liked to have seen a couple more drinks. I think the water is for refills as we're getting ready to leave.  The food was amazing traditional Vietnamese, and very well done. I would recommend it for the food, not the atmosphere.  I return serval times since my first visit and will continue to until I find a place with food as good but with less fly's.  FYI when you're done eating you will have to go to the register to pay and if you leave a tip on the table it will be picked up by the guys cleaning the table and not your waiter. I don't know if they pool their tips but just something I observed."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place! Small selection of vegetarian, but amazing food period :))"}
{"text":"6/27/17 update: So I've come here a lot recently, mainly because my dad likes this place and I go out to eat here with him often.  If you don't take into account the lower service, the value for some actual good, genuine vietnamese food here is hard to beat.   This place really dropped in both quality and quantity since the last time I came here.  They also expanded their restaurant.    It's disappointing, really, since we used to love coming to this place for the huge portions they always gave.  Soup is seriously lacking in flavor, noodle is about 60% of what they used to serve, and now we get a few pieces of meat with at most 1-2 pieces of tripe and tendon.  Price is still as low as ever, but the food quantity reflects it now."}
{"text":"THE best pho ever. I can't stop eating here. The staff does their job well and the prices are incredible. If you're heading there for lunch, however, try to go before or after about noon to 1:00 p.m. It can be crowded, but it serves as the best indication for their amazing food."}
{"text":"Pho  It's pronounced \"/feu/\"...does that help anybody?  Okay...sounds like \"fun\" only without the \"n\", and \"Thành\" sounds like \"tang\", minus the \"g\".  If you run \"Pho Thành\" through a translator, it translates as either \"Cheese Bar\" or \"The Streets\"...or, as they say in Ho Chi Minh City (nee Saigon)...\"Cheese Bar\".  I couldn't say what a cheese bar has to do with this delightful little place...I didn't see any cheese on the menu, nor is there anything cheesy about the place...just straight ahead, well made, tasty (and although Dr. Andrew Weill shudders when he hears me say it)...healthy Vietnamese food!  And while I'm on the subject of Dr. Weill...since when did a sweaty 350 pound recluse (with the remains of the entire turkey dinner with all the \"trimmin's\" that he evidently had for breakfast floating around in his beard), become the \"healthy living\" guru for a generation?  I'm puzzled...not that I don't want his lifestyle...I do!  Still, it's a mystery!  There's no mystery at Pho Thành...just unpronounceable menu selections and great Pho!  I've learned over the years to make my selections either by pointing at the menu and smiling or by saying things like \"I'll have a number 2 and number 38, with a diet Coke, please\".  Back when I was very young and still had my swagger on, I would stroll into one of the great Vietnamese joints in Portland, sit down and say \"Pho Me\"!  So funny!...At least to me.  That phrase led to several misunderstandings, \"incidents\"  and police reports, as well as a lengthy stint of child support payments for little Nguyen Dat S. (although he really looks nothing like me...but I do get a Christmas card from him and his family every year...nice!).  But that's the dimly remembered past!  Yesterday, I met a couple of my buddies in the Mekong Delta (you know, the West Side vortex of great Pho...the triangle between Maxim, Da Vang and Pho Thành) and we had a great time at lunch!  My buddies are both attorneys, suckling at the supple twin teats of misery and money and the stories they tell at lunch would make most people writhe in despair...but not us...we are made of sterner stuff!  We split an order of Goi Cuon and Cha Gio and dug into our respective bowls of Pho...delicious, delicious Pho ...no question!  All of the standard high quality Pho prep tools are there to perfect your soup...sawtooth herb, basil, bean sprouts, and enough hot chili in several different forms to cause you severe pain the next morning...it lets you know you're alive...important at my age!  This particular Mekong Delta doesn't require a Ghe Nang or a Swift Boat to navigate, just hop on the light rail or risk your life in Camelback traffic and drop on by.  Just don't say \"Pho Me\"..."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Vietnamese food and I let Yelp lead me here!! This place was packed with several large Vietnamese families I can see why. Wow! The menu was unlike many other Vietnamese place I have been to, huge selection. I started off with the pork and shrimp spring rolls. Ahh man!! While I usually make this just my meal I decided to order a main dish item, knowing the extra would go for a meal the next day. I ordered the house special broken rice dish (#59) I believe. I was amazed at the amount of food when this came out. A fried egg, chopped shrimp wrapped in bean curd, seasoned beef meatball wrapped in a grape leaf, BBQ pork, a slice of a meat loaf, fresh sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and daikon radish, a bowl of broth and a sweet vinegar sauce. All this was individually placed over the broken rice (except broth and vinegar sauce). Being full from the spring rolls, I managed to eat the fried egg and the beef in the grape leaves. WOW. Soo tasty!! And so much left over!! Before tip this was under $10!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this one a 3.5 stars.   Service is kind of like Maxim.... they're very direct. That being said I got a menu and sat at a table. Was looking at the menu for a minute or two when I was asked by a server if I was eating there or to go. He then took my order. I got the meatball pho soup (no noodles) for $2.95 or so, as well as a fried rice with chicken for $6.25. To drink I got a coffee...  The Pho: I liked it. I think I'm okay with pho as long as I don't put any sauce in it.... don't know why they serve it with it lol. But either way, it was a nice bowl and I couldn't even finish all of the broth. But it had good meat and some veggies with it.   The Rice: The rice was great. It was very good and a good portion. Took most of it to go because I was pretty full from the pho. But am looking forward to eating the other half for lunch tomorrow.   The Coffee: So because of the amazing coffee I had at Maxim I was hoping it would be the same here... it was the same type, only they brought the thing to the table over a cup in a cup of water.... and once it finished dripping (by then it was kind of cold tbh) then you could drink it..... maybe I just didn't do something right but it wasn't nearly as good.... it was way too sweet but not that bad. Probably won't get it here again.   Overall... will likely be back."}
{"text":"I'll make it short and simple...   Great food. Amazing price. Very generous portions...."}
{"text":"When Da Vang is closed and my friends and i have a hunger for Pho we had no choice but to come to Pho Thanh. The food is good great prices! Service is so bad! We only goto Da Vang now. We refuse togo to Pho Thanh. We are so sick of the bad service and the servers getting our order wrong we havent been to Pho Thanh in over a year. and we eat Vietnamese twice a week"}
{"text":"I'm by no means a phô expert, hell, I barely discovered the dish 2 years ago, and I've always got the same exact thing. But as far as the phô I have eaten, from Texas to Vegas to (now) Phoenix, this place is legit.   Tucked in to one of the sketchiest shopping centers in town, complete with dudes walking car to car asking for money, abandoned buildings and homeless people getting a late morning nap in, you'll find this gem of a phô place. But don't let the location fool you, this place is legit, and stays packed! I'm talking like standing room only kinda packed. From locals to passers by, families just leaving church and coworkers on lunch break, this place stays packed.   Very big menu, and all the staples of phô you'd expect. They even have that ever so delicious Thai tea! Everything is very affordable too. Good food and good prices.   This place is phô real, mayne."}
{"text":"This place got me hooked on pho. Since eating here, I have tried numerous pho restaurants but none are as good as this place. I live far but it is absolutely worth the drive. The broth is incredible and they give you lots of herbs/limes/onions to put in with your pho. I would recommend taking it to go rather than dining in. It can be very crowded, average service, and not the typical restaurant-y feel to it. AMAZING pho though. Best I have tried in all of greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The best pho ever! Live in LA and visiting Phoenix. We need soup noodle so came here to get pho. Soup is rich and very delicious! Me and my friend are happy for this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I love their pho dac biet and the rice dice with grilled pork and fried eggs on top."}
{"text":"The shrimp rolls were crisp and the basil was abundant. I ordered the vegetarian pho: tofu, cabbage, Bok choy, broccoli, and onions. The serving was hearty although I wish there would have been more broccoli. This is definitely a no frills place, but if you want true pho at a great price, come here!"}
{"text":"Best Pho around. I've tried pho at other restaurants and the flavor is just not there.  The spring rolls, beef and broccoli and shrimp fried rice is very good. They put a lot of shrimp in the fried rice too.  They are reasonably priced as well.  You can take your whole family to dinner and not spend too much. Try the limeade as well  it's quite refreshing."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here it is always crazy busy. Filled with all kinds of diverse groups of people. Even though they serve so many tables at once they are very fast at bringing your table drinks, refills, and food. Ive never have to wait long for anything. However the servers here aren't the ones to talk to you at all they just give you what you need and go which is fine with me, I came here to eat! I like their food but I've had better grilled pork. This place is very cheap compared to other pho restaurants I've been to I believe it came out to $13 for two people ?"}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall who serves the best pho. The environment is very simple, but you will be impressed on why this spot is completely packed during lunch hours. Their food is tasty, flavorful, and it comes at a cheap price ($4-7 per gigantic bowl of pho). This location also got featured in Phoenix Magazine (July 2012) Cheap Eats across the valley! Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pho! The broth has the best flavor and they give you plenty of veggies. They have fast service and this place is always full! Great place! The outside looks kind of sketchy but the food is great."}
{"text":"Its a good restaurant. The food is good. There is sometimes a little bit of wait. The service is pretty good. Ive been many places but this one is by far the best. I recommend the spring rolls as an appetizer. The soup is a good price for the size of bowl you get. And i always go home with extra. There are restrooms and the place is clean. The seating is wait to be seated."}
{"text":"In my opinion,  the best Pho spot in Phoenix... I should know,  I tried most of them Lol"}
{"text":"Pho Thanh is a great Vietnamese joint that provides delicious Pho to everyone and anyone that enjoys partaking in savory broth goodness. I actually just observed the many bowls and happy guests consuming the large bowls of noodles and broth, and instead partook in the vermecelli dish with pickled vegetables, grilled smokey pork, salad, peanuts and fish sauce to toss all together. It is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes, and Pho Thanh does it well.  I got it with a refreshing coconut that was perfectly ripe and a great accompaniment to my lunch.   Prices are super reasonable/low compared to the Pho restaurant I have access to in Tucson, AZ. So even if you don't have deep pockets, you can come and enjoy a delicious bowl of Vietnamese food that won't break the bank.  Slurp up!"}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews, and it did not disappoint! No real frills or thrills, but delicious food. If you're really hungry get the XXL Pho bowl... Real reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Still the best pho in town! They opened up a wall which makes alot more room now! they are always super fast, friendly, and very affordable!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for authentic Vietnamese cuisine.  I usually order their Pho with everything on it and I love their food, the amount of Pho you get is definitely worth the price.  I have been here twice and whenever I see a waiter bring a dish at another table, it often smells good, looks good and for sure probably taste good.  I look forward to coming back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! My boyfriend and I just went here for a late lunch/early dinner so that he could try pho... He finished his whole bowl! Which was a feat because they give you so much food. I couldn't even eat half of mine. For about $5-6 per massive bowl it's a great value and so delicious. I had been craving pho for months and finally found a place just a few minutes from home!"}
{"text":"Wow. This is the pho I have been searching for in Phoenix. Dare I say it puts the pho in Phoenix *teehee.* I have been looking for good pho since I moved here from Seattle (land of pho every 20 feet) and never found a place that measured up. Generally, the broth was bland and the dish was americanized and way overpriced. Well, look no further, this is the real deal. From the minute you walk in, you can tell this place is more authentic than most. They have communal tables with grab-your-own chopsticks, spoons, condiments, etc. There is no fancy decor. Who needs it when the food is so good? The pho comes out in a large bowl and the price is right (like 6$). I had the Pho filet and the broth was flavorful,  the meat was tender, and the noodles were abundant. I also had a legit Thai Tea. I came here with an unexpected group of 7 people (I think... Amanda B and her daughter, Irene V, Amy H, Jon H, Rachelle H, and some others) and the restaurant accommodated (despite being very busy and mostly thanks to Irene V). I will certainly be back here in the near future!"}
{"text":"Best Pho I had outside of Los Angeles. Best eggrolls ever!  It was just my girlfriend and I. We seriously ordered enough food to feed 4 people and out bill was only $32.  Awesome food and ridiculously low prices. Tood bad its not in Los Angeles, I would be there every week.  The other comments you see about cleanliness and service are true. The staff is not the friendliest or the most helpful, most of them walk around like they are forced to be there. No warm greeting when you sit down. They don't come by to check on you, you'll have to wave some one down and if they speak enough english you will get what you want.... eventually.  After all that, I would still go back."}
{"text":"The first time i came here per recommendation of a friend it was great but this time was a complete 180. I came with two of my friends  and the server was completely rude and ignored us..we ended up leaving without ordering"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The decor in the restaurant is a little bit on the cheap side, and it shows. It's not bad, just a little bit run down.  FOOD: The soup itself was pretty good. No big complaints there. Unfortunately, the mint, coriander and the bean sprouts that pho usually comes with weren't fresh at all. The color was turning brown and you can just tell that they were old. I would only come here if I was in the West Island and all the other pho spots were closed. Ultimately, I would recommend going downtown for better quality pho.  PRICE: Prices were good, not too expensive, especially considering the fact that you're in the West Island and you get a good portion of food.  SERVICE: Unfortunately, this aspect was lacking as well. The waiters were ok but the lady who takes your payments was rude and very cold."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Best bowl of Pho in the city, if you ask me. The service is always quick and price is a great value. The interior is a little institutional in nature, for a churn and burn pace, but delicious food, quick service and a huge menu give it the edge that the ambiance lacks. When food is stellar, a hole in the wall spot can slide on the less important details."}
{"text":"Why are you so far away?   The best Pho I've had since moving out here from California. Cheap and good, just how I remember it. :)  The food is usually out pretty fast and portions are generous, for 3 people the total came out to be around 30 something dollars, drinks, spring rolls and pho bowls all around. I'm sure that I'll be returning multiple times.  You know you've hit a gold mine for a pho place when everyone working there has a thick Vietnamese accent and is located in some dingy Asian plaza."}
{"text":"This is a strong candidate for the best pho  in Phoenix. Quick service, authentic taste, and busy atmosphere gives this place a gold star.   Must order the egg rolls, crunchy and delicious and the Pho Tai Nam, with beef brisket and steak. The whole deal comes to maybe $11. This is my favorite place for a solo date by myself, or bringing friends or my boo for a casual lunch/dinner. Located just off the light rail."}
{"text":"So delicious!! The spring rolls are so good, and the beef pho was incredible. Best pho in Phoenix!! Big portions and very affordable"}
{"text":"I've now been to Pho Than Many more times.  I've brought coworkers, friends, employees and relatives.  Pho Than is hands down the best Vietnamese food I've had in the valley so far.   Definitely up from 4 stars to 5.  Try the coconut rice pudding with Taro root.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Good pho, the steak or whatever was really fatty in my bowl but leaner in my girlfriends. The egg rolls are super bomb. If you haven't been in before maybe glance at the menu before your first visit. The servers come at you hard and fast wanting to take your order, so be prepared. Everything also comes out pretty fast even when the place is packed. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went by last night and first thing noticed was how full the parking lot was...good sign that the food must be great.  My hubby isn't a big fan of Asian cuisine, but I encouraged him to at least try it.  He was quite frustrated by the parking lot issues as some of the people were absolutely rude in their parking etiquette (stopping in the driving lane and just parking and being loud and obnoxious while holding up several cars all around)  Once inside and had placed our to go order, we waited for at least 30 minutes for the food, further frustrating my hubby.  Well, needless to say once we got home and he took one nice bite of the egg roll, all of his feelings of frustration were gone.!  He said it was the best egg roll he has ever had here in Phoenix...after trying the Beef Soup with noodles and Won Ton Soup with veggies, I believe he is hooked.  Next time though I will definitely call our order in and pick it up so we don't have to deal with the insanity of the parking lot."}
{"text":"My family has been here hundreds of times, and it's fantastic food every time! We always start with their spring rolls, as they have a very refreshing mint taste to them, along with a tasty, sweet peanut sauce.   There's a couple of different things that I get whenever I come here. The first is their signature pho - the beef noodle soup with everything in it. Their broth is absolutely tasty, so if there's a meat you don't want to eat, anything mixed into the beef broth will be fantastic.   If you're not into soup, their vermicelli bowls are also a hit! I normally get the one with the grilled pork, ground shrimp, egg rolls, and vegetables, as the variety creates a nice mix of flavors.  This past endeavor to Pho Thanh, I got one of their egg noodle soup dishes with pork, shrimp, and wontons, which is also delicious and has a lighter soup taste to it.  If you want a sweet drink, I would definitely recommend the \"3 colored dessert\", which has mung beans, red beans, green jelly, and coconut milk. Sweet and creamy, and something most people don't think of trying when they think Vietnamese food, but 100% a Vietnamese favorite.   Will continue to be a fan of this place until I die."}
{"text":"I've been a Da Vang devotee for years and wanted to try a new Vietnamese place tonight and Pho Thanh didn't fall short. In fact, I think I might like this place a little better than Da Vang, but I'll rotate between the two since they're both so good.  First off, the portions are gigantic! The Bun bowl could easily serve two and I had tons of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. They use the fat rice noodles instead of the vermicelli, but I think it made the dish a little heartier and certainly easier to eat with chopsticks.  Hubby had the Pho and the broth was amazing! Savory, a little salty, and the spices were perfect. Perfect to warm your bones on a rainy day.  The restaurant was more of a cafe style than family sit down, but exceptionally clean and the service was great. There was quite a diverse crowd in there for a Sunday night and everyone's dishes looked fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband is the obsessive Pho fan so I am constantly subjected to the pleas of Vietnamese take-out. We came here the other day for lunch and there were things I liked and didn't. We ordered the fried spring rolls ($2.50, I think) that were pretty damn good. For lunch I ordered the BBQ pork bahn-mi (sp?) that was $2.25. The bread was just the way I like it, soft on the inside, flaky on the outside. It was stuffed with BBQ pork, cucumber, cilantro, carrots and some other veggies. I snagged some of the leftover sprouts from my husband's Pho and put it in my sandwich. Very good. My beefs? Half of the meat in my sandwich was all fat. I am one of those people that virtually loses my appetite if I chew on something that has fat hanging off the side. My husband, who loves the fat, was shocked at how much of the \"meat\" in my sandwich I was giving him. I had plenty to eat of what was fast becoming a veggie sandwich but still, that was pretty annoying. The last thing I want to do is be picking my food apart in a restaurant. My second beef was that not once did they come back to refill our water. That was a problem since our food was a little spicy. That isn't to say I wouldn't go back. Our bill was $10 for lunch....seriously Pho Thahn? That is damn reasonable and the food is decent enough for me to go back....for take-out."}
{"text":"Most of us, still drunk from the night before ventured out to find the hangover cure, aka pho and stumbled upon this little place, Pho Thanh...  Upon first impression, the place was packed (good sign!), very clean and full of employees cleaning off tables. We seated ourselves and someone came to our table right away to take our drink orders..  I was more than thrilled to discover that they had a section in their menu just for vegetarians (no scanning through the whole menu to find veg options)! While everyone else was ordering their pork spring rolls, shrimp spring rolls and pork pho... I went with the Cuon Chay which is the fresh vegetable spring rolls with imitation shredded pork and the Canh Chua Chay which is a sweet & sour tamarind soup. Beautiful presentation and such an impact of flavor! Portions are HUGE. I took more than half of my bowl of soup home! I enjoyed every single bite. My meat eating friends enjoyed their dishes as well! First time trying pho for me, (vegan pho at that!) and it was DELICIOUS! They had all kinds of authentic drinks too, which I thought was really neat! Can't wait to try the soy milk they make in house!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. Great prices. Good food. I normally order beef pho and a spring roll. Sometimes I get the bahn mi sandwich.  My friends all prefer Da Vang.  I honestly can't say i disagree. But I still really like this place. It seems like they have a slightly larger menu."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town!! I have learned to ask for everything you need while ordering because the runners who bring your food don't speak much. This place is clean, the food and herbs are always fresh and we love eating here!!"}
{"text":"I ate here the first time I tried Vietnamese food and I'm happy I did because now it is a huge favorite of mine. My favorite dish is the lemongrass vermacili bowl and of course I love there Thai tea and spring rolls."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Pho Thanh over the years, but I never tried it because I was a little put-off by the uninviting exterior.  I decided to finally give it a try last week and I was happy with the experience!  The inside is a lot larger than it looks from the outside.  And the decor/cleanliness is decent, typical Vietnamese restaurant.  The spring rolls here are the best I've had in Phoenix (and the cheapest!).  Their spring rolls are around $2.50 where everywhere else it's at least $4-5.  The pho was okay, though I wish it had come with a bit more meat and that the meat had not been so well-done (I like it on the medium rare side).  I still prefer Pho Dalat in Tempe (even though it's pricier) but I'll come here when I am craving Vietnamese and don't want to drive to the East Valley."}
{"text":"The best part of Pho Thanh is the flavor of pho broth. It really tastes home made where the bones are boiled for hours. Also, you don't taste any msg here; I've noticed I didn't get overly thirsty after eating here. I only wished my pho came out hotter. Once I added the bean sprouts, the broth wasn't hot enough to blanch them. Spring rolls were freshly made and was really tasty.  This place gets packed but service is fast. Tables are set up very close to one another so be friendly to your neighbors. Would go again."}
{"text":"This was my first pho experience in Phoenix, and, as you might've guessed by my five-star rating, I wasn't disappointed.  I'll start off with a disclaimer about the location: it's in one of Phoenix's sketchier areas, and I've never not seen a homeless person walking around in the strip mall it's located in. That being said, if you go in the day you should be fine. I can't speak to how ghetto it might get at night.  This isn't one of those Vietnamese places that invests a lot in ambiance. You walk in and usually are greeted by a busy wait staff and plenty of customers. I've never had to wait long for a table though. Compared to places I've been in Tucson, Albuquerque and California, the prices are a steal - a little over $5 for a decent sized bowl of some of the best pho I've ever had. One of the other reviewers praised the broth, and I have to agree - no need to drown it with hoisin and sriracha too much. They don't skimp on garnishings like some of the other places I've been too either. Their spring rolls make an excellent appetizer. If you're not in the mood for pho, feel free to grab one of their banh mi - also decently priced and plenty of bang for your buck.  All in all, a great place, and one that I look forward to returning to."}
{"text":"I actually liked what I got that is why I gave it a three star rather than two stars like my girlfriend did. I would have given 2 stars as well if I got what she got. She got just regular rice stick noodle pho with beef and beef balls. The broth did lack a lot of flavor and being from San Jose, Ca, not good at all. I have definitely had a lot better.  I got the spicy beef soup with vermicelli. I usually wouldn't get anything with vermicelli because I am not a fan, but this was delicious! The soup was spicy and very flavorful. But to be honest, I think that anything spicy is flavorful. There was a lot of meat in it and they did not hold back. I was really happy about that.   I was impressed about the vegetables they gave. They had some banana tree shavings, love it. My mom uses it a lot and it really reminded me of home.   I did not like the sandwich at all. I am use to more meat in vietnamese sandwiches and the bread was too soft. I am use to fresh crunch baguettes.  Not sure I will come back"}
{"text":"I've wanted to check out Pho Thanh for quite a while now based on on the Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away.  The interior of the restaurant is very unexpected -- larger and brighter than expected.  The pho, on the other hand, was a let down. The broth is very greasy!  I mean, VERY greasy!  That's a huge turnoff for me.  I also think it lacked flavor, as I found myself having to continuously add things to it to make it flavorful.  Also, the spring roll was just kind of bleh.  I've definitely had better.  Next time I'll just make my way down to Maxim."}
{"text":"This is the best pho in town and also how I completed a degree at GCU without getting sick. The broth is amazing and the service is quick. In addition this place is college student budget friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best Pho we've had since moving to AZ in 2015. We are always searching to try new restaurants that offer it and this one just stays on our number 1 pick.   The first time I had Pho, was from a Vietnamese friend and this is as close as I can get to the amazing soup she has made. Delicious."}
{"text":"This is truly an amazing place. I live on the other side of town and will only come to Pho Thanh to get my pho. Been coming here for many years, since I was very little. Some of the staff are even old family friends. Their pho is the best. No other way to put it. I also love their rice plates but the main reason for anyone to come here is to experience the soup. Parking can be crowded sometimes because of the market next door. I see some people complaining about the service or that the waiters stare. They've been here forever and they have a system. It works. If you don't like it, boo hoo. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very delicious & cheap!! You must try #112, seriously amazing veggie soup! Also, the spring rolls are delicious. Everything just tastes fresh and yummy. Not to mention for 3 people, 3 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 2 drinks, less than $30. Definitely will be going back and back and back again."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed our food there. #12 beef soup and #75 are our favorites. Would try some others dishes too, just can't skip that two, and serving is huge."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!   Ok first the bad... this place is not that pretty inside.   That ends the bad - who cares! The food is so good!!!! This place has some amazing team work going on too.   We ordered spring rolls and beef pho. The spring rolls were 3/5. The pho though, was off the charts!!! The broth was delicious. Just the right amount of broth, noodles, meat and treats!   I will definitely be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Super prices. Food comes out fast. Check out line to pay is long.  It's far from work, but well worth the trip. Seating is much better now that they have expanded. Always packed. Sometimes people waiting for a seat. Shared tables which are put together. Pho is fantastic."}
{"text":"The best pho I have ever had! prices are dirt cheap and the food is amazing! Do the spring rolls and you won't regret it. can't say enough good things. It is a little dirty but....well....don't go to a hole in the wall pho house if you want white table cloths."}
{"text":"Should I do it?...I'm gonna do it...buuuuut...yeah, I'm gonna do it...this place is PHO real!!! There...but I'm seriously...it's legit. AND peep this, yo: they have coconut water STRAIGHT from a coconut...like your cup IS a coconut...that ish is tight...the service is very Seinfeld \"Soup Nazi\"-esk, but I'm willing to deal with that if it means I get to mow down on some deliciousness. Looking forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"They have an even bigger dining room and still fill up frequently because the food is always good and the service is very straightforward and prompt. Nothing fancy, but my favorite is the pho and bun."}
{"text":"The food here across the border was not too good of experience for our entire party, but there aren't too many Vietnamese places like in California, so I can't completely give low stars.  The attention to customers and service was pretty decent for an Asian place."}
{"text":"You don't come here for the service, BUT it's my favorite place for pho. The fried egg rolls have my heart and their Tai tea is the the best."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple! This place is quick, cheap, and delicious. They give you good portions for the price you pay compared to other vietnamese restaurants in the valley. This is always our go to spot for good pho and bun bo hue."}
{"text":"I  this place. Where else can you get a massive (I mean death star sized) bowl of Pho for $5.50? The food is really good and the atmosphere is busy, often seemingly cafeteria style, but seriously, who cares. The food is great and you'll never have a complaint."}
{"text":"I came here recently with a friend and we ordered chicken egg rolls (thinking it's going to be fried) and they gave us chicken spring rolls with this raw uncooked wrapping. We told the staff we wanted egg rolls not spring rolls but they then told us they don't have chicken egg rolls.. I also didn't like how the staff that work there seem like they are angry... They should lighten up and greet their customers with a smile."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant for foods and price, and services are good. The 2 things that I notice recently is the expansion of the restaurant and they have a new addition to the menu, that is called \"bun mang vit\" a specialty from Central Vietnam, which is duck soup in vermicelli and the dipping sauce is ginger based. This dish tastes good away from the typical Pho. They need a bigger parking space, maybe in the back of the building that needs some repaving."}
{"text":"I'm from California & I remembered about this restaurant the last time I visited Arizona 5 years ago.   Actually about 5 years ago, I remembered this Pho Thanh was originally called Pho Phuong Hoang. Even though it was 5 years since my last visit to Arizona, I still remember the restaurant named Pho Phuong Hoang because back then, Pho Phoung Hoang is the BEST pho I ever ate in any state in the United States ever; if I were to Yelp Pho Phuong Hoang, I gave them a Perfect 5/5.   However, this year, when an opportunity allows me to come back to visit Arizona, I swing by your place... I still remembered the Pho Phuong Hoang restaurant, which located nextdoor to that small Vietnamese supermarket in Camelback Road. But, when I saw your restaurant, Pho Phuong Hoang was bankrupt & gone. :(   Instead, a new pho restaurant took over which is called your Pho Thanh.   Of course, I am openminded to give it a try, hoping to see if Pho Thanh is as good as your predecessor: Pho Phuong Hoang.   Unfortunately, after tasting your restaurant Pho Thanh, I'm sorry to say that your pho restaurant is not as good as your predecessor Pho Phuong Hoang did.   Here are my list of pros & cons to why your Pho Thanh only earned a 3 star:   Pros:  -Food is cheap & inexpensive, which is good  -Large variety in your menu to choose from  -Good size proportions for the bowl of pho & Com Tam dishes.  -Timing of the service of the food is good; especially the Com Tam dish came out first before the pho, which is how a good Vietnamese restaurant supposed to be. -Place is more spacious than the original Pho Phuong Hoang   Cons:  -Your pho broth is slightly diluted & start losing the flavor. More details about the pho, the meats are supposed to be sliced not too thin nor too thick--yours is sliced too thin; need to be at least 0.5-1 mm in slicing size. Also needs more cilantro to garnish the pho. In addition, the way Pho Phuong Hoang does it that I gave them a high score is that WITHOUT request, when they serve pho, they also AUTOMATICALLY serve a plate of sliced onions doused in vinegar.  -Com Tam: The meat is slightly dry. Try to baste the meat more while your grilling; this allows the meat to absorb the marinate juice as you're grilling in the heat & it will result the meat to be nice & moist which makes it soft & tender.   Sorry Pho Thanh, I thought you were as good as your predecessor Pho Phuong Hoang, unfortunately not good enough. Though you can catch up to be better than your predecessor by following my suggestions listed in the Pros/Cons section above.   Overall, you earned a 3/5 stars from me. Still have a lot of work to do. Good luck with your business."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh has really good pho seasoned with Band-Aids at the bottom of the bowl.. Rather than giving the whole meal for free, the guy had to ask the manager if he could take off just ONE bowl of pho. I'm writing this for my dad who didn't know he could write a review.. I just wish he knew of something more to do at the time because that's the most disgusting thing I could think of"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place I crave it!! I get the veggie pho with tofu sooo bomb fresh herbs and fast service this place always busy which is a good sign! Always good!"}
{"text":"First off, I would like to humbly say, I eat Pho monthly, if not weekly.  Whether that be homemade or at a sit down, I slurp it frequently.  Ironically, as the business name might suggest, I actually do not come here for the Pho.  My food instinct tells me the root problem lies in the broth.  Not enough beefy, meaty flavors.  You can throw as much cooked meat into a bowl of Pho but that doesn't make the broth better, in addition to the excess oily content.  There's definitely room to improve!  Aside that, there are plenty of other dishes here that are very satisfying and evidently keeps me coming back.   ** BBQ Pork Banh Mi (Bun Me): If you ever had a Chinese Char Siu Bun, it's basically the same thing but in a baguette with fresh vegetables.  The bun is slightly toasted and served warm.  Definitely, a  winner in my book.  ($2.50)   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ruAAr86Q1SOeE8ovHHUhRA  ** Beef Stew with Banh Mi: The stew broth is fantastic! Lots of flavor from the beef!  Just exactly how I would like it! Take a piece of bread, dip, soak in the broth, and eat away! Yum! (Under $6)  ** Bun Bo Hue: Besides Pho, this is typically one of the other go-to soup bowls.  Don't let the redness in the soup or the pork blood scare you, its the reason why its good! Ha, ha! The best part is eating the bone-in pig skin and meat. (Under $6)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=aHJ6RhEArYbl4194Z6c-Sg  ** Luc Lac w/ a side of White Rice: French inspired pan seared steak and salad.  The awesome flavors that is fused with the caramelized onions paired with fresh, crisped salad drenched in special, citrus vinaigrette.  Caveat: a tad oily, but it's fine!  When you hear it SIZZLING on a hot, stoned plate is when you know it's good! ($9)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=dxw6_gLECBo-fOFNvQImng  ** Ca Ri Ga (Chicken Curry and Potato): If you like curry, you will most definitely enjoy this.  It's basically a soup bowl of brothy chicken with yellow curry and potato.  Similar to the Beef Stew, you can order it with a Banh Mi (baguette), OR have it with Vermicelli noodles or White Rice.  I would go with a warm, toasted baguette, so you can dip, soak the curry and eat it in small parts. (Under $6)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ok5oYmXE3cIQ3vfJl8gRXQ  These are just some of my favorites that I get here, but you can certainly order much more on their extensive menu.  I stick with what I know and like, typically.  The most important element of this place is the pricing! For lunch, its hard to beat!  The service is okay, they always start you off with a cold, ice water with lemon and then take your order after a few minutes of being seated.  Lastly, if you crave desserts, they are refrigerated and visible as you come up to pay for your meal.   If you are lucky enough to work around or twelve minutes away (like I do), I highly recommend getting your Viet fix here."}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered large Pho, took about 20 mins to have my Pho served. Served large portion which is good, because I'm extremely hungry. Took a couple of scoops, that was done for me. The Pho here is definitely sucks. This is not the taste you will find at a good pho restaurant. They added too much sugar to make the broth taste sweet instead of using real beef bone. If you are vietnamese pick something else to eat. Not coming back."}
{"text":"The deal:  - Great pho and other menu items. I had vegetarian pho with tofu that was top-notch.  - CHEAP. I think our entire meal (2 entrees, 1 app, tax+tip) was $13.  - Not very clean, and the staff could use some lessons in this area -- a couple of qualms we had were:  The guy bussing tables doesn't think twice about dousing a table with Windex while customers are eating their meals a few feet away.  Not cool. I imagine this is a bad habit that needs to be remedied, rather than an isolated occurrence.  I personally hate smelling chemicals while I'm eating.  Also, the same guy wheeled around a filthy cart full of customers' dirty dishes, and parked the thing just inches from me while I was eating. He never seems to empty the cart, just continues wheeling it around until it is overflowing with nasty remnants of meals. It was covered in crusty sauce (as if it's never been washed) and contains mounds of discarded food. It just looked gross. I tried ignoring it as it sat an arm's-length from me, but it quashed my appetite to some extent.   Bottom line: I'll likely go back for a cheap, quick Viet meal, and will hope that the minor infractions I pointed out here get resolved."}
{"text":"Went again two days ago and the whole place got BRIGHTER! I thought I was tripping but I then realized that they knocked the wall down and expanded next door. Their restaurant capacity doubled, I gotta say it feels kind of weird at first since the decors don't match.  Anyway, on to the food. Got a No.11 again and my friend got 14 with eggrolls.   ...  same old deliciousness with the same price. Nothing else to say about that.  I do want to add a piece of advice: go eat in clothes that you don't mind smelling like the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I come here mainly when I am craving bo nuong vi.  It's so inexpensive and so delicious!  It's definitely a meal that needs to be shared with at least 1 other person.  Their pho and rice dishes are also delicious.  I haven't had a bad meal here yet.  Their service is not that great, but considering it's a hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant, you can't expect 5 star service.  That's just how it is.  The restaurant is also quite large but come on a weekend for lunch or for dinner any night of the week, you'll probably expect a wait - but not a long one."}
{"text":"Nothing beats homemade pho but this comes pretty close.  It is the best pho that I've had in Phoenix and super cheap."}
{"text":"This place deserves 4 stars because their options are limitless! There are so many options to choose from that I took a while to pick my order. You could I was overwhelmed by the amount of options they had. I wanted to try everything! They even have desserts too but it's not in the menu but at the register.   Oh! And their prices are great!  For my order, I got beef and meatball pho and pork and shrimp spring roll. The pho was good. The noodles were super soft! However, I just felt that my broth was missing a little bit of something... it could be because I got meatball in it so that had something to do with the flavor. For the price of $6.95 I can't complain tho! The spring roll was so cheap; it was only $2.50 for 2 pieces! I don't know if this is how it is supposed to be but the beef in the spring roll was a bit dry for me. The shrimp however was fine. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the price I paid for. I went on a Sunday night so it was pretty busy, most of the tables were filled up but I didn't need to wait.   The outside of the restaurant is dull looking and the inside is okay. However, the location is pretty nice only because it is literally right next to a boba place!"}
{"text":"My picky palate is not very adventurous.  That's why this year I resolved to eat more adventurously.  I've done a pretty good job so far, and now I have finally tried Pho/Vietnamese!  I'm really proud of myself!  We were originally going to Maxim, but they were closed so we found another place to try Pho.  It was really cold out, and a bowl of piping hot soup just sounded delightful.  We walked in and almost every table was full of Vietnamese couples and families.  There were a few other white people in there, but I took that as a good sign.  They wouldn't eat here if it wasn't good, right?  We found the last empty table and quickly seated ourselves.  Someone walked by and dropped menus off on our table like a ninja and we began reading through the foreign novel.  There were so many things on there, and at least half of them scared the crap out of me!  I stuck with my original intentions and got the Pho with the beef slices along with an order of egg rolls.    My egg rolls came out before the Pho and they were quite delicious.  I have no idea what was in them, but they were full of flavor and meaty goodness.  I gobbled them up pretty quickly.  Then came the Pho.  We got a couple GIANT bowls of steaming soup and a plate of garnish.  Now, keep in mind we had no idea how to really eat this, or what to do with all the stuff.  I just watched everyone else in the restaurant and figured it out that it's all personal preference.  I threw in a handful of bean sprouts, squeezed in some lemon, and squeezed in a spoonful or so of sriracha sauce.  My additions resulted in one delicious bowl of heart warming soup.  I scarfed most of the solid food down and sipped most of what was left of the broth.  Now I understand why everyone talks about Pho!  I love the level of customization and it really is the perfect remedy for whatever may ail you.  I can't wait to get some more!"}
{"text":"Great food and really cheap.   I've been coming here since 2000 back when I was at ASU, and it's still the top spot for Pho for me in the Valley of the Sun.  Here's one of my latest pig outs as I remember it.  Keep in mind I went with one other person.  3 coconuts (the guy will crack open the top and insert straw & spoon for you) Other places give you coconut juice from the bottle and add coconut meat(?) to it.  *ahem* Da Vang *ahem*  If you've never had fresh coconut before, now is the time.  Natural Gatorade & oh so much better for you.  Plus, you can scrape the meat off the sides with your straw and suck them into your mouth.  Yes, you may use the spoon also, but it's not as fun. :D  2 orders of #11, the obligatory combination Pho. Need I say more?    1 Bahn Mi with combination meats Their Bahn Mi is awesome!  They've changed it up a bit, and for the better!  They used to have thin slices of pickled daikon and carrot, but now they have big sticks of them in the sandwich.  Order one with your Pho.  You can dip the fresh french roll right into the soup and chomp down on the combination of Vietnamese sandwich meats at their finest.    1 order of spring rolls I like how their rolls taste always fresh, not like how they seemed to have been rolled and kept in the fridge.  I think the very high turn over rate they have here helps  1 order of egg rolls.  All that came out to 25 dollars and something cents! I actually misunderstood the cashier and thought he had said forty five, but considering the amount of food we had at the table, I didn't even question it.  But seeing the number total on the register hit me as I was surprised it was so cheap!  I've had their pork chop w/egg rice plates as well, and they're an awesome option for people who do not like the so-called \"smell or scent\" of Pho.    PS:  Vietnamese restaurants usually all close on Tuesdays.   It's pretty smart since it really IS the slowest day for restaurants."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh  Arrived on a Saturday about 1:30pm and small parking lot was full, waited a few minutes and got a space when someone was leaving.  Restaurant was completely full but as people arrived, someone were leaving so there was really no wait.  If you are looking for a fancy Pho / Noodle / Asian food, definitely don't come here, this is no frills, blue collar, minority, hole in the wall, inexpensive.  But I enjoyed this place very much. Order quickly because they bring it out quickly and turn your table, then you go to stand up in line to pay.  They don't bring you a check, you go to the area where the sign says pay here and tell them what table # you were at.  We ordered the following -  #15 Pho Tai name sliced beef and beef brisket - $6.45  #26 Mi Hoanh Thanh Egg Noodles Soup  with pork wontons, shrimp, squid, pork, fish meatballs and a quail egg - $7.45  Bowls are good size and will certainly fill you up. Very good broth filled with lots of meat, shrimp, wonton and pork.  Don't forget to leave some room to go next door to Milk Run.  Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho house in Phoenix. We actually ate it two nights in a row. Spring rolls are amazing. The pho broth is full of spice and flavor. Plus the portion size is huge!!! Just delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here today because I missed the OCT 2015 International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (UYE).  Norm R was right.  This place has the best Pho in Phoenix.   This place is situated in a nondescript strip mall of Asian inspired shops.  I have literally passed it a dozen times and have never noticed it.    it looks like a bingo hall on the inside with these tables with numbers on them.  Fluorescent lights lining the drop ceiling and rectangle folding (-like) tables with 6 or 8 chairs at most of them.  The Pho is relatively inexpensive.  I didn't realize, ordering the oxtail Pho, that I was ordering one of the most expensive things on the menu at $12.  I am one of those weirdos who order Pho for the broth and the beef.  I'm indifferent about the noodles and rarely eat much of them.  The broth here is the best I've had in Phoenix.   This was a warm treat on a chilly rainy day.   The place was packed too.  I was surprised, but then maybe not.  It was a rainy cool day in PHoenix.  Who wants to be out?  Apparently others had the same thoughts as I, let's get Pho!  Return factor: 90%"}
