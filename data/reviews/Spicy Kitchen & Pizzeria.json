{"text":"Excellent Curry! The chicken tikka and butter chicken are both great. Good prices! Friendly and clean. Super takeout spot. A few tables to eat in but pretty small"}
{"text":"Excellent for fusion Indian food, food is bit on the milder side, ask for extra spice if you are used to regular indian dishes. Overall staff was very pleasant and responsive in getting other condiments and spices upon request."}
{"text":"Recently read about this place, all the reviews seem to indicate positive experiences. I drove past a week ago, glanced in and noticed it was small and they don't have much room to dine in. There is also no website available to look up their menu (Except here in yelp there is a pic of it).  It also looks like they are mainly focused on Facebook followers and creating a social buzz.  Tonight was one of those lazy \"let's just order in some pizza\" nights. I don't know if they deliver (again, no info or website or menu) but, with choices such as Tandoori and Butter Chicken pizza's, why not pick up....and so we did!  The specialty pizza was only available in Medium @ $16.50 ea, However, we were told we can up size to a large for an additional $7 dollars. We decided on 2 mediums rather than the 1 large for the small difference and we get to try more.  We ordered the Tandoori pizza which had a variety of Indian flavors and spice, Note:this pizza packs a punch...personally, i enjoyed the heat. The Butter Chicken pizza was milder in terms of spice and the toppings were also quite tasty, not as aggressive of a flavor.  We also tried their potato Samosa's which were quite good (2 for a dollar) they had a soft yet crispy crust on them which made it easy to snack on.  Surprisingly, I did not like the pizza crust, I was was very bland and dry. It even looks the part. One of our pizza's were overcooked which further detracts from the crust. I would encourage them to find a better crust that would compliment their very tasty ingredients.  I am under the impression their strengths are with the Indian foods and not the pizza. So far, I found SK to be a nice change from the ordinary, but I did not have anything extraordinary so far.  I am certainly interested in returning when looking for a change from the regular. Will be back to try the Indian dishes, see you soon!"}
