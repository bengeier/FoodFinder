{"text":"I love middle-eastern food and was looking forward to trying Aladdin's to see how it compared to some other favorites.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  They make an effort to make a connection from the outset.  It was slightly suffocating, but the intentions were good, so I can't fault them on that at all.  The menu is decent with a number of different staples included, but some were noticeably missing, like Moussaka.  Either way, there were some great choices.  We ordered our food and they brought over our pita to start.  The pita was served inside of a ziploc bag.  Weird.  Was the bag reused?  Had it been used to store left-overs at some point, do they wash it between uses?  We'll never know, but it was strange.  The entree was pretty good.  Flavorful, good presentation, etc.  It wasn't the best middle eastern food I've ever had, but it was still good.  Desert portions are tiny.  If you like baklava order 2 portions...or 3.  Seriously, it's a small portion."}
{"text":"Best Tabouli in Alberta. Drove all the way from Fort McMurray to try it. Was not disappointed. Great food, awesome service and amazing environment...Will be making stopping here every time I'm in Calgary"}
{"text":"I am here regularly with friends and family. When I say regularly I mean 2-3 times a month. The food is amazing I can't get enough, service is great Sandra is always a pleasure. This family owned and run business is one of my favorites in Calgary. Bonus, they serve shisha after dinner and have multiple flavors! I highly recommend this place if you're looking to dine at a slower pace, you don't feel rushed at all. Food is fresh to serve! I will continue to come back!! And to add to their greatness they have belly dancers on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Ordered for pick up, I got few pieces of chicken thrown in the take out container with a soggy piece of bread or I should say \"half a piece\". Same thing with the Shish Kabab, and for the price u pay for that!! Not worth it. Oh, n I got a couple pieces of Baklava in the bag which I thought is a nice gesture to find out soon enough they're so cold, dry n stale! Apparently they just wanted to get rid of them n that's exactly what I did! I would never recommend this place to anyone, NEVER!"}
{"text":"This place has no doubt, absolutely delicious food - every single time I have been here the food is served extremely fresh and hot especially the foods that have meat in them. Their food is mouthwatering delicious.   Service can sometimes be slow which is a downside because it seems like you have to have a full free day with nothing else to do sometimes due to the wait time. Another factor that makes them lose a star is that their prices are pretty high, there are similar places downtown that serve the same type of foods for about $10 per platter. It's not the closest restaurant to go to and for that reason I think they should adjust their prices accordingly because that alone would bring them many more clients."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year now and their quality of food never fails. It's always cooked to perfection.   The owners are friendly, humble and truly professional. If you're into hookah - then their evening and nighttime entertainment is definitely worth checking out.   I rank this place a 10/10 for quality of food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"When I first was recommended to try Alladin, I didn't believe the couple when they talked about the mouth watering grilled tenderloin and chicken. Until I tried it out for myself and now we are the weird couple that rant and rave about the dinner at Alladin. Excellent dinner and they also have great entertainment with a belly dancer and live musician on Saturday nights. However if you are not into sheesha, it might not be the place for you. We are! so I always order white grape-mint, if you haven't tried it, I recommend you do."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night,and the restaurant was booked with reservations. I told the Hostess that we were fast eaters, and she accommodated us as long as we were done by 7:30. It was six so we had plenty of time to eat. They start you with a small plate with pickled radishes, hot peppers, and olives. Also a warm basket of Pita's. I orderd the shish Kabob, which comes with either fries or rice. When it comes out it has a couple of pieces of pita, onion, and a parsley/onion combo. The beef kabobs are really tender and nicely seasoned. The rest was also equally good. My wife had a salad which really tasty as well. We also tried the hummus, which was very creamy. Just make sure you have some gum or mints after as it is quite garlicky. When we were done our meal, we were asked how everything was, and my wife had told the waiter how much she enjoyed the olives. We  had a couple of things put in Styrofoam containers as we didn't finish the salad, and the hummus. In the way out to the car, we noticed three containers in the to go bag, and to my wife's surprise the waiter threw in some olives on the house.  It was a nice touch. It's little things like that, and the attention to detail that we like about businesses. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst Sheesha place and restaurant ever  We were a group of seven and we asked for sheeshas, appetizers and drinks , but our server said we all have to order main course as well, or they won't serve us anything !!!!!and she was the rudest waitress ever. I've been living in Calgary for the past 3 years and I've never seen such bad service  , I was always able to order what ever I want in a restaurant, except this place ."}
{"text":"A friend has been singing praises to this restaurant for a long time, so I decided to give it try. The restaurant is very clean and easy on the eye. Service is extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. The food is nothing short of delicious. I had the Kebi Nayi, which was freshly prepared to order and oh my it was good! The Tabouli and the Hommos were delicious as well My daughter loved the shrimp. Thumbs Up to this one, coming back for more"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Dont let the wierd l Disco lights confuse or scare you. The food is incredible."}
{"text":"Almost seven months since my last review of Aladdin's Casbah and another five star experience. Woo hoo! I'm seriously blown away by how much I love this restaurant.  The service is some of the best I've had anywhere. You can really tell that everyone who works here takes pride in the business. I feel like they really care about their customers having a good time. I loved that one of the waitresses recognized my parents and made a point to follow-up with them about how a recent vacation had been.  The food is still fantastic. To my fellow vegetarians: the \"Aladdin's Delight\" is a great option. All but 2 of the 8 appetizers it comes with are veggie friendly (and to the best of my knowledge I think quite of few of them are vegan as well). However, if you mention to them that you don't eat meat, they have no problem swapping in a different veggie dish. By the time the kebabs arrive, you'll be too full to care anyway!  My two tips for those who want to try Aladdin's out: 1) Come on a Friday or Saturday night for the belly dancer. It's always a treat to have some entertainment. She doesn't start performing until around 9pm though so make sure to stick around until then. 2) Make a reservation! The place gets absolutely packed and it's no fun getting turned away at the door."}
{"text":"Each time I am here I am get great service and delicious food and shisha. I have never once been disappointed with the atmosphere, the staff or what was placed in front of me. A great place for a nice date or spending time with friends and family."}
{"text":"Excellent food every time we've been. Fresh pita, pickled turnips are great, love the tabouli and labneh. All the skewers are delicious. Love the kefta.  If you are unfamiliar with middle eastern food it is similar to Greek but better."}
{"text":"5 Star Experience always, the best Lebanese Food I have ever had including better than any home cooked Lebanese Food from going to my Lebanese Friends homes. I recommend the mixed grill if your not sure what you feel like, but if you are there in a group they offer platters where you sample many of the traditional appetizers and main courses. My favourite is the shish tawook, the chicken Breast cubes flame grilled, in my top 10 best dishes ever. Served with your choice of rice, fries, or salad. The Fries are steak cut and taste great with their Homemade Garlic Sauce, my choice. And the evening is never finished without a nice relaxing hookah. Great food, great hookah, and great service! A family business, where they take pride in the quality, and service!"}
{"text":"First time in Calgary, friend of ours recommended this place, party of eight, all were satisfied & happy. Food was delicious,best kabob ever, chicken was our favorite, so juicy & tender. Appetizers were so tasty as well. svc & staff were super friendly & fast. Next time we're bck in Calgary for sure stopping by."}
{"text":"Went in on friday night. Waitress greeted us asked for reservation I said I have none. Should have seen her face as if I interrupted her. Gave us a table after  5 minutes wait. They were short staffed for friday night for sure. Restaurant was pretty fool so i presume good food. As we dis not have any as we were ledt hanging with the me u and no one came to take our order for good 15 minutes. So we left."}
{"text":"Food was slow for service to the tables... 1 hrs for apps. And another 30-45 for dinner...  Music was way too loud for dinner...   Super disorganized service... For large parties, separate the bill to each attendee as it makes paying in the end easier. When the customer asks you to do that, do it!  This is the second time I have come to this restaurant and it is all the same..  The food was good and tasty..but service and time for delivery to the table was the worst part..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but it was the first for many in my group last night. Overall, an excellent experience. The food is amazing and cooked to perfection. The staff are friendly and go the extra mile. The music is always a hit.   I gave them only 4 stars because the service usually gets scattered as soon as it gets busy and when the entertainment starts. Not a deal breaker but it's always nice to not have to track your waiter down for the bill or desert. They're usually so busy by this time of night- so it's also very understandable.   It's still one of my favourite restaurants!"}
{"text":"The food is probably the best Lebanese I have tried in Calgary. But the service can sometimes be patchy.   Always call to make sure they are open and are not hosting any private parties or,.."}
{"text":"Was visiting Calgary from Florida and have to say it was an amazing restaurant. Food was good, but service was spectacular! Sandra and Summer were very courteous, and really took their time to cater to my friend and I. The hookah was good, but I would personally just stick to the food and coffee"}
{"text":"Wish I came to Aladdin's often, the food is the best. I don't eat meat often, so I tried the Jumbo Shrimp dish which was so good. They were big, biggest shrimp I have ever seen. Big as lobster tails. You have to try it, served with garlic sauce on the side and rice or fries. It was worth the price. Nice place to eat."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. The service is great; really has a cozy family-owned feel. The product knowledge adds to this as well.   I would say this is a bit expensive, but the quality and quantity of food makes it worth it. Treat yourself."}
{"text":"I've come here twice and each time I have thoroughly enjoyed it, spent hours lounging and socializing with friends over hookah and never feel rushed. The food! Mmm only thing that can compare to a truly enjoyable discussion while puffing like the caterpillar in \"Alice's\" tale. Whether it is frogs legs or chicken, prawns or beef the chef knows the exact time to take it off! I mean it. The food is exact. The sauce, the cooking, the freshness of the ingredients - attention to detail here. My one complaint? The pita bread was in a bag. Not sure what this was about. The staff are friendly and make you feel at home. Do not let the prices or the formality of the place intimidate you. It feels comfortable and tastes divine."}
{"text":"Great show!! And the food is very good as well ... The service is not the best.. As is always very busy... But the show and the ambience make the visit be worthy!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. Fresh, flavourful, and unique food served in a good environment. It was really quiet when I was in but the service was great and friendly. I will be back again."}
{"text":"We had a great experience going here the staff was wonderful they helped up with our choices and we ordered the Kings plater and it was amazing !  I personally loved the garlic sauce and I tried it with everything !  This is a great place to try Lebanese cuisine."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this restaurant for the proximity to the movie theatre, but will have to return just for the food! We decided to do several appetizers as share plates, instead of an entree each...mainly because of the variety of cold and hot appetizers sounded more delicious than the entrees. We left incredibly full and very satisfied with every dish that was flavourful and well presented. The service was friendly and although the restaurant was pretty quiet on a Sunday evening when we arrived just after 5pm, it was soon filled with chatter from nearby tables. Looking at the entrees from nearby tables, the entrees looked quite large and tasty...I'll have to try one next visit!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious kabab!! The belly dancers are always a nice touch!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 10 guests on a Friday night for 7pm, 2 guests were coming later due to other commitments and would be joining us. Upon entry we were approached by a female server whom I later discover is the owners daughter/waitress (ODW) who asks if we have a reservation. My friend replies yes, for 10 people but 2 of them will arrive later and her response is \"well is it for 8 or 10 people? because your reservation was for 10.\" Strike one lady.  That's not how you speak to customers, whether it was for 8 or 10 the reservation was for 10, and as such a table of 10 SHOULD be set up, it wasn't and we were lead to a table of 8.  I would like to mention that at 7pm there were only 6 tables in the restaurant occupied.  As the rest of the group came in we had ordered some beverages and sheesha.  Between 8 people we had 5 sheeshas followed by canned pop- I would never consider pop in cans as fine dining, sorry.  ODW comes back after a while and asks if we are ordering apps.  Half of the party declined the apps as they were ordering meals and starter salads (TO START, AS AN  APP) again, she provided attitude, repeatedly asked if we wanted hummus to start or a sampler platter.  We all felt it was pretty aggressive, especially since some of the guests in our party did order apps for sharing!   About 40 min later we order our meals, and my friend next to me asked for extra garlic which she was later charged $8 for.  Its well past 8:30 and after 45min elapses one of our guests inquires when the food was coming out as she had to leave by 10:00.  We get a scripted, \"sorry the kitchen is behind, your meals are out next\" response from ODW and she proceeds to tell the 2 other tables behind us the same thing, the restaurant was not even half full. Finally the meals are served at 9:30, the same time the belly dancer starts. THANKS! Great timing there. Strike 2- it should not take 2.5 hours to get a meal served.  The salads were fine. Those who ordered the chicken said it was good but the party host noted it was a strange texture, almost rubbery.  I took a small taste, and agreed; the texture reminded me of the boxed chicken you can get for $25 pre-portioned frozen in the boxes that are sold at Sobeys, its chicken but not the best quality chicken.  I ordered the \"tenderloin\" kebab skewer platter, I will not speculate as to whether it was tenderloin or not, but I know what good tenderloin is and this was not anywhere as good as I've had, regardless I ate about 3 chunks and maybe 4-5 of my side of frozen fries and none of the traditional veg.  Under the last 3-4 chunks of meat, I find a short black hair, about 2 inches long (my hair is about 10 inches long and basically blonde).  I politely get the young male waiters attention and he agrees thats not right and motions to ODW to deal with the situation and shes ready with excuses as to how the hair got there with zero apology or accountability.  Instead of promptly removing and offering to re-make the dish, like a fine dining establishment would, she denies it was HER hair or the kitchen staff hair and goes so far to say that it probably came from one of the vents or the dark haired patron sitting directly behind me and it somehow made its way UNDER THE MEAT.  I calmly tell her, no, not likely.  She counters with the COMICAL offer to replace the 2 pieces of meat that the hair was under OR comp me 5% OR give me a coffee and desert on her.  WOW really? coffee and a piece of baklava to replace a $40 meal?!  I say no, thats not right- I'm turned off by the entire exchange and just shake my head in utter disbelief.  She then aggressively takes my less than half finished plate and goes to the back, comes out again, and offers to make me another skewer but bye bye to the sides she tossed and she was doing me a favour making this skewer as \"we never comp meals here\" (PS I never asked for a comp, but an apology and remaking it sans hair would have been sufficient)  She brings a portion of 4 pieces of meat on a plate and to-go box and asks me to make sure there is no hair in a condescending tone, and a step further boasts this replacement costs her $16.  I decide she will receive $0 for a tip after this.   STRIKE 3. Who runs a business like this and why is this person at the front of the house? THIS is the kind of person you want representing you? Wow. Here's a bit of advice to the boss and his associates with the Tony Soprano table set up in the corner.  While you are all tending to whatever it is that you all were doing your waitress manager or whatever it is she is, is running your business into the ground. As evidenced by the filtered reviews-she is not doing you any favours.  Do as you please but know she has zero customer service skills. The restaurant has potential and the dancer was sensational, and if I wasn't with such a large group, I would have given the ODW a piece of my mind.  The zinger was the 18% auto gratuity already added to the bill as a final F YOU! Terrible!"}
