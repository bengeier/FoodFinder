{"text":"This place has delicious deli hoagies at fantastic prices! This place is easily overlooked but my boyfriend and I come for food 1-2 times a week. The best part is taco Tuesday! You can sit at the bar get a beer (or 2) and $1.00 per taco. There's minimal wait time and a true hometown feel. If you are hungry this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop to hang out in by Southside Works. I like it."}
{"text":"Cupka's Cafe II on East Carson Street gets all the attention, but this is the original Cupka's Cafe, tucked away on the corner of 27th and Jane.  (The sign outside says \"Cupka's Cafe\", the name \"Richard Cupka Deli\" is news to me.)

When I worked in the South Side Works, this became my favorite place to eat lunch, and the McCupka became my favorite hamburger to eat there.  Patty hand-molded from ground beef, \"special sauce\", lettuce, and a wonderful soft bun.  Since moving to New York I've been searching for it's equivalent but have yet to find it.

It's a small place, about four tables.  The woman who would wait on us was sweet and I feel guilty that I do know her name.  All the sandwiches are magnificent.  Make sure you are hungry before you go."}
{"text":"A nice surprise in South Side. Great food and terrific prices"}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a quick lunch. I just moved not too far from here, so it was a great break from unpacking and cleaning. The man who was working, Zorn, was very nice. He explained everything to me was so kind and friendly.. I'm talking goodbye handshake friendly. 

They serve 8 inch hoagies which are referred to as grinders. Each is $5 & served with homemade chips. There are around 15 to choose from and many combinations using normal hoagie toppings- ham, turkey, salami, capicola ect. after, you can choose your toppings at no extra charge such as l,t,o & a range of condiments including chipotle mayo. They have 2 hot grinders- meatball & hot sausage. The homemade chips were also yummy. They also have fries on their menu which comes In different flavors.

I ordered the turkey, bacon provolone grinder and was satisfied.

Oh, there's also a bar the we went to last night for a celebration drink. Twice in two days? Yeah I think we're gonna be regulars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little Deli's. For 5 dollars you get a giant grinder sub and a bag of home-made chips. I've had 7 of the different sandwiches here and they were all fantastic. The chef is one of the nicest guys around and such a pleasure to talk to. I highly recommend getting lunch here."}
{"text":"Matt is great! Exceptional service & good prices! Hidden gem. We are visiting from out of town and this place feels like a piece of home. Haven't tried the grinder but I'm sure we'll be back again soon."}
