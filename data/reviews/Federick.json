{"text":"Always good! Yes not the kinda place you go on a first date but definitely the place you go to when you want some good spicy portions!"}
{"text":"Had take-out from here several times and dined in on a number of occasions. Fairly standard Hakka Cuisine! Their service during lunch time hours is quick. There are a number of Hakka restaurants in the area that are comparable to the food quality here."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally eat at Fedricks especially after hearing so much about it but sadly I was quite disappointed. I ordered  munchurian fried rice,  chicken fried rice,  chilli chicken and munchurian chicken. The munchurian rice was by far the most disappointing, the rice was wet and flavorless. Overall every dish I ordered lacked flavor. I have tried my fair share of hakka restaurants in Toronto and I would rate Fedricks as one of  the worst.   However, to my surprise the interior was very nice, maybe they recently renovated. I went on a Monday night and it wasn't overly crowded and it was quiet. Also the service was pretty good, our waitress was really nice and joked around."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for almost 10 years now. We always order the chilli chicken, mixed fried rice, beef with broccoli, garlic shrimp. The food is spicy, but quite  greasy at times. They need to expand the restaurant and give it a makeover! But, this is still my favourite hakka indian chinese restaurant in toronto!"}
{"text":"Amazing food from an amazing restaurant.  These guys win awards for a reason.  Service can get a little tricky around lunch and diner but for how busy they get its totallly understandable. Chicken Pakora, Chili Chicken, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and some Wonton Soup, so good for such a great price."}
{"text":"Went during lunch hours, though it was not busy, most of the waitress was cleaning other tables, did not bother to greet us  ! Once we sat down, did not get the menu for five minutes. We ordered for Chill chicken dry and fried rice, but we got the wrong order. then had to wait another 10 minutes for the chicken to come, but by that time egg fried became cool. Chill chicken  tasted awful. my Chili chicken had an essence of garlic taste. Egg fried rice was too \"fried\" had no taste ! the food did not look very appealing. Worst Experience ! Not to order chilli chicken from here !"}
{"text":"Newly renovated, however take out is always the best option!   Hot and soup soup is delish and filling.  Can never say no to the best chili chicken ever! I always eat it by itself, no rice.  Their chicken pakoras are good. I never knew I liked pakoras until I tried theirs.  General Tao chicken is yummy, definitely better than other places.   I would suggest ordering over the phone and than picking it up as there is very little space inside and there is always people coming and going."}
{"text":"Best hakka restaurant ever! I tried them all and none come even close to Frederick. The first time I ever heard of Frederick I thought it was a burger joint based on the name alone. Then I went inside and the rest was history. This location is the original spot to eat with buddies after work or just for take out. The menu is huge and the prices are really fair. They give big portions so when I go in a group I usually mix different plates to share. You have to experience all the delicious variety type of dishes/plates. This is a classic joint and i promise you will love it as well.   Fave dish: MANCHURIAN CHICKEN NOODLES"}
{"text":"Came here with a buddy to try out their take on Hakka food. Got chili chicken, fish pakora,  and mixed fried rice. Taste was pretty good. Although I thout the chili chicken was a bit too salty for my liking. Fish pakora was good... But I think Lin garden's was a tad better. Price point wise... Was on par. Good value for your money."}
{"text":"This place used to be the benchmark of Hakka food. Now I can officially say I will never eat here again. The shrimp pakoras are soggy, the manchurian fried rice smelled spoiled and the chilli chicken was mushy. What a disappointment. Don't eat at this place.  It sucks!  Try Lin gardens or spicy dragon."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend and I'm grateful she showed me this place. Food was amazing, very fresh and the portions were huge. Also the servers are nice and great to talk to."}
{"text":"The bad: 1.) The service could be a lot better! I think little things go a long way with customers. For example checking in a couple of times to see how things are going would be nice. We were waiting a good 15mins before I had to get up to get the desert menu and to have our plates cleared  I had to walk over and call the waiter.  2.)   The Good:  1.) Cheap food  2.) food arrived fast  3.) short wait to be seated (even on Boxing Day)"}
{"text":"Staff is rude. Its almost as if they are so busy, they forgot about customer service. I ordered a Manchurian Chicken to go. Bland! It had no salt!!!. Don't ever let an establishment treat you poorly and serve you crap. Not worth my money."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch and was seated super quickly with no wait. Lunch specials are 5.75 for smaller (but still decent) portion size and a drink.   Got the chili chicken lunch special and shrimp pakoras. Chili chicken was served with white rice, which offset the spiciness nicely. Really tasty and filling and not too salty. Shrimp pakoras were made from shrimp paste and I couldn't really tell if there was any actual shrimp inside. There were also chilies deep fried in them, which made them extra spicy. I prefer the shrimp pakora from Lin Garden as it's essentially a whole shrimp that's battered and deep fried and has a better flavour.   They include a 10% gratuity for dine-in. Service wasn't as bad as others have commented. Our water was always full, which is my usually standard, so I was pleased. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Federicks is a classic Hakka Chinese staple in Scarborough.   I have been going to Federicks for 5 years. The food is good and keeps me wanting to come back. It is the local restaurant that is not known for it's big restaurant feel inside or outside. The dining room looks like it is in need of a major renovation. The service is okay. The servers/waiters are quick and to the point (no real chatter and or upselling that they try to do with you).   Some key notes about Federick. It is busy on the weekends, be forewarned. They have a dedicated take out window in between the front door and the entrance to the dinning room. If you are going to get take out, be sure to call ahead and order to avoid line ups. Parking can get packed on the weekends and the location can often be passed as it is located in small place next to TD Bank.   The food is reasonable priced and won`t break the bank.   My recommendations are the Chili Chicken and Shanghai noodles.   If you are in Scarborough and like Hakka Chinese -- def worth a try."}
{"text":"The food was descent, but the service was horrible. It took a half an hour to get our second entree. This is not acceptable."}
{"text":"It was terrible....I went after I saw a 4 star rating but my experience was horrible. Will never ever go back again. Service wasn't great...the manchurian gravy was very very bitter. Ah awful."}
{"text":"My Hakka resto experience so far consists of Lin Garden and China Cottage.  Always heard that Federick was a good restaurant but finally got a chance to try it.  My friend decided to come here with her wedding party for a dinner and ordered a bunch of dishes including: - chicken pakoras - shrimp fried rice - chicken fried rice - hakka noodles - lemon chicken - Manchurian shrimp - Manchurian chicken - Chilli chicken  Each of the dishes came in large portions.  Two orders of chicken pakora were enough to feed a table of 15 adults.  The pakoras were not greasy, were meaty and gave a good kick.  Coming from a Canton-Chinese background, I often judge Chinese food (especially the fried rice and noodle dishes which often originate from Canton) by its wok flavour.  I thought the fried rice and the noodles had some nice flavour (although not as strong as the actual Canton food resto's)  The lemon chicken was nothing special but then again, it's because I'm picky about my Chinese food.  The Manchurian shrimp and chicken were good but not memorable or special.  I can only eat spice in moderation but I didn't find the chilli chicken overly spicy compared to the other restaurants.  Another reviewer mentioned that the chilli chicken could use some more spice and I think it's a fair comment, otherwise it would just be soy sauce chicken.    The restaurant itself isn't very large.  We came on a Thurs night.  At 5:30 the restaurant was half full.  By 6:00, all the tables were taken.  Turnover was quick, with the restaurant at full capacity still by the time we left just after 7.  Luckily, the staff are quick and efficient, which is why they were able to turn tables around so quickly.  Like the normal Chinese restaurants, the dishes came out fast, fresh and hot soon after ordering.  The only negative that I can readily point out is that I walked out smelling like the restaurant, most likely due to our close proximity to the kitchen.    Frederick is not a fancy restaurant but offers wholesome food at good prices.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"Had the hot and sour soup and white meat chilli chicken.... everyone that knows haka food knows that it's all about the soya sauce flavor when it comes to chili chicken and let's just say it was less than flavorful. Not sure if it was due to the white meat however, the sauce was bland and amateur..."}
{"text":"Parking Parking lot with free parking. Not much many spots.  Decor  Restaurant is clean and cozy. There is a separate area for take out orders which is very convenient for people waiting. Less clutter in the dining area.    Service Very friendly and attentive. The service was the reason I did not give this place 1 star.  Food VERY greasy. This is not typical of Hakka dishes...the fried chili chicken was good however, everything else was sub par. I felt like I was dining in a cheap Chinese buffet. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The chili chicken! Always good to get and addictive. Been here a couple of times. They renovated so it looks a lot better than before. Still busy as ever.  It's a good place to order take-out or dine-in for a fast, quick, meal to satisfy your hakka food needs/cravings. Service was good of all the times I've been here. If you're expecting stellar service all the time, I wouldn't count on it. Maybe go for the take-out instead; still pretty good portions to go.  It's my go-to Hakka restaurant for a quick bite. Parking can be a nightmare though. There's more space in the back, but it's a tight squeeze in the front."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE  Yes it is very small and busy, but the food is amazing. We got the chilli chicken, Manchurian chicken and hakka chow mein. They were all very delicious and brought out very fast"}
{"text":"The food is super greasy. Sometimes it taste great and other times, it's just alright. I've only ordered takeout so I'm not sure about dining in. They get really busy so they might not answer the phone. Sometimes the food will come really quick, other times you've gotta wait. I've never waited more than 20 minutes though."}
{"text":"This a great restaurant for fast pick up. We normally get the chilli chicken which is typically very spicy. We ask them to tone it down a bit cause kids are eating as well. There normally very good at this. We also get chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken balls, and sweet corn chicken soup on cold winter nights that warms Ya right up! It is a very reasonably priced restaurant and the place is very busy. Food is prepared quickly so you don't have to wait long. You can also call ahead and pick it up.  When you pick up your order and pay cash you save 10%. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Food is good and spicy, service is cold.  Went there for the first time in February during a snow storm. The restaurant was pretty much empty except for my group and two other tables. We ordered and got our food fast. It was good and spicy. Throughout the night, the wait staff kept rushing us out of the restaurant. They took our dinner plates while we were barely finished, and dropped us the cheque while we had 60% of our dishes remaining on the table!  When I asked to keep the receipt after we paid, the waitress gave us the b---- face.  I don't understand why they kept rushing us out when there was no one else in the restaurant.  Good food, BAD service. Go for the takeout, not the dine-in.  Would NOT recommend, would NOT visit again."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. I love Hakka - Chinese food, and I hadn't had any in a while, so I was really craving some spicy goodness! I came here with high hopes for a delicious dinner, and left with the bitter taste of disappointment and bad food in my mouth.   We ordered the chili chicken, fish pakoras, and \"famous\" corn soup, which everyone recommends and seems to love. My mouth was watering at the thought of the feast that awaited us. The corn soup arrived first, and it was basically semi coagulated jello with bits and chunks of crab and corn kernels. The crab was fishy, and although it was real crab, it tasted so damn fishy, I could hardly bring my self to swallow it. I'm still trying to erase the gelatinous memory of that soup from my mind.   The fish pakoras were OK. Pretty bland, and the fish inside was somewhat mushy and not seasoned at all. They weren't terrible, but not good either. In fact they were the only non terrible part of this meal.   The chili chicken. I almost cried when I tasted this. I absolutely love chili chicken, however their version of it was just a plain pathetic excuse of this dish. First of all, it had no spice at all, no heat, no kick! It was cold, as if it had been left out for a while before being served to us. The chicken wasn't lightly battered, and the sauce was basically just a stickier version of soya sauce. It had no onions, and I only found one single chili pepper in the entire thing. Terrible. In fact this was so bad, that I would have rather had Machu Wok than this. Sad :(   The waitress was rather rude and inattentive, but whatever. I could have experienced stellar service and it still wouldn't have made a difference. On the way out I saw a lot of newspaper clippings of all the press and praise this place has received. Really? I wonder what kind of people enjoy such mediocre food, but certainly not me. Won't ever be coming here again."}
{"text":"Looks like I am doing another Hakka restaurant review.  I decided to return to a restaurant that I haven't eaten at for 13 years simply because I forgot the name. Once I found out this was it, I had to go and see if nostalgia had the better of me or was it great indeed.  The Place: Clearly since being here last the restaurant does have a nice face lift. Parking is available, but much more at the back.  Experience: While it has a hole in the wall feel, it is a cult-favorite for a lot of people. It was packed but I was ready to wait. The staff was great, didnt write anything down but got everything correct; colour me impressed. Food did not take long to come out at all.  The Food: My date and I decided on the Shrimp Pakoras to start, Szechuan shrimp, Manchurian Chicken,  House Special Mixed Chow Mein.  I have to say, I forgot how much they give you... For the quality of the food, the quantity was as impressive. Food came out hot, delicious and spicy.  Due to the amount we could take this goodness home.  Conclusion: Visit them now."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food, but my family is and I've eaten it countless times throughout my life. I lived in Harlem, NY for a while and grew a love for Chinese food but couldn't find anything in Toronto that tasted as good until I came here. Comparing it to the many hakkas in Scarborough, such as Lin Garden, Hot Wok, Lucky's, Chinese Halal, etc. this is the best restaurant hands down! I don't know if It's because I'm pregnant why I eat their food all the time, but it tastes amazing compared to everywhere else. I would go once or twice a month, after my OB appointment lol. I haven't dined in, but I would love to. Their dine-in section is nicer than the other restaurants I mentioned. It's actually presentable and clean, but it takes up space from the take-out section lol. I saw in previous reviews that it isn't a place to have a first date, but they've renovated since then. Anyway, I don't usually rate things 5/5 but this place deserves it. Their service is great also. And they give you a discount for using cash. My favorite dish is the General Tao Chicken. I have yet to try the Chili Chicken and Chicken Pakora."}
{"text":"I went to Fredricks with the girlfriend on a Friday night right before we went to see a movie.   I've heard good things about this place from many friends and have wanted to try it out for quite some time but just haven't had the time to visit this part of the city.  At first appearance, there is nothing impressive from the outside. It is located in a desolate plaza but what is apparent is that those who visit the plaza often are in Fredricks themselves.  When walking in to Fredricks, I noticed that they have an individual area for takeout that is before the actual sitdown area itself. The lunch menu looks about the same as other Hakka places around the city but for $5.75 it sure beats the generic burger from McDonalds.   Upon entering, the first impression is that the restaurant is quite small. Probably seats about 25-30 at the most. We got a table right away and our table was clean and well setup. The napkin in the glass was a nice touch.   My one complaint is when restaurants leave the utensils on the table themselves. Not very sanitary but pretty standard in restaurants.  I ordered the Chilli Chicken & Chicken Pakoras and the GF ordered the General Tso chicken. All the dishes were excellent and were large portions. The one complaint here is that the restaurant is super stingy with the rice. You'd think given the portion sizes they would be a little more relaxed about giving away some rice.   The dishes were prepared quickly and tasted great. 5/5 here.   Now I'll get to why I didn't rate this place didn't get a higher rating from me. Firstly, the rice issue was a bit of a downer given that we ordered several dishes. To get one bowl of rice is not cool.   Secondly, the kitchen staff come out from time to time and sit down in the restaurant area and stare at the patrons eating the food. Not a glance, but full on staring. I caught 3 or 4 of the chefs watching me eat my food. Even with me making eye contact with them for several seconds they continued to stare. A bit uncomfortable but didn't stop me from eating my meal.   Overall, this is a great Hakka restaurant to try out, but I've definitely had better. The service was great, the food was great and the portions were plentiful.  I recommend you try it out sometime."}
{"text":"Federick is a great spot for lunch deals if you are in the Scarborough area. For less than $8, you can get yourself a main course with a carb and a drink (choice of pop or tea). The lunch menu itself has over 20 various options to choose from, catering to different preferences in taste. It's not Michelin star restaurant, but you'll be well-fed with decent food without breaking your wallet before you leave."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Hakka-Indo food the last time I was in TO and we dropped into Federick's.  It's been awhile since I've been here and they did a pretty good job at renovating it.  There was one dish and one dish only that I really wanted.  Chili chicken, dry and spicy!  We also ordered some Hakka noodles as well as mixture of pakoras.    When the chili chicken come out and I bit into it I remembered why I loved the chili chicken so much.  It's absolutely delicious!  I found the noodles a little oily but the meal itself was great.  I made my friend get me an order of chili chicken take out from here when he came to Ottawa the following week.  It was delicious cold and also delicious reheated!"}
{"text":"Federick's a restaurant you go to when you've told your life story to your partner and they accept you as you are. It's the kind of place where presentation is not the top priority - taste and spice are. Hands down, they have the best chili chicken, shrimp pakoras, and a red sweet sauce Hakka noodle that goes by the suave name \"Foong Mee Mein\" (literally translated as \"Red Sauce Noodles\").  Once you've discovered that person who \"gets you\", go get Federick's, together, and live happily ever after."}
{"text":"My gf and I go here often as the food here was once the best Chinese haka in Scarborough or even Toronto!  We went here a few times in the past few months and we have noticed a significant change. The food portions are much smaller. We ordered our usual of Chilli chicken and chicken pakora with shrimp. They both come with steam rice so we were surprised to be told by the waitress that \"their medium bowl\" (which looked fairly small and of course didn't go around two small females) was 2 orders of the steam rice. We got the Chilli chicken and it looked as if it were a lunch order with no sauce! This was at 6pm btw. The shrimp pakora tasted like the shrimp was a week old. Spoiled and tasted like it came from the garbage can. We ate 1 shrimp and left the rest.   I'm giving it 3 stars only because Federics has been good to us in the past."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner with hubs around 930 on a Friday to fulfill a chilli chicken craving. This place has been around forever...coworkers and friends have all mentioned it but we have never actually dined in before.  We originally planned to go to hakka legend nearby but they had a lineup..tables full, staff didn't even acknowledge us and looked stressed out so we checked out yelp and off to federicks we go The service was good..we were acknowledged and seated right away...food came fast...ordered chilli chicken (prob made in batches as it came out in minutes) but it was good with just the right amount of spice..and large portions...and a fried crispy noodle which I enjoyed...the egg noodles were crispy throughout..yum! Portions large....we had almost 3/4 of chilli chicken and rice for takeout. And prices are cheaper than hakka legend with good customer service...we will be back:)"}
{"text":"I'm here a lot because it's only a 2 minute drive away from my house!  I can't really give a good review for a dine in experience, because I always call in to pick up at Fredericks.   I call in with an order, they give you a time to pick up, and it's never failed! If they say 10 minutes, it actually is 10 minutes! The take out entrance has it's own separate door (thank god) making the process quick and painless.  The food is fantastic here, the fried rices are to die for. And the pakoras are super spicy (i cant take spicyness at all) but super delicious, packed with tons of flavour!  If you're looking for a fail proof hakka place, I highly suggest Fredericks.  I once ordered sweet and sour chicken to go, yeah, don't get it. It's terrible. Other than that, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The service is not the best. The decor looks outdated. The seating area is crammed and unbearable on hot summer days. Yet, you'll have a hard time getting a seat during the lunch or dinner rush simply because the food is mouth watering and the value for your money is unbeatable."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by Federick on a bit of a whim, since we had been shopping nearby. She'd ordered takeout before, and I'd never tried it, and we were both glad we made the decision to give it a go.  We both ordered off their lunch special menu and shared. We got Shanghai noodles with chicken, and sweet and sour chicken balls. Both were really tasty! And with both dishes I was impressed with the amount of chicken we got. The Shanghai noodles dish was loaded with it, and the chicken balls were actually full of chicken instead of a little bit of chicken surrounded by a ton of batter like some places seem to do.  The price was also amazing. $6.85 per dish, and that included a drink. The only reason this is a 4 star review instead of a 5 star, is the service. I'll clarify though: the staff themselves were actually great. We were seated right away, brought menus immediately, and had our orders in and got our food in a timely manner. Well, sort of. I was brought Shanghai noodles with shrimp instead of chicken first, and asked if this was okay, as it was close. I like both, so I said it was absolutely fine, but before I could get a fork into it, they took it away, and two of the waiters had a little argument in Chinese about it. Not right in front of me, but very close by. No big deal though, and the correct dish was on the table in front of me a few seconds later.  We also got a takeout order afterwards, and that was a little slow, but in my opinion worth the wait.  I'll definitely be going back here again anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Best chili chicken in the city. We'd normally have the chili chicken, kanshu green beans, chicken pacora, Manchurian fried rice. Over the years always been a favourite of ours. Can't complain about the food. Reason it's not a 5* is because of the waiting staff. Service could be better."}
{"text":"FatCat's taste buds get confused first time FatCat try Frederick many years ago. Is FatCat eating Chinese? Or is FatCat eating Indian? FatCat not know.... so he create new category in brain for this food.  FatCat later find out that this food have name already.. Hakka Chinese. FatCat get happy because he experience something new. FatCat learning new things about different cultures all time.   Things FatCat like - foooood. - prices. - Mr owner recently redecorated store and make more space for customer. FatCat wish he have human hands so FatCat can do thumbs up for Mr Owner. Meow...  Things FatCat not like - lady server sometimes try to rush FatCat out when store busy.  Not big problem for FatCat because FatCat take his time anyway and not feel rushed even when server lady try."}
{"text":"Why are people so crazy about this place? The service is so poor that just based on that, I wouldn't go back. They are blatantly rude to their customers and truly do not value your business. Also, they don't care about what you order. I was very clear in explaining that I have an allergy to MSG and did not want any used in my food. Sure enough, I had a reaction so they clearly didn't listen. As for the taste of the food, I've had better quality food at Hakka Legend down the street. This place is over rated."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place are the spring rolls. There is literally nothing else on this places menu that is worth buying. Spring rolls are bomb, though."}
{"text":"Worst chili chicken ever! I bought a full order of chili chicken for lunch.  Chicken was dry, tasted days old & how dare they serve me several days old chicken like we wouldn't notice!  Why do people continue to go here at give a good review?!  People, there are way better Hakka food out there : Lin Garden, Tangerine, Supper Hakka, Asian Garden,  & China Garden to name a few!  Never again will I go to Federicks and even the one in Markham!  Smarten up people!  This place sucks!  They are serving us cheap quality foods and you are all falling for it!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a tastier Hakka chinese food before! They are addictive!  Our preset menu for two: chilli chicken with extra gravy extra spicy, mixed fried rice, chicken pakora. Price for two: 25"}
{"text":"GARBAGE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Ordered a egg roll which was drenched in a puddle of oil. I advised the server and showed him and his response was \"it's fried that's why\" I explained to him I have eaten many egg rolls before and this was not normal. He yelled at me in the restaurant and told me he will take it off the bill but don't order it next time! I was appalled people were starring at that point we decided to pay for the soup and left and went to Hakka Legend which was up the road which I definitely recommend great service and food. Will never return here EVER."}
{"text":"I checked out this Scarborough hole-in-the-wall based on it's rating and good reviews here on yelp...  It did not live up to expectations.    Staff was unfriendly and dismissive.  The fact that they do not speak English, and I do speak English only does not excuse rude and dismissive treatment of customers.  Food was unimpressive.  I ordered the chili chicken and the crispy shrimp, both dishes that were reccomended by yelpers.  The chili chicken arrived lukewarm.  which makes me suspicious that it was reheated, rather than freshly made.  The shrimp were more in line with what I would expect from Mandarin, doughy batter and rubbery, overcooked shrimp.  In addition, the rice that was supposed to accompany my chili chicken did not arrive until the end of the meal -- regardless of my many pleadings attempts to flag down passing staff.  Not impressed.  Take all positive reviews with a grain of salt, and do not expect fireworks.  More like run on the mill food."}
{"text":"Federick's restaurant is a Hakka joint I've been going to since as far back as I can remember. I remember how shocked I was many years ago to see one of their Chinese chefs speaking fluent Punjabi!  These chaps are known for their solid cuisine, and most importantly their chili chicken. Below is my ideal order.   Crab Corn Soup  Chili Chicken  Chicken Pakora  Manchurian Fried Rice  Manchurian Noodles  Kingfisher Beer (India)   A very close match to Federick's is Lin Garden, I will have a review for Lin Garden up soon as many people feel it is superior to Federick's. In my opinion, it's a two way tie.   *Please note this resto does not serve authentic Hakka dishes, but the Indian Chinese style Hakka cuisine."}
{"text":"Ill be honest, i havent been here for over 5 years but back then my family and I went here all the time and it was fantastic.  The flavors were there, it was spicy and huge amounts.    Its not fancy or anything but if u just want good food then try it."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is slow.  Some waiters were not friendly also.  You are better off doing take-out as you could call ahead and give your order.  If you drop by for take-out without calling ahead, expect a long line."}
{"text":"Food is good however I feel that the staff rushes you. They constantly hover over your table to clear the table while you are still eating."}
{"text":"Best hakka place in Scarborough, they recently renovated and its a nice dine-in spot s well. the Markham spot is usually busy but the Scarborough location is nice!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 10 years. My favourites are sweet and sour chicken, the fried green beans, manchurian paneer, and the chilli paneer.  The food here is always tasty, and the portions are very fair. I haven't done dine-in there in a long time, but the renovations look great. I also enjoy the friendly service from familiar faces as well.  This place is quite popular and the parking lot can be messy, so be warned. There's usually a line as well, so if you are getting take out try to call ahead to place your order so you're not waiting too long."}
{"text":"Really good takeaway Chinese food.  Huge portions and quick service."}
{"text":"The restaurant is ok but Becky is the only person who understood our order and always brought  us what we asked for. She is gone now and if you get the food as is, then it's ok. If you make any changes, be prepared for a surprise. Food is oily but good in general. The restaurant is always very crowded and no service when you need it."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but service is garbage.  Arrived 3.09 and missed the lunch special by 9 minutes.- No exception!!  Everyone is marching around like robots. Its ok tho- I dont know why people live and die by fredericks. Not as many options and not as tasty as other places.  China Cottage over Fredericks"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here at noon on Saturday and the restaurant was pretty much empty. Food came out very quickly. Food was average. Chicken dishes were best among all the dishes. Chicken was moist and well marinated. Manchurian fried rice was colorful but tasteless (very disappointing). We asked for chili chicken and chili eggplant dishes to be extra spicy but they came out very mild. In summary, the food here was not bad but we have had better."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic hakka food but they have generous portions food quality is okay well maintained environment with nice decor and friendly staff"}
{"text":"I love their chilli chicken, however my body disagrees with that oppinion. The food is decent the prices are good, the service is quick and poliet, they check up on you without smothering you, the atmosphere is nice but far from prenencious.   All in all a decent place to to go get hacka chinese (or however you spell it). I'm not blown away by anything in particular but you know. I recomend it"}
{"text":"Most of the food quality is bad.  Garlic shrimp, not bad but quantity poor, half of tray is empty. Fried rice wad crapy. Hot and sour soup was bad. Had one fish item, it didn't feel like fish pieces, felt like something fatty stuff fry.  Most annoying part is there service ladies. So rude and full of don't care attitude. I know they get lots of customers but very soon they should see customer drops with this type of service. Not going there any more. Lots of other options available in this city."}
{"text":"I'm not going to give this any more stars as I've heard this was a really great Resturant but was disappointed.    Our waitress was nice and would follow up till we got our order served.   The food was lukewarm/cold as if they pulled it from a fridge and just warmed it. The utensils were a bit dirty and place looked old."}
{"text":"Federick is an ideal example of a poor choice that keeps repeating itself. Believe me, I am still perplexed as to why I keep dining here even though I've never really received anything outstanding. All I can really say is that it's popular in Scarborough, particularly among UTSC students (note: I'm a grad).  When I arrived last week, the restaurant was booked up for a birthday party.  Therefore, the workers gave out numbers and began a lineup for walk-ins.  Strangely enough, this numbering system was poorly managed, which infuriated the family ahead of me. Customer service has never been Federick's strong point, so I wasn't fazed by this occurence. All I can safely say is that if the restaurant has been booked up for a party, it's best to look elsewhere for grub.  Furthermore, I wouldn't recommend you to bring any company that is stringent about hygienic standards. It is commonplace to receive cutlery and dishes that haven't been fully washed.  During times like these, I wouldn't bother asking for replacements, as we've received dishes of the same unsanitary quality. Just order a canned beverage instead of drinking from your glass and try to ignore the smudges on your plate.   Now, going back to the service, the servers can either be nonchalant or borderline rude. I have had servers who have clucked their tongues at me when I've been a bit slow at grabbing my wallet from my bag; I've had ones who would never check up on our table; and I've had the types who would just hastingly push food onto the table. If good service is key for you or if you're the type to easily get irritated at rude or careless actions, then stay away from this restaurant.   The food is also not a saving grace. The portions are reasonable to excellent and the flavours are decent to great, as I find the seasonings and spice combinations to be enjoyable.  However, any quality other than taste can sometimes be lack-luster. For example, the breading on the pakoras can be too thick at times, making them slightly soft by the end of the meal, and the wanton soups can...lack a decent number of wontons!  By no means were all the dishes terrible. Some were flavourful, but I have never been ''hooked'' onto any dish I've tried here.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend Federick if you're craving quality Hakka food. If you're on a budget and aren't too picky with sanitation and service, then you may want to try the combos at the back of the menu (see my photo)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to visit on a rainy weekday evening at 7pm to hopefully beat the rush. This place is always full and luckily when we got there it was fairly empty thanks to the rain but a few tables were already spoken for with reservations.  We ordered the Chicken Pakora, Chili Green Beans and Beef Rice Noodles. Service was prompt and polite although I noticed they had trouble remembering which orders belonged to which table. That resulted in some of our dishes unfortunately going to tables that most definitely arrived after we ordered. The overall wait for our food to arrive wasn't the worst but I knocked a star off for that considering it wasn't very busy.  Chicken pakoras were crispy on the outside and well seasoned. The meat was wonderfully moist inside. It packs some heat, but it was great even for someone like me who doesn't do spicy foods often. The rice they serve you helps cool the mouth.  Green beans were amazing and my favourite. Crispy on the outside and full of flavor. Every table ordered them.  Didn't know what to expect with Beef Rice Noodles since my bf thought they would be like the Cantonese style kind. Most certainly were not. Made with vermicelli which unfortunately was not something I like. I did taste some of it and the flavouring was nice. Boyfriend really enjoyed it though.  We would definitely come back here in the future and try more menu items"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Frederick's by a friend last week. The owners and waitresses are really nice and helpful. I got the Manchurian fried rice (mixed) from the lunch menu and it was delicious.  I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place was very good about 10 years. Didnt even know what hakka chinese/indian is. I would say this is the original Hakka Food. Made to perfection. Only problem i had was the guy that used answer the phone was so horrible. Made me laugh after i order. He treated you like crap. He would yell Fredrickkkkkkkkks. Like you have to talk quick, dont waste no time cuz they only had 1 line. lol. When you pull to the pick window. They are running and scrambling. But they actually speak Hindi.(not a chinese restaurant conversion) They are the first ever hakka restaurant. The dishes are very unique. Nobody can match. Why i rated 3 stars is they could use some improvements like customer service, not leave food sitting in the back so long therefore spoils.(had an exprience with that). Try to go when its not busy so they take their sweet time to cook it to perfection. I highly recommend manchurian fried rice. Nobody in Ontario can make it like they make. HUGE portions. They are not shy about giving your moneys worth. I will try them tonight and perhaps change the rating. Have to drive to Scarberia for that.  Update. Wow the changed the whole structure, what an ambience. Food is so fresh and hot. They have rebuilt the restaurant. Everyone looked happy eating. I was so pleased."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's (and his boyfriend's :p) favorite restaurant in the entirety of the history of their childhood (seems like). Also being rated as the top restaurant in Scarborough by blogto, I can see the much raved appeal. Food is good, pricing is reasonable and tables are almost always packed at dinner. Must haves include their chilli chicken and the pakoras dipped in sweet and sour sauce (sub with plum sauce on lazy days). I'm sure I'll be coming back for years to come..."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of their menu items and overall I was pleased with the quality and quantity of their food and service.  Tasty and flavourful food; lots of seasoning and yummy spices  Very generous portions; I once shared one dish among 3 other people Their decor has improved by a lot; a lot more modern and fresh looking They have a lot of staff there so wait time isn't long and they're all very friendly  Reasonable prices for the amount they're giving you  I gave it 3 stars because at times their food is very oily and greasy. I found that usually this is not the case, but sometimes because they can be heavy-handed on that oil and the other flavours become masked by it Overall I would still come back here to try more menu items"}
{"text":"Was hoping for a new go-to spot close to our house. This will not be it.  Ordered take-out. Customer service was severely lacking both on the phone and when I picked up my order. Food was sub par. We ordered the chili chicken  but it was meh. Chow mein was alright. Shrimp pakora was frankly soggy and just mediocre.  If you want good hakka - I liked luckys better."}
{"text":"Best Hakka in the GTA. Cant say the same about their Markham location!  Food was bland, not seasoned properly."}
{"text":"Deep in the Heart of \"ScarGhetto\" (sorry I live in Detroit now, I'm highly doubtful of Scarborough's Ghettoness now) is a little store called Fredricks. It's easy to miss, as it is fairly modest from the outside. Inside it's not really a whole lot better. But the food is pretty awesome.  The food in this restaurant is what many people call Hakka Chinese. As I have said before, a number of people immigrated from the Hakka region to India; consequently people think this is Hakka. It's not, at least not anymore than Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls is authentic Chinese Food. It is food made by people often from the Hakka region, it has traveled from China to India and now it's in North America. I definitely like it. Though I don't like Kingfisher beer.  The food is probably one of the best examples of Fusion foods, the food is really worth trying,"}
{"text":"Went here when I studied at UTSC, down the road pretty much.  Great place for college kids, generally cheap Chinese/Hakka food but pretty tasty.  My wife and I come back whenever we're in the area.  Our general order has been - crab corn soup, Frederick's delcious crispy chicken balls and two bowls of white rice.  I've ordered the chili chicken (the go to dish) but don't really love it from here.   It's decent but I like the taste of their chicken balls better.  To let people know, these chicken balls aren't the kind you order from Mandarin or \"Chinese take out\" but rather pieces of chicken clumped together with dough and deep fried to a crispy finish.  Kinda like...pakoras.  Always loved crab corn soup so...I'm impartial.  When would you go to Frederick's?  Hmmmm, you've just been to a some boring \"event\" and you're starving.  You aren't really feeling clean and fresh, you're not dressed well but want something filling and savory and FAST."}
{"text":"This place is really out of the way for me nowadays, but I used to come here quite a bit about a decade ago. I've poked my head in here to eat a couple of times as an adult and it's still pretty dingy and run down. Good to see that it's still busy though. I think it's pretty well known by regulars that this place has gone down in quality in the last decade. Even still, I still think that 40 bucks here will get you much more than most places in Toronto. Standalone, it ain't the greatest- but compared to everything else, I really can't complain. Get the chili chicken, manchurian chicken fried rice, fish pakoras and banana fritters for dessert. Don't ask, just do it."}
{"text":"As a University student, I used to come here all the time. Then when I moved away - this was one of my stops to pick up food when driving through Toronto...  Went for lunch this week with a co-worker. Ordered  Veg Manchurian Noodles - They were ok.  Nohting special.  More colour than flavour Shanghai Noodles - Flavourless..  I think this is pretty much the last time that I'll be eating here. Nostalgia only lasts so long.."}
{"text":"For some reason the food here always makes me sick. It's one of those places that you love to hate. Food taste really good, but you are going to regret eating it after. I tried the shrimp and it was Amazing!"}
{"text":"It feels like I'm in an Out-of-Town Chinese restaurant from the outside and the interior design.  We're only in Scarborough but it's nice to have a feeling that I'm Out-of-Town as a getaway from work this morning.  I'm pretty new to Hakka/Indian food/restaurants so my review is based on the simplicity of what my personal preference tells me I like or dislike.  Fish Pakora($8.25) reminded me of Clam Cakes from Rhode Island except the Crab Corn Soup($7.50) wasn't the perfect accompaniment like how Clam Chowder goes perfectly with Clam Cakes.    Fish Pakora had that doughy spongy texture and small chunks of Fish meat inside.  Crab Corn Soup was below average as I've had plenty of those before and as a Chinese descendant I can make my own that isn't as overly Corn Starched.  Real Crab Meat, but probably not the fresh variety.  Chili Chicken($11.50) was a bit bland with the Soya Sauce more dominant than the Chili flavour which even as a non-spice eater, it lacked the Chili aspect however the dish did have a couple whole Chilis but I wish the sauce was where the heat should be."}
{"text":"Great Hakka, large portions, good pricing... Pakora, Chili Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, and Sweet & Sour Chicken are my favs... Great lunch menu also."}
{"text":"Best hakka food in the GTA.  The shrimp pakoras and chili chicken are the standouts.  May have to wait a while for a table for dinner on weekends, especially after 8."}
{"text":"Frederick's is the OG of hakka cuisine restaurants. It seems as if this place has been there forever! Though there have been a ton of knock offs open up in the last 5 years or so, I don't think any other place will take over as the most successful hakka restaurant in the tdot.   They have an entirely separate take out window, which is always packed with people waiting for their orders. There is often a lineup for the restaurant itself on weekends, and on long weekends, forget about it.  What's good? Oh man, what's not good? My traditional orders are chilli chicken, crispy beef, sweet and sour chicken balls, vegetable chow mein, beef fried rice, chicken fried rice, chicken pakoras, and my favourite is the chicken corn soup which I must deem essential.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food is always stellar. The only downside I would say about this restaurant would be the wait times since I despise waiting in line.   Frederick Restaurant - 5/5 stars. If you don't know what this place is about, you're really missing out."}
{"text":"reno was good. It looks like a springrolls.. kinda. more updated decor, better lighting. food is still meh....   I just want to understand chilli chicken - I've never had good chilli chicken. Especially not the one here. I was excited to order it after reading all the other yelper reviews but when I get it ... it's just weird tasting. I keep trying and the dish just keeps.. sucking. I dunno, it's probably just not my thing. I've had better hakka food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and don't understand the hype. We ordered the mixed hakka chow mein, shrimp pakora and the Frederick's delicious garlic shrimp. All of it was NOT GOOD. I'm actually going to go ahead and say it was nasty. I will never return."}
{"text":"Hits the spot! I was craving for chilli fish for a while now and I'm happy I went here. I was always hesitant because their servings sizes are always so large. We got the chilli fish dry, mixed fried rice with chicken and shrimp, and sweet and sour chicken balls. We just went for take out because the restaurant was packed (again). The chilli fish came with 2 containers or white rice too. So I guess we're set for the week! Couldn't even finish any of the dishes."}
{"text":"Updated review some of the chefs left and opened a restaurant up in Markham. Now the food quality isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"Dece!  Killed me on the MSG, doe.  Tried chili chicken, green beans, and fried calamari. We asked the table next to us and they actually recommend the general tao chicken so consider getting that over chili chicken (this was popular order coming out the kitchen). I know, I know, traditionalists will be outraged but you can reserve thanks when the flava hits your tastebudz"}
{"text":"If you are seeking that perfect place to take your first date, or someone you admire. Fredrick's is not that place. The decor is somewhat corny, and outdated but if your looking for a great place to eat and don't mind the sight for sore eyes then you're in for a treat.  Hands down best Hakka food.  Try the chilli chicken, or the sweet and sour shrimp.  They have great lunch specials really cheap all of the dishes come with a side of rice and a drink.  A good rule of thumb is not to order to many dishes ( 2 people -3 dishes more than enough, with food to take home)"}
{"text":"Dannnnnng, that was good.  Based on reviews and recommendations from friends, I came in with cautious optimism, and left with my expectations well surpassed.  The location was not far from Scarborough Town Centre, in the base of a low rise office building.  Nothing fancy from the outside, but inside was quite nice and much classier than I expected.  Very nice decor, and clean. Staff was friendly with no service issues, and the food came lightning quick (probably because they have a takeout arm of the restaurant so they're used to having the food come out quick).  On to the food.  The chili chicken was phenomenal, though as much as I like spice, I found I was picking out the chillis about half-way through because there was just too much heat.  Very nice otherwise though.  The green beans were also quite good - perhaps a smidgen undercooked, and very garlicky, but the platter was empty by the end, so that speaks more than words.  The final dish was the fish pakora, and it was melt-in-your-mouth good.  If you come here, get it.    Price was very affordable - 3 dishes and a coke for $32 incl. tax/tip - you can't beat that. I'll be back 100%.."}
{"text":"Located in small plaza, has its own dedicated take out window & further inside is a proper sit-down restaurant.   Offers a wide range of Hakka food, however, there are few items that must be consumed if you come here.  1) Chili chinken: Because you do not ever go to a Hakka restaurant and NOT order chili chicken, this place makes it pretty good, but places more emphasis on soy flavor. Can't go wrong with this chili chicken, but always can be better.  2) Ginger Fish: Battered and filleted into bite sized pieces, slathered in a sweet and sour, but also spicy gingery type sauce. This dish tastes really good and helps balance out the ultra spicy dishes, gotta eat to believe it.   3) Chicken pakoras: Plate piled high in bite-sized battered chicken flesh, spices in the batter creates decent pakoras. Most other pakoras rely heavily on small amounts of chicken surrounded with tons of flour which is a rip, when I order chicken pakora I want the breading to be chicken as well. These chicken pakoras have minimal filler and maximum meat, although not the most vibrant in flavor.  Overall is an enjoyable place to dine at, I bring people here semi often and they all like it. Service is attentive and fast!"}
{"text":"This literally is one of those hole-in-the-wall places that serves up some pretty decent food.  There are definitely some hits and misses here.  Misses: Cream Corn Seafood Soup - it's a bland soup with a heavy handed helping of corn starch slurry that leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.  Manchurian Beef - both the look and taste of this dish are appalling. It came as a plate of red sauce with chunks of beef in it and it tasted just awful.  We took a few bites and let it be all night.  Hits: Chicken Pakora - I would come back to this place just to eat this dish.  If you love pakoras this dish will knock your socks off.  It literally tastes like pakoras but with huge chunks of chicken breast that's not hidden under a thick coating of batter. Fried to perfection and tender as ever.  Yum Yum!!  Szechuan fried rice with beef and shrimp - this dish is hot as hell. You don't notice it the first two bites but then it hits you like a ton of bricks.  But no matter how hot it is, I couldn't stop eating it because it tasted really good.  Ok:  Chili Chicken - it was not too bad but I found the texture of the fried chicken pieces a bit off.  The sauce could have done with a bit of sugar to highlight the chili flavour."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS   I've been here numerous times over the years (before they renovated as well - when it was a little dive joint).    The décor is nice - an improvement over what it looked like before.  Now it looks like a restaurant you can take a date to..lol (I did not).  The food is Chinese/Indian (Hakka) fusion and the variety you will find here will please everyone.  The portions are huge so definitely sharing platters that you will have leftovers with.  Seriously you can't beat the prices for the quantity and quality.   You can also order take-out - and pick it up - they are pretty fast with that service.   the servers are attentive if not a little brisk, but what does it matter when you are stuffing your face with chili chicken and fried rice?  The parking lot is small and always packed.  A overall solid choice for food in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service . Love the flavour of the food there . My personal fav is shrimp pakoras"}
{"text":"I have been going to Federick's for years now and they always use to be my go to hakka restaurant up until a couple of years ago when I switched. I find that the food has been hit or miss for quite some time.    We ordered the following:  Chilli Chicken- Was ok, was served nice and hot but I found it to be salty Crispy Beef- This was bland and greasy. The sweet sauce on the side was lumpy and way too sweet. Chicken corn soup- This was served hot and it was tasty Green beans- Always seems to be a winner, they are delicious. Hakka chow mein- the taste is good but I found the noodles to be starchy and they were sticking to my teeth Chicken Pakoras- These were very tasty and cooked just to a nice crispy batter without holding a lot of oil.  Service- you never expect great service in a restaurant like Federick's where they are just trying to move people in and out as fast as they can since they lines are always out the door.   Price- overall the price is not bad, typical to most hakka restaurants ($7-$13 per item)  Portions- HUGE  Atmosphere- Busy, rushed, and loud but with a nice new renovated and clean décor."}
{"text":"Great food at this place.. the Pakoras (fish) rock here.. The chilli chicken is awesome here too. It gets very very busy here and could get loud but dont let that discourage you.. Its not a five star looking place at all but the food is five star .."}
{"text":"I had beef with black bean and green pepper, sweet and sour chicken, and egg fried rice. It was all tasty, especially the chicken. We were ordering to take away and even though they were very busy we waited less than 10 min. The portions are enormous. We paid 21 dollars for the two of us and we have enough leftovers for another 2 or 3 meals!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants in GTA. get the chicken pokora"}
{"text":"Great food.Service could be better. Have been coming here for 15 years. The best chicken pakoras I've ever had. Would recommend everyone to try chili chicken and any mix fried rice dish."}
{"text":"Why not, 4 stars. Great lunch specials for some spicy and Hakka style for under $7.  Caught up with a friend here over a work lunch and couldn't be happier. It's a greasy spoon for a lot of wok and fried Chinese and Hakka dishes but it's delicious. They give you over 20+ lunch special choices each at $6.20 which includes a drink.   It's a smaller joint but lots of tables and if there isn't parking in the front there is tons in the back.   I got the Hakka chowmein with beef and shrimp. Friend had chilli chicken. Portions are huge and they bring it to you family style. Both very tasty and ready pretty quickly. Good spot for a working lunch in the area and would definitely come back.   They don't accept Amex but many places dont so no big deal."}
{"text":"Worst food ever I used to like in 2007 but now food stinks and its taste bad we retuned chilli chicken twice.it was so salty and taste old.I will never go back again"}
{"text":"Best place in Scarborough for hakka food ! Authentic and delicious. Not sure about the inside experience as I always call order and pick up. Been going here since i developed memory, I've tried to check out other places around the area but nothing can compete with Fredricks there chilli chicken is just something you can't find else where and their fry rices! Their prices are more than reasonable as well. Great food & price"}
{"text":"Federick is a nice Hakka Chinese place to go to in Scarborough.  This was my second time here, tonight we ordered chicken pakora, mixed fried rice, and tofu with beef.  Chicken pakora was great as always, nice and spicy.  Tofu with beef was soft and very nice, mixed fried rice was a little too mushy and had a slightly burnt taste.    I hear Federick and Lucky are the two best places in Scarborough for Hakka Chinese food."}
{"text":"The most awful flavored and bland hakka chinese I have had in my entire life. Even the mall foodcourt chinese food is better. When we order hakka chinese food, it is finished in one sitting. The food we got we had 2/3 leftover and they were thrown out.   What we ordered  Schezwan Fried Rice - They put paprika powder in the fried rice lmao!! I am used to eating schezwan cuisine and the sauce is so wonderfully flavored. These people iust threw in powder in their fried rice.   Manchurian Chow Mein - Bland AF! Who the hell puts bok choy in a fried Chow Mein. It turned it even more bland. All it was just orange color, boiled shrimp, wilted bok choy and no flavor.   Manchurian Chicken - Filled with cornstarch and overwhelming amount of coriander stems which made it so damn bitter.   Fried Dumpling - flavorless meat  Hot n Sour soup - manageable but I have had better elsewhere.   I am never going back here. They do not know how to make hakka chinese food. Everything is a bastardization of original hakka and it doesnt even taste good. We had to throw out our food. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Went there on a recommendation for their chop suey. Called up ahead for pickup. Ordered the American chop suey and the General Tao Chicken.   The good: The chop suey was delicious. The flavours were fantastic. Chicken / shrimp were nicely cooked, soft. Fresh rice. Ironically not as much heat as I would've liked but I'm accustomed to that! The general Tao chicken though bloody hot.    The bad: The amount of chicken / shrimp in the chop suey was barley any. The egg was horrendous. Looked and tasted horrible. The vegetables (esp broccoli and carrots) were super large. An way too many onions. Almost cried in between. The general Tao chicken though was over cooked tremendously. Nice flavour but didn't look all that appetizing.   Gonna give this place the benefit of the doubt for now and try something else next time to make sure, considering the reviews."}
{"text":"Large quantities, well maintained environment and friendly staff here. I think the taste could be better. Maybe it was the food we tried."}
{"text":"I really don't see the hype when it comes to Fredrick's. Being a staple in the Scarborough side I've given it a go one 3 different occasions, all in the dining room. Each time left something to desire.  The staff have always been on point and nicely accomodating. Customer service isn't the issue, it's the food.  The fried rice is overly greasy, and the spicy fried rice is wet for some reason.  I've had better chili chicken at numerous other Hakka style restos.  It seems Fredrick's is either hit or miss with folks. With me it's a miss, ill go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Hakka place! The food is delicious! If you're there order the chili chicken, Manchurian shrimp noodles, hot and sour soup, and vegetarian pakoras, You will not be disappointed. The prices are very reasonable and the amount of food is huge, great for when you're having a bunch of friends over, These dishes already come very spicy so don't be a hero and order extra spicy! The service is actually horrible almost every time I came in. But don't be offended, trust me the food is amazing so just put up with the unqualified staff because the food I recommended is 5 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the first things I noticed when I came here for a business lunch was the amount of larger individuals eating lunch! This I usually take as a good sign!    Although not the best Hakka (Chinese Indian) I've eaten it is damm excellent value!  Most dishes are $5 - 6 and come with a soft drink!  On this visit we ordered the Chicken fried rice, Chilli Chicken, Beef with Black bean and Chicken chow mein.  All were good with flavour! If you are up for a greasy spoon Chinese that is crazy cheap you shouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"For just about $8 you can get your fill of food along with tea or pop. The service, while rushed and impersonal, was also relatively fast. Sure, the service is hit or miss but at the price, can you really complain? I would say not. Federick is a great restaurant and one I always look forward to going to.   Their standard fare is average. You have all your standard hakka options here. The food itself tastes a bit cheap but again, you really can't complain. The selling point of Federick is the incredibly low price, whether you're coming in for the lunch special or not."}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this place so my expectations were quite high. In a plaza, there's a lot of parking on site. The restaurant is quite clean and they have a number of booths available; there's also a 'take out' area. I went on a Saturday afternoon at twelve o'clock. It wasn't too busy on the 'dine in' side; however, the 'take out' side was quite busy. We ordered a number of dishes, including: beef and broccoli, lemon chicken, and fried rice. The food was so bland;there was no taste and I was thoroughly disappointed. I tried it once and I think I'm okay not returning a second time as I can get my Hakka fix at another location.  Good for: Hakka Cuisine"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times, and every time I eat at the restaurant the food is great, but not so much when I take out. I feel the food doesn't taste quite the same. I am a fan of their shrimp pakoras, chilli chicken and shanghai noodles. The shrimp pakoras tasted amazing when we at it there but not so much when we did take out. I am not a fan of their chicken balls because they are too tough and small, in fact probably one of my least favourite chicken balls I have tried. I would highly recommend this place, when you are looking for some tasty Chinese hakka style food!"}
{"text":"Super greasy hakka food. Came here for dinner; it was quite busy. Ordered fried rice, beef with broccoli, and shrimp pakoras. Beef dish was quite salty, fried rice was greasy, but pakoras were perfect. Had a good amount of jalapenos in them, so beware if you arent into super spicy food."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to try it based on the  good reviews here on yelp.  Ordered the fried rice and the hakka noodles.  Both we bland over salted dishes.  We eat them because we were really hungry.  The service was poor, the waitress seemed to want us out of there really fast, then no one came by to see if we were happy with our meal or wanted to order drinks.  Based on this experience I would stick to the Tangerine restaurant just down the street from here, better food and service for the same price."}
{"text":"This is the Original Frederick's.  It's is one of those classic Hakka Restaurants that everyone knows about, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien even dined here back in the day.   Now newly renovated, the aesthetic and vibe has changed so much in recent years, This location in particular is  the older one out of the two, but it still holds up pretty well.   I've only dined in a couple of times, and it's not amazing, I honestly much rather prefer takeout from this location.   I some of my usual go-to dishes are:   Veggie Hakka Noodles - The noodles are always thick and cooked so well. Never soggy or limp.   Chili Chicken with Gravy  - a staple! it has a lot of green chillies   Manchurian Chicken with Gravy - Tossed in a Red Manchurian Sauce, it has a great taste and its not too spicy!  Chilli Paneer: It's honestly a great alternative if you're a vegetarian.  Veggie Fried Rice - it's honestly just as good as the Chicken Fried Rice, (they just substitute the chicken with Broccoli ) so if you have vegetarian with you, definitely get this to share!  Chicken Corn Soup - A Hakka Staple! It's a pretty mild soup with exactly as its described; chicken and corn.  The portions are always generous, and the price point is pretty great."}
{"text":"Hakka with much left to be desired. Lots of thickening agent used. Had the Hakka noodles (made with egg noodles?), chili chicken and schezuan beef. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over ten years and have yet to leave disappointed. I've been to other Hakka places that are much closer to my house than Federick's and they're not as good!  Don't come here if you like using anything besides a fork to eat your food. Also, food comes out at it's ready so you end up finishing plates before others come out. Staff isn't really friendly or attentive. But who cares when the food is good, right?  Kan Shue green beans are exceptional. Chili chicken and curry chicken are really good. Mee goreng is also great.  It seems like some reviewers didn't like their food. Perhaps newcomers should read yelp reviews before going so that they make sure they order the best items?"}
{"text":"Great food. We had the Shrimp chilli, Mango Chicken and Mixed Manchurian Fried rice.  Huge portions. I brought home enough food for another meal.  All dishes under ten bucks.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"- Price is cheap considering the generous portions - Pakoras are a must order as appetizer. Other recommended items - Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Beef. - Does lack healthy options. Best to come here on a cheat day. - If you're not used to spicy, make sure you let your server know. - Pro tip - weekends are extremely busy"}
{"text":"For some reason my after placing my order the food came after a minute... Weird but it was good and cheap. Though my stomach hurt the day after maybe cuz of all the spices"}
{"text":"Man oh man. This restaurant has got to be one of those places where you wouldn't expect to find great hot and sour soup, but it does. Strangely, this place serves \"Indian Chinese\" food. They have Sichuan style Chinese food but also, serves things like pakoras and Indian influenced food.  The original owners are ethnically Chinese but worked in India at the Oberoi Hotel. When they moved to Canada, they opened a restaurant and with them brought the influences of their time in India with them. The new owners have retained the restaurant's original flavors, and why not? It has definitely worked -- why change a good thing?  You will find many Indian clientele in here as well as Chinese. Honestly, this place has the best hot and sour soup I've ever had -- even in Asia -- as they make it with just the right amount of kick to it!  Our friends who are regulars ordered so I'm not sure what the names of the dishes are, but they were all very good!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever received in entire Canada... I am a big time foodie and love to try different places. This place was so disappointing.   I went there with a friend and we were starving so badly. We visited it for the first time by checking reviews like 5 stars so it's obvious that we expected more but it was not good at all. We reached there 45 mins before it closes and they already started cleaning the place. The waitress was not even welcoming us and we felt so bad but had no option so wanted to atleast try the food. We ordered couple of items which were Luke warm as if they prepared it a while ago. The waitress wanted us to leave before we started our food. Even though we mentioned we want it spicy they made it sweet which was unacceptable. The behaviour was so bad and they were mopping the floor which smelled so bad that we couldn't even finish our dinner.   I never gave bad review for any place but yes this is the place which I would never ever recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves fredericks. Once in a while he picks up food to go, so I can't speak on the dining experience but I can say the food is good. Fredericks was my first taste of Hakka cuisine and definitely won't be my last. We always order the chilli chicken, chicken/fish pakora and the chilli green beans (not sure what they are called). It taste like Chinese food kicked up a notch with more spices and flavours. The green beans were the biggest surprise. I'm not a huge fan of green beans but they were so good. A nice blend of sweet and spicy. I actually googled the recipe and made them because they are that good!"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been coming to this restaurant for years. their chilli chicken and chicken pakora are the best! But few days ago we came here as usual and we were served by an lady called \"Ann\"(we knew the name from the receipt), she's around 50 yr old,skinny, with straight black hair and was wearing glasses. this bitch had a worst attitude ever! she threw the dish to the table and talked like angry hen. we didnt want her to ruin our dinner in Federick,  so we just sucked it up and ended up saying nothing. When we finished our dinner and walked to the parking lot on the back, i saw the most disgusting thing ever! she was flirting with the an old chef there! the chef is around 60 yr old, and has been working in federick for long time and we all respected him! and we know he has a wife! !  they were touching each other (too gross to explain the detail! ). I m not a kind that care too much about ppl's personal life, but they were at work!go fuck at home please! i have little brother with me! ! this is tooo disgusting. I will never go federick again unless they get rid of such a bitch! !"}
{"text":"Just came back from a family dinner at Federick - first time going and I was surprised at the popularity of this place!  The restaurant does not open until 4:00pm on Sunday - we arrived about 1/2 hour early and watched several people try to open the door to the restaurant.  Once it approached 4:00pm there was a line up down the sidewalk.  My family was the first in the restaurant and were very quickly seated.  Almost immediately a pitcher of water was brought to the table.  Our party (5 people) had one vegetarian in it so we tried to order menu items that would appeal to both.  In the end we got vegetable fried rice, vegetable pakoras, kung pao beef, green beans and broccoli and black mushrooms.  All portions were huge and delicious - the vegetable pakoras were enjoyed by everyone!  When our bill arrived, I couldn't believe it was under $50.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Okay!! Here goes!!!  Other than today, the last time I went to Frederick was probably 2011...today I decided to give it a try..  My meal was manchurian chicken fried rice..  Portion: A very generous portion of rice and well flavored. However I didn't get much chicken.  Quality: Love the flavor. No issues there.  Price: For 10.00 I cannot go wrong. That meal can be split into 2 meals.  The good: Good place to dine Clean Quality is good Service is okay Price is decent.   The bad: Very little chicken in certain meals, however the chicken is very good.   Thanks kimoneatz@gmail.com"}
{"text":"Their lunch menu is extremely cheap. $5-$6 for what normally would cost about $10 and items include mandarin fried rice, chili chicken - basically all the staples of hakka/indian chinese food. I've been told that Federick is the best place to go for this type of food, but honestly, it's not been that impressive. Ling Garden is my go to place and i've also had better elsewhere. It's not bad, but it didn't wow me."}
{"text":"This should be a Toronto Institution.   Hakka food in China is different from this spot.  I believe their food is Hakka Chinese food in India or with Indian influences. Everyone I've taken to this restaurant absolutely loves it. The prices are very affordable as well.   Dishes I recommend:  Chilli Chicken - very spicy chicken dish with spices and gravy.  Chicken Pekora - Batter fried chicken balls with spices  Chicken fried rice.  Stir Fried Green beans.  I've never enjoyed the beef dishes or any non chicken dishes at this restaurant.  Decor:  The newly renovated decor is \"cozy\" but modern, clean and  with ambient light.   Service: Quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Federick's after hearing nothing but great things.  I was quite disappointed in the bland, tasteless food. We ordered the chili chicken, crispy beef, and szechuan eggplant.  The beef was literally just battered and fried, no sauce or any type of flavor. The chili chicken had no flavor at all. It was no different from any other bland chicken dish you get at sub-par chinese restaurants. The eggplant was the only thing worth eating, and even that's a stretch.   Also, as many say, wait staff could use some work. But I'm not very picky about that as long as the food is up to par."}
{"text":"Federick, you really disappointed me!!   When your kitchen's cooking is worse than mine, I really have an issue!!  The Corn with Crab soup is so starchy that basically my spoon can just stuck there upright! The Crab though not fake crab are the previously frozen/canned varieties and is so fishy! I definitely can make my soup from the canned corn from the supermarket and makes it so much better! The whole table even have a hard time even finishing their small bowl.  The Chilli Chicken has no chilli, no spicy, no fire... It is not even wok hot! The reason I am eating out in an restaurant because I want the dish to be fresh and serve hot directly from the wok.... It taste like something I get from T&T hot food department...  The Fish Pakora hardly have any favour... but at least it is the best out of the 3...  The indifference waiterstaffs with no smile I can get over since this is normal for Chinese restaurant.. but medicore food.. I really cannot stand!  I hope my experience is just an off night from the kitchen.. it is so sad when this happen... Will I be back?  Sorry, maybe not!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Awesome place for a short lunch break. Wen't with couple co-workers at our lunch break. Have awesome lunch specials which are very well portioned. Had enough to take home for a bite after work before i started dinner. highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The renovations they did to this restaurant are nice. I usually get take out and bring the food home though. The chicken pakoras are delicious. This is the only place I will buy them. However sometimes they take it overboard with the pepper! So if really spicy is not your thing just let them know to make the food less spicy."}
{"text":"The first and original Hakka place in Scarborough.  The good: The prices are cheap. The servings are plentiful.  The decor was recently renovated and is nice. The fact it's the first Hakka place is good...I guess.  The bad: The food sucks. There are better options around now.  The ugly: The parking sucks asphalt."}
{"text":"I went here the other night not knowing what to expect, having heard of them primarily from their ad on tv.  I was pleasantly surprised.  we ordered a medium hot and sour soup, which was enough for two, AND leftovers for the next day, and it had tons of tofu, and was really hot, and tasted awesome.  Then the fish pakoras, which was equally huge, and delicious, AND hot.  I had the lo mein (that's what I call it) with shrimp, and my husband had the orange chicken.  Our only complaint was that the chicken was not very orangey, but it wasn't bad.  For under $40, tip included, we had a feast, with lunch the next day.  The restaurant itself is pretty utilitarian, and non-descript. but I would go again any day for the food.  The take out was doing a brisk business as an aside."}
{"text":"Just okay. I feel like the Federicks by Markham and 14th is way better! The service was.. something different in a bad way. Although some of the servers were nice, there were about 5 different servers walking back and forth. Within 10 minutes, we got asked \"did you order yet?\" about 15 times (yes I'm serious). They seemed SO confused! We decided to order the soup first and while having our soup we got interrupted so many times. They should have a server assigned to each section. Also, one waitress was extremely rude, she was showing us so much attitude!!  One huge plus about this restaurant would be that it is really clean.  Other than that, the food was really good. My favourites would be the Manchurian shrimp fried rice, chilli chicken with gravy and shrimp with mixed vegetables.  Probably wouldn't come back to this location because of the service, I rather go to Markham and 14th."}
{"text":"My favourite night of the week Federicks Fridays!  One of my favourite restaurants. Although customer service is not their strong suit, their chili chicken is the best I've ever treated!"}
{"text":"Busy place , service was ok , kinda lack luster . It seems like they specialize more in take out as there was a huge line up at take out area and quality care  And detail of food was lacking. The chicken pakoras were hot and served quickly, but literally soaking in oil . They could have given it an extra minute to drip or when pulling them out of fryer easily placing on some paper towel would help minimize the greasiness . The chili chicken was spot on with the spice but once again greasy and just slopped on plate. I'd go back if there wasn't any other Hakka options but there's are a couple to continue trying out  and my patronage will be loyal where they care more about the customer and the food they serve."}
{"text":"was going to check out Hakka Legend down the street, but the place was jammed and line up out the door.   while i was waiting for a spot.. i noticed the number of unsatisfied customers inside.. virtually noone had food on their table and everyone was getting upset.  I realized they were taking care of the huge line up of take out orders instead.    I opted for Federick instead... and it was not a mistake.  Small restaurant but the portions of the food were large.. very large.. and price was very reasonable.  The food came out very quick.. the chilli chicken came out almost instant which have been wondering if it was pre-made...   i tried their federick chop suey chow mein and chilli chicken.  Both were okay.  Great value... huge bowl of rice.. and service was very attentive.    Price was actually on average about 50cents to 1 dollar cheaper per dish than Hakka Legend down the street.  I will definitely come back to try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment.  We came to Federicks on the advice of a good friend.   What we experienced fell severely short of her recommendation.  Service was fair.  The chicken pakora and chili chicken were both way too greasy.   The worst part is the nausea and severe intestinal distress that I have been experiencing since last night originated there.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"You want great haka food? Then this is the place for you. I've been a regular at this place for over a decade. Sure the dining room decor is less than spectacular, but the food speaks for itself. Order the chili chicken and prepare your taste buds for a flavour explosion."}
