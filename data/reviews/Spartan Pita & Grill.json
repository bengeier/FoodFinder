{"text":"This place is just full of noms. From the Shawrma to the homemade tabbouleh Oo and the potato wedges drizzled with hand made tzatziki sauce that the owner himself makes. 
The place is owned by a husband and wife who not only are super nice (giving you samples while you wait for your meal) but they get to know you. 
Great food, great service, honestly the only place I go for Shawrma now."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma is indeed very nice however didn't like the falafel ..the place is clean and tidy though !"}
{"text":"Just finished eating my takeout order of the chicken souvlaki and it was phenomenal!! So fresh, and flavourful, made on the spot. The salad was amazing! 
I was sad to see it wasn't as busy as this place deserves to be. The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly. 
I'm a huge foodie and was happy to see all the food was fresh. I will be promoting this place to everyone, and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I go here often as I live right beside this place!!! Amazing food amazing people, I usually get chicken souvlaki plate with extra hot sauce!"}
{"text":"The best falafel wrap I have ever had. I also tried the lentil soup which tasted like home made fresh soup. Excellent customer service by the owner himself. Iam glad I tried this place. I will be trying the rest of the items on the menu shortly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Another place with a Greek name but likely run by Middle-Easterners - not a bad thing, and you also get shawarma and other stuff with that.

I ordered the beef shawarma pita, and the beef came out marinating in a container, and then cooked on a flat top. I only noticed the chicken shawarma and donair on a spit. That said, the beef was delicious, great quality, and obviously nice to have freshly cooked.

Others have mentioned the freshness of everything, and they live up to that reputation. All the veggies were crisp, and I loved the flavours of the sauces - including the tzatziki which had that authentic tang to it. The hot sauce was interesting as it was very thin - almost watery, but had great flavour. 

I saw a few other orders being prepared too, and they all looked great, including the chicken skewers which looked nicely marinated and then cooked fresh.

My only issue is the pita was already messy before I even opened it and naturally became even more so as i began to eat. Let's just say it was a good thing I was wearing my zipped-up coat. Perhaps I could've asked for less sauce, but I also feel that pita is sometimes not the best to keep things intact, and other flatbreads such as lavash or laffa are better to keep things intact. I'd recommend dinning in if you order the pita - or ordering a platter instead.

Great place, and probably my favourite of it's type in Brampton that I've come across. Again, really: fresh, flavourful and great quality."}
{"text":"I'm one of the regulars to this place whenever I want Mediterranean food and the place does have a good wide selection to choose from.

Though I am a little biased toward chicken shawarma which is exceptional , other dishes like souvlaki and gyros are a must try too. Home made sauces is a plus which makes it different chains.

One particular thing about this place is that the owner is very passionate about what he does and takes great attention to what type of flavour you want. 

Cost for 2: $25

{"text":"I found my chicken shawarma wrap better than any place in the city. The toppings selection is extensive and fresh. Everything tasted very fresh and well prepared. The pita was grilled to just the right crispness, and I liked that it was thicker than most wraps. Like other reviewers, quality is very obvious in the meals prepared here. I can't shake my craving to enjoy another healthier and tastier lunch here!"}
{"text":"Decent but they didn't make fresh pita bread. Chicken shwarma tasted pretty good but the falafel was lacking."}
{"text":"My regular middle eastern place, Shwarma Queen was closed on Sunday but this place was open, so I decided to try it. Portions not as big as Shwarma Queen but still enough to make you full. I would rank it the same as Pita Nutso in terms of what you get for a shwarma plate. They had many other items as well but I think I'd stick with my regular place just for portion sizes."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up in our area, and my gosh the food was absolutely delicious.  I had the Chicken Shwrama Plate.  All the ingredients were so fresh , the chicken was nicely grilled, the pita was delicious.  I have to say it was the most tastiest Chicken Shwarma dish I've had in Canada ever.  I also had the fresh lemonade that they have their own receipe for, and it was absolutely refreshing and yummy.

The prices are typical Greek food prices but the quality is exceptional and this will now be my go-to place from now on.

On top of that, the owners were super friendly =)   It's nice to have a talented family-run business here instead of another typical Mr. Greek / Friendly Greek fast food joint."}
{"text":"I was jonesin for a genuine Halifax Donair & as far as I know of there are NO Official Halifax Donair shops in Brampton, which sucks!!!

I Googled \"Donair-Brampton\" & this place popped up. So I thought what the heck...let's give it a whirl!! My mistake!! I hate to trash Mom-Pop places but they said they were \"Genuine\"...they weren't. I ordered the large Donair with extra meet ($4.00 extra). It was served in a pocket pita (REAL Donair's are in a Greek pita). The sweet sauce was tasteless & my extra meat consisted of one little strip that I had to remind the server was paid for before they added it! I also ordered fries \"extra well done\"...I could tell right off after my first fry that the oil was old & stale as the Fry tasted \"off\". 

I guess my quest for a genuine Donair outside of Milton continues but it sure isn't this place!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of shawarma places around this side of Brampton but this one is sure a gem. I ordered chicken shawarma plate and I would say it wasn't only loaded with chicken but also tasted pretty damn good too. I would definitely visit the place again."}
{"text":"If you want a quick heart attack, sure go there as they use more sodium than the actual food, plus it is not fresh, meat portions are very small and the staff is extremely rude. I would never go there. 
You don't get what you pay for. Probably one of the worst shawarma places that I have been to."}
{"text":"What a great find! We stumbled upon this place while driving through Brampton and I'll tell you it's a total win! Couldn't be happier with my meal. I got the chicken shawarma plate which comes with rice, salad and choice of potato or pita. My husband had the beef shawarma plate which comes with the same options and both were absolutely delicious. You will wait a few minutes as they prepare the plate but it come to you super fresh and authentic!! Get the garlic sauce ...it's to die for. The place is exceptional clean and welcoming. The only thing the need to do better is advertise from the outside. We easily could have driven right by and never discovered this treasure. Try it you won't regret it. We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great place for Shawarma in Brampton! I've been there more than a few times and have continued to have a wonderful experience every time. Fresh ingredients & great customer service!"}
{"text":"Very nice owners. Let me and the girlfriend sample sauces and the potatoes. 

Everything was fresh to order! Very very good. Has that home made feel to it. Will be returning!"}
