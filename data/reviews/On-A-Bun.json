{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I have tried every sandwich except the veggie or eggplant and i have never been disappointed.  I am a big fan of veal sandwiches and before On a Bun I could never find a place that wasn't hit or miss every time i ordered one. However, I order here often because i go to school in the same plaza and their veal is always on point!

The first time i dropped by when i started school by there, I had asked the gentleman working cash if he could run my debit card for what i would owe before he sent the order through because i wasnt sure if i had any money in that card. He must have noticed my school ID hanging around my neck because he told me not to worry and that I could pay him the next day if it didnt go through. I thought that was so cool of him even if i did have full-time school next door.

Their customer service is great, no matter who is working.

Luckily for me i live close to the school so i can still frequent this place after i graduate!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews for this place and thought I'd give it a try. My love affair with the hot veal sangwich started in the 70's with San Francesco's and then California Sandwichs as well. I'm a regular at both. 
When I found out that On A Bun is only a couple blocks from my place I was more than eager to give it a try and I ordered the hot veal. 
Verdict... less meat than the Cali veal but very tasty none the less. The good news is you don't have to wait 20 minutes in line like you do at Cali on Chesswood or on Queensway. 
As for San Fran well I've been eating their sandwiches since they were 75 cents each on Clinton and they're still as good as ever at the Mississauga location. 
I definitely wasn't disappointed with On A Bun, the sandwich was very tasty, good quality veal and it did satisfy my craving and based on the fact that it's near me I will definitely go back. The staff is very friendly also so give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am Italian. I brought mamma home an eggplant sandwich and she was floored. Super authentic tasting sauce and the sandwiches are quality. Brought hubby home a veal - he couldnt even finish a whole one (regular size)! Me, I sneak over here once a week since I work close by and enjoy every single bite, every single time. I really appreciate that they don't just slop the sandwiches together so I can eat the without getting it all over myself when I am eating on the go. I recomend this place to everyone! Great service (with a smile) and even better food."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are pretty good. The only gripe (it is a big issue for me) I have with them is that their veal sandwiches have VERY thin pieces of meat. Sometimes when I get it, it is literally two thick crispy breaded layers and a tiny little thin piece of meat in between it, I would say that the meat is about the thickness of a pepperoni.
Honestly I like it because its close and the sandwiches are big, the flavors are decent, and there are not many other shops like this in the area.

This place is still a far cry from California sandwiches though. California taste a lot better, actually has a decent amount of meat and is much more bang for your buck. Honestly if a California sandwich opened up beside On-A-Bun I do not think they would survive very long, but until then I will still go their for my hot sandwiches.

Maybe higher quality meat, or more meat options would make me change my mind, but I'm not sure that is going to happen"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, very much like California Sandwiches but better ingredients (they had rapini, mushrooms, onions, sweet pepper and cheese as toppings) and a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. Would definitely recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'll probably edit this later on once I'm able to try out more of their selections, but for first impressions, this was a pretty nice place for a delicious lunch.

Ordered the regular-sized chicken parm sandwich, with mushrooms.  The sandwich started at 6.50, plus about 88 cents for mushrooms.  In hindsight, I should have ordered the free onions.  Spice level was 'hot'.

The place has a cute logo, nice clean interior, if not particularly spacious.  The man behind the cash was extremely friendly and very helpful in answering my questions regarding menu options.  

It should be noted that all italian sandwich shoppes will be compared to California Sandwiches(CS) - I can't help it, it's just gonna happen, this is going to happen, so live with it.

On the other hand, On-A-Bun measures up quite well, actually.  I have to admit that the fried chicken fillets were thinner and smaller than the same sandwich I get at CS, but the sauce was flavourful.  They've achieved a very good balance between the tomato/parm sauce with the spiciness of the peppers - the jalapenos' are blended instead of diced chunks.  In terms of construction, it was very well done - the sandwich was well put together and not very sloppy, although a mess on your fingers is still to be had (why else would you eat these?!).  

TLDR: So how does it stack up? There was thinner chicken, but good sauce and good balance between sloppy and firmness.  The price was also slightly lower, so that's a bonus.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich! Had the veal with sweet peppers. At $1.55 for an Americano, I'd be a regular if I lived in Mississauga. Great service too."}
{"text":"I was going to the bakery across the way and I realized my hubby and I hadn't had lunch yet so I headed over and ordered some sandwiches to go.  We were greeted very warmly and we were helped through the menu.  As we were figuring things out, Nonna waved hello to us from the kitchen...LOVE!    We were the first ones in there just after they opened for lunch, and within 10 minutes, they were pretty swamped!  

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with rapini on top (feeling a bit healthy that day since cake was coming later) and for my hubby a hot veal sandwich with onions and peppers.  

Both sandwiches were absolutely delicious.  Yes, the veal was better than the grilled chicken, but I wonder how the fried chicken would taste instead of the grilled chicken.  I also really loved the rapini on top of the chicken, a topping I've never had before in a sandwich.  

I'm happy to have found this place, and look forward to heading there again for a quick meal again soon."}
{"text":"Just recently tried this place as I was stuck in traffic and hungry. Ordered the steak and onions sandwich. The steak was very tender was very tasty, wasn't too saucy and packed with flavor. Would return and try another sandwich. Only negative the price was a little high, over $11 when I added cheese and mushrooms. But a very good sandwich."}
{"text":"Grew up eatting California's most of my life old school on Calamont Toronto .
This place is  it even close .
Went there twice had a hot steak with onions the owner was trying  sell me up graded on my sandwich tell me it would taste better with topping I told him I'll just have it the way I been having it for the last 40 years .
Steak not that good not a lot of meat hot peppers not hot .
Had a veal a week later and it was tuff could not bit through the meat instead pulling meat out of  bun 
Did not get value for my money .
If your drive south on Mavis it can be hard to get into that lot 
Will not return there ."}
{"text":"Wow, fresh and tasty chicken parm on a bun. Excellent service. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and have had both the veal and the sausage on a bun. The staff was friendly and the place is clean, but the food is only okay.  It's not worth coming back for, when San Francesco's is only a few kilometers away."}
{"text":"Ordered a veal sandwich sweet-medium and omg it was delicious. The bread is so fresh and I could see them making the fresh veal for me also. Only thing I would have liked to see is a little more sauce other than that it was perfect ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"MMMMmmmmm VEAL. If you're vegan or vegetarian please stop reading right meow because I'm gonna get violent with this review.....

.... Still reading? OK, I warned you. 

I LOVE VEAL. LOVE IT. Like, sometimes someone will bring up the whole - ohhh how could you eat a BABY cow (same for lamb). Easy, like this NOM NOM fuckin' NOM.

This is one instance where saying the younger the better doesn't land you in jail, so tie that bad boy baby bull up, slice it and dice it, filet it, fry it and smack 4-5 slices in between a fresh kaiser bun and load up the toppings and we'll call it a day. 

Do I feel bad? Only if I try to eat two sandwiches, then I regret... NOTHING!

On-A-Bun... not to be confused with the Mississauga burger joint On-THE-Bun (which is Halal), is as others have said, an Italian sanGwich shop (in Italian your pronounce all D's like G's) in the style of the reigning GTA Champions of this food style California Sandwiches and San Francesco Sandwiches. You can opt for a meatball, steak, eggplant parm, chicken or of course the veal. But let's be serious, you come for the veal.

Yes toppings MAY be at a charge, but don't be so bloody cheap, if you compare prices, the sandwiches at On-A-Bun actually run cheaper overall, and even maxing out my toppings (Rapini, Cheese, Mushrooms and Hot peppers) it's still cheaper that Cali-sands. 

Anyone who is complaining about paying for toppings - again, you're cheap. Go to the other popular joints and you will see that you pay per item. In fact, California Sandwiches is upt ot $1-$1.50 per topping, where at On-A-Bun the price lays closer to around $0.88. If you want free toppings, go to Harveys and have it your way, but don't complain about paying for high-quality gourmet ingredients.

I'm happy this place is now on my radar because when I'm in the West-end, I can now nab a calorie (1400-1800) laden sangwich for less than I usually pay at my regular spot.

Eatcrest Out.... Moo (baby cow noise) Muuahhha hahahaha"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I got the steak and onions, which I found to be quite flavorful. Obviously it's not going to be a gourmet-quality sandwich, but that's not what you're paying for. 

Service was fast and friendly. For the price, I can't see anything better."}
{"text":"Wow! I am surprised to see my fellow Yelpers are floored by this place.

I have been there about 5-6 times it is a pretty decent sandwich shop, but by no means its has the best meatball or steak sandwiches, 

So this what to expect, I believe they have two sizes for their sandwiches, they charge extra for most toppings, they do have awesome toppings like Rapini, out of the norm kind of, but that being said they put too much filler ( bread crumbs ) in their meat ball.

folks who said they love their meatballs, yes they are huge, yes they taste okay with the sauce and bread, Please try to take a bite off it by itself, you would realize it's mostly bread in it 

In the beginning of my discovery of this place, I was thrilled with the concept of an old fashion Italian mom and pop kind of sandwich joint, But sadly that is not who they are .

its just a little better than average Sandwich place, good Espresso i should add.

PS. They have okay customer service, but when I asked to toast my buns :) they refused  by saying they don't have the \"Equipment\" to do so..Really? I could see they have a hot plate ( flat top ) and stoves, and they could not figure out that you put two pieces of bun on a flat top, and it would magically toast the bun wow! of course they knew how to heat up bread but did not want to, that is not cool with me at all, Sorry I am not going back there anymore

Thanks for reading ( and it was gentleman who owns the joint I Believe )"}
{"text":"By far the best veal sandwich I've ever had. With cheese it tastes similar to chicken Parmesan. The junior size is enough for most people. I got the regular and couldn't finish it and I'm a big eater. 

Only issue I had was the fact that each topping was extra money. All you get for toppings for the sandwich is the marinara sauce."}
{"text":"This is by far the best veal sandwich place ever. Will blow any California's or San Francesco sandwich out of the water. 

Very fresh, very tasty with the right amount of sauce. 

Rocco is the best, always friendly, always in a good mood. Type of owner who remembers you. 

Look for other locations popping up around Ontario soon.!"}
{"text":"Headliner: California Sandwich type place

This place is located on Mavis and Burhamthorpe, right next to Metalworks and behind Esso/Mr. Lube (I really have to stop going to places behind gas stations) and it will cost $8 to $10 for a sandwich. 


Pros:
-Veal sandwich is excellent.  
-Sandwich is fully customizable
-choose spicy or non-spicy
-everything made fresh
-there's a bench outside for you to sit (though I'm not sure if it belongs to them or Metalworks)

Cons:
-pay for each topping (some may see this as a pro)
-not really eat-in

Verdict: If you like California sandwiches, you'll like this place. If you don't like California Sandwiches, then you should pass."}
{"text":"Wow i cant believe this place even received a high score i guess people dont know good food... i tried this place twice to give it a second chance but unfortunately the food was disgusting both times! I had a veal sandwich which was terrible! Theres no meat in this sandwich its sliced sooo thin (check it out for urself when you get one) this place should be embarrassed to call themselfs italian! Not italian quality at all! Oh and btw all these posts are by asians.... so that says it all!"}
{"text":"I found it just ok. there wasn't much of happening in the place, no promotions or even customers at 1 pm. I thought the beef sandwich was just ok . fried crumbed piece of beef in a bun with tomato sauce."}
{"text":"First time I had time to stop by here to grab one of their Italian sandwiches at lunch. The place wasn't very busy when I sat down with my sister for a quick lunch, but a lot of people started coming by for take out. 

We ordered their Veal sandwich regular size for $6.50. Half of one was good enough to fill us.  I can see how some people might not like paying for toppings individually but they aren't badly priced and are fresh toppings.  It is also cheaper than California sandwiches,  although a little smaller. I tend to find California's meat a little too tough. 

We got our Veal sandwich with some free onions and their hot sauce.  Not spicy for our tolerance but it had good flavor. The bread held the sauce well,  although I wish it had a bit more sauce to hold. The Veal was not chewy, the onions were nicely and not over cooked.

Their service was great, friendly and genuine. They were cleaning out the fryer and it would be a slightly longer wait and asked if we needed anything else. (2 to 3 mins top and it was nice to know they change the oil) I'll be back to try their other 6 sandwiches.  They also have soup,  cheap salads and coffee. It was a lot busier when we left. 

Quick, delicious and fresh lunch!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when I walked into this little sandwich shop on Mavis south of Burnhamthorpe - their menu was very similar to that of California Sandwiches. They offer a variety Italian sandwiches, including the chicken, steak and onions, veal, meatball, sausage and onions, veggie, and eggplant parmesan (my favourite).

The size of the sandwich is great considering the ~$6 price - you're guaranteed to be full. In fact, even their Junior-sized options at $5 or less are sufficient as a standalone meal. 

The staff here will definitely provide among the best customer service you've ever received. The restaurant space is always nicely kept and clean, and there's even a TV to watch while you wait. 

This is the top restaurant of its kind in Mississauga, and I definitely recommend it to those looking for a meal near the City Centre."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after being a California's fan many years. Veal sandwich was good, and fills the void but just didnt have the same crunch around the edges or sweetness of the sauce."}
{"text":"As one of the other Yelpers pointed out, it's a similar menu to California Sandwiches...except that the food is much better here. Being a vegetarian I'm a bit limited in my options but I never get sick of their simply outstanding eggplant parm. It's cooked and breaded just perfectly every time. I often find that eggplant is either often too crispy and crunchy or too soggy and rubbery. These guys nail it dead on.

The spice level is just perfect as well...I like mine hot but you have the option of getting it medium or sweet as well. Oh and did I mention that the sandwiches are HUGE and cheap? Five bucks (I add  sweet peppers for $.88 extra) for a delicious, large sandwich with cheese included is a bloody steal. 

Seriously try them out. The staff is friendly and family members assure me that their meat options are just as good. Highest possible recommendation."}
{"text":"Stopped by with friends based on the near perfect rating, but I'm not sure it justifies more than a 3.5 stars overall. It feels quite average overall, with the exception being the meatball, which was well flavored and balanced. 

Sandwiches we had were the veal, chicken, meatball and steak and onion. The bill was $47 for these. I think they really ought to include complementary toppings - choosing each item to add to your sandwich for an up charge is a bit much. The sandwiches do need the bolstering up from the toppings as they are not enough on their own. The meatball was good enough just adding cheese as the marinara on it works really well, but everything else on the menu was dry and lonesome and would need more.

You're just left wanting more somehow. I wouldn't return based on this experience."}
{"text":"Had the junior version of the fried chicken. Pretty darn good! Even for a \"junior\" sized sandwich, I thought it was sizeable. You'll probably want to get the regular size though if you have a big appetite. The sandwich doesn't come with toppings, so you have to add your own for extra money. Good if you don't like having too many toppings in your sandwich. Bad for me since I like to load my sandwiches with everything. Definitely good come again though to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Love this place! Place is clean, portions are huge and service is friendly.  I usually can tell how good a veal sandwich place by how many industrial workers are eating there at lunch, and this place always has some. You gotta try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches here. I could be wrong but I believe it's a family owned franchise and you do get that authentic feeling when you walk in an order. Pricey I must say but food is good."}
{"text":"So here we go with another Italian sandwich place. Overall this place is good. They have your average favourites. Veal, meatballs and sausage. There is a place to eat in that seats 20 people and a couple unsafe patio picnic tables outside. Parking is always an issue here. With lots of places to eat I have passed  this place by in the past for no place to park. Can't complain to much about the food but they do take the easy rout. I have met the owner and he likes to argue instead of accommodating people. My biggest problem is with my all time go to sausage on a bun. These guys have the sausage swimming in sauce. You don't put tomato sauce on sausage. His reason is it will dry out. I have it at least once a week at other places and they have it in onions and some liquid. Never dry. This guy is just lazy. The pricing is fair you are going to spend between eight and $12 for lunch. It's located in an industrial complex so if you were going to pick this place as a destination you will need to drive there see and if you don't like it you're going to have to drive someplace else see"}
{"text":"The best veal sandwich in Mississauga! Can't go wrong with the breaded chicken either."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sandwiches but living close to this place and hearing a lot of good things, i just had to try it and see for myself. 

Its a bit challenging getting inside the plaza if your coming from the opposite side and you have to make a left turn. Mavis is always busy! 

Upon entering this place on a Thursday night, it was very quiet and we were immediately greeted. We placed our order first and then you can grab your seat and they will deliver it to you. Great service, no complaints.

I ordered the eggplant parm with onion and mushrooms and my boyfriend ordered veal parmesan with onions and mushrooms. The veal/eggplant+ veggie + bun ratio is perfect. The bread is soft, the eggplant is filling and has full of flavour, veal was tasty and tender. Not chewy at all. The mushroom and onions gave both of the sandwhiches another tasty dimension. Their foods great!

The seats by the window have a really strong draft that made my sandwich go from hot to cold in minutes. I had to switch chairs a couple of times like a crazy person. Pick the table seats.

Overall great place for a quick bite!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area so I finally was able to try this place! Customer service is awesome and the restaurant is nice and clean! 

Now for the food... I ordered the famous veal my fellow yelpers always talk about. I ordered the small size with onions, peppers and mushrooms. The veal shocked me... It was surprisingly tender and very flavourful! The toppings were nice as well. This is very similar to \"California sandwiches\". 

Only criticism: they've recently raised the prices as per a sign. The small veal sandwich is 5.50 but after all the toppings it comes to $9 for a sandwich alone... I find this a little steep... Is it worth $9?? I don't think so. Will I be back? Perhaps if I'm craving veal and in the area."}
{"text":"My go-to veal sandwich spot in Mississauga. It's close to my place and delivers a quality product.

Expect friendly service from the owner and his wife and generally good wait-times. There's a good amount of seating although it can get a tad busy at lunch time, so it may be better for take out at times. 

The sandwiches are extra tasty. Crusty kaiser buns aren't over-soaked in the sauce, itself not oily or thin. The meat is freshly cooked and the toppings are tasty and generous, although not overloaded which makes for a less sloppy sandwich. Side olives are a good choice if you want something extra, but don't expect to leave hungry.

I only wish they had longer hours and were open Sundays, but the owners have young kids so I understand their reasons. 

All said, never had a bad one here and worth a visit if you're and fan of big spicy Italian goodness."}
{"text":"This was a great discovery thanks to Yelp! The junior size sandwiches are perfect for lunch. I tried the chicken with cheese and mushrooms, medium spiciness. The sauce they use is really flavourful and the chicken was nice and crispy. The sides, including olives and salumi looked great too. The place is clean and friendly and seems pretty popular with workers from the area and people taking stuff to go. I would be back next time I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Note:  Parking lot can be quite full especially during the day, lunch time rush, with cars from Metal Works.  So be prepared to park a bit further down in the plaza.  Easy to access if you're going North on Mavis Rd.  Otherwise, be prepared to make a left-hand turn through 3 lanes of fast traveling traffic.

Solid sandwich place!  

I've never been to Cali Sandwiches, so I cannot compare.  However, I did grow up eating at Italian bakeries, so this place is sorta nostalgic of that - minus the warming plates with the food that needs to be turned over!

I was leaving my gym, had to be somewhere else, knew that I had no food at home, so wanted to grab something quick, so I stopped here.  I ordered a jr. sized sandwich and the lady behind the counter was nice enough to explain the difference between the smaller (~$6) vs. larger size (~$7.50, bigger bun, 2 slices of veal).

There were some toppings, but they weren't free.  I think once upon a time, a few years ago, they did have a list of free toppings, but have done away with that.  Price-wise toppings were bad, mushrooms were $0.88.  The only thing that you can choose is spice-level:  mild, medium, & hot.  Medium did have a kick!

Veal was nice 'n thin with a crispy coating.  Best if eaten fresh as the coating would get soggy.  Very good and fresh tasting.  They have seating, but most people do takeout."}
{"text":"I must have passed this place literally thousands of times, as it's just around the corner from my house (not sure why I keep missing all these great places only to find them years after they open, but I digress...). I guess I just didn't expect anything good among all those warehouses. 

The place is small-ish, clean and the owners are super friendly. The menu is similar to that of California Sandwiches but the food is so much better! I'm in love with their veal sandwich (hot, with mushrooms and cheese, of course). The portions are large and very reasonably priced. On-A-Bun has definitely become one of my family's regular spots for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great place for veal sandwiches. Ordered the regular-sized sandwich combos (one veal, the other eggplant parmesan) for me and my boyfriend sometime in December. The place gets really packed during lunch time so do try to come as early as possible. I came when the lines were starting to grow, but the staff were doing a good job handling the lunch crowd. The sandwiches themselves were huge and very satisfying. You can choose to substitute sides with either chips, Nutella and Go snacks and bananas last time I went."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwiches in Mississauga! The staff are friendly, space is clean and the veal tender, authentic and fried to perfection! Their one downfall is that they are only open until about 7pm most days."}
{"text":"Took my daughter for lunch. The ordering was easy and fast with the food served up quick. The food itself was very good, I had the steak and my daughter the meatball and we both really enjoyed. The reason for the one star off is all the tables were dirty with no one cleaning them in between customers which is not cool. I would go back and hope the dirty tables was just and off day."}
{"text":"I love me some veal
Went to this little spot during my lunch break.
Good things..veal taste great,  you can get it sweet mild or spicy, you can dine in or take out, service is quick and friendly.

Cons..must pay extra for all toppings, I found it extremely cold inside so had to take to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant popped on my radar as I trekked my way to T&T.  Close to the intersection of Mavis and Burnhamthorpe and yet hidden behind the large ESSO gas station, this restaurant has a large signage that screams 'Italian Sandwiches'.  I was ready to feast on a delicious version of a veal parmigiana on soft bread.  This place did not disappoint.

The atmosphere is typical of most Italian small business... a warm and energetic owner solo manning the counter and kitchen in a clean but sparsely decorated and pragmatic environment.  It's not a glamourous place (how can you find glamour between an Esso and a Metalworks sound studio) but the service made up for it.

I was ready to order the veal but the owner sweet talked me into the chicken.  I saw him take TWO!! fresh raw chicken breast that was flattened and breaded and start cooking  immediately.  I asked for rappini and sweet peppers as well as I love my vegetables.  They cost a bit extra but I love my veggies.  I also asked for their daily soup special.

I sat down and looked about for a few minutes before the soup arrived hot.  The soup was a chicken vegetable and for $5, I would pass next time.  It was a small cup size and the flavour wasn't there.  It tasted 'real' but not a lot of flavours were jumping out at me.  It was a bit on the bland side.

As for the sandwich, dear gosh... I dont think I can finish the regular size myself.  It came up to $9 and change with tax all in.  The two chicken pieces were juicy, tender, and well seasoned.  The bun was fluffy and soft.  The vegetables were a great compliment to the chicken.  I ordered medium as I don't know the 'heat' level of this place.  I would say it's more mild/medium so I think I'll order hot next time.  Great sandwich because it was freshly made.  

This is definitely a nice gem to find in Mississauga and would recommend to those in the spot looking for a good Italian sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Large portions for a fair price. Lots of toppings to choose from. Staff is friendly and helpful. Will be back to this location again for  quick lunch!"}
{"text":"On-a-bun is located in the Metal Works plaza which I passed it plenty of time but didn't try it until today. I wished I did in the past!! 

Happy:  They have junior and regular size \"California sandwiches\" which is nice to see if you don't have a big appetite. I had the veal junior with sweet peppers and it was the right size. The bread wasn't was chewy and it did get soggy quickly. 

There's a small clean section to sit on in front of the counter, on dark wooden chairs. 

Not happy:  I ordered their butternut squash which was only $2.  Yes it was hot, but not creamy enough - a bit watery. At least it wasn't salty! 

Verdict:  It was good for the price that I paid (compared to California Sandwich in Heartland) and it wasn't as busy. It will make your tummy happy!"}
{"text":"omg funny story actually... So I work in the Metalworks building, which is right next to On-A-Bun. 

TODAY was suppose to be special. I brought TWO lunch boxes. Spaghetti in one.. and mac & cheese in the other. I ate some small breakfast this morning so I was real excited to eat them!!!!!

BUT THEN.. I found that I DIDN'T BRING MY FORK... sad face!!!!

My depression has then made me walk out of the office.... and on to On-The-Bun, for their above-my-price-range $6 sandwiches. It was also raining really hard, and I JUST finished drying my shoes.

So there I was.. looked at the menu... Junior Sandwiches for $4 and $4.75. I didn't want to cheap out so I ordered a Junior Chicken Sandwich (which I know will be big enough for me), $4.75 plus mushrooms ($0.66). Plus tax and $1 tip, it was about $7 something. 

The man who took my order, oh my goodness, he was so nice! He asked, \"Sweet, Medium, or Hot?\" I LOVE spicy food, but unfortunately I can't eat a lot of it hahhaha!! So I said, \"How hot is your Medium?\"
\"If you usually eat spicy foods, then medium isn't spicy at all.\"
\"ohh.. okay, well I don't take spiciness very well\" (or something along that line..)
\"Oh sure, I could ask the kitchen for a Sweet/Medium combo spiciness\" (okayyy, he said something much cooler than that. I just translated it dumb, sorry sorry!)

So I sat at the table... texted friends.... and he came over to give me my sandwich :') which turned out to be like BIGGER than a McDonalds-sized burger, and I ordered a JUNIOR :)!

and it was SOOOO delicious!!! The buns were amazing, and the chicken was amazing, the mushrooms were also amazing... the sweet & medium spicy was REALLY great. OMG I SUCK at describing food! It was just reeally really good! It was a bit spicy, and actually PERFECT for me! Lucky I didn't get MEDIUM spicy!

Will definitely go back when I save up enough to eat a lunch there again! I'm not cheap.. I'm dead broke and am working at an unpaid internship. If I WERE cheap, I'd probably just tip them $1for a plastic fork, right :)?"}
{"text":"Best Veal Sandwich ! ! !

The sandwich was grea! no chewy, fatty pieces, just great meat. 
The olives are really good too, on the side
Service was great, very friendly.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Better then California sandwiches hands down,also way better prices,great place to grab a bite"}
{"text":"Customer service is A1 at this small Italian Eatery.  If you're looking for a quick freshly made lunch with an authentic Italian touch this is the place for you.  All the staff work hard but somehow always mange to come up for air and give a warm smile to their customers in appreciation for their business.  About three times a year I order a variety of sandwiches for the guys down the road working at our Scrap Yard and they look forward to chowing down all the goodness including a specially-made Caesar salad for 10,  green olives Calabrese style, and cured sausage.  Sandwiches are extremely filling even wo the toppings.  Eating in or taking out has always been a pleasant experience.  Don't let all the students hanging outside the place discourage you from coming.   It's well worth it, even when it's busy.  Fresh is King !"}
