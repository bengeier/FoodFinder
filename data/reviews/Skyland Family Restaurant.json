{"text":"I agree with most of the other reviewers except for the comment about \"The South.\"  I think that was flat out rude. 

Anyway, the Skyland restaurant will not blow you away.  The food is good, cheap and somewhat fast.  It's your typical diner, kind of weak coffee, overcooked sausage and thin white bread.  I typically get the Skyland Special.  Try the pancakes, I think they are perfect - not too fluffy and not too heavy.  

The atmospehere is eactly what any diner is - a bit loud if the the wrong people are there and eccelctic.  

Go there as an alternative to a chain breakfast restaurant and you will be happy.  Go there expecting crepes and you will not."}
{"text":"Incredibly large selection on the menu and open 24 Hours a day.  Great service and great food.  A Charlotte classic that you will go to over and over.   Even your first time they will treat you like a regular."}
{"text":"I love my dives.  I love uncomplicated food served well in a welcoming environment.  I went early on a Tuesday morning.  I like the handwritten special board.  Saves time.  Maybe 4 other people in the whole place.  Staff could have been slacking but not.  I was pleasantly greeted and sat a comfortable booth quickly.  I placed my order with a server that was welcoming and friendly without being annoying.  She seemed to know exactly when my coffee needed refilling and was never intrusive.  I had the meatlovers omelette.  HUGE. Comes with toast and hash browns. A lot of food.  As for value:  Even with a generous tip you'll spend less than the same at IHOP.  Breakfast shouldn't be fussy.  It should be quick, affordable and well executed in a warm environment.  That's what you'll get at Skyland."}
{"text":"First timer! First impression is everything and Tabitha, our waitress, was amazing.  Very attentive and hospitable. The way a true diner should feel like! Highly recommend coming here, great  menu selection and the quality of food far exceeds itself."}
{"text":"I went to Skyland for breakfast at lunchtime with a few friends, one of whom was a Skyland regular several years ago. I consider myself quite the connoisseur of breakfast food. Not only do I make a good breakfast, but I have had more than my fair share out, so I take breakfast pretty seriously. At Skyland, I was not overwhelmed, but certainly not disappointed.  I love that it is 24/7 breakfast service, which makes it better than a lot of places, in my opinion. I had grits, toast, and a veggie omelette. The grits were good--pretty thick.  I generally prefer runnier grits, but I nearly polished these off with no problem. The omelette was alright. Not well-seasoned, but did have tons of veggies that seemed pretty fresh.  I also stole a few onion rings from my friend, which were like normal onion rings you would find anywhere.

I got a chicken parmesan sub to go for my husband.  He said he would definitely have it again, then went on a long tirade about how difficult the 5-star system is.  He decided that 7-out-of-ten stars would be perfect for this sub.  I stopped listening after that. 

My friends got the same sub--an Italian sandwich, with really thick sliced salami and sausage. One loved it, one did not.  So, just make sure you like thickly-sliced sausage before ordering.  I heard that the banana pudding was also excellent (though I hate fake banana taste, so I wouldn't touch it.)

The atmosphere was enjoyable, if only for the kitsch factor.  Our waitress was attentive, but not annoying, which I always enjoy.  I will definitely be going back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends one night after we got out of a seminar. This place is opened 24 hours I believe so if you're looking for a late night dine in restaurant besides your Ihop and Denny's this would be the place to go. I had their homemade lasanga dish and it was delicious! 

The service is not as great at night (after midnight) and you'll start to see a whole bunch of drunk/dramatic people coming in around 1-2am. I think the experience would've been better if I went during the day. But overall they have a good choice of food on their menu."}
{"text":"After the disappointment of seeing the Mad Greek closed at 10:45 pm, this seemed to be the only late night option in the area near my hotel.  Not sure how people give positive reviews of their Gyro.  Not that the Tzatziki sauce was rotten, it just was not Tzatziki sauce.  It was more like mayo.  Staff was friendly; service was rather fast, given that there were only 8 people in the entire restaurant.  Would have given one star without the kindness.  Did see a large plate of Baked Spaghetti on the way out that looked good, but who knows?"}
{"text":"I disagree with the previous reviewer about the hash browns. My were barely brown at all and slimy. The Skyland Breakfast is a great deal but if I were to order one thing it would probably be pancakes. They were quite good. Overall, I expected it to be greater than it was but you get what you pay for. I still am pleased I went here instead of the nearby IHOP for breakfast. Wrestling pics were WAY cool."}
{"text":"Food was cold and tasteless, service was extremely slow. Had to ask for coffee three times before it was brought out to the table. The waitress had no professionalism, she coughed all over a customer, and disappeared often. We waited about 25 min for our food, the place was empty, and we only ordered eggs and hash-browns. I honestly didn't think a restaurant would be bad enough to ruin eggs. Table next to us had the same issue, overheard them complaining. If I was confident that the waitress would get the manager in a timely fashion I would have asked, but I really didn't feel like spending another 30 min waiting. The population of charlotte has changed, I think the restaurant needs to adapt to those changes. Get a new cook, and better front of house service, or provide training so they know what to do."}
{"text":"Skyland is a slight time warp for long time Charlotte residents like me.  It's one of the original blue plate places on South Blvd that are gone now as the corridor has in filled over the last decade with apartments and condos and shopping centers.  

Best Gyro in town and love the choices for their vegetable plates.  Lots of regulars here and  owners dedicated to this town and the neighorhood.   A definite throw back to \"meat and three.\""}
{"text":"Very efficient career waitresses, some a little more pleasant than others but very competent. Menu for breakfast was good variety.  $25 for three breakfasts - Belgian waffle, French toast, and Skyland special (comes w pancake n coffee along w regular 2 egg, side n meat choice). Decent grits, I like mine slightly sweeter than they served. Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Skyland multiple times. Overall it is great and I continue to go back. The service is a mixed bag, some times it is fast, sometimes slow.  The food is always good and with large portions. The cost is very reasonable.  For an affordable family restaurant i would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love Skyland Diner. I have been coming here since high school and I will be 40..oops...lol..telling my age;-) I have always enjoyed coming here because everyone is always so nice and, they make you feel like family. When ever I come home to visit this is one of the places I enjoy eating at. Let me tell you...if you guys are ever in Charlotte to visit or already live in Charlotte, I encourage you to check out Skyland Diner. I was there yesterday and ordered the veggie plate. I chose the 4 item plate. Since I really love their squash, I always ask them to fry them hard for me. This is what I ordered with cabbage. If you order the squash try them with their homemade ranch dressing as a dipping sauce. You will enjoy them. Prices are reasonable and you get large portions of food. I have also had their stuffed cabbage rolls which are only available on their Saturday menu. They are very good and filling. They give you two big cabbage rolls. Check out Skyland Diner  when you have the chance;-) Many blessings to you all;-)"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! 
We come here often and enjoy good food and friendly staff. 
The food is not the best we had, but its consistent. 
We like the comfort and casual dining. 
Big portions, lots of choices. 
I love how they bring a cup of soup for both people, even if only one ordered it. 
Great spot, family owned, community feel."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place yesterday while in town on business. I was skeptical at first, as it is not much to look at on the outside and it was not too crowded. In all fairness, however, it was an off-peak meal time around 3.  In short -good food!  I had the party melt/fries and it did not disappoint. Service was great. My wife and daughter stopped by this morning and said breakfast was great -and a huge amount of food for the money! I would definitely return if in the area again."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of a place for lunch and dinner, Skyland wouldn't be my top choice, or my second choice. Their food is decent, I won't say it's good or bad, just decent. It is by far the best place open past 11pm though. Their breakfast is pretty good I will say, and they serve it 24/7. It's very affordable with most items about 5 - 9 dollars. 

Breakfast 4/5 stars
Lunch/Dinner 2/5 stars
Afterhours Dining 5/5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been a Skyland fan even before I moved over to the south side of Charlotte. I work nights and pretty much been a night owl most of my life so I have a special place in my heart for 24/7 restaurants you can get a decent meal at outside of the chain places (Waffle house, IHOP, Denny's) and late night fast food can be downright depressing. It's a greek style, family owned\operated type place so I usually see the same familiar faces no matter when I choose to visit but it's usually late a night after a night of roaming around on the town and i get an attack of the munchies. They have both a breakfast & dinner menu with great variety and always available at any time. Prices aren't necessarily super cheap but fairly reasonable for the amount of food they give you is certainly worth it. I tend to be in a breakfast mood when I dine there but i've had many selections off both menu's and have been satisfied with everything I've picked. Word to the wise, if you don't want to be bothered with potential rowdy patrons you may not want to dine there after 2am especially on the weekends you will run into alot of after the club patrons not too mention the place gets pretty packed. Still get pretty solid service even when it gets busy and police usually dine and hang around quite a bit so they usually take care of the edgy element if it happens to arise. Not the most flashy place on the inside, a few tv's nice sized dinning area, never really have a trouble getting a seat. Not the most intimate setting for a date but a good hangout spot to meet up with friends. I hope the establishment continues to stick around for years to come :-)"}
{"text":"Really solid place, with great hours! I got the steak sandwich which was great! Friendly wait staff and a family diner feel.  Nothing special, but also no real complaints. I would highly recommend this place for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Skyland is a good option in 2 different scenarios: 1-After you've been out drinking and dancing and you're ravenous. OR  2-It's past 11pm and most other things in Charlotte have stopped serving food.

It's a pretty typical diner. Outdated decor but lots of booths. The menu is a decent size. Lots of Greek and Italian options in addition to the breakfast menu. They have a few vegetarian options,  but not many.

I really love the fried squash here! It's their shining star! And the servers are always sweet and helpful.

The rest of the food quality really depends on who the cook is that night. I've had omelettes at Skyland that I could have done flips over, but other times they are dry and lackluster."}
{"text":"We went here because it was recommended by our hotel. We were shocked that the hotel recommended it because it was really bad. 

Really bad as in nothing on the table was good. 

My group actually wondered if someone paid our hotel attendant to recommend it. I find myself wondering the same thing about other reviews here. I cannot fathom how this place garnered a single even mediocre review.

*Update 3/7/18

After getting on 3 years the best customer service this place can provide is a snarky, rude response. No \"We're sorry\". No \"How can we improve?\" just an attack. 

This is the kind of terrible customer service you can expect at this place. Take your money, family and pallet elsewhere. Go literally anywhere else. You will be better for it."}
{"text":"A staple of Charlotte nightlife, Skyland offers great food, reasonable prices, and a relaxed atmosphere for those 3 a.m. munchies.  

On the flip side, Sunday breakfast with the family never tasted so good and your parents will thank you for giving their wallets a break :)"}
{"text":"the guy that works register is always there..and u can tell he is visably tired but always gives great service..And food is always on point"}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested by a friend because they know my husband is a \"breakfast\" fanatic. He likes all varieties, pancakes, eggs, grits, biscuits, ham, bacon, French toast, omelets, etc. You get the idea.  
It was nice to walk in and be greeted immediately by someone with a smile and hello.   It wasn't very crowded but the restaurant is large and roomy. There were people picking up takeout orders and others eating in.  
Prices were very reasonable. I ordered a \"senior breakfast\" (scrambled egg, bacon, hash browns and biscuits).  It was more than my appetite could handle.  Husband chose 2 eggs, grits, toast and ham. The slice of ham filled the plate.  Refills on the coffee and pop were always replenished without having to ask.  
Needless to say, we will be returning on our next visit to the area. I would like to try something off the lunch or dinner menus."}
{"text":"It was.ni e.and.cozy. the staff is nice.and the food is good. The.wi gs.were great. I got the hot turkey and it was okay."}
{"text":"Omg this place has the best breakfast ever the breakfast taste very homemade which I love and the portion size is also decent as well. And the prices are very decent I've never tried their lunch or dinner menu but I'm sure it's pretty good as well. If you don't feel like cooking breakfast this is definitely the spot to go to. And the inside is huge with lots of tables and the wait staff is always friendly and attentive to their customers if you haven't tried it I definitely recommend that you do you won't be disappointed at all!!!"}
{"text":"One of two diners open 24 hrs that I have so far discovered in Charlotte.  So 3 stars just for being open all night.  On Sunday nights when absolutely nothing is open after 10pm, it's your best, if only, bet for a quick hot meal that's not fast food.  Not that it's any healthier.  But you can sit down to eat and they have a wide selection on their menu.

That said, eating here will very quickly remind you that you are firmly located in the South.  Not every restaurant in town has to be metro chic, and ruffians can be found in any city.  But be prepared to deal with loud, ignorant people, especially in their mid 20's with no manners and no respect for you, the restaurant or themselves any night of the week.  For some people the barn door is always open."}
{"text":"My brother and I were super hungry and found this place.. Staff was cool and one of the Panthers came in.."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Skyland's for years and it's always great! We usually come for breakfast as a family. You never know who you're going to run into. This place and The Original Pancake House (South Park) are historic landmarks! Great food with a home cooked feel/taste at cheap prices! Ask for Stacey. She's lovely with a great personality. Be ready for her, as she is a feisty one who loves to joke :)
p.s.
I recommend the Skyland Special for 6.95."}
{"text":"Service has always been wonderful but the food is mediocre and way overpriced for it's  [lack of] \"quality\"... which sucks considering they have a lot to chose from on their menu. Sadly even the desserts are bland. I only continue to go here because it's 24hrs, the noise level is minimum, it doesn't have the riff-raff at night like the Midnight Diner does [probably because this is a popular spot for cops to eat at], Denny's is too far out to drive to (I stay on the other side of town), and I hate iHop."}
{"text":"What can I say? This was one of a very few places opened late-late in the QC, so it gets the job done. The portions are large, yet the flavor is just ok. The service was pretty decent as well as the prices. May go back in the future, but it will not be number one on my list of options. I know Charlotte is no DC or NYC, but we really could use more variety for late night dining."}
{"text":"This is a really good breakfast spot. Lunch and dinner are good as well. Open 24 hours. Today I had the meat lovers omelette special with hash browns and it was just right. Also very reasonably priced. A little behind the times though, no wifi."}
{"text":"When you don't expect much and a place delivers big than you can get excited. At almost 1 AM while laid over from a delayed flight I hit them up because it was walking distance from the hotel. I had not eaten anything for half the day with flight issues and probably anything would have tasted good, but they did better than good.

This restaurant is not far from the Four Points Hotel and they recommended it since everything else had long closed except for the strip joints and the 24 hour Skyland Family Restaurant. I really did not care, I was just so starved and needed FOOD!

I walked the couple minute trek and found the restaurant easily. The sidewalk was clear and there was actually business at this time of the morning. It was hard to get a vibe for the area since everything was dark, but there were other businesses within sight. I walked through the doors and was immediately greeted by a woman who seated me at a booth. Not long after a male waiter came by and offered coffee, water and a menu. Within what seems seconds drinks were on the table. The coffee was solid.

When the waiter came back with drinks I took no time to let him know that I was exhausted and just needed to eat, but preferred breakfast and asked for a recommendation. Some sort of combo with eggs, meat, another side and pancakes were offered. I decided on sausage patties and grits to accompany the meal. The waiter was friendly and it was refreshing after a really bad day at the airport.

I took a look around the dining room and it was set up with booths on the exterior walls. and interior middle. Seating capacity was pretty good and from what I could see it was tidy. There were various wall hangings which made it feel more comfortable. It was a standard diner place I guess, I was too tired to remember more details. 

My breakfast came out so fast I thought it had to be a mistake and someone elses. But oh no, they rushed it through because I said how hungry I was and boy was it appreciated. The food smelled great and I was ready to dig in, but which first. Well I hit up the grits off the bat, something I don't often order. They were delicious, but so was everything and temperature was nice and hot.  My waiter checked up on me twice and provided a coffee refill.

My area was cleared quickly of dirty dishes upon finishing and the check was in hand to check out. I found the bill to be almost a mistake, it was so reasonable for the amount of food. The woman up front when paying was also friendly and we chatted a few minutes about all the wrestling memorabillia on the wall. The owner is a HUGE fan of wrestling. So, if anyone wants to talk wrestling come in during the day and he will bend your ear off I imagine. 

I have no idea about the rest of the menu, but my meal was definitely quality. The service was about as good as you could possibly get. The place was clean and they offer 24 hour dining which was a bonus for me. I can imagine there lunch and dinner meals are pretty darn good too! The pies in the case as I headed out looked yum. They are doing this right at the Skyland."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. The service is spot on,  and the owners are involved with helping our community. The omelettes are the best!! I have never had to wait more than one minute to get seated. I also love that Skyland is open 24 hours. It's the closest thing to a diner that the south side has."}
{"text":"Insanely fast service, very friendly people and great prices. I want to give it four stars for those very reasons but all in all, I think this place is a solid three. My wife and I ate at this place twice and this is what we had:

Souvlaki Pita with fries. The souvlaki was seasoned nicely and the tzatziki was great. Although the pita's were not made in house it was very, very soft. Great pita sandwich. The fries were average. It also came with a cup of veggie soup (soup of the day) that was very good. This plate is a win. 

Open face roast beef plate. I believe the mashed potatoes were instant but my wife enjoyed it and that is what mattered. I tried a bite of the roast beef with bread and gravy and it was good. This is more of a comfort food plate and one that I would recommend if you want something more bland. Don't get me wrong, it has flavor, but it is just simple.

Baked spaghetti with meat sauce. This was a huge plate of pasta smothered in melted cheese. It was good but not by any means traditional Italian. It came with bread and a salad and the salad was good.

Last but not least, 8oz ribeye with a baked potato & salad. My wife got the red French dressing which they said was made in house and my wife loved it. She really enjoyed the steak as well. 

Bottom line, this place has good food not great food but the portions are big, the price is low and it is open 24hrs. This place would be a regular late night spot for me if I lived here."}
{"text":"The food was good but the management was very rude to the server we had who was waiting on 12 tables by herself at one point. His friends came in from a church service and all of them were terrible to our server who was a older woman. She later told me that they are usually like that and she can't do anything about it. I thought it was bad for the owner to condone such behavior among his friends."}
{"text":"BRUTAL!  ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL!


- Yes, its cheap.  But if that's the best and the only thing of note you can say about a place, that's hardly a ringing endorsement.  

- Went there today, Aug. 28th and did not find the service fast at all, or maybe the food was so bad I couldn't wait to get out of there.  

- My gf said the turkey sausage tasted like soap.  Bacon had a horrible aftertaste.  Felt like someone searched out the cheapest, lowest quality breakfast meats they could find.

-Pancakes were cold.  The table-side, room temperature butter, already at the table; didn't melt.  

Hashbrowns were barely cooked and weren't crisp at all.


***For final bill of $16.94 (WHICH ISN'T CHEAP BTW!) before tip, I feel ripped off and duped.  My girlfriend and I were so disappointed that we left and went down South Blvd a little and grabbed some Einstein's Bagels just to get the Skyland out of our pallet.**

GO HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"}
{"text":"Worst meal in years i ordered the steak with gravy and mushrooms which is exactly how they have it wrote in the menu. To my surprise they bring out a disgusting flat burger covered in gravy i took one bite and thought i was going to throw up. Also had mac n cheese as a side and it looked like cafeteria food that was sitting for hours i payed and left and will never return and i make sure everyone i no never visits this restaurant ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the place and the people. The food was pretty good! Everyone was welcoming and very friendly!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food. We never got food or drinks or had a waitress acknowledge us after sitting there for 20 minutes. I won't be going back to try the food.  They blew it."}
{"text":"Great family-friendly neighborhood diner. This neighborhood isn't one we'd normally visit, but if we're in the area, we'd definitely suggest it. We ambled in as a suggestion from our hotel staff. Walked in & it felt like a homey, kitschy Greek family restaurant. Great breakfast menu available all day. I was glad our server was efficient, friendly, and extremely accommodating. She anticipated our needs, which is so rare these days. Ordinarily, we have to request extra things for our toddler (i.e highchair, extra plate, cup with a lid), but our server had these items out to us before we even thought to ask. I even asked for lunchtime menu about 30 min prior to the breakfast service ended. She made no fuss about asking the cook, and they were all glad to accommodate."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped here for breakfast while on vacation in Charlotte and we loved it. The waitress was very attentive: making sure we had drink refills before we even finished the first (which went over very well with my husband).  The food was excellent.  THe food portions were huge (I didn't finish the plate) and I was able to take the rest home to eat at the hotel later.  And the prices were super cheap.

The only reason that I don't give this rating 5 stars is because of the hostess...  Maybe she was having an off day.... She pretty much ignored us when we walked through the door even though there was no one else around, we had to speak to her first before she acknowledged us.  And even then there was no \"Hey\", \"How you doin?\" Nothin. Just \"How many?\"  (There's still no one else around...) After we told her \"2\", she just walked off... No \"right this way\", \"follow me\" Nothin...... 

Needless to say our mood wasn't dampered for long, the rest of the experience was perfect."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere. Good place to bring mother on Mother's Day. I like the breakfast all day. Would come back. Server could have been a little nicer but in no way was rude or unpleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"This is a great little family diner w/personality - wrestling memorabilia on the wall at the entrance, murals on the walls.  Standard breakfast offerings & wonderful service.  The only thing is that cooking spray that is used to crisp hash browns.  I hate it & no amount of ketchup covers it up.  The only recommendation I would make is find a way to eliminate that to crust up the hash browns."}
{"text":"Ok they've earned another star because the food is just damn tasty for a VERY reasonable price! Finally found a place my Depression Era Dad could relate to.....it's what we call \"a Greek joint\" in Chicago....MEANING, a restaurant RUN by Greeks (with a couple of Greek items on the menu as well). 

I got the chopped beefsteak with onions and gravy. The beef was pounded flat and done crispy which I loved! Very good flavor profile too. Came with fries which were decent.

Dad got the BLT, fries and a cup of soup. The soup was a veggie soup and was VERY good. 

Waitress was a tad \"crusty\" but efficient.

Overall this is a very good option if you want a hearty, homestyle meal or a late nite feast."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant in charlotte.  I recommend the onion rings, greek salad, greek chicken, the hot roast beef ( no mayo), patty melt, and just about anything else.   

Open 24/7/365. You got to love that right?   

Be kind to the wait staff and tip well.  They work hard there."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places, we come here almost once a week it seems! We live just down the road and love the fact that they are open 24 hours. We have a tradition of coming out for breakfast before work on payday, and since we both work early that usually means breakfast at about 4am lol. Excellent staff, they know the regular customers and are super friendly and chatty. The food is basic comfort-type food but well made and tasty. They keep your coffee cup full and will even give you drinks to go if you want. Love this place, definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Skyland! I love there country style steak and rice! Also great banana pudding like Mama made!!"}
{"text":"Skyland is the best 24 hour diner in town.  This place is family owned and has the typical huge menu and 24 hour breakfast.  This place is also great for breakfast any day of the week, and unlike many 24 hour joints, it isn't creepy, so feel free to go with your family.  The service is fast and the prices are low."}
{"text":"Family owned 24 hour restaurant with reasonable prices. 
Unfortunately the food is pretty bland and the cleanliness is questionable (food stains on the walls and room divider blinds and support columns).
Also everything was essentially swimming in grease. 
Not horrid, but would not recommend and will not return. I would choose Waffle House over this place."}
{"text":"This little 24 hour place was awesome! We showed up at 2:30 with 22 people (including 18 very hungry teenagers) and they were completely sweet and prompt about seating and serving us. The food was great (especially the grits) and the servers were so nice!"}
{"text":"The staff are very pleasant and the food is great. Reminds of a classic Jersey diner."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is always open when you want to go out to eat even when nothing else is open. I love the art and the history on the walls when I come in, it is obvious this place has been around for a while. They're open on all holidays too! The waitresses are so nice and friendly, definitely make you feel like you've been coming here for years.

The food is awesome. The Skyland special is a great deal. 
The only thing that was off is that the hash browns are a little bland, but definitely so good. Definitely one of my new favorite diner spots, and they have a good Christmas breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving it five stars for being great at what it is. A place you can go any hour and get a decent meal, from decent people. Every time I come here to eat, I always feel welcome. The staff and owners are such nice people. The food is always good as well. I love the cabbage and hamburger steak personally."}
{"text":"One of the few 24 hour diners in Charlotte, Skyland has all your typical breakfast, American diner, Italian and Greek dishes. The food itself is marginally better than a Denny's or IHOP, although the menu is far more imaginative than those chains. Unfortunately, Skyland is in a HORRIBLE part of town, so if you go late at night try to park where you can see your car!"}
{"text":"Skyland has your average diner food in my opinion. It's a solid spot late at night/early in the morning when your options are limited. The menu holds a decent variety and the service was alright. The inside was clean and the sanitation grade was really high which is always a great sign."}
{"text":"The food was good. However...There were only a few parties at the restaurant and the waitress sat us (a party of 2) in the back buy a huge loud drunk party. We had a hard time hearing each other talk. I would give the place another chance based on the food....but terrible service."}
{"text":"Old school breakfast. $4.95 - two eggs, livermush and heaping hash browns!   24 hr!  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"What can i say. It was easter and everything was crowded. My friend took me here spur of the moment and there was no wait for a table. I had the grilled tips country dinner with 2 sides and a cup of soup for 9.95 which was a steal. When i tell u this is some good ass food!! Country style seasoned well flavorful ugh it was soo good. The waiter was amazing and friendly. My only downside why i didnt give it 5 stars was the booth we were sitting at was a bit dirty. Like coffee stains and juice stains everywhere. The blinds literally right next to you are dirty too. I guess the food does all the talking. Lol"}
{"text":"We are so happy to be here escaping the hurricane that is over our home near Tampa right now. Feeling very blessed. When we arrived, we immediately assumed that our waiter had a few drinks tonight. Given the hurricane, this was a much needed distraction. He took our drink order. Then took our drink order again. We said, \"just bring us wine. Anything red.\" As he took our meal order, he sat down at the table next to us. So sweet. He asked what kind of dressing with our salad that comes with the omelette we ordered. Whatever. Just bring us Italian. As he stumbled away, we realized how happy and blessed we are to be here eating food. And so what if there was a small eyelash on the lettuce?"}
{"text":"I gave this place four stars because the waitress named Lacey was amazing and so on top of things. The food was good but not great, But the prices were great!!! If I come back it will be for the great prices and amazing service that Lacey provided.   This place is not fancy by any means but it was clean from what I could see, and real laid-back.   The fried shrimp was good, lightly breaded so your mouth was full of shrimp and not bread which is a huge plus for me. It was also season well, kind of like a garlic mix.  The eggs were also good. French toast was very average but still better than what I could make at home."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service there is in Charlotte. I order the open roast beef sandwich and believe me it had been open for hours under a heat lamp. It was so tough, dried out and no taste that there was no way to eat it. I told the waitress and she went to the manager and told her. Waitress said she would be there in a minute which she never can after 30 minutes. I told the lady at the cash register (manager) and she looked at me like I was crazy. She asked if I told the waitress and I said yes and I watched her tell you. She never offered to do anything but take my money for food my dog wont eat. 

So that is the last time I go here or tell anyone to go there"}
{"text":"We were looking for a family cooking style place after 9pm & uptown games had let out. On the way home, saw this place and pulled in. Staff was incredibly friendly & super fast food. We will def be back! Great low key down home cookin kind of spot. Tons on the menu. Super casual"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. Breakfast any time.  Food was cooked perfectly. Everyone was great, even at 1am. Only ding is the wait staff seemed new which usually indicates a lot of turnover."}
{"text":"I went to Skyland growing up and used to love it. It was probably because it was the only 24 hour restaurant in charlotte at the time. I consider it drunk food. As in, it's delicious when you're intoxicated but not good other wise. Went Sunday morning at my fellow diners request. I ordered the Olympian omelette , which is the same thing I used to order . It used to be delicious and loaded with feta cheese. Today it was extremely dry, came out in a circle like it had been cooked in a mold and packed with hash browns. I literally ate less than an 8th of it it was so bad. The hash browns that came with it were good. The biscuit was good but very heavy. The place wreaked of smoke which I don't understand since you can't smoke there. I really won't be going back unless I need a late night snack. I'm not a fancy girl and don't need a fancy breakfast but the food was just terrible . I honestly should have sent it back but I hate to be that girl. If I go back, I will definitely change my order. Dine at your own risk."}
{"text":"Late night...that's all you need to know.  This place is a safe haven for those that don't want to mess with the long line at Midnight Diner.  Well, at least that's how I found out about it.  I've heard of it before but my lack of patience persuaded me to finally visit and I'm glad I did.

Standard family style dining approach here with BLT's, steak and eggs and breakfast served all day.  Awesome.   I had the meat omelet and sides of bacon and sausage.  It hit the spot and was to our table in under 15 minutes.  At 2:00 am that's all you really require.  

Don't expect much in terms of decor here.  It's a throwback to the 80's for the most part and easy to tell.  Who cares?

The downside of this location, is it's location relative to uptown for me but totally worth the cab ride if you ask me."}
{"text":"There is a difference between \"cheap\" and \"inexpensive.\" Skyland is the \"inexpensive\" part with low cost meals that are good quality and good quantity. I love that they are open 24 hours and in this part of town, that's a good thing. Short walk - quarter mile - from the Woodlawn Lynx station as well.

My daughter and I both opted for breakfast and were quickly served large portions and as much coffee as we could drink. My cheese and mushroom omelet had plenty of both. The hash browns were plentiful though you might want yours a little more well done.

Two full meals for $20 with tip. Hard to go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Depending on what time of day you'll have a really good waitress. The prices are a little high and the wait a little long but the food is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Sheraton just down the street, and walked here for a late breakfast after check out. The service was really great from the waitress I had,  and my omelette was tasty. Not much else to ask for.

A no-frills kinda diner open 24-hours with good food is a valuable resource in any city."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Impressed with the host. I found out he had been in restaurant business since 50s and had just been awarded long leaf pine. Nice people."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here because Sidelines bar next door doesn't serve food. I won't be going back any time soon.  It wasn't that the staff was unfriendly or unaccommodating (in fact, the foreign lady at the front was very nice, and one of the waitresses was off the clock and had us cracking up about somebody having stolen her cigarette--LOL), it wasn't that I was put off by the condition of the restaurant, there were no bugs that I could see, and every one seemed to be of sound mind--it was the food.  

The food was not good.

I ordered a chicken quesadilla, without the chicken, and some fries.  The quesadilla was mushy, tasteless with very little seasoning, and just bland.  The fries--you could get those anywhere; they are nothing to rave about.  My BF had the turkey and dressing and he didn't complain (too much) about it, but he's likely echo my comments.  It seems they lack food quality.  I normally would not have given this place another thought, but we were right there and we were hungry so we figured, 'Why not?'

They really have to improve the food quality; that likely wouldn't encourage me to return, but for others who like good ole Southern cooking, they'll probably be looking for more. It just didn't come close to meeting my expectations."}
{"text":"What...Breakfast all day :). Great and I mean great coffee and the service can't be beat. Wonderful meal with friends!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at this location I was super-excited based upon the reviews and the fact that I was in extreme hunger and to see something in the Charlotte area open around 1 a.m. in the morning is extremely rare. After being seated I noticed that our waitress had very poor hygiene. Her nails were black under them and her chipped nail polish ended up in my food when served. By no means do I generalize or stereotype someone based on the way they look however, every server with an exception of a few of the young girls look like crackheads we're serving my food... The food came out fast however,I lost my appetite based on the uncleanliness of my waitress.  Gross."}
{"text":"The food was good, prices matched the portions. Our waitress was great and she recommended her favorites. She was so sweet and attentive! Only reason I didn't give it 5stars, was due to the fact that the cashier lacked customer service skills and pretty much ignored us for a whole 2 minutes. She did not acknowledge us when our group walked up to pay our tab. Rather rude."}
{"text":"If they serve breakfast, I am instantly a fan.  I do like the mom and pop, \"hole in the wall\" feel to the place.  

Service was a bit slow when all the booths got full of people, but it was a decent 2 eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and 2 pancakes for 4.95 that I've had in Charlotte.

I came here after running a 5K... and I pretty much demolished my plate.  The only thing that was missing was coffee...but I wanted to attempt a nap that afternoon before having to stay up for a while that night."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Skyland. I've eaten here so many times and never reviewed... Shame on me! 

This Greek - American restaurant has just about anything you could want. Great comfort food! You can also get breakfast at any time of the day. I know I'm not the only one who craves an omelet and hash browns for dinner?! 

Also, this place is open 24/6 (they close early on Mondays for weekly cleaning). It's a fantastic alternative to IHOP (which is notorious for being packed at 2:30 am). Late night staff, my mother (Yes my mother) included, are always so nice. ((ASK FOR BARBARA!!!!)) HIGHLY recommend ;)

Like I said, can't go wrong at Skyland. I absolutely love their food!"}
{"text":"Great value and large portions. On my second visit to Skyland Family Restaurant, I brought my co-worker and friend Amber to have dinner. We were greeted and seated promptly by our server. Service was very fast and the portions were great. Decor and ambiance needs updating. You can order breakfast all day, and they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This would be the the kind of place I would normally like and, therefore, I have tried it several times.  The service was good and the people were friendly, but I found the vegetables to have an odd chemical taste to them.  Maybe it's just my taste buds, but the other reviewers seem to like it."}
{"text":"The food was great but our sever Barbara rocked it. 33 years in serving and she still takes pride in her work. Thank you for taking care of Miss Jennifer Holliday and our local crew. We all had a fantastic experience thanks to you. Different Roads Home ( a local charity) thanks you from the bottom of our hearts."}
{"text":"One of the foods I miss the most in Arkansas is livermush. I know it sounds revolting (it's actually called liver pudding, which sounds worse), but it is the BEST. THING. EVER. And I couldn't think of a better way to start my birthday than with a big breakfast at one of my favorite spots. I really love Skyland Restaurant. It's locally owned, not at all fancy, and just one of the best bargains in Charlotte. Graham had a Belgian waffle and a side of livermush, and I had scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits and livermush. For about $5.00. You can't beat that!

And breakfast was perfect. I hate runny eggs. HATE them. And these were absolutely perfect. They were just the right texture and had a ton of flavor. And the biscuit is one of the best I had while I was home. Everything was delicious, the service was insanely fast and I can't wait to go back again the next time I'm home."}
{"text":"I'm convinced that there is no better food at 2am than this place.  The Chicken Parm remains the best I've ever had.  We always come in with a group of 10 or more and still get great service.  When the sun is up, Charlotte does have some better eateries (but then Charlotte just has the best food in the US), but for 24 hour dining...this place is the king."}
{"text":"Came at around midnight, despite this quality definitely didn't drop. Food tasted great, the waitress was funny and they genuinely seemed happy to welcome us. That's what a lot of places get wrong, they forget that the customer matters and we definitely felt welcome."}
{"text":"Don't expect much from this place.  The food is edible and the service is OK.  Only go here late at night when there is nothing open, and here in Charlotte late night dining options are slim as hell."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. A couple of us ate at this place because we were going to an event next door. The service was extremely poor. We waited 30 minutes for our food. The person that checked us out was extremely rude. He got an attitude when I asked to see the bill again to make sure I was charged properly. I am paying for my food and I have every right to check my bill. They made it very clear that if you werent Greek, you werent wanted in their restaurant. I will NEVER eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We went back a second time because we thought the poor service and food was just a fluke. However, the waitress & hostess attitudes were still just as nasty as the food."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Makes you feel right at home. Food is very well made and great service at any time. Love the chicken parmigiana! Highly recommended. You get so much food for a small price. Also recommend the philly cheese steak. One of the best I have ever had"}
{"text":"My Dad and I love this restaurant. My Dad is from Charlotte. We live in Atlanta and visit to see relatives. We always get excited to come eat here while we're in town. They have a large selection, big portions, and good prices. They give complimentary soup. They offer a variety of dishes such as cabbage rolls, baked chicken, and various fresh cooked vegetable sides. The breakfast is even better. This place is opened at all hours. Definitely my go to when I'm in town. Consistently good after all these years."}
{"text":"If you are looking for your cheap basic diner food - this is the spot.

We recently came here for breakfast and it was very busy - I am from out of town so I am not sure if it is always like that but we ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table. Once we sat our waitress was very flustered and not very attentive.

I ordered the Feta Cheese Omelette and was disappointed. The egg was very dry and the omelette was broken in many places. The water also had an interesting earthy taste that I was not a fan of. The hash-browns were delicious however. 

Maybe I just went on a busy day at a busy time but, my first impression was not the best."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Skyland from time to time when he doesn't want to suffer through my quirky choices of cuisine and when we just want some decent Greek diner food. We usually get breakfast; or for lunch the cheeseburger deluxe and I'll get the gyro. Well, I thought I would change up and my husband got his usual cheeseburger deluxe and I ordered a cold roast beef sandwich on white bread. That seemed to be a problem because she asked several times if I wanted it on toast and then a bun. What's so hard about white bread?  It had to be the most awful meal both of us have had in a while. I specifically asked the waitress ( whom I've never seen before and was pretty abrupt) if the roast beef was rare and she unequivocally said yes. Sadly, the bread, although not toasted, obviously was under the heat lamp and was warm and NOT rare but actually warm. The slices were thick cut and grisly. My husband could not eat his cheeseburger as he said it was so overcooked. Specifically asked for well done fries, which I won't hold them accountable for since NO PLACE I ever ask for well done fries for ever gets it (except Chik fil la). When I tasted the lettuce on my sandwich and then his separated from the sandwich, it actually tasted like soap. We may go for breakfast if we are in the area and hungry for breakfast, but I will never go back for lunch under any circumstances. I'm pretty sad about it since it was a staple for us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit here frequently after he gets off work and Im going into work. With them being open 24 hours, It works out great with our schedules. The food is great and staff is awesome. We go there so much....They know us and where each of us work at. Like one big happy family. I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Open very late with a huge menu. Great for groups as well. Really appreciated the friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Classic Greek diner.  Everything is pretty cheap on the menu and really good.  Try the onion rings! Service is good too!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that the people that go to it just \"know about\". Which is why I never thought to write a review about it but it deserved it because even though it is not a place where you go because they have the best food in charlotte but you go because it is always consistent. I have been here more times than I can count and the experience is always the same. To be honest, I've only visited during the 12am-3am window. We come after a night out in uptown when you don't want to grab drive through food and you still want to continue the night with your friends because it's the only place that can accommodate late night tables of 6-8 people. Everyone is always friendly but you have to have some patience when waiting on your food. Everyone can come here because there are tons of choices, breakfast, Greek, your typical diner food and things that I'm always surprised about like baked spaghetti.  I love their Gyro plate or their biscuits and gravy!! 

One thing I know is true, if I am looking for a place to sit down and eat at any time of the night and everyone can find something for them. This is where I am going."}
{"text":"What better way to end a night of cocktails, billiards & fun with friends than BREAKFAST! 

Left Sidelines after having fun and this place was hit the spot.  The service was just ok, our waitress seemed to have to many tables or was overwhelmed as she didn't check on the table enough. I wasn't expecting superior service but the food was very good and worth a few more visits.

I'm a Belgium Waffle guy which was made to order, scrambled eggs & turkey sausage. Yummy!

Looking for an after hours diner type spot that can accommodate a group of friends, here's your spot. The checkout was extremely easy for a bigger crowd and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout meal over the phone and was told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes after it was placed. I arrived on time and waited patiently in line because there were other customers waiting to be cashed out, waiting on their order, or both like I was. Waited about 8 to 10 minutes in line waiting for someone to tell me if it was ready or when to pay. Front desk came back with three orders, mine being one of them. If it was ready, I don't understand why it took long for them to cash me out if it was already ready. Came home which is approximately 4 minutes away and the food was cold. I ordered chicken parmigiana and a tuna melt. The chicken parmigiana came with watery meat sauce that was just not good at all. It was also cold. It tasted like how it looked like. The tuna melt was not the best either, but the fries were soggy and cold. Called the store to complain and even offered to bring back the food to prove I wasn't lying. The lady who picked up ended up being the front desk and was absolutely rude. I did not attempt to offend her in any way and was just simply trying to fix my order or reorder something else. She called me a liar and said the food was probably cold because I live far. Like I said before I live approximately 4 minutes. She also called me a liar when I said that I come there sometimes and says she's never seen me before. I've ordered plenty times in the past and never had an issue with the food. The front desk has always been rude, but I've always ignored it until now simply because I would only see the lady when it came to pay and ask for my order. I have worked in customer service in the past and I know exactly how a customer or even a human being should be treated. That was the worst. To be called a liar when I have nothing to gain from it except for my order to be fixed. I was willing to bring my order back to the location but I refuse to go back to a place that treats their customers less than."}
{"text":"True good old fashioned southern hospitality in the middle of the city.

Was in Charlotte a recent evening and it was getting late for dinner.  I saw this place and since I love diners, especially mom & pop types, I thought I'd give it a chance.

The place was about 1/4 full with clientele from all walks of life.  The waitress/hostess quickly greeted and sat me.  

I ordered an evening special for about 7.99 that came with a meat, 2 sides, bread and soup; but was disappointed they were out of their complimentary soup.  The waitress did make it up to me and she provided cheerful and fast service.  I would definitely return next time I'm in the Queen City and definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The only place open on Christmas Eve, pretty awesome I say. My buddies and I just got finished watching Jumanji and decided to get something to eat. They have a pretty broad variety of choices to eat here."}
{"text":"continually filled coffee, huge portions, crispy hashbrowns, low prices.

I don't eat breakfast out as much as I used to, but every once in a while I have a pang of hunger for an omelet I don't have to make myself and lots of greasy carbness. Skyland serves it up right.

The three egg omelets are ridic, as are the portion of almost everything else. (they are also tasty) Speedy and friendly service, great specials (breakfast and daily), and a display case of desserts that is almost too tempting to just walk on by. 

love it!"}
{"text":"For a diner this place was great. Fast service and good food for the money. I ordered the chicken tips and with it had soup, fried okra, applesauce, corn bread, and Italian bread. Right now I am wishing I had one of these near my house open 24 hours!!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by for a little breakfast, and chose the 2 eggs, any style w/ one meat, and hash browns or grits, and biscuits or toast. Upon arriving there was no one at the door to seat me, and I should have known what the service was going to be, slow! As for the food, everything was just okay. The prices are a definite plus high."}
{"text":"I am a fan of diners.  Skyland is one of the many Greek-owned restaurants in town, but one of the very few (if any at all) that opens on Christmas Day.  It's a 24-hour spot mostly (I think it's closed Sunday late night through Monday morning).  I used to come here during the wee early morning hours after a night of partying like a rockstar.  Lately I've been here more for their dinner blue plates.  

The food here is typical home-cooking.  Fried livers have enough to be shared (don't ewww me!).  Cabbage rolls are good, but it's only on Fridays (or is it Saturdays?).  I personally don't care for their mac & cheese (it's dry and not too flavorful). Cabbage & oven potatoes are my favorites.  Fried apple sticks as a side can be consumed as a dessert :)  The best part of eating dinner here is the complimentary cup of soup.  I'm a soup addict.  The weirdest thing here is their YELLOW gravy, I swear it glows!  I was a bit taken back by it, but I needed gravy for my turkey & dressing last night, so I hope I am not turning any yellow-er today (lol, Asian joke).  And to be fair, the ladies that work here aren't rude all the time.  In fact mostly they're very southern diner nice.

I give them 4-stars because it's a reliable & affordable place to eat.  They don't care if you sit there all night (and I have, studying)."}
{"text":"Our first visit was Sat, 12-10-16 around 1:30pm.  Extensive menu. One had the special of the day, stuffed cabbage rolls, and the other, chicken fried steak with white gravy (both with 2 sides).  We started with a cup of the vegetable soup of the day.  Everything was very reasonably priced considering the large portions and the food was very good.  Servers were extremely nice and helpful.  The restaurant was clean. We saw folks eating breakfast, appetizers, burgers, or just salads and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, stopped in at 2 something in the morning and the place was packed.  Seated quickly, served quickly.  All food was top notch.  Gyros were awesome!  Fries and the Greek salad were also stupendous.  Will definitely be back ASAP."}
{"text":"For my first few years of college, Skyland was the go to place for eats after a night of drinking. Good food + pretty good prices + open all night = winning combination."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, Greek owners. Skyland's occupies a fairly large space, but feels very homey. Lots of regulars, not just once a week, but religiousy. 

Great daily specials, i.e. Eggs, toast, bacon/sausage and hash browns for $3.99 - Are you outta your mind!? 

Great sausage, great biscuits w/gravy. Did I mention hash browns are cooked to perfection, golden brown without even asking!? Nom nom nom!"}
