{"text":"I wanted to take my family to an authentic Canadian-French restaurant while visiting over the holidays. Every meal was cooked to perfection. Even the picky eating teenagers were impressed which is hard to do in fine restaurants. Our meats fell apart without any assistance from knives. The owner-hostess is beyond friendly and helped us with our limited understanding of the menu. Fantastic experience, Merci!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent.  Osso bocco is cooked for over 20 hours.  Lamb is tender and the sauce is superb.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This inconspicuous little restaurant proved to be a delightful surprise. It is a quaint 100 year old former school house with a mixture of cozy and elegant decor. Our hostess (wife of the chef) was charming, informative and thankfully English speaking! We sampled two of the amazing offerings on her menu, the sweetbreads and the slow cooked boneless beef. Both were outstanding. The sweetbreads were gently breaded and fried, served with a sliver of apple and ginger in a subtle sauce. The beef was the best you will ever taste, brown on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. The appetizers were imaginative and visually appealing. The Mediterranean cake had the most aromatic olive flavoring and the crab cake was moist, citrusy and divine. The desserts were heavenly as well, the panna cotta light and creamy and the chocolate mousse was decadent and intense. 
The authenticity of the French cuisine will be something we will remember forever."}
