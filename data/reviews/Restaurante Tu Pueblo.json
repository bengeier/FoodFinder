{"text":"Love this restaurant!!! We made this place our regular place every Friday night. Authentic Mexican food with amazing prices. There is beer and music and a wonderful atmosphere. It may look rundown from the outside but give it a chance. It's amazing."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Mexican food and I'm not talking no macayos ... Defiantly come check this place out ! Delicious food, hand made tortillas, a verity of foods to fit everyone's liking, fresh made salsas, definitely a family place and fairly prices! Very much recommended guaranteed to leave with a full stomach and full satisfaction!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to coming and having a nice quiet breakfast with family, this isn't the right place to come. The music is extremely loud you can't even hear yourself think. Also there was only one server serving the whole restaurant slow service. If I wasn't as hungry as I was I would've walked out"}
