{"text":"Consistently excellent pizza and wings.  The staff is friendly and service is speedy. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"best pizza not only in town but that we've ever had deliver to us. Open late and super friendly staff, so much so once when I had to run to work for an emergency after ordering, I stupidly forgot to leave my kids $20... the delivery guy (we're at a point now I should know his name but I'm terrible with names) let them have it and said we could pay another time because he knew us so well - as we only ever order pizza from them. 
I seriously recommend giving their pizza a try, I have many friends as does my son who've become regulars over the years after having a slice at my place."}
{"text":"Pizza is made with air bake oven, was Okay in a pinch. Wings were great! Good deal if your looking for cheap pizza made fast."}
