{"text":"I am new to North Las Vegas; just moved here from So Cal  where we LOVE our tacos. The truck was outside the Clark County Auction on Saturday. I had the carne asada tacos with everything and Verde sauce...OMG! I ate one in the car before I drove away and I was in heaven. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Plenty of it too, no skimping here. It brought joy to my world. I couldn't drive away until I got a photo of the truck so I could find them again. Luckily I got a card...I will find you again my friend :-)"}
{"text":"tried the food here a few days ago with my boyfriend. I got a quesadilla with meat , and he got a burrito. the quesadilla was about $6 and absolutely great! it was nice and stuffy with meat, and the meat itself had a great flavor. it had pico de gallo with avocado slices inside and beans. and he is not greedy at all. definitely worth the price. my boyfriend got a carnitas burrito and he was in love with it . stuffy burrito as well. great salsa options to mix in with the food as well. we will definitely come back. friendly owner btw!"}
{"text":"Best authentic tacos in town! It might be hidden in the hood a little but if you want something worth your dollar portions are huge. Quesadillas here are my favorite."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best tacos trucks out here! East Vegas off Charleston and 95 exit. It's a hidden gem! Tacos de asada on effen point, juicy and flavorful meat! The salsa has a nice kick! Don't recommend to gringos lol jk it's spicy though! Definitely coming again and again to get my taco fill!"}
{"text":"I love this taco truck! The quesidellas and tacos are so delicious and the owner is so friendly. The food is always fresh and the meat is seasoned perfectly ! His carne asada tacos are the best and defentliey not the traditional kind. If your looking for the best tacos or quesadillas in town this is the place to go !"}
{"text":"Holy smokes!!! Hands down BEST QUESADILLA EVER!!!! Had a quesadilla de carne asada, seriously, the tortilla was perfectly crispy, cheese was perfectly melted. Tacos were really fresh and tasty. Had tacos de carne asada and lengua, quality of flavors really stand out. Will definitely stop by again!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had the special. It was 3 tacos and a drink for 5 bucks. And they were good. Like, real good. So if you've lost all your money gambling and are hungry en route back to the airport, have your rideshare swing you by this place and get awesome, inexpensive tacos to drown your sorrows."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Cheap meals at a high quality of Mexican authenticity. One of the best Taco stands"}

{"text":"This is my 2nd time here.  Both times I had tacos and they are the best I've had in Las Vegas.  I love the style of the tacos and Jaime really hooks you up! The tacos are big, and they have the perfect amount of meat.   I order the tongue tacos and pastor and they were really good.  Besides the great food Jaime has the best costumer service.  Both times I have been there we talk like we have known each other for a while.  He is from Veracruz and doesn't like the hot weather here in Vegas ;). Go and enjoy the food, and get to know this awesome man :)"}
{"text":"The man had run out of two ingredients for that night but he was very nice and friendly. The food truck isn't there very often. And the quesadilla was good but not the best I've had. Will definitely be going back to try the tacos and give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Just simply some of the best tacos I have ever had. The meat is always seasoned perfectly and the tacos have so much that you are full after two. The price is spot on with how much you get. The owner is so nice and cooks everything fresh."}
{"text":"Needed some gas for my car and stopped at the 76 gas station & I  saw this little taco stand but its a bit hidden in the back of the gas station but the lights should catch your eye. My hubby and I decided to try this taco stand... Well let me say that these tacos are by far the best I've had in Vegas. The owner was very sweet and made us feel like family. The tacos are big and the meat is on point (totally worth $)"}
