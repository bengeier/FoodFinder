{"text":"This is a great sushi spot. They take care of their clients.. To be more specific my boyfriend is allergic to seafood and this is the only sushi spot we can trust! And their food is amazing :) 
Great service, a must try!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. I did not place an order on the phone, I just showed up and ordered. Service was awesome. I ordered the Panko crusted crab and shrimp/veggie tempura. I was in a rush so I just went with the Bento Box 30 (for 2). No complaints whatsoever it was very good. I hear their specialties are awesome will order that next time :-)."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this restaurant solely on the location and the English/French menu and was treated to some of the best Sushi I have ever had!  Will definitely make sure to stop by every time I'm back in Montreal."}

{"text":"The staff were super friendly, waitress gave us great recommendations and kept making sure everything was to our liking. The food was delicious! I seriously recommend going there for their sushi (the speciality rolls). I'd recommend this place to anyone and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wow! Great and delicious. 
The place is clean and nicely decorated, the prices are reasonable, the service is great, and the food is delicious! Their menu selection is original - having both typical rolls that you would see in other sushi places and their own creations.

I had the Kodi-mon, one of their specialty rolls. 6 pieces but the pieces are big.

My friends ordered bento boxes that came with soups. My order didn't come with one but the chef kindly gave me one too.

We then had dessert. I had the Baci cake which is a chocolate and hazelnut layer cake with white cream. It looked \"heavy\" but it tasted sweet and light.

Will go back!"}
