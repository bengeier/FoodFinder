{"text":"This place is an embarrassment of a business. It's such as shame that such a great location is going to waste. This past week my friend made a reservation for a going away party and when we arrived they did not have us \"in the book\" and acted clueless instead of resolving the issue in a professional manner. Then I came here for happy hour and searched for a hostess of waitress and could not find one so we sat ourselves on the patio. We waited 20 minutes before realizing no one was going to wait on us, even though an employee, wearing McFaddens shirt, was hanging out with his friends at a nearby table and clearly saw us waiting. Once we got up and went to the bar the waitress took our drink orders, claimed she'd be back for our food orders AND NEVER RETURNED. Even though she was standing right in front of us. Did I mention we were 2 of 8 people at the restaurant? We waited 15 minutes while her and the other server (who was wearing shorts where her buff cheeks were exposed) sat on their phones and hugged the same male employee who ignored us earlier. After finally waiting to the point of being annoyed we spoke up and ordered our food and returned to our outdoor table. Only for the server with the short shorts to come over and ask for our order again because the other waitress did not remember it. Our food finally arrived, no one asked us if we wanted water or any more drinks and they never checked on us again. When we were done we returned to the bar to check out and the waitresses were obviously intoxicated and dancing on the bar... at 7:30 on a Monday with 6 other people at the bar. The male worker then attempted to get us to tip well while checking out by apologizing for everything being \"crazy\" and offered us water... As we were walking out. This location is in an amazing spot and I used to think highly of this bar. Now it's just a disgusting excuse for a business with lazy employees. You're paying them to drink while customers basically serve themselves. It's no wonder there were so few people there. I will never return or recommend it to anyone. And to think I almost payed a $10 cover charge after a Pirates game makes me sick. $10 for your employees to get drunk and \"work\", no thanks."}
{"text":"This is not a sports bar as they can only show one game on ALL of their TVs.  And out of several beers. Real disappointing."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting friends and they brought me to this place after the baseball game. I am not a huge Steelers or Pirates fan but a great place to go to after/before games.  

Great Bar food!

Bartenders are nice and friendly. My buddys always said me SnapChats of this place on Sundays and it looks like it bumpin! 

Drink prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped after a Pirate game. Our waitress Amanda was nice, but the food was cold and just average. Ordered a drink and it was wrong. Unfortunately Not some place we would stop again."}
{"text":"Arrived at 4 on Saturday, but they were closed...website and sign on door say open at 11:00 am. Website says kitchen open at 3. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Went to a Pirate Game and this place looked to be going off on a Friday night so we strolled in afterward.  Good atmosphere lots of young people as it turned out a bus load from Morgantown West Virginia had came down to party.  All and all a decent scene, had fun and met alot of other people from out of town.  Everyone was pretty wasted and there was lots of dancing going on with all the college kids."}
{"text":"Went here for some food and a drink or two. The food was well below average and the drinks were pretty bad as well. I got a vodka and sprite. Basically got a watered down sprite.... I mean how do you mess up a vodka and sprite.  Some else with me got a margarita and said it tasted like margarita mix that's it. 
We didn't even finish our meals. Instead we left and went to the supermarket and got some food to take back to the hotel room. I feel bad to say it was simply horrible."}
{"text":"Food was great and the view was beautiful..service was very slow but the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Dont be fooled by the website!!! This place is awfullllll. We had a reservation they didnt know who we were. We waited 45 in for a table and they were dead. We talked to 3 ppl everyone here is a dumba$$ omg so embarrassing.  The worst excuse for a business ive ever been too. Dont waste your time go to Cleveland! ! A better city with may more attractive people and a better culinary scene. #dropthemic"}
{"text":"If there were negative stars I'd have to use them for the lunch service.

I work next door and our internal cafe shut down forcing us to find food in the neighborhood.  There's seldom more than 10 customers in the huge pub at lunch.  With that many customers you'd think that they could serve up a salad pretty quick wouldn't you?  Well don't get your hopes up.

For a salad that is a decent size you have to wait long enough that the cook could have harvested the contents from a victory garden, in the next county!  

The wait staff is perfect for something like a bachelor's party but if that's what you're looking for you might as well go to Hooters.  The foods faster and the atmosphere isn't trying to be something it's not.  

As an Irish Pub the only thing they've gotten right is the name.  The food's not Irish, The Guiness is flat and the Bar keep looks at you funny if you ask for a Black and Tan.  Since when did a \"Blue Moon\" become a staple at an Irish Pub?

The people are friendly though, I hope they get better management so they can become a true Irish Pub.  You can never have enough of them."}
{"text":"GREAT location right next to PNC Park, easy to get to with the T for free from downtown. I've only had the buffalo chicken salad to eat, and it was delicious! Other than that, the bartenders make strong drinks, definitely worth the money, and they have girls always coming around with $3 shots. 

Would definitely recommend if you want to drink for cheap before a game!"}
{"text":"We have been on a week long road trip, and this was by far the worst stop on the trip. We waited 8 minutes before being greeted by the server, and when I asked to talk to a manager i was told the server was new, but she would get him. Then when talking to the manager his response was, I dont know who has what section...I said that didnt matter and waiting 8 minutes was very unacceptable. especially when a table that was sat 5 minutes after us was greeted immediately, and got their drinks before we were even greeted. Very unprofessional, and they clearly dont care about their customers.  50 dollars was way to much to eat here, and we should have left after waiting 8 minutes to be greeted....save your time and money, and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Came in at 2 on a Sunday. The pulled pork sandwich was good, as were the tator torts. Amanda liked the chicken sandwich:) Jay liked the ruban. service was good. Had food in less than a half hour."}
{"text":"Bartender w short hair told me shots were $3 when we first arrived. Fucking bitch. We drank 3 shots each and it cost us almost $100 and then said it was $11 each. I'm visiting Pittsburgh and will never EVER be back to this shit hole. thought this place was cool until she betrayed us."}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced, so friend had VIP half off drinks (making them normal prices) we were 1 min after 12 & had to pay the 5 to get in like you make bank but can't let the one minute ppl slide. Anyway beers are 5 & up. Ppl in here spending there damn pet food money n shit. Bar tenders are cool some are bitches but ay who ain't sometimes. For the most part unless you come for happy hour or don't have shit to pay for in your life skip this bitch"}
{"text":"Not to bad, but not the kind of place I would go out of my way to visit.  Our waitress was pleasant and accommodating but the food was neutral (but not bad)."}
{"text":"I've only been a few times, but last night was the worst experience. My food was awful, our waitress was very slow, the drinks were not worth the money I paid for. When we moved over to the bar area, the bartenders spent more time talking to each other than waiting on customers. Probably will never go back, unless I am dragged there!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of gals for a ..... girls night out on a Monday! Right by the water which was amazing! Friendly bartender and great cooks! Ordered beers and appetizers. Hmm. Let's see if I can remember correctly what's the menu?! Smoke fried chicken wings? It was yummy! Habanero chicken was freaking to die for!!! And the sampler. I didn't get to try the sampler because I had a party of hungry gals that ate it up but said it was yummy. Huge place!"}
{"text":"If you can't get tickets to a Steeler home game this is the best spot to watch the game. Live dj spinning Steeler favorites. Drinks reasonably price just a great atmosphere to watch the game. Word of advice if it's a playoff game get there early to avoid long lines and a $10 or $20 cover charge. The food is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We went to McFadden's on a semi busy summer Sunday (not football season).  We (4 people) were seated and not greeted for 10+ minutes.  When we were greeted (because we flagged a waitress down who had walked by us at least a dozen times) we asked, \"are you are server?\"  her response was \"Yah.\".  Nothing else but silence..Awkward. So we ordered our beers which took at least 8-10 minutes to receive.  We knew we were in trouble on time, so we immediately placed our order when she returned. Easy as pie:  4 side salads all ranch and two order of 'boneless wings'.   1 HOUR LATER: \"Oh your food is in the window and don't worry my managers taking care of it\"  then 10 more minutes roll by..we order more beers but they never show.  Finally our food arrived.  Salad was sub par at best,  but the wings ($11 an order) were chicken fingers, NOT wings and tasted worse than ANYtizers you buy in the frozen food section.  Worst, worst, WORST.  We got our checks and realized she put $8 beers on our tabs that no one had ordered.  We didn't have time to care at that point since our dinner and check process took over an hour and 45 minutes so we just paid and left.  P.S. don't plan on having a conversation because they blast music to the point where their speaker system is crackling.  I would never recommend this place.  Figure it out, McFadden's."}
{"text":"Hott staff, cheap drink specials, and great bar food. A Must-do before any Pittsburgh sporting event!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever gotten. Barely any alcohol in any of my friends or my drinks. And, worst of all, an ex-bartender who worked there tried to hit on my friends and I. When we rejected him, he dropped his drink by accident then laughed, dropped ours, then told the \"security\" or guy workers that it was our fault and got us all kicked out! The one man grabbed my neck and led me outside, forcing me to stand in 24 degree weather while I waited for my friends. I pleaded to at least stay in the vestibule and he refused. Unbelievable, disrespectful and unnecessarily cruel. They treat women like shit, pleading for them to dance on bars because \"our parents won't find out\". Trust me, my mom is all about me being sexy, but not me being taken advantage of by power hungry, domineering men. Gross! Dont go there. There are no hot men to hit on anyway."}
{"text":"Mcfaddens is definitely the go-to bar in the North Shore - especially on game days or Friday/Saturday nights. There's always a pretty big crowd, but they have 3 huge bars and a patio so it's easy to get a drink. The staff is also really fun and friendly... especially when they dance on the bar with you. We had an issue with another customer once and the  security was immediately on it and the managers were quick to check if the situation was handled. I would definitely recommend this bar to anyone from Pittsburgh or from out of town visiting and going to Pirates/Steelers games. The experience is all worth it and it's a much better atmosphere than going to the Southside or Shadyside every weekend. Good food, good staff, and good music. Plus it's right next to the river, PNC Park and Heinz Field."}
{"text":"I ate at this establishment for the first time last night and had one of the worst meals in recent memory.  I had mahi mahi, which was described as teriyaki style, but was served drenched in overpowering AllBay seasoning with teriyaki sauce. Hard to believe anyone actually thought those flavors intentionally belonged together. It was awful. My dining companion had the smoked turkey/pulled pork, which was fine but both of us were served a pile of bland overcooked 100% brocolli (and maybe cauliflower) stems as the veggie...not a single crown, along with a scoop of horribly oversalted mashed potatoes.  I realize it is a pub, not a fine restaurant, but this was truly memorable for how bad it was.  PS I also sent them feedback via their website and they didn't even bother to respond. Given their built in sports crowd it would seem they couldn't care less about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the Winter classic because tickets were absurd.  Located right next to Heins field, this place rocks.  Dude man that runs the joint is friendly, and the bartenders are fun as hell.  They know how to party.  Certainly a great venue during all Pittsburgh sporting events. Prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"This place is so gross. I was here Saturday night, it was pretty busy. It was impossible to get a drink and I'm not a hater by any means by it's really annoying that you let workers and whoever they want dance on the bar. People were basically trying to get around the people on the bar to get to the bartender to get a drink. The floor at this bar was DISGUSTING!!!!! I couldn't even walk on it. Like you had to really peel your feet off the bottom of it to move. My group and I joked that you kind of have to shuffle to move. So I am thinking of those people's feet being on that floor and then walking all over the bar where people are trying to get served and touching. It was just gross. 
      It's a shame because this bar is a great location, but not clean and doesn't look like any money is being put into it. I will say the DJ played good music however. But really, this place needs some good TLC and maybe get the people off the bars and build them a little dance stage area."}
{"text":"Drinks are expensive and parking is tough.  $5.00 for a Miller Light bottle even during happy hour!? or maybe happy hour isn't available every night?  That seems a bit high to me.  It expect to pay that much for Corona maybe.  I recommend arriving early because of the parking. Many of the parking lots are \"lease only\".  Sure parking is available but it might be a little walk."}
{"text":"I was here for a company function in the back of the restaurant/bar and everything was great until I moved to the main bar. I was ordering a water (for the DD) and a cocktail and when I asked for the water first, the bartender (male) cut me of and sent over another bartender. As I'm ordering to the second bartender (also male), he crumples up a wet napkin and throws it in my face. I was so taken aback and offended. Obviously, I decided to take my business elsewhere.

Giving 2 stars because the two female bartenders in the back were wonderful."}
{"text":"look - this is a kinda divey bar right next to PNC park. loud music indoors. no idea of the food, but the drink poors are decent gievn the prices. We loved the outdoor area and acoustic guitar player."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise in our trip to Pittsburgh. We were in town for my buddy's bachelor party and after the game we decided to stop in here since it was right next to the stadium.

We got there about 9pm on a Saturday and it was very casual and not very busy.. yet. We were hanging out drinking watching some sports on TV and slowly but steadily the place starts filling up, the lights go down and a pretty good DJ starts spinning. Within an hour the place was packed with people dancing everywhere and having a good time. There were people packing the dance floor and others dancing on top of the bar. At one point the staff was on top of the bar pouring shots into people's mouths. I did not complain. I heard they started charging a cover after we got there. Also noticed there were one or two bachelorette parties being celebrated at the same time.

The bartender was also very helpful. As we were drinking we told her about the bachelor party and she got the manager to approve giving us wristbands which allowed us to drink for half off while the bachelor was free! What a great gesture for us and our wallets.

This place really turned the party into a blast."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Pittsburgh bar before a game.  A 30 minute wait for food and after the food order the waitress did not return for nearly 40 minutes and never brought additional drinks."}
{"text":"Terrible service, average food.

I understand how service would be slow before a pirate game, but since their right next to the ballpark you might think they would plan for it.  The place was not even half full, and it took forever to get served.  It takes time to cook dinners of course, but it took 20 minutes to get a coke, then it came in a little dixie cup.  The waiter had to be reminded 4 times before he remembered to get a drink for one girl at our table.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for a few drinks with friends or to watch a sports event. Large bar with tvs in every direction and a great DJ that plays music for a younger crowd. My friends and I had a blast here our first time!!"}
{"text":"Pregame Pirates. I'm sitting at the bar. 6 bartenders. Not that busy.  10 minutes to get acknowledged. Whoever owns this or manages this, get a clue. You're happy with the biz pregame because of your location? You could double it if your employees spent more time waiting on customers than talking to each other. Really bad.  Too many choices. First and last time for me."}
{"text":"The food was so bad I couldn't eat much of my meal. Had a grilled spicy chicken sandwich that was tough and dry, not to mention it wasn't spicy and I couldn't even taste the sauce. Sauce of any kind would've been welcome for even a hint of moisture.

Another off-putting aspect: the diet coke was un-drinkable. I'm not sure how they managed to have their soda taste not only flat but totally stale, but they did. Once again, two sips then I was done. Had a Sam Adams Octoberfest on draft which at least I could drink, but you can taste that they never clean their tap lines. 

Disgusting place overall. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible...toss up of what was worse....the food or the service. Went tonight before Pirate Game with group of friends and to celebrate a birthday. Waitress took an exceptionally long time to even acknowledge me. Ordered 2 Cokes...Cheese Wedges and a Turkey Bacon Sub. Was told the sandwiches were made up ahead of time and no options could be ordered. The drinks were delayed...I had to ask for them again. Sandwich and Cheese Wedges came out...you could tell the sandwich wasn't made fresh and I didn't see any Bacon on my sandwich. I had to ask 2 times for a napkin and silverware. The tables felt like beer had been spilled and never cleaned. Sticky like pancake syrup. Overall for $30.... Awful food...lousy, non existent service and watered down soda. I expected a lot more from a downtown, stadium district bar. NEVER WILL I GO THERE AGAIN. 
TIP: Eat dinner BEFORE going to the game somewhere besides McFaddens"}
{"text":"Thursday night is 5 wings for $2 dollars and domestics beers for $2. The food quality is standard bar food. Can't beat 10 wings and 2 beers for $8."}
{"text":"I came here to watch the CAPs game. While there, I ordered 10 wings (McFaddens Glazed and Maple Hot). Maple Hot was amazing.  The sweetness balanced out the spiciness. Well done. 

The dining area had a lot of little nets flying around. The table and chairs were sticky. The place felt dirty.  Only three stars."}
{"text":"I had tickets to a Pirates game and was looking for a place near PNC Park where I could get a drink and a quick meal. 

Most of the places in the area were super packed with no chance of me getting a seat or any service. McFaddens was an exception. They have a huge bar area and where were plenty of seats and places to stand right at the bar and order a drink and meal. 

Apart from the convenience of being the only place close to the park where I could get service, I found the place to be just average. I had a couple of Yuengling drafts and a chicken sandwich. The beer selection is OK, but not too extensive. The chicken sandwich was also just OK. It was a buffalo chicken sandwich. I've had similar sandwiches at many places and the one here was a little smaller than most I've had. 

One positive item was the service. The ladies behind the bar were really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The drinks are cheap.  That's the nicest thing I have to say.  It's a bro bar right by the stadiums, so standards can't really be too high.  The food is awful, the service is really bad, the drinks are domestic...but It is what it is."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes fr a seat and waited another 45 mins for food. Tried to pay for drinks and cancel food. Was told we weren't allowed. Customer service was horrible. Waiter told us we were next and 20mins later after we said we wanted to pay for drinks that we weren't next but after that. Waiter barely stopped by the table to see how we were doing.  Never again."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. DO NOT COME HERE. Slow service, bad waitress, mediocre food. So mad that I came here."}
{"text":"To say I don't remember a goddamn thing about this place would be a semi-true statement.  Went on a Saturday night before the casino with some of my friends and we are all in medical school so it was an eclectic bunch.  Greek, Colombian, Ethiopian, Indian.  It was like the United Nations descended on yinzburgh.  I grew up in California and have never felt so distinctly Chinese in my life.  Lubed ourselves up with alcohol, started browning out somewhere near 11pm, told a girl I had escaped from North Korea and taught myself perfect English while in the labor camps.  Sorry, if you're reading this.  I grew up in Fremont CA and I feel terrible, but not because I went to McFaddens"}
{"text":"Dead empty on a Thursday during happy hour before the Steelers game.  Just a couple guys playing video games.  Sign outside mentions $1 miller lites on Thursdays.  Except we found out that wasn't until 9pm.  And happy hour didn't start until 5:30 so until then Miller Lites were $6.  The bar looked nice inside but the bartender couldn't be bothered.  No thanks, 1 miller lite and left."}
{"text":"2 bartenders on after the baseball game and one server watching the wings game on the tv the whole night,   took us 20 mins to get a drink and then when i ordered 5 shot of washington apples  i was charged 42$ for 5 of them!! really?  seems high,  and she poured the extra shot in a cup for a friend 4 seats down from me!     i asked the server how much those shots are  she said 7 $ each    so 7 times 5  is $35  not $42  i ask the manager about it,,   he told me he would check it out and she probably hit the button on the screen one time extra by accident  but she was never over by the computer the whole time i ordered drinks or paid!!  umm so she never rang it up while i was standing there!   the manager never came back to me, he avoided me the rest of the time over 30 mins   so we got up and left!    never be back AGAIN!!   bartender and the manager dont care! just after youre cash   stealing from the bar!"}
{"text":"I was heading into PNC Park when I first noticed McFadden's near the gate. My guest and I decided to stop in for a few quick drinks since it was absolutely freezing out. 

Upon walking in, the first thing that caught my eye was the sports memorabilia on the walls and the size of the place. I was very content with the pub/sports bar feel.

The staff were extremely friendly and skilled at making the drinks we requested, and were very helpful in making drink suggestions. 

I really would suggest this place for anyone attending a sporting event in the North Shore, as it's a great place to start your drinking excursion."}
{"text":"Let me be clear, 4 stars is for CRYSTAL, not mcfaddens as a whole. If you stop in and Crystal isn't working walk your ass right out that door because there is no reason for you to be in that place. 
This bar lives off of baseball/ football games and maybe a crowd if there's a concert going on at AE. That is all they are there for. They usually have game day specials like 4 bottles of IC for $12, which isn't bad considering that the are so close to both ball fields, but don't expect much more. Food takes minimum 30 min to get out, so cross that right off your list if you're in a rush. If you do have time hey, the food isn't too shabby. 
Every bartender prrrobably shouldn't be a bartender, but then the beer gods throw you Crystal. She is this tiny dark haired girl who knows her shit! She remembered everyones drink order in my sight when they wanted a new drink she was on top of it and wasn't a bitch about it. Crystal we don't know why you stay at mcfaddens but hats off to you, you're the bomb.com"}
{"text":"This place tries to take advantage of you if you start a tab. DO NOT start a tab here. My bill was $24 for 1 gin and tonic."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before the Steelers game last night. Overall, nothing special, nothing terrible. The floor was unusually sticky everywhere. They had a nice patio area, and the whole place is very wide open. Next time I go to Pittsburgh I'll take my chances elsewhere. Again, nothing was terrible, but there wasn't anything special about the place, or anything that gives you a reason to want to comeback."}
{"text":"Good-sized spot & close to the ballpark. Both pluses. Decent amount of taps. Food was pretty good-they have good portion sizes.

We had a good time when there, but it was never very busy and seems like people must not like to hit it up after games."}
{"text":"The service is HORRIBLE and drinks are over priced. Went here for a bachelorette party we each had one drink because we had to wait so long for service. With the bachelorette package you get a free bottle of Smirnoff, the bachelorette had one drink of it then it was taken from our table. Also, the bartenders were extremely rude."}
{"text":"Never came during the day, but came several nights in college 6-7 years ago now... loved the \"all-you-can-drink\" happy hour specials,  but really that's all. For being 21 or 22, that was a great deal. 

They still call me maybe once a year saying I won a happy hour,  except I don't live out there anymore, so I can't use it."}
{"text":"An okay bar next to the stadiums in Pittsburgh.  They have a decent selection of beer and while the special beer is decently priced the normal beer (Coors, Miller, Bud, etc.) is not, it is quite expensive for Pittsburgh.

When there is not a home game the place can be pretty empty but when there is a home game it is packed with people and can be pretty fun.  There is also a relatively large outside area with views on Downtown and the river.

I would go here only if there was something going on on the North Shore, otherwise, there are much better bars/restaurants to go to in Pittsburgh than here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is super fun! The bar is nicely-sized, though can still get packed on weekends. The drink prices are about what you'd expect ($3-$4 for a beer), but they often have specials.

The bartenders are usually cute and fun (dancing on bars is common) and the DJ really pump up the music as the night goes on."}
{"text":"Why do people still come here? The place is huge but they can't staff the bar with enough people for the crowd. Open the 3rd bar or beef up the bar staff to accommodate the people. It should never take 30 minutes to get a drink... not only that, but it's so loud the bartenders can't even hear what you're trying to order and the 1/2 off drink special is a hoax won't be going back. 
UPDATE: I called and talked to a manager. I was charged for 2 additional \"top shelf\" drinks that I never ordered. The manager was to call me back, but I haven't heard a thing."}
{"text":"I came here about a week ago and loved it! It was definitely a crowd of people ages 21-35 on a Saturday night. They had a DJ who was playing top 40 music, and the bartenders were super nice. This is definitely more of a sports bar scene in comparison to tequila cowboy down the street. Drinks are also way better priced here than at Tequila Cowboy. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 3 stars. Not for food. Not for cleanliness but for the bartender. We ordered a salad and turkey hoagie with tots.  The salad was clearly a bagged salad that I typically get at Giant Eagle for lunch that costs $2.00 a bag. They hooked us when they said the turkey is smoked in house. Turkey was average and the bread tasted very average - the tots were just...eh....tots. Wine (2), beer (3), a shot and food=$69."}
{"text":"Wish I'd read some previous reviews before I went here. If there isn't an event in the area go someplace else. Food was OK. If you want dinner in an empty warehouse this is the place to go. Service was OK but not great."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this bar. I booked an event over two months in advance, bringing over 20 guests in my party. I had all reservations booked for a full night of festivities for the bride to be. I also arranged the plans for our out of town guests attending. Because this event was scheduled on a night of a Pittsburgh home game, McFadden's called a week before the party and CANCELED without being able to do anything about it. This was clearly handle unprofessional and a horrible way to make a business. I am very upset and will never be back to that bar again."}
{"text":"Was there last Saturday afternoon. Not many people in the bar. Music was way too loud (or am I just getting old?). Disappointed that the only healthy option on the menu (an appetizer of chopped veggies and low fat ranch) weren't really served with low fat ranch. And the steamed veggies with my meal were loaded with butter, although the prep notes only mention \"steamed\" to make me think it's a \"good for you\" choice."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday around 6:30pm before a concert at StageAE. Honestly the main reason we ended up at McFaddens was because all of the other places closer to the venue had 90+ minute waits to be seated. The place was basically empty. The bar seating was pretty full but other than that, only 3-4 tables were occupied in the whole place. 

It took about 10 minutes for someone to come over and take a drink order. 10 minutes later the waitress comes with 1 beer, and tells me they are refilling the keg of the Sam Adams summer ale that I ordered. Okay, fine. Another 10 minutes and she comes by and says they're actually out of the summer ale, so I ordered a Summer shandy. 

We were waiting for another couple to join us, and by the time they got there, my boyfriend was just about finished with his beer while I still hadn't even received mine. The waitress promptly came over to take their drink orders (they got the special which was $4 bud light bottles.. Not much of a special really) and asked me if I wanted the special too. Pretty sure she totally forgot about my summer shady. 

Took about 10-15 minutes for her to come back with the rest of our drinks. We figured we better order while she was there. 

We ordered chicken sandwiches and wraps. The food was fine, nothing to rave about (other than the fact that I ordered grilled and she gave me fried chicken). I'm not sure if our waitress was horrible or if the place was understaffed. It did look like she was switching between hostess, bartender and waitress. 

Overall, great place to watch a game. Great location. Food is just average, as well as the prices. Service was poor from my one experience."}
{"text":"The sound level wasn't too loud, and the service at the bar was fairly prompt and friendly (although one female bartender insisted on cracking her gum very loudly and frequently which I found unprofessional and rude).  Unfortunately, the food was absolutely terrible.  The crab dip tasted like lighter fluid and the bread that came with it was bland and dry. The total bill for one appetizer and two beers came to an outrageous $27 before tip. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"If possible I would give this place 0 out of 5 stars. It was well operated in the early 2010's. Now it has gone completely down hill.

The prices of drinks are outrageous and the food quality is sub par.

Avoid this place at all costs. The good news is there are 4 quality bars & restaurants next door."}
{"text":"Awful would be a compliment. Terrible service explains a huge empty bar beside a baseball stadium before a game."}
{"text":"It was just OK.Never thought I'd say this but the place seemed to be TOO big for the amount of people. My highlight of the Pittsburge trip was seeing the bride to be of a bachellorette party fall off the bar while dancing. LMAOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is new since I last lived in Pittsburgh - it's huge!  But totally one of those big, canned, Irish bars.  It was relatively empty this snowy Friday afternoon - and service was slow.  There were a couple special requests, nothing outlandish, that they just couldn't get right.

They do have a \"build a hoagie/salad\" checklist, which was ok.  For a Catholic during lent, it was hard to find anything without meat - or without fries or cheese, for those watching their figures.  I got a sub with portobello, roasted reds, onions, oil & vinegar.  It was dry and the mushrooms were salty.

The chips however, were amazing!  Homemade with a hint of BBQ.  I'm not a big fan of chips, but for some reason, I couldn't stop eating them!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awful.  We only went here because the friends we were meeting made the choice.

First, it is insanely loud.  Like hurting your ear drums loud.  There was absoutely no reason for it.  It isn't a dance club at 5:30 in the afternoon. You are trying to eat a meal and have to shout to actually talk to your dining companions.  They were clearly targeting men with the way the servers were all dressed.  Two of them were actually showing butt cheek.  Our server was very attentive until she noticed that the three guys with us all had wedding rings on.  Then she was basically MIA for most of the evening.  We saw the shot girls and miller light girls more than we saw our server.

Food was mediocre at best.  I didn't expect anything outstanding, but it was clear most of the items were purely frozen items that were reheated.  We waited quite a bit (but they were busy) but two people's orders were cold. It was pretty obvious it had been out for a while and the server didn't pick it up for whatever reason.

Perhaps the most egregious thing was the prices.  I get it is a bar near the stadiums, so the entree prices were high but not unacceptable.  However, I asked for extra celery and was told there would be a $3 charge.  Three dollars for four pieces of celery?!  Extra blue cheese was also insanely over priced.  Most places will give you celery for free or maybe charge fifty cents.  But three dollars?!  And when I questioned the price the server said \"does that mean you don't want it?  It's not that expensive\"

If you are a 21-25 year old single male, maybe you would enjoy this place.  Otherwise, stay away."}
{"text":"I had to plan a bachelor party in Pittsburgh without ever having actually been there, and McFaddens saved my butt.

We wanted to find a bar that would allow us somewhat of a 'private event' for a few hours on Saturday afternoon, and McFaddens was the perfect choice.  The staff was super helpful both during the planning stages and during the actual event.  The prices were very reasonable and the food and drinks were exactly what we asked for.

The crowd was barely picking up by the time we left, but we interacted with some of the locals and it seemed like a cool place to hang out.  I don't know what midnight on a Friday is like, but if you're planning a small gathering and want you and your guests taken care of in impeccable fashion, I'd highly recommend McFaddens."}
{"text":"Tried to wait for my sister to retrieve her scarf. Security pushed me out the door after I said I would wait. We are not from the area so I didn't want to get separated. $10 cover ad well. Better options in Pittsburgh if you're looking to have a good time w/o an over assertive staff...."}
{"text":"Caught a Bucco game here recently, tried the Kilmore Quay Crab Dip ($9), which the bartender complimented as, \"the favorite menu item.\" Nothing else really looked appetizing, but I wasn't exactly hangry. It was indeed a delicious snack! I had about 3 mixed drinks & they were okay. The bill was more than it should have been. I could have walked across the street & enjoyed the Bucco game live AND had 3 drinks at the ballpark (ain't cheap!) for the same price. 

I've had a dinner here before as well, & it wasn't a meal to brag about or re-do.

All in all, it's a bar, next to PNC Park, with a lot of flatscreen tvs. So if you want to catch a game, with drinks, go for it. Just eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the worst bartenders in the burgh. Do you not want my money, instead just bs and stand around in groups and talk."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Bad food, staff had a horrible attitude and mixed drinks that you can drink all night and never get drunk. That works out well for a place with higher prices! No doubt they are making money due to the amount they charge for a mixed drink vs the amount of alcohol they put in them. 

If this bar wasn't next to the stadiums it wouldn't exists. Skip it and head somewhere else, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Fun place to meet friends. The food was delicious, and the service/bar staff were on point.  Always our go-to spot before any Steelers/Pirates game, or even to stop and get a drink and bite to eat before a concert at Stage AE.  Plenty of seating both at the bar and dinner tables.  The crowd always has energy and the staff shows everyone a good time.  Definitely the best spot for fun on the north shore."}
{"text":"Let's pause for a moment and be thankful for Groupon. 

Okay. For $13 you get $30 of food, or beer, according to our bartender. Great! Any time I can save some money, it's a good day. 

I ordered the potato pancakes, and the McFaddy MacDaddy. Josh got the 24/7 burger. 

So, it is positively obvious that they have one cook, with access to a microwave and a deep fryer. Everything flew out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes. 

The pancakes were misleading in the menu, making it seem like they were going to be somewhat homemade, or an amazing version that you wouldn't be able to tell that a big truck brought in a month ago. I digress. They were sad little pucks. But, salted and served with creole seasoning mixed with sour cream, they kind of redeemed themselves. 

Burgers. I love burgers. But these only came over cooked, and mine, with mac and cheese was just plain pasta with a slice of cheese plopped on top of it. The bacon was off the hook, though. 
Josh's burger was all kind of heart disease friendly. Egg, bacon, meat, and syrup. He liked it. But he likes everything. 

Service is amazing. They paid attention to us all evening, even though we weren't boozing like the rest of the crowd. So, it's probably a better place to drink, than eat. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I went here to watch some college football on a random Saturday afternoon. This place is exactly what I would expect for a pub on the North Shore right next to PNC Park. The food was typical bar fare priced at a premium. The drinks were nothing noteworthy and also on the pricey side. And the poor waitresses were all dressed in a rather scantily-clad manner, despite the fact that it was like 45 degrees outside that day and they had the doors open (it was so drafty in there that I had to wear my jacket). They do have a lot of TVs, so if your expectations are tempered for food and drink, it's not a bad place to catch a game. We opted to sit at a booth instead of the bar so we had a server. She was attentive and sweet, so that is the one bright spot in an otherwise forgettable experience."}
{"text":"Spacious bar for groups
Dance on the bar, or just watch
Easy to blackout"}
{"text":"I would give my experience here a one star, but the hostess, bartenders, and the wait to sit wasn't bad for a game night. Now given the fact that this establishment was extremely busy and is right next to PNC park, I understand the hectic work environment and amount of patience you must have to endure working in that. So here is my review.
   We arrived at a reasonable time to be able to get a table, around 430-5 on a game night. We put our name in, which works of a text message system, and then sat at the bar for a few beers. The place was extremely crowded, but only took a couple minutes to get our drinks. We only had to wait for 30 minutes and then were sat. 
     Now, even though there was plenty of space to spread the tables out, we were still squeezed between other tables. About 4 other table groups and we were all squashed like sardines. They seemed to have an excuse for EVERYTHING. But anyway. It took a good 5-6 minutes to get the server. We ordered the fried pickle backs, a garden salad with ranch, and the st pattys melt. The fried pickles were more like a fried pickle chopped into small pieces, mind you this was $9!! They were not very good, the sauce it came with was though. I would NOT recommend ordering this.I did inquire about the small portion to the food runner and he said it was because the owner wants them cut like that. Ooook. The salad was huge and the dressing was thick. The sandwich was alright too, but the bead was a little hard or crispy.
   The attention we received from the server was very minimal. Once we received our check we did not see our server again. They were setting up for an event where we were seated, so it was a little uncomfortable. Feeling of being rushed and the glares the remaining tables were getting. Another server ended up having to check us out. The bottom of the receipt was hilarious to me, also a little infuriating. Another table laughed as they read it too.
   Basically, if your going to come here on a game day, just order drinks from the bar."}
{"text":"I had a great first experience here- the service was quick and friendly, food and drinks were good as well!  
Unfortunately, I came back again with a slightly larger group, and they said that we would be charged extra for having a party of 8 or more and that the bill would not be able to be split......There was literally no one else in the entire restaurant.  We expressed that we didn't have cash so we wouldn't be able to split the bill.  Needless to say they let us walk out and lost 9 customers. For the record our waiter was very nice. It was the manager enforcing the policy."}
{"text":"Best servers and bartenders on the street. Erica and Tyler were awesome! Even the bathroom attendant was great! Will come back again for the service not to mention the great food!!! Went bar hoping to 5 bars hands down the best!!!"}
{"text":"Nice big sports bar, great for watching the game, or hanging out with friends after.  Service was fast & friendly.  Great happy hour specials, and hours, starts at 7pm.  $2 cheeseburgers or $5 wings (6).  The cheeseburger was delicious, tasted like a real fresh burger you would make at home, not your typical restaurant, frozen/low quality beef.  Definitely recommend getting a burger!  The appetizer sampler was a unique selection, your choice of wing flavor, fried provolone triangles, battered onion rings, & battered dill pickle spears.  The wings weren't crispy, & the battered items weren't fried long enough, too light in color and when you bite into them, still doughy.  The fried provolone was amazing and a refreshing difference from typical mozzarella."}
{"text":"Wish I had read some of these reviews before I actually went there. Whatever the system is that they try to use to run this place, it doesn't work. The food was fine, once it came and was correct. The service was mostly bad-but was done with a smile. We went before a Pirates game on a Tuesday evening, expecting a crowd but it really wasn't overly crowded. The young lady seating us went out of her way to get us a table. That was about the end of the good service, unfortunately. We waited for 10 minutes before our presence was even acknowledged by our \"waitress\", when she said she would be right back. Another 5 minutes or so go by and she finally comes back to take our orders. It took 10 more minutes just to get our drinks.  Our appetizer never came, and one (out of two) orders was not right when the food did get served...35 minutes later. It was hot and pretty good. But sorry, a fried fish sandwich and a burger shouldn't take 35 minutes. Add on to that the fact that another drink was ordered, which also never came. And BTW-the drinks were just coke."}
{"text":"This bar is good for 1 thing and that's getting drinks before a pirate game or after a Steelers win...that's it! I've never eaten here but this surely isn't a place I'd ever pick to eat at when there are plenty of better options near by. Another thing that sucks is they charge a cover when it's busy. I've been in line and have seen it go from $5-$15 as the line got longer! I guess the two nice things are...it's huge, lots of space to move around and they have an outside area. Honestly there's not much else to say. Typical sports bar, nothing special but I'll continue to visit when going to games."}
{"text":"This is THE place to be before a sporting event in Pittsburgh!!!!!!  We came on a game day to see the Steelers.  Most of the places in the area were super packed with no chance of getting a seat or service.  We just wanted a place with room to move that we could hang out at before the game.  We found our spot at Mcfadden's!  It is literally steps away from PNC park and very close to Heinz field. They have a huge bar area with TV's everywhere you look and TONS of space to hang out or grab a seat.  They even had a real-life DJ playing music----WHAT?!?!  How fun is that!!!  The music was loud but the selections were one's you couldn't help but smile and sing along with.  The game day crowd didn't stop us from quickly being served at a table near the bar.  The tap selections were impressive and we loved the mix of Irish and American mash-up items on the menu.  We decided to share the Reuben dip, Randy's Rueben, and mango habanero wings.  They did not disappoint!  Possibly one of the best Rueben's we have ever had, although still up for debate between my husband and I.  The service was excellent and the server had some great recommendations for things to see next time we visit Pittsburgh.  For being so busy on a game day, everything was exceptional. We were having so much fun that it was hard to leave for the game.  When it comes to pregaming in Pittsburgh, we have finally found our forever home in Mcfadden's!"}
{"text":"Best music, great staff, staple in the North Shore for Baseball/football games ! All around fun atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Came here before a Pirates game for dinner. I got the pulled pork sandwich with a side of tots and couldn't have been happier. They have reasonable prices and the food is great. The atmosphere is nice, plenty of TV's, very spacious and they have an outdoor area! We actually came back here after the game as well and it was like a whole different place at night. They had a great DJ who played a lot of older songs from the 90's and early 2000's, it was fun to hear something different for a change.They even play the music videos on a few of the TV screens which was really cool. They have an attendant in the bathroom and she was really sweet and helpful but the line can get a bit long.

Overall I had a great time, nice place, good food, drinks are reasonable and the service was great. Definitely recommend and will be back. (I want to test their Sunday brunch)"}
{"text":"me and my wife ate there for lunch. plenty of flat screens and seating. we ordered the fish sandwich and cheesesteak sandwich. both were very good and the portions were right for the price. we walked out of there 30 bucks lighter and that included a healthy tip.  they re closed on sundays which is odd for a sports bar a half a block from heinz field. but overall good experience and hope to visit again soon."}
{"text":"McFadden's was the one place near Stage AE that we'd put off going to, but in all sobriety, I had a commendable pre-concert meal here recently. 

Our appetizer, the cream cheese-based Kilmore Quay Crab Dip, was loaded with lump crab meat and baby spinach, making it an ooey gooey mortar for the chewy but crisp garlic pita toast points that were tasty enough to be eaten plain, quite frankly. A similar starter from Thee Olde Place Inn was pleasantly recalled. 

In regards to my main course, I did something I have never done before. 

When my medium-rare burger came to the table with all the pink and juiciness cooked out of it, I sent it back.

The exchange resulted in a profit of flavor via a luscious, rosy patty that dripped flavor like a honeydew melon. The Steel City Burger giddily defames Primanti Brothers by including a milky cole slaw (instead of a vinaigrette slaw) and peeled french fries (adequately prepared to boot) inside a wrinkled, glossy, soft, buttered bun. Each bite was creamy, crunchy, carnivorous joy. 

A helping of housemade, cauldron-crisp potato chips completed the entree for me in sea-salted, can't-eat-just-one, gourmet supermarket fashion. And there was a time when I thought New York Deli's purple bags of chips were the snack food pinnacle. Damn, was I young and sheltered. 

Ah! Fashion. Well, I may not recall our server's name, but I do recall that she was dressed like any other gal you'd see walking or jogging about in comfortable athletic attire. Lascivious? Revealing? Inappropriate? Hardly. Furthermore, she was attentive, talkative, and very nice to my girlfriend and I. 

I just turned 40, am in a serious relationship, and I liked McFadden's more than I anticipated. 

P.S. The joint is as spacious as a fire hall. Throw a bash! 

P.P.S. I do agree with other reviewers who stated that the food is a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"I got cut off after spending too much money for my friends birthday and the food is fucking horrible. The service is awful and very sexist. Don't ever come here"}
{"text":"So I guess when you order a spicy chicken sandwich, and the description says \"buffalo style chicken topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and ranch\" you really don't get the ranch-which makes the sandwich completely awful. Nice going"}
{"text":"Though you probably won't be super impressed with the food at McFadden's, I think it deserves credit for what it is - a Steelers bar. It stands as my favorite place in the North Shore to watch the game, whether we are playing home or away. It's always a fun atmosphere. Usually the food will do the trick for what you need which is some bar food. Certainly don't come here expecting fine dining...but do expect a good time!"}
{"text":"Okay place to spend some time before a Pirates game. It can be hot in there when crowded but they have decent specials."}
{"text":"This place could be fun if it didn't have the most degenerate staff in all of Pittsburgh. The staff they have is so high and mighty and will bully people to feel like they have purpose. It's nothing special for the cover, I'm happy to know I'll never never go again."}
{"text":"Crappy food, crappy service, crappy beer, an owner with no spine, but near PNC. So there is that."}
{"text":"I went early and stayed late on a Saturday night.  There was no problem accommodating our large party (20+) around 8pm.  Once the DJ started it did get crowded and getting to the bar was a tad difficult.  Great place for dancing and drinking! Parking across the street was only $5."}
{"text":"The one thing this place has going for it is location to PNC Park. I think it just sucks in the tourists that have no idea where to get a meal or drink. Food is subpar and generally takes about 3x longer to be made than normal. Bartenders are generally overwhelmed and with that comes bad attitudes and lack of attentiveness. It's truly amazing that this place is still open.  Really nothing going for it unless you are a barely 21 yr old looking to hookup with a drunk girl who couldn't afford a ticket to a Steelers game."}
{"text":"This place is a drinking establishment first, dance club second, restaurant and quality of food is last. Basically if you've drank too much, go ahead and start soaking up some of that alcohol with a basic burger, wings or what have you. 

The place is huge, lots of Televisions, big dance floor and plenty of overly expensive alcohol. There are better places in Pittsburgh or on the North Shore to eat and drink."}
{"text":"I mean....it is what it is.  A bar, that's on the North Shore, by the stadium.  'Nough said, right?  Ok, maybe not....

The food, unremarkable.  The drinks, you know...normal offerings.  The chick bartenders, dressed to impress...the dudes.  

I wish there was more to say or better yet, more to do on the North Shore, but it just hasn't happened yet.  I'm waiting...I'll be here.  You know where to find me!"}
{"text":"Our company closed down for the day and was taking the crew out for the day of eats and the Pirate game .we had a reservation for 25 when we got to the restaurant  we ask if we could sit outside and we were told yes but not to move the tables around and that people smoke out there not a problem since a third of the people we work with smoke. The waitress was a very sweet girl but overwhelmed since she was the only one taking care of us WTF. the few times the other girl came out she was dismissive just as the other reviews state. She told one of us that they don't have BBQ sauce during game nights????.My sister asked for a rolling rock and a hour later told her they didn't have it. My daughter asked with ID in hand for a ic light mango and she just walked by So i pretty much Knew that wasn't going to happen.. Drinks were never served food that was ordered never came. I get it sometime mistakes happen most likely before a Pirate game but when we got there at 430 they weren't busy and My husband sitting at a bar table was not  even asked if he wanted a drink as he sat in the Bar waiting to direct the other people we were waiting for to their seats The hostesses and there were a few couldn't be bothered with that to busy talking to each other.My only guess is poor management I mean The Pirates are playing on Father's day weekend and you are sadly understaffed . The waitress who was trying so hard to take care of us and  I hope you Are not turned off by this .I personally felt you did as best as you could just under bad management . I'm not just a person who doesn't understand  Our company is a restaurant we were all wait staff bartenders and owners of a restaurant.and we tried to help out as much as we could We all been crazy busy ourselves We told the girl who brought out food out  to put the tray down on the table and call out the food we would come to her since they had no tray jacks. it should of been better. Thankfully the beautiful Park and The Pirates winning saved the day"}
{"text":"I stopped in here to drown my sorrows after the Cubs lost to the Pirates 12-0. It's right across from PNC Park and was a block from my hotel so I appreciated the close location. I visited on a Monday night (Labor Day) so it obviously was not very busy. We grabbed seats at the bar and were served right away. I ordered a Jameson and Coke and the Coke was very flat, but the Jameson was what I was really after, anyway. The interior is spacious, the bar is big and there are lots of seating areas away from the bar if you want to sit and grab a bite to eat. I didn't try the food so I can't comment on that, but this seemed like a pretty standard sports bar where you could grab some pub food, drinks, and watch a game."}
{"text":"Literally have never been treated better by a manager or staff at any bar in Pittsburgh or maybe the east coast. Absolutely the spot to go before or after a game. Thanks to McFaddens for being the best yinzer atmosphere in the Burgh ~ Nicole"}
{"text":"From out of town going to a Penguins and Steeler/Giants game, looking for some beers and music.

This place has it's good and bad, mostly good.  

The bar is huge, so it makes it easy to find a couple of seats until the craziness starts.

Tons of bar staff, so no really long waits for beer.

Don't be in a hurry for food when they're busy.  Not a real complaint, just be prepared.  The food itself is OK, just bar food to help avoid a major hangover the next day.

The beer selection was good, cold and not too over priced.

Not a Penn sports guy, so seeing the Joe Paterno mega huge head being paraded around when Penn State scored was a little over the top.  I know they loved the Lions, but please take a minute and check yourselves.  What happened there and what JoPa turned a blind eye to doesn't deserve celebrating."}
