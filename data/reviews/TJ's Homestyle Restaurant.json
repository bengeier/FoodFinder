{"text":"This is my first experience at this restaurant. The place is ok, i guess their idea is to make you feel like home. However, the service is really bad. There is no courtesy at all, you can tell that they don't enjoy their job. You better have ready what you want because any single thing that you want to change in your order right after the waitress wrote in her piece of paper will make them mad and that's when their ok mood will change. I can tell that they hire anyone, because there is not courtesy or any sign of education. And I won't forget that my girlfriend ordered coffee and they brought the coffee in a cup that it looked I want to think that the dishwasher couldn't wash it correctly because the cup still had the red lipstick from the previous customer that used the cup. REALLY UNACCEPTABLE. We brought that to the waitress attention and she didn't even acknowledge or say anything about the nasty cup the she brought us, she just took it and brought us another cup of coffee. In conclusion this place needs to be a little more clean and they need to have people with better customer service skills."}
{"text":"No one is friendly, including the owner. Service is slow. Food is very plain, bland. Food was mediocre. Even the toast was mediocre. Our waitress was pretty good. The cinnamon roll was good. My husband liked his omelette. It is very loud."}
{"text":"My regular place for breakfast!  People are friendly and the food is great!  If you go away hungry it's because someone else ate your food. Portions are plentiful.  I challenge anyone to find a better place in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great. My breakfast hit the spot thanks to her suggestion. Quick service. Attentive. We plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing experience. It was not because of my very gracious server Kim, but because of the manner in which another server, Donna, acted. To my disbelief, this incredibly unprofessional person decided it was ok to humiliate Kim by yelling at her several times in front of a room full of patrons for not cleaning a table fast enough. Donna's lack of patience was disgusting to say the least. When I confronted her she said I had no right to question her. When I asked for a manager she said \"he doesn't want to talk to you.\"  I have been a customer for some time now but because of Donna, my family and I will not return."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because it is local and close to my house but NOTHING has an flavor. Super bland...."}
{"text":"I've been to TJ's twice (both on Sundays - September 13 and 20). The September 13th visit was great. Food was delicious, service was fine, overall wonderful. But when I went back on the 20th I had a completely different experience. The first thing I noticed was a sign on the door that indicated they would no longer be allowing any changes or substitutions to menu items and that there were NO EXCEPTIONS. My concern is that someone I was with has severe food allergies and someone else I was with, while not allergic, gets really sick when he eats tomatoes. This limited what they could eat, and one of them wanted to leave while the other had an anxiety attack because she was worried she wouldn't be able to eat. While the staff was friendly and we worked something out, the one who couldn't eat tomatoes spent $5 when he would have spent $10, and the emotional stress it caused the other member of our group made the experience unpleasant. My biggest issue overall was the wording posted everywhere about why this change was made. Overall, it was clear that it had been written in anger, and it came off as rude, condescending, and so anti-customer that I'm hesitant to go back. I know some customers can be total jerks. I absolutely get that. But this response made me feel like they were so angry at a few terrible customers that they didn't care who else they turned away. I'm hoping their approach to handling customers will improve soon, because the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!!! Probably my favorite place to go eat. Have yet to try lunch. I imagine that if breakfast is this good lunch and dinner will be outstanding. I ate the Big breakfast!!! The bacon was extra crispy but not burned. The butter is whipped almost looks like it is home made. My son had the farmers breakfast. He could not finish it simply because it was too much for him to finish."}
{"text":"Great find! First time here. Waitress was extremely friendly. Owner came over to make sure we were enjoying the meal. I had the Spanish omelet. The salsa was very good! Biscuits and gravy were tasty.. Gravy was good with a fresh made heavy biscuit. Over all despite the outside appearance and bric-a-brac decor, we will def be returning!"}
{"text":"We love the staff... we love the atmosphere...we love the food...we love the prices!  Never disappointed and look forward to Sunday breakfast with the family at TJ's.  BEST CINNAMON ROLLS EVER."}
{"text":"Wasn't even there for 10 minutes and had to leave. I was treated like I was a bother and was never even greeted. I walked to the table by a waitress who set the menus down and walked away, not even a hello or a good morning. I was already disappointed and then after having all of 2 minute to look at the menu I was asked by a DIFFERENT waitress \"are you about ready yet?\"..... Still no hello or any sort of greeting. The food may be good but the service is in the gutter. Just because you hate your job don't make the customers feel awkward or unwanted. Will never return and I hope the two rude waitresses learn from their mistakes and wait on people better in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I are a bit split on this one, but I think it's a question of expectations versus reality.  Hers: \"I expected greasy diner and got definitely-not-greasy-great food and friendly service!\"  Mine: \"I expected a great breakfast experience and got a good one.\"  Food: Best thing was the eggs.  I had an omelette that was very fluffy, my wife had eggs benedict that was great.  My wife's hashbrowns were also good, mine were a bit cool and undercooked.  Overall, though, a good traditional breakfast.  Service: Friendly, VERY fast.  Partly because of the big line, I suspect.  Still, we weren't rushed out or anything.  Overall, probably the best choice in the area for a traditional, non-chain breakfast place.  (But maybe the ONLY such choice?)  Also, not very expensive ($6-7 for an omelette, hashbrowns or pancakes, and toast).  They close at 2pm most days except Friday's, btw."}
{"text":"My waitress Brenda was all about the Benjamin's and she didn't get my food right -.- but over all my food was yummy !"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was little.  Some people do not like the mom and pop restaurant because they are not that modern.  I think these are places are great. This is a great place to go.  They have a lot of good old fashioned comfort food.  This place is very simple so if you are looking for a grand place this is not it.  But good food and good people are always here. Very family freindly."}
{"text":"First time here, when pulling up the parking lot was full.  We ate breakfast on Sunday morning, the portions were large, good variety on the menu and the food tasted great. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was the cleanliness of the place.  Light fixtures and window sills were in bad need of dusting.  No matter how good the food, prices or service there is no greater turn off then sitting next to a window with dead flies laying there."}
{"text":"good basic food, generous portion and friendly staff. my favorite for breakfast even for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Down home, great food. The cinnamon rolls are incredible. The servers and bussers are SLO super friendly and very attentive-our coffee cups never went empty! I don't live in the area but would come here anytime I'm nearby."}
{"text":"As my family and I walked in they were nice but we felt rushed. The cooks kept watching us as we talking to each other like they were wanting to leave. When we sat down the waitress told the cook that there were three people to be served and he through a fit. The eggs were not cooked all the way and the bacon and ham look as if it has been sitting for hours. Other than that it was alright."}
{"text":"I would have given this a 5 star rating last year. Food and service has been downgraded along with long life customers.  A bigger restaurant means a bigger kitchen. Don, I hope you are reading this.    Don't come hungry I tell you.  By the time your order is taken and your meal brought to the table you will probably be starving. Why does staff get upset when our order is not correct? Save your self an argument.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype!! The service time is ridiculously SLOW!!! First time here and not that impressed. Food is good but as good as you can get for COLD food."}
{"text":"Tj is a mom and pop restaurant the food is really good and the price s on the food are conformable.  I will came back to AZ for more."}
{"text":"For anyone in the West Valley this place is second to none. The best fish fry on Fridays. Great food from breakfast to dinner. The best news is they are now open Saturday and Sunday till 9pm that's in addition to Friday evenings for their fish fry. So Fri thru Sun open till 9pm The staff owner and mom are great as well. Not just good at their job but friendly as well. My family will continue to be frequent fliers here. Forgot about their desserts. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating breakfast Saturday and Sunday at TJ's for the last few years.  Local owners, loyal staff and the vast majority of the patron's are repeat locals.  Great food, too much, but great!  Gets pretty busy Saturday and Sunday mornings... We try to get there around 8:00 am.  I work in San Francisco and commute back to Goodyear every weekend; breakfast at TJ's with my wife sure helps make it all worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Every time we come into town TJ's is a stop.  We'd like to get try everything on the menu, but can't get past the bone-in ham and eggs!!! Belinda gave us outstanding service! Thank you TJ's!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place.  I know most people don't love oatmeal but it is my favorite and since I consider myself an oatmeal afficionado it is the second best oatmeal ever (Grandma's oatmeal comes in first).  The french toast is incredible and the place is awesome.  It feels like home."}
{"text":"Food is just ok but if you don't like to wait avoid this place during the morning rush. Waited an hour after seated to get our food and it wasn't even the whole order once I got it."}
{"text":"I am sorry I forgot to take a picture of the  food but the food was great friendly people we had a nice time we will go back again next time we in town"}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment!  The only reason I decided to come here is because I had purchased a Groupon that came with a $100 gift certificate to Restaurants.com and this was one of the restaurants on there and is close to where some of my friends live so I thought I would give it a shot and buy a $15 gift certificate.  (For those of you that are not familiar with Restaurants.com it's basically like Groupon the $15 gift certificate I bought meant that I had to spend $30 total.)  I arrived around noon today (Sunday) and was surprised at how busy they were so I assumed it must be a pretty good place to eat.  Man was I wrong?!!  First when I walked in there was a sign that says \"Please wait to be seated\" so I waited patiently for a hostess to seat me.  There were no fewer than 5 workers that either walked past or glared at me and the few other customers waiting to be seated before a guy that I assume is the manager or owner that rudely asked how many were with each of our parties.  No \"Welcome to TJ's\" or \"We will be right there.\"  And I mentioned to the lady that came in behind me that I thought that the guy was rude and she thought the same thing.  Oh well,  I work in customer service myself so I know some days are hard to be upbeat to everyone so no big deal.  Since I was by myself I said I would just sit at the counter.  Once I sat down I let the waitress know I had the Restaurant.com gift card and she made sure I knew I had to spend at least $30 to use it and I told her I knew that and would be ordering food to go for some friends after I ate my lunch and she said that would be fine.  I got the Biscuits and Gravy with a sausage link and it was terrible.  I didn't even eat half of it because it was so bland.    So as I was waiting for my waitress to write up my bill another waitress overheard I was trying to take food to go and she said that wasn't allowed with the Restaurant.com gift cards.  She went to get the manager/owner and he said it was dine in only.  After telling him I thought it was ridiculous that they wouldn't allow me to order food to go he reluctantly said he would \"OK it\" like he was doing me a huge favor.  Does it really matter if someone eats the food in their restaurant or at home?  Am I not still spending $30?  And considering it was busy when I was there isn't it better that I was taking food to go as opposed to bringing other people in with me that would have been taking up extra seats?  The waitress I had was very nice but several of the others working weren't.  The place was not very clean and I am sure if the health department were to pay them a visit they would have more than a few violations.  I honestly don't know how this place is ever busy based on my experience and apparently many others like me after reading through several other posts.  The location of this place is not great so I can only surmise that 90% of the people that go there live close by because the food is not worth driving out of the way for and the cleanliness and hospitality are definitely lacking.  Take my advice and skip trying this place out because it is not worth it!"}
{"text":"Food here is delicious my family and I always go here after mass on Sundays. Food is not something I will complain about the cooks are amazimg at what they do. Which is why you have continued to come here over the years. Now on another note. DONNA is the worst waitress ever. My last straw would defitnitly be after this Sunday. I'm not sure if this lady is racist or what her deal is but every time my family and I go and we get her as a server she treats us like DIRT. She always acts like shes too busy to take our order or we are not important enough for us to be served by her. We have complained about her in the past but I'm sure the owners don't care. My mom and I are both servers and know what it means to be busy in a rush and what it means to be treated the way this lady treats us. Its disappointing that managment still allows her to be a server and treat their customers the way she does. If you support a company to allow there employees to mistreat their customers then this is the  place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Seated right away. :)  Server was right on it, did her job professionally. +++  My order was accurate, no need to send back. :)  Coffee brand was real good, no need to drink coffee later.  :)  Food portion was good.  :)  Had the choice of hash browns or host potatos, choose house potatoes by recommendation, but what I got was plain square potatoes with no flavor, I guess I was expecting onions and bell pepper :(  My hamburger patty had 0 flavor and wet. I guess I expected a hand-pattied type instead of processed patty :(  My toast was buttered perfectly, but sadly, I thought they would offer a home made type jelly or something instead of smuckers packet.  :("}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if possible. First time trying this place and we waited over 30 minutes because they didn't even bother calling in order. Then once we were seated we ordered and it took literally 45 minutes to get our food. Plus to make matters worse there was a hair in my hash browns. I have to say the waitress was a nice lady and food was decent but the experience was absolutely horrible due to the lack of customer service. Even at check out the older lady had a nasty attitude and made personal comments that she had no business making. I will never return here not even if it was the last place on earth to eat!"}
{"text":"I know this is a favorite for many, but I don't know what all the hype is about. Our meals were ok. Nothing memorable or special about anything we tried."}
{"text":"Food was good, prices were good, service was aweful. Waited 35 minutes for someone to come to our table so we could get a to go box, nothing, no refill on coffee or anything else. Finally ask the guy up front for a box and left. They were busy so I guess they don't need our business, really too bad as we liked the food."}
{"text":"Hands down great food the wait was a little long but well worth it I would eat here again on my next visit to Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Was disappointed.  Chicken fried steak was not eatable.   Was referred to it by a friend that knows I seek out old independent places. Went out of my way to try it.    I will try again but something different.  If I'm in the area.   ."}
{"text":"First off the food is pretty good. It's not amazing but good for the money spent. My wife loves the biscuits and their scrambles will fill you up.  The one downfall to TJ's is the owner, at least I believe he is the owner. From the four or five times I have been here I have overheard him drop the f bomb, talk down to his employees, degrade women and talk badly of them, and be very harsh with the customers and waitresses. It is to the point that my wife doesn't like going there and would rather me pick up the food and bring it home.   Just beware if you go here you will find good food but a nasty owner at the front."}
{"text":"Went with a friend had breakfast had their French toast ,hash brown and egg's coffee it was very good!! went a few more times and very good food !"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Food and service deliver. Be prepared to wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Wow!  It was Saturday, the weekend before Christmas, at the BUSIEST time of the day and this place was PACKED! The parking lot was full and  there was standing room only in the foyer. BUT it was my Dad's birthday and my son had just gotten home from basic training.  what were the chances? We had called ahead at 1015  and asked for a table for nine. At 1045, just as they had promised, our table was waiting for us!! Our waitress was cracking jokes as she rocked an incredible number of tables. Not one drink was empty and the food arrived hot and at the same time! It was so delicious that we all ate every bite!! We left with a rhubarb and a cherry pie... Made from scratch! Best experience evah!!!  If I could've given it ten stars I would!! Must have been a Christmas Miracle!!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent TJ's most Sundays. Used to doesn't mean we don't enjoy the place, we just have had to cut back on stuff just like everyone else and that special Sunday breakfast happens to be one of them.   We have been going here for several years and have enjoyed most everything we've tried. I will agree with Scott O's wife, the eggs benedict are FABULOUS! It's usually one of the specials when we've gone.   OMG-the biscuits and gravy. Yummy, yummy in the tummy!   The chicken cordon bleu sandwich, also good. The chicken breast is a nice hearty size. I usually eat without the bun so I can finish the moist chicken breast covered with ham and melted swiss. Roommate likes the fact that you can get cross cut fries or tater tots in lieu of french fries.  Pies, let me tell you about their pies.  They are delicious.  Flaky crust, usually a huge variety.  Cream pies, fruit pies, seasonal pies, they go quick.   Servings are generous. Many dishes are like good old fashioned comfort food.   The owner is a nice guy. He's been there pretty much every time we've been there. He's very involved in the goings on. Service has always been pretty quick, even when the place is bulging at the seams.   Fridays they are open for dinner too. Have gone a couple times for the all you can eat fish fry.   Stop by sometime if you're in the neighborhood. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time Father's Day 2015, super busy but worth the wait. The portions were huge (and I don't usually have a problem with huge portions) you could easily order one breakfast and share with your spouse. Between our party of four we had chicken fried steak, bacon, spanish omlette, hash browns, biscuits and gravy, eggs over easy, pancakes, it was all great."}
{"text":"Excellent service and reasonably priced.  Small and clean establishment.   Breakfast items, such as Belgium waffles, pancakes and veggie omelet, are very good.  Not fancy.  They close after lunch so check if they are open beforehand."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast, ended up having lunch. That slow and late we got our food. Exaggerating little bit, but be prepared to wait for ever. Food was good, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it's always great. The pancakes are the best and the portions are huge. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Called at 930 am on new years day for a party of 25 to arrive at 11am. Wow,  the table was ready when we got there. Jennifer and Donna did an amazing job getting all of us taken of. Food was great, quick and freash. Great place."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times now, last couple of visits I haven't been as happy with service or food    I do like the cafe feel to the place, very little of those left.   I will go again, but it will be the last time if I'm disappointed again"}
{"text":"We always wondered why this little hole in the wall restaurant was always so busy. Well, there's a reason for that. The food is absolutely amazing! Down-home cooking homemade bread and don't forget those humongous raisin cinnamon rolls the size of your head! The French toast is made with homemade French bread and thick cut.  The cinnamon toast was thick cut and homemade also. My husband who is a real biscuits and gravy nut said that they were outstanding.  The Decor is well...kitschy but like you would expect at grandma's house.  I noticed they had a nice bakery goods area where you could bring things home to eat including pies but will need to try that next time.  Highly recommend (but good luck finding a parking spot!)"}
{"text":"If you don't like homestyle cooking, friendly wait staff, or excellent quality food, don't go here!  This is a must visit restaurant."}
{"text":"The family and I were undecided what we wanted for dinner.  We wanted something inexpensive but tasted good.  Everyone was tired of the same old fast food places we have in the west valley.  I pulled up yelp an saw the reviews for this place.  I have to admit this is a place I avoided for my own reasons but glad I decided to give it a try.  I got the all you can eat fish fry, wife got the corn beef and the kids had stuff from the kids menu.  Everyone was happy with their meals and we will be back to try their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday morning at 9am. The place was packed, and the wait was 10-15 minutes.  We ordered the Friday special (green chilli shredded beef omelette) and chicken fried steak with eggs (done overeasy). The green chilli shredded beef was amazing. The chicken fried steak was OK. The eggs were done perfecly. The servings were pretty big. We also got a big cinammon roll which was pretty good. Overall, it was a pretty good eating experience."}
{"text":"Returned to TJ twice since last review. Oct 2014. Now open for Broasted Chicken on Sunday. Owner Don has done a complete turn around and is now a pleasant guy. Wait staff is great and so is the food. Keep up the good attitude. Great bakery and best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Rude host...long wait...rushed to eat n go! Table side service and food were good/ok Place needs a good cleaning n makeover"}
{"text":"TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is something unique ... and it shouldn't be unique at all:  an actual mom and pop restaurant.  In the Valley of the Sun, that's a dying breed, which for the most part has yielded to chain restaurants that have undercut them and suffering in Depression-Era economics, forcing them to stay competitive while their former customers are blowing their brains out or jumping out of windows after having lost their homes  (I'm such a cheery person, ain't I?).  So given the irresistible double squeeze of cheesy chain restaurants and empty wallets, you shouldn't come in here expecting fine dining or even fine decoration.  You come here to eat and if you sometimes have to ignore the basic furnishings and a not-so-spic-n-span room, then that's what you do:  after all, is YOUR mom and pop's place sparkling clean all the time?!?  Portions here are more than adequate and often too adequate (oink, oink).  The food is usually quite good and this applies especially to breakfast food.  I like the back room of the restaurant, which is simple, gives you a not-so-great view of Avondale out the window, and can be a tight fit.  But it's this very basic atmosphere which lends the place its authentic diner-like charm from an age, not so long ago, when diners weren't an extinct entity going the way of the Brontosaurus (speaking of \"brontosaurus\", do you REALLY need both bacon AND ham with your THREE egg breakfast?!?).  Service, when I've come here, has always been good.  I do recommend, that you do NOT look past the double doors into the kitchen, if you're sitting in the back:  it might ruin some fantasies you have about some elderly mother cooking your eggs, while pa is out back chopping wood for the stove.  Come here to enjoy a very hearty breakfast, good service and attitudes and atmosphere from a bygone age.  It beats out IHOP, Waffle House and many other places, that have your breakfast sitting in pots and pans waiting to be reheated like so many assembly-line draftees.  This is what America once was ... you either find that charming or backwards.  If the latter, go to Denny's or Village Inn and get what you deserve!"}
{"text":"The food was \"okay\" but way to expensive for breakfast.... $25 for one person for breakfast.... yikes! I will probably eat here again but not as a first choice. 3 stars for food and 2 stars for the prices."}
{"text":"This place is just plain awesome. Good prices,  great service and great food. The portions are huge!!! That homestyle cooking that everyone loves. I wish I lived in Phoenix because this would be a regular stop. If you are in the area this is a must try."}
{"text":"I was finally able to get into TJ's yesterday and I'm glad I did. The food was homemade home style deliciousness at dirt cheap prices. My party got the cinnamon roll French toast and the farmers breakfast. Obviously not the healthiest dining option, but that's not why you go to TJ's, you go here to indulge in home cooking. Finally found my favorite breakfast joint in Avondale!"}
{"text":"The owner (manager) is really bringing this place down to the ground. Customers and Waitress are abused right in front of you. Long time paying  customer no more. At least there's Big Bear Diner still!"}
{"text":"No frills diner with great breakfast. The biscuits and gravy are the best in town. The green chile shredded beef omelet is often one of the specials and is my husband's favorite. Lines can be long on Sunday morning, but they work to get you in fast. Try the counter for a shorter wait. The cinnamon rolls are huge and delicious. I've been here over twenty times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Solid place to hit for breakfast with any close friends or family! Great service and the food was spectacular. I will always go with hash browns, eggs, bacon and if I can, chicken fried steak.. which here, was superb. Just wish the portions were a little bigger. I think it's important to support local businesses! Next time instead of dennys or IHOP come check this place out"}
{"text":"This a local place. Americana style food and atmosphere. Great decor that makes it feel comfortable. The service staff was very friendly. She was able to meet our needs. I ordered the special- philly cheese steak. I am not a philly cheese expert. The sandwich was very basic. The size of this special was filling. It was the sandwich, onion rings, and a little cup of potato soup. The philly had thin slices meat, but too little of it. The soup was bland. The onion rings were great. The meal filled me but was not flavorful or recommended."}
{"text":"Another fantastick \"mom and pop\" in the Phoenix area.  Their chili is just great.  Their hamburger and fries special is a good value.  I highly recommend this place.  My wife likes their breakfast and pancakes specials."}
{"text":"So trying TJ's again and think I should have gone to Angeles or waffle house if I was driving this far.... service very slow for 7am and the toast I ordered was butter with a little bread, unmelted. When I pointed this out to the waiter, one of the 3 times of my total interaction with her, nothing was offered to remedy it like maybe a new order of toast...."}
{"text":"First time here, we ordered the TJ's Club, I didn't enjoy it, the meat tasted funny, the steak fries and the service was good. The inside of the restaurant is pleasant , I like the country theme."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast during our visit to Scottsdale. Pulling up to the restaurant, I had to convince my wife and in-laws to give it a try. I had read reviews here on Yelp and told them to stick with me. So we went in and the  people were friendly. They had to put a couple of tables together and unfortunately sat us in the back because of the limited space up front. Still, I persuaded the family to give it a chance. After what seemed like a lengthy wait, we ordered the food. Very quickly our waitress was back with our orders. Everything looked and smelled good. The taste and portion sizes finally put to rest any concerns we may have had about this place. Everyone, including the kids enjoyed eating a very feeling breakfast. It was a great way to start off a long day.  If you're looking for good ol' fashioned breakfast then do yourself a favor, look past the rough exterior and stop in for a good meal."}
{"text":"Good food, if you don't mind waiting.  I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday morning at about 10 AM after finding the place onYelp. There was about a 15 minute wait to for an open table, but when we got there the table was clean and we were waited on quickly. We ordered once our drinks arrived, then waited til about 11 before we received our plates. The food was good though and as the place was packed I would say that had a good deal to do with the long wait.  I would say the atmosphere is that of an old diner that had the soul taking out to belong to a chain, and people actually seem to give two sh*ts about the service.  I would definitely go again for a good breakfast, but I'll make sure I don't need to be anywhere else for a couple of hours.  P.S. If you like a nice clean car, you may want to steer clear of their dirt parking lot."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast and pie place but sadly must boycott. How they perceive paying minimum wage increases is a sad statement on how they treat their employees."}
{"text":"Love TJ's!  We go often for a quick lunch or as a large group.  The owner's son can often,'okay most of the time be a grump but still gets it done.  I often say smile and he struggles!  The Mom is great, after having a friend pay for a pie Thanksgiving morning, she made sure it was put aside for me upon pick up.  I was extremely grateful.  I have never had a bad experience with my own orders with the exception of burnt pancakes that took 15 minutes to arrive, it was busy and I wasn't in a major rush.  The waitresses are always so kind and generous and remember us.    Baked goods are delicious and so worth it!"}
{"text":"Anyone who eats at TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is taking their life into their own hands!  Seriously, We sat at the counter and I have NEVER seen such a disgusting display of unsafe food handling.  There was one waitress working that was not sick all of the rest were and non bothered to wash their hands after coughing into them, or touching dirty rags, or running their hands through their greasy hair.  Our waitress took our orders then ignored us, fortunately the gal not coughing on herself was the one that realized our food was sitting there getting old.  The 2 people seated and served after us had already gotten their food and left the restaurant before we got our food.  Prices were cheap, but in this case you really do get what you paid for.  Definately not worth the wait for a seat.  NOT worth your time!"}
{"text":"I had not eaten here in years. I remember the food having more flavor with larger portions. Bacon was burnt pancakes were flat and the plates I was served on were dirty! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Couldn't find a parking spot Great location prices are fare food brought out cheese melted in front of me, well worth the wait will be back to try lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and was looking for a restaurant with a good breakfast. I have passed by TJ's a few times and parking lot seemed to be pretty busy. Well the restaurant is nice enough and quite large, but bigger is not always better. I ordered scrambled eggs and well done toast. What I got was barely warm eggs that had shells mixed in and some soggy bread (not toast) even though I asked for well done. Don't think any special attention is given to their food since menu is large and they are just trying to get patrons in and out. Don't bother going there if you're looking for good food."}
{"text":"Best home style breakfast, dinner and pies I've had in a very long time! As a kid I enjoyed going to places like this with my family. We went twice in one week first to try breakfast and second for dinner. Their biscuits are humongous with a generous portion of gravy. Biscuits and gravy are one of my favorite dishes to have when dining or for breakfast and here your not going to be disappointed. The open face meatloaf sandwich I had for dinner was comfort food at its finest. I ended my evening by taking home a whole chocolate mousse pie that's not going to break the bank at just $12.99. My son wanted to get a slice of Pecan pie so definitely couldn't pass that up and it was the best I've had. A small little shop located in old town Avondale and for sure a local favorite. Prices and portions cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place. I have been by that area so many times and had no idea it was there. Older place in a strip mall. We had the cinnamon roll, green chili beef omelette and eggs Benedict. Service was quick and friendly. Lots of seating. Will go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"A nice hidden treasure.  The place is ran by a local family that serves great food, healthy portions & fast service.  We enjoyed our breakfast & even took home one of their homemade cinnamon rolls for later.  We were visiting the area and a friend who lives in the area recommended the place.  Busy but not a long wait obviously the locals also love the place."}
{"text":"One of the things I noticed about Avondale Arizona is the abundance of chain restaurant establishments, especially north of I-10 off of Dysart Road. But if you venture on the south side of the 10, you will come across TJ's.   TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is about as un-chain as you will find in these parts. A true mom-and-pop diner that serves up meals that scream comfort. My experience here came on the morning I made my way back to California after nearly a week on the road in Arizona visiting family. I can thank my brother and sister-in-law for taking me here on this morning visit.   Arrived to a near empty restaurant and sat down and ordered up their Ham and Mushroom omelet which came with four golden pancakes. The omelet was simple and fresh and the pancakes were fluffy and reminded me of my grandmother's pancakes (just a little beyond golden brown...but not burnt). The Hot Chocolate was out of this world good...super chocolatey and smooth with the dollop of whipped cream on top.     The service is friendly but real cut and dry about things...like \"tell me what you want and make it fast\". I kind of like that about this place as it's a real locals spot (witnessed locals talking about family and life with the waitress and each other). I also found it amusing that the cook came out and observed our order being taken...I guess he wants to make sure there's no mistake or screw ups in between us and him.   Avondale is lucky to have a place like this...seriously...with a town full of chain restaurants, TJ's gives Avondale some much needed character when it comes to dining options."}

{"text":"First off, our servers name was Brenda. Now I have served most of my life, so when I eat out I make a point to be very nice and tip well. This day, Dec. 26 at 12:30pm, I was peeved to say the least. Brenda was either having an off day or had things going on that she was letting affect her work because she was very transparent about not liking or wanting to be at her job. I tried to be as nice as I could because I know serving can be rough but by the time we sat down and got our drinks it was an hour and 15 minutes before we were checked on. Come the fuck on. Yes we ordered and got our drinks when we sat down, but I have a very impatient 9 month old that needed more juice and SOMETHING to snack on. Anyway once the food arrived it was heat lamp warm, and one dish was room temp. Not to mention the hash browns were so greasy my husband was sick. I was so hungry that I didn't send it back because I didn't trust the food to get back in a decent amount of time. My son HAD to eat. I still tipped her and cleaned up, but I will not be returning and I hope the rest of you have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"Fabulous!! Enough to feed an army! Everything is homemade! Salsa, cinnamon raisin toast!! Excellent! Service is awesome as well! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad and the service was great. My problem lies with the owner who seated us and the way he spoke to the waitress cleaning the table so we could sit down. I don't know if she wasn't moving fast enough for him or what but he barked at her and she said \"almost done\" and then he commenced to chewing her out and said \"keep your mouth shut and clean the table\". I almost turned around and left but we wanted breakfast.  This is no way to speak to your employees and I was waiting for John Quinones to come out and ask \"what would you do?\"."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday around 11:00. The wait was over 30 minutes. 10-15 minutes for straws that she forgot to drop off with drinks, and Another 30+ minutes for food to arrive. Corned beef hash tasted like it was from the can & my toast was burnt. The food was okay, nothing special. Definitely not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  The meals are huge but I was very pleased to find smaller portions in the VIP section."}
{"text":"If the food would come out at one time , that would be great. Far too many minutes in between plates being served.  Don't get me wrong the food is pretty good not the greatest but good, One of the managers or owners was a bit unfriendly. I'll pass next time but knock yourself out."}
{"text":"I have taken my wife and kids here on numerous occasions and it is always a good experience.  The service is fast and friendly.  The portions are generous and tasty.  This place is just a old fashion family owned diner."}
{"text":"This is very down home good cooking.  The cinnamon bun was amazing.  HUGE, butter, lots of icing.  I thought I had a sweet tooth and this was a bit much for me.  Delicious though.  Was a little disappointed with my omelet, had the southwest special, it was light on the chorizo.  But the side... Full Order of Biscuits & Gravy... made up for the whole meal.  Amazingly light, fluffy, right out of the oven biscuit.  And the sausage gravy is some of the best I've had in AZ hands down.  And a full order is also HUGE.  I imagine all the plates are that way which makes it that much better cause you always have something to take home.  Prices were relatively cheap as well.  Was surprised how cheap two of us got out of there for breakfast along with 3 pieces of pie/cake to go.  If I lived on the west side, this would be a bad place for me but definitely good eats."}
{"text":"First time here today with the family and it was pretty good!  Prices were fine and the food was good!  We had the omelets (1 ham & egg, 1 bacon, sausage & cheese), Raisin toast, waffles, french toast, potatoes and Farmers Breakfast.  We bought a loaf of the Raisin, a bit pricey (8.70), but it's good!  We will come back :)"}
{"text":"Homestyle, big, greasy, delicious breakfasts!!! The wait staff has been there forever and are really helpful with menu. Get there super early on weekends as it's PACKED!!! Love it here."}
{"text":"Today my family and I went here for breakfast, there was 11 of us total, the service started was great ! Brenda was our server she got all of our food out just the way we ordered it, refills were always brought back . Food was delicious! Their was just a small mistake on our checks (not a big deal) but THE MANAGER ON DUTY WAS SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!! RUDE!! Totally humiliating Brenda on the floor in front of us and other guests, people make mistakes we had no problem what so ever waiting for it to be resolved,but this douchebag manager was just making a scene making himself look like an Ass! Because of a small mixup on our checks he blew up and was yelling at the cashier to find Brenda!! And told another guest that she doesn't no anything he's smarter than her! What the hell! Shame on you! You are no better than anyone else your attitude sucks! You obviously hate your job douchebag!  But for Brenda keep up the good job you were amazing!! Karma will come his way.  Mean people suck."}
{"text":"Breakfast food was average. I had the eggs Benedict (a special). Eggs were overcooked and not enough hollandaise. Has towns were straight out a frozen package. I tried the corn beef hash. Not bad, not great. Sides of pancakes were huge and the French toast looked good.   Portion sizes were smallish for this kind of restaurant.   The service was awful. 10min to get drinks and 35min for food. It wasn't even crowded like when we saw it over the weekend.   You can do better than this. Drive on."}
{"text":"This is our weekend get away from the kids!  ALWAYS GREAT FOOD AND EVEN BETTER PEOPLE AND SERVICE!!  There are always HUGE servings and you never leave hungry.  Great small town feel just when you need it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Service. Recommend to anyone new to the west valley. The cheese cake will be your favorite"}
{"text":"One of the most important things in life is a great breakfast place.  TJ's has everything I look for.  Be aware, it is not classy or swanky...it is old fashioned diner goodness.  The first sign that it was good was the staff.  A good diner will have career waitresses.  They have been doing it for years and they LOVE what they do.  None of these \"I'm too good to serve your\" college students.  Typically in a great diner they will call you sweetheart or dear or some other endearing term.  There isn't egg beaters or vegan options on the menu.  They cook with butter and their biscuits probably have lard in them.  Go to the east side if you want a yuppy trendy breakfast but if you want to experience the way a breakfast diner SHOULD be, go to TJ's.  The service was perfect and the food was great.  This will be our breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good so bad. I love finding those family run diners/restaurants that are a perfect go to or the place you take guests from out of state. Err wrong. Not good at all. My husband and I actually felt very sick after. The cleanliness is questionable. The older lady at the counter seemed pretty cranky. However, the servers were very nice and sociable!"}
{"text":"I liked it more than the dude did, but in the land of chains that the west valley is, it was very nice to find a mom and pop.  I got the chicken fried steak, eggs, and biscuits and gravy. The portion of b and g is enormous! I thought the plate she brought out was for us to share, nope she came back with another. Next time, I think we could split the one side of b and g and pick a different side. I found it good, not amazing. The dude wanted more sausage in his gravy."}
{"text":"Had heard this place was fantastic so I gave it a try.  Got there mid-morning on a weekday.  Place was packed but I got a seat at the counter right away, right in front of the kitchen area.  Not the best place to sit but interesting to watch the cooks work.  Service was slow overall.  Waitress was okay but not exceptional.  She did keep my coffee cup filled.  Lots of items on the menu which made it hard to decide.  I got an omelet with hash browns and toast.  Definitely NOT large portions as I had heard.  Very small portion of hash browns and the omelet was small and bland with canned mushrooms!  Probably why the prices seem reasonable.  You get what you pay for.  Considering the long wait to get food, mediocre quality, small portions I don't see any reason to go back.  Hate to say it but Village Inn is much better."}
{"text":"Tried out this place for the first time the other day it was great 3 adults are for $25 not bad at all will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great food! Homemade food! The service has never been exceptional, but is at the very least considered good. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable. Their homemade pies are to die for! I also recommend getting one of their homemade cinnamon rolls for breakfast. They're huge!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times with my hubby who is a huge fan of this place. EVERYTIME I've gone my food comes to the table cold. The coffee was cold, the french toast was cold etc. I'm not a pain in the butt kinda person but this is crazy. I like my food hot, and they just don't know how to do that (at least when I've been there). The wait staff is wonderful. They are very friendly and when I've told them my food was cold they took it back with a smile and return it to me quickly. I like the food. It's just ok, nothing special..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have usually ordered the same meal. The last time I went in the order was terrible nothing like the times before. I took one bite and told the waitress I wasn't eating this.  She spoke with the owner who was sitting near by and he said, get him something else. I said I didn't want anything else and I would gladly pay for my coffee and toast. She said I had to pay for the breakfast I didn't eat.  I asked for my check I was handed the wrong check then I finally got my check.  I commented I shouldn't have to pay for that meal since it wasn't suitable to eat and the owner told the waitress to charge me for the coffee and toast.  She messed it up and he had to fix it. Or so I thought.  I got charged for both. The owner was rude and waitress had no clue. The wait staff never impressed me and the food is so so.  But after that ordeal never again."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and never been too impressed.  Always been just okay.  And we live close.  Last visit we ordered meat loaf dinner which was mushy & falling apart (not in a good way) buried in gravy.  We also ordered their version of a french dip.  Warning DO NOT ORDER THIS.  The meat was inedible.  Tough, cold and chewy.  Embarrassing.  Should be taken off the menu.  Had two bites of sandwhich.  Wanted a piece of chocolate pie to go and waited 20 minutes to pay the bill and get the pie.  Would have left without pie but still had to pay the bill.  They said they needed to cut the pie.  Not sure that is a 20 minute process.  Starting to not consider this place as there is a growing list of things that are not good at all here.  Too bad cuz we live close and don't cook"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's the local go-to spot for breakfast. They not only serve breakfast but also have a lunch menu and a dinner menu as well. Definitely my favorite American restaurant."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of french toast before TJ's! Now, when I go I always get some! The staff is kind and even though I've only been helped by Manny once, the day he did help me he definitely brightened up my Sunday."}
{"text":"Good country style breakfast. Really enjoyed the biscuit n gravy. The gravy was yummy. The chicken fried steak \"not so much\" the gravy was the only thing saving it in the flavor department. It was thick and chewy too and not crispy as all. The portion sizes were good and the kids really enjoyed breakfast. Found myself picking on everyone else's plate since my steak was a flop. Will def be back, just not for the chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and staff. Not impressed with the biscuits or the gravy; bland. Coffee needs improvement."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here! Home style breakfast and so down-to-earth peeps. Their baked goods are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast served all day long.  Come early or be caught up in a line for up to an hour.  Food quality is good, not great.  Your dollar goes a long way in there as most meals you will not be able to finish.  B&G are always a favorite.  The place could double in size and I think there would still be a line on the weekends.  Definitely a local, elderly favorite...."}
{"text":"Let me start with food is great and super affordable.  Their biscuits and gravy are the best in town. My favorite dishes are the grits with butter and brown sugar and the cinnamon roll French toast.  The service is ok. Waiters aren't the most polite and u can tell they hate it when u try to change something on your order.  Food takes a while to come but they cook your meals as you order them. We can keep coming here because the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"We finally made our 1st visit to TJ's and sorry it had been so long since we made our visit.  Very good food, comes pretty quickly, good portions with a side of attitude from your server (your attitude may vary).  They are only open for Breakfast & Lunch and is certainly with a visit.  You can tell there are many regulars that visit and enjoy TJ's and we will become one of those regulars as well!"}
{"text":"We love TJ's.  They often have a wait time, but it is well worth it!  I think everything is made from scratch, it definitely tastes like it.  We love the breakfast and lunch options, haven't ever been for dinner.  It is a small place, but very friendly, you can tell there are a lot of regulars.  I recently took a friend who has lived in the area for his entire life and he was saying that this is his new breakfast spot, it took first place over his favorite \"go-to\" (he is also a chef). He said he couldn't believe how many times he's passed the place and never went, he was kicking himself a bit, lol.  My favorites are the bacon avocado omelet with hollandaise sauce and the biscuits and gravy (with sausage).  Their burgers are huge and come with your choice of fries or tater tots. I do wish they'd have a better ketchup on hand like Heinz, but that is about the only no-so-great thing that I can say dining there.   Go here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and found this great place! Very satisfied with food, great portions and real homemade food. The biscuits and gravy are delicious"}
{"text":"I love these little spots. But this one is bigger than it seems. And the portions are HUGE for a small price. Can't wait to try it again, for lunch this time."}
{"text":"Great place to have Breakfast.  Its been around for ages and has that small town diner feel.  The food is always good I have always had great service.  It isn't fancy but clean and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast here once. It was OK.  You really can't go wrong with breakfast but just wasn't impressed. From what I hear the fish frys are one of the best in town for dinner time . Looks like I will be visiting this place soon to give a dinner review."}
{"text":"We love TJs. Great ppl.  Great food.  Great atmosphere. Great service. Great prices.  Great portions."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times the place was packed. Food is great and a lot of it. Great home style food at a good price."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that opens for breakfast and lunch. It gets very busy with folks waiting to get in.   I am not a waiting kind of guy so I stopped in once when I saw that there were no folks lined up. I was seated right away and served right away.  The food is pretty average if you ask me, nothing bad nor really good.  It is A-OK for basic fare. But you will not find me waiting to get in."}
{"text":"Yes it was a Sunday and yes it was a wait but a hour and still no food. Got up and left."}
{"text":"This place is a treat! Every time someone comes to visit, this is the place we take them. We used to go before they expanded, and it was well worth the wait! Now they get you in quick and easy, and the food is delicious! To be fair though, we've only eaten there for breakfast, we definitely need to try other meals."}
{"text":"This is a do again.. As always the lot was full but in all fairness, it's not that a large lot. Walked in and was seated right away and our waitress was very nice, good personality and attentive. The food as always was good. We ordered a Pancake combo and one of the special's they were offering today (Chile over hash browns with two eggs."}
{"text":"The owner is a straight ASSHOLE. No other way to put it. We couldn't get anyone to service us but when we walked out without eating or paying we had damn near 10people follow us outside  after a half hour with no straws and watery drinks, we got our food which 2 out of 3 plates were wrong! Then we were called \"hard to please'' for expecting our food the way we ordered it! Hahaha what a joke. AND they had a little girl bussing/waiting tables! Couldn't have been older than11/12 years old! Wtf?! And the gravy omg it was a curdled mess, and the owner argued with me that it wasn't, even though I have been eating there since I was in my mother's womb and always got the biscuits and gravy! Its almost comical to me how mad he got when I said it was separated and curdled this place is a hit or miss, but this is the last time I'm gonna let them serve me shit and get mad at me for asking them to fix their mistakes... Or asking for a straw, for Christ's sake!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try TJs today after driving past a couple of times and hearing about it a few more times.  We got there about 11:30 on a Saturday and had to wait about 10 mins for a table.  Not that bad.  We ordered the meatloaf sandwich and the hot beef sandwich.  The food came and it was open faced on homemade bread smothered in gravy and mashed potatoes.  The taters were buttery with the right amount of lumps in it.  The meatloaf was definitely homemade, moist, and flavorful.  The hot beef was good.  I personally thought it could have used a little more seasoning. The bread was soft and airy.  We also bought a french silk pie to take home.  It weighed like 3 lbs when we picked it up lol.    Now the prices here were actually cheaper than we expected.  The place was busy and the staff was busy.  The service was friendly and with the amount of running around it is understandable that refills were a little slow and it took a bit longer to get our food than  other restaurants.    Paying for the meal was unorthodox.  You have to go into the waiting area to pay and they come back through to leave.  When we were paying there wasn't anyone waiting but a line formed behind us to pay.  The little old lady behind the counter they called Mom.  She was nice, but not quick lol.  So we had to navigate past the line to make our way to the door when we were finished paying.  We would come back again for this.  It really is just a down home place with comfort food.  Do not expect to pop in for a quick meal.  The waitress did say when the snowbirds come back into town it is not uncommon for a 45 min or longer wait and 45 mins to get food after you do order."}
{"text":"For a mom and pops place its pretty good. The french toast is fluffy and tasty.  The waitress was friendly and made sure everything was good."}
{"text":"Good, not amazing. We passed this place one because there was a 45 minute wait. So we figured Tuesday morning sounded doable. Passed on our normal spot at my husband utter disdain. I assured him it would be worth it.   I ordered the chicken fried steak, and discovered there was no chicken fried steak to be found. I quickly tried to decide on something else while sitting in awkward silence having the waitress standing pen in hand watching. I hate this. I'm super indecisive when I eat or because I want to try everything and it's a mental checks and balances to decide what I want. Yes, my problem, but just ask if you should come back in a couple minutes.  Anyway. I ordered the farmers breakfast and my husband got the corned beef hash.  Coffee was hot. Food came out fast. Mine was a good portion size, husband's...not so much. Brought out one strawberry jelly packet for all of his toast. Corned beef hash was ok. Nothing special. The farmers breakfast was delicious, and worth eating again. Somehow our ticket was 30.xx bucks, and I wish I would have looked at the ticket before paying because they took it and I can't look back. I was pretty sure both out entrees were 8.75 so... I'm not sure if coffee is really expensive or they charge a resort fee... Anyway. Not badmouthing. My breakfast was great, but when I look at places known for big second, great process, and excellent food, I kinda expect that. We will probably eat hers if we are In the area, but won't go out of our way to stop here."}
{"text":"The service and food were excellent. There were 5 of us for breakfast and they got us right in, even though they were really busy. We would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. Quality is just not there for me. The very better Hong about this place is the giant 3$ cinnamon rolls. Service is sub par"}
{"text":"Initial perception was not good, the elder lady that sat us was rude. I had to get my own high chair. The building is old and the inside is very dirty and dated.   Although the place was packed and the food came out a in a reasonable amount of time, it was warm except for my sausage links which were cold. When I mentioned they were cold the waitress did take them back. I was expecting to get some new fresh/hot sausage, but to my surprise I just got the same ones that were microwaved.   The only good thing about this place was our waitress, she was very friendly, but other than that do now waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch in a great Mom and Pop location. On the weekend be prepared to wait but always worth it.  The cinnamon buns are enormous and the portions are generous. The Farmers Breakfast is one of my favorite dishes here."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I have ever had. Eggs were almost raw. Biscuits were inedible. My wife had the chicken fried steak and took one bite and spit it out."}
{"text":"I really appreciate them staying open just for me when they were about to close!!! Food is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I love TJs!   The food's good, prices are good, service is even better.  They're always friendly when we're there and we always leave full.   The only thing I can think of as a negative would be that they close at 2pm or maybe before. However, on Fridays, they're open til' 8pm."}
{"text":"Good ol' home cookin' and big portions. Don't expect fast food, this stuff is made by family and they might take their time, but oh so worth it. It's not pricey at all, a great bargain, super friendly staff. Ample parking even during busy times, though beware of motocity next door they don't take well to restaurant people using up all their parking (for good reason!)   If you want desert items or just crave something sweet, the giant size cinnamon rolls or little chocolate cream pie things (sorry, don't know the word...) are super tasty. I always leave satisfied. Only drawback is coffee could be a bit better, though I will take a wild guess they make it 80% good so people don't just linger all day and take up the tables while others who want to have a meal wait for a seat...   Tip from the regulars: Look at the board as you walk-in, good specials not on the menu!"}
{"text":"I can't believe all these ppl are talking abt this being a \"Mom and Pop\" place. It's a CHAIN, folks! The food is good reliable comfort food fare .. my pancakes were very good. I waited 30 mins for them so it's a good thing they were so tasty. They were very busy. We went on Sunday for lunch. I'm sure we'll go back. Im just giving them three *s bc I think 30 minute wait for a short stack is a little ridiculous. Hopefully they can redeem themselves next time."}
{"text":"My dad brought me here.  Cool diner atmosphere.  Great food, fun staff.  Get the western omelet if you are doing keto.  Prices aren't too bad. Place is super busy."}
{"text":"There servings are hearty there food is AWESOME. The ambiance is nice feels like home, the staff is super friendly. Defenetly  a must"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 16 years, but since the expansion the customer service is getting worse.  Ordered a burger steak medium-rare, eggs over easy.  Burger steak dry and well done.  Mention it to the staff and all they say is \"gee, sorry, here's your bill\".  Seems like management is getting burnt out since trying to incorporate baking pies and cakes into their expansion of the restaurant.  What's missing most is the consistent quality of food coming out of the kitchen.  Used to almost never happen, but seems like now we expect it and usually aren't surprised when something is off.  Only now, no one really cares.  We may try Black Bear up the street as we've heard for a long time they are also good."}
{"text":"Home style is the name of this game and they are sooooooo goooooooood. You must try the broasted chicken on sundays :) literally have been thinking about this place since I left."}
{"text":"Just witnessed the manager/owner who looked liked he just rolled out of bed yelled at 3 of his servers in plain view of the customers. Very unprofessional. Food is good but service is slowwww."}
{"text":"Food was incredible! That cinnamon roll was to die for. Chicken fried steak, wow! I seriously cannot wait to go back. I'm dreaming of the food already."}
{"text":"We visited TJ's yesterday and I don't think we will be back. Our waitress was not very attentive to start with. We had a party of 3 (myself, husband, & son)and only received 2 silverware sets. Our drinks were never once refilled. We order 2 big breakfast and an order of pancakes. Our pancakes were forgotten and by the time we got them it was time to go. We never received our 3rd silverware set so I ended up trying to eat with a spoon and that was difficult when trying to cut stuff. We also orders a \"giant\" cinnamon roll, which honestly wasn't that big, and it was literally drowning in whatever the sauce was. It was really tough to chew. The food itself wasn't all that great either. My toast was literally burnt, the ham was also burnt. The sausage was good though. And to think for what we ordered it was way overpriced, our bill was $50. Had the food and service been even mediocre I wouldn't complain about the price. I don't recommend this restaurant at all! So many better breakfast or brunch options nearby. And to top it off the staff (including the manager) was more concerned about a guest they knew that was sitting in the booth behind us. They were so loud talking about a court case the guy was dealing with and how he was going to be extradited and basically the entire case was discussed. Sorry to say but this mom and pop restaurant is just a no go!"}
{"text":"The waitresses are old school bitchy but not in a good way. If they were slowly more pleasant it would be a five but the food is amazing we have been about 13 times. Farmers breakfast and biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast this past Friday morning.  I have always loved, loved this place.  One of the items we ordered was biscuits and gravy.  It tasted worse than wallpaper paste.  I think they have been using their coffee grinds several times instead of using fresh each time.  The walls had food splatters.  The old swinging door in the backroom is filthy.  I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience a couple months ago and decided to give it one more shot this morning, it didn't pay off. Unfortunately we have ate here for the final time. Every time the food and service have gotten worse and worse.   We waited over 10 min to be asked what we wanted to drink, our food came fast but my boyfriend's omlet looked like it was only made with two eggs, not the three eggs they claimed. It was very tiny and the only thing on the extra large plate (the pancakes were served separately).   My omlet was equally as small and I was disgusted by the fact the mushrooms were from a can!! They never brought my toast, I would have asked for it had the server have came and asked how our food was prior grabbing our plates and dropping off the check.   I wish I could say this was a fluke but it's happened multiple times. If you want a great breakfast place, go to Black Bear Diner, you will NOT be let down like you would be here!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the fuss is all about.  Scrambled eggs have no flavor,  ham is tough and has hard bits, grits are bland. They DO know how to make over easy and poached eggs though, although most of the white is missing from the poached."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the worst food and service I have ever had. All of the other breakfast places around were long waits so we checked yelp and although it was a risky at 3.5, there was no wait and everyone was hungry. I wasn't expecting a lot given the 3.5 star rating but sometimes I've found the more ratings taken can be more important than the rating in Yelp.  Ordered the huge cinnamon roll, chicken fried steak and apple juice.  Apple juice tasted spoiled, told the waitress and her response was a pissed off look then asked \"Well what else do you want then?\" (With this start we considered canceling the order and just leaving but we were hungry and unfamiliar with the area so how bad could breakfast be done...BAD as we found out!) Cinnamon roll actually tasted decent after I removed the 2 cups of thick icing plopped on top of the roll. Chicken fried steak was simply nasty. Gravy was gross and like the icing on the cinnamon roll was 2 cups of thick bland corn starch filled gravy plopped on the nasty fried steak. Like I mentioned earlier I was hungry so I tried to force it down. I tried salt, pepper and even tried masking the nastiness with tobacco and finally have to give up.  Eggs 'over easy' were soupy more like sunny side up so it was just bad.   My wife had French toast and again I would describe the disappointment but you get the point. NOTHING was good except for the lady as we walked out gave the kids a dum dum sucker, which sums up my visit. I was a dum dum for paying and only a sucker would return."}
{"text":"dont bother, i had a omelette, no bigger than my hand, i'm female so my hand is small, they looked like scrambled folded over. the pancakes tasted like they were military issue for the battle field, ate 1/4. all for a price of 10.00."}
{"text":"My parents recommended this place to me so I figured since it's close to my home I will give it a try.   Place was pretty busy when we arrived around 7pm on a Friday night. Thankfully there is a sign for parking behind the building otherwise we wouldn't have found a spot.   Its a cute little rustic diner and we were sat at a booth for my family of 4. They were pretty busy for this small restaurant and the server we had wasn't quick with her speed either.   All in all the food was really good. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh and exactly how we were wanting it.   So food for a family of four with drinks and dessert cost me $60.00 not including the tip....."}
{"text":"We have eaten there many times  many times in past the food was good   not great but ok .   This last time  Friday December 4th 2015  We went to the restaurant because Black Bear Restaurant on I-10 and Dysart was closed for remodeling so I  drove to TJ' restaurant on Dysart Rd in Avondale we asked for 3 orders of all the fish        which means u should just get a couple of extra pieces but what we  received was far from being nice and when we got the fish plates home it the worst fish I have seen there were small pieces which looked like the pieces were  left in the deep fryer to long or were under heat lamp to long  We will never go to TJ'S restaurant again  the meals was a  complete disaster, Cole slaw had big pieces of cabbage, the potato salad was very bland. The worst part was their were not busy according to my wife the restaurant had very few people at 5PM on a Friday night  To me the quality of the food and the service has gone way down if I had to give them a score it would be a two at the most Many years ago this is a great place to eat so I don't know what happened I feel the owner needs to get out of the business and give it to someone else or sell it to someone else if i remember right the owner is also the manager and he is very rude never again"}
{"text":"The owners are great. They always know you by name and take care of you. The food is always plentiful and amazing. I HIGHLY recommend coming in for breakfast."}
{"text":"They have expanded the restaurant about 2 years ago so wait time isn't long.  We love coming here for the homemade cinnamon roll! Check out my photos.  The energy here is pretty much country.  The decor reminds me of grandmas house in Texas. The food is pretty good and the waitstaff will top your coffee off regularly."}
{"text":"After reading all the great and good reviews, had to try this place. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. I thought it was just ok. Ok food, Ok service, Ok ambience. The food at Denny's, IHOP are about the same. I would give this place an average rating at best."}
{"text":"The food is always really good. Everything is homemade from scratch. Portions are large and prices are reasonable. Best breakfast spot in the west valley."}
{"text":"The place has been in the same spot for 34 years. Memorabilia all over the place, some of it pretty funny. Went on Saturday morning for breakfast. Quite a mix of patrons. Large menu with numerous pages. Got a regular breakfast with home made raisin bread toast. Nothing special with the eggs and potatoes (how much can you do with it). My son got an omelette, he said it was kind of bland. From what I could see, and by the mix of patrons, a mix but mostly older, I assume the food is made for a more moderate taste. Interesting place because of the history but seems like just another breakfast place. Although I must say the raisin bread was very good and I imagine the homemade pies are probably the star of this place. I will go back and try a pie, but breakfast, I can have anywhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a definite five star! Delicious food is homemade. Our server Belinda was excellent! The ham steak undr $10 is giant and delic, about 1/2\" thick. All the breakfast trimmings make it a delightful experience. We stop here every time we r near."}
{"text":"Simply Tasty Breakfast... Once again delicious coffee, crispy bacon, awesome fresh biscuits, perfectly cooked hash browns. Simply the best. If its homemade it's Tj's.."}
{"text":"This star is for Thomas the bus boy. I came to this place real excited about trying a local restaurant that I haven't been to. I'm really disappointed. First of all our server was rude and had a horrible attitude from the beginning. Now I would of understood if we where mean to her or jerks but that was not the case she came to use already in mood. Second one of us went to the restroom and found that the bathroom pipes were all exposed. Third when we finally got our food on the table, 45 minutes later, one of us was missing our plate come to find out the server never wrote his order. Then to top that off we found out that the ketchup that we all put on our food was expired when we told the waitress about this we asked if we could have ketchup packets she said there wasn't any well another waitress over heard and said that they did and that they have been having complaints about the ketchup. So why would you put that ketchup out in the first place? Anyways we ended up talking to the manger before we left and these were his exact words \"what do you want me to do about it\" I will never go back to this place and I hope this never happens to anyone else."}
{"text":"Been here many times and every time everyone is super kind and nice. The food is spectacular the staff is very family friendly! Definite recommended!"}
{"text":"I think the pictures look better than the food tastes. Don't get me wrong it was not bad at all, but also not what I expected. I thought the grits would be thicker and the gravy was a bit cold, but all still pretty good. Really nice staff, provided quick and efficient service. Overall 3 stars"}
{"text":"Please keep in mind I only had pie from here recently and it was a gift. You will never know life without this peanut butter pie people. I am dead serious so so so soooooooo amazing!!!! I can't even begin to explain how good this pie was but EVERYONE loved it this weekend all I know is that I now need one just for myself ya'll can get your own I will definitely be picking one up regularly!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Club  On more then one occasions  I have driven by TJ's Homestyle Restaurant and asked myself, why are all these people waiting around for some hole-in-the-wall restaurant, could the food be that good?  Well, today I decided to find out for myself.  Don't expect anything fancy at TJ's. This is a down home, comfort food type of restaurant. In fact, TJ'S Homestyle comfort food is so popular that you'll most likely have to wait for a table, but it's well worth the wait.  The menu has many options from pancakes, omelets, biscuits & gravy, pastries, breakfast sandwiches and everything in between. It was so hard to choose.  Today, I tried the French Toast Combo. Two huge pieces of French Toast, 2 eggs, and 2 slices of bacon. The  French toast is made with homemade French Bread and it's delicious.  This French Toast is thick, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and oh so satisfying. You will be filled with just one slice but it is so good you will eat two.   TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch so don't make dinner plans. However,  if you want a great Breakfast, at a great price, and value great customer service then make this hole-in-the-wall part of your breakfast club."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Huge portions, service that treats you like family.  Try the biscuits and gravy.  French toast is made with great french bread.  Saturday is busy but the wait wasn't to long."}
{"text":"Down home, locally owned, family restaurant.  Great for breakfast and lunch! More seating and a more open feel since their new remodel and now they have room for a full bakery!   Food is very good with generous portions. Bacon and sausage are wonderful here and the kids love the pancakes.   It isn't fancy, but it's clean and everyone is friendly. Same people have worked here for as long as I have been coming.  Crowded for weekend breakfast so be prepared to wait - it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place made a pretty average burrito but the spicy salsa made the wet burrito. The service was good minus the fact that they failed to make adjustments to my two friends breakfast. Overall, a good, quick eat."}
{"text":"Great biscuits and gravy! Itty bitty place, great home like feeling, but expect a wait."}
{"text":"Awesome as always! Friendly, family environment. Service is always spot on and never a complaint about my meal."}
{"text":"My Parents and I in addition to my sisters and their families are regulars here. Breakfast is great. Service has gone downhill as time has passed. 40 minutes for our food to come out. My Veteran Husband ordered a mushroom cheese burger which was ordered \"medium\". It came out dry and overdone. He didn't take more than 2 bites. Asked to have it taken off the menu. The cook/manager came out hot. We politely stated our issue and the food was taken away. Asked if he could help a Vet out. The response was: \"So what? I don't care your a Vet!\" WOW! I asked if he was a proud of his response. He outright said: \"Yes! Who cares what you say!\" They've definitely lost our service. I was appalled at the hostility with raised voices. Breakfast is great. Lunch was dry and overdone. Needless to say: They are not friendly Proud Patriots."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here the other day for the first time and I have to say I was impressed. The food was wonderful and lots of it. The service was great and its not unreasonably priced. I will definitely drive the 20miles to eat here again."}
{"text":"Um, no thank you. Breakfast was cheap $14 for two people, but waited 30min to be seated and another 30 -for food. Had absolutely no flavor at all. Diced potatoes plain, and veggie omelette no flavor either. Service was good, food wasn't. I guess you get what you pay for. Bakery however is very good. The cinnamon roll was so good."}
{"text":"This is a great place, the food is excellent and the service is great.  Sometimes there is a wait to get in, but well worth it!  Watch out if you park in the front lot, if you park in the spots marked with the signs for the motorcycle shop next to the restaurant, you will get towed, so pay attention to the signs."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The cinnamon rolls are insane don't leave without getting one! I had a breakfast sandwich and the Mr. Had eggs bacon and potatoes. We shared a cinnamon roll and the bill was $17. I will be going the next time I'm in the area! Skip Denny's and ihop and go to TJ's"}
{"text":"Very cozy restaurant very busy during the weekend get there early. Food is very good and everything tastes homemade."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service! Our first time here and it was a wonderful experience. The food is phenomenal and the homemade from scratch raisin bread and dessert  are a must. The price is ridiculously cheap. For breakfast for two including drinks and dessert to go, it only came out to $22! For the quality of food and service at other restaurants the bill would've been $40 for the same exact stuff but of course not as good :-)"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since stopping by TJ's, but the food and prices are as good as ever. On top of that, the restaurant has had some remodeling that has really made a positive improvement.  Service today was very good and attentive. For dinner, the family had the super cheap ($2.69)but huge cinnamon roll to start and finished with the Spanish omelet, biscuits and gravy, and the meat lovers scramble.  All were very tasty and satisfied that home cooking craving. Only complaint was the cinnamon roll was a little overcooked.  Overall though, a good time and good meal."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food , nothing spectacular , but nothing bad about the place. I've had better , and I've had worse"}
{"text":"Came here the morning after seeing Metallica. We got seated quickly and our waitress was quick with the drinks food and check. Which was nice because we needed to hit the road back to Tucson. Glad we found this place definitely will be coming back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Ok I know I just posted a good review for TJ's, but really? Where shall I start today? First off it was busy like it always is, no problem. It took over 5 minutes to get a drink order. Again, no problem....  I ordered the country fried steak and eggs I wanted my eggs scrambled well with cheese and I got a side of biscuits and gravy. My son also ordered the same thing his eggs scrambled as well but he got hashbrowns and sourdough toast. Our order went into the kitchen at 10:35 AM and our order came out at 11:11 AM it took forever to get our order. Once I got my breakfast I noticed my eggs were still runny, but scrambled and there was no cheese like I ordered so I sent them back. I start to eat my chicken fried steak and after eating a few bites I notice it raw in the middle and I mean raw. I pushed my plate away and said I am done! My sons eggs were also runny and they forgot his toast which has happened in the past. We didn't ask for it because we knew it would take a while to get that too. This was the most disappointing meal I have ever had a TJ's. It will be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"best breakfast, great prices, nice people, can be packed at main breakfast times. crazy cinnabun things. but best breakfast in avondale for sure!"}
{"text":"How could you not give this a five star?  The place is a \"dive\" ma and pa breakfast diner. The staff were super attentive and nice. Also they all look out for everyone in the restaurant....not just their own tables which was nice.   We sat at the bar. I like sitting at the bar at diners. That's where the action is! The food was good.  We had the avocado omelet with hollandaise sauce and the eggs bene Neither of which were life changing but they were solid good and very good size portions.  We are STUFFED and very happy Thank you all!"}
{"text":"This is unbelievably good, locally owned, not chain restaurant. I live right down the street and passed it 100 times before my roommate insisted we go there for breakfast. When I eat there it feels like I just had a meal cooked by grandma. A huge delicious portion of whatever you want is waiting at this restaurant. If you don't get a giant cinnamon roll while you're there you must go back."}
{"text":"First off I am a person that always gives great reviews and won't bash a place. But this place takes the icing off the cake the chicken was fried three times over hard and dried out. The all you can eat fish, we asked for catfish and tricked us and brought cod out. Then when it was time for seconds she said \"oh we're out of catfish\" I was like what did you give us? she said awwww the tried to trick you with the cod. We got up and left all the food there including the want to be catfish. The manager yelled across the room and said what do you want me to do for you? Serious dude no customer service. Never going back I'll stick with lolo's chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"TJ'S what can I say I'm a sucker for country style cooking. I eat the cordon on bleu sandwich and it was huge and tasteful. I also got an order of their famous chicken noodle soup that tasted like chicken and dumplings. It was delicious. The waitress was pleasant and attentive. Definitely will be back and will share my review with others."}
{"text":"One of my customers moved from El Mirage to Goodyear so I now find myself in this part of the valley early on a regular basis. So I Yelped \"breakfast in Goodyear\" and this came up. Even though it was just past 6AM it was hard to find a parking spot on a Tuesday. Fortunately it wasn't that packed inside and I was told to pick a seat. Coffee showed up almost instantly and the corned beef hash not far behind. There is a placard on the table with some of the history of the place. The cash register is sort of hidden in the middle and it helps to read the over head signs. Nothing exciting about the place but it is good solid food and I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Heard many rave about this place,thought i give it a try. The staff was pleasant,they gave you that \"hey friend haven't seen you for spell greeting\"( small town charm), the restaurant it self is clean and gives off the small town diner feel to it. The food probably could be better,had to use my knife to cut the pancakes(not sure if thats normal though), my scrambled eggs were a bit running(i had worse though elsewhere).I read about how the owner was rude to his staff,i got the  friendly camaraderie between boss and his staff,sort of like the show in the 1980's show Alice, i guess some people work in stiff environment and need to lighten up. I may give them an other try down the road."}
{"text":"Came here after hiking and was straving...  We had to put our name on the list but the wait was only 5 mins.  The server right away came and took our drink order.  Had to get the ice tea, I needed to cool off from the hike.    Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak (I know it defeats the purpose of my hike)....but it sounds so good.  And then it tasted so good...  The steak was pan fried and a light coating.  The country gravy on it was heavenly and the hash brown were da BOMB.  I also got sourdough toast to soak up the country gravy.    The food and service was excellent....  =)  Love this little old diner."}
{"text":"We have lived in Avondale for 13 years and decided to give TJs a try after church on Easter. I regret not going there earlier. The wait was minimal and the service was good. The food is AMAZING! We had to make a return trip already. The cinnamon roll is a must try! A++"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic local country style breakfast spot. Start with the go are cinnamon roll with some coffee. The biscuits and gravy are creamy and fresh. Sausages are local and very good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Goodyear.  Sausage links are great.  Biscuits and gravy are very good and huge portion.  Speaking of huge, have a cinnamon role as big as a plate and buy a pie to take home.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good foo good service. The place is always busy, so that's a great sign. Not the best breakfast place I have been to but I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Host was rude and we had a long wait to be seated.  Once seated we got the wham-bam-thank you service.  Food was good, nice portions.  Interior could use a face lift.  Overall Meh!"}
{"text":"This was my second time experiencing T.J.'s and it doesn't disappoint.  The rating is for succeeding at serving LARGE meals and tasty ones at that.  This is a traditional diner with kitschy country interiors and good service.  My teenage son loves the biscuits and gravy and the whole serving fills the plate.  The sausage was noticeable in the gravy, no skimping here!  Another in our party had the chicken strips and they were hot and crispy, but the meat inside was moist.  I had an omelette and it was as advertised and the side of pancakes were fluffy and perfect.  My husband enjoyed his chicken fried steak.  Don't forget to get a cinnamon roll appetizer!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast spot! Nice people and great service! Carrie is awesome! A definite place to go for a good ole country style, home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Absolute favorite diner! If they had bloody Mary's or mimosas they'd never get me out of there! Popular local spot, great portions, sassy staff and yummy food! Moved out of town but when I return I always make it a point to come here! Still feels like home to me!"}
{"text":"Greatest home cooking...!! Very rare you find a place like this... The best biscuits and gravy this side of the Mississippi.. Everything from scratch and The portions are huge. The prices.. let just say your NOT going to break the bank.. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price and great staff. Worth the 25 min drive for breakfast.  Will be busy during spring training"}
{"text":"Great steak n eggs! All I've needed."}
{"text":"The food is great! The only downfall to this place is that they are understaffed for the business they get...oh and our waitress was less than pleasant. The wait time for everything was insane! 20 min wait to be seated, 20/25 wait time for the food after it was ordered, 10 min wait to get an extra plate, and 10+ wait time for the check when done. All in all we were there for 2 hours. Even though the food was awesome we wont be going there ever again!"}
{"text":"Great home style breakfast on the way to Indians spring training game in Goodyear. It was packed on Sunday morning, but we didn't wait that long - and our omelets and perfect crispy hash browns were worth every minute. We left too stuffed to take a pie to go, but they sure looked good! It appeared that there were lots of regulars, which is always a good sign. Thanks, YELP for saving us from boring Denny's."}
{"text":"Found hair in my food, waited forever to get a new plate. When bill arrived I took it to the manager and asked if that meal could be removed. He walks away without saying a word and returns with another guy and they both start cussing at me in front of my 2 year old grandson and said they were calling the cops if I didn't pay. I said I shouldn't pay for a meal that was delivered with a hair in it & that I will be contacting the health department. Both men then got in my face and told me to leave, as I'm leaving and scared to death of these two, the male kitchen staff also came out calling me a stupid bitch, made it to my car and got the hell out of there. Weirdest and scariest restaurant experience of my life, stay away from this place!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  It is a nice mom and pop place with huge serving sizes and a friendly staff.  Corned beef hash is so yummy and the farmers breakfast can cure any hangover.  It is the perfect Sunday morning breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for a few years now. It's the perfect spot for breakfast and lunch. Food is always hot coming out and waitresses are the best. They make everything just the way you like it. Homestyle cooking at its finest. Plus, they have pies! Coffee is great too! Family Friendly. Our goal is to make it to the Fish Fry they typically have on Fridays.  This is definitely our go to place. Wish I had food pics to post, but as fast as it comes out, is as fast as its gone! There are long lines generally on the weekends, but since their remodel/expansion, the wait isn't bad. Even if it was, we don't mind waiting. Best breakfast place ever. Very affordable."}
{"text":"I've only been in Az. for a few months now but this was the worst excuse for breakfast I have ever had  in life. I waited 20 minutes for  veg.omelete that was maybe an egg and a half.And the hash browns were not even cooked! They were just thawed out and warmed enough to put them on the plate.I will never come back and I wouldn't recommend this place to a starving man.Almost forgot the toast was made 4 hours ago.$ 12.00 WASTED"}
{"text":"Quality is certainly not what it was last year.  Runny eggs, burnt hash browns, and salty gravy.  Don needs to retire.  He is short with customers, gossipy, and just plain rude.  We have frequented this restaurant on a bi-weekly basis for seven years.  No more.  I refuse to eat in a place that is hostile.  I am not even going to mention the recent episode where Don berated a special needs family.  Shocking!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always delicious and freshly made. Our whole family comes here, it's really the best place for breakfast. Also their baked goods are outstanding."}
{"text":"Location is very clean and the staff is super friendly! Omelette was decent, good coffee, this beats the heck out of chain restaurant food."}
{"text":"Bonkers portion sizes and good coffee. We went for breakfast yesterday; our group included a toddler who is in a throwing phase, and the servers were patient and friendly. They were packed and so it took a little long to get our food, but not overly so. In any event, the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We left here happy and full! The food is well made and the server we had was attentive.. she EARNED her tip! My uncle is a regular. #HappyCustomers"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews and location, we decided to give this place a try. My son And I ordered the steak and eggs. My son judges breakfast spots based on their hot chocolate. He gave them an 8/10 for the hot chocolate. Our steaks were served medium well, as requested, and were seasoned perfectly. The steak and eggs came with hash browns and toast, all for $9! It was well worth it. My son loves the steak (he gives the steak a 10/10), as did I. We also split their gigantic cinnamon roll. It was delicious. We plan on returning frequently."}
{"text":"OMG! The food is great here! Big portions and a cheap price. They make everything from scratch here. The restaurant looks like grandma's kitchen in here.  I love it."}
{"text":"We frequented this restaurant a lot over the past five years. In fact, there was a time we were going every other weekend. Unfortunately that changed yesterday. Since the restaurant was renovated, my husband and I have been there three or four times. I understand that now that they can accommodate many more customers, the service is going to be slower and the stress levels will be higher. However, what happened yesterday was inappropriate, unprofessional and unacceptable. I ordered what I order every single time I go there. My husband did the same. In fact, I joked with the waitress that she should make copies of the ticket so she can just have them ready whenever we come in. After my husband and I placed our orders, the waitress walked away, checked the window for other tables' food. Talked to the other servers. Got my coffee and my husband's soda and snagged some creamer off of another table for me. At that point, I asked if she could change my toast from dry wheat to raisin bread. She informed me that was fine since she hadn't even put the ticket in yet. Um......okay??? This particular server is new and I get that. However, you write the ticket, hang it in the window, then go do other stuff.  After waiting another thirty minutes (again, I get they were busy and I was willing to overlook this) she brought out my eggs, bacon and grits. She told me she was waiting on the bread. My eggs were the consistency of rubber. When she came back over with my husband's plate, I asked her if she could have them remake my eggs as they were overdone. She took the plate, walked over to the kitchen and put my eggs on a separate little dish. She brought the bacon and grits back, along with my husband's food. She went back to the window and retrieved a new plate of eggs for me and brought them back over to me; by which time my husband had pointed out his eggs were not over-medium either, but were still clear where the whites were undercooked. He had taken his eggs and put them on his toast plate for her so she could just take them to the kitchen to be replaced. When she handed the cook that second plate of eggs is when the problem started.  The waitress and another woman I can only assume is the manager stood in front of the window while the cook screamed, yelled and threw things (yes, THREW things) like a two year old child who was told \"No.\" He yelled and screamed about eggs and \"stupid people\" and cooking for a good thirty seconds before my husband went and informed the owner, Don. When my husband and Don walked back, the cook was still screaming and yelling. As Don was walking into the kitchen, we heard a dish crashing and Don yelling at the cook.  While this was going on, the waitress brought me my raisin toast which looked like it had been chewed up and spit out on the plate. Seriously, the presentation was just very poor and by this time, I was just over the whole thing.  A few minutes later, Don emerged from the kitchen with two eggs, cooked over medium. He put them in front of my husband who thanked him. Don told him to \"check them.\" My husband told him they were fine. Don insisted he check them again. So, my husband stuck his fork in them and stated again that they were fine.  Then, the waitress shows Don the plate of raisin bread. She mumbled something and he yelled, \"She ordered raisin bread and....what???!!\" The waitress looked like she was about to cry, so I said, \"It looks like someone chewed it up and spit it out on the plate.\" He took it and went back into the kitchen. By this time, I had just completely lost my appetite. I got the car keys from my husband and went out to the car.  My husband advised that after I left, Don came back out with two new pieces of bread. He advised Don that I had left and Don threw it in the trash and exclaimed, \"I TRIED! I tried to make it right!\"  My husband finished his eggs and was told there was no bill (I should certainly think not!). As he was leaving, Don told him, \"Have a nice life.\" So, here's the thing: If you own a business in the service industry especially, there occasionally will be a complaint. However, you should realize that your customers are your source of income and the reason you even have a business. In the five years I have been going there, I have never once complained about the food...EVER. Yesterday it was completely warranted and I left there feeling as if I were the \"bad guy.\" Well after five years of supporting this local business, I can honestly say I will never be back there. I'm a bit disappointed because it was our favorite place to go for breakfast, but I'm not going to be a patron somewhere that treats their customers as an annoying inconvenience. And, honestly, I would have been okay but not for the fit the cook threw. That is where it all went downhill. They're just eggs. You're not doing brain surgery, dude. Take a valium and chill out.  As for me, I'll be going to Black Bear diner from now on."}
{"text":"I've heard so much of this place, but honestly, I am not a fan, asked about the corned beef hash, first thing my waitress said, \"Well it's canned, but I guess it's decent.\" Coffee tasted as if it was from the day before. Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"I will never come back here. I just witnessed what may be the rudest manager dressing down an employee not only in front of other servers but about 10 patrons as well. The waitress may have been doing something wrong I have no idea but you do not dress down employees in front of customers or patrons for any reason.   The manager then proceeded to ask the other servers after the lady left if he was wrong. Well who the hell would disagree with you for fear of being yelled at.   Also the kitchen is in the weeds and this manager or owner was more worried about going outside to smoke. In the 40 minutes I sat watching he went outside twice.   I was so angry by the time I left I wanted to punch the guy for 45 minutes I had to listen to him yell at people from the cooks to waitresses"}
{"text":"I went for lunch yesterday with my wife and friend. It had been a while since going there. The food was great and the wait staff was excellent also. But I'm probably not going to return after what I saw yesterday that bothered me seeing this. I know the owner and I was very surprised to see him act this way to this young waitress, she did nothing wrong but he yelled at her in front of other customers telling her not to challenge him. He made her cry and hyperventilate.  I felt very bad for her:(. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"If anyone has lived in a small town in the South or Midwest you are used to little diners with mismatched place settings, old farm decor and of course huge servings of good ole country cooking.  Visiting TJ's made me feel like I was in Southern Missouri again, not Phoenix!    Cinnamon roll was huge and sooo good!  Biscuits and gravy were the bomb!  Could use a little more sausage in the gravy but not complaining.  The servings are ginormous too!  I got two full meals out of one order!    The prices are really affordable, especially when you consider the portion sizes!  If you are looking for a trendy new breakfast joint or gourmet food, this is not your place.  If you want a good hearty meal then this is for you!  Just ignore the looks, it's not pretty, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"What the French toast!? This place has very delicious French toast. And the biscuits are flaky. Good spot for a homemade breakfast and good waitresses. I would come back."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I had the ham and eggs and it was very small portions. Service was slow. Food took about 25 minutes to come out. If you want an ok breakfast and have time to spend, this place is ok."}
{"text":"I grew up on the west side. Went to Agua Fria High School. I remember eating at TJ's 25 years ago with my dad on Sunday mornings. When I was working with a west side based company when I was 18 years old, we ate there at least a few times per week for lunch. TJ's was always the mainstay for our breakfast and lunch outings.... Because it was awesome. Well, I met my dad for lunch there yesterday. Very disappointed. Burger was dry and of seemingly poor quality (think frozen patty thrown on a griddle and overcooked), bacon was dry and hard (like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day). Not only was the food not good, our waitress was not very friendly (she seemed like she was in a bad mood). Definitely not the TJ's I remember. Not sure if I will ever go back."}
{"text":"First and foremost Ilene killed it this morning after 5 tables sat all at once right @ 5am!  The food is always fresh and the portion sizes well they're HUGE!   Thank you to the best staff in the Valley we appreciate the great service and most importantly the AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"This place was great!!!  I'm SUPER EXCITED to come back and get the Green Chili omelette   My husband let me have a bite of his...   Mmmmmmm.  And don't get me started on the Cinnamon Rolls  D - Lish!!!  We will definitely coming back to this sweet little Diamond in the rough. Get there late if you are going on the weekend.  It's good so it's busy!!!  But TOTALLY worth the wait :-)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since 1999 and it's still just as good as the first time. The service: It's like your favorite aunt taking care of your order. What a sweet group of servers! The food: Best eggs in Arizona and the biscuits & gravy are to die for. The best part: They just expanded and remodeled the whole place, so the wait time is almost non-existent! Five stars for this gem!"}
{"text":"Ordered a biscuit and it was not done in the middle. I saw at another table someone sent back a cinnamon roll for the same reason. A/C vent points right onto the table."}
{"text":"Great for brunch, lunch or dinner if you want great homemade (not homestyle but homemade) everything. And huge portions of most anything you'd want. Cant wait to make my way back to Phoenix for some TJ's."}
{"text":"Love the food and the way you're greeted when coming in \"what took you so long\" after eating there I asked myself the same question. Great southern style breakfasts, great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time eating here and omg best breakfast around!!! I am definitely coming soon again for lunch/dinner. Food was really good, great prices and they hook you up with a lot of food! Staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"There are so few down home mom and pop places in the west valley.  This one is a gem. No frills great home cookin'.  Best biscuits and gravy you will EVER enjoy! And their pecan pie is TO DIE FOR. (Order one in advance to take home.)  Staff makes us feel right at home.  Reminds me of the good ole small town diners back home. Now one of our regular haunts, can't beat it for breakfast."}
{"text":"So our first time here, been passing it for quite some time and decided lets give it a shot. We were seated right away, got our drinks and order pretty quickly. Our waitress was very nice and checked on us several times. I had the chicken fried steak, I had to order it because it said it was home made not like other places, with  a side of pancakes. My son ordered the chicken quesadilla, my husband ordered the big breakfast. My chicken for steak, well it is very different from what you would get somewhere else, I really didn't see breading on it, just seemed like a tenderized meat with gravy on top, the gravy was OK the meat had a different kind of taste and honestly I couldn't decide whether or not I liked it. My pancakes were flat kind of tough not fluffy. My son liked his quesadilla but really how do you mess that  up? My  husband said his food wasnt bad but nothing to rave over. Honestly all though it wasn't terrible I don't think it was enough to go back to."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for 6 years mainly for breakfast.  Typically it's quite good, however recently there was an exception.  My significant other ordered the chicken fried steak.  Later in the day he became violently ill.  He noticed there was something not quite right with his meal, it had a purplish hue to it.  He's not one to complain or make a fuss and he consumed half of it.  About 6 hours later he became violently ill.  This man was in army and used to eating not the highest quality food.  He spent the next few days very ill and not leaving the bathroom much.  We are certain his illness was good related.  Even now it's a week later and he still a little weak.  Lesson learned never order the Chicken Fried Steak if you don't want to spend a few days in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Love the food.   Cinnamon raisin toast is my favorite..  Grumpy owners.  Grumpy staff.  Don't like the new no substitution policy.  What happened to the 'We never day no to the  customer .' policy? We were once a week visitors,  but now maybe once a every couple a months."}
{"text":"Tried and true. Today I had the special Mediterranean omelet. I also gave their new citrus carrot juice a try. I was very pleased with both. If you haven't been here don't call yourself a local"}
{"text":"Imma give these guys 3 stars.  Every time I cruise by this joint, they are packed, usually on the weekend.  I mobbed by today and it was dead, it was early.  All the wait staff has emphysema, i'm certain of that. Aside from the \"Smoking Dead\" we ordered.  Here it goes.  Special:  Quesadilla omelette - had bacon, egg, cheese, salsa, onion. Thing was big as a man hole cover down town. Packed with flavor. Didn't stand a chance.  1 fluffy pancake. The waitress, didn't catch her name so we'll call her \"Ashley\" because she smokes a carton a day, and smoking causes \"Ashes\" so we'll go with Ashley. She talked us into a pancake, said they were the best.  It was the best. Bad ass, and fluffy!  Bean Omlette - Sounds fucky, but here's what it is. A Cheese Omellte with Chili drizzled all over it. You have to get it with sour cream, and cheese on top, with Salsa. Devine!  Flavor IED if you will!  Biscuits and gravy, again, portions are out of control. I've had better biscuits and gravy, but the biscuit was super fluffy, gravy was middle of the road. I ate it like it was the last meal.  Ashley was very on the spot with the coffee, and kept checking in with us.  I'm gonna go back on the weekend and see how the service is.  Had a good time, great company, but I have to start to be real with my ratings, unless I'm getting paid, or the bill picked up for free, I'm gonna find it hard to give someone 5."}
{"text":"We went to TJ's for the first time this morning since moving to the area a couple of weeks ago.  WOW!  What a great place.  The menu is large enough that there is something for everyone.  The server was great and accommodating.  The food---what can I say.  All three of us at the table had no leftovers---it was that good.  The food was brought out hot and it was fresh.  They were busy this morning and yet, the food was hot and service was fantastic.  We have found our Sunday morning after church restaurant.  Keep up the good work and see you soon---after your vacation!"}
{"text":"This place is a trip, cute old school mom pop place, the food is ok nothing to write home about but decent. The main issue I have with this place is the Owners, have gone here for breakfast/lunch about 5 times last 6 weeks, I have seen these two \"men\" (act like children) argue more than once, get mad at customers who have a complaint or yell at the wait staff in front of all the customers. We showed up two Sunday's ago at 12:30 still had a 10-15 minute wait, the one owner who writes down names seem to keep dozing off at the front desk. Finally get seated look around and notice there was 13 tables that had not been served food, then to be told the cook walked out, the people next to us had waited over an hour for their meal. Then the Owner tells the bus-boy to go out and turn away any customers that pull in, really? The Owners are in the wrong business they are NOT customer friendly, always grumpy, and complaining about something. Like this place too bad the Owners dont appreciate the people who give them a paycheck and the great staff they have working for them.  Of course when you learn what TJ's stands for it makes perfect sense. TJ= two jerks!"}
{"text":"Was told how good the food was here so I thought I would give it a try I ordered the chicken fried steak and pancakes the portions were huge but the chicken fried steak was like eating cardboard no flavorpancakes were OK nothing special service was there the only good thing I can say was I did not have to wait for my bill"}
{"text":"Had several of the breakfast menu items. Taste is from scratch. The decor is bland and forgetful but the atmosphere created by the local clientele makes for a pleasant and interesting experience. I felt immersed in the life of the Avondale citizens here."}
{"text":"Been here twice both times the food was a failure.  I was raised in the farmland of southern Indiana so I know homestyle/country cooking/food.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy the first time and could not finish it.  The gravy tasted sugary sweet and had ZERO sausage in it and the biscuits were hard to describe, hard is not quite the right word but the only one I can think of that fits.  The second time was today.  (I hoped they had a bad day the first time.) Today I ordered Chicken Fried Steak.  I was gross, the steak was just ground beef made into a patty with breading put on it and deep fried.  It tasted like sausage and was insanely greasy.  I did not finish it, in fact I think I only had three or four bites.  The gravy was done very well this time and had sausage in it.  The toast had very little butter just as a side note.  You would do yourself a serious favor by going anyplace else.  There are both a Waffle House and Black Bear Diner north of this place on Dysart.  They HAVE to be better than this place, heck McDonald's would be better."}
{"text":"This is your southern style diner. As a southerner, I can say this is as close as it gets in Phoenix!  Staff is always friendly and get you sat as soon as possible. The pancakes are especially flavorful and fluffy, biscuits are moist, bacon and sausage is right on time and the hashbrowns... well they're hashbrowns... browned, buttery, and greasy... just the way it should be.  No complaints for TJ's, it is just what you should expect from a diner. I'll be back to try the \"Whole Shebang\" again..."}
{"text":"Don't usually make reviews but this visit was pretty uncomfortable. Our waitress was Jodi and we thought it started sarcastically comedic but it wasn't. We felt uneasy to ask for anything. She was helping everyone around us with no problem but when it came to us it felt like it was a hassle. Everything we asked for was met with a rude response. Also I'm not sure if they changed their policy but we used to be able to substitute pancakes for French toast. I had half my plate of food still and when asked if I was done I said yes and my food was thrown away. Did not get asked if I wanted a box. Towards the end she was at a table near us and we were talking about ordering their giant cinnamon roll but before we could order she ran back and gave us our checks.  The food here is good and the service isn't usually like this. Just disappointed with today. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what."}
{"text":"Always great food and fast service!!  Love this place!!  The veggie scramble was delicious and the cinnamon rolls are huge!!  The fruit cups came with grapes, blueberries, blackberries, pineapple...Kids love it!!"}
{"text":"Cool little place, you can they've been there forever and have a great following.  The biscuits and gravy were okay but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Un lugar al mas puro estilo de granja americano, parece casa de abuelita y te atienden de la misma manera que atiendes a la familia, la comida bastante buena y hecha en casa... la decoración cuida muy bien los detalles de casa vieja pero limpia"}
{"text":"We just moved to Goodyear, AZ (from Sun City West) and we were looking for a good country breakfast. The pictures of the food looked good. My wife read a couple of the recent reviews and expressed her concern that the older reviews were very good, but maybe it has changed. We were both happy we decided to overlook the bad reviews. The service and attitude of the waitress was excellent. The food came out in half of the time we were expecting and exactly as ordered. After we ate I mentioned the recent bad reviews to the waitress on Yelp. She explained 4 employees did not come in for work the previous weekend and with all of the snowbirds coming back, the restaurant was slammed with customers. (she was also training another waitress). The owner even stopped by the table a little later to make sure we were happy with our experience. I told him our experience was outstanding. Read the majority of the reviews not just a few bad ones. If you miss a real Midwest style breakfast then you will probably be glad you tried TJs. We visited on a Tuesday, it sounds like they are very busy on weekends, but there is a reason they are busy."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and pretty good. The service was great and our waitress was very sweet.   We got the big breakfast. The bacon is delicious but the hash browns were super bland and the eggs were way too runny. The sausage was good but a little too much salt."}
{"text":"So good!! Excellent biscuits and gravy- I thought I was back in the South. Hubby had pancakes which were big and fluffy. Huge servings as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We chose to go here instead of Cracker Barrel and boy are we glad we did! This was great country cooking along with service that makes you feel like family.. The menu has so many delicious options and they are so accommodating. We went in with 8 kids(7 and under) and 8 adults and we had a fabulous experience with delicious food with great prices! This is our new spot for great breakfasts."}
{"text":"Stop by for pancake today the service and food was good. The only thing I would suggest if you are a owner you should be dress more professional and carry a conversation.  Prices are high, and service is a little slow"}
{"text":"I love having a mom and pop near my house and every time we visit we really want to enjoy our stay but we always leave disappointed. Everybody from the hostess to our waitress to the bitter lady at cash out has an attitude every time we visit. Cash out lady is the absolute worst. The food is good, but not what it used to be.  If you're in the younger generation I wouldn't recommend dining here, they will not treat you nicely."}
{"text":"Great local place, very local feel, simple food, well prepared.  If you are in the area, worth the stop!"}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. I literally just made a yelp account JUST so I could write a review.. the manager (I think he was the manager) was a total asshole and treated his employees like garbage, cussing them out I front of customers. We didn't even get seated yet and we wanted to leave because how much of a dick he was. The parking lot was packed and took us ten minutes to find a spot but it wasn't even worth it. I don't know how the food is because we didn't even get to that part. His bad attitude ruined the entire experience. On top of it, it is my birthday and we just wanted to find a cool spot in town to eat. Total waste of time."}
{"text":"Huge sized servings that are definitely cooked from scratch.  This place is family friendly and the employees are busy, but still nice.  If you're planning on going on a Sunday, get there early! It seems this place is busiest after \"church hours\" and you'll have a wait!"}
{"text":"I like supporting this place because it's a nice change from all the other \"big box\" restaurant chains in the area, but I agree with other reviewers that the host on weekend is short tempered and there is a \"hurry up and go\" feeling.  The food is good comfort food and you get plenty of it, but it was sort of bland.  The place needs some serious updating. It probably looks the same as it did when it opened way back when.  I do agree that if the host was the owner, he needs some serious attitude adjustment. Being rude to customers or barking at your staff is just bad business. While I appreciate wanting to get people in and out quickly to minimize wait times, I almost felt like my business wasn't appreciated. A feeling I don't get at IHOP up the road."}
{"text":"Came for the pie  Don't make it south of of the I-10 often.  Heard that TJ's has some of the best pie in the state, so we swung by.  The place reminds me of the diners in Chicago burbs.  Small-ish, busy, decorated partly like a home, and a clear 1950s/1960s vibe.  Wait staff was nice and sat us quickly.  Lunch of sandwiches was good.  And the pie-- one peach crumb and one coconut cream-- were indeed yummy.  Can't say they were incredible, though.  However, we didn't have apple or cherry since we were told that they are saved for the Friday night service, which is apparently their only dinner shift.  From the menu, I think this place would rock for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love TJ's. Over the last two months we've gone 2-3x a week. The service is in steady decline & today's service was horrible.  No chipped beef special (every Monday my butt).  3 tables came, ate, and left in the time it took to get our food!  40 minutes for a plain waffle? Really?  Every single order of potatoes (4 orders) were wrong.  Eggs Benny = congealed sauce from sitting to long.  Had to get my kids meal TO GO because EVERYONE was done eating by the time his waffle came. The excuse was, \"they burned the first 2\"!  40.00 breakfast and I left feeling ripped off & disgusted. Sadly, it might be time to find a new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I had the chili and half turkey sandwich, had the quality of cafeteria food. My dad had the fish fry and it seemed as though the fish was refried because it was a little tough on the outside didn't really break apart like fresh fish might. My friend had a burger and she said the meat was different from the last time she was there, probably won't go back except maybe for breakfast."}
{"text":"Super great place for eating mass quantities ! Service was quick and the pumpkin pancakes were first rate"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great portions. The rumor on the street is true, the biscuits and gravy are phenomenal! Service rocked as well, never saw the bottom of my coffee cup until it was time to exit the building. I will be back, oh yes, I will be back."}
{"text":"Cinnamon rolls are amazing! My boyfriend is more of a desert person, but wow! Our meals were delicious, our server was friendly and attentive! Don't miss this sweet little diner!"}
{"text":"Long wait for a table but the food was great.  Big portions and everything was cooked perfectly.  I can see why they are always busy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for breakfast like grandma makes, then don't look any further! TJ's has a home feeling to go with the food. Their chicken fried steak is amazing.  The employees are warm and welcoming.  This will be my new go to for breakfast. Can't wait to see how dinner is!"}
{"text":"Although the structure itself is not a top of the line building and the decor is not five star quality, the staff and the food is excellent.  The wait staff is friendly, attentive, and fast.  The food is priced well and the portions are large.  Free refills on drinks.  It is usually pretty busy but rarely a wait to be seated unless you go on Saturday or Sunday mornings. The parking lot behind the restaurant could use a resurfacing and spaces can be limited at times. I would recommend this place to a friend, especially if you have a large appetite. You really get the small family business and southern comfort feeling here.   Side note: You're doing yourself injustice if you don't try one of the giant cinnamon rolls while you're there. They're definitely big enough to share between a 3-4 people."}
{"text":"My favorite place ever! Fell in love when I found this place on Yelp and tried it out. Its mothers day  today and my family said I can go wherever i want so I'm excited for Tjs cuz. Yep TJs is my choice. Came here on my birthday and the staff got the whole restaurant to sing me happy birthday it was awesome! They take care of you here! Welp gotta go, we just pulled up and as on any special day, there's a wait."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I came On sunday and got the brosted chicken. It came with yummy, homemade chicken soup, coleslaw, baked beans, and corn bread. It was honestly all amazing and super cheap! My family all got breakfast food. French toast, they said was amazing. Only bad comment is they don't have real butter, they use margarine. Kind of took away from the corn bread and French toast :( next time we are bringing our own butter! Haha"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I got one of there combos. Bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits and gravy the whole bit. After I eat almost  half the mean I noticed there was hair in my food. I brought this to there attention and they acted nonchalant and no resolution.   Today I decided to give them a second chances with my bf. He got the French tost meal witch was okeay. I got the country fried chicken witch was repulsive. All it was, was a ground meat patty that was fried. Had absolutely no flavor was basically like eating cardboard. Then we waited over 25 minutes to receive our check after eating our food. We will never be coming here again and we are for sure going to tell  friends and family kn about our horrible experience and also will never come back  here agen.  FYI -after eating at this horrible place I got food poisoning. Spent hours laying in bed and throwing up. DO NOT GO HERE !!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Sometimes just with my kids, sometimes in groups of 20-30. We always enjoy ourselves and the food is amazing!!! They have never messed up our food and are always in positive attitudes! I love their pies they do around holiday season. There is going to be a wait!!! They get busy but are absolutely worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"We were headed to Black Bear diner, but when we got there it was packed. We needed a quick breakfast spot before dropping off family at the airport. My husband yelped TJs and so we stopped in! Needless to say Black Bear is a place of our past!! TJs was AMAZING, the service was quick, and our waitress was as sweet as could be!! The food was served in larger delicious portions!!! Dont forget to grab a Cinnamon Roll!!!!"}
{"text":"Tjs is a fantastic place for breakfast on the weekend.  Good old fashioned country food with big portions and cheap prices.  The food here is quality.  It is a mom and pop joint and they take pride in there place it shows a lot of the customers are regulars and they know them by name.  They have a back lot for extra parking.    I had the green chili omelet the salsa was to die for and my wife had the sausage and egg plate her links were huge !  Coffee filled fast and servers were kind and wonderful.    They have pretty much anything you can want that is breakfast fare.  They are well known for the bacon and biscuits and gravy. The location is pretty easy to get to just head south on dysert and the place will be on the right side of the road.  They take credit and debit also.   Give it a shot for breakfast it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this place dissuade you from going in. The inside is very clean and nice and the booths and tables all look new (or newly remodeled). The atmosphere is very much like an old country kitchen.   Went in planning on having breakfast and ended up ordering lunch instead. The hot roast beef sandwich was insanely good. The bread was thick and they provide you with a knife but it cuts with a fork like it's made of cotton candy. The roast beef is very lean without a lot of funk in it and the gravy and fries were great.   Tasted the pancakes and they were out of this world good. Very happy to have chanced upon this place and I will happily go back."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go here and eat. When my wife and I first walked in it was packed. I thought  that the waiting time  would be long. That was not the case at all we were greeted at the door and seated  within 8min. The food was delicious , gravy, hash browns, bacon, eggs, sausage the whole nine. There servings are huge so be prepared to take home  a doggy bag. The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star  is because it took forever to get our food. Is it worth the wait? I just don't like waiting to long especially if I'm starving."}
{"text":"To start off the waitress wanted to argue not once but twice throughout dinner. I have been here on several occasions and never had a meal like I did this evening. Country fried steak was tough! Had gravy on side ( which had some biscuit in it) hash browns were crispy glad I didn't order that way like I normally do. All that said I will reiterate that the waitress wanted to argue about the gravy saying it was fresh and Did Not have biscuits in it. Lol. I myself being a chef for over 35 years and counting I know when gravy is fresh and when it has been sitting and warmed up with A Piece Of Biscuit in it! I will not return when she is working for I feel Not like arguing with someone that serves the public. I don't argue with my own staff let alone amyone else in the hospitality industry.  Chef Pat Marcotte"}
{"text":"Comforting spot in the west valley with great food. Belgian waffle with blueberries is my choice here."}
{"text":"we eat almost once a week there.   all the servers are amazing but Barb is the best =)  food is delicious.  these cooks know what they're doing.  biscuits and gravy sooooo good. my husband always Gets a bacon avacado omelette with holondaise and he loves it.  we went for there braised chicken dinner once and it was so good.  it came with chicken soup that was homemade.  I still can't stop thinking about it.    thank u tjs.  oh and especially today the young brunette server was a sweetheart. they are all amazing"}
{"text":"Farmers breakfast and their french toast is a must to try. Farmers breakfast consists of their home made biscuits,  scrambled egg with tomatoes,  onions, and bacon all topped with their sausage gravy and cheese.. talk about goodness in your mouth! Good enough for two people. French Toast made, with French bread."}
{"text":"Very good food. Waffle crisp and cooked the way ordered. Eggs perfect. Nice portions. Fried chicken, big meaty pieces. Service good and kind staff. Will go again if in the area. Prices very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while. walked in this morning and noticed some changes, looks like some remodeling has been going on, a positive improvement. Since I'm off my diet  this weekend i got the cinnamon that has always been huge, YUM. finished off my breakfast with some eggs, hash browns, bacon and some toast. I opted for water to keep my dieting hopes alive for Monday morning.... as always packed with customers, get here when they open."}
{"text":"Down to earth, home style food and service. Food was real not previously frozen. Service was fast and friendly. We will be back!!! So full right now the portions are huge! We had the Chicken fried steak and our son had the meat scramble and all of it was awesome."}
{"text":"First time there for breakfast and it was very very good.  The service was great and the waitress had my husband and I try their homemade raisin bread which was sooooo good.  There was no wait once the order was placed. Food was hot and fresh. Will being going back again for breakfast and also trying the lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"This place has a great old  time country vibe to it, the staff was amazing and the service was very  quick and the food was amazing. I would recommend this place to those who are looking for a great vibe"}
{"text":"We've been visiting TJ's for only about a year now, despite having lived on the west side for 30+ years, and so far we have enjoyed all of our meals there...breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  We usually visit on Sundays, after church, but we've also gone other mornings for breakfast.  The longest we've had to wait for a table is maybe 10 minutes.  TJ's is not fancy, but everything is homemade, even their hamburger buns!  The biscuits and gravy are delicious, but huge, and definitely coma-inducing!  One of my favorite things about their menu is their senior menu.  Although I am a long way from being a senior, they allow anyone to order from it, so I'm able to enjoy smaller portions of my favorite foods.  While most of what we've had has been excellent, occasionally there has been a miss....an overcooked egg or cold hash browns.  However, usually, everything is delicious!  If you live on the west side of Phoenix, give TJ's a try....you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"TJ's is a delicious diner. You should go. The cinnamon roll is amazing. Friendly staff & quirky decor. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is still ok but the fact that I can't order food the way I want it is ridiculous. That and the fact I have witnessed management berate the wait staff in front of customers makes me not plan to return."}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday morning and I got the whole shibang breakfast. When I got my food it wasn't hot it was warm... Bacon wasn't crispy, pancakes were flat and their country gravy wasn't homemade. I've made myself homemade country gravy before and theirs isn't. This was first time going here and more likely my last."}
{"text":"Amazing again!  We love this place, great food at an affordable price.  I love the smaller portions part of their menu, it is the perfect amount of food for me.  Had the half waffle with bacon and hash browns and they were yummy!  My husband had the special, a green chili omelet, delicious!  The green chili had great flavor.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Going to this place for years. Love it and will go every Sunday still. The owner is not very nice and leaves the middle of the job to smoke. But service is great always"}
{"text":"I only get to TJs about once a year, so I was pleasantly surprised to see they totally renovated the ante room w/ new booths, tables and chairs!! Looks great, and provides a fresh/bright environment, way better than the formerly dingy, \"beyond old school\" theme.  The chow? Always good!! I enjoy the scrambled eggs and sausage, and on occasion the chicken fried steak. Good stuff!! Service has that \"diner feel\": efficient sans cozy sentiment. Fine by me, because it works.  Cheers!

{"text":"Portions are huge and food is very tasty. We had a table of 8 so we had quite the variety to try. When we arrived the parking lot was full but it wasn't much of a wait.  I would have rated higher but the waitress was terrible. We waited longer to order than we did for a table."}
{"text":"Great place for some homestyle food. The portions are large and the food is yummy. We came at the recommendation of a friend and he was right. My hubby got the wet burrito and I got the western omelet with hash browns and biscuits. It was all good. We will be back. I want to try one of their famous pies next time."}
{"text":"Had a big Sunday morning breakfast delivered via door dash. It was excellent. The big cinnamon roll was fantastic, the omelette, sausage and hash browns as well. A hidden gem in Goodyear"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I was very pleasantly surprised by this quaint little corner restaurant & bakery! My family of 5 came in for breakfast and was greeted by a sweet lady named Barbara. She took us to our table right away. Everything is simple and straight forward; from the menus to the decor. (They even have some pretty humorous signs all over the place!) Their menu is pretty expansive but not \"unique\" in what you would find in a contemporary joint. However, what IS unique (or rather, OUTSTANDING) is their true-to-word traditional homestyle cooking. NOW THIS is what I'd imagine a blast from the past diner would be like. In fact, I'm pretty sure it is. Though the place and the fare are simple, the food (though \"traditional\") certainly is not! Everything tastes and looks fresh. In fact, I think everything is homemade. Their biscuits were tender and flaky, but not dry. Their gigantic cinnamon rolls are absolutely delicious! I ordered hash browns, eggs over easy and corned beef hash...and somehow, they managed to make them taste better than your typical chain breakfast/brunch joints. For how inexpensive it is, they sure do give you A LOT of food. This is quality and quantity in one. I wish all restaurants were like this! Do not judge a book by its cover! This place is a wonderful and homey place to eat at! Thanks TJ's!"}
{"text":"The parking lot was full, which is a good sign. Luckily there was extra parking in the back. We only waited 15 minutes even though the lobby was full and drink orders were taken as soon as we sat down. Sadly it took about 30 minutes to get our food. I get that the food is supposed to be fresh, but I think that long for breakfast (bacon, eggs, and pancakes) is too long. The food was good, but not worth the wait. It wasn't any better than I could get at any other diner. The grits were undercooked was the only real food complaint. The best thing I ate was the raisin bread. I would have given four stars, but the wait being long in addition to  the food being just decent just doesn't earn the fourth star."}
{"text":"I've been to Tj's about 6 times. The last two times to meet friends who wanted to meet there. It's the kind of place i wanted to like. Small, locally owned, greasy spoon. The food was just sooo bad. I haven't been back since January 2015 though. Maybe it's gotten better."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give this place a star period! Absolutely terrible customer service and the food was nothing more than mediocre. In fact our country fried steak was undercooked. We didn't get our coffees refilled, asked for napkins and the server brought 2 napkins out for a table a 5, additional item was added to our tab that we didn't order. Our waitress had a bad attitude and when we ordered additional items she would just walk away without any acknowledgement. This was our first and last time. Never again! What a waste of time. Everything from the wait time to checking out was unpleasant. You could tell that this place is just for local regulars not newbies. If this is your first time here just walk away and  save yourself, you can thank me later! ;) Last but not least they didn't even have paper in the ladies restroom."}
{"text":"I loved this place, but then they came out with the no \"frill\" menu. What's the no frills menu you may ask? You can't substitute nothing or modify anything. Don't like hashbrowns tough shit you have to order diced potatoes on the side. I ask the server politely if she could and she said nope it has to come with harsh Browns no modifications even on ingredients. What kind of customer service is this? Especially since we have been coming here for years and now they can't even sub stuff out. Also they took away items off the menu. I know you're a popular place, but that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. Yeah the managers are a**holes, but once you're seated you don't deal with them. So that wasn't a big deal. It's a shame hopefully they realized that they royally screwed up."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Staff is very friendly. Had belly buster burger so good!!! Waffle fries were the best. Burger lived up  to its name. I will be back and, excited about trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Reading the description of the chicken fried steak, you'd think it's something to try before leaving this earth. What I got instead was a sad piece of grey matter in burned and leathery breading with a side of raw hash Browns. This is a place I'm sure was wonderful and may still be at times. But the cook on my day apparently isn't holding up those standards."}
