{"text":"Loved having drinks and food at this place! We ordered the crab beignets and the cheese plate. The beignets were amazing! The cheese plate was a generous portion of mixed cheeses, fruit and nuts. The ambiance to this place was very nice."}
{"text":"Good happy hour deals. Place is dark but swanky. We ordered a burger and chicken panini to go, ate it on the grass with a glass of wine. The grounds are perfect for Eating outside. Really enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night. Very pretty outdoor space. Unfortunately we waited 10-15 minutes for everything. To begin, I went in and asked if we could seat ourselves outside and was told \"yes.\" We waited easily 10 minutes before the same gal came out and claimed she didn't see us sitting there (weird). We ordered cocktails (10 min wait). Ordered waters (10 min wait). The worst was when we ordered food and an expediter brought it out, but the crackers that came with the salmon tartare were covered in fennel which completely overpowered the meal. We had to flag down another waitress to ask for some bread to replace the crackers, and again, we waited 10-15 mins (for bread!). By the time I got my bread to eat my dish with, my husband had already finished his meal. For such a nice resort, I did not care for the service at all. I would go back because of great ambience and location-but don't be in a hurry!"}
{"text":"The Moscow Mule is probably the best I've ever had...I may need another to be sure. The atmosphere is very sexy and intimate but a great spot for get togethers with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing mixology! Our bartenders Chuck and Charlie rocked it. Drinks were great! My husband and I loved it.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The most delicious HH menu! Big plates, cheap price, wonderfully cooked ... quiet atmosphere so don't go there trying to be loud. It is more of a classy place great for dates and a nice time with friends.  Beautiful surroundings and did I mentioned how good the food was. We ate it all before realizing we didn't take a picture.  Had the hummus plate, skewers, mussels and a burger.... even the pickle that came with the burger was perfect!"}
{"text":"After years of coming here, I just have to say this is the most beautiful patio in the Valley.  Gorgeous bistro lights, a bubbling fountain, lovely music and palm trees. We love to come here for great cocktails, a cigar, and delicious appetizers before dinner out. Be sure to ask for Korey, one of the best servers in town.  He is personable, attentive, and an all around pleasure to interact with. This is the perfect spot to celebrate with a date or friends!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic evening at the Mix Up Bar! Great service, delicious food, awesome live music and a relaxing atmosphere. The popcorn is my favorite and they have a great happy hour -  even on Saturday. But the best part is the attentive and warm service. Thanks for another great evening!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this spot out. The bartenders are definitely the stars of this place! The cocktails were delicious and the bartenders were very skilled at suggesting what to drink. This will definitely be a go to spot if I'm looking for a good cocktail! The decor is a more plush, cozy, traditional decor that you'd probably expect at the Royal Palms. The food was pretty good but didn't knock my socks off. The short rib tacos were tasty but the sliders were dry. But seriously... those drinks were awesome!"}
{"text":"So I went there again on their Burger and Bourbon Night. The burger was so freaken good, it had a perfect blend of mild spices, and topped with a melted smoked mozzarella. The fries were great, a White Truffle Oil with a Garlic Lemon Aioli. And the drinks are perfect. I always get a French 75 and the bartender makes it very well. Charlie, the bartender/ server is extremely nice and very much a mans man, and very handsome! Men would enjoy the surroundings and the drinks. Great for business and hanging out. Women would love it for Charlie, Women Wednesdays and the great foods."}
{"text":"This is the bar on the Royal Palms Resort property and I couldn't be more happier regarding our visit. Driving in we were immediately greeted and asked what we needed, valet, public parking, the bar, etc. So yes, you have both valet or if you continue on the roundabout there's a lot for public parking.   The bar (go through the main courtyard with a fountain to get there) was extremely elegant and sophisticated, simply stunning. There's even a fireplace, and romantic lighting.   Our server, Katie, was very attentive and informative, telling us about the history of the property (it used to be someone's home) as well as what else the property has to offer, a pool, verandas, etc.  The food was excellent, we had the Sirloin Skewers and the Chocolate Torte. Both were very rich and resonably priced.  The grounds itself were beautiful, lots of pathways to walk and talk. There are even a couple of courtyards and water features where you can unwind and relax. If you're very adventurous, there's a corn hole game and a giant Jenga set near a cabana going east of the bar. (I'm glad we explored the property!)  While playing corn hole after our delicious meal we were even offered water by staff that saw us playing - wonderful service!  So if you're looking for a delightful, classy, and fun date night, look no further. :) Loved this place, and will be back!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Royal Palms for a few days and loved the bar.  I stumbled on it when I was waiting for my room.  The servers were excellent, the bar tenders were friendly and engaging.   I went their all three nights of my visit and had friends join me."}
{"text":"*Happy Hour Review*  Three words: Duck Confit Poutine - rich, delicious, large portion. The name says it all - and my pictures do not do it any justice!  Three more words: Lobster Corn Dogs - small plate with only 3 pieces - but incredibly well prepared, delicious and hey - lobster for $5.00!?!  Three more words: Half price bourbon! Two incredibly well crafted and incredibly generous Manhattans later, I was feeling no pain!  One of the best parts of PHX is the under-appreciated happy hour deals at some of our best resorts. Especially this time of year - there are great values to be had, at incredible prices!  Here's the Mix Up current specials menu: Daily - happy hour 4-7; $5.00 cocktails, beer, wine and lite bites. Tuesdays - Pizza & Punch $5 flatbreads, $6 signature punch cocktail of the day: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Women & Whiskey Wednesdays - 1/2 price ladies bourbon night: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Bourbon & Burgers Thursdays - $8 burger, 1/2 price bourbons: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.  .Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Relaxing place to unwind and have a nice glass of wine or an expertly made cocktail!  We stopped in during happy hour and enjoyed their house white and red wine for $5...it was surprisingly good!  We also shared an order of the smoked potato croquettes.  They were delicious and very flavorful.    Great atmosphere, great wine and cocktails and good service too!"}
{"text":"Cozy bar with delightful adult beverages in a beautiful and decorative atmosphere. Great place to relax and strike up a conversation with tourists and locals alike. Bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. The food has been hit or miss during my visits...just better off grabbing dinner at T Cook's next door. However the drinks are always exquisite and make any time here worth the while."}
{"text":"Cool place. Live music is great. Recently stopped by for a drink on a Friday evening before heading out to dinner while staying at the resort. Ordered a nice single malt \"neat\". Enjoyed it immensely. When the bill game I was charged $12 more than what was listed on the drink menu. Questioned the server about it who told us that because I ordered it \"neat\" they charged more. I didn't make a big deal about it because it's not my style but I will sure as hell never drink here again. Honor prices on the menu or at least mention it if there is a hidden up-charge."}
{"text":"We loved the coziness ... craft drinks are sweet, but they have a variety of liquor brands... music was nice romantic touch... didn't eat, will go back for T Cook's... beautiful property."}
{"text":"Subtle changes to the old bar area.  The bartender made me a custom cocktail with Bulleit rye bourbon and AZ Bitters Lab Figgy Pudding and it was very good."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the feeling of escaping reality as you pull up and walk into the Royal Palms Resort.  I've been a regular visitor through the years, dating back well before the renovation just over a year ago, and my husband was more of a regular for years before me!  The Mix Up Bar definitely mixed things up from their PR (pre-renovation) days.  I've been several times since and I still really enjoy the atmosphere and friendly service... I'm not going to lie; it's not exactly like the good ol' days though!  What's consistent is the people-watching, attentive service, live music on many nights, solid cocktails, beer and wine to choose from.  There is also a certain je ne sais quoi about this place... it's definitely a gem!  The food menu isn't as impressive as it used to be... I miss the lobster bisque and paella!  I am pretty sure they still have the amazing bread with pesto, and you can't go wrong with that, but not a ton of other items appealed to me.  On a recent visit, we shared a charcuterie plate, a side of brussels sprouts, and a cauliflower soup.  I wouldn't get the soup again, but the other items weren't bad!  Eric who runs the bar now is easy to chat with and does a great job... no doubt we'll be back soon, even without some of my old time favorite menu items!"}
{"text":"Food and Drinks here are spot on...plus a very chill atmosphere!  A hidden gem located in the royal palms resort.  Try the Butter Croissant Bread Pudding!"}
{"text":"What a cute bar- and the happy hour was a good deal (except the fact that they took off the lobster corndogs as a happy hour item).  Here is the order of a party of 2: A glass of Pinot Noir which was good, a glass of beer for my partner (don't ask me what it was), the duck poutine, chorizo bratwurst, and the burger w/ fries.    Surprisingly, it was alot of food for the two of us, but we took it all down like it was nothing.  The bratwurst was 4 pieces and good - I probably wouldn't order it again for $5.  The duck poutine was fries, gravy, and pieces of duck - the flavor was pretty bomb.    The burger probably was the highlight of the night - It tasted divine.  It was so good - it was so crunchy on the outside, but moist in the inside and even though I normally eat a paleo diet, I decided to break all my diet rules and try the burger with the bread. Oh my - the bread - It was light, buttery, toasty and so worth my rulebreaking/  The tab before tip came to $30.  Yes, my friends - it is so worth it especially the $8 happy hour priced burger, normally $17.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about the burger right now."}
{"text":"We loved the Pork Belly Duck Egg Burger! Sweet potato fries are awesome! Great atmosphere! Great service. Will be back for date night! Very nice!"}
{"text":"The royal palms is cool, but the restaurant sucks. Our bill was ridiculous for two people...$225....for appetizers, the lobster bisque was shitty and sweet and had a crusty little crouton in the middle, the duck confit tortellini was just bland with an odd pumpkin (?) sauce, the scallops were undercooked and the rice/risotto attempt was terrible, and my husband's ribeye was over cooked. Two appetizers, two entrees, and a couple drinks that all sucked."}
{"text":"Late night meal after checking into the Royal Palm. I ordered the Italian Paloma ($15) cocktail and the Mussels ($12), my husband a burger ($15). The serving size of the Mussels was big. The mussels had a nice flavor but the seaweed was full of reedy sticks. Burger was good. Service was attentive despite extended chatting by several wait staff at this empty bar at 10pm on a Saturday. The seating was comfortable & the decor pretty."}
{"text":"It's no secret this is one of the most luxurious, aesthetic spots in town. To stay here you're definitely, as the millennials say, \"baller\". And that's why this is the only place that has, without complaint, charmed $14 out of me for a cocktail. It took seemingly forever to make! I didn't recognize the brands of booze used! But it was pretty, tasted good, and made by really chill staff who made certain I'll go out of my way to come back.   Rumor has it this place is way more affordable than you thought it was. Just peep the HH. Want to impress someone? Look no further."}
{"text":"Great place to spend a little down time with friends while you wait for your dinner reservation. Relaxed atmosphere, great service and Happy Hour.  Drinks were good, small bites of food were just enough to tide us over 'til dinner. Would I come back here? You bet I would! How about later today? Meet me there?"}
{"text":"Great happy hour food and drink especially the poutine.   The ambience is spectacular and service is spot on as well."}
{"text":"Loved this resort bar, old, historical property with a maze of cabanas old architecture and atmosphere.   The bar is gorgeous and fun to look around and enjoy.   The French 75 is awesome. .. cheers."}
{"text":"Great spot for bringing business clients. Enjoyed the ability to meet for happy hour drinks and taste some light appetizers. The staff was super helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"I'd had this bookmarked for awhile and finally found the perfect night for my fiance and I to give this place a whirl.   For starters, the ambience absolutely cannot be beat. We ending up coming right at dusk, so the beautiful glow of low lighting paired with candles and live music made for a truly romantic setting.  I went with a glass of Malbec and my fiance went with a Manhattan. Both were absolutely delicious and worth the extra $$$. My one regret was not trying food from the bar menu..I guess that means we'll just have to return  (oh, darn!) :)  The property in and of itself is jaw-droppingly beautiful. I highly encourage anyone who visits for dinner/drinks to stroll the courtyards at night - it's pretty magical!  Can't wait to show this place off when we have guests visiting. A must-see when in Phoenix-Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Come here for the Atmosphere and the outstanding service. The food unfortunately left us all kinda flat. The chef here needs to work more with flavors.  If you came back when T-cooks had another chef things have definitely changed. That amazing Paella is also gone. Although we only at the the Mix Up bar and not T-Cooks, we looked at the menu. Didn't do much for us.  We had the Burger, Pannini and Lobster Corn Dog. The corndog was by far the best thing. The burger was much too lacking in flavor considering how messy it was. The Pannini was dry and you can get better at any Paradise Bakery.  My prediction is this chef lasts 1 year."}
{"text":"Great bar inside the Royal Palms Resort. They do it daily happy hour with good food and drink specials. Came tonight for the bourbon and burgers. $8 burger with fries and half price Bourbons on about 7 different styles. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Holy smokes.  For starters, I had a tequila and mescal-based berry cocktail that simply blew me away with the unique and interesting flavour fusions.   As a Canadian, I felt it necessary to sample and judge the poutine. Although by no means a \"traditional\" type of poutine, the dish was amazing. I'm a sucker for duck, so I may be a little biased. Could have used a few more cheese curds.  Atmosphere a little dark and dank for my preferences, but aside from that I have nothing negative to say. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here with a 50+ (age) MeetUp group for happy hour on Taco Tues.  I had the 3 street tacos for $7.  Food was really good, tacos were stuffed to the hilt.    Service was excellent too, no complaints."}
{"text":"Friday night and nothing planned. Alice Tatum is the live music at the Mix Up bar at the Royal Palm. Not much wrong with that picture  It's ridiculously hot outside but the bar is cool and comfortable. Service is quick and really good.  Alice is superb and the bar menu is amazing.  Kobe sliders, crab beignets, caprese flatbread with a spectacular balsamic glaze.  What a great way to spend a few hours"}
