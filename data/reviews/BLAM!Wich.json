{"text":"Scam!wich - TERRIBLE! Found their daily location on Twitter, showed up with food truck fiend friend and found lady standing in truck talking on cell phone for OVER 20 minutes. No service, no class, no sale."}
{"text":"Blamwich was one of four mobile food vendors who catered to the Opening Gala of the Calgary International Film Festival at Eigth Avenue Place. Although it was a one item selection, Jerk Chicken on Baguette, what a treat this was. My only complaint was, if you allow me to plagarize from Emeril Lagasse, the spice seriously needed to be \"kicked up a notch\". Most who were attending were film industry professionals and we can take the heat. It was not a sufficient enough concern to downgrade the rating to four stars.  Servers were carrying the treats, sliced into small hors d'ouvres like sandwiches from the street into the venue and they could barely get six feet inside the door of this huge location before their trays were empty. I cannot remember eating meat on a bun so tender as what we were given to eat. It was a real hit and I ate alone at least a dozen as well as bucket loads of perogies, sausages, fries with cheese (not poutine), and gelato from the three other trucks.  To put icing on the cake, French Champagne maker Moet et Chandon provided the bubbly to wash down the food. Champagne and snack truck food, what a novel idea it was but a huge success among the attendees. Jackie Dupuis, Executive Director of the CIFF has to be commended for this.  If you see the Blamwich truck on your travels about the city, I hope your stomach is empty because I am ordering you to try their fare. You will be stunned with the quality."}
{"text":"Had their Super Mario after a reasonable wait in line of about 30 minutes.  Unfortunately I have to say the sandwich was mostly average.  Wasn't blow my mind away good but didn't suck either.  For the $8 price it was reasonable value.  However I think that after having an epic sandwich from Salumni in Seattle that the bar got set really high for my taste buds.  I will have to revisit it to try the Bacon or Chicken sandwich as they looked much better and a little more chef's touch are involved with making those sandwiches."}
{"text":"This truck has 4-5 sandwiches available on any given day.  To simplify my choice and maximize my enjoyment, I asked for the cashier's favorite and she suggested the Bat Outta Hell (classic rock reference to Meatloaf, for you youngsters).  The $10 meatloaf \"sandwich\" was served in about 5 minutes, and I use quotes because the slab of meat was far too substantial, and the bun too soft, to be eaten with your hands.  The meat was moist and well seasoned, having a easily fork-cuttable consistency. The thoroughly melted cheese on top covered the whole slab handily, and this was in turn covered by enough homemade marinara sauce to get some with every bite of the loaf.  The marinara had rough cut fresh tomatoes in it, and a good hit of basil, making for a deeply flavored yet not heavy meat/cheese/sauce trifecta.    The bun was spread with a lightly flavoured aioli, though the exact nature of the seasoning I can't recall, sorry.  It was most effective to eat the soft white mini loaf in bits along with the meatloaf, and mop up the tasty marinara.  All around, a great filling meal full of home cooked flavour!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was excited to try this truck! I could of not been more disappointed, it was a gorgeous day and was going to enjoy my meal in the park. I thought do to the warm weather, the stormy Gonzales, black bean patty, pico de gallo, cheddar cheese and chipotle mayo...sounded good. Boy was I wrong! It was so salty I had to drink two bottles of water and was still thirsty. Not at all impressed, to many good places to eat in Calgary than go back."}
{"text":"This food truck was part of a show home opening event I attended and I'd have to say it was more like BLAH!wich.  Technically, the truck was brought to cater the event so the limited menu was understandable - grilled cheese with bacon & tomato, chili & bun or tuna melt, but what confused me was that  there was only one person manning the truck! Since everything was made to order, the line grew rapidly. Even though we were 2nd in line, we had to wait 15 mins before we could order and then another 15 mins for our food.   I opted for the grilled cheese and it was alright - I was expecting amazingness based on the reviews on here. My friend got the chili and the bun was cold and rock hard - disappointing!  Maybe this wasn't a true BLAM!wich experience, but it didn't leave a good impression. This was a pre-planned event (that required registration), so they should have been better prepared. I don't think I'd try this food truck again."}
{"text":"When I drove up to Deerfoot Meadows after reading on twitter that the foodtrucks were around the area, I was disappointed to see only two (the other was Jojo's bbq) parked in the area. But none of that mattered when I walked up to Blam!wich and saw the myriad eats they had available!  I ended up getting two items:  -Grilled cheese sandwhich. Simple but greatly executed. I ate it in the cold as I waited for my Jojo's bbq order.  -\"Winter storm\" may sound like a lost G.I. Joe episode. Its a kicked up version of the BLT but with extra goodies like garlic aoli, and cheese. Delicious doesn't do justice as description, more like an all out assault on my tastebuds by Cobra-La!  The price was ok. These two came to about 12 bucks. Even. None of this business of using cents.  15/30"}
{"text":"What happened to you, BLAM!Wich? Your 'Chicken Hawk' sandwich hasn't improved.  The chicken is still brought in pre-cooked and even worse, they don't put the bacon aioli on it anymore but some pesto'y stuff.  I did like the corn relish that is put on it now, but it's no bacon aioli.  I must get my fix of that sauce.  I'm losing it! AHHHHH!"}
{"text":"Ka-blam! Shazooey! Piff! Pfffat! Yowzah! My mouth became an arena for a full on flavour onslaught this afternoon when I had my first try of the Blamwich truck.  Four sandwiches, each one $8. Tax included. I ate the Super Mario panini which consisted of Mortadella, salami, calabrese with provolone, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, olives, basil & arugula with roasted veggie aioli. You put artichoke hearts in anything I'm about to eat and you may just have me eating out of your hand-literally, if you're not careful.  The one downfall to the food trucks at this point are the lineups that ensue. Blamwich is no exception to this rule. It was by no means the 1 hr wait for food at the launch, but it's not a quick bite to eat yet either. They took orders until the grill was full, then halted the line until they caught up to the orders. BWhat I like is that they'll take your name and call it out when your sandwich is ready. No guesswork on who's Super Mario came out first.  Practice makes perfect. Keep lining up for them sammys and I have no doubt the rest will fall into place!"}
{"text":"You see that review below by Heather?  Yeah. She took me to Blamwich. She promised me it would change my life. That when I bit into that sandwich I would see new colors. Smell the sunshine. That the hair on the end of my neck wouldn't sit down for months at a time.  I was not let down.  I ordered the bacon storm sandwich. As soon as it touched my tongue I had to fight all of my primal urges to avoid peeing my pants in utter joy and disbelief. The answer to the question, \"what is the meaning of life?!\" is \"The Bacon Storm\".   If you asked me to recount everything that was on that sandwich, I couldn't. The moment was so incredibly perfect that my mind jettisoned the details from my brain to avoid my dull, every day existence without the bacon storm sandwich to drive me to suicide.   But I recall bacon. lots of it. I recall aioli. I recall feeling my stomach literally leap within me as though I was with child - and I'm a man, so there's no way I should know how that feels. But I do. I do.  If I didn't have to work to make money I'd stalk this truck all over the city and camp outside of wherever they park it at night.  Eat one.  Change your life."}
{"text":"Dammit BLAM!Wich!  I gave you 5 stars and took my co-worker there and we had another 5 star experience.  But I've been 3 times since then and each time has been disappointing so I feel like I have no choice but to update my review.  The last 2 times my sandwich was not bacon-y perfection.  One time you tried to press it into a panini.  You appear to be dating multiple bread vendors.  You've replaced the lettuce with un-melty cheese.  Why Blamwich? Why???  I can't endorse these guys as Gods of the Sandwich until they get off the laurels that the majority of the Calgary Food Truck scene appears to be resting on and bring back their 'A' game.    Oh, and figure out your pricing.  It's different every time and $10 for a sandwich out of a truck is no deal."}
