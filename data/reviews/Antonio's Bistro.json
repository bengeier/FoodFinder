{"text":"I loved this place. Paid for the meal for two and we got enough to feed to big guys with some to spare. The Spicy surf and turf is great!!!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad but it's not exactly fantastic either. We tried the dinner for two meal and we were impressed by the options that were available to us for less than $20. That was a pretty impressive deal and the delivery showed up faster then expected. However, the food was pretty simple and mediocre. If I were visiting from out of town, this would be great. However, I could've easily made this in my own kitchen."}

{"text":"Absolutely incredible. I used the GrubHub application in my iPhone. He has a student discount which was a cherry on top. I got the lunch special chicken penne past and a ceaser salad. Everything is beyond delicious and my expectations. Fantastic prices for how great the food is! Keep it up Antonio :) your doing it right.
Ill be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Antonio's bistro is what I call a 'big bang for your buck' kinda place. Its literally a delivery-only place, so you don't have to deal with the service, or driving there, waiting a long time or even putting pants on. There is a flimsy paper menu that someone leaves at your front door and you just call them up and randomly pick whatever you want.

I thought we definitely got a lot by ordering the \"meal for 2\" which included 2 apps, 2 main dishes, 2 salads and 2 desserts.. all about $30 total. The portions were huge for the price, and everything tasted very decent. The caprese salad was surprisingly fresh and high quality and I thought their meatballs were the best. The salads were standard, the lasagna was abundant and the desserts (cheescake and tiramisu) were very rich and thick. Nothing was crazy orgasmic, but for massive amounts of italian food delivered at your door, I thought it was a pretty great deal."}
{"text":"My favorite delivery only restaurant (they are quick too!) Good food, decent prices, great portions.  I usually order a pasta, which is always tasty and delicious. Definitely order here if you're looking for delivery and are tired of just pizza :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea as to why, but my previous review was removed. I am a true customer and I love the food. The owner is a nice guy and they deliver! Try the surf and turf pesto. It's great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Delivery Only, but they are fast and delicious. We had Lasagna and salads and garlic bread. It's a cool concept and pretty unique as well. If you're looking for good Italian food that isn't just the usual Pizza etc... 

The prices are low and the food portions are huge. They have online ordering that is also mobile friendly. Great place."}
