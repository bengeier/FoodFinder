{"text":"Let me say I am not very impressed. My meat had alright flavor, but had texture like a shoe! I love the cucumber dressing that comes on the gyro, I'll admit to eating a little with the help of a spoon. This place's dressing had no flavor. It tasted like plain yogurt with a couple slivers of cucumber. No thanx, I ended up eating the meat alone with hot sauce!!!!! Thank God for hot sauce or I would starve sometimes!!!!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Greek Chef a few times now and have remained impressed by the friendly and courteous service, as well as by the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the establishment.   I tend toward the gyro meals with feta, tzatziki sauce and fries.  Both times the vegetables were fresh and crispy, the meat flavorful and salty, and the cheese, and sauce cool and complementary to the meal.  While not a romantic hot spot, it offers the perfect quick lunch when you are craving some good Greek comfort food served by a friendly, fast, and relaxed proprietor."}
