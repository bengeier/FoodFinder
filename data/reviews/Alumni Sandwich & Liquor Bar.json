{"text":"This place is a breathe of fresh air to me.  Never before could I find a wicked sandwich with such a good vibe to go along with it.  In the short time it's been open it has filled many different needs of mine.  Lunchtime spot to grab a bite, dinner spot with my wife, and weekend night spot to have some drinks with friends. 

Enjoy it Calgary!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwich's are great. Already been back a handful of times. I have to say they make my favourite burger in Calgary. I avoided it the first couple times I want because it's a sandwich place but I can't stop craving that burger!! Cool diner vibe. Awesome staff. Good prices and great cocktails. Love it here"}
{"text":"Epic sandwiches and really great genuine cocktails. This is one to check out. Plus, the place looks great. It's got a really nice atmosphere. We went on Sunday morning, but I plan to go back later this week after work to try out more stuff on the menu, including the Mexican Torta. Their cocktail menu prices seem great too. Also, it's nice they stay open late. Calgary needs more places to get good quick and quality food after work. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My second visit to this new and vibrant restaurant. Innovative, tasty sandwiches and sides, along with welcoming atttention from Jeremy, Alex, Paul, and others. Sandwiches with great flavours and fresh ingredients. Looks like a great place for lunch, dinner, or a drop in with friends. Good vibe. Contemporary design with many group, single, or pair seating choices. Can't wait for the dust to clear from 17 Ave so we can enjoy the patio. We are told this will come by Stampede. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Located next to Blanco off of 17th Ave, the restaurant front is pretty minimal and unassuming. However, once we opened the door and stepped inside, it totally made us feel like we were at a diner in an Archie comic book haha. 

The space has a good amount of seating and also a bar. I thought it looked very retro but clean at the same time. We were greeted when we walked in, sat down wherever we wanted to and looked over the food and drink menu. Originally when I heard that this was a sandwich place, I thought the menu was going to be super basic - I was wrong! The menu isn't gigantic and overwhelming but had a good amount of variety for appetizers, salads, soups, and of course, sandwiches. Everything sounded delicious but we somehow managed to narrow it down to the beet salad, curried squash soup, deep fried artichokes, and chicken parmesan sandwich. Everything was super delicious and I'd probably have everything again except maybe the beet salad (it was delicious but wasn't as many beets as I would've liked as I LOVE beets - but still very good!). 

We actually ordered the curried squash at first but they accidentally brought out the tomato soup for us. The server was quick to apologize and offer to take it off the bill, and we said no prob and ate the soup anyway. But then they went the extra mile and brought us the curried squash soup.. amazing! I can tell the people who work here actually kind of care about the service they provide here and everyone seemed so friendly. They asked us how our food was on multiple occasions (not in an annoying way) and answered any questions we had about the food and drink items - super awesome :)

Overall, really really really like this place! Totally recommend for a casual bite out and a few drinks! I can't wait to go back next time and I'm a little scared to share this review in case the place starts getting super duper busy.. but if you're contemplating, yes, GO!"}
{"text":"They've got Village Wit, which is a huge bonus. Lots of beers on tap. Grilled cheese sandwich hit home hard. Great vibe. Love the furniture"}
{"text":"First off, the space that used to be a Subway is completely unrecognizable now- very cool and not remotely stuffy, cute banquettes and tables and a lot of seats at the bar so solo diners aren't uncomfortable. Very, very good reno. I got the spicy chicken sandwich and it was fantastic! Buttery  texture, rich and really tasty. Service is super friendly but not overbearing, noise level was fine, good prices for the quality and good beer and cocktail list too though I just had water. Great addition to 17th Ave SW!

Updated to note that got the chicken parmigiana second visit and it's even better than the spicy chicken. Stunningly delicious."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way quickly: The food is great! 

This place is off to a very good start. They've got a nice selection of sandwiches and sides. Cocktails, beer, liquours... what more do you want?

The restaurant itself looks like a modernized diner. Pretty cool if you ask me. You can tell they poured a lot of love into making sure this place looked unique, it does. 

Try the beef dip or the hot chicken sandwich. Guarantee you'll be back for me.

Bravo!"}
