{"text":"Frozen tomatoes in my turkey sandwich. When I went to complain, the lady at the register says \"tomatoes are meant to be cold!\" Then she starts getting belligerent bringing out another lady who apparently makes the sandwiches. Contesting it was frozen even though there were clearly ice particles on it. Skip this place. Food is sketchy in terms of quality and a obviously a disregard for any customer service. Never going back."}
{"text":"Located in Terminal 1 of the US departures, post-security at the Toronto Pearson International Airport; Upper Crust sells ready-made baguettes and cookies.

The bread is about 9\" with meat shavings and lots of dough.  All baguettes start at $9.59 for egg salad and vegetarian to $9.99 for turkey and ham, warmed up in a toaster oven.

Overpriced and the meat to bread radio is ridiculous.  With a bottle of soda and you will be left hungry with carb overload for $14.44 #neverAgain"}
{"text":"The croissant was good, but the lady at the counter was rude and had the personality of a cardboard box."}
{"text":"Food was OK. There's not too much expectations on airport food but it's not terrible. Food are all premade. Customer service is horrible. I asked for tea in the combo, ended up getting coffee instead. The lady handling our food seemed sick and was coughing, but she had no gloves on and no mask on whatsoever. Service is poor, food average. Recommend you go around F67 and get Tim Horton instead."}
{"text":"While waiting for a flight back home, two random women offered me a couple cookies from this concession stand as a courtesy to help hold my hunger.    The chocolate chip cookie was ok but better if warmed up.  As far as the oatmeal cookie, after eating it I said to myself that the oatmeal cookies from the grocery store taste way better than this.  The service was good but I would not eat anything from here unless it is a last resort to control your hunger while waiting for that flight back home."}
{"text":"Scrumblled eggs look so old...be careful.
I through it away and replaced with bagel and egg in it. The lady that works here agreed with me !"}
{"text":"This is pretty bad, even by airport standards. 

I got the chicken baguette - its not proper chicken... its chicken from a roll of processed chicken! 

Unfortunately this terminal doesn't have many good options"}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport 
Prices are ok 
AC is working 
Got TVs all over 
Good food 
On my way home I was just looking for a quiet place to eat lunch after getting the worst food on my flight 
There is several options at the Toronto air port 
But this one was the best for my taste 
They serve a hot chocolate 
Which really changed my day 
I ordered pizza for 6$ not bad for an air port 
The pizza was big and filled me up 
The hot chocolate was good and freshly made"}
{"text":"Baguettes, pizzas and baked pastries to feed airport passengers at YYZ (Toronto Pearson Airport) in Terminal 1, after-security (USA), Level 2 Gates, near Gate F61.

With immense frustration all the live long day our flight was extremely delayed due to the aircraft's \"maintenance issues\" which YYZ's ground crew was unable to repair the issue that ultimately we had to change planes.  My party of two were beyond livid at the situation of the aircraft.  Air Canada's flight crew instructed all passengers to discharge and wait for one hour to change planes which we grew weary, livid, angry, fury and beyond agitated.  Hunger pangs strike and we found Upper Crust.  Upper Crust offers authentic baguette sandwiches and baked pastries for on-the-go.  Service is snail turtle slow, I hazard a guess that the staff intentionally snail serve customers to miss their flights.  Food is blah and MEH- nothing extraordinary but edible to sustain us as we arrived in NYC at 9:33 pm- extremely late.  Certainly overpriced indeed as airport standards.  We selected:

one cinnamon roll CAN $3.29
two crumb raspberry Danish CAN $6.58 (total)"}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Service us horrible and slow.  Staff is more worried about chatting among themselves.   Food is nothing special.  Find someplace else."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, the baguettes are tasty and fresh. The rest of the ingredients in the sandwich don't properly fit on the roll and if you ask for your sandwich to be toasted, the tomato just mushes into the bread when you bite it. I ordered a turkey bacon club sandwich and felt like I ate mostly tomato and lettuce. It was very skimpy on the turkey and bacon."}
{"text":"Burnt coffee, greasy croissants, and terrible customer service. Find somewhere else. There are better options if you walk down a finger toward the gates."}
{"text":"We bought two pieces of pizza, one margarita and one spicy sausage.  Both slices were very tasty to the very last bite.  $6 per slice and they are very large.  We also ought a come zero bottle for $2.69.  Not bad not bad!"}
{"text":"The service was the best part of this, and it was only a bit above average.

For about 12$, you can have a soft drink and premade sandwich with very little meat. If you want your sandwich heated , it means that the tomatoes and lettuce will be heated as well.

Upper Crust benefits from being in a space where there are precious few alternatives. If you can wait to eat, maybe you should."}
{"text":"i didnt think this sandwich was bad for an airport. swiss tasted a little weird with the roast beef but other than that everything was fine. club sandiwch was ok. average airport food."}
{"text":"The Upper Crust egg bagel sandwich gave me and my husband severe food poisoning! It ruined the first 2 days of our vacation! I will never eat at this airport restaurant again. I had to give 1 star so the Post Review button became active. Really I wanted to 0/5 stars."}
{"text":"I was in desperate need for a meal while waiting to catch my flight home from Montreal.  The hubs and I stumbled upon Upper Crust in the airport and decided to grab a sandwich.  It was overpriced (as to be expected in any airport perhaps) but the lines move fast, which is what you want if you're rushing to catch your next flight.  The sandwich wasn't memorable...but then again, what airport food joint is?"}
{"text":"The food is all premade so I wasn't sure why the line was so slow. The average subway is much faster. The I ordered and realized the speed was due to terrible customer service. They don't have any flow for helping customers so orders (i.e.: heating premade baguettes) get mixed up. The woman ringing me up gave me a hard time about adding a drink to my order. 

Guess they don't need my money."}
