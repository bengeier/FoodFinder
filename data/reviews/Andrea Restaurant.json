{"text":"I do not usually like to write negative reviews, but in this case, I make an exception.  Set off on a sunny Friday to find a nice looking place across from the beautiful water and park. Made the unfortunate decision to 'play it by ear' and choose this restaurant on a whim to be a little more romantic, off-the-cuff, spontaneous, etc, etc. Here was a beautiful setting, live guitar music, and a generally pleasant appearance.  It took an awkward few moments from walking in to be seated as it was not clear what the seating policy was. Upon sitting down, I looked at the Yelp reviews - I thought \"let's not prejudice the place - who knows, right?\". Wrong!  First of all, the service was slow and disorganized. Other waiters could see we were waiting to be served and were just standing around. I understand that you are working for your tips, but surely making all the customers happy might make them more likely to return.  The menu was old and confusing - the table d'hote didn't make it clear that you had to select from the starters - obviously one selects from the mains. The rest of the menu was ill-explained (and falling to pieces).  The food was itself was dreadful. Really, no better than canteen/hospital food. I had ordered the rib, which was soggy, overcooked and presented next to a bone (that it didn't even seem to be originally attached to!), smothered in a cheap tasting gravy. The vegetables were laughable. Being described as \"roasted\", they were in fact boiled and bland and uninteresting. My wife's smoked salmon pasta was salty, overcooked, and bland again.  The 'tirimisu' helped us forget the mains, and again, was unspectacular.  In conclusion, Andrea Restaurant - watch some episodes of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares - you might learn a thing or two. Suffice to say, I won't be returning unless it has a massive overhaul. And note to myself - spontaneity is BS - plan, plan ahead!  P.S. I don't even think the guitar man was really singing..."}
{"text":"J'ai eu une bonne expérience quand je suis allée chez Andrea Restaurant. Nous n'avions pas réservé, mais le propriétaire a réussi à nous trouver une place. Nous avons bien mangé, mais la facture a été longue à recevoir à la toute fin. Nous avons attendu un certain temps. Bref, ne soyez pas pressés! :P"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised to see negative reviews of this great restaurant. I recently visited Andrea's and the entire experience was wonderful. The waiter was very personable and prompt, the atmosphere and location was amazing, and the food was tasty.   I ordered the gnocchi and was very happy with how it tasted. I had tiramisu for dessert and it too was fantastic.  If you're in the neighborhood be sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Food was meh and the service was nonchalant at best. No booster was offered for our small child, specials were not explained, staff was cold and sour, pasta was not fresh, we were not \"allowed\" to get a doggy bag for the dessert since it was \"free\", i.e included in the kid's menu or table d'hôte (wtf?!), and they complained we didn't leave a tip!"}
{"text":"I came here for here for the first time last night while looking for food with my parents and grandmother in the area...  The service was absolutely dreadful, probably the worst I've ever had. The waiter never asked if we wanted drinks, he disappeared once he took our order and we never saw him except when it was time to pay. The 4 of us ran out of water TWICE, and were without water for at least 15 min both times. They gave us bruschetta and I could have made it better with my eyes closed and my hands cut off. Yuck. We ordered the large mixed salad to share and there it was dry, literally no dressing on it. There was 2 pieces of tomatoes and 2 pieces of cucumbers... FOR 4 PEOPLE. The pasta was decent, but the portions...omg! My parents and grandmother finished their penne plates in 5 minutes and they were still hungry. They serve the pasta in these HUGE plates that make it seem like the portion is large. I got fettucine with clams and it was not bad-- the portion was pretty good. They also gave us parmesan that was already grated in a little glass bottle which I thought was really weird! Overall a horrible experience. Never going back! Save yourself the trouble and get some real italian food and service at La Campagnola in Lasalle!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Food and drinks were not very good, bland and greasy. Wont be going back!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to. First off it took 20 minutes to get seated although restaurant was virtually empty. Then another 10 for someone to come see us. We got our appetizer of calamari. It was severely undercooked. And we weren't refunded for it. Then my gnocchi tasted like dough and was undercooked. My gfs pizza tasted like a plate of salt. And the meal costed 200$ also only a bite was taken out of each plate. I've never been so angry in my life. The waitress was rude and didn't care. And the manager was way worse. I hate you Andrea whoever you are. Will never return. Even if they paid to eat here I wouldn't. So mad!"}
