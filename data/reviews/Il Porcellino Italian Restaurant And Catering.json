{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant. The staff is extremely nice and welcoming. The food is fresh and testy. Went there for lunch and got the Porcellino salad."}
{"text":"This is mine and my boyfriend's favourite Italian restaurant! The food is always delicious, from their gnocchi to the Porcellino salad. They also start you with their homemade spicy oil, plus bread and butter, which is amazing and they actually have for purchase. We always have at least two bottle in our house.  The best part about this restaurant is definitely the people. This place is family run so everyone is always very friendly and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation. Very disappointing. Veal was not good! Breading and sauce were not good. Tasted as though it had been frozen and thawed. Sauce was watery And weak. Soup was good. The addition of spicy oil was not needed. My colleague had the same dish and just looked at me and shook his head, I hope it's a bad day here. We should have known since it was lunch and the place was not very busy."}
{"text":"Wow this place was amazing!!!! The owners where very hospitable and welcoming.When I travel these are the types of places you wish to find.Portions are spot on and the fettuccini with meat sauce was to die for.You must give this place a try .Even though it doesn't have a lot of reviews this place won't dissapoint!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Mississauga, $20 three course lunch menu are quick and delicious.  Must try the house made spicy oil. $10 a bottle to take home with you."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been a few times and the food is always good and staffs are very friendly and personable. I've tried the Porcellino Salad, Spaghetti alla Bolognese which reminds me of my grandma's sauce :-) and the Gnocchi with rose sauce which was delicious!"}
{"text":"The service is phenomenal!!! Would totally recommend to anyone in the area for lunch! I just wish they were open for dinner too!  The mushroom ravioli Alfredo is to die for - must have!  The veal parm can I even begin to describe?!?!   I just recently moved back from NYC and must say I'm upset that I didn't know about this hidden gem before - a must if you love Italian food!"}
{"text":"This great little family owned restaurant is a gem. It has been my son's favourite place to come for pasta since he was a little boy. They are only open on weekdays for lunch as they are in an industrial area, so we would always come when my son had a PD day at school. When I asked my son where he wanted his birthday dinner, he picked Il Porcellino......so we came for lunch instead. We started with the tomato salad which was tasty...like bruschetta topping. The juice at the bottom of the salad was used to dip the bread in. My son, hubby and mom all enjoyed their penne ala vodka. I had the gf fettuccine in arrabiata sauce...dang it was spicy but soooo good. The fam enjoyed a delicious peach san pallegrino...I had water. They loved the home made spicy oil.  The owner is so sweet and genuine and comes to talk to everybody. He gave my son a home made cannoli for his bday."}
{"text":"I use to go here all the time when I worked nearby.  Their Penne A La Vodka, Penne with grilled veggies are amazing.  The family owned restaurant gives you that personal welcome.  The chef always going out of his way to personalize my order.    You cant go wrong with anything you order.  Also tried thier pizzas, shrimps, garlic bread, soup and chicken parmesian."}
{"text":"Not much to say. Service was slow in the beginning although there were no other customers. My dish was not impressive at all. Chicken had a strong chicken taste and pasta was dry and bland. I kept having to use the dry pepper flakes and parmesan cheese. It would have been nice if they offered fresh parmesan. On the menu it said the chicken came with a side of penne and rapini. Where was the rapini? Confused. I am only giving them an extra star because it is family owned I believe and I feel bad."}
