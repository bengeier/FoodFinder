{"text":"not good all the food has no flavour. Crispy beef is soggy with no flavour at all, pad thai is awful again not an ounce of flavour and i'm pretty sure they don't know what thai style curries are because that is not what I was served at all. We will not order from here again."}
{"text":"not good all the food has no flavour!!. Crispy beef is soggy with no flavour at all, the lettuce and bean sprouts in our vermicelli were all brown and rotten, pad thai is awful not an ounce of flavour and i'm pretty sure they don't know what thai style curries are because that is not what I was served at all. We will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Food is ordered quick, comes in a flash!  Pho broth is delicious and pad Thai is spot on! Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"3.5/5!  I LOOOOOOVE pho! It's a mad real craving and I don't always have it so when I do, I'm critical about everything. I went with an old friend to catch up and frankly, my rating is best more on her dish than mine.   We went for lunch around noon and both order the Special 99 beef soup which comes as the broth with all types of beef (brisket, tendons, meatballs, strips, etc), tripe, and noodles. It was nice and warm, very filling and adding Sriracha really cleared up my sinuses (suffering from a cold at the moment lol).   My friend ordered the exact same dish but had asked for no onions. I don't know if they interpreted that in a different way but they didn't give her onions (good) but they also didn't give her any of the meatballs or tripe. She still enjoyed it but felt a bit jipped. I took out the tendons from my bowl when it came but that's just preference. Also, I actually haven't tried pho anywhere other than pho mi 99 so next time I'll definitely expand my horizons.   We both got medium sized bowls and all together with tax was $14.39 (a little under $8 each) which I think is pretty good considering the quality and quantity you get.   Definitely recommend, I'll be trying their fish balls and shrimp bowl next time :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars very good option for a quick meal. I go there everytime to have quick dinner when I have to OT before I go back home.   broth is good, service is quick, reasonable price, meat is ok but cant complain with the price they charge  overall Not bad  wonderful option if you want to have quick meal"}
{"text":"I used to come here often, until I received the worst service I had EVER experienced. Young, feminine-looking Asian boy behind the cash register counter with an unbelievably disgusting attitude. He is in dire need of some common curtesy, for customer service skills are far beyond his capabilities. He did not know what my table ordered and scoffed when I tried to describe the dishes (I'm not Vietnamese). From there, obviously, tipping was out of the question. There were a bit more to the situation, I will not waste my time recalling.   I do not like wasting my time writing negative reviews, but this incident in particular was of a disturbance to me. I highly discourage anyone from going to this place, for there are quite a few other restaurants within the area for Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"my go to place for pho!   Service and food is usually good! Even parking isn't the worst but you know it could be always better!  Nothing more satisfying than sharing a bowl of pho, deep fried spring rolls and iced viet coffee :)"}
{"text":"Well first off let me say its been open for a while now when most of the stuff around there has all changed and new stores come and go. The restaurant is very plain looking and not spectacular and was built around 10 years ago and nothings really changed. BUT ITS STILL THERE! for a good reason...  ;)  Mostly because the food is really awesome as there are over a 100 things on the menu to choose from. Which is also great if you're going with slightly picky foodies so they'll find something deliciously edible to eat.  Another great fact is the food is well priced and the portions are pretty giant per person. Usually my friends and I order different plates and all share. Its also great if you want to share with someone on a dinner date.  I end up always taking half of my meal to go if I order my own plate. It can get busy on holidays and weekends... personally I have never had a waiting problem as the place has a general flow, someone is always coming and another is always going.  Personally my favorites are the soups as they come in really large bowls with lots of ingredients and are great on a cold day. I love the rich and bold flavours that you cannot simply get from most restaurants when you get a soup craving.   So yea! I would definitely say check it out if you haven't, but like I said before don't expect it to be amazing looking. Its not a fancy place but more of a casual hang out. Not the kind of place you'd take a girl on a date to impress her.... but for people in a relationship deff a good place to have a dinner date!"}
{"text":"Found the food a bit better than the average Pho place. Service could be stronger. Thai options available. Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent spicy tom yum here! Tried my partners pho which was also fantastic! Definitely would visit here again."}
{"text":"Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting!  There was a 2x3 cm long rusty screw in my boyfriends vermicelli bowl. Their excuse was it flew off the knife they were using. I usually love going for Pho but I lost my appetite right after. They replaced the vermicelli bowl with a new one but I am sure my boyfriend will never go to another Pho Mi 99 ever again.  I should also add on how the decor was very gloomy. The menu looks like it's never been cleaned/wiped. The utensils were dirty and the staffs had very dirty and stained cloths.  The dirtiest Pho Mi 99 in Mississauga. Compared to this the one in Heartland is the cleanest. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The pho wasnt good. I ordered it with spicy satay flavour, the soup/broth wasnt spicy and was bland. The portion of beef they give you is really small comparing to the amount of noodles you get."}
{"text":"Excellent vietnamien comme on trouve,hélas, pas souvent à Montréal. Fraîcheur, goût et parfums sont au rendez-vous.  Nous recommandons à 100%"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner last night. A few of my thoughts/observations:  1) I ordered Pho (#205) and it was really tasty.  2) The large Pho is truly a large bowl of noodles. Don't be a tough guy and order a large unless you're really hungry and/or a big eater.  3) The place was full of people...Asian people. This is a good thing. If there are no Asians eating at a an Asian restaurant, it probably sucks.   4) Game 5 of the Leafs-Bruins was playing on a pretty nice TV, which was cool. Is there anything more Canadian than eating noodles while watching playoff hockey?? Hell no!   All in all, a good Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga. If you're at Square One and don't feel like New York Fries for dinner, check this place out (assuming you're driving because it's kinda far to walk. But hey, it's Mississauga, so you're probably driving an SUV right?)"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out today, we found a huge piece of PAPER TOWEL in our beef briskets noodle soup!!!It was so disgusting!!!!! I don't know how they passed the food safety!!! I will NEVER go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried all the phos. This is da best!  Owner was a cook in restaurants for years.  Bun Bo Huè is legit best in GTA. 440  Their tendon is premium, slow-cooked in a pressure cooker so it's soft jelly not that gristle garbage they sell elsewhere. 207 or 217  I also like their chicken broth soup w wontons. 107 when I have a cold.  I come all the time for lunch so they like me. Service varies everywhere. But good food is what I'm here to eat."}
{"text":"Pho-Mi 99 is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant for pho.  This restaurant is really popular. It can get really busy during peak lunch and dinner hours, but the service is usually quick.  The deep fried spring rolls are the best. I love the taro in their spring rolls, and they are consistently crispy... It shows that they are always fried to order.   I always order a beef noodle soup, and a lot of times \"with Thai soup\" ($1 extra). This way, I get my spicy Thai soup and still be able to select the size I want. The soup is always steaming hot which I love, especially on a chilly night. The beansprouts are usually fresh and you can ask them to boil them before serving, too.  Occasionally, my boyfriend orders a rice dish, like their grilled chicken and pork with fried egg on rice. The meats are usually quite tasty and they give you a whole bowl of rice.   Their avocado shake is pretty good too."}
{"text":"We go here all the time. Its clean, cheap, fast and it taste's decent. It's a little on the fatty side but no more than other pho places I have gone to in the area. At the end of the day this isnt fine dining but it's non pretentious food that is easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled for Pho because there are many great Vietnamese places downtown and this is my first venture up north. I didn't like this place. I had the beef pho and the meat was 60% fat and gristle. The broth was very greasy and the fresh veggies (bean sprouts and basil)  were far from fresh. If you know good Pho give this place a pass."}
{"text":"Great pho restaurant, reasonably priced and large portions, service is fast and place is conveniently located. Great place for a casual pho lunch!"}
{"text":"Fast and cheap! When on a time crunch and you have a little less than 1 hr to eat and socialize,  this is the spot.   All the pho dishes are great. If you want to switch it up, I recommend the goat curry on rice. Deeeliiciouss!   If not into goat (who's not into goat lol) try the chicken fried rice with bbq chicken.  All dishes are well under $10 with tax and tip  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the fastest restaurant serving tasty real food with tons of value compared to fast food chain selling fake food. Lunch hours are packed with people tho."}
{"text":"A great place to get PHO that is right next to Vaughn Mills. Lots to choose from the menu, I got a medium sized, well done beef pho. It came with a generous portion of noodle and beef and the soup was tasty. I also got a portion of dough fritter, which was amazing, crunchy and light!  The service was fast and effective. The location doesn't have a fancy decor but it's clean enough.   The prices were quite reasonable, about $8 for a bowl. Do keep in mind that the portions are generous, so only order the large if you are really really hungry.  Overall, a great place to go if you just want some simple pho!"}
{"text":"Best phó in Northern America as far as I'm concern!  We stopped there while crossing Canada, on our way to Montréal to get a phó and still remember it more than a year later. We then crossed back to California driving south and we haven't found any place that was as good.   If you're around and look for a good phó place, this is the one !"}
{"text":"Great spot and such yummy soups!!! Perfect meal or snack after a hard afternoon of shopping at the outlet malls and you can't beat the prices"}
{"text":"Just terrible We ordered take out and found a cigarette bud and filter in our chicken satay   I would give this place a zero but it won't let me post  Eff those dirty pricks   Pic attached"}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 has the worst service I have ever been to. The waitress was not welcoming and when my boyfriend and I wrote our order down on paper, she could not differentiate the number 7 and the letter T. When she asked if we wrote T, we clearly said no, its number 7. So she left and came back after some time with the wrong order and said it's order #T08 instead of #708. She then accused us of saying that we told her T. We also had a \"Take-out\" order where the letter T was clearly written on it.   We also asked for iced water and she came back with just water. We don't need or expect people in the service industry to say hi with a big smile or pretend to be interested in how we're doing... just don't accuse the customer of your error. If she just had corrected it without those comments, that would've been the end of that. We're never coming back here again because of poor service."}
{"text":"Went there on the way to airport for my flight. Pretty busy place. Noodles were fresh,  and soup was very good. The fried shrimp cake was not very good. Too much dough  not enough shrimp.    The portions were huge. I paid for extra meat but need not have.  This is the first pho place where I ended up leaving a lot of soup and noodles unfinished.  Should have ordered the small size instead of large Will visit again."}
{"text":"This place is just like any other pho places, nothing really special.  I have been here a couple of times and yesterday's experience was pretty disappointing.  Yesterday, I came here with my family for dinner and the broth of the pho was so plain and tasteless.  In comparison to my other visits before, Pho Mi 99 was better before than yesterday's visit I made.  However, one good thing is the spring rolls - it pretty much remained the good tasting spring rolls I had before!    While for the service itself, when my family and I arrived, the restaurant wasn't so busy and there were plenty of seats.  However, after being seated for 5 minutes +, I haven't even had any tea given to my table until I passed on my order to one of the waitresses, which was pretty long for them to notice that I had no drinks once I sat down.      The food arrived pretty quickly as soon as my order was placed, so nothing to complain about that here.    However, what made this visit more disappointing was the fact that when I headed up to the cashier, the woman (I believe she is the owner), she was extremely rude when I told her I wanted to pay my bill, she still ignored me and just didn't seem to care that I was standing in front wanting to pay my bill and leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the waitresses are not so much.  There is no sense of customer service.  Lack of presentation and Communication skills."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years now.  Loved it at first, then quality started going down hill in 2013.  But came back in March 2014 to give it another try and found the quality and taste was back on track!  Been coming here a few times a month and been consistently pleased with the pho I've gotten (#220, baby!).  Spring rolls have also been hot and fresh every time since.  Great portions - lots of meat and soup does not taste watered down.  I'm a fan again!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what happened to this place.  but its been a steady decline for me and a lot of people I know  This place USED to be packed.  line ups to get in... and now--- you can pick any seat you'd like really.    The food is definitely not what it used to be-  im a huge fan of viet food-  never had a bad meal really-  but for some reason this place never satisfies anymore.  lettuce soggy and sorry looking in my vermicelli dish and the spring rolls were cold (and I DIDNT order the cold rolls)  Hit the Pho 99 on Latimer in Mississauga-  always packed- always fast-  always hot and piping.  never a bad meal there  this location is worth skipping."}
{"text":"Quick and fast service. Had lunch here. Lots of seating. Family owned and operated.  I had the chicken cashew with sautéed vegetable. Can't complain.  Dish was served boiling hot. Loved it.   Also a kettle of green tea is services to you on house as you are seated."}
{"text":"My family are pretty much regulars here. This location is probably one of the better ones in terms of service/quality. This place is pretty much an all-arounder, they obviously specialize in Pho, but their Rice/Vermicelli/etc dishes are pretty good too.   The family dinners (We normally get the Dinner for 4) are a combination of super good dishes and the Sour soup (Canh Chua) is lovely! Of the numbers of places we try it, this location makes this soup very well. The staple dish, Pho is almost always on point - it has it's off days, ie. slightly overcooked noodles, etc.   As for service, let's remember that this is an Asian setting. Most Asian places don't focus nor care about service, not unless is geared towards the more upper-class (and prices too, duh). There will be times/days where you will feel the service is meh in comparison to N. American-styled places especially during rushes, that's common almost anywhere. But on off-peak times, I noticed the employees really try to interact and serve to the best of their ability. English is obviously not their first language, but they really make an effort to be friendly, etc."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. If you're in Vaughan Mills area this is the place to go for a nice Pho soup. They serve a bunch of other dishes but when we're there I go for \"203\". Staff is friendly and although the restaurant is outdated, it's very clean."}
{"text":"OMG . wow,, you will get addicted to this place. they have amazing food, lots and lots of food to choose from in their huge menu. make sure you know what's inside your food when you're ordering maybe its not something that goes with your taste, like the specialty foods ( only for those who regularly eat them). the fried rice with all three meats is great! and the satay thai soup is amazing, its too much that you can even share one. amazing staff, pretty fast service as well. been going there almost every week now since 2months ago."}
{"text":"Decent pho the last time we were here. Food looks better than it tastes.   Unfortunately broth doesn't even do it for me here. The pho was tasteless - water. The optional hoisin and Sriracha were mandatory this visit. Biggest peeve - rare beef coming out over cooked. Beef balls tasted like they are to expire today.   As for the bun bo hue - nothing worst than cold pork blood which was obviously just dropped into not hot enough soup.   The restaurant is run by vietnamese people which can be rare but also makes it inexcusable. Service is quick which makes sense why our table smells like damp towel...yuck. I'm embarrassed to be a regular check in here.  Also $27 for 2 before tip?! If I could review less than I star I would."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place honestly the food was really good I had the beef and onions with rice and an avacodo shake. It was very good but the service not so great my server seemed annoyed and  the menu is a little over whelming. The 3 stars is for the food for service I would give it no stars."}
{"text":"The food was good but we experienced the worst customer service ever! We came to this restaurant excited because we didn't think we can eat pho visiting Canada. As Vietnamese Americans, we were eager to get to meet with Vietnamese people in Canada land. When we entered, we spoke to them in Vietnamese as a friendly gesture and they acted like they don't understand and started speaking English. Then we overheard them speaking to each other in Vietnamese and we thought they were just trying to be professional. It's all alright. We're new here so we were waiting for the waitress to come over to take orders. When we told them we were ready, the girl said nothing then pointed us at a piece of paper on the table and walked away. We learned that to order we had to write what we want on there and gave it to them. It's still alright. The rude part came when the waiter served us and knocked over my cup of tea. The tea was spilled all over the table, but he said nothing, leaving the dish on the table and walked away. It's not about the accident but how he responded to that. NO APOLOGY! He didn't even come back to clean it. The second waiter came over to serve my husband and we had to ask him to clean it. The second guy was nice and he just did it without complaining. Since I was disrespected, I planned to talk to the owner later. My husband said \" We got good food so just let this go\". I agreed with him. When we came to the counter to pay, the owner was there. We thought since he's old, he would be wiser and more reasonable. We said hi in Vietnamese but he didn't even acknowledge us and just handed us the bill. We thought he could be busy so patiently we waited. When he's done, he waved my husband over (the way you called a kid over).  In US, we paid by giving the cashier the card so that's what we did. He refused to say anything but pointed us at the machine and gestured us how to swipe our card like we are two dumb people standing in front of him. He didn't even wait for the receipt to come out. He just walked away. We were baffled. Later the girl came over and handed us our receipt.  We were speechless! They had given us a very bad impression of Vietnamese Canadians. We were too shocked to try any other Vietnamese restaurant there. We went to countless Vietnamese restaurants in US and we were never treated this bad."}
{"text":"they serve the food very fast~!! Noodles are just fine. You can try the Thai style Hot pot( Sorry I dont really remeber the name of the dish) this is my favorite one!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed. Ordered pho it arrived without the bean sprout plate which never made it to the table. The spring rolls were dripping with oil, I mean clear, greasy oil. I can be critical sometimes but I hate paying for disappointments. I just can't let go of the greasy spring roll, terrible!"}
{"text":"Service is always super fast. The food is nothing to write home about though. Not exceptional but not horrible either."}
{"text":"UNFORTUNATELY this is NOT the first time that they shorted us on our paid order! Once, could have been a mistake. Twice? Shameful! Pitty, as it used to be OK and we have been enjoying their Pho for many years.  We ordered  no107, which is won ton egg noodle soup. came without the bean sprouts, limes, mint, any and all sauces. Last time we ordered extra meet as well, and that hasn't arrived either as well as all of the crunchy accompaniments. Pad Thai crappy! OK, I know! we should never order Thai from Vietnamese places but Oh, well. Live and learn!  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"We hit this place at about 9:30pm on a Tuesday. The hours say they close at 10pm. However, there were still customers filing in. We ordered the 99 special noodles, grilled pork and chicken rice, and deep fried butter frog legs. All the dishes were great. The frog legs were a bit bland. Service was awesome. Total was about $25. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here alllllll my life ! ever since I was 2 we would go here every weekend and I find the pho mi 99 company/brand/franchise to be inconsistent. This location I find the female workers to be snooty and not very friendly, the food is below average, and sometimes the tables are a tad sticky ): ew  I ordered the spring rolls here and you could tell they were reheated from frozen, the soup didn't have good pieces of meat they were all cartilage and it was gross, the rice and pork chop and chicken steak were also very chewy, so I'm sad to say that I would never return to this location. I recommend the one on Latimer, in Heartland Town Center the food and service their is great !"}
{"text":"I'm not a pho kinda guy so my review is in respect to their grilled pork and chicken that I always order and that is always bomb (Ya I dropped the \"the\" in \"the bomb\" and now it's just more current :D)  Anyway, the space is clean, bright and the servers are always attentive. I highly recommend this place If you're in the area and craving Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 has amazing food and even better service, if you're looking for a quick and inexpensive meal this is the place to go. If you order a soup on a somewhat quiet day, it will be out within a couple minutes. Familiar faces and food that will never get old, great restaurant"}
{"text":"Quite a decent place and the pho was better then expected. The vermicelli noodles were also quite delicious. Place was pretty crowded considering it was a weekday night.   Would love to be back and try something different next time"}
{"text":"PHO MI 99 is the very definition of a diamond-in-the-rough restaurant. It looks like a place that you'd pass by, as the interior isn't really up-to-date and the place is clean but you know it has never seen a renovation.   Those reservations end as soon as you sit down and open a menu. There are LITERALLY more than a thousand food options; it's mind boggling that they can serve this stuff without an army of cooks. Needless to say, after coming here a few times I've settle on some key favorites to avoid waiting to gorge myself.   No matter what I get though, I will always douse it in sauce: the Hoisin and Hot variety. It makes every meal (including soups) so tangy and full of flavor that I can't wait to come back! The service is quick and to the point, no small talk ...ever. The staff usually speaks enough English to let them take your order and move on, nothing fancy.   The prices are super-affordable ...like you can stuff your face with all the different foods + appetizer for under $10. Literally no way to go wrong with that.   TL;DR: Amazing food, décor is meh, but you're here for the food anyways, so eat up!"}
{"text":"I've had great pho, and I've had horrible pho before in places around the world. This place? It rates below average. This is nothing even remotely close to what you can get at an average place in California.  The only thing positive about this place? It looks nice and clean.  We ordered, in our group, the pho, bun bo hue (beef rice noodle, central Vietnam style), and banh cuon (rice flour wraps).  First off the pho, which is supposed to be its staple dish, I ordered the special with everything. Where's the beef? (I feel like an old Wendy's commercial) I ordered the extra large, and the total scantily pieces of meat were less than small bowls I would get in other places. Next, the broth was like slightly flavoured water. That was not pho broth. Pho broth is supposed to be flavorful. I might as well pour water with some rice noodles and add a few tiny slices of meat to make something that would taste the same.  Next, I will just group the Bun Bo Hue and Banh Cuon together. They are just flavourless. They lack in meat, and they lack in flavor. The broth, once again, tasted more like water than what it is supposed to taste like.  As for service? Well, they kept forgetting my coffee drink I ordered; they did not bring out the veggies until we reminded them; and they really appear indifferent. They were not rude, so that saved them from a 1-star review. But as far as food goes? Look elsewhere if you want authentic, good tasting food."}
{"text":"I feel like I never learn my lesson. I went to the Mississauga Pho Mi 99, and figured that the Vaughan location would have a different chef and a different experience. Boy, was I wrong.  Although this location was slightly better than its counterpart in Mississauga, they are still very unsatisfactory.  I tried the large bowl of pho again, and once again, I was very disappointed. The first sign of trouble came when they brought out the lime and beansprouts. The lime was cut very small, and it was dry. I could not squeeze any juices out of it. Next came my large bowl of pho. I thought it was deja vu. I saw a lot of broth, a bit of rice noodles, and barely any meat. I rationed my meat throughout the meal to try finish everything, but by the time I finished the meat, there was still plenty of noodles and broth left. That is very unsatisfying when considering I rationed and took in smaller portions of meat in each bite to accommodate. And the broth? Although slightly better than Mississauga Pho Mi 99, slightly better than water is still very lacking in flavor. Pho broth should be flavorful, not taste like water.  My friends tried the rice dishes this time, and they said it was average at best (meaning, it was not very good). Yes, this place is clean and nice looking, but no, good decoration does not equate to good food."}
{"text":"The first times I had the chicken pad Thai it was really good. I've now been to this location for chicken pad Thai twice since then and the pad Thai was absolutely disgusting. I don't know if they have a new cook but but pad Thai completely different. No flavor and no chicken or vegetables. Just horrible."}
{"text":"Love the pad thai here. I've come many times and enjoy it always. I'm a big fan of the Vietnamese coffee which is divine. Prices have gone up a bit but i would still go."}
{"text":"This location is one of the best standing out of all of the Pho-Mi 99 location. The reason: it is running by original Pho-Mi 99 owner and they care for their food. Price is one of the very important thing. Secondly, the menu is quiet varieties, you can choose between Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai food. It is a good place for family and quick lunch. I give it 3/5 because of the service relate and the quality of food."}
{"text":"No 422. grilled chicken, spring roll, vermicelli   perfect thin vermicelli, served at the right temperature, chicken served hot to a  complement of cool vegetables liken to the McD.L.T. but Viet stylez. :)  Inside the restaurant, it's nothing to write home about. But if you like ordering the bun ga nuong they do this dish justice. One of the best I've had.   Recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped by with a coworker for lunch. They provided speedy service, great food and large portions."}
{"text":"It seems like everytime I go there they are mopping up the restaurant and you can smell the nasty dirty mop smell as you eat the pho. After this happened multiple times I decided to stop going despite the good pho."}
{"text":"I love this pho mi 99 location! I'm a regular here lol Servers remember me by name and always have a smile on their face. The food is consistently delicious! I always order the deep fried spring rolls with a bowl of pho (#203). I have brought many of my friends here and they always return with other friends :P that's how good this place is! I'm sad that they raised the prices but i still come back for their pho and service. They have many other good dishes like their chicken wings, calamari, pad Thai, vermicelli, crispy noodles with seafood, noodles with beef, the list can go on and on! A must try!!!!! You won't regret it =]"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to try Pho. Boy was I disappointed. The service is terrible, no one even bothers to come to your table after 10 minutes and I ended up having to call someone from the counter and he just gave me a slip and left. Not a word was spoken. The waiters were busy talking among themselves and I took another 5 minutes for them to take my order.  The food arrived quickly though. I'm guessing it was prepared before hand and they just heat it up and bring it to your table. The food was below average. Once finished the food, I waited to see how long before they would present the bill. I waited for more than 15 minutes and had to call them waiters again to give me the bill. I left the place in a hurry and never ever going back there again. Please save your time and money and pick any other Pho place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this chain for over ten years. The food is always good. However, at this location it was awful. I was told they got new management before I left. I ordered a drink with tapioca bubbles. Half way through the drink I realized no more bubbles were coming up and instead I had a huge clump of them in my drink. It wasn't a problem, I was just going to ask for a new one. It wasn't until when I asked for a new one our server told us to talk to the manager. It took us 3 waiters and 10 minutes later (keep in mind they were not busy at the time at all, with two servers standing and talking to each other for a while) to get the manager to come over. When he did he was very arrogant, didn't act like he cared about my concern and his reply was \" so did you just want to complain or another drink? What do you want?\". He took the drink and returned and said \"im not making you a new one, ill just take it off your bill\" and walks away. Honestly, I've never been treated that way before by any waiter. Our server wasn't great by any means, but a nice guy. I told my server that his manager needed to fix his attitude before telling him I'd never be returning."}
{"text":"What an awful little plaza. There's a giant Chinese buffet and a bunch of little shit convenience stores, but this place was pretty good.  Staff was super friendly, the pho and bun were both passable (spring rolls on bun not great...extra fried, less delicious vegetable filling), and they have those giant hot plates for cooking pho and beef right at your table if you're in a party of 3 or 4. That looked like a lot of fun.   Quite inexpensive and quick."}
{"text":"So.....went a couple weeks ago and there's a conditional pass from the food police on the window.  Seems there has been some sort of cleanliness/contamination violation. Yikes!  Hopefully this is something they take seriously or I won't be back. Diners beware!  Update, they got their pass back.  Back on the wagon :-)"}
{"text":"This is a new place in a relatively newly built plaza. The place wasn't difficult to find, yet being a new place, they strangely did not have their restaurant sign light turned on at night.  The place is relatively spacey and clean, but the atmosphere wasn't to my liking, kind of felt like I was in a kitchen. Went in with a friend and waited to be seated. Instead of being seated, the cashier/bar lady at the back just gestured to pick a seat by waving us away. No greet of any kind, no smile, just told us to sit pretty much.  I ordered Pho Dac Biet. I actually forgot to write down the size, yet the server didn't clear it up with me what size I actually wanted. I am not picky, but I notice details such as how the server (the manager actually) gave me the pho before giving the beansprouts/lemon/spice dish. Not too big of a deal, but what was a big deal was the soup was not hot, more like warm at best. The meat portions were not note-worthy for a new place where you expect to be \"enticed\" to come back for more. However, the taste was decent. My friend ordered vermicelli with bbq pork and spring rolls, the pork was great, but the spring rolls were mediocre. The vermicelli was also really really cold according to my friend.  All in all, an ok place, but some aspects of a restaurant are considerably lacking, especially considering that its a new restaurant."}
{"text":"You looking for flavourful & authentic Vietnamese food? Do your stomach & wallet a solid and go down the street to 'I Love Pho.'   The service here sucked. My boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant with a older gentleman (I'm assuming may be the owner) walked right past us and didn't greet us or acknowledge us. Soon to have his back turned against us and then asked for how many people. Not to mention, we had to ask for our tea & cups...   This place had the oiliest pho soup I have ever seen. After finishing your \"so-called\" pho, you could see rings of fat & oil clinging to the side of the bowl...   My Banh Uot W/ Cha #9 arrived looking plentiful and filling. The noodle component was nice and steamy! However, I have never had cha (Vietnamese sausage) that was grainy & taste so off ever! Their fish sauce lacked flavour as if it was watered down.   Never visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Don't plan to return here. Service is awful. First there was a delay in my order. They brought my boyfriend's dish right away but mine didn't come out for so long I had to ask about it. My boyfriend was over half way finished his dish by the time mine was available. The second issue is I found a shimp shell in my order. Which would be fine if I ordered seafood which I didn't. I order Pho which in my whole life never came with a shimp shell. Overall like many other reviews the food is average. But with service and quality like this, I wouldn't recommend. There is a much better Viet place in the same plaza (a few doors down from the Chatime)."}
{"text":"Good food. Super fast and friendly service. Fair prices. Family of 4 who goes often."}
{"text":"Every year I come back to this location and its always a disappointment  . In the past I have found a hair on a spring roll, little meat in there pho compared to their other location . This time I ordered a beef stew it had a lot of nerves and very little meat. Noodles were overcooked .  They even forgot to give me the free tea. Also ordered a crispy spring roll and that was great. I will take a little extra time and keep going to their other location on  Latimer. Will never come back here."}
{"text":"So good for so little money. I am so stuffed."}
{"text":"all there Pho are great. But if you like it hot try there Tom-Yum Seafood & Vermicelli soup  T09. Its so good.  This place is clean service is super fast and great."}
{"text":"Foods are just ok, but both my husband and I like the bubble tea here, he even said bubble tea here is much better than chatime's"}
{"text":"I had the pho beef special which was pretty good but the chicken pad thai was a bit mediocre. The service was very fast and the food arrived quickly. The food was well priced and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"The food is always too salty. You can see a  thick layer of oil on the curry. A fried egg costs you TWO dollars. A bowl of rice costs you TWO dollars. Staff comes around right after you finish and looks like they just want to kick you out."}
{"text":"I' ve been to all the Pho MI 99, in Mississauga...I must say that this location as the worst service and poorly cooked grilled meat. Their soup broth is a hit or miss, if you order the soup later in the day, the broth seems bland and watered down. I have decided not to go back to this location for my Vietnamese fix."}
{"text":"Average vietnamese food and price. If u r hungry in the area it's a good visit.   Definitely would prefer this over the food court in Vaughn mills."}
{"text":"I've been travelling for a week now in Mississauga and so far this is my favourite place for dinner. The service was excellent and the fried rice with beef was delicious. And it was very reasonably priced.  I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 is my usual Pho spot in Mississauga - great service and food.  Unfortunately, last night there was something in the air (maybe the it was gloomy weather) because service was awful.  My friend and I walked in, got a table, 10 minutes later they finally stopped to pick up our order.  The food arrived promptly BUT they forgot about spring rolls.  We sat and ate our mains thinking the spring rolls would arrive but nothing.  We had to get the attention of our server to check on the spring rolls and they FINALLY arrived at the end of our meal.  We both were full at this point but finished our spring rolls.  The food was yummy, my friend enjoyed her Pho and I had my usual Grilled Chicken Vermicelli.  If you are in the Square One area, drop by just hope service better when you visit!"}
{"text":"Pho-Mi 99 is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga.  Great portions, awesome food and fabulous service.  I am craving to go back.  Their grilled chicken vermicelli is absolutely delish.  Be sure to get there early for Friday lunches - the place gets packed around noon.  I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Went here during the week with my extended family.  Was not impressed with the food or service.  My pad Thai came out too spicy (I love heat but it was at the point where it was not enjoyable to eat).  My jackfruit shake was good, but so tiny for the price.  The staff overall was very rude.  \"Move move move\" is not acceptable.   A simple \"excuse me\" would have worked.  We will not be returning to this location and will stick to our usual Pho Saigon in Brampton where service is great and fast, and food is tasty and less pricey."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very fast service. There were several tables that came in around the same time as us, but we were able to place our orders in right away and get the food within minutes of ordering! We only ordered the pho noodles, very tasty meat and broth! Pricing was very good, only $5.50 for a small and $6.50 for a medium! Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food..... but the menu is huge and overwhelming."}
{"text":"This place is always bustling! The food is delicious and the menu has variety. Service is fast and efficient and the price point is reasonable. Not a fancy restaurant but if you like exploring off the beaten path their Pho may just be your next favorite!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location in years, but once I saw the signage, I ran in like a fat boy going for the buffet table.  I was in the area attending a job fair and was looking for something different, and our group decided to go for pho. While I've visited other locations in the Pho Mi chain, it had been a long while since I'd visited one. I remembered that the food was really good the last time I came here, which spurred on my decision to revisit.  When I go for pho, I always get chicken/pork vermicelli with a spring roll. No exceptions. With that in mind, the quality was about the same as I'd expect at any other location in the city. Solid if unspectacular spring roll, massive portion sizes, lots of veggies to mix in with the noodles... just solid all around.  I recognize that these Vietnamese restaurants run a tight ship and like to get customers in and out relatively quickly, especially when there's a lineup. Seeing the staff wheeling around cleaning carts didn't bother me at all compared to some of the others with me. The only real bad part of the experience - and it wasn't even bad, just weird - was our server asking me if I've ever eaten vermicelli before and if I knew what I was ordering. Bruh, I've been eating pho for more than a decade. I know that it's pork skin. I can't tell if he looked at me and thought I was some kind of neophyte or what.  Regardless, this is a solid destination if you're looking for food. The service is a bit cold and clinical, the restaurant is clean but unremarkable and the presentation doesn't exactly wow me, but I know exactly what I'll get when I come in and the price ($8-9) is just right.  Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Conveniently close to Vaughn Mills, quick service and reasonable price compared to food court.  Bun Bo Hue - 3/5 Broth is quite good and lots of fresh red cabbage. There's pork and beef and also the pig blood pudding for authenticity. The flavour is good but the noodles were overcooked so they were choppy.  Special Pho - 2/5 Soup is not too flavourful, not too much meat for the size. I've had better pho from other places.  Spring Rolls - 3.5/5 Crispy but looks a bit greasy. A little spicy from the black pepper in the filling. Would prefer to have more lettuce and pickles on the side.  Overall it's a decent restarant, typical pho, but probably not worth driving all the way over here just to try a bowl."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it's pretty good. Just your standard pho, nothing special. The price is pretty average as well. The place is big so seating isn't an issue. I really enjoyed the fresh spring rolls here. They take debit which is a plus! I'd go here again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Went there on a weekday at 5 pm. Me and my husband was the only ones dining. The couches were ripped and the interior just didn't look as good as before. We got our pho and fried rice, which was clearly not fresh and tasted awful like they warmed up your chicken fried rice.   No wonder there's no one eating inside. Never going back again"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins and they had the pho. Good pho. I wanted something i never had before because im from seattle (pho central) so i ordered the Mi Quang. it was actually pretty decent i enjoyed it very much. The broth could use a little less msg but im sure people dont mind. It tasted good. The rice crackers that came with it were great! They were the thicker ones so they didnt get soggy too fast and stayed crunchy. Love it. Didn't get a chance to try the spring rolls, they did not look too appetizing because i could tell they werent freshly wrapped. The rice paper looked dried out and thick. oh well, the soups were good."}
{"text":"A ok! Disgusted with the dirty dish trolley parked next to me as I was eating, idea - bring the dishes to the cart not the cart to the dishes (never will go back its disgusting and lost my appetite)."}
{"text":"Yet another Vietnamese place which hits the spot but is just like any other place.    Food 3/5 but one more star for service and cleanliness.   The service is very friendly and quick. The menu is reasonably priced and has quite a lot of choices to choose from. The awesome thing was the place was very clean and that's why I gave them one more star.  I had the fried fish with egg and rice. Which was average and did the job at lunch time. The food was done up nicely.  Over all this is not a bad option in any way and good was a quick meal but not the best meal of your life."}
{"text":"Decided to go here because we were shopping at the mall, should of eat at the food court. We were there around 7pm yesterday on a Monday night and there was only couple other tables eating, I had a bad feeling but am thinking it's Monday night. Food was uneventful, soup was not hot and bland, and they use dry rice noodles. I don't know if I am spoiled by some of the vietnamese restaurants in Scarborough and Markham area, the few that I go to use fresh vietnamese rice noodles not the dry noodles, I hate the taste of dry rice noodles. We ordered 4 soup noodles, 2 small 2 medium and they only give us a small plate of bean sprouts and no fresh chilies. Spring rolls was good but the grilled pork was way too sweet, can't taste any other herbs but sweet. We were done around 7:30pm and was sitting there chatting. The server was mopping the floor around us, we sat close to the door and he could of mop anywhere in the restaurant but he chose to mop where we were sitting, I think he was trying to tell us it's time to go. Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"Food: the food has always been consistent for me. I've been coming here for years to enjoy a lunch with a colleague or maybe a Sunday brunch with the family. Food is always tasteful, fast and delicious.   Environment: it's a fast pace, sit down eat and go. The location has minor renovations, some of the chairs can be replaced... But hey I'm here for the food not for the furniture.  Staff: fast pace, lil or no English but it's not a problem, they're very friendly and smiling all the time.   Parking: it's in a plaza, very open a lot of selections  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"When I ordered the fried rice with bbq pork they had the eggs shells in my food, it was not appetizing at all. Very poor service as well."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting worse and worse, while their prices just keep getting higher and higher. I had major Vietnamese food cravings, and came here for the grilled chicken bun to satisfy them.  When we went, there was a line waiting to be seated. There were empty tables inside, but none had been cleaned in time. The waiters appeared to be too \"busy\" to serve us. Even as we were seated, it took them a while to give us our drinks and menus.  Three people in our party ordered pho, and all three portions arrived... without any of the accompanying sides. When we pressed them for the herbs, the vegetables came in a tiny portion, barely enough for the three people.   The size of my portion has increased since the last I came, which is fair considering their prices have also increased. The chicken was marinated well, and slightly charred. It was a little drier than I would have liked, but oh well.   My sister and mom ordered a rice with fried fish and grilled chicken to share. Similar to my chicken, theirs was likewise dry. That being said, they really enjoyed the fish and said it was well executed.  The standard of service has definitely declined, which is sad because it wasn't good before. I'm not sure if it was because we came on Labour Day and they were understaffed, but the young waiters (seemingly high school aged) could barely handle everything.  Likely won't return unless all other pho places are full."}
{"text":"On a business trip and craving for some Vietnamese egg noddles (mi). After a quick drive, 20 min from airport. Mi dac biet was on point. Shrimp spring rolls were fresh and delicious. Also had the cafe sua da, the right way. Came with an individual coffee brewer and condensed milk. Overall, the food was satisfying. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Not too familiar with the area but glad to know that amidst the usual Western chain-y restaurants, there is a Pho place within the Vaughan Mills plaza (near the Montana's on Rutherford).  This place is pretty big and the menu is huge with all the signature Vietnamese dishes. I always order the Fresh Shrimp Rolls where ever I am in Pho place so I got two orders of it. It was good, but as with most places, this restaurant does not take the vein out from the shrimp. So, there were times when I bit in half of the roll and I saw this hair-like thing sticking out from the shrimp...sigh...nothing you can do.  I also ordered a large beef ball pho which hit my pho-fix all right. The large size is actually perfect for someone who is really hungry, or good for two.   Decent Pho place for the area I guess."}
{"text":"It always feels a little odd, to review a chain restaurant. But everyone needs to know this location is better than the rest!  After growing up eating quality home-made pho (mama makes best!), it's always different eating out. Even with the popular, 'Pho Mi 99', even staple dishes can be screwed up. (HOW? It's so simple?!)  Over the years, I've watched quality, even quantity, slip away from some Vietnamese restos. Notably, one of them now serving a third of a beef ball. Not even half. But a third.   However, the heartland location is definitely one of the best in Mississauga.   Food here is almost, always on point. Staff are super friendly and timely.  Atmosphere super casual, as usual - but still super clean and updated.   This city knows where good food is at. If you come by on a weekend, or even peak hours on a weekday, they're full packed! Beware!"}
{"text":"the soup was good but because of the language barrier it was hard to talk to the server."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple of years now, but only about once a year if that. This time around, everything was so perfect it reminded me why I love pho. My rare beef pho was hot, full of flavour, and had more than enough noodles to feed 2 people. The weather outside is cold, so a steaming hot tasy pho is all the better. Usually portion size is a problem because it varies so widely - sometimes there's barely enough noodles for only one person and I end up having to order another bowl, sometimes there's enough for 2.5 - 3 people. The good thing about pho here though is that the broth is consistently fantastic.  Service is quite minimal; you get things only if you ask for them. Some servers don't speak English while others are more on the stern side rather than being welcoming/accomodating, but I don't really mind bad service as it just gets reflected in the tips. In fact, I might even prefer it lol.  Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant. It's spacious, pretty clean, and conveniently located. I haven't been back in a while so management may have changed, but I was so thoroughly impressed this time around (by the food) I'll definitely be back before winter ends."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother because their other location (next to Oceans) was closed. Usually my brother and I share an XL rare beef pho and it's enough to feed both of us, so I ordered that in this location with those expectations in mind.  The pho comes and bowl is huge, but its 60% - 70% broth, broth that was a tad weaker than normal. There's clearly not much noodles, which happens too often at pho places but it's a decent amount so we decide to just eat. We end up having to order another XL pho and surprisingly had to eat it all to be full.  In short, this location is another one of those pho places that skimps on noodles that aren't worth jack but at least they give you more than enough broth to make up for it. Consistency in the amount of noodles they give you is a longstanding problem imo for pho. Sometimes there's barely enough for 1 person, sometimes there's more than enough for 2. This location is decent for this restaurant chain, better than many other pho places, but I'll only come back if the Oceans location is closed."}
{"text":"I love their pho broth and quality of meat used, which made me try the beef pho for the first time as I'm accustomed to ordering seafood instead. This place exceeded my expectations and always has a great vibrant ambience which makes it a very family friendly place and I enjoy hanging out with friends here knowing there's something in the menu for everyone's taste. A friend of mine ordered the Viet iced coffee last weekend which looked delicious, I have to try it next time! The owners are always kind and accommodating and are customer service centric! I'll be returning soon for more #203 and Viet iced coffee"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last couple months, and I'm never disappointed.  Price is amazing for the size of portion size. Compared to other Vietnamese locations, this location has a lot of items on their menu ranging from standard pho to Vermaselli."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 located outside Vaughn Mills Shopping Center is not a bad place for pho in the area.  The noodles isn't too soft and the soup base is quite tasty.  Pricing here is decent as well and the service is fair.  Pho Mi 99 is quite big here and is busy usually.  Spring roll is crispy but not that tasty.  They have good mango shake as well.  Will probably stop by again after making a run at Vaughn Mills.  Rating:  Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  3/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, before visiting this spot in October of last year, I......had.....never.....ha....Pho!!!! GASP!!!!  I know, I know, it's a Yelp Community Manager staple... go for Pho. But I'd honestly never thought to experiment with this style of cuisine and I honestly judged these places on their appearance. Shame on me. Shame Shame Shame on me!  Since dipping into the Pho end of the pool (get it), I've been back numerous times and have come to adore this as my fave cheap comfort food. In fact, I would wary a prediction that I would likely eat this over 2 am drunk Chinese Food, over Poutine, over Pizza (ya I know... this is serious).   I can only equate the feeling of eating Pho @ Pho Mi 99 as the same feeling you get when your mom makes you a grilled cheese and Chicken soup when your home sick from school. You feel full, warm, healthy and totally comfortable - seriously everything is right in the world! Best of all IT'S SO DAMN CHEAP. I have literally asked for the biggest and most expensive bowl of Pho with every kind of meat in the largest size and my total is always less than $10!  I'm down for Pho anyday, anytime, just call me, and I'm in there like swimwear!!  EatCrest Out!!"}
{"text":"This is my local pho place, so the owners recognize me and they're always really nice. It's usually not that crowded, so you can typically pick your own booth. The establishment is clean and well-lit. For some reason the washrooms are megacold tho LOL so chilly :(  As for the food - my favourite dish is the grilled chicken pho. The grilled chicken arrives seperately so you can add it to your own dish. The portion sizes are great for their value. When I go with a friend, we usually just split a large bowl of pho and that comes out to about $9! Food always arrives quite quickly. Pho Mi 99 is also great for takeout as well.  Service is pretty decent - the owners just hang around and nobody checks up on your table so if you need anything, you'll have to go up or flag a waiter down.  There's also free wifi! The code is on the front door as you walk in."}
{"text":"This is the first and last time we ate at this location! We ordered our usual, #222. The soup was not hot enough to cook the noodles and meat. Everything was raw and we were not able to eat anything. The spoons weren't clean AND there was a hair in the plate of sprouts. I am utterly disgusted by this location. Never making the mistake of going there again!"}
{"text":"Alright folks time to review this place, This is one of those places that after I tried the first time , I went back pretty much every other night, very good food, amazing soups, good Pho, awesome Pad thai and out of this world pork spring rolls ( must try the deep fried kind not the clear one  ) please do. you will thank me :)   downside to this place expect no customer service but good for takeouts   Price=Cheap Quality=Good ( greasy but good ) Quantity=Huge Service = okay  Parking= Huge Plaza ( free )"}
{"text":"Much better than I had anticipated. The wonton noodle soup was really tasty and there was plenty of noodles."}
{"text":"I went there twice in the last week, and liked it a lot. Everything is delicious and reasonably priced, and the portions are pretty big too.  I had chicken and pork on my first visit, and whatever they marinated them in tasted amazing.  My second visit I was feeling like something unhealthy, so I had chicken fried rice and spring rolls, which was very filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Average food quality, fast service, average price. Spacious sitting area, not far from Vaughan mills with parking space.  Ordered house special pho and curry chicken egg noodle. Egg noodle is thick ones, soup is a bit watered down.  Overall average pho place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!   Pho Mi 99 is clean, well kept and the staff are nice and friendly.   The FOOD was amazing. Was quick to be made and tastes delicious. Super fresh and full of flavour!   I also asked for a little bit of extra veggies in my pho, and I got so much extra in there! Was very generous amount of extra veggies!!   This place definitely deserves a 5 out of 5 stars.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Decent Pho. I've only had the rare beef and brisket. Very filling. Very busy at lunch hour, so much so that they'll sit 2 couples side by side at a 4 seater. I don't mind as long as the people next to you are polite. Quick service and about $10 for lunch. No complaints here."}
{"text":"great taste? large special beef pho is good for two people. tried chicken roll today, it is great! more tasty than shrimp roll!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today with a co-worker. Nice atmosphere...of course it's world up so the patrons were out in full force to watch the games anywhere. I ordered a Pho chicken and beef. I don't know what I was thinking because I don't normally eat this. Oh well! The broth was very good not so greasy, the size of the Large is definitely a Medium size in Scarborough. So we ended up order spring rolls and a beef rice wrap. I don't really have any complaints other than the size of the Large. Would I go again? Yea I think so."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I am a repeat customer.  I have decided to write a review now as I see that it hasn't been favourable in some eyes.  I can say that everyone that I have introduced this place too has been delighted.  My friends ranging from Korean to white in descent so as to not skew any objectives.  The place is always busy when we arrive and the service is very quick and always with a smile.  I have to say that for the area it is pleasant from where I usually get my Pho fixings.  Not to disrespect this one it's not comparable to where I normally eat.  Like I said it's pretty good for the area.  I always eat the Special bowl pretty much every Pho I go to.  Go ahead and enjoy a nice bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"It's... good. I mean, it's not amazing, but it's clean and the service is friendly so you can't go wrong. I came for lunch with my little one, and we were just ahead of the rush, so we had our pick of seats. They had a high chair for my girl (and they offered a booster that straps to the seat as well), which is awesome since that meant I didn't have to set up my own booster.   They gave me a cup of hot water since I didn't want tea, and they checked up on me part way through the meal (which is unheard of I think, for a pho place). Once the place got busy, it was impossible to get a second cup of water, but they didn't rush us out.   The food is good, but not spectacular. The portions are surprisingly small (a small is, in my opinion, kind of tiny for a pho place). The beef stew was well-flavoured, but more watery and the beef was tough. The spring rolls were deliciously crispy. It's a solid place, and if you're craving some pho in the area it's a good place to go to."}
{"text":"I have been coming pretty regularly to this restaurant for the past couple of years. It's very convenient as is very close to my In Laws. This is the place we go when we come to visit and we are in the mood for Pho.   As other reviewers have stated, the plaza is large with plenty of parking spaces but depending of the time, it could get really busy.   The inside of the restaurant is spacious and could easily accommodate a large party as they have the smaller tables on the outside with the larger tables in the middle. The place is clean enough and the washroom is adequate.  I will call the service minimal. You won't be ignored but they won't go out of their way to be attentive either. They will take your order, bring your food fairly quick and then they will leave you alone until you go up the counter to pay. If you need anything in between, you will need to grab the attention of one of the servers. In all of my times coming to this place, the servers have not been rude to me however, I wouldn't call them friendly either.   Similar to the service, the food is average too. Portions are decent and dishes are good. I ordered the Pho with rare beef, beef brisket and beef tendons and the broth was flavourful. It seems that the food won't disappoint you but it won't impress you either. However, we have ordered the Pad Thai before and have found them oily and salty.   Overall, this place is good if  you are not able to go to your favourite Pho place as it is a good substitute and you know what you are going to get."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a good variety of options (vegetarian, seafood, etc.) for most dietary restrictions or preferences. They offer large portions and have friendly service. Great place in Brampton; high value for the cost.  Restaurant is clean, spacious, and bright. Pretty casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 is definitely one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town! Their grilled meats are exceptional! Pieces of bold flavoured, charcoal smoked meat over a bed of vermicelli noodles mixed with Nuoc Cham sauce... Nothing gets better than that! Their vermicelli soup bowls are filled with steamy flavourful broth, get it topped with rare beef and you have a little piece of heaven in a bowl!!  Definitely the place to be for casual, authentic Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Much larger than the average phô places in Toronto however the quality and service was just average. I was quite disappointed that half the servers didn't speak English and so we had to wait longer for the (broken) English speaker to serve us thus causing us to wait longer than the usual. As for taste it tastes pretty much like all other phô places. I dont have much to say, however since this is one of the few phô places in the area, ill probably come back (if i happen to be in the area and am craving for phô)."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location many times a couple years ago, as it was really the only Pho place I knew about, and it was my friends favourite. I loved going here - the service was quick, food was great and as always, the Pho felt comforting.  Now dating a wonderful Vietnamese girl for over a year, I have been introduced to many different Pho spots. Having tried the other restaurants, my love for this place has decrease. When i say decrease, i don't mean its bad, just not as good as other locations.  I usually order Pho Tai Ga (pretty basic meal, chicken and beef in noodle soup). Maybe 5-8 minutes after ordering, we got our meals. I didn't order any drink, but instead drank the tea they provided (i think it was green tea? I'm not very good with my teas lol) but they offer pop and beer from what i could see.   It was time to dig into my pho! Tasted great, but I found that a bunch of the beef was clustered together. I don't experience this at other locations, so this was a minus point in my eyes. I quickly devoured my large bowl after clearing my hunger. Most places including 99 have MSG in their Pho, so as usual, i was pretty thirsty, so i drank a few cups of tea.  All in all, the food was pretty good, but did not stand out compared to other Pho places. I prefer Golden Turtle over Pho-Mi-99, but wouldn't mind going back here if i am in the area."}
{"text":"Average pho place with an extensive menu; service is fast but not attentive or welcoming towards patrons. The food is seasoned well; you can not modify the orders or ask for sauces on the side."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and i must say I truly enjoyed myself. Their menu is extremely long with a lot of selection to choice from, My favourite item on their menu is their hot and sour chicken soup. It encouraged me to go home and try to make it myself. I will be honest and say their soup is a lot better. Another one of my favourites is their chicken pad thai, they mix the perfect blend of spices to create one of the most delicious pad thai I have ever had.  The only thing I can say their can improve on (do not know if it with increase their cliental since they are a extremely busy restaurant) is their physical appear. The environment is not that welcoming however their food still is."}
{"text":"Twenty years ago I used to go to Pho MI 99 at Dundas and Dixie. It had the best Vietnamese food in the city. When I walked into this Mississauga location its like I stepped back in time. While new and modern, the room was identically designed. The tables, the menu, the chatter of Asian clientelle, and even the owner, looking smart in her glasses, at the front counter.   She hadn't changed a bit. And lucky for us, neither has her food. She walked up to me, after not seeing each other in decades and said: \"Would you like your usual, bbq pork with egg noodle soup and spring roll?\" I was in shock. We often hear about famous businessmen of major corporations doing bold things. What we don't hear enough about are women like this, who have, over decades, quietly started and built a string of successful businesses by, day-in and day-out, delivering quality and really caring for her customers.  When the food came, it was the same umptuous offering it always was. Unbeleivable broth, perfect bbq pork, sweet ground pork and a sprinkling of garlic and onions. Seriously. I've eaten everywhere, and this place is, hands down, the best Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA, probably Canada, and possibly one of the best outside of Vietnam. I can't even articulate how good the fried pork spring rolls are... ridiculous.  Do yourself a favour. Eat here."}
{"text":"I usually come here after a long day of work with my sisters mainly for their hot pot.    I love the Thai style broth, it's sweet, sour and a little bit of spice.  Cook all your seafood and beef in the broth...so yummy!  Exactly what we needed on this extreme cold day.  We get one order of the fixings and share it between 4 ppl.  In the platter you get green vegetables (I believe it's watercress), shrimp, fish, squid, mussels, clam, oysters, beef and rice noodles.  You can always order more on top as well, but I found the $5 worth of extra beef we ordered was a rip-off...not much for $5.  All and all...still our go-to for hot pot.  I haven't had the chance to try the pho here, but I find most places are pretty much alike.  Good food for a decent price.  The staff here are nice as well, they have a lot of people working, so there's always someone around if you need something."}
{"text":"Ahh the pho broth is so good! It's got flavour but isnt salty. The rare beef is also fairly lean so if you're picky with that like I am, it'll be easy to eat cause there isnt much fat on the beef. The restaurant is spacious and pretty new, and the service is good. OHH and try the spring rolls. I'll be craving them till the next time I go back......"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this Pho place. The service was fast and efficient and the food was good! I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli with a spring roll.  The lemon grass grilled pork was tender, juicy and flavourful. There was a good amount of meat with the vermicelli, basil, lettuce and bean sprouts.  The spring roll was delicious! I love it when the outside of the spring roll is super crunchy and the insides had a good mixture of pork, taro, vermicelli and vegetables.  I had a taste of the pho as well and I like how the soup isn't too greasy. My only little complaint was that they don't give you a lot of beef with the soup."}
{"text":"Came with some family. Broth was not good, the tripe wasn't cleaned properly (still had an odour to it) service was good and friendly. Overall would not eat here again.. there are plenty of pho restaurants to choose from, this is not it."}
{"text":"I've gone here for years now so, I love that they know who we (my family) are when we walk in. Friendly service, not as outdated as most Pho stores in Mississauga, and wallet friendly. Decent Pho, fast service, fried rice and fried fish has got to be my fave dish."}
{"text":"I was here recently with my husband and my parents.  Pho Mi 99 is in the strip mall across from Vaughan Mills Mall.  So if you don't want to eat in the food court, just go across the parking lot to Pho Mi 99 - you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant is big and clean.  The washrooms are also clean.  This place has mostly Vietnamese food, but also has Chinese and Thai dishes.   We ordered the Mixed Pad Thai (Shrimp, Chicken, Beef and Tofu), Deluxe Cantonese Chow Mein (Shrimp, Chicken, Beef, Squid and Fish Balls), and Stir-fried Shrimp with Vegetables.   The Pad Thai was the best of the lot.  The Pad Thai tastes very different from Pad Thai at other restaurants, but it was good nonetheless.  There is a lot of galangal in the Pad Thai, you can taste the grittiness (but it's not a bad thing).  There is also more fish sauce than at other places.  I personally really enjoyed it.  There was plenty of meat and tofu and it was all very flavourful and delicious.  The only negative thing was that it was a little bit oily, but this is the case with Pad Thai at all restaurants.      The Cantonese Chow Mein was also delicious.  The noodles were very crispy and it was topped with lots of meat, seafood and vegetables (broccoli, carrot, and peppers).  The sauce of this dish was very similar to the sauce of the stir-fried shrimp dish (it might even have been the same sauce).  The shrimp dish was equally delicious, with lots of shrimp (although a smaller size) and veggies (broccoli, carrot, peppers and baby corn).    Service was fast, and you get free tea as soon as you sit down.  Definitely better than the stuff you'd get at the Vaughan Mills Mall food court.  I'd go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A decent place for a quick dinner.  Service was quick and food was tasty. I particularly enjoyed the spring rolls.  When I left, they accidentally tacked on a takeout order to my bill (I KNOW I didn't order anything extra... I filled out the order sheet myself!) and they seemed really annoyed. Kind of a strange glitch to my meal.  It was pretty good, I'd probably come back if I were in the area and wanted a quick, tasty meal."}
{"text":"The guys here are amazing servers.  I always order #106, at any pho mi 99. - fishballs and seafood.  It is clean in here. go here. Pho spot for cold days, headaches, sore throats and chilling out with your friends."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! The jumbo beef soup #200 is our usual order with 3 colour beans shaved ice drink. The size of the jumbo bowl is just perfect for me and my 3 year old to share! They are very generous with the bean sprout. The owner also help around in the store and very friendly. Best place to go in a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"I like Pho and I really enjoy Vietnamese food.  So here we are on a Tuesday night at Pho Mi.  It's situated in a great plaza with a choice of middle eastern, sushi, or Vietnamese.  How could you go wrong?  Ordered #211, and shrimp and veggies on rice noodles as well as  fresh shrimp rolls.  Shrimp rolls were made fresh to order and exactly what I expected.  Pho here is always good.  Broth looks and tastes  like it took hours to make as you can see the delicious mini pools of beef fat. Seafood noodles were a generous mound of veggies and small shrimp on noodles.  Could have used more noodles but other than that it was good.  Service is friendly.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Pho #201 and the deep fried spring rolls.  Friendly and frightfully efficient In a good way.  They drop off tea while you peruse the menu.  Magically appear when you write down your order and in what seemed like minutes brought over our pho and the spring rolls shortly after!    Good broth, generous portion of noodles and meats and a nice fresh mound of bean sprouts, basil, and greens to go on your pho.  Spring roll was crispy but also a bit greasy  which is typical.  I wish I had one of these closer to me as I would come several days a week!  Hit the spot... Definitely...."}
{"text":"If you're having a pho crave after shopping at Vaughn mills, then you're only moments away.  Solid bowl of pho, and had my bowl to me in about 5 minutes.  Clean, good service, it's pho'd up."}
{"text":"I eat pho often and Pho Mi 99 is one of the best. They have a larger range of dishes and their seasoning feels very authentic. For example, certain dishes will come with a giner sauce. Some Pho places don't give you this.   I love their fried fish dishes. A lot of pho places don't have fried fish so this is a good choice if you want something new. Pho Mi 99 Special beef noodle is always good. I've tried their rice and vermicilli dishes a million times. Always good. Their milkshakes are GOD LIKE!  Like most other viet restaurants, their service is FAST. They aren't going to ask you how you're doing and that's fine with me. I care mostly about the food.   I'm super price conscious and Pho Mi 99 makes me really happy. The only restaurants in Toronto that can compete with Pho Mi 99 in terms of value is McDonalds and Burger King. Yes that's how cheap the food is. A large beef noodle soup is just $7.25 + tax and there's a good chance you can't even finish it.   It's losing one star because I ordered something I've never had before and it had pork blood curds. I wish they disclosed this in the menu description."}
{"text":"I had been going here for years, but for the past year I found another better place so I stopped going.  Today I returned because I was in the same mall for some other shopping so we (my husband and I) decided to return here.  I usually ordered a medium beef noodles with extra beef slices on the side.  I put all my raw beefs in the soup when it arrived (I just don't like fully cooked beef), and after I put in all the other stuff (bean sprouts and spices) and started to dig in.  After a few spoons of noodles I stirred up the beef and there were a big knot of hair in there!  I was horrified and called the waitress to look at my bowl.  She looked as surprise as I was.  Usually if I find one hair in my food, I don't make much of a fuzz about it, but this is like 20+ long hairs all knotted up together.  It was inside the raw beef that I received on the side.  They replaced the food (soup bowl and side beef) but I mostly lost my appetite and didn't finish the food.  We paid full price for the meal (most places would replace the meal and either give us a discount or some other free stuff like dessert or drinks, and we also ordered 2 drinks that are not alcoholic) and I was not impressed.  They didn't even say sorry just said we would replace it. So after this experience, we will not be returning to this place ever again.  There are many other good pho places that opened lately that are better tasting.  I feel sick even thinking about it now."}
{"text":"I left the place feeling more annoyed and sick then when I entered. 99 is usually the one safe choice for me to go to when I'm feeling viet food (which is rare). I usually order the rice and rice noodle because their grilled meat was something to rave about. Over the years, it was notable that quality and prices are both moving in an inverse pattern to each other, Prices are unjustifiably increasing and yet quality are dropping to an unacceptable standard. That being said, this pattern are seen across the viet cuisine landscape but some are more drastic then others. The branch of 99 was yet another soar disappointment and was a shell of a restaurant that it use to be in its glory days. I really am saddened and annoyed. Service wasn't all that bad but the food left me regretting my choice. The meats (grilled chicken and pork chop) was dried to an inedible state, the steamed egg meatloaf was seems to be frozen and reconstituted (leaving that nasty spongy and soggy taste). I also ordered the deep fried shrimp cake with was ridiculously dried to the point of the shrimp losing all its taste and texture-leaving it leather-like and dry, once again, also tasting not very fresh. The soup for the pho was sweet but not from cooking the bones. It left a really strange sweet, sugary after taste that comes from msg and sugar. Overall the only edible thing in that meal was the nem nuong. I do not make it a habit to waste food, either trying to finish it or pack it home, I did not even hesitated to leave 80% of the meat untouched. I cried a little when I paid...will not be coming back, sad to say."}
{"text":"This is my go to PHO place whenever I'm in the Vaughan area. It's located conveniently across from Vaughan Mills Shopping Mall so you can come here   for a quick bite before or after shopping.  There is a wide selection of food items on the menu but I usually come here for their tasty pho noodles, it's perfect on a cold day or if you're ever hungover. I usually get a small bowl of noodles with beef, beef tripe and beef balls. The beef is thinly sliced and they always offer a generous portion. The soup broth however stands out from the rest, it's hot, tasty, light and not oily compared to some other PHO restaurants. My boyfriend and I also ordered their shrimp rolls which are made fresh daily and is a perfect appetizer to the meal.  You can easily get a bowl of noodles and be completely satisfied for just under $8! Totally comfort food at a cheap cost.  Service is pretty standard for an asian place, it's quick and efficient!  So come here if you're ever craving that perfect bowl of pho noodle soup."}
{"text":"Almost a year after I started coming here, still very pleased. I've come so often I don't look at the menu and write down 201 - medium - special rare beef with tripe, tendon and flank.   I could litteraly come in, order eat and pay within 20 mins. I've done it once! Quick and fast service, lots of seating. I've only encountered one line up while waiting Friday afternoon at 12:30pm."}
{"text":"Decent food for reasonable price  I always go for pho and veggie stir fry, egg rolls  Service is fast but could be friendlier to customers  Overall,  not bad for Mississauga"}
{"text":"best pho in town, been here too many times, the pho has never let me down. Very hearty and refreshing. Although in my opinion the rest of the menu is mediocre, probably just outshined by their amazing pho.  the thai styled wings are amazing too"}
{"text":"Came here at lunch time! Got the last table before the insane lunch rush! If you don't get here before 12:10, you will wait a while! Good pho is hard to find! I had 234 which is a beef pho. I got a large and it was enough to feed a family of 4. Very generous portion filled with lots of extras! This version had pineapple which added a nice sweetness. They have all their utensils and sauces already on the table. Complimentary tea is also served. Great restaurant good service excellent quality! There are many items on their menu but I stuck to what I thought hey would do best: pho! Would definitely visit again and get something else!"}
{"text":"It is what you probably have come to expect from a Pho place.  Familiar menu and pricing... plus some dishes I hadn't seen at many other Pho places.  Everything was good but the food was not particularly memorable.  Decor,  Service and cleanliness were very good."}
{"text":"Since my first review I have since experienced much more Pho soup, and have gone to various different places all around the GTA, I must say this place is my favourite. I go back all the time and I have yet to find better spring rolls than these! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I rate this place 4 stars for food, but 2 stars for service. The pho was excellent. The service, not so much. We were given menus and asked (twice) while we were still standing in line for our order so they could get everything through faster. I understand efficiency but this was a little too pushy for my liking.  Another small issue we had was our teapot being taken away for a refill but never returned because they were so understaffed and forgot. Would come back only because of the food, definitely not for the service."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. This place never disappoints.   Get the Pork w/Vermicelli.   Also, try their papaya smoothie."}
{"text":"My new favorite for Vietnamese when overnighting in Toronto. Clean, prompt excellent service and fresh plentiful tasty food.  Tea showed up instantly and I was asked if I preferred cold to the hot he brought. Got my usual beef vermicelli (got wild and crazy and got the satay beef) and what I thought was a basic pork salad roll. Asked to confirm and (as usual when I come here) the waiter told me 'no no' and explained I was ordering something with pork skin. Phew saved once again by the keen gentleman.  The order showed up very very fast and as usual a wide variety of sauces are set out on every table. I frequently complain about the lack of fresh veggies in other vermicellis, but here at Pho Mi 99, there are a ton of veg, very fresh. 7$ for the vermicelli and $4 for 2 large salad rolls.   I often drive from the 401, all the way up the 400 just to come here... if that's any indication how excellent it is."}
{"text":"This is your typical Pho Mi 99.  Fast, efficient, cheap and average tasting.  I've had their \"special\" and the beef brisket stew.  Their special uses decent meats, however I wasn't too impressed by their beef brisket stew.  While the broth was very tasty, I found the brisket a bit tough.  Also, while I don't think this location is dirty, for some reasons, the tables felt slightly sticky.  Maybe because it's older.   I'd recommend going to the Pho Mi 99 on Grand Park instead if you don't mind driving a bit."}
{"text":"Ughh..I hate to lower my review but the last few times have been weird.  While they've renovated, I feel like they have no respect for basic restaurant etiquette.    1st time: While a server was giving me a tea cup, they coughed into the tea cup (there was still some distance, but it was weird).  Didn't even turn his head.    2nd time: I saw the owner carrying out my pho bowl but right above it was someone bill's on a tray. Not the biggest deal, but what if there was dust on the bottom of the tray? It could have went into my soup.    Verdict: Probably not visiting this 99 anymore.  I feel like they spent too much time and focus on renovations and not basic restaurant etiquette"}
{"text":"See previous review.  I updated my review for the wrong location."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch. Crazy busy but there's a reason for it. The food is delicious! Big portions. Very reasonable prices. One of the best places in the area for yummy Vietnamese fare."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this location because a friend of mine who use to work nearby went here all the time.  I wanted to get a dish modified (add shrimp to a beef dish ) and the server said that isn't possible.  I would have paid extra as I just wanted more meat.  Got the dish and it was okay in terms of flavour and quality.   On par with decent pho but nothing fantastic.   Service was pretty standard as well, as the waiter was not super fluent and did get my order wrong as well.  When I brought that up he was arguing about how I ordered.  I probably will not visit again."}
{"text":"I'm always on a never ending quest to find Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto that make great pho and after doing some shopping at Vaughan Mills Outlet Mall, I ended up at Pho Mi 99.  In Toronto, there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants now. A lot of them serve very mediocre pho and very few serve good pho and only a handful do an amazing bowl of pho. Pho Mi 99 falls just slightly below the good rating but definitely better than the mediocre end.  I ordered a medium Pho Dac Biet (House special for $8.00 plus tax), the noodles were cooked right, beef quality was only okay, a little too fatty for my liking and the broth was not bad but a little on the weak side in terms of a rich flavour. It's still a decent bowl of pho but nowhere near the top places in the city.  If you're near the Vaughan Mills area, it's a decent choice and probably slightly higher priced for the west end but still very reasonable and pretty clean from my experience eating there. It's also 100% Vietnamese run and owned if that matters to you."}
{"text":"Your typical Pho Mi 99.  One of my friends who does not like Pho at all, likes to come here and order the sweet and sour deep fried tilapia, which is $12.99-$14.99 I think.  It's the entire fish, but I find that kind of pricey for tilapia that you can get at a grocery store for 2.99-$3.99 per lb or around $4-$5 per fish with some weird sweet and sour sauce.   The service here is okay (for a Pho place), but it can get noisy, however the good points to this place are:  a) Close to Vaughan Mills b)  They offer cold tea during summer months.  Not a bad choice if you are in Vaughan Mills and probably one of the better choices for a quick meal (better than Vaughan Mills food court)"}
{"text":"The pho here can be hit or miss. The absolute worst was when I was served lukewarm pho and the noodles have soaked up most of the broth. I suspect I was given someone else's reject order or that my order was made and forgotten for 10-15mins.  The only reason I still come here is because the spring rolls here are made with rice paper (like how it's made in Vietnam). Most Vietnamese restaurants use the standard wheat spring roll paper instead."}
{"text":"After a horrible pho experience at Pho Dau Bo on Bristol Road, Mississauga, I tried this place out .  The service was great! There were a couple of waiters/ waitress and I was approached immediately by one waiter to take my order.  I requested extra basil and boy, did they oblige! Definitely got a lot and they were green and fresh, unlike the one at Pho Dau Bo, where half of the leaves were brown.  There was sufficient amount of meat in the soup, but I did find the chicken to be dry.  A little pricier than the regular pho place, but overall, it was good."}
{"text":"Came here last week with my girl. Wish I took photos :( we ordered amazing food and pho.   My girl ordered rice with pork and sunny egg on top. The pork taste sweet and delicious. She also ordered fried rice with chicken beef and shrimp.   I ordered well done beef pho and chicken fried rice.   All portions are big and made to share. Pho soups come in different sizes. A medium is enough for me :) You also recieve complimentary tea to drink.   This place is very clean, has a lot of tables and can accommodate large parties. This place also has very fast service and friendly happy staff"}
{"text":"This is the place where I take my co-workers to test their 'Chop' Stick-handling skills.  I have been to this Vietnamese restaurant since they opened near Vaughan Mills and I am so glad because they offer great value for a good product.  I would even go in on my own sometimes for lunch, and it is the lunch rush they usually have as I have been there for dinner once and they only had a couple tables filled.  I typically order a medium-size PHO and they would offer hot tea or cold tea depending on request or season.  When I submit my order on the order-form, they would be back with a dish of the typical Bean Sprout/Lime/Herb.  Another few minutes pass and they would bring my Pho out steaming hot and I have never had any complains as they have been consistent through-out the years.  I've been there since they had the old menu, but now they have a pretty & laminated menu.  The best part is I can GULP the Pho down, go up to pay my $7.00 and leave in under 20 min and be in time to go back to work while other restaurants take anywhere from 45 to 90 min to complete.  FYI, it is known that a few of my co-workers/friends cannot finish a medium Pho while I have NEVER ever left my Pho behind.  I would go back to work feeling signs of ITIS and on days when someone gets a large I can not will not back down!  Me Man!"}
{"text":"The fastest service I ever experienced in similar restaurants.  Unfortunately, that was the only main positive. The food didn't taste very good. I don't want to excuse it by a visit on a weekday, but the meat tasted old, definitely not fresh.   The positives would be that they have enormous selections of meals. Also prices are very affordable.. but we really missed  the freshness  in our meals :("}
{"text":"Pho was good,  Service was almost non-existing.   Flagging down the server is a must if you want something"}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 has been around for ages! Pho Mi 99 is located in the mini plazas of Vaughan Mills Shopping Center - you'll see it when you are driving out of the mall (but before you actually exit the mall +parking perimeter).   We decided to go with one of their phos. Prices for these depend on the size. Small - $6.50, Medium - $7.50, Large - $8.50 and Extra-Large - $9.50. The soup base for the pho wasn't steaming hot - but that's what I look for in the soup base, because a steaming hot bowl means that they have boiled it completely, as opposed to a medium to high heat. The noodles were alright, nothing extremely special.  Their pork with rice was a standard average Vietnamese dish. It came with the same sauce as the spring rolls. Definitely one of my go to dishes!  For a snack, we ordered the Deep Fried Spring Rolls (under snacks) for $4.50. These spring rolls were longer than other places, cut into three pieces each and crispy. Dip it with the sauce - I think it's the best part."}
{"text":"We all decided to give in to our craving for pho.  One person did a quick internet search that brought us to Pho Mi 99.  We arrived as the lunch rush was in full swing and were very happy to be seated immediately.  Note that diners are expected to write down their own orders on the order form provided.  Each of us ordered the pho combo with everything (#1?).  Two fo us ordered \"medium\" portions and two ordered \"large\" portions.  A tiny plate of sprouts, basil, lime and chilis arrived at our table.  Given that all four of us ordered pho we weren't sure if this was meant for all of us to share or if three more plates would be arriving.  Yup, it was meant for us to share.   After a 15 minute wait our food arrived and the bowls were HUGE.  What they consider a medium serving would be a large or extra large where I'm from.  Whoa!  The large portion could have easily fed 3 people!  And no, none of us were able to finish our dishes.  The noodles were slightly chewy and perfectly cooked, the broth was hot, rich and flavorful and the meat was abundant (more than I've ever received for a \"medium\" portion).  Conversation was kept at a minimum as we happily slurped our noodles.  This place is clean, crowded and filled with people that seemed really happy to be there.  Portions are HUGE, the food is good and prices are very reasonable.   What more could you ask for?  Patrons seemed to range from office workers to housewives to construction workers.   A good place for lunch.  There is no way a person can leave here hungry."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to place for phó.. their quality of food has gone down since I went here in 2010.. One thing that I'm sad that this location doesn't have that many other locations do is Bubble tea, they have fruit shakes but they don't carry bubble tea which I think would help alot in their business cause usually people enjoy bubble tea with their phó or after phó.  I ordered:  Phò with rare beef and beef balls- I did ask for them not to put any onion and green onion since it was for my son. They have three sizes but unfortunately for take out you can only choose a Medium or a Large. So I could only choose medium which is a bit too much for my son to eat since he is only 4 years old.. the flavor isn't as it use to be we had to add alot of soya sauce and hoisin to get a nice flavor.  Fresh rolls with pork and shrimp- ingredients were fresh and roll was rolled right where nothing fell out.. their dipping sauce was very salty so I suggest using a little bit at a time.  Grilled pork spring rolls and mince shrimp on a sugar cane vermicelli- too much lettuce and bean sprout dish was very oily.. the grilled pork had a good flavor I would just suggest for them to make sure their food isn't greasy.  They have quick service and friendly staff and of you make special request they are more than happy to get it done so overall cause of their service it's a good place to go to but again they don't have bubble tea"}
{"text":"Ver good service and food here. The owners and staffs are very friendly. We were offered extra vegtables for our order by the female owner without extra cost. The restaurant is clean and nice. I highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"I made a stop at this spot on a recommendation of a friend and it was perfect pho weather.  It was warm but there was also a slight impending chill in the air.  I remember walking into the restaurant that had high ceilings and tables were filled with people happily slurping away.  My appetite was whet with anticipation.  I don't think I can ever get away from order the pho house special (or whatever is the closest).  In my many years of sitting down at pho restaurants, I haven't deviated from this choice and it's hard to change now!  So I ordered the house special pho, yas!  The first sip of the beef broth was very soothing.  The taste was very light, delicate, and just right.  There was a little bit of everything (beef slices, tendon, beef balls, tripe, etc) along with the noodles swimming around.   The bowl of pho was really satisfying and I had a great time slurping up all the contents.  They offer the standard accompaniments with the pho such as bean sprouts, lime, and mint leaves but no chili pepper.  You can ask to have the bean sprouts quickly dunked in hot water if you are so inclined.  Would come back to this place when i am in search of a good meal in the area again."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night just to try a different location.  Boyfriend raved how good this location is.  Tried the chicken pad thai and that was delicious. The pho was also very good.  I always order fried spring rolls when I go to pho places. It tasted very good but it was sooooooo oily that I had to blot the spring rolls in tissue first .  Service was fast and efficient. Turnover in this place is fast."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good ! I have had way better Vietnamese food. Wouldn't go there again ever ! The pho was really not the best and the rest of the food was extremely oily!"}
{"text":"Came here recently and was sadly disappointed with the food. We came here on a Saturday at 11:30am and the broth was leftover broth. :( not clear, and the consistency had a powdery, cloudy look to it. Also, a large piece of ginger was in my soup, indicative that it was the bottom of the pot. :( How is it that at the beginning of the day, the soup is already at this state? I can't and don't even want to imagine what it'll be like near dinner time.  The meat quality was not good, fatty pieces of brisket and flavorless sliced ribeye that was undercooked. Add that the cloudy broth was not even hot, but lukewarm, and I was thoroughly turned off from my food. Since, I don't like to waste food, I still ate it.  Shrimp roll was at least fresh with basil and mint leaves and bean sprouts, but the sauce was a hoisin base, when it should have been more peanut based. When does a Vietnamese restaurant not serve peanuts in their dipping sauces? Especially the rice based rolls? Unacceptable.  Anyway, we were not happy with this visit, and likely might not return, but I'll give it another shot, just not anytime soon. Maybe just had an off day.  Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to have Vietnamese beef noodle soup because it was a tradition growing up with my family. Now we come less often because we have moved to Mississauga west and there are closer ones.   They have always been friendly and courteous and have never said no to a request. One of the only places that will switch the rice to veggies for me and not charge me.   Everything tastes fresh and I love their avocado shakes (ask for low sugar). Try their vinegared hot peppers on the table, they pack a great kick!  Lunch is busy so just walk in make eyes with the server and grab ask seat!"}
{"text":"This is where we come on rainy days to enjoy a bowl of chicken pho.  Sometimes the broth can be overly salty and other times it is just right. I tend to order half the noodles as it can be much.  My husband tried the Cantonese chow mein and it was  just ok. We went back to pho."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 is a great Vietnamese restaurant is Mississauga. I can see why it is proclaimed as one of the best in the city.   Their fried spring rolls are a must order and are probably the best ones around. They are crispy yet not overly oily, and super fresh as you can tell from the color of the spring roll wrap. They are a vibrant yellow colour. The inside of the spring roll was absolutely packed with ingredients and there's no 'filler', there's pork, vermicelli, taro, carrots, and more. These are hefty springrolls in terms of size.   What surprised me was the plate of raw veggies here. Not only do they give a lot but they were fresh. There was plenty of crisp bean sprouts, basil, and even lemongrass.   We went for their house special pho here and the broth was excellent. Good pho starts from a good broth and they do it great here. Toppings were reasonable plentiful in terms of sliced beef, tripe, tendons, and beef balls.     There were plenty of seats and tables although all the tables were set up in fours which is kind of inefficient. However, service is lightning quick and the turnaround is fast ensuring a shorter wait despite the looks of a long lineup."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pho restaurant in sauga. Food tastes great, portions are generous, price is right, service is quick and friendly. Just don't come at lunch time on weekdays!"}
{"text":"Update.  I am loving the food here.  We have been back several times and can say that the food is consistently delicious.  I am still having some issues with ordering and the addition of extras but I am loving this place."}
{"text":"This place is definitely just okay. I came here to meet my bro for lunch. The place is clean and they have quick service. This is may be due to the offices near it so that when it's lunch time, all the office workers are here. They have quick service so that's an added plus.  My bro and I shared deep fried spring rolls, fresh shrimp rolls, and I ordered a satay beef vermicelli. The spring rolls were good, the shrimp rolls were also good except for the sauce. It wasn't that peanut-ey. My entree was not as flavourful. I had imagined it would have fish sauce too but it didn't, which was okay if there was lots of satay sauce but it wasn't enough for the dish to cover. All in all this place is okay."}
{"text":"Food is either too salty or bland. I've been here a few times and got the hotpot (bland broth), banh hoi (fish sauce too salty, Chao tom tastes powdery, and spring roll is all carrot filler and wrapping), bi goi is also just filler with a tiny bit of bi. I should have known, it's always dead here.. Even during rush times like right now during lunch on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Been a customer since 2011.  Never disappoints, place looks a lot better after renovations. Prices are still decent. In the end it's just stupid simple pho.   Customer service is excellent, meals come really fast. Call get packed real quick around lunchtime specifically Saturdays.   Will return. Try the veggie rolls here. They do them really well."}
{"text":"I came by here because I wanted some pho and was in the area. This place is not bad. The broth was decent, service was fast but one thing I keep coming back for is the deep fried pork spring rolls! OHHHMYGOOODNESS! My absolute favourite thing in the world. They are bigger than your average spring rolls, it's crunchy, meaty, fresh off the stove and I love it. I would say the only thing is the actual pho broth is a little bland.  I would 100% recommend, and do come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Pho restaurant in Mississauga.  It's very clean and the service is great!  It's always busy, especially during dinner time.  Don't be surprised if you have to line up to get a table.  But the service is quite fast.  We never have to wait long to get our food.  The prices are extremely good, and the portions are good as well. I love to order their thai tom yum soup with fish balls.  This dish normally doesn't come with noodles, so I add rice noodles for an additional cost.  I don't know why, but I love this dish so much!  My fiance always orders the Pho Dac Biet, in a medium size because I can never finish my portion.  Their vermicelli is also great!  It's super fresh tasting, and is especially good in the summer if you don't want a hot steamy soup dish.  I have gone to other locations of Pho-Mi 99, and I didn't like them.  This location is the best one I've been to."}
{"text":"Been here twice already.  Once was a quick lunch during work with a friend when I was working in Mississauga, the other time was en-route to Hamilton to check out Dundas Peak and Webster's Fall.  Both times I really enjoyed my experience here.  This place is large, so you don't feel too tight with other tables and relatively easy to find tables during lunch hours. Staff are super quick and friendly but best of all, the food here are pretty awesome.  I ordered the Pho both time and their Pho have great soup base!  Beef slices are also very tender.  Good beef, good soup base with relatively chewy pho noodle makes a killing combo for any pho noodle soup!  I recommend coming to this place if you are in the area either for lunch or dinner!  You will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"decided to stop by when i was done for work this week - 5 star ratings across the board.....hmmm....had to check that out.  well, service was quick, and our food arrived very quick - we ordered pad thai, and a yellow curry chicken....meh - it was ok but not as favorful as i would have liked.  a typically big box mall style restaurant."}
{"text":"My go-to place for pho and viet food in Mississauga! A fast-paced, efficient place where it only takes 5min from sitting down to having food in front of you (only noodles though, stir-fried stuff will take a bit longer). This place is always packed if you go at peak time, so be aware. They DO accept credit card (unlike other busy Asian restaurants).  The portion here is huge! I could tell complimentary toppings (fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and lime wedges) were very fresh. The broth was flavorful, noodles were cooked perfectly, and meats were tender.   Overall, I recommend this place if you want a quick bite. Cheap and good food, quick service. Very casual setting."}
{"text":"Really shocked and grossed out by my latest experience here. This use to be my usual spot for pho when I go out with friends or family cause of the location. However, I went there a month ago...mid-July with my mom and a cousin. Shocked at how they are declining in service and food.   My cousin and my mom both ordered pho but I went with a simple rice dish that included beef, egg, and slices of tomatoes and cucumber. A fish sauce bowl is provided so you can poured it over the beef. Anyways, a few bites into my meal, I was about to eat a tomato slice but luckily noticed that something was wrong. It was spoiled with chunks of fungus on it! I took it off my dish after taking some pics as proof and left it on a napkin at the edge of the table. My mom told the staff and apparently all they did was say, oh we will check the back to make sure nothing else is spoiled. One of the staff came to my table and just took my spoiled tomato away with out a word of apology. If anything she was muttering something in Viet. Which I can understand but she was saying it too softly. No apologies, bad attitude by server, order not taken off bill or even a discount.   I totally lost my appetite. Like if they left tomatoes out so long that it grew fungus on it, what else isn't fresh? Yikes! To top it off, my mom and I ordered Cafe Sua Da (iced coffee and condensed milk) but got sick from it. Like how can you mess up ice coffee with condensed milk? Not likely I'll ever go back. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"It's quick and decent. It's relatively cheap too. Service is average but no biggie for me at a pho joint!"}
{"text":"Seeing Asian people dining in an Asian restaurant is one thing.   Seeing a crowd of Asian people lining up for a table, is quite another.   Both scenarios mean that the restaurant you've chosen was a great decision!   I arrived early to my lunch with 5 co-workers, which was a good call on my part, because about 15 minutes later, the place was packed and a line-up had started.  It was my first time at Pho Mi 99, the Latimer Road location, right by the Heartland Town Centre in Missisissauga.  (It was also \"Black Friday\" which was probably a contributor to the crowd...Heartland Town Centre is an outlet mall).  I had heard mixed reviews about this place, but all of the negative ones were unbelievable to me once I scanned the crowd: people of all shapes, sizes and colours. There were tourist, shoppers and mid-day business park employees (like me). But most notable, were the Asian people.  That to me, was a sign of great place of Asian food.  I was a fan already and my food hadn't even arrived yet.   I know it's a Vietnamese place, but the menu's photo of Pad Thai looked so very delicious to me at that moment. I ordered a plate of Pad Thai with chicken, no peanuts. My co-workers, (most of whom are regulars), ordered their usual: \"The 404.\" (That is, Number 44 on the menu: Pho with a pork springroll and veggies) There was also a plate of fresh springrolls to share.  My Pad Thai had just the right amount of heat and it was generous size. I'm definitely going back.   This place did NOT disappoint. It's clean and the service was friendly and fast. My food was delicious and my friends were too busy eating to speak.  We were out of there in 45 minutes, a perfect time to get back to work for your 1pm meeting, or get back to the mega-shopping spree. The prices were very reasonable for the portions you get and the calibre of the food? Outstanding. No wonder my co-workers were regulars. Every Friday.   They've let me join their Lunch Club."}
{"text":"Great pho restaurant in the center of Heartland shopping center! The plaza has tons of other restaurants but this seemed to be seriously busy.   We got seated right away, and service was great. Good came quick, server was helpful, and our dishes were served as requested.   Food was great and for the price, portions are huge! Can definitely order and share as a group.   Great choice for lunch/dinner if you like pho!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to this place and the pho is still very good. I shared a large pho with my 9 year old and both of us are so stuffed!!!  The measure of a good bowl of pho is all in the soup.  The flavour or their soup is superb.   The place is a little run down but there's a sign that they are doing renovation in July 2014 so I'm sure it will be much better."}
{"text":"We had to grab a quick bite before heading to get some photos done around the area. We were on a schedule and somewhat of a time crunch. It was lunch time and the plaza of Pho Mi 99 was super busy. The restaurant itself was busy but still had empty tables. We were a table of 10 but got served pretty quickly as expected at a Vietnamese restaurant. Service level is similar to the Pho places that I am use to in Mississauga- quick and easy! Most of us ordered Pho and seemed like everyone enjoyed their food since we ate it all and there were no complaints. I ordered a broken rice dish...Grilled chicken with steamed egg and fried egg. The portion was a good size and the dish came out looking great. I actually just really wanted to steamed egg and it was alright. It was a abit too salty for me and probably a bit too much MSG. The texture was good so I did finish it. The grilled chicken was cooked perfectly but one thing I noticed is the rice was a bit too normal compared to the broken rice dishes I have had before. However, overall, lunch was alright and we were all happy.  I have to say we have some decent Pho restaurants and 99 is similar to the one in sauga. It does not beat some of the other restaurants I have been to but it gets the job done and you will be well fed. Pho Mi 99 is also in a convenient spot and you can do some shopping after a full meal!"}
{"text":"This is one of the cleanest pho mi 99 I've ever been too!   Great food as always! And great service. Fast and accommodating!   Pho is always a good choice and this location is amazing!"}
{"text":"Awful! Awful experience. I've had Pho plenty of times and here, they think that you don't know the difference between full slices of rare beef and the fatty tissue and tendon, usually discarded. This was not a pleasant experience. They try their best to pull one over on you. Not ok. I'd check out other places in the area, I've had many good experiences at other local Pho."}
{"text":"This one is a solid Pho place. Good portions, tasty food. Cleaning-less could use some improvement, but overall definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  The service was excellent as well.  They were one step ahead but at times it almost felt like they were rushing you to leave because the minute you're done eating they want to take your plate/bowl away.  The food was pretty tasty.  I had pho and the Me had chicken and rice and we also had the spring rolls.  The spring rolls could have been a lot hotter but it was ok. Everything smelled and looked good.  They were really quick to bring out the food and we would definitely come again."}
{"text":"We went to this location last night and absolutely horrible.  Fried pork roll, pho and grilled chicken and pork on rice. Worst pho I have ever had. Tasted very watery. I usually put enough hot sauce that the soup turns somewhat red but this did not change color at all. Usually the soup is somewhat clear but it was very swampy looking. Chicken was very rough. Pork roll was alright but still lacked the flavour compared to other places.  There were 2 servers. While the taller one with glasses was nice the other shorter guy was not. Brought our food, asked for 2 forks, came back and we asked for 2 waters and gave a very irritated dirty look. This is also after asking for the pop we ordered but did not receive. Still did not get it and had to ask the other server again.  Will never return."}
{"text":"This has been the main pho spot the last few years. But this update is similar to Cecilia's review. Was here couple weeks ago after some time. Forgot they were closed for a bit, as it didn't seem any different at all. The note about kids and utensil is a bit weird,imo. Still ok, but service is not the same. The beef last time was almost unchewable. Asked for the bill and was told to go to the front.??? Is it a self serve place now?  Still very busy though."}
{"text":"The Food was overall 2.5 - 3.   The service is very quick & with a party of 7 I give them full credits (5*).  There is too many items on the menu and you do get lost as to what you want to try.  I had the seafood fried rice, seafood fried noodles, shrimp rolls, shrimp on sugar cane, and mix veg with seafood.  Others with me had the beef & soup noodles as well as the pork chop & rice dishes.  Again nothing great."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Incredibly tasty food for a reasonable price. The owner of this place is also friendly and the wait times are not that long, 15 mins max at peak hours. Personal favourites of mine are the duck soup and the fresh pork rolls."}
{"text":"It was hot, it was a good size.  Thai hot pot.  But it was smaller than eglinton and hurontario location.  It could be bigger."}
{"text":"Asked for chicken PHO (soup); with white meat; got dark meat and over cooked spongy pieces of white..  Plus some surprise tripe pieces (gross). Spring rolls were good. Not good compared to all the good PHO around the area.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"I have mostly great things to say about this place  Hence why the 4 stars ..i come here often with a buddy for lunch and we always have great food, and I've never been disappointed.  I've had one issue with not being impressed with the way the waiter cleaned the table in regards to sanitation . BUT I let it pass as I don't wanna give a bad review yet and give them another chance . You can't bash a whole company for one man's mistake right !?!?!?! Or ........ Anyways if I see it happen again I'll let you all know . But for now .....The food is great they have a large menu with tons of choices . And they have fantastic spring rolls !"}
{"text":"I haven't come here for a while. It's a chained Vietnamese restaurant. I used to go to another location often but after the taste of the pho declined and the cleanliness of the dining place got worse, I stopped to go any of these stores. Since my partner insisted to go, we re-visited this place recently.   This time, I ordered the grilled chicken with a fried egg and a steamed egg. The way it looks like similar to the one from 'I Love Pho'. However, the portion is smaller on the grilled chicken. The surface/skin of the steamed egg is dried up, so it tastes like a hard shell covered on top of the rest steamed egg.   My partner ordered the beef balls rice noodles. They served the food very quickly, which is common at other Vietnamese restaurants regardless. The soup base is a bit turbid as you may find in the photo related to this visit on my post. I would say the quality and the taste is about average. However, my partner had a stomachache at night. We are not sure if it is caused by the soup base or the meat.   The price used to be very cheap which I believe it attracted many customers who were usually dinning out like me. Unfortunately, I found the price is pretty much the same now compared to the other similar restaurants. The competitiveness is drastically dropped. After this visit, I am sure my partner won't ask me to go here again."}
{"text":"Really good food! My family and I have been going there for a long time now. Reasonable prices and also great bubble tea!"}
{"text":"I've had meals from their restaurant twice and so far and both experiences have been disappointing.   Meal #1: Fresh roll w/shrimp and Wonton w/rice noodle soup The shrimp roll was good, it tasted freshly made and the dipping sauce was nice. The Wonton soup was average - the wontons were a little chewy but had minimal flavour.  Meal #2: Wonton egg noodle soup, deep fried wonton, deep fried squid with salt This time I ate at their restaurant. The servers seemed distracted - one indicated where to sit with a wave of the hand in a general direction of some seats and then left. When I finally started in on the actual meal it was very disappointing. The deep fried wontons were literally dripping in oil - they left a puddle on the plate. The egg noodle soup was ok, but the broth was weak and the noodles weren't very tasty. The worst part was the deep fried squid with salt - it was dry, tough and had no flavour.  I keep reading about how great the food is at this restaurant and I'm looking for a nice place for a quiet meal in the evening, so I think I'll give it one more shot and try some of the recommendations listed but if it doesn't improve then I'm not going back."}
{"text":"208+11. The vermicelli looked really good too.  I got the med-rare meat & meatball pho and spring rolls.  The broth had a deep flavor but I thought the meat slightly over done but still tender enough.  The menu was a little overwhelming and I was looked upon as the expert and offer the limited amount of advice that I could.  Pho or vermicelli.    A Vietnamese place full of Vietnamese people ... I'm sold."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at this restaurant. I had never tried Vietnamese food before this restaurant.  I personally love their egg, chicken and vegetables. The food is light yet filling, fresh and clean. The staff is very friendly and the food is very good. The restaurant is well decorated and lit. I also like that they have TVs in the restaurant, to keep children entertained. The bathrooms are clean.   The restaurant can be full at peak times, so plan ahead.   The complex also has an accessible entrance for those who need it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga. I have been to this locations many times. I took my dad with me on this Saturday night. Not surprise they were not busy because of the snow ( usually they are pretty busy at weekends). So my dad and I both ordered grilled meat with rice, the rice had strong rice flavour and the meat was well marinated, my dad said that was the best he had so far."}
{"text":"for a first time pho eater, i was a little wary of pho mi. the old school exterior and interior is nothing to be afraid of - these guys haven't had to change a thing, clearly.   menu is super huge and kind of intimidating, but was able to pick out some goodies thanks to our waiter. fresh shrimp rolls were just that - very fresh, very tasty. the crispy deep fried spring rolls were good, nice for sharing.  my mom - fussy, uppity, and white - was IMPRESSED by how quickly our food arrived (10 minutes, max) AND by how hot our soups were. \"I've never had soup this hot in my life,\" - a huge accolade from one of the prissiest women i know.  portions are massive!! i ordered a medium sized spicy seafood pho plate, gave half of my noodles to my sister and STILL had a bunch left over to bring for lunch tomorrow. no complaints.  if you're in the area definitely give them a go. a great, fresh affordable option for lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: typical Vietnamese restaurant   Food:  Sate beef vermicelli:  Wow, was pretty darn bad. I was super hungry and still it was bad. The beef were squarely cut, there was green peppers and pineapple, and onions in it. I've had this dish many times before, and never like this.   Overall: super disappointed. Definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"I am a foodie and I have tried Asian foods of all sorts in many different places. This is one place I won't go back to, ever. We ordered fresh spring rolls, chicken pad thai, shrimp egg noodle, and thai seafood curry with rice. The only thing we could eat without second thought was spring rolls. Everything else was below average quality. We took couple spoonful and packed everything only to put it in garbage. Chicken tasted like it was more than a week stale. All in all 0.5/5 just cause fresh spring rolls were edible.  NEVER GOING BACK, NEVER RECOMMENDING."}
{"text":"I believe this is actually one of the only pho places around my work.  They've been dropping like flies but this one has stuck around.  Like always, pho pilgrimage rules apply to my visit here this time.  So, upon ordering, I noticed they don't have only shrimp fresh rolls so I got pork/shrimp rolls.  I also had their \"special 99\" bowl.  Basically the same as every other place.  The first taste of the broth was quite nice.  I tasted a bunch of basil already in it which was kinda nice.  The broth was alright, but could have used a bit more back end flavour and less salt to compensate (or msg).  The 2nd test was the rare beef.  It was surprisingly still rare (which is how I like it) when I took it out.  After a taste it was definitely one of the better beef slices I've had in a while.  I would still like it ruby red rare though when they bring it out.  I guess they rarely do that anymore?  The rest of the ingredients were alright... The beef balls were kinda nothing special, the tendon was a cake of tendon (I'd rather have it in long chunks), and the brisket was not bad.  The fresh rolls were kinda disappointing.  On one hand, they put basil and noodles in it fresh and you could taste it.  On the other hand... where the heck was the pork and the shrimp?  Hiding?  I think I found some behind a piece of basil?  As far as close to my work goes, this place wins the battle so far."}
{"text":"When it's cold outside its the perfect time for pho. He'll it's always the perfect time for pho. Pho Mi 99 is a chain of pho restaurants around the GTA anywhere from Mississauga to Vaughan (that I've been to).   This location is right beside Vaughan mills in probably the most confusing plaza ever. It's not really easy to find, so just go to where the signs are and turn in.   After finding the place I proceeded to order the shrimp fresh rolls and a special bowl of pho.   The shrimp rolls are one of the best I've ever had.  I guess it helps to have a Vietnamese superstore right next to your restaurant. The rolls were soft, full of basilly flavour and large shrimp. Highly recommended.   The pho was average. I wouldn't pick it out of a crowd. It is worth noting that their portions are fairly sizeable.  It's good to know that each one of Pho Mi 99's locations are unique and have their own tastes in their own way. In my opinion this may be the best Pho Mi 99 I've been to."}
{"text":"Very fast service, good food, excellent value. Among my group I noticed that whether you order pho, vermicelli, or rice, your food always arrives fast - like in 5 minutes. I was starving on this particular day, and the speedy service was a godsend. I liked the spacious and brightly lit interior.  I have a minor complaint about one of the staff. The older lady who works at the cash register (note: older compared to the waitresses) has communication problems or is hard of hearing. When I was telling her which items I was paying for (because our entire group was on one receipt), I had to repeat 3 times before she got what I said. This is an uncommon failure mode, and below the level of service I expect. As for the waiters, I found them to be unremarkable and decent."}
{"text":"This weather is getting brutal so I took advantage of this place being around the corner. Ordered the rare beef pho size medium for takeout. Broth was very good- not in a overly salty way but just very flavourful. They provided quite a large portion of noodles and beef. Usually you get like 3-4 pieces but here it was at least 7-8 good sized pieces.  The beef was a little chewy or weird I duno I just took em out of the soup after not enjoying the first piece. This could have been because the broth wasn't piping hot so it didn't cook quick but it was pretty off putting to chew.   I'd like to try the vermicelli and spring rolls so maybe I'll try that next - I would return :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many many times.  The Pho is amazing, broth is deep, the quantity of beef and noodles is beyond filling.  I can barely finish a medium bowl.  The service is wickedly fast.  By the time the menus are taken away your food arrives.  I've also have had the shrimp spring rolls and BBQ Chicken on rice a few times too.  Both take out and order in.  Each time the quality and portions are amazing ... Plus the value is incredible.  So far this is my GOTO Pho place !!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food and the service. My daughter ordered a dish that was over salted so we sent it back and asked for Pho. They brought it out and didnt bring toppings. When we asked for toppings the server brought them out and I looked like 1/2 of what I got with my pho. Then when I went to pay they wanted to charge the full price of the dish we had sent back. The staff was very rude."}
{"text":"Good selection. I like the crab and shrimp udon with egg. Pho is good! Can't go wrong with noodles"}
{"text":"Vermicelli not made fresh. My vermicelli was served hard. The place is dirty. My friend ordered Pho.. And they're stingy on the fresh herbs. We ordered takeout and received wilting herbs and veggies w our rice. Never going back. Better off driving a bit further and giving business to neighbouring Pho restaurants."}
{"text":"I frequent the Pho Mi 99 in Heartland Town Centre so I thought that this place would be similar. My brother got one of the beef pho #204, and I got the satay chicken vermicelli #432. We split a deep fried spring rolls.   This place gets the 1 star minimum because the spring rolls were actually good! They were #5 on the menu.   The satay chicken vermicelli was bland and tasteless. The noodles were over cooked and I had to add salt, pepper, and use the garlic chilli sauce (provided at the table) to make the bowl taste better. I didn't ask to send it back because we were in a rush, so I just focused on eating the veggies. For some reason the cucumber slices were not crunchy... weird bowl overall.  I tried my brothers soup because I love soup and I like tasting how pho broth differs from place to place. The broth was not flavourful, tasted really watered down, and I was overall disappointed with both of our dishes.  Would not recommend this place. Try Pho Mi 99 in Heartland or Pho Dau Bo in Streetsville instead!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on asian cuisine, nor am I an enthusiast to try out new places for that matter, but when I saw this hole in the wall place made it to insauga's Top lists, I had to try it out for myself. My cousin and I went for lunch and she got a vegetarian spicy tomato pho, while I got their regular steak pho. We were served fresh herbs to add to our meal, which shortly arrived after placing our orders. In short: my pho made me lose interest in trying any other pho places. It was bland, tasteless, and quite frankly barely had any vegetables or beef in it. I was extremely disappointed, as my cousin's pho lacked any flavour as well. It was like eating a watered down version of what could've been a great meal.   TLDR; flavourless pho that made me lose interest in pho altogether; would not revisit."}
{"text":"This place is bang for buck after shopping at Vaughan Mills. The time it takes to order and get your meal is in my opinion faster than waiting for your McDonald's   I usually do the Large house special and it's more than enough for me. Something about the broth is extra delicious. Honestly you can't complain about this place."}
{"text":"The cleanest among the pho99 restos in mississauga. The others are disgusting. Always order the grilled chicken, pork chop,fried egg rice meal with a side of springrolls. Great value all for less than $15"}
{"text":"After eating at this restaurant for many years, it has never disappointed. Pho Mi 99 continues to serve tasty food at a good price. During my last visit, I ordered the Pho Tai (medium rare beef in pho) and my friend ordered the Bun Bo Hue. The pho tai was filled with flavor and the noodles tasted amazing. The bun bo hue was very spicy but the soup tasted delicious. The service is average and the décor is basic). Overall, this restaurant is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"This resturant always never fails to deliver one of the best tasting Pho's in the GTA. The pho is always hot and tasty for everyones liking. However, there is alot of MSG in the soup of the pho and you can get thirsty from it. Other dishes include Bun Bo Hue, Hu tieu my tho are amazing dishes but the main star is the pho. I reccomend this to anyone who loves eating."}
{"text":"I normally come here for the pho, but I decided to try something new. I ordered the Grilled Pork Chop and Fried Egg on Rice. It took a while for the food to come and it looked very appetizing at first. The pork chop didn't taste fresh and neither did the vegetables that came with the dish. The egg was good, but I'm sure no one can make a bad egg. My mom ordered a bowl of pho and normally it comes with a side of bean sprouts and extra vegetables. However, it didn't! My mom had to call the waiter over and tell him she was missing a separate plate of bean sprouts. As I was finishing my meal, I started to feel very queasy. Most of the time when I use the washroom here, there is absolutely no toilet paper. There is also no wifi here. On the other hand, they play rather good music, typically what you'd hear on the radio. I would not recommend this place whatsoever."}
{"text":"I think they renovated and closed for some time (?) but after they came back the food is not as good as it was before. Disappointed...."}
{"text":"Awful. Do not recommend. Only pro is that the staff are actually friendly  I ordered the grilled chicken rice plate. It came with two pieces of grilled chicken, a bowl of rice and a side of some vegetables.   The chicken tasted like it was cooked on a grill that hadn't been cleaned in awhile. The rice was dry and there just wasn't enough side vegetables to help clean my palette from the awful chicken.   The fish sauce that they also gave as a side, was awful.   I have also tried the pho from here which tasted like a heap of metal. Honestly, if you want to have some quality Vietnamese food, don't come here!!"}
{"text":"This is my regular spot for a hot bowl of delicious pho at least once every two weeks. I always order pho tai or sometimes grilled pork and chicken on rice with fried egg. For sides I usually order fresh grilled pork rolls or fried spring rolls which are very delicious!  Service is always very quick and the food comes out fast. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good pho,  low price!  It's a self serve seating, and you select and write down what you want. The waiter than collects your order and literally no more than 5-10 mins later - you get served! Fast service :)"}
{"text":"This location is hidden away, blends with the walls of the plaza.  Door is heavy, stiff.  When we sat down, we took our order. When the server told us we couldn't have our rare beef on the side. Which is unusual, since we always get this done at other locations of the same chain.  Our waitress and the manager, herself was rude and weren't very attentive. I asked the waitress a question and she  walked away because she didn't want to answer it. The manager did nothing whatsoever to assist us with our needs.  When the food came out. It was warm, not hot. The broth was plain, nothing special. There was a lack of utensils, we couldn't get anyone's attentions for more. Which we had to get ourselves from other tables. Also as well; missing condiments.  While we were eating, this other server started to mop around us. She did not even notify us and or put up a wet floor sign.  And when we went to pay for our food, the manager slapped the bill in front of us, slapping things back and forth, rolled her eyes.  We will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"It's a very busy hot spot in the plaza. We were greeted immediately. We were seated down at a not so clean table at first but was moved to a cleaner area.  It was understandable why we got our stuff at a slower pace since they were short staffed, and the place is super busy and the servers were all tending guests and or trying to clear another table for arriving customers.  We ordered an app and two bowls of Pho. I ordered my usual and we got rare beef on the side, since my company likes his beef slightly rare. His very own hot pot in pho broth basically. We got our food fairly fast and are very apologetic when we are missing something.  When we went to cash out, they greeted and dismissed us as if we our one of their own. It is a family run restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here pretty frequent. It's a hit or miss every now and then due to the environment. I guess it depends on which servers who are working. Some are rude and some are not. One server, for example, acted as if he was drunk once and started to yell at passerby and even spat on randoms. Other members of the staff had to calm him down.  The food is always tasty as long as I can remember. There's nothing bad to say about it. Quick service as per usual.  When it comes to cleanliness, not so much, could improve some more."}
{"text":"This place is very busy every Sunday during lunch time! I come here on occasion when i'm in the area. There's a Pho mi 99 near my house as well and tbh they are all the same. Service is fast, there's a line up (short one) but it gets cleared quickly.   A must order are their spring rolls! it good to share and it's super tasty with the dipping sauce. If i'm not ordering a Pho bowl, i usually get the 501... all the time! chicken, pork chop and egg with steamed rice! mmmmmm! for only 8.50! the portion is huge btw.  This is a family place so expect it to be really loud during lunch time on weekends, not a great place to catch up that for sure."}
{"text":"Food here is overall decent and fast. Pho or bun or the rice dishes are all solid picks. Food comes out fast and the servers are quick and efficient. Pricing is about average. Good choice if you are in the Vaughan Mills area."}
{"text":"#YELPGTA #PHO #VIETNAMESECUISINE #INSAUGAFOODSCENE  I've only ever tried the Pho here, but our last visit confirmed that we have to try more next time we are here. The server almost brought a chicken and rice dish to our table that looked amazing. Unfortunately, not our order.   Anyway, Pho Mi 99 is my favourite chain in Mississauga for an occasional pho fix. I'll usually go with my pho-loving girlfriend and we'll sit, drink tea, have pho and chat for hours. I find the small size good enough. And I am a fan of the prices.   Coming back again. Obv."}
{"text":"Amazing. This coming from a person who has never really \"loved loved\" Pho. But I went with a friend, ordered #205 in \"small\" for JUST $5.50 for myself - and I got a massive bowl of beefy pho. Squeezed lime in it and YUMMY, I was in LOVE.   Details:  Ambience: Casual, clean joint located in a central location in a strip mall in Mississauga.  Crowd: The oriental breeds throng this place, but I didn't feel oddly left out. Mostly younger people, 18-30. Plus I shop at Oceans all the time, so what the heck!  Variety: Huge 10 page menu. A lot to choose from. I didn't want to experiment so I just went for rice noodles/beef/pho - all in one - however that works.   Cheap? Yes. Filling? Hell Yes. Yummy? Yup. Going back? Most definitely. Recommending? Don't miss it, y'all."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some pho and this place had good rating from fellow yelpers so I decided to try it out.   The decor was pretty standard but the place was clean and roomy. Despite other comments about the cleanliness of this location,  I found it to be pretty clean and I am very fussy about hygiene.   The pho was nice and hot, the broth was not the best tasting I've ever had but the chef had clearly restricted the use of Msg so I am not complaining about the taste.  The quantity in bowl was adequate but there was hardly any meat.  The  other pho joints that frequently visit have a mouthful of meat in every spoonful. In contrast, this place had around 20% of the meat serving I am used to.   All in all, a pleasant experience with prompt and courteous service.  I would not hesitate awarding tjem a 5 star rating if they increase the meat portions in their pho."}
{"text":"After learning how bad MSG was for me I cut this place out as a regular lunch spot, but still indulge as a special treat when I'm carving Pho, or have a cold and need some soup to help along the way. Love the broth. Love the deep fried spring rolls. And the quick service when you order pho is always a bonus for my busy day. I just wish it was closer."}
{"text":"Pho-Mi 99 serves traditional Vietnamese food.  There are a lot of pho and noodle dishes in the menu, which is typical to an average pho place.  I ordered a Spring Roll and Pork Vermicelli.  It was authenic and fresh.  The pork tasted quite good.  The spring roll was average.  The portion was generous.  The services was fast, effective and friendly.  The one leg up at Pho Mi 99 is the interior decoration.  It is comtemporary and pleasant.  Overall 3 stars.  Add 0.5 star for the pleasant and clean environment."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service was really fast. We got the pork chop on rice, vermicelli, and deep fried squid and everything was so well done and flavorful. We cleaned our plates and left the restaurant full and satisfied. We will definitely come back for more. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Had a Pho craving during the middle of the day and came here out of recommendation of a yelper. I was not disappointed, the food was amazing, quick and was not lacking in quantity. We got the regular, pho, pork chop on rice and deep fried squid. It was seasoned very well and was rich with flavor and juiciness. The staff was very friendly and quick with the orders and was on point with the cleanliness of the restaurant. This is definitely a must eat in here again kinda restaurant. You will see my face here again, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is my go to pho mi 99 and has not failed me yet. The service was really amazingly fast and the food quality and quantity is simply the reason why I return as a customer. The main order was pho soup, pork chop on rice and my must order on the menu the deep fried squid. Everything wad so well done that we scarfed our food like there is no tomorrow. Seasoned and cooked to perfection, the squid is definitely better than most big chain restaurants. If you are shopping around Vaughn Mills, this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place has great soup that is very flavourful and good portion sizes. The pho with chicken, cucumber and tomato is spicy and a great gluten free option because the noodles are made of rice.They also give green tea to everyone when you arrive."}
{"text":"Good food, healthy choices.... very busy restaurant. Went there several times, loooots of items in the menu to choose from.  Cooked/prepared fresh and reasonably priced. A nice place to taste something different....most likely we will go there many more times :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Pho places in my life, and even other Pho Mi 99 locations, and this one just doesn't compare.  Dropped by on a Sunday at 1PM for lunch. The place was packed, but we were lucky enough to be seated immediately. A few groups coming after us had to wait for a little bit, but nothing outrageous. The menu is massive, a la typical Viet-restaurant style. It was a bit difficult flagging down a waiter to give our food order to.  My companions opted for some pho while I ordered a stir-fried noodle along with a soursop shake. The pho arrived quickly in typical fashion, while I had to wait a bit longer for my order. The soursop shake took forever to arrive, about halfway through my food. I understand that sometimes these places intentionally try to get your food order to you before the drink, but that should only be the case because the food is arriving THAT quickly. In this case, it seemed like they were stalling the drink just to accomplish that. Weird.  My stir-fried dish was slightly on the bland side -- very uninteresting. Edible but not particularly enjoyable. I've had much better from other Vietnamese restaurants. As for the pho, the broth was simply salty and devoid of any real beef flavour. Just a touch better than a MSG + water mixture. Disappointing, because I have been to two 99 locations that have both done much better. As for the sour sop shake, it was pretty standard, a touch on the sweeter side. Consistency was good though.  And then it took us awhile to flag someone to get the bill. The waiters don't do a very good job of making themselves accessible.   Overall food and service were the same -- meh."}
{"text":"Decent all-round Vietnamese restaurant. Service is generally quick (not always the most professional or courteous). And the place is pretty big.  As far as the pho goes, it's alright. It tastes good and serving sizes are generous. It is very MSG laden though. The MSG thirst kicks in pretty much right after I step out of the restaurant. I have had a variety of other items, including their dinner combos, stir-fry dishes, rice dishes, and it's all quite decent. The sinh to is quite alright also.  Overall, pretty standard Viet restaurant that you can't really go wrong with, but don't expect to be WOW'd either."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give Pho Mi a try after hearing loads of good reviews from friends. I however didn't have Pho when I went, but rather something called a \"Birds Nest\", this is a chow-mein style noodle shaped like a birds nest with Chicken in the centre of it. This dish can fall along the lines of a Cantonese style chow-mein dish with a little variance to it. The dish I was served was quite good and was everything I expected from this type of dish, while I admittedly haven't had Pho at this restaurant, the party I was with who had ordered Pho were quite satisfied with their dishes. I would definitely give this place a check if you're in the area and want to have Pho."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Ordered their beef brisket soup, Grilled chicken/pork with vermicelli and an order of their spring rolls.  The waiter came three times to ask for our order; he was too anxious!  Our order came 5 minutes after it was given; a BAD sign.  Both soup/vermicelli consisted of re-heated   meats.  Even the spring rolls were reheated!  The place was not crowded.  This dinner was unsatisfactory and we felt cheated by this establishment.  Still hungry, we decided to head over to Burger Factory.  This place gives Vietnamese people a bad name and reputation."}
{"text":"We came here after shopping at vaughan mills. The restaurant was fairly packed on an early Saturday evening. The ambience was your typical pho restaurant with not much decor or any of the fancy furniture. But, as always, I'm here for the food. Our waitress wasn't too energized but she got our orders within a timely manner. I got the \"com tam suon\" (broken rice and grilled pork chop). The pork was way too dry and overcooked. Neither could I taste any seasoning on the pork. There were traces of lemongrass visible. However, I just couldn't taste any of it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pho places in the city. The food is absolutely yuuummy, and they come out of the kitchen VERY fast! It's quite a casual place where you seat yourself and write down your order on a slip of paper, which I personally enjoy. We live very close by so it's become a go-to quick restaurant for my family, and even though we pretty much order the same stuff every time, I am very happy with the large variety of food!   Decor wise, its pretty standard, but it is very clean!"}
{"text":"I have really become a fan of this place as it's become my go to place for Vietnamese in Mississauga.  I usually go for the vermicelli with grilled chicken and fried spring roll.  It's great to wash down with an iced vietnamese coffee.   Service is always super fast here and they seem busy but pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is really popular, the entire restaurant was filled up during lunch hour. I'm not sure why?   I thought the pho was about average. They give lots of noodles but not enough soup in my opinion. The noodles also came stuck together like a brick that needed to be undone."}
{"text":"A few more experiences and I drop it to 2.5-3 stars Service is fast but bare minimum. Meats have been gristley"}
{"text":"My go to viet spot. Prompt service and food every time. My favorite pho in the GTA!  Top picks: - roll your own fresh rolls, with a large meat platter (for 2 people) - glass noodle soup (ask for it dry, soup comes on the side) - any pho or vermicelli bowl!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  Looking at the awesome reviews, I decided to try this place for lunch as my pit stop heading from Waterloo to Markham.  Arriving at around 1:30pm, it was certainly busy, however I was seated in about 5 minutes. The menu book was large with a lot of different variety, which is what I like in Vietnamese restaurants. However, they didn't have iced lemon tea. :(  I ended up having #110. Unfortunately, I realized when I received my food that I made a mistake...I wanted to get a beef stew rice noodle soup, but ended up with egg noodle soup. Oh well, my fault. The egg noodles were decent, though a little hard for what I like (but I won't judge this restaurant on their egg noodles since it was my mistake in the first place). The beef brisket was good, although a few pieces were slightly tough. The tomato soup broth was very tasty, although slightly oily, but that's normal for Pho restaurants. Finally, the carrots didn't have the melting feel that I'm generally accustomed to.  Service was initially very good. I was immediately served tea, given the menu book, and an order sheet. Even after I ordered my meal another employee came up to me and asked if I ordered, in which I answered yes. However, the standard deteriorated when I asked for a glass of water but was not given one, I had to wave down two waiters in order to get my bill, and I never got a thank you from any employees in the end. What would've been a +.5 in the start was lost in the end.  I also noticed my meal wasn't charged tax. $8.50 flat."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service.  I decided to give Pho Mi 99 another shot, this time choosing the Grand Park location since it's closer to Square One. This time, I made sure I ordered the right item.  The setup is similar to the Latimer location, although this location seemed to be somewhat smaller in terms of size. Regardless, the place was full, though I managed to get a seat immediately upon arrival. I ordered the beef stew rice noodle, actually making sure it's the rice noodle this time instead of the egg noodle.  Amazingly, my food arrived within 3 minutes. Yes, I actually timed it...3 minutes. At first I thought it wasn't for me, but the waiter said it was. Sure enough, I tasted the tomato broth and it was actually quite good! The beef stew are smaller chunks than the one at Latimer, which I prefer. The noodles, however, really showed that it was a 3 minute preparation, as it had that \"crunchy\" feeling. I wouldn't have minded waiting another 2-3 minutes if the result were that I'd get firmer noodles in return.  Service in here was much better than the Latimer location. They made sure I get tea, as well as making sure everything was fine with my food, in addition to making sure everything is okay with the bill.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was originally planning to go to Truly Thai, but after failing to find the restaurant (I know where it is now after looking at the Yelp reviews), I decided to come here, as I have generally positive experiences with the Pho Mi 99 chains.  This place was larger than I thought, especially judging from outside it looked like a narrow restaurant. Despite the fact it was full house, I managed to get a seat rather immediately, and I quickly placed my order as I only wanted a quick bite and didn't wanna stay long.  I ordered the seafood rice noodle and a lemon juice soda. It was okay, didn't really stand out but I definitely didn't feel too unsatisfied. The lemon juice soda, I need to emphasize something for people wishing to order this: The waiter/ress will give you the glass and the can about 1/3 full (their glasses can't fit the whole soda). Do NOT pour the soda in, just leave it. The soda overpowered the lemon juice taste so much that when I poured the 1/3 in it tasted nothing like lemon juice at all. It was my mistake, but perhaps more lemon juice is needed, larger glass volume, or just dump the excess soda?  EIther way I don't see myself coming here often, but if I had friends asking me for a good Vietnamese noodle place in Vaughan, I would tell them to consider here."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. My friend and I came in at 9:20 pm after calling ahead to make sure the kitchen was still open. We walked in and were seated immediately, we were asked to order right away because the kitchen was closing at 9:30 (which is understandable). I ordered the pho ga and my friend order chicken fired rice. The orders both came out very quickly. Halfway into our meal we were asked to pay because they were closing the till. At 9:45 we were asked to leave with take out containers because they were closing, I've never expletives that before. I do not recommend this place... horrible!!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot because it was the closest pho place where we used to live. I don't ever remember it being so terrible. My husband ordered the pho sate and it was a thick soup!! Ugh!! Like think fish maw soup thick. Gross. He took one bite and ordered something else. We don't even order the OJ anymore because it's not fresh squeezed. It's out of a box now. We will try not to come back if we can help it."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  As with most cheaper pho places located in \"white\" areas in the GTA it's not the greatest quality.  But i'd come back if we were in the area with no other choice to eat on a time constraint."}
{"text":"I tried this place randomly after shopping at Vaughn Mills and I really enjoyed it! It is pretty basic pho but their menu is really large and they offer a lot more then just pho. I ordered the crab udon noodle soup and my boyfriend had the deep fried wontons; they were both delicious. The soup was so hot that I had to wait at least 15 minutes in order to even try eating it but that hopefully means that it was really fresh. The dumplings were fresh, warm and crisp, overall a great dinner. The service was really nice and quick, which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Not the best Vietnamese food. My brother ordered pho and he asked for extra quail eggs and they charged $2 and only gave him 1 tiny quail egg with his order. 3 stars because I like their hu tieu my tho."}
{"text":"I only gave this place 2 stars because the food is good. Better than most pho restaurants. To be quite honest I would have given this place a 1 star rating, only because the service here is TERRIBLE. 99% of the waiters here are straight up rude, it's like they get mad when you ask for something. Last night I had the worst experience there, I had to ask 3 times for the waiters to bring me cutlery (2 plates and a spoon/fork). 2 times it was the same waiter and the other one was a different waiter. The same guy even brought the food to my table... didnt he even notice that we had no cutlery!? Am I going to eat this food with my hands!? And to top it off, it wasnt even that busy!!! So when the waiter decides to bring us our plates, he gives the smallest plates the place could possibly have! Like seriously!?! How am i supposed to eat off of this?! To give you an idea, only 2 pieces of deep fried salted squid could fit on this plate. Meanwhile, I have 3 big dinner dishes to eat. I had given up at that point, i figured if i would of asked for something again, they would of spit in my drink. These guys were seriously being assholes, it was not cool! I understand that this places gets busy (like most places) and some customers are rude, but that does not mean all customers are rude. I was being polite the whole time I was asking for assistance, but felt like i was being a burden for even asking, or even eating in this restaurant. Ya, last time I go there."}
{"text":"I dont understand how this place is rated lower than the other pho restaurants surrounding it. Must be all these ppl with bad taste who dont know how to criticize viet food. Every time  I come here it always hits the spot. Their broth is always good, reasonable portions and well priced. Their fish sauce is sweet and a little stronger than many other places, but I prefer it a little stronger bc I find that its too weak at most places."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and they have so many great dishes! I used to love the Pho.   Pho is great but it isnt ramen which has much more flavor. My favorite dish from here is the Tom-Yum chicken and vermichelli soup. It have the perfect flavor and its a great chicken meal in the area when you want soup.   They have awesome chicken fried rice and cashew nut chicken as well. They have great food for cheap and this is a great place for groups.   The staff is also friendly and I always order a strawberry bubble tea with my meal. This is the only Pho place I will go to in Mississauga all the others cannot compare."}
{"text":"Overall \"meh\" pho. Not the cheapest, not one of the best. I'd only recommend if you are in the plaza and feel like Pho."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Pho place! The service is fast, and food is cheap like most pho places, but the food was absolutely perfect and delicious. Not to mention, the menu is amazing with almost TOO many options. They make one of the best Beef Stew's I've had at pho, and you can get it as soup or on rice at this restaurant. Love it! Even though there are so many Pho's to try, this is one I will be going out of my way to come back to."}
{"text":"2.5* Not my fav pho, but hey, it's in my 'hood!  (Stopped by here while my usual place, Golden Turtle (Rua Vang), is moving.  The new location will be at the T&T plaza!)  Ordered a small pho ($6) and the broth wasn't very complex or flavourful tasting.  Just okay, slightly on the oily side.  Small at any place usually has a good amount of noodles, but this one was more soup than noodles.  After not visiting here for a few years, I didn't have a 'real' impression of this place on this most recent visit."}
{"text":"The food is subpar. The fish sauce is not salted enough a little too plain for my taste. The soursop milk shake is plain as well. Quite disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Soup noodle really good. Nice, clear and refreshing. Mango drink good. Spring rolls look crispy but were stale tasting.  disappointed there. price cheap."}
{"text":"I was in Mississauga for work, and pho sounded like the perfect thing to eat in the cold weather. A quick Yelp search led me here, and it didn't disappoint.  I ordered the Big Bowl Noodle Soup, which only comes in x-large and includes a combination of chicken and beef. I'm not the best judge of pho, but I thought it was pretty good. The bowl was huge and came with a good amount of toppings. The noodles weren't overcooked, and the broth was very flavorful. In addition to the herbs and spices, I felt that the broth had a good dose of MSG. I personally have no issues with MSG and thought it tasted great, but for those who may be sensitive to MSG, you may want to reconsider eating here.  Also, the scotch bonnet hot sauce is amazing. The sweet flavor of the scotch bonnets made it the perfect condiment to add in the pho. Even if you have problems with MSG, the hot sauce is worth it.  Overall, I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area for work."}
{"text":"The worst vermicelli, fresh spring rolls and rice dishes I've ever had at a pho place. Everything somehow tastes like dishwater and the cutlery is always dirty. So disappointing and waste of a good location. I kept wanting to give it another chance but it was just a waste of my money.  You know it's bad when even the employees were making Kraft Dinner on a stove top at the cash register."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service these guys should know by now that good food's word of mouth will get customers in the door but  excellent experiences will keep them coming back."}
{"text":"went here and really enjoyed the pho, it was super cheap at 6.99 and got a bubble tea for 2.99, will be back with friends!  It was packed with families when I went"}
{"text":"Good food, quite a lot of options to choose. They have a nice clean restaurant, and the staffs are quite friendly."}
{"text":"Renovations are great -- chairs are comfortable, 2 TV flat screens keep u entertained if you're dining alone. Prices are fair.  Service OK not great.  Food is decent if not the most authentic Vietnamese I've ever had."}
{"text":"Decent food, good price.  Lots to like about this place. The portions are great, food is clean and tasty. Wish this place was in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before, but this is just utterly disgusting. Me and my girlfriend got takeout on Thanksgiving day and we found not one, not two, but three hairs, THREE (3) HAIRS. The only explanation I can get from this is that the chef is balding profusely or they dropped the porkchop on the floor and just picked it back up and served it again. What kind of business are they running? I've gone there a couple of times before and it was always good. After this I'm never going back again and I'm telling all my friends to never eat there again. Gross! If I could give lower then one star I really would."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken lemongrass rice.  The chicken was the worse I've ever tasted from a vietnamese restaurant.  Chicken had the texture of chicken used in broth then pan-fried.   It had absolutely no taste what so ever. The pho noodle soup with brisket and well done beef had pieces we did not know what they were. Last time we come here.  Should have known.  Didn't see a single vietnamese in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Great little location for pho. Hit and miss with the service. You may get really good service or really poor service with respect to attentiveness. Don't be afraid to ask the staff a few times for water and tea fillups. I have eaten here several times and they offer great food! Pho 99 special is great, good mix of different meats. I love the rare beef pho with beef balls, very tasty. They have the hoisen sauce, spicy sauces, chop sticks and soup spoons at the table. They provide jasmine tea at the table free of charge! You can ask for more veggie condiments free of charge too. I recently had the seafood Tom yum soup, mild spicy but has a bigger punch then expected. Very delicious choice! Great for opening up the sinuses might I add. I always recommend a medium size, as that is the perfect amount of soup. You have to pay up at the front counter and minimum spend is $20 with CC or debit, otherwise cash only. 4/5 would come again."}
{"text":"Awesome, inexpensive, great value, quick service and quality ingredients! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Vietnamese restaurants and while they were ok, this one is really one of the better ones.  They are very clean, efficient and fast. I've had their Pho with beef which was VERY tasty and the prices are cheap for the amount that you get. I've also had the Bun Bi and it was delicious as well. Great spring rolls too!"}
{"text":"Visited them last Sunday. I really liked the pho here. Not as good as my #1 fave but if you are in Mississauga, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Favourite place to go get pho. If I had a friend or colleague that has never tried this Vietnamese cuisine then this would be the place I would take them to hands down. We ordered the raw beef pho, and satay cube of beef with rice...BEST! So good. Service was good, fast and cheap."}
{"text":"The first thing we noticed when we arrived at Pho Mi 99 today, is that it's no longer Pho Mi 99. The sign outside now says Pho Lam. The doors inside still have the glass frosted with 'Pho Mi 99' but the menus have the new name and are definitely different.  This is only the second time we've been to this location and the last time was a couple of years ago. To be honest, we were pretty underwhelmed the last time which is why we haven't been back. Today, we weren't sure where we were going and when we saw the name change we thought we'd give it a try.  We were greeted immediately after entering the restaurant and were brought menus and tea right away. We ordered and our food arrived within about 5 minutes.  My husband had the My Tho style noodle soup. It was really tasty and had lots of protein in it. He was happy that it had 3 shrimp and 2 quail eggs (most Viet. restaurants in the area only put in 1 egg and 2 shrimp).   I had the Tom Yum soup with beef. It really was quite good. Although it had slices of lean beef, they weren't chewy and tough as they almost always are in Viet. noodle soups. The broth was delicious; just the right balance between, spicy,salty, sweet and sour. There was also a lot of beef in it. It's one of the nicer Tom Yum soups I've had.  The restaurant looked quite clean and so did the bathrooms. Service was efficient, but they didn't notice when we left the lid open on our teapot to signal that we needed more tea. No one ever came back to the table after our food was delivered (not unusual in a Viet. restaurant).   All in all, we had a good experience at Pho Lam and will return to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location (among others) of Pho Mi 99 for probably 12-15 years (maybe even longer).   The restaurant is in a very busy plaza at Hurontario and Eglinton. The parking lot is very big, but also usually quite busy.  The restaurant itself is fairly large, with plenty of seating ranging from tables for two to large round tables that would seat 8-10. It's quite clean and nice and bright.  We've tried many of the items on their extensive menu and haven't been disappointed.  There are many rice dishes, vermicelli dishes, stir fries, noodle soups, congee,  (the list goes on and on) to choose from. As well as lots of freshly made shakes, Vietnamese coffee, etc...  Some of our favourites are...  #113 - My Tho style noodle soup. It has glass noodles, assorted seafood, bbq pork and ground pork.  #512 - Chicken curry with rice. It's not a very saucy curry and has lots of diced onions and sliced green onions. Not too spicy, but quite tasty.  #414 - Vermicelli with spring roll, pork meatballs and shrimp on a sugarcane. Unlike some other Vietnamese restaurants, the shrimp on the sugarcane is a generous portion with plenty of shrimp. The meatballs are a little sweet, but very tasty and the spring rolls are the traditional Vietnamese kind made in a rice wrapper and with plenty of taro inside (delicious).  The service is extremely fast and the servers are friendly, although not all of them speak a lot of English.   When someone asks about Vietnamese restaurants in the Mississauga area, this is always one of the ones we recommend."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this location of Pho Mi 99 for several years.  To be honest, this place has been hit and miss over the years. When they first opened, they were pretty good and we visited a couple of times a month. Over the years though, they started to go downhill and cleanliness was an issue. We noticed a few things that really didn't sit well with us and the bathrooms weren't always clean. This was enough to keep us away for a couple of years. Recently we decided to give them another try and we're glad we did.  The interior has undergone a renovation and looks much nicer, more contemporary and cleaner. The bathrooms were also cleaner on both visits (we've been twice in 2 weeks).  So, I'm now confident in recommending this restaurant. The food is consistent with other locations of Pho Mi 99. In our past couple of visits we've tried the vermicelli, a couple of soups and a rice dish. All were good, tasty and piping hot when they arrived. The soups had plenty of meat/fish in them and the vermicelli had lots of veggies (always something we enjoy). The spring rolls (part of the vermicelli dish) were nice and crispy and made the correct Vietnamese way with rice paper instead of a wheat wrapper.  The service is on par with most local Viet. restaurants and the prices are pretty good for the quality and quantity of food. We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this location of Pho Mi 99 for a few years. It's fairly comparable to the other locations although I'd say the Mississauga locations are consistently better (food and service).  It's located in a plaza right next to Vaughan Mills Mall, so it's really convenient if you want a Vietnamese food fix before or after you shop.  Our favourite dishes are the #113 (tasty, clear broth with glass noodles, assorted meat and seafood), most of the pho choices as the broth is tasty and #414 (vermicelli with grilled meatballs, shrimp on a sugarcane and spring roll). Also, try the iced Viet. coffee with condensed milk. It's awesome.  I definitely wouldn't hesitate recommending this location of Pho Mi 99 for a cheap and cheerful Viet. meal. Prices are great and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood noodle. They are very cheap on the ingredients. Tasted like there was too much msg? Flavouring added to the soup. Not worth the $9 for what you get."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop by here for a quick lunch while heading back home. Wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food they offer! Service is very quick, we ordered two bowls of noodle soup that literally came within 5 minutes!  My friend had the classic pho in large and I had a chicken noodle soup in small. They have four sizes to choose from ranging from small to extra large.   The pho was delicious! The beef balls were very flavorful and the noodles were packed with large pieces of beef and tendon. The chicken noodle soup had a delicious broth that was very aromatic. The dish itself is nice and light and I enjoyed the fresh chicken shreds inside.   The price is cheaper than many Vietnamese noodle joints that I have been too and quality of food is excellent. I'm glad that I found this place and will definitely be coming again the next time I pass by Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Check Your BILL before you pay. I had a Unpleasant dinner here. Everything was okey till bill came on, the bill was not calculated in correct amount twice! We ordered 26.5 after tax but the paper bill shows 42.5. We remind the cashier and she give us a second bill shows 27.5 but still wrong. Then I kindly said it is still not matching the price. The cashier provide me an calculator and yelling at me saying\" then u do the math urself!\" And she did again found out she was wrong. Then she is being very impatient saying 26.5 in total. I am not a guy trying to make advantage but just want to be fair. This kind of service do not even deserve being tipped."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times.  Quick service for a busy place.  But recently was delivered the wrong Bun but ate it anyway because my husband's Bun was  brought to our table and was getting cold waiting for me.  One mishap out of many good times."}
{"text":"Love it here. Good food for good prices. I really like the grilled chicken, cubed beef and mango smoothie.  The restaurant is very clean as well."}
{"text":"In the newest area of the Heartland centre, they opened up a section just for restaurants.  Here you'll find Bubble Tease, Freshii, California Sandwiches, Wild Wing, Marble Slab Creamery, Villa Madina, Tutti Fruiti, Tandori, and Pho Mi 99. Aside from being clean and new, this place does stand out above most Mississauga Pho places.   The restaurant is clean and well kept.  It is new but it seems the staff does take time to keep it well maintained.  It's not luxury dining but it is bright and open.  The tables are spaced out so you're not sitting on your neighbour's lap.   As with most Pho place, it's affordable and quick.  The difference between this place and others is the filling. This place actually has more than just mung bean and rice noodles... it actually have a decent amount of sliced beef!  The beef is not low quality or awful pieces of fat.  Their pho soup isn't not overly oily or salty which is refreshing.  My colleague had the grilled chicken on rice. He said it was tasty but the chicken was slightly on the dry and chewier side.  He doused it with hoisen sauce and it helped it.  The service is the usual for most Asian places. It's efficient and functional.    Overall, it's one of the better places for pho in Mississauga.  It maybe best to the pho soup unless you like your meat on the drier or chewier side."}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong with a Vietnamese restaurant in Vaughan! Most are pretty authentic. Came here's few times after going to Vaughan Mills since it's only on the next plaza.  The food was pretty authentic. My daughters enjoyed the pho need balls there. I usually get the bun there with BBQ pork and spring rolls. For appetizer I usually get the shrimp cold rice rolls. Good service the food comes super fast! This is a great place!"}
{"text":"I agree completely with the first review. Pho here is nothing special.  The broth is very msg heavy but the meats are fresh. Decently priced restaurant.  Getting in and out if the plaza is a bit of a hassle. Overall there are better places in Mississauga but if you're in the neighborhood it makes for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend. Ordered a pho with beef, brisket and tripe, portions were large and lots of meat and noodles. Broth was a little plain but for $7 you can't really complain"}
{"text":"Been there a few times and liked the pho. However, I ordered a grilled pork and chicken on rice for take out and when I got home, I discovered the pork was all bone and fat. I'm very disappointed they would rather save a little money and lose a customer forever."}
{"text":"Located across from of Vaughan Mills mall, Pho Mi is a great place for comfort food after a long day of shopping. Food is reasonably priced and quality is reflective of its price range. Service is average and may be lacking during busier times."}
{"text":"Luckily the food hasn't changed even though the decor has. The decor is a little nauseating but I guess the focus should be the food. As always, the food is quickly made and brought out with minimal delay. The food tastes good without the overpowering MSG taste that some other places have. Parking is ample and getting a table for any group with 6 or less people is easy. The only thing stopping me from giving a full 5 stars is that there's nothing special about this place. Food is good and served efficiently, but there isn't a wow factor."}
{"text":"I went here with a ferocious hankering and quivering with desire for pho.  The steamy treat seemed like just the thing I needed to warm myself up on a cold, snowy night. I was fortunate to be in the company of two Vietnamese friends/pho experts. My experience with pho has been somewhat of a hit and miss lately so I simply couldn't pass up the opportunity to have some Viet-approved pho.    The place is clean and spacious unlike some of my downtown haunts. The food comes out shortly after sprout, lime, and basil is put on the table. The garnish was reasonably fresh. The salt, richness,  and flavour of the broth was well balanced. The noodles seemed just a tad overcooked and good condiment options were lacking if I had to be picky.   The portions are generous and prices are fair. Domestic beer cans start at $4.00. Coffee and interesting desserts are available as well."}
{"text":"Good tasting pho. This is what you'd expect of pho from viet restaurant. I got the Medium which was the size of a large, so definitely recommend ordering Small if you want a medium size. Service is average. Food was served quickly, within 3 mins. Great price too, $8 for the medium size. I would come back again :)  Updated: I got the small bowl for pho, which is much better quantity for one individual. About $6, great price. I would say the quality is average... The slices of beef was thinly sliced and delicious, but I found most of them had too much fat with it. They quickly serve the food within 5 minutes from placing the order. The bean sprouts this time that comes with the pho wasn't as fresh as it should be. By the way, debit and credit cards are only accepted for purchases more than $10. The service is very basic, they take your order and serve you food, then you pay at the counter. I saw one staff dry the utensils on one of the tables - which was pretty loud and clearly interrupted conversations at close by tables.. It's ok though, I'm still happy to go there for a decent $6 bowl of pho :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go aft Vaughan Mills Shopping center closes!! It's right cross at the other side of Mall parking lot. The restaurant is huge n wide open, was surprised how big the space is. We were expecting small Viet restaurant. :):)    This place has one of the BEST pho I have ever had! Their soup is fresh ! Their meat has good taste , the noodles aren't soggy. Also the soup is not overly sweet. I enjoyed it so much that it's def a GO TO place for me . I dug into it so fast forgot to take a pic! The employees were very nice. I was trying to rush out as the resusurant was closing, but they didn't push us out of door at all n let us sit n taking time to eat . A lot Asian place would kick customers out when closing time comes .   Def going back any time I am going for shopping spree. Cheap dinner for 2 ppl around $20"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with 5 adults and a baby and they decided to put us in the sofa area with the highchair in the aisle, even though they were other tables available. Not only did they take forever to get the table and seats wiped down, but the waiters were incredibly crude and did not care whether we stayed at the restaurant, and so i did the right thing and marched right out the door. I'M NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN! The food isn't that good and plus the crappy service, it just isn't worth the frustration!!!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian spring rolls are delicious! But ordered the shrimp with cashews and diced vegetables and it was basically flavourless. Shrimp and vegetables tasted like water. No flavour sauce. Talked to waitress about it and she didn't do anything about it. So not coming back."}
{"text":"I usually go to Pho Do Thi for Vietnamese food, but this time wanted to try somewhere new. I've noticed Pho Mi 99 whenever I visit Guru's or Marble Slab, so that's how I made my choice.  This restaurant is pretty private, whereby the windows are quite covered so that it's difficult to take a see the inside, so when we stepped in I was really surprised as it was nicely decorated (compared to all the hole-in-the wall Vietnamese restaurants that I've seen. Also it was completely packed, and I was lucky to get the last table available. Once we sat down and immediately was given the menu, I noticed that the line of people by the entrance kept growing longer by the minute. It as boiling hot outside that day so the thought of getting the usual Pho was out of the question for me. I decided to risk it and order something different, which was the Vermicelli with grilled chicken.  The service was very quick. We ordered the Vietnamese ice coffee, which was served in a way I've never seen before, whereby they gave a separate glass filled with ice and another glass with some condensed milk and a coffee drip over it. This made the coffee much more strong, which I feel was better.  The food arrived in no time and was served with a side of sauce, which I assume was fish sauce, but not 100% sure. I cannot fully explain in writing how the first taste of the chicken made me feel. That first bite just left me speechless. The chicken was not only extremely juicy and tender, but also the flavour of the marinade/rub was just unbelievable. The chicken had a slight sweet and savoury taste, almost like a teriyaki flavour. The vermicelli noodles were perfectly cooked and not dry, as I assumed they would be without a broth. While eating this amazingness all I was thinking was that I want to eat this everyday.  I am not sure if this dish is as delicious only at Pho Mi 9 or if all Vietnamese restaurants make it as great. I will be visiting other Vietnamese restaurants soon just to find out, but for now, based on my experience and the fact that there was such a big crowd and wait to get a table, makes Pho Mi 99 one great find in Sauga. If you want to eat at a place with a good ambiance and crowd, fair prices, and good and fast service then Pho Mi 99 (on Latimer road) is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for pho in Mississauga. I've had better ones in the past but this one meets my expectations. There's a some inconsistency with the portions every few times I visit however. Sometimes a small runs as an x-small or medium. Broth is nice and flavourful. I wouldn't advise ordering anything else other than Vietnamese and and certain Thai food on their menu though."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 looks a little sketchy from the outside with all the curtains drawn down and the small storefront. I almost want to pass and go somewhere else. But my Friend made me... she has weakness to Pho as I am to sushi so we walked in.   A busy dining room on a Sunday evening always a good sign. Service here is so fast... we got all our food in less than 5 minutes after we ordered!!   Special Pho ($7)  - broth is cleared but flavoured with a hint of herb  - noodle is the dry varieties but was prepared properly   Banh Cuon Lua ($5)  - nice portion for the price  - pork filling was a little bland but overall was quite good as not too many Vietnamese restaurant as that on their regular menu   Fast service, decent food and affordable prices made Pho Mi 99 the place to go if you have a craving for Vietnamese food when you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Pho Mi 99 for years. Fast and Consistent. Always a good experience.  Conveniently located across from Vaughan Mills. Pho Mi 99 is a much better option than eating inside Vaughan Mills food court before or after shopping!  Menu is quite diverse as there are more than just Pho! I like how I can even select what toppings for my Bun Bo Hue.. as I am never a fan of pig's knuckles."}
{"text":"Has lot choices to select from We had ordered chicken Thai curry T17 The dish was very tasty and was well made enjoyed the meals"}
{"text":"2nd visit to this restaurant and still enjoyed the experience. From the friendly staff, the quick arrival of the delicious food to the reasonable prices, you cannot go wrong with this place.  I had #112 which is the house special egg noodle soup. The stock is a tad salty but very tasty.  We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Nice pho place. Lingzi and I always went there to have some hot noodles or soup"}
{"text":"Sorry, this place isn't very good. Got satay beef noodle which came out so cold it couldn't cook the rare beef lol. When I asked them to warm it up, they took it back and added hot water, diluting the flavor. To make things worse, the coconut shake was extremely sweet and artificial. Sigh, we were trying to go to the one on Latimer of the same name which I've visited and it's good. Definitely won't be back here. First time I've not finished my pho"}
{"text":"This place is pimp.  I've been 6 or 7 times now and always forget to review what an awesome place it is.  The service is super fast, and their pho broth is really something special.  My only complaint about this place is their menu is the most confusing thing North of the 403. I swear to god it must be 25 pages long. Instead of just saying \"Beef broth soup- pick your protein\" there is like 12 different menu items listed with each different protein for the soup.  Really a stupid menu layout.  But honestly it doesn't matter because the food is so consistently fantastic. Cannot recommend this place enough.  Oh and its a very clean establishment with great prices!!!  Overall Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Decor 3/5 Location 3/5"}
{"text":"I've come here for many years and I'm usually pleased with the food I get and the service tend to be okay. I came here yesterday and ordered pho which came out warm and not hot and a steaming bowl of hot pho is what we all want right ?  but other than that it was still a good bowl of pho. I also ordered the porkchop and chicken on rice, which was great. I'm giving them a 2/5 stars mainly because of their customer service. There was a sudden rush of customers coming in that evening and the staff seemed stress in finding a table that can fit the group that was coming in, so one of the staff rushed to give us our bill and said \"can you pay now we need the table\" I thought this was so rude. At this point I just finished my meal and was enjoying the the cup of tea I was drinking. This is not how they should be treating their customers and rushing them to leave because they needed a table."}
{"text":"Very busy place, very filling pho and snacks and very affordable. The noodle, meat, soup were very tasty and I was very satisfied with it overall.  The bean sprouts were not fresh when we went there but I'm not a huge fan of raw bean sprouts anyway so I wasn't complaining"}
{"text":"The large is so large it easily feeds two or three people. Broth is tasty, but it was a bit light on the meat given the size of the bowl. (Hence only a three star overall rating.)  Good fresh spring rolls with grilled pork. Shrimp on sugar cane somewhat lackluster."}
{"text":"Un PHO gettable  My vegan sister introduced me to pho last year and I immediately fell in love. We went to some great places in Toronto (where she lives), but I was determined to find a good local spot in Mississauga.  Anyways, I ended up at this Pho Mi 99 location in my search. The interior is simple and clean, and there's a big fish tank and a few TVs so you have something to look at if you get tired of staring at your date/family. It's pretty large, meaning you generally don't have to wait for a table which is a plus.  The Pho here is delicious, huge portion sizes, and at a great price. It's a family run restaurant so sometimes the young daughter is behind the counter and does the cash which is cute (if this is a well thought out plan to make me tip more, it works). The service is really friendly and quick- even for takeout I've never waited more than 10 minutes.  Definitely a must try for new and seasoned pho-lovers."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my most recent visit. I ordered pho and the broth was super oily, yet it tasted bland, and the beef balls were full of chewy matter. Gross. Also I ordered ice water and they gave me warm water. I wouldn't have minded cold water without ice but come on! Plus the food took a while to come out this time."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for lunch to mix things up a bit. It's surprisingly busy on a weekday. I ordered the beef stew with egg noodle soup. The soup base was tasty. However, everything else was quite sub par. I thought the beef was overcooked. The egg noodles were sad looking and too al dente for my liking. For that quality, I thought the price was a bit high. I suggest going to the other Vietnamese restaurants one block over. The prices are comparable and the food is better."}
{"text":"We went to have dinner and they let us to go to pick our booth to sit. After few minutes we sit, it seem they forgot about us until we had to calling them to take the ordering.  We ordered beef soup and spring roll. The spring roll souce came didn't even. In mean time we eat your food, the employee cleaning floor near our table and you can imagine you eating food and smell bleach in same time is awful.  Overall after the food,  they forgot about us and smelling bleach , I'm not sure if we will coming back."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 is everywhere! My favourite location would have to be this one in Heartland. I come here quite often, the employees know my family and I. I always order pho tai and it's just the way I like it. Soup is flavorful and there's enough garnishments. The rare beef has no fat and is laid flat on top of the noodles. Portions are about the same as everywhere else.   MUST GET the deep fried spring rolls. This chain is the only place I know that fries it like that. It's SUPER crispy and it's quite large. 2 rolls @ 3 pieces each. It's packed with a whole lot of flavor and I especially like the amount of taro they put in it. This appetizer comes with fish sauce as the dip.   I tried Vietnamese drip iced coffee recently and it was alright. They didn't put enough condensed milk as the initial mix was way too bitter. I asked for a little more milk and they didn't hesitate to give me more. Added that in and it made it a bit better - though I've tasted better drip coffee before."}
{"text":"For Brampton, it's not bad! The spring rolls are really good. Bun bo hue could use more flavour and the pho was good. Pork chops with rice, huge portion."}
{"text":"Love this family run restaurant! I've come here often growing up in the neighbourhood and they never disappoint. Pho is one of the best comfort foods to me and Pho Mi 99 always has the best in my opinion. You're usually seated here quickly, regardless if the place is full as people tend to finish their meals quickly. Their menu is quite extensive and everything is fresh. Once you flag down the waiter to give him your order, food comes rather quickly afterwards.   I thoroughly enjoy the grilled pork vermicelli bowl and any of their pho is good. The only downside about this place is that the condiments can be sticky from not being cleaned (same for the utensils) but it's something I've gotten used to from frequenting Viet places over the years."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to vietnamese restaurant as I concern about the msg. But I felt like noodle soup when I was in Mississauga last week and found this place on yelp but was feeling that I was taking a risk. To my surprise, this place was so good and it changed my perception of vietnamese food.   The restaurant is spacious and looks very clean. I ordered the small pho with raw beef and I was concerned not enough, but surprisingly, it had lots of meat and noodles. And I had some of the soup and I didn't taste msg. Yay!!  We also ordered the kang kong with beef and it was very tasty and they gave lots of beef.   I think next time when I go to mississauga, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"My favourite phö joint in Mississauga. I love the setting, it's classier than any other phö restaurant I've been to. The broth is so flavourful! Food is always good, was never disappointed."}
{"text":"Got takeout, opened the bag and a nice whomping cockroach scuttled out. DISGUSTING. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"FOOD : wide variety of selection of Thai and Vietnamese food. Food is tasty and delicious! AMBIANCE : simple restaurant. No funfair or attempt to impress. They have TV sets and a huge beautiful well kept aquarium. The place is neat and  clean! SERVICE : Excellent, efficient and very friendly service staff. They also know their food what you ask them specific questions.  PRICE : very reasonable and with generous food serving. LOCATION : convenient and accessible PARKING : Huge plaza parking lot available."}
{"text":"#203 medium!   My personal go to for lunch.   Service is super fast, very courteous, generous portions.  Price can't be beat either."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pho for under 10$. Worth a stop if you want affordable food in the area."}
{"text":"Pho Mi 99 is one of our regular haunts in Brampton and has really never done us wrong in terms of the food quality. We have never eaten in, but have had take out about a half dozen times at this point. Food has been consistently good. We generally have a soup/pho or two for the group and then a couple of side dishes. They have some nice roles and the other dishes we have all had have been pretty good. The price is definitely right and would be better if we did not always over order.  I have hard some negative review of service staff. I have to admit they are pretty abrupt when you order and do seem to give a \"what are you doing here\" attitude. But we come for the food and then we go home, so perhaps our experience is a bit different.  Food prep is pretty quick. Not too quick that makes you think things were not prepared to order, but quick enough that if you are hungry you'll be eating soon enough. I am going to try some of the other Pho places that have popped up in the area and may edit my review at that point, but for now Pho Mi 99 is our place."}
{"text":"Speedy service, generous portions and tasty pho.  Have to say though, the washroom needs to be updated. Wouldn't dare go in again."}
{"text":"Most of my original review still stands - go read that first. :P  Updates:  They were closed for a few weeks for renos/maintenance, and only recently re-opened. My family visited for dinner on the weekend. The restaurant looked pretty much the same - not much change in the dining room. Food was also similar.   But prices all went up. Also this rather passive-aggressive note on the first page of their menu makes them less inviting now... The text says \"Please refrain from allowing children to play with utensils\" - in huge bright yellow letters. How welcoming. They do cram in a small \"Thank You!\"...  as a plea to not be offended, I suppose.  This may no longer be a regular spot for us any more..."}
{"text":"This is the place to fill up your stomach at a very low cost! Me and my sister go here so often that the waiters know us by face and always come up to us and make conversation.  The food here is always served fresh and very quick! My sister always orders pho dac biet every time we dine here while I tend to switch up what I order. I would suggest that you try their dry special 99 noodles (I think that's what it's called)...they offer it in soup or dry...I think the dry tastes better and it always comes with the bowl of soup on the side anyways. You should also try their hu tieu my tho and their spring rolls. Every time I visit, I always order their taro bubble tea...it's cheaper here and tastes better than the Bubble Tease 3 stores down.  You should definitely drop by Pho Mi 99 for lunch or dinner! You will not be disappointed. However, if you do drop by for lunch, there will be a line up but don't be discouraged because the waiters are quick to clear up tables and get you in."}
{"text":"My family and I were planning to eat at Golden Turtle but they have closed down until November. Pho Mi 99 was the next closest pho restaurant so we decided to have lunch here instead. It has been years since I've been back that they've renovated the entire restaurant. It now has a more modern look to it than the last time I visited.  It was quite busy during lunch time but we were seated immediately. 2/3 orders came out first and it seemed like they forgot about my sister. So we had to wave down a server to ask about her pho. At last we all got our food and had lunch! My sister and I both agreed the pho tasted better than the Pho Mi 99 in Heartland. The broth was delicious and we both loved the beef balls! My mom's seafood vermicelli was lacking vermicelli and she said it was alright.  Overall, we were satisfied with our experience at 99 when Golden Turtle was unavailable to serve us some pho."}
{"text":"Always enjoy going here for lunch especially when its cold outside. Ordered their #219 medium and it always fills me up. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Food was good and so was the pricing but I was very disappointed by the service. I had to ask for every single thing.  I ordered the soup . It came out very quick, impressive. I also ordered an entree. Now the server didn't have enough sense to let me finish my big bowl of soup before bringing out my entree. I was just 20% done with my soup when he brought my entree. So then I started rushing through my soup coz I didn't want my entree to be sitting there getting cold. I ended up just having half the bowl of my soup so that I can start with my entree before it gets too cold. I think the server should have cared a little more. Not at all impressed.  Then when my bill came, I thought he would come and collect so that he can bring me change. No one was coming so I just had to leave a 20 while the bill was 16. I didn't feel like giving a 25% tip but whatever. Overall poor , inattentive service."}
{"text":"So don't go in expecting any sort of service here. We went in for dinner. It was 7 of us. We were only given two menus. After we asked someone to take order, I asked for water. The waiter came back with three glasses for a table of seven. I had to ask again. Then I asked for plates twice. The food was also just ehh! Not going to try this place again."}
{"text":"This is a sorry excuse for Pho.  Viet restaurants have reached the point where there are too many that don't try anymore. Soup is bland, ingredients are cheap"}
{"text":"This place is very spacious and good for large groups, I had the large special pho and plate of apps(sausage, ham and nem chua). They forgot the nem chua and they went back and brought it for us. The tea tasted like water. The broth of the pho was not very flavourful either and also sort of had a similar taste to the tea actually lol. The noodle quantity was pretty good. The meat quantity was lacking and it was average quality. If I could rate this out of 10 it would be a 5 or 6 but I couldn't get myself to give it 2 out of 5 stars :)"}
