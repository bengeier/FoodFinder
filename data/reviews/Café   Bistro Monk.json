{"text":"This is a great café. This is even more true given that there is nothing else in the neighborhood that can claim to be a true café. Their espressos and lattes are very good, as it should be.  Regarding the food, you can expect the standard café fare of sandwiches and croissants, which are definitely worthy, but for evenings, they also have a selection of hot meals. While the selection is limited to 4-5 choices, the food is always good and homely, with always a special touch that makes it deserve an extra grade.  The beer, available on tap, is from local brewery Saint-Ambroise, which is a big plus for me. The atmosphere and service is great and kid-friendly as well.  They sometimes have the TVs on, when I would prefer some musical background, but they do show the Habs' games on evenings, so I can't complain too much about the presence of the TV's in the first place."}
{"text":"The café has been open for maybe a year or so in my girlfriend's neighborhood and she wanted to try it out on a quiet afternoon.  It may not look like much on the outside, however the interior has lots of space and is well laid out with a cafe area at the front and a restaurant area with tables in the back section. They serve coffee, tea, beer, wine, sandwiches, lovely small desserts and a small but tasty menu (that I'm assuming changes up depending on the season given their 'organic' focus from what I read on their website).  Both our coffees/cappuccinos were tasty and the small strawberry dessert I ordered hit the spot with just the right amount of custard to go with. My girlfriend ordered a croissant that was heated up in the kitchen. Rather than simply serve my dessert and then bring the croissant after it was heated, she waited and brought both at the same time. Excellent service in that regard.   I'd be happy to venture back and spend an afternoon there working given their free wi-fi and also because its likely the best cafe option in the area."}
{"text":"Cute little café in the Monk area.  Nothing out of this world but a nice place to have some down time in or catch up with a friend in!  I've tried a few things from this place and they've all been ok except for the hot chocolate. This is made by basically heating up boxed hot chocolate you buy from IGA or Provigo (the Quebon type). It was actually the most disappointing hot chocolate I've ever had haha.   Otherwise the ambiance is nice and the place is clean. Only real café on Monk boulevard..."}
{"text":"Since Monk Blvd is quite remote, not that populated I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service, ambiance, and food here. Generally people slack if they don't think they'll get much business anyway.. not so for this little hole in the wall!  They serve liquor, beer, etc. along with coffee (which can either get 1 free refill, or 3 depending on what size you get).  I've tried their cranberry cookie as well as their chocolatier, both fresh and quite good! (make sure you get the chocolatier toasted)   Tried the turkey and mango wrap, also decent, and neatly made and served. I never much frequented cafe's, but at least in my experience food was never so \"neatly\" made and presented.  I agree with other reviews - avoid the chocolate milk because it's *way* too sweet, generic grocery store kind; but thats about the only negative I think of; their service is excellent, ambiance is great, staff hard-working.   Never tried their hot cooked meals, but am planning to treat myself to it soon.  They have var. types of tables and seating arrangements, (one looong bench, some window seats, stools, some more private workspaces) but the place isn't too big either.    Only thing - wifi can be annoying - you may need to log on to it every 30 minutes or so. Still. Love this joint!"}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner last Thursday night, and I was stunned by the subtle décor of the place. It has a great open space, and filled with various antique items.  The servers were friendly and very accommodating, and even offered some kids colouring books for the 3 year old with our party.   They have a liquor license, a cute front terrasse, and seating for large groups in the back. They even have an area selling coffee beans, and gourmet food items.   As for the food, we didn't try their pastries or sandwiches (we were there for dinner), we got a sample of all their table d'hôte suggestions, and everything was decent, but didn't blow my mind.   I think for the time being, I would like to give it another shot, but lunch and coffee might be what I would stick to since it does have a great feel to it."}
{"text":"Dans le sud-ouest de la ville, il n'y a pas beaucoup d'options pour aller prendre un café et donc le Café / Bistro Monk m'a surpris. C'est dans un coin que je connais un peu moins et qui est extrêmement tranquille comparé à mon quartier, et encore plus comparé à des endroits comme le Plateau! Ça aide beaucoup à donner un air bien relax à l'endroit qui aide à profiter du moment. Le jour, vous pouvez y trouver du café, des pâtisseries faites maison (ailleurs, mais quand même maison), des sandwichs, des wraps, des salades, etc. Le soir, j'ai entendu parler que c'est un menu un peu plus complet qui est disponible. À tout moment, ils offrent aussi de la bière en fût (blonde, rousse, blanche - je ne me souviens pas de la sorte). Depuis quelques temps, la terrasse est ouverte et donne vue sur un joli parc. Ils sont aussi internet (Ile sans fil) qui fonctionne très bien. Tout ça mis ensemble, avec un service vraiment super accueillant et chaleureux fait de se petit bistro un petit coin de paradis."}
