{"text":"Wife and I stopped in at this little restaurant in a plaza in Boulder City
I was amazed at the quality and the Value of the meal ! The new england clam chowder was delicious!( not like the potato soup with clams in it you get at the local casinos) but real clam chowder. I had the stuffed pork chop that were moist and tastey .My wife had the crab cake special and they where just as good.
If you are in Boulder City or on way to or from the dam I suggest you stop in and have a meal here."}
{"text":"Great food. We came here often when it was the Bistro. Service was great! Will definitely be back. Also, they have enlarged the place. New owner, Drew, is very accommodating. Give him a call for special requests."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant but the food is not authentic at all we order six different dishes on the menu the Pasta was over cooked the sauce was like tomato sauce with no seasoning very acidic the dessert was horrible not fresh service was OK the chef of the restaurant I guess he's the owner when we told him what we think he got very upset and he said we know nothing about Italian food me my wife and my parents in law are 100% Italian 
 
I well never go there again!!!! Hopefully he will fix his menu and make the food authentic!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, not great food. The \"Picatta Sauce\" was a white sauce with dill.  Not even close!  Just overall, not a good dining experience. Kitchen very slow to get food out. We waited an hour for the food to arrive; and they weren't busy!"}
{"text":"I live in Boulder City and miss the old Bistro when it was good. This joint is ok enough I guess. But for the price, not worth it. Not bad just kind of blah."}
{"text":"GREAT restaurant !! Ate here twice now and enjoyed the salmon and the chicken piccata. So far so good !!! Also, our server Tracy did not stop making us laugh. Great food, great staff. An easy 5 star for me. Can not wait to go back with my family!"}
{"text":"Had a wedding ceremony at Hoover Dam and stopped here on the way back to Las Vegas for a small wedding reception.  Drew, Tracey and the rest of the staff were AMAZING, the food was FABULOUS!  I will eat here anytime I am close to the area."}
{"text":"Coming from Las Vegas, I wasn't super sure what to expect from this restaurant. However, I was over the moon at how amazing the food was. 

The poor reviews were surprising to me, because everything that we had was SO. GOOD. Everything was really unique, but still classic Italian. It wasn't overly done, repetitive Italian, but it really elevated Italian favorites into something that made for an amazing meal. 

The bread was some of the best I've ever had, and I really enjoyed the crab cake appetizer. The Caesar salad that the entree came with was very good, with dressing that was obviously homemade. I had chicken picatta, which was bright, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. 

The service was awesome, they were very attentive and super friendly. Drew, the chef owner, obviously knows what he's doing. He was very sweet and kind. 

I will be making the drive from Vegas to dine here again."}
{"text":"Very good service & the food was excellent. Me and my wife split a poached salmon and each had a house salad.  The food was all excellent.  The tiramisu was wonderful light dessert.  I would recommend this restaurant.  The staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The actual food served was very good with the exception of the bread.  The appetizer bread came very late, only after asking twice for it and was tough, and not edible.  They tried again with the same result.  Dry, stale and overheated.  Main plates:  very good salmon, green beans, and scalloped potatoes, good angel hair pasta and shrimp.  However, the menus did not adequately describe the servings which led to misinformation from the inexperienced waiter as to what was actually on the plate.  Worst part of the dinner was the red wine, it was served warm, not room temp but warm.  Had to put ice in the wine glass to even drink the wine.  This was unacceptable.  I don't know if it is a storage issue or what, but you can't serve wine this way.  We were not the only table to complain about this at the time of our meal.
The menu is not the Bistro.  There is a very limited menu and we were told that we should call a couple days in advance if we want something special."}
{"text":"Very happy with food and service! Waited for several months before trying a new restaurant to get all of the kinks worked out... we have enjoyed all of our meals. Love the daily specials too!!"}
{"text":"We must have gone to a different restaurant than Laura M.  We have lived in Boulder City for over 30 yrs, and dinner at Anthony's Trattoria was one of the worst meal experiences we have every had in BC, slowest service, a 1hr 45 minute wait after our order was taken (not waitress's fault , she really tried).  18 customers jammed in the front room and no food coming out of the kitchen.  When the food finally did arrive, it was less than mediocre.  A real shame, BC deserves better."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend and had the filet mignon with twice baked potato and green beans. It was so good and their bread is amazing too. The waitress was nice and I like the fact they have another seating area now since the bistro was so small inside."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food and seafood. Best Maryland Crab cakes outside of Maryland.  I will come back !"}
{"text":"A-Maze-ing!!  We tried this at the recommendation of a friend and glad we did.  I love these hole-in-the-wall, strip mall restaurants that are legit!  It's located very conveniently to Henderson as it's west of the Boulder City traffic.  I was a little nervous because there were no other cars but we were early.  The basics: It receives the Big A grade from the health department.  The wait staff was friendly and customer service was very good.  The interior was clean and well maintained.  

And the food!  The bread was fresh and hot.  We started with crab cakes and Manhattan clam chowder. Crab cakes were served on a bed of lettuce--like a light salad.  They were perfectly prepared (get used to this comment) and delish.  You don't find the tomato-based Manhattan clam chowder often but it's my fave over the cream-based NE chowder.  I had the ravioli...which was perfectly prepared (when's the last time you had al dente ravioli?).  My wife had the shrimp scampi (you got it--perfectly prepared (I stole a bite or three)).  The entrees were not salty (like a lot of substandard Italian meals) but perfectly seasoned so you could taste the ingredients.  The portions were generous enough to take some home.  We also had some fancy Italian red wine.  I'm no expert but I simply know it was good wine.  We walked out $75 lighter (including tip) so it's not the cheapest but I thought it was a great value because the food was so good and we had a great, unhurried meal.   We'll be back fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"Just not what it used to be, Had dinner tonight all dishs came out very slow and cold, Never got are order correct

My Blacked salmon was very over done (Burned)"}
{"text":"There are some really cool restaurants coming together in Boulder City. Out of all of them Anthony's is our home away from home. Drew is the best host, great chef and makes us feel so welcome! Great food, full bar, great history on the walls too!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night, 4 in our party.
Two had the Thursday lasagna special, one had Angel hair pasta with a cream sauce, and one had blackened salmon.
The service was excellent, despite being busy, drinks were refilled often. The salads were fresh and crisp, and everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Always awesome. Drew and his staff really know how to make you feel welcome. Must try the Manhattan clam chowder. IT is amazing (where else can you get a good Manhattan style clam chowder in Nevada?) the shrimp with mushrooms and cream sauce is excellent.! Prices reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. The employees are not proactive in confirming reservations and, moreover, they lie - a character flaw. On the morning of Sat, July 01 I messaged and emailed (separately) a request for a 9:00p dinner reservation for that evening. Since they open in the late afternoon, I was expecting a return message or email or phone call to confirm later that day. When I hadn't received any confirmation by about 5:00p, I called and reiterated my request. The employee said that a reservation for 8:30p would actually work better since \"they close at 9:30p.\" Um...ok. To me, open until 9:30p means open until 9:30p, but nevertheless we changed our plans and arrived there promptly at 8:30p. We didn't even get out of our car when an employee came out to our car window and said \"the chef has been injured, so we're closing.\" That's it. No apology or offer to re-accommodate us in any way. 

Neither of us in the car accepted this lame excuse because our crap detectors indicated that an empty restaurant on Saturday evening of a holiday weekend = EMPLOYEES WANNA GET OUTTA HERE. The employee was clearly taken aback at our refusal to believe his \"excuse\" for being unable to host and serve us. He absolutely did not know what to say once he realized he had been caught in a lie.

Pro tip to employees: If you want this type of lie to have a better chance of working with customers, say \"the chef has fallen ill.\" This is much easier to bluff than \"the chef has been injured.\"

So, we left and ate at another Boulder City establishment that actually observes its posted days and times of operation. The final part of this story is the bigger issue. The employees clearly had my email address and phone number from my communications to them earlier in the day. They could have contacted me one or more days later to offer apologies and some type of incentive (e.g., free drink or free appetizer) to draw us back to this new business. Did they do so? Of course not. They don't get it. But, no worries. They won't have much longer to \"get it\" as we predict they'll be out of business before 2018. We're locals (17 years) with lots of social connections, and we patronize Boulder City establishments often. We're already actively spreading the word that Anthony's Trattoria has poor ownership, staffing, service, and communication. Sad, but true. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Anthony's several times. We love the food and the personalized service. If you are looking for a great dinner option in Boulder City, you should give Anthony's a try!"}
{"text":"tasty food. cute little hole in the wall, friendly and relaxed enviornment. very nice service tonight, I think they were all new but they all made sure to take care of us"}
{"text":"This is the worst place on the planet the waiter seemed very scared to tell the chef/owner what we asked and when he did the chef yelled obscenities at him and since the place is really small and an open kitchen well everyone can hear him. Everything we ordered was horrible tasting and we had to ask for silverware, water and bread. I felt sorry for the waiter cause the chef/owner gave him shit all the time so even tho we didnt get great service we gave him more than what he deserved. I will tell everyone I know in Vegas that comes to Boulder City not to eat here.  I dont care if the Chef/owner dosent care but his partners might."}
{"text":"Just a wonderful dining spot, small dining area but food is fantastic as Chef prepares the meals in sight, recommend this place for those who want real fresh cooking"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with friends and had a great time on Valentine Day.the food was great as was the service. I would recommend this restaurant any time"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in Boulder City! The blackened salmon and the chicken Marsala are my favorite dishes. The cook is amazing! Very friendly place they treat you like family I feel like I am back home. Tracy was my waitress she had a very bubbly and positive attitude, was always checking on us making sure we had everything we needed! I would rate this restaurant a 10/10 hands down! Definitely an amazing place to try!!!"}
{"text":"First time we have been here since the reopening.  Friendly staff and quick service.  Seafood chowder was delicious and shrimp scampi was right on the money.  Very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The bread is worth the trip alone!  

Great food in a relaxed setting. Worthwhile addition to the Boulder City dining scene!"}
{"text":"I prefer to focus only on places who deserve positive reviews. But I've decided I want to try to help prevent anyone from experiencing what I did last night. This place is what you would consider \"a hole in the wall\", and I actually don't mean that in a negative way. They can be some of the best restaurants. Anyway, we walked in and it was a very small space with about 6 tables, and an open kitchen that extended into the dining area. It was a little different, but has nothing to do with my negative rating. The waiter was a very polite younger guy. The menu was very small, with very limited selection. I inquired about a pasta dish they had, and was told I could order it with a sauce of my choice. My favorite is Alfredo. The pasta was going to include a variety of vegetables, which personally I didn't desire.  I nicely asked the waiter if they'd be willing to make the pasta with just the Alfredo sauce, and not include the vegetables. And I stated if not, then it wasn't a big deal. The waiter asked the chef, and came back to let me know it wasn't a problem. Great, thank you. Our dinners included salad, and eventually I thought bread and oil would be brought as well. It never was, and I assumed since it was such a small place that maybe they didn't have the funding for that type of thing. We received our caesar salad, which looked nothing like the picture someone previously posted. In fact, I don't believe it was a ceasar salad at all. I'm not a lettuce expert but it wasn't romain, the dressing was very odd tasting, and there were no croutons. The salad tasted like I was eating a very sour and bitter grass. In my opinion, it wasn't edible. In fact, I took 2 bites and then set it aside. So as we are sitting at the table waiting for our dinner, the chef starts yelling at our waiter that he doesn't make custom orders. Yep, right in the middle of the restaurant everyone can hear the chef complaining about my simple Alfredo pasta with no vegetables. Now wait a minute...I nicely asked, didn't demand, and I was told it was okay. And I said if it couldn't be done that it wasn't an issue. So now I'm incredibly uncomfortable, embarrassed, and felt unwelcome. I wanted to leave as soon as possible after that; however, because they only have one chef, who is also the owner, cooking for everyone, we waited over an hr just to get our meals. The dinner was nothing special, and certainly not worth the wait. But at least it was edible. After we finished our dinner, I realized that the other tables were given bread and oil. I'm sorry, but that's flat out rude. Whether it was out of spitefulness over a simple Alfredo pasta, or because we weren't \"regulars\" I felt it was very unprofessional and petty that we weren't given something as simple as some bread and oil. And no, it wasn't something extra on the menu you had to order. It was very obvious that we intentionally weren't offered. I even wonder now if we intentionally weren't given caesar salads out of spite. I gave one star because our waiter was very sweet, despite his boss treating him badly numerous times. And one star for the dinner being edible. I've never had such a negative and uncomfortable dining experience. And if the chef/owner only wants to provide friendly service to his \"regulars\", then he shouldn't be open to the general public, only to be a jerk to you and then want your money. If I want to be treated like crap I can get that for free."}
{"text":"Anthony's Trattoria is a new, quaint Little Italian restaurant. When we first entered the owner greeted us and showed us around. They have extended the restaurant and added another room to accommodate additional diners and groups (it was previously a different restaurant and different owner). The main dining room is small and intimate. The kitchen is open so you can see your food being prepared. The owner is from Philadelphia so it has an east coast flare.  The menu changes daily but the owner said if there is something you want from a different day menu, call a day ahead and they will have it for you. I had the stuffed pork chop stuffed with artichoke, spinach and grilled red pepper. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and was juicy and flavorful it came with fresh grilled green beans and homemade mashed potatoes great flavor!. My husband had the shrimp scampi which he really enjoyed too. If your looking for a new place to try, try Anthony's they are ready to make your dining experience as enjoyable as possible."}
{"text":"*Updated review:

Somebody help this joint! 

We gave it three more tries, and have decided to stop coming back. Nothing we've ordered after our first visit (post-The Bistro), has been any good. Tasteless pasta with tasteless sauce. Arrogant inattentive staff. 

The most important thing for a restaurant to have is good food. Otherwise people won't return. The second most important thing a restaurant should have is genuine hospitality. Otherwise people won't return. 

Ditch all the tacky waving statues and banners cluttering the restaurant frontage, and develop good consistent recipes. Please. Boulder City needs more dinner restaurant choices.




We finally got in to try the new place, after searching online several times for a phone number, to no avail. The staff was friendly and attentive although service was a bit spotty. I'll put that down to newness. I overheard that the menu will change daily. The clam chowder was excellent, loaded with tender clams. Some interesting specialty cocktails and wines on the menu.
Wishing them success, as Boulder City needs more dinner options."}
{"text":"This was a great little find on the outskirts of Boulder City. The waiter was very attentive and the chef/owner made sure we enjoyed the food. The portion size was more than adequate. The meal was also a great value, bread and salad included with the entrees. We started with the stuffed mushrooms which were amazing. Caesar salads which were fresh and yummy homemade dressing. The bread is fabulous, but don't get filled up! We had the lasagna and the stuffed pork chop. Both were wonderful. We completed the meal with the cannoli! Would definitely go back. Great food, attentive service and a value!"}
