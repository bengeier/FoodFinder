{"text":"Fiesta- it this word not Spanish? Perhaps there is a similar hindi translation, but this is no combo Indi-Mex food, No. It's strictly run of the mill Indian fast food.  It's decent and not a bad lunch option for people in the building.  Fiesta India moved into Island Food's old spot and is a nice complement to round out the other independent restaurants most of which focus on some sort of Asian cuisine. When you get tired of the fiesta in your mouth from Mission Burrito, head on over to the curry fiesta. Best- Palak Paneer."}
{"text":"Not that you can expect much from a food court. But this place comes no where near replacing the amazing roti that used to be dished out here. The missing mile-long lineup stated what $10 need not have. 

I got some oil-laden eggplant with cold rice and sketchy butter chicken exploding with sugar. Not worth the coin or the detrimental effects it will have on your stomach. Honestly, all I could think of was how much better a Big Mac from the McDonald's would have been."}
{"text":"This is why we have the term \"A-OK.\" While the quality of food isn't terrible, there's nothing on the menu to phone home about (esp. with long distance to India being what it is). They have two-veggie or two-meat or one-veggie-and-one-meat combos starting at $6, and each meal comes with naan, rice and a garden salad.  You can try the mix-it-up combo which gives you two meats and a veg for $7.50. Offers typically include fish masala, butter chicken, channa masala, palak paneer, eggplants and other basics. Not sure why it's called \"Fiesta India\" but a Mex-Indian hybrid would be way more exciting than this.

Obligatory Title Pun: More like SIESTA India.

Menu Readability: Typical neoclassical food court style with pics.

Need to mention:  To answer Kat T's question about the Hindi translation of \"fiesta\": it's fiesta with an Indian accent.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm pretty glib about the use of terms like \"neoclassical\"; that's what got me through university."}
