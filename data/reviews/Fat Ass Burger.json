{"text":"Ordered the pinto bean, mayo, bacon, jalapeno hot dog and it was enjoyable.  Nicely toasted bun with the dog served split.  The burger was a different story.  Ordered the Famous Ass burger I believe it was called.  I grew excited when I saw the homestyle bun.  Not impressed.  I have made a better burger on the stove at home.  I live only 3/4 of a mile from Fat Ass Burgers, but thank god ol' faithful Lucky Boy is right across the street from my apartment."}
{"text":"Interesting signs out made us pull in from off the road while on vacation on with my dad.  The burger patty was decent, nothing special, but nothing bad at all.  Fresh topings and pretty decent fries.  The buns were to DIE FOR.  Seriously, the best bun ive ever had on a burger in my life, and ive eaten at some really amazing burger places.    Good quick stop, very reasonably priced, interesting decor and friendly service.  Will probably stop agai the next time in pheonix"}
{"text":"Went there this weekend with a bunch of friends and we had a blast!  All the food was very good including the fries and they were not Ore-Ida crinkle cut but perfectly salted homemade fries! The owners were friendly and there is so much to see on the walls, we could have been there all day.  Wish it was cooler to sit out on the cute deck, maybe in a month or so! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to eat at Fat Ass Burger today, which just opened.  The sign out front said it was the best burger I'll ever eat.  The sign was terribly wrong.  The Fat Ass Burger was nothing special.  I think they used frozen patties from Costco and the fries were probably Ore-Ida crinkle cut.  Really disappointed to have spent $7, when I could have gotten a better burger and fries up the street at Lucky Boy.  The service, however, was very good.  Really personable and it was ready quickly.  If the owners read this, my suggestions would be:  Get fresh beef...make your own burgers...give me a tasty burger. Make your own fries...potatoes are cheap, easy to throw in a potato cutter and would be much better than what you have now.   I'd love for this place to succeed, as it's in my neighborhood, but unless the food improves significantly, I can't see myself going there again."}
{"text":"Nothing fat about my burger.... In fact a quarter pounder down the street is bigger..... and maybe fresher as its obviously a frozen patty just like mcd's... The service was good and that's the only reason they get 2 stars...."}
{"text":"This place is always closed!  I live in the neighborhood and support local business but cant do it any more.  Ive had lunch twice and both times were dissappointing.  The tacos were on stale tortilla with a very small portion of meat.  The burger and fries were bland.   When it was Two Hippies I was there 5 times a week. I have discovered Lucky Boy right up the street!  Awesome burgers and onion rings!  Americas Tacos rocks on 7th Street!"}
{"text":"meat raw in some parts of the burger, everything was out of a can, nothing fresh, gross."}
{"text":"Please DO NOT associate ALL Two Hippies together, they are independently owned and operated. Apparently not all hippies are created equally!!   I frequent the Two Hippies at 43rd Ave and Bethany Home... awesome hand-tossed pizzas, yummy hot wings, and hand-made burgers at a great price.  Mmmmmm good!"}
