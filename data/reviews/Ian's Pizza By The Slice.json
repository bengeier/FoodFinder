{"text":"If you are looking for something different and delicious, Ian is the place! I love the mac and cheese pizza. It gets very busy at times."}
{"text":"I love Ian's. Having moved to Madison from the Northeast, where pizza-by-the slice is a staple, I was thrilled when Ian's arrived on the scene. I am also very happy for Ian and how well his business is thriving. I am familiar with Ian's conceptual mothership, Antonio's Pizza in Amherst, Massachusetts, so I appreciate inventive pizza. I know Ian's caters to its Midwest, beer-guzzling undergrad crowd with mac 'n' cheese and other heavy slices like the shepherd's pie. But I love Ian's for its 'fresher' recipes, such as black bean-avocado-feta and the kalamata olive tapenade- based mediterranean slices. Lately, I have been somewhat disappointed by the limited availability of these 'fresher' options and especially by the designation of certain of these as \"seasonal.\" I wonder if Ian would consider resurrecting perhaps one of these recipes at a time to rotate throughout the off-seasons. Regardless, Ian's is my favorite quick-eat near campus."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza by the slice with creative choices and great use of sauces. The price is right, and the service is great. I would come back any time."}
{"text":"Super ridiculously delicious and fast; they always feature a nice array of vegetarian options. Often they play loud reggaeton at 1 AM, which is a nice way to re-invigorate and head back out to keep drinking."}
{"text":"This is good pizza. And very affordable. Which is what would convince me to keep coming back to Ian's, if I lived in Madison.   In all honesty, though, it's pizza, which I can make at home loaded with all sorts of weird toppings and flavors, so it's gotta be OUT OF THIS WORLD for me to give a huge thumbs up. So they do have some interesting options, but very few that are like \"whoa, is this pizza or ____?\" (insert other food, e.g. cheeseburger, taco, etc.)  The mac and cheese is worth trying though."}
{"text":"Ian's is fun the first few times you try it, but it gets old fast.  Basically, it's fun because they've got all kinds of 'cute' pizza toppings, like mac n cheese, or burger and fries, or taco.  The reason why it gets old is none of it is really very good, and the pizza itself is shitty.  I mean, I don't even know if they do a plain old cheese slice.  The novelty value runs out fast.  But if you're just out with friends on state street looking for some food after a night of drinking, then it's a lot of fun."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!  We ordered 6 different slices and they were all so tasty!  The friendly staff also helps to make Ian's a great pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Ny pizza, inventive toppings, really, very nice, and good."}
{"text":"I went there only once, but I love it. I sometimes crave for their steak & fries pizza. Madison is so far away from here. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Definitely nothing gourmet about it. Don't go expecting great pizza. Don't go expecting anything remotely traditional. Ian's is basically built for late-night college crowds, and they have positioned themselves brilliantly.   Ian's will put anything on a slice. Beef pot pie, sweet potato and chorizo, Mac and cheese, gyro, Reuben pizza, etc. At $3.75 per slice, it's definitely overpriced, but they serve a niche market and have good locations so they can get away with it. It's sort of a \"must try\" in madison, but again, it's nothing too special."}
{"text":"This was my most frequented restaurant while I lived in Madison.  Sadly, there is nothing like Ian's here in California (psst, Ian, please open up a store in Los Angeles).  At one point I was completely addicted to Ian's.  I have walked two miles in a snowstorm during Thanksgiving week just so I could get an Ian's fix for the day.  The pizza is always good since the staff do a good job in reheating each slice in an oven before serving.  They offer a variety of condiments.  They also have ranch in a fridge behind the counter if you need it.  The staff is always super friendly as well, and most are students or were students at UW-Madison.   My favorite pizza is one of their specials:  The Rajin Cajun Shrimp.  If you see it coming up on their menu, it is a must try.  I special ordered this pizza on my graduation day, and my mom said it was the best pizza she has ever had.  Ian even came out to congratulate me, and they gave me the pizza on the house (I guess it's one of the benefits of being one of their best customers :P).  This is not to say that their other pizzas are not good.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  There have been very few times when I've had a pizza there that I did not think was amazing, and even the sub-par ones are still good compared to other pizza places around the United States.  They have weekly specials, so there is always something new to try.  You can also request dessert pizzas such as the S'mores pizza.  I would have never believed that dessert could taste so good on a pizza until I had it.  I would warn you not to get too attached to any specialty pizza though, since you may love it but it would not end up being popular with the general public.  In my six years eating there, Ian got rid of the breakfast pizza, which was one of my favorites.  I also harassed them for the better part of two years to bring back the \"February Fruitacular,\" which was a dessert pizza with a peanut butter base, strawberries, kiwi, and bananas on top.  It was deliciously sweet and savory with a little honey on top, but sadly they never brought it back.  Their regular specials are all creative blobs of pizza-goodness.  From the traditional Mac N Cheese to their BBQ Steak and Fries, there is always something to fulfill your taste buds at any given time.  I recommend the Philly Cheese Steak with some ranch on top.  Yum!  Note: This place gets really busy late at night and for Kohl Center events."}
{"text":"10 o'clock pm they didn't have any pepperoni heard four people ask for it by the time I got to order they could made pep happens all the time there sorry people don't want all ur made up  pizzas that have been sitting there all day"}
{"text":"Best pizza. Number #1 place I take friends from out of town. Steak and fries & bbq chicken and bacon are my favs! Super awesome!"}
{"text":"Love their Mac and cheese pizza, it's so unique! The employees are always nice, and I love the atmosphere here, even when it's 2 am! Their pizza slices are large, tasty, and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I wanted to like this so much more than I did.  I tried this one last fall and then again this week too.  The pizza looks better than it tastes and it doesn't look great to begin with.  I don't know if I hit the shop at the wrong time both visits but the slices looked way tired.  The mac-n-cheese pizza was very one note and not fresh at all.  On top of everything the staff seem like they are doing you a huge favor letting you order from them.  No customer service at all.  Maybe it's because they mostly deal with college kids and late night bar crawlers?  I won't say don't go.  The mac-n-cheese was a novelty to try.  Please just go in with low expectations and you might get surprised?"}
{"text":"I remember when this place first opened with just Ian working behind the counter.  Thankfully, over the last 5 years people have caught on to his ingenious and delicious approach to pizza.  With so many creative combinations your mouth is never bored.  Ian's is truly one-of-a-kind.  If you've never been there you're doing your mouth and stomach a great injustice.  Go there.  It's fantastic and cheap.  And get the mac and cheese slice."}
{"text":"If you like pizza by the slice you must go to Ian's, whether it's for lunch or after-bar food.  Ian's sets itself apart by being anything but normal.  You will find such pizzas as mac and cheese, Philly cheesesteak, chicken cordon bleu, etc.  Whenever I am back in Madison I stock up on pizza and bring it back to Minneapolis because you simply can't find anything like it anywhere else I have been.  If you're ever passing through the Madison area it is worth the stop.  Check out their website for more information. http://www.iansdelivery.com/"}
{"text":"I LOVE Ian's pizza!  I will say that 99% of the time when the girlfriend and I go to the Saturday farmer's market.  I've not had some of the more crazier slices that they have there, but hey, the pepperoni pizza is still good, too!"}
{"text":"I've never tried it sober, but at 3 o'clock in the morning it's fantastic! The mac 'n cheese is by far my fave, but I've also had others that I loved...just can't remember what they were. ;) Props to the staff for putting up with all the drunks. I've never visited when there wasn't a line out the door. Mostly made up of drunken idiots."}
{"text":"Uber innovative flavors a la mac and cheese, philly cheesesteak, etc.  Bonus: all flavors available by the slice so a group can choose a myriad and sample each others'.  However delectable the toppings the crust is nothing to complain about--crispy without being burnt.  There's another location on State Street as well."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Never had a bad one. They have great salads as well, very fresh. Yummy!"}
{"text":"simply good, wholesome fun (and did I mention delish?!) if you like napoleons dynamite you will love the sausage, fresh sliced and rich in protein"}
{"text":"My friend who goes to Wisconsin told me that I had to try this place because it was the best. If that is true, and it really is the best, then Madison must suck (which, I must admit, is not the impression I left the town with).   They had a nice selection of interesting pizzas. Many looked tasty. I asked for a recommendation and was told to try the Nachos Supreme Pizza. I ordered a slice, at an OUTRAGEOUS $3.50 per, and chowed down. Now it was good, but that is the best adjective that I can give it. Good. I am no stranger to creatively topped pizza. It was good. Eh. I would rather have Dewey's, or Yellow Brick, or even Wing's & Brew (all Columbus, OH references).  If you are visiting and would like some adequate food for a price than go for it. I just wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My co-workers order from here ocassionally and seem to like it.  I just don't  get  all the positive reviews for this place.  In my opinion this is the WORST pizza in Madison."}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza ist ein recht guter Laden,  um auf die Schnelle ein Stück Pizza zu kaufen. Die Pizza ist typisch amerikanisch, sehr fettig und groß.  Ob man komplette Pizzen bestellen kann, bin ich mir nicht sicher.  Aber man kann sich einzelne Stücke aus der Auslage aussuchen.  Man kann die Pizza gleich vor Ort essen. Jedoch ist dieser Platz  nicht besonders einladend. Ian's Pizza ist nichts besonderes aber auch nicht schlecht."}
{"text":"I've been here many a times after the bars close and it's delicious every time.  This is where I had mac n cheese pizza for the first time & I think it's the very best place to get it.    The staff is also always very patient and friendly, which is amazing considering the level of obnoxiousness their customers possess."}
{"text":"Of course, they're best known for the weird stuff. As a transplant from New York who believes that the regular cheese slice is the highest human creation, I am horrified by the idea of mac 'n cheese or taco pizzas or whatever oddities are available on a given day. But what often gets overlooked about Ian's is that their cheese slices are very good. So many places just pile cheese on bread, neglecting the third of the canonical pizza ingredients, and while cheese is delicious, at Ian's they take the sauce seriously as well. In my view, it's the best New York-style slice in town.  I've had a few of the less adventurous specialty slices, and they're good too. But don't let all the hype about all the strange slices, or the image of the place as the place where drunk college students go at 2am, deceive you; Ian's pizza is really good."}
{"text":"Ian's has to be one of the most overrated pizza places I've ever been to -- Heck, I think most of the restaurants in Madison are ridiculously overrated. Maybe I am in the minority as a couple others might say, but some of Ian's \"unique\" pizzas are pretty disgusting (take the Cordon Bleu flavor for one, I couldn't even eat a bite of it without gagging). I also have an issue with the price -- The slices are rather small, but then again, I'm not sure if I want a big slice of Mac and Cheese pizza anyway.  The only charm to this place is the novelty of the awful pizzas (and the fact that they can make a halfway decent traditional pizza), but if anyone wants Ian's again, I'm running out!"}
{"text":"The pizza itself is not very impressive, but they do put pretty good ingredients into their weird concoctions.  Its just that I don't really see the point of eating steak and fries on top of a piece of cardboard.  But it is good sometimes (i.e., when you're hammed)."}
{"text":"How did it take me 10 months in Madison before I found this place?!    I'm a native of NYC, therefore an authority on what makes for a good slice.   Forget the crazy toppings for which they are famous (I'll withhold judgment on that till my next visit) Ian's knows how to make a basic cheese slice, which is the true test of any good pizza.   This is the only place in Madison (so far - the quest continues) that comes even close to a East Coast bite: proper crust, sauce to cheese ratios, and use of oregano.  Plus it's reasonably priced.  If your living in Madison but come from the Northeast of the country, particularly the Tri-state area, and you have that hankering...  I took off a star because they won't deliver to me, even though I live really close and also I've only been once.  Consistency could earn them a better score in the future.  And I'm sure it won't be long till I'm back for more."}
{"text":"This is a must stop if you visit Madison. Weather early in the day or for those late night cravings don't pass it up. So many different slices sometimes it's just best to buy two!"}
{"text":"Years ago, when we first came to Madison, we tired Ian's pizza and found it very uninspiring.  We recently gave it another try, and it's pretty damned good.  I don't know if we just got a bad variety the first time, a bad sample, or if we were just in a bad mood, but I'm really glad we tried it again.  We've eaten there twice in just a few weeks, and both times the pizza was excellent.  It's just like we like it - thin crust, very flavorful sauce, fresh toppings.  We just got a cheese pizza the first time, and it was quite good.  The second time, we got mushrooms and olives, and the flavors were a nice compliment to the pizza itself.  I tried to get garlic and mushrooms, but was told that this location doesn't normally do garlic, which seemed weird.  They offered to give me the cloves or something (I couldn't hear well because I'm a tightwad and have a cheap, crappy cell phone), but I just had them substitute Kalamata olives.  One thing we found was that this pizza doesn't re-heat well in the microwave.  If you have leftovers, fire up your oven the next day to warm them up, and the pizza will be almost as good as new.  The reason I didn't give 5 stars is that both orders were takeout, and the service wasn't exactly enthusiastic.  I arrived early both times, so it's not like my pizzas were getting cold behind the counter while the staff flirted with sorority girls, but some acknowledgement of my existence would have been nice (or at least tell me if I'm standing in the wrong place or something).  I assume it would have been better if I were in line to get slices instead of waiting at the counter to pick something up."}
{"text":"As Far as the Franchise goes, this is probably the busiest location of them all. It can get obnoxiously busy around bar time when about 100 drunk people sprint to this place. yes Madisonian's understand why, because Ian's is SPECTACULAR! They practically have any type of pizza that you want. The other thing is that they area reasonably priced too. They may seem like they are a little on the expensive side at $3.40 - $4.50, but I think that is a fair price. The decor and such of this particular location isn't anything special, just some places to eat and get out. Yeah they have the same theme as the Ian's Franchise but it goes un noticed. I'll have to give this location 5 stars mainly because of the employees. They are so kind and make you feel like one of their friends who came over to a barbecue. I have never had a bad experience here because of them, yes that could change but I am hoping not. Well, keep up the excellent work Ian's Pizza - Frances St."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff, quick service and they go out of their way to use local and organic ingredients!! Locally owned too!!"}
{"text":"I don't even like this pizza when I'm drunk.  I eat it, but I don't like it.  I know everyone thinks Ian's is great because they make such wild and crazy pizzas, but some things were not made to be together.  I've had much better renditions of some of their other pizzas (i.e. pesto pizza) at other restaurants (and in my kitchen) and Ian's finishes dead last."}
{"text":"Everyone should really get the opportunity to experience Ian's pizza. It's work of art...to be devoured, likely at the darkest hour of the night.  If you're looking for traditional slices of pie, I'm sure you can find one or two here. But the real draw to Ian's are the creative concoctions. I think my new fav is the mac n' cheese pizza, which is their best selling slice, and for good reason. Loaded with cheese, this is your slice if you're from Wisconsin - or just a cheese lover. Other candidates for my hunger include the sausage penne alfredo, any of their BBQ slices, and the fajita. They also do monthly special creations such as the gyro or Chicago dog.  Enough reading of my ramblings and go grab a slice. And eat one for me - I'm 971 miles away."}
{"text":"I had no idea this location was here, but we spotted it recently and it adds another option when we're looking for something quick before a women's hockey game.   Coming in from the beltline and getting off on John Nolen, the options for food are slim and none. I can have Noodles and Co. I can drive way off course for a Culvers.   Dig that this Ian's is walking distance to the LaBahn, quick, clean and easy. Had tons of options ready at 6 ish on a Saturday, something other locations can sometimes lag on. But I had my Smokey hot and ready in about 2 mintues, so I was a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Mac n Cheese pizza!!!!!! What else do you want me to write?  This place is good. Not awesome. I think they get so much attention for the ridiculousness of some of their offerings. I mean, Chicago Dog Pizza? Really? I love me a Chicago Dog and I love me some pizza but I'll keep those two separate. I dont need a sliced up hot dog on my pizza. Great job on the mac n cheese pizza though. Very original and pretty damn tasty. When I wake up from my carb coma, I'll write more......"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. The Kalamata Olive Pesto Pie is so amazing, we have called ahead, and if you ask, they will make it so that there are fresh slices to buy when you show up.  The staff is really nice, friendly and helpful. An added bonus to go with the perfect East Coast Style Slice."}
{"text":"Came here on my last visit to Madison to check out UW and had the pleasure of trying out Ian's! Back in CA we don't exactly have decent \"creative\" pizza so when I had a slice of the mac n cheese pizza and another slice of the buffalo chicken, I was sure I died and went to pizza heaven. To top it off, they got some really bomb ranch dip! My friend told me that when he was going to UW, they would try to grab a surplus of ranch and since then, Ian's no longer allows for self serve ranch which is a bust cause I need lots of ranch for my pizza. The line to order wasn't too bad and it didn't take long to get my order either.  Overall it was a great experience to eat at a local joint especially when traveling, definitely would try Ian's again and would recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"I think this place deserve to be in category of its own. Basically, I'm willing to bet that majority of the reviews stem from people who were faced, prowling the streets of Madison after a fun evening out. The staff is nice and it appears to have been expended and remodeled since Bucky Badger University days.  Oh and the mac n cheese pizza is a must try.. the greasy goodness beats any late night, post fun, taco run.. guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Yum with a capital \"y\" here.  I tried their steak BBQ pizza (which sounds sketchy but it was fabulous) and was very impressed. It gets another point, because it shares the same name with my boyfriend that also happens to be quite wonderful. The crust on the bottom stayed crunchy and it didn't get soggy. It only loses a star because their regular plain cheese slice could have be improved because it put too much cheese on it and not enough sauce."}
{"text":"They just have lots of tasty crazy-ass pizzas. Or maybe everyone else is crazy for not doing what Ian's does.  Ian's is one of the places I miss the most about Madison. If you're looking for a plain slice of cheese or pepperoni pizza, don't go here. Go here if you're looking for creative slices and want to try something different.  In the several times I've been to Ian's, I've always enjoyed their macaroni pizzas. For some reason, it just works, although I'd like to see them work in some spiral macaroni in there. I just had a slice of black bean based pizza with feta and avocado, and it was good - not something I would fantasize about during alone time, but good. The other one was macaroni and chicken. Oh baby. That was definitely too-much-information-but-yes-I've-thought-about-this-slice pizza.  Their slices are pretty large too. Normally, I'd be happy with one, but they look so good that I always have to have another.  My least favorite part about going here was the lack of seating, but then I found out that they added another location on State, and I think that has alleviated some traffic."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza and the Greek salad with white vinigaret was prefect. I had the spinach and pesto pizza and it was done perfectly.  I ordered on line and delivery was reasonable with polite drop off.  I will visit every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"There is a huge hype about Ian's pizza at UWMadison. Personally, I have never tried their pizza, but I have been told that it's great by all of my friends on campus. The service is pretty fast, and you will get your order almost instantly since they are just heating up the pizza slice for you. If you are gluten free, no worries: they have got lots of options for you. If you are vegan, go on Mondays since that's when they are selling vegan pizza by the slice, otherwise, you have to buy a 12 inch pizza... I opted to just get their Mediterranean salad without feta cheese with light dressing. It was a really good salad and very filling. The dressing was still too much for me, but I guess I am just being picky.   Be aware. The line at night for this pizza is super long... You can go to Wendy's at that point if you would like since the line there is much shorter and you probably won't really notice if you are drunk."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese pizza is only tasty of mac and cheese if it's fresh.  Otherwise it's dry, like regular mac and cheese.  The pizzas of the week keep this place fresh."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my girlfriend and dude friend!  (3 stars) Starting with the \"meh\" - the service - it wasn't bad, rude, mean, impolite, etc. but it was unenthusiastic. He did, however, throw a serving of salad chicken on my pizzas for $1.50 on request; appreciated that!  (4 stars) Next, the atmosphere was nice. It was very quiet with 4-8 other customers dining in the shop. Granted we were there from 7:15-8:15 on a Tuesday night so not exactly peak hours! In all, the place was clean, calm, warm, and decorated with enough interesting stuff on the walls to inspire conversation.   (5 stars) Finally, and most importantly, the pizza! Bae and I shared 4 slices: Mac&Cheese - Felt like eating a nacho to me. Crazy cheesy and just greasy enough to perfect the crust by making it a bit soggier than normal.  Crab Rangoon - Most interesting pizza of the night - Really captured the \"crab rangoon\" taste and texture in a way that surprised me. Get at least 1 piece to share around with your friends next time you head to Ian's.  Smoked Brisket and Tots - Solid pizza! I would have loaded up for the next few days by taking pizza home if it had more meat.  Penne Alfredo - Jordandal ham was fantastic. Good savory satisfying slice, just like the Smoked Brisket and Tots."}
{"text":"After living in Madison for over a year and standing in line at Ian's pizza at bar close time too many times to count, I have to say I still haven't found anything like it. There is something about that place around 2 AM on a Thursday-Saturday night.  Their pizza is awesome, but maybe tastes even more like heaven simply because of the mass amounts of alcohol consumed prior, who knows. What I do know is that Ian's mac n cheese pizza is hands down the best mac n cheese pizza I've ever had. I've tried other kinds, but let's be honest, when you're drunk it's all about the carbs and the cheese and nothing hits the spot like Ian's mac n cheese with some hot sauce on top!  Plus, standing in line for pizza at 2 AM makes for some serious stranger bonding. I recall everyone in line joining together to sing \"In the Jungle\" along with probably the entire soundtrack to The Lion King once upon a Friday night.   And you always know you've been to Ian's when you have $1 coins that they always give out as change :)"}
{"text":"Don't let their \"sit and reheat\" business model fool you- this is some of the best fast-food pizza I've had outside of Chicago. The staff on Frances St. are super-friendly and attentive, and mystically keep the 1am feeding frenzy line moving at a brisk pace.   I've eaten 17 slices out of Ian's so far and have yet to be disappointed with a single encounter. A+"}
{"text":"Happy birthday Ian's! Thanks for the awesome celebration with games, cake and (of course) pizza. I love coming here, and I'm so sad that I'm graduating soon. One of the first experiences I had with my friends at UW-Madison was participating in an Ian's pizza eating contest, and I haven't had a bad experience since. Keep up the great work feeding hungry college kids! :)"}
{"text":"Ian's has this discount deal where if you buy 9 slices, you get the 10th free. Now, I've been through maybe a dozen of these cards, so there must be something about Ian's that keeps me coming back. Except on a weekend night, because the line goes out the fucking door and around the block.  There isn't anywhere on campus that you could possibly get more bang for your buck. $3.50 for a complete meal. I was devastated when I went abroad and came back to find that they had raised the price of a slice from $3.00 to $3.50, since it puts up much more of a psychological barrier when you break $3. I've bought much less pizza since and never go for 2 specialty slices anymore.   Fortunately, they did this because it basically came down to the choice between cheaping on the pizza dough, or raising the prices. The fact that there's still anywhere that I can get a meal for this cheap is a testament to the steadfastness of Ian's during an economic beat-down.  As you're probably already aware, the premise of this place is that you can get a pizza slice with anything from black beans and guacamole to ham and apples. Every slice comes smothered with soft, delicious, authentic Wisconsin cheese. I highly recommend the Philly Cheesesteak. One of their signature slices, and definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"This is a \"must\" try in Madison. They have expanded their selection over the years to include a salad bar and desserts like puppy chow but the mainstay is still their pizza. Lots and Lots of pizza.  My favorites are their spicy taco, Philly cheese steak, and Buffalo chicken pizza. However, if you have the chance to try their Thanksgiving pizza (once a year in November), you must get it. It is like having a Thanksgiving feast on a pizza all at once. Turkey, stuffings, cranberries, green beans, crispy onions....it is AMAZING.  It's open until bar time so if you're jonesing for a drunk meal or just in the area with friends, stop by if you're hungry for pizza. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ian's is pretty good.  Not my favorite, but decent.  Don't be expected to be knocked out by the flavor--the pizza is pretty bland.  I appreciate that you can get a huge slice for $2.50 for cheese.  It's a great cheap lunch or snack.  The best ting about Ian's is that they use local products when possible."}
{"text":"I'm from NY originally and I have to say that Ian's by the slice seriously rivals most pizza places I've ever eaten at. I wish I had taken some pictures, but admittedly this was a post bar stumble back to the hotel kind of evening so I wasn't in a picture taking mindset. I had the buffalo chicken slice and another with meat and French fries. They were both the most incredibly delicious things I've ever eaten, and that is not just the drinks talking. I wish I had an Ian's by me because I'd be there right now."}
{"text":"They have mac and cheese pizza at this place??  How did I miss that?  Crazy.  Ugh, I'm disappointed in myself.  We came here after a late Friday night, just beating the huge rush of people by a few minutes.  The line was moving so quickly that it was difficult to carefully analyze the pizza, but I settled on what ended up being a piece of barbecue chicken.  It was OK.  I'm not a huge fan of it, but it was good, and I appreciated the free cups of water next to the pizza.  Best part of the place: a guy getting sucker-punched in the face while in line."}
{"text":"I'm in Wisconsin for a month for business and the first place I intended to go was Ians, based purely on Yelp.  I've gone to a few other places but finally decided to go down to see Camp Randall and get some Ians and see if it really is what many people call the best pizza in Madison.  I arrived and despite the fact that the shop was practically empty was ignored for about 10 minutes by the guy making the pizzas.  Yes he obviously saw me but didn't so much as say \"Be with you in a second\" or anything.  Some young college students came in and a girl came out and waited on them promptly.  It was as if they knew I was from Columbus and Buckeyes were second class citizens or something!  I even joked about this later and they did not find it funny.  Despite me talking about how highly they were rated and the like they pretty much were very standoffish and very unwilling to talk.  Ok, so much for customer service, but hey even the best food places can have totally rude help if the food makes up for it right?    Well not here my friends.  I had one slice of the famous mac and cheese pizza.  I LOVE Mac and Cheese and I love Pizza so it seemed like a hard thing to mess up...but it was not what I thought it could have been.  Looking at pictures on Yelp the recurring thing I kept thinking by looking at the Mac and Cheese pizza slices is how dry they looked. I hoped that once I bit into it that there would be cheese sauce or something that would prove me wrong.  But the slices just looked dry and not very cheesy at all.  However, photos can be deceptive, it's the taste that matters.  Well biting into the Mac and Cheese pizza I realized all of my worst fears.  It was tasty macaroni but the slice was very dry and did not taste cheesy in the least.  This is not Mac and Cheese pizza so much as Mac and dough pizza.  As you can see from my picture I sprinkled a dash of hot sauce at the end at the advice of the woman at the counter.  I found out why after tasting the slice that she recommended I do that, because it added some much needed moistness and taste to the slice.    The bottom line is that I threw away about 30% of the slice.  I *NEVER* throw out food, you can ask my girlfriend and/or look at my waistline for proof of that, heh.  But that indeed is what I did in this case.  In hindsight I guess I should have just coated the whole slice in the hot sauce (which was great tasting hot sauce btw) but I didn't want to dilute the purity of the taste of it by doing so and skew my review.  I really wonder if maybe you do have to be kind of drunk and in the moment at 2am for this pizza to taste good because to me it made me question how this place stays in business.  It's certainly not their friendly employees or their tasty food if the Mac and Dough...er Mac and Cheese slice, is any representation.  To be fair Ians does have a LOT of other combinations and I'll bet if I were to try some others I'd be much more impressed but at $3.50 a slice I'm not going to be trying that anytime soon.  Honestly if I lived here I'd probably give them one more chance and that'd be about it.  Maybe I'm too old, maybe I'm too much of a pizza traditionalist or maybe Ians just is highly overrated.  After throwing the last part of my slice away I got into my car and drove back over to Pizza Di Roma, a place that has vastly superior pizza in my opinion.  Sorry Ians, you may be a landmark but you're not on my places to visit if I return to Madison anytime soon!  P.S. - One reason I waited to try this place for so long is I knew it was on campus and I wondered if there'd be a place to park within reasonable walking distance.  There are plenty of places to park in front of the building (about 8 to 10) but they are all metered so have your change ready.  So don't let the fact they are on campus stop you from visiting here if you do want to give them a try."}
{"text":"The guy serving me up slices of pieces said that this was the original Ian's Pizza location. That's always exciting. It was weird though, as soon as we came in, we saw a scraggly looking man at the corner table shouting at the two employees that were towards the back of the establishment. Nothing vulgar, but dude, shhh... there are only 3 (now 5) people here. Why are you yelling? The two employees seemed to act like that was a normal occurrence.  As I looked for a slice that I wanted, I told the guy \"I can't decide, there are too many options!\" To which he replied with, \"that's a good complaint to have!\" Indeed it is. $2.50 for cheese or pepperoni. $3.50 for any other slice. Deal!  My younger brother stole the last mushroom/pepperoni slice by ordering just before me, haha. So I asked if they had anymore and he said he could put mushrooms on any slice. I saw him take a plate of mushrooms and cook them along side the pepperoni slice. But as he piled the shrooms on the slice, he had extra that he just threw away (*insert sad face). I would have totally had all the mushrooms on that slice! Oh well.  The other slice I went with was the buffalo chicken slice, a favorite of mine. My brother loved his Mac & Cheese slice. Regardless of this strange experience, I like Ian's pizza and will continue to frequent any of their locations (I first had them in Milwaukee, and went a lot!). No one has near the selection by the slice that Ian's has."}
{"text":"Fresh mozarella with tomato and pesto = oh God! Thin and crispy. Right amout of fluid on the topping. It's a Wisconsin must try."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!  Lots of interesting pre-made pizza by the generously sized slice (heated in a super-fast oven upon ordering).  No GF by the slice, but a 12\" GF pizza was ready in 10 min.  Just visiting, but I so wish I could get this great of a GF pizza regularly."}
{"text":"We are coming for you Ian's. We are pit-stopped at Vintage around the corner. Two slices I had tasted like gourmet pizza. Reasonably priced and everyone in my group is recommending Ian's to their friends when they visit Madison."}
{"text":"So my husband and I go to Ian's every time we stay in town. We went there TWICE this Friday--one slice before the hockey game and one slice after. We had to return because I was eager to try the fish fry special and they were out on the first trip. Luckily, they had it and it was wonderful. One of the best flavors we've both tried.  Golden nuggets of battered fish, light tartar sauce, and cole slaw that added a nice crunch. Staff was high energy and friendly again."}
{"text":"It's the place all the drunkies go. It's full at bar time and oftentimes, you get stories from just coming in here. See the guy fall over? Maybe a fight outside? You know the drill. Besides that -- this is a mecca of awesome food. It has a variety of flavors with lots of new crazy ideas coming in week after week. The service is fast if you go in and pizza by the slice is quite ideal for the stop-n-go snack."}
{"text":"Hoorah.  This place is late-night-drunk-delight for thousands of Badgers.  Also it happens to be good pizza at any time of the day or night.  Their creations range from lasagna to gyro slices, pepperoni to BBQ cheeseburger... Yes, I am still talking about pizzas.  For reasonable prices, this by the slice (also you can call in orders for whole pizzas) pizza palace will suit your flavor fancy.  Be prepared to stand in line, but its 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Real Good Pizza for Real Good People  I am not sure you can go wrong by grabbing a slice of za from Ian's. I have now been here a couple of times and loved it. You have to try the Mac 'n' Cheese slice mmmm.....yummy.  Ian's has done a good job at hiring HAPPY, FUN, ENERGETIC employees. You can tell that it is a place that takes a little extra effort and cares about the staff and the customers.  You simply have to check this place out."}
{"text":"They do make good pizza. And yes, there are tons of different toppings. But for me, this place is simply overrated. The crust isn't consistent and the cheese can definitely be better. I'd take the Papa John's nearby over this anyday."}
{"text":"When you put macaroni and cheese on a slice of pizza, you're going to have my vote. They do it really well too, with the macaroni not being overwhelming, but rather just an interesting twist on what is otherwise essentially a white pizza.  Otherwise, it's a pretty standard slice shop, although I really appreciated the amount of variety they had available for their slices. Of course, the specialty slices like the mac and cheese ones are a little pricier...I think mine came out to $4 which seemed pricey even by my NYC standards, and certainly for Wisconsin prices. But it's worth it, at least once in a while, or for the novelty.  This location seems to have plenty of seating during the day, although I can imagine it getting a little slammed during the lunch rush, late-night drunk hours, or after football games."}
{"text":"Ian's is my favorite place in Madison to grab some lunch.  I sometimes get the buffalo chicken, or the cordon bleu, but whatever the flavor I seem to pick, I always pick Ian's when I'm in town.  Can't wait to head back in this summer after Drums on Parade!"}
{"text":"College town Pizzeria joint...  ... I should end my review right there.  But no, it's a bit better than that. Yes it might be where drunk young students stumble in at night after a rowdy time at the bar to fill their bellies with some decent pizza. Maybe a can of soda to help it go down in the most delightful way.  On the way here all I heard about from my friends was their ever so popular \"Mac&Cheese\" pizza. I mean with this much reputation sitting on a slice of pizza. I was a bit skeptical, but sure enough, the Mac&Cheese pizza is the truth. I would most definitely order that again next time I'm here.  Anyways, the place is really cool,, all open concept with the cafeteria style system. The staff is very nice, even the hot chic on the check out counter is a nice touch.  I'm all about spot like this. I order, I pay, I get food, I eat, no frills, no gimmicks. Just good honest food to share with friends on a good super day.  Thank you Ian's. I love you!!"}
{"text":"Bought a full pie last night and they charged me $28. I ordered only two different varieties, so they charged me $3.50 for each individual slice in the full pizza. I asked how much just a pepperoni pizza was and he said $14. I said wow, you kinda just ripped me off just because of the way I stated my order and he responded, \"yeah we kind of did.\" I've been to both locations multiple times, and I would suggest going to the one by the capital over this spot. Fresher pizza it seems and much better workers and service."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza place in Madison. Very fast, and every time I go in, all the employees are enthusiastic and make amazing pizza! Smokey the Bandit and their Mac N Cheese pizzas are the best by far! If you are trying to go on a Friday or Saturday night, beware of the long lines!"}
{"text":"If you come to Madison with friends and they don't take you to Ian's, don't consider them friends. (joking..but come on!)   There's a large selection of pizza to order, which are normally ordered by the slice and are placed in the oven. Popular choices include macaroni and cheese and steak and fries.   The people working are really friendly and helpful in suggesting good slices. There's usually good music playing.   Perfect place to visit for a late night munch, post-bars. Seating at times can seem limited because the seating area isn't too big.   They also make salads..but come on who's coming to Ian's for one?"}
{"text":"In IC we have Mesa Pizza, which I'm pretty sure must be a blow-by-blow ripoff of Ian's pizza.  Or maybe the other way around?  I'm guessing the former.  Me and my labbie visited this place as a diversion from worm conference.  I have to say that this place has an excellent cheeseburger pizza, which I find to be a rare feat.  The half dollar pieces for change are kinda fun, but as I get further away from my visit I am increasingly pissed that they enjoy giving out such worthless change."}
{"text":"Best food after bar time, although everyone else agrees and therefore the line is out the door! Mac and cheese pizza is worth the hype, the BBQ chicken is also amazing. Really all the flavors they do really well!"}
{"text":"A Madison original. They now have franchises in Milwaukee and Chicago so they have to be doing something right. The Mac and cheese pizza is delicious and so is papa the bandit. It's a favorite for bar goers after last call."}
{"text":"College flashbacks...and I didn't even go to Madison and it wasn't 2am this time.  I had the chicken cordon bleu and a salad pizza.  Yup I had salad on top of my pizza and it was drizzled with a thick balsamic sauce, pretty freaking awesome.  The cordon bleu was great too.  The bubs went with a BBQ potato cheddar ranch and veggie pizza slice.  Just one bit of the BBQ and I could tell eating that pizza would have been a party in my mouth, so many rich, bold flavors.  You can not have just ONE.    Great pizza crust topped with unheard of combinations.  Pregnant women can get their crazy, unique cravings right here...and no I am NOT pregnant."}
{"text":"My husband and I was visiting Madison for the weekend and he was craving something along the lines of a NY style pizza. We found this place through Yelp and overall, everything was great! Great location being next to the university, great selection of different types of pizza and the customer service was pretty great as well! Being from out of town and being a first timer, the associate working was very helpful with telling us every pizza they had out. We ended up with a 16\" customized with half cheese and half bbq chicken. And ohhhhh man, super tasty! We definitely devoured it. We are moving to Madison soon, so I can definitely say we have found a pretty good pizza place!"}
{"text":"I know many people consider Ian's overrated and costly, but for the options, inventive slices, and fun crowd I dont think I have much to complain about other than somewhat pokey delivery.   The mac n cheese pizza is obviously delightful, but the others, including mozzarella/tomato/basil is a great take on the traditional margerita, the guacamole burrito, and many others are great.  Also, they offer you the option to build your own and this is a great deal for getting exactly what you want.   Not only have I never had a bad slice, but am still in awe of just how cheap the 20\" cheese, pep, or sausage pizzas are...."}
{"text":"While floppy New York style slices are not my usual go to (native Chicagoan clearly) Ian does this style right. I have had many of the different slices, my most recent favorite was their take on Hawaiian pizza which also had jalapeños! Yum!  But seriously, you cannot go wrong at Ian's. There is a slice to please all tastes as well as many veggies options. If you like ranch on pizza be sure to try their homemade ranch dipping sauce! It's awesome.  As for atmosphere, the later you go the busier it will be. However the staff is always friendly and ready to deal with the chaos. Ian's is a madison institution and definitely worth a visit or ten."}
{"text":"Now this was a tasty change from local favorite Glass Nickel Pizza. In fact, I think we'll make the drive to Ian's from now on. The crust was cripsy, but not dry. And we left feeling full but not gross. There's definitely something for everyone. The salad was delish too!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is awesome. Every time I am in Madison I make a point to try and go here. It is very reminiscent of my college days. Even though I went to school on the East Coast all college pizza joints have the same ambiance, crowd, ratio of drunk-to-sober people, etc.  What makes Ian's stand out is the creativity and variety they offer in their pizza selection. I'm both thankful and envious that there wasn't a location close to me when I was in school. The ability to get Mac and Cheese Pizza at 2 am after leaving the bars would be a blessing and a curse. That being said, if you are in the Madison area you must try a slice. The mid-west gets a bad rap for pizza but I would prefer Ian's over most of the pizza joints around my college in New England. That should say something.   My only complaint is that some of the pizza is quite dry. But the toppings make up for that.  Keep doing you, Ian's. And maybe think about expanding to Maryland. I have a feeling you'd do really well :)"}
{"text":"Only a slice and I am already a fan.  This pizza was the closest I got to the one you get in places that sell it by the slice in Milan. Actually it is slightly better that the average Milanese place.  Now if you ask a true Neapolitan he might think this is not real pizza, but to me this is pizza. The kind of everyday, slice-for-lunch sort of pizza, not  the special, whole pie dinner kind of pizza, but still I am very happy I will have this place close to work! It will save me when I crave a slice of carbs topped with awesome melted fats!"}
{"text":"Packed and loud with quick service and nowhere to sit is the best way to describe this place. The pizza is satisfying and the selection is huge...but with all the toppings and sauces and dressings and chaos, it is best enjoyed while drunk."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good.  However, the workers need to use pizza slice servers instead of picking up the pizza with their bare hands. This was disgusting to me and at one point my mother saw one of the workers sweeping the floors and the next minute he was organizing the pizza slices with his bare hands. Honestly, I haven't had Ian's pizza in over 7 years since I last visited Madison. I probably won't return until the workers start using the proper equipment to handle the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it. But I don't like it. I don't get the appeal, especially of their \"specialty\" slices. Most of them look like triangular barf - and when I've been out drinking for hours and want drunk food, I definitely don't want something that looks like barf."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week and it's pretty much always packed, but not like packed packed that I have seen at 2am. Holy moly! Don't even try it unless you are absolutely starving 'cause that line doubles and goes all around. At that time of the hour your better off ordering a small, medium, or large to go; skip the line.   My favorites are their Mac n cheese (of course), chorizo quesadilla, brisket tater tot, penne alfredo, and spinach feta pesto. The jerk chicken pizza sounded really good, but it was such a disappointment. The jerk chicken was seasoned to perfection and would have tasted amazing all on its own, but paired with rice and beans on a pizza just made it a soggy mess. I would call it a soup pizza.  Also, their breakfast pizzas on Saturday mornings are worth trying at least once. I have had their huevos rancheros slice, which was alright. If you're a fan of biscuits and gravy, I wouldn't miss out on the biscuits and gravy slice; worth trying.   Can't beat a pizza slice place that's open til 3am!"}
{"text":"What's the difference between the superficial owner of this place, and a night when girls pretend to be scary but actually just wear almost nothing?  One is Halloween, the other is Shallowian.  What to get: Spinach Feta slice What not ot get: Feta and feta because you ate too much pizza  I had heard all about Ian's Pizza and had been told about it, but in the end it's really just a good standard College Pizza. Not spectacular by any means. The chicken barbecue slice was nothing special at all - although it wasn't bad.  The pepperoni slice was better, although it had nothing on the pepperoni available in places like Buffalo and Detroit. And it was really really really really greasy. Which isn't usually a bad thing, but the taste needs to at least match the grease level to make it worth it.   However the winner was the feta and spinach sliced. It was the one which the cute girl working here told me to get - although it's not as popular as the others, she said it was her personal favourite. Well she has good taste because this slice was excellent. In fact good enough for me to give it 5 Stars except for the rather ridiculous pricing of $4 for a slice. Which is the reason I'm keeping it at 4. It's just about 5-star pizza if you get the right slice. Most slices are 4-star or less. And the pricing is just too much. Buffalo and Detroit slices are 10x as good and half the price.  A couple of bonus things are that the crust is really hard and delicious, which really makes the pizza, rather the basic crap bread. It's cooked well and to perfection unlike a lot of the soggy bread you find around the country. A second point is that a lot of pretty girls come here for slices. It's an awesome place to flirt and people watch.  But if someone stares deep into your eyes and won't stop, they're not people watching. They're \"Pupil watching.\" And you should remind them to retina sense of decency and not do that anymore. Iris people would listen to advice, but they don't."}
{"text":"Ok, regardless of whether you like NYC thin crust or Chicago deep dish, THERE IS NO GOOD PIZZA IN MADISON.  PERIOD.  NADA.  NONE.  NOWHERE.  THE PIZZA IN MADISON SUCKS.  Now, that I have that off my chest, I cannot live without pizza.  So, a compromise is necessary.  You're going to have to settle.  We get Ian's plain cheese pizza.  Never tried any of their crazy flavors and never will; they're pure heresy.  And I've never eaten there.  We always get it delivered or take out.  All of that being said, this is the only edible pizza in Madison.  Glass Nickel sucks.  Roman Candle?  Only in a pinch.  Lombardino's isn't even worth considering.  Greenbush?  Funny, I don't remember ordering charcoal as a topping.  So, this is the best you can do here.  One of the great tragedies of living in Madison.  (So, what is the best pizza in the world?  John's on Bleecker St. in Manhattan, of course, but they don't deliver.)"}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak pizza. Enough said. Add a little bit of barbecue sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Then repeat.  You might as well buy two and skip getting back in line.   If you're not a fan of cheesesteak, or prefer not to eat meat, grab a slice of Mac and Cheese, and Portabello Pesto and add the same treatment.  My boyfriend is partial to Steak and Fries, which is just as it sounds with barbecue sauce, which is my former favorite. Just go and check it out. Ask for the special of the week, if you are really feeling adventerous, the Ian's guys are really fun and friendly and will show you the way."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for a few slices on a Friday night after an exhausting day of record shopping and the place was reasonably busy. The setup was a little confusing, but after a few seconds we figured out that the line starts on the left, you pick your slice of pizza (I didn't see any plain or pepperoni slices on display.) They pop those suckers into the oven while you pay and get your drink. It gets a bit hectic on the end while waiting for your slices, because a hungry crowd gathers there and the space is further congested by having people use the soda fountain and dumping their used dishes. The people working the counter seemed a bit stressed and messed up my order. Fortunately, it was in my favor. They gave me an extra slice I didn't order and it was the best slice in the house: Mac and cheese! I felt bad, gave back the extra slice I didn't order and began to enjoy the delicious mac and cheese slice. The crust is pretty close to perfect and they use a delicious mix of ricotta and cheddar cheeses, swirled with macaroni pasta and slathered on a slice of crusty goodness. This was well worth having to endure the terrible 90's music mix and congested waiting area. Not to forget, the soda fountain had a nice selection, including ginger ale--something rarely seen at a soda fountain. I recommend for a quick-bite, late night slice spot!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best bbq pizza I have ever had.  Briskett and tots.  Did not know what to expect but it was amazing.  Need to get some again soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing and fun pizza. If you go here expecting deep dish or traditional pizzas, you will not like it. If you're an adventurous eater and want to try different pizzas, this is the place for you. Need to try the Chicago location."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and get full on some pizza, particularly after a cold evening of enjoying the bars and tromping around in the snow. You'll read about the creative pizzas they have (Mac'n'Cheese).  It is a bit crazy with drunken university students, but if you get past that bit, it's an enjoyable and warm stop on the way home!"}
{"text":"Went there during Wisco graduation, we were taken there by our nephew who said this is a must!! We were not disappointed. Awesome unusual slices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Friends of ours were visiting for the weekend, one was also a fellow alumnus, and what brings college nostalgia back better than eating at the 2am drunk spot? Ian's pizza was that spot for many a UW graduate but we were spoiled because it is a damn good slice of pizza drunk or sober.   The beef pot pie slice, yes beef pot pie - was so tasty. Crunchy crust with shredded, tender beef, a bit of potato, brown gravy for the sauce, onion, and we put this tangy sweet BBQ sauce on sparingly as well. There was also the Mac n cheese slice that I was told was very good.  We walked three miles that day, so we had good balance - which is key when choosing to eat at a place like Ian's."}
{"text":"Whenever I am on the run looking for a fix it's a sweet place to stop by. Such a Wisconsin oriented place to be and the pizza isn't too expensive. They have a young staff and stay open late for the drunchies. Don't pass it up if you're swinging through Madison for a weekend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places downtown. Cheap, delicious pizza for anyone in the family. You walk into a large dining area with a lot of seating. The lines are usually pretty long but they go fast. The staff is very knowledgable about the pizza and if you ask for recommendations they are always willing to help. The pizza selection is out of this world. There is mac and cheese, which is my favorite, and so much more! The combinations sound interesting but believe me they are the best. You go through the line and order your slice, or slices. The staff puts them into the gigantic ovens behind them and you move on to pay. You wait 5-10 minutes to get your slice, which is not long at all. You can grab some water and stare at all the cool artwork they have on the walls.   The slices are hot when you get them with the cheese oozing off of the sides of the slice. It is the most amazing experience, from the time you walk in to the time you leave and are thanked for coming in. I have never been disappointed with any slice I choose. They are also very accommodating to special orders if you are vegan or want a different veggie slice that isn't available at the time. I recommend calling ahead for any specialty pizza as it can take a little while for the pizza guys to make it with the rush of people that is usually there. I love coming here for cheap fast pizza on the go. Great people, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Want unusual pizza? Then you have found the right pizza joint. Friendly welcoming staff. Who will show you the ropes if its your first time. My favorite is the Mac N Cheese. It brings me back to Grandma's house when I would  eat mac n cheese(with Ketchup) for lunch every Saturday. Who doesn't love it when a place brings back childhood memories? A Must Stop!"}
{"text":"MAC & CHEESE PIZZA!!!! Who would've thought??!?!?!  This is something that you must try if you are in the area!!  It's actually really good.  Also good - Steak and potatos pizza & the Philly cheesesteak"}
{"text":"How anyone doesn't get the appeal of Ian's is beyond me. I'm with Kate - living 3000 miles away makes you want your college days back., specifically so you can hit up Ian's at 2a.  The mac & cheese pizza is amazingly good. Oh sweet Ian."}
{"text":"For all you Gopher fans this is the Mesa Pizza equivalent. Pretty decent stuff, and pretty much comparable, just be warned if you come into this establishment wearing Gopher gear expect heckling. Don't be offended, it's just the nature of the environment, Wisconsin has no class."}
{"text":"Love love love. Not just the pizza, as usual, but the location!  I have never ventured to this location and it was SO empty!  The selection was not as large, but who cares if you don't have to wait in line?  The people were friendly and I love the new check outs on the iPads. Love love love."}
{"text":"If you want a mid-western cultural take on the good ole college town stand-bye, this is your joint.  Their unique selection, as other reviewers have mentioned, is what makes this place worthwhile. If you just want pepperoni, aint' nothing different here than at Papa Johns or any other chain, it seems.   Their location(s) right by campus also help their popularity."}
{"text":"We went late on a Saturday night in the summer and this place was PACKED! Line almost out the door of college students and young adults. However, they kept it moving really quickly. Everyone in my group had the Mac and cheese pizza, which was like $3 or  $4 per slice, which was a little pricey IMO. It didn't have traditional pizza tomato sauce. I personally thought it was long on cheese and short on Mac--I had like four noodles on mine so it was like eating pizza crust with cheese on it. However, it was a really good crust! Great texture and folded well. A thin crust that was on the crisper side. Also, the pizza wasn't really greasy.  The bathroom situation was not ideal. It was pretty clean, but if you're going for the late night post-bars clientele, drunk girls = frequent trips to the bathroom. Line was long since it's only a one seater. Would recommend expanding the bathroom in the future."}
{"text":"Came here before going out for the night. If I could sum up Ian's, I would say it probably tastes 100x better after being out and drinking. I had the Mac n Cheese slice, and some slice with eggplant and olive tapenade. The Mac n Cheese slice tasted just like Mac n Cheese on a slice of pizza dough. I had expected some sort of Cheesy sauce for the pizza (like an Alfredo style sauce), but felt more that the Mac n Cheese and pizza slice were made separately, and then just combined together after.   The eggplant and olive tapenade slice was pretty good, and had a good balance of flavors. Maybe it was just the time I came in, but the pizza did not seem as fresh as it could have been.   Was definitely tasty though, and still didn't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"There is simply nothing better than Mac & Cheese pizza when you are drunk at 2 a.m.  Nothing.  Ever.  In life.  I like their other slices (some more than others), but not enough to warrant 5 stars.  The Mac & Cheese pizza can have 5 stars, though, and also my first born child.  It gets crazy busy with drunk people late at night (biiiiig lines), but they're good at paring down the line quickly while dealing with drunken hijinks."}
{"text":"Family friendly. The wait at Dotty's was 40 min. We popped into Ian's, grabbed a quick and tasty slice and the kids got to go swimming sooner! Ian's have a nice variety of pizzas and salads to suit everybody's tastes. The slices are big, I got one and rest of my Fam got 2 slices.  The staff are exuberant, informative and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend on Saturday afternoon after seeing the mac & cheese pizza on Diners Drive Ins... Every slice we tried exceeded our taste expectations. The Mac and cheese was my favorite, and the crust was top notch. My friend loved the Ravioli one. We will definitely visit again on our next trip to Madison. ... Staff was super nice too!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Ian's since I lived off Mesa in MPLS for most of college. We went a little before 1a & the place was already packed. They had limited choices at that time of the hour but all of them still delicious. I was jonesing the Chili Cheese Frito pizza but settled for Chicken Taco since they were out. Just as good as it sounds!   Going to Ian's this weekend made me appreciate that we have Mesa so much more!"}
{"text":"I know it isn't the greatest pizza in the world, but it isn't really about being pizza. This is more like a streamlined delivery device for everything from steak to mexican to classic comfort foods.  Ian's is quintessential part of being a UW student, especially with the demise of so many other of the campus area's late night pizza joints. Craziest slice I ever had there was a one-off they had created at lunch. It was poached pear with walnuts, brie, and microgreens. I think. That's close at least."}
{"text":"You must experience Ian's at least once! Yummy pizza with large slices and awesome flavor combinations. I've had so many slices while in college including Mac & Cheese (awesome!), steak & fries, BBQ chicken pineapple, buffalo chicken, penne pasta, Florentine, cheese and pepperoni. Mac & Cheese used to be my favorite, but now it is Florentine.  When I was a freshman, I would have rated this place 5 stars, but it has since lost its novelty. I've just eaten here too much."}
{"text":"I can understand why this is a hometown favorite. It has a little bit of everything to please everybody. Even my daughter who has a food allergy was able to eat her pizza with the rest of us. They can make a gluten free dough with a vegan cheese and she also had it with Italian sausage. Our group of 6 had 6 different kind of slices and not one was disappointed. Definitely worth giving them another try the next time I'm in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"I am not a huge pizza fan so that may influence my review a little bit.   I have only been to Ian's once, around bar time on a weekend night.  The line was of course out the door, and filled with drunk people.  I didn't mind the wait at all.  The pizza was good, nothing I crave or anything, but it was good.  The workers were frantically slaving away in the kitchen.  The pizza I wanted was taken by the man in line in front of me so I quickly chose some Hawaiian style pizza that caught my eye.    Either way, I was hungry and wasn't about to have them make me a slice specially for me. Great for drunk munchies.... not sure I would go here sober."}
{"text":"Got the mac and cheese pizza!  Man, was it tasty.. and you would think it's too many carbs, with the mac plus the pizza, but the pizza is super thin and flaky.  I actually wish I could have tried the caprese pizza (basil, moz, and tomato), but i was too full!"}
{"text":"Ian's is a Madison staple - and I enjoy my $3 slice whether I'm eating it as my dinner at 6 p.m. or just a booze-sponge around 2 a.m.  Those looking for an authentic Neapolitan pizza might be disappointed. I mean, my last order at Ian's was for a slice of Mac and Cheese and a slice of Chicken Bacon Ranch. Enjoy the biz for what it is: a buffet of affordable, bizarre pizza slices that actually taste pretty great.   My one complaint is that Ian's doesn't label its pizzas - so I have to try my best to listen while the guy behind the counter rattles the names off like an auctioneer. Invest in some paper and a sharpie, Ian's."}
{"text":"Want unusual pizza? Go to Ian's. Want good pizza? This isn't the spot. Sauce tastes like Ragu and the crust is more bread than pizza crust- probably as good as Dominos or even some frozen pizza brands..."}
{"text":"Great place to go for an A-bar.  Interesting cheap tasty greasy food.  Very fast and it has an atmosphere, simply because they are so popular"}
{"text":"Sober Bobb thinks ordering one piece is sufficient and walks away full and satisfied with a good (but not great) slice of pizza.  Late night Bobb gorges on three pieces and thinks it is out of this world."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I came here because everyone rants and raves about it. I don't think they're nearly as good as Pizza di Roma. They are more convenient though. Ever since Pizza di Roma started carrying the mac'n'cheese pizza I haven't been back."}
{"text":"It's the best pizza I've had in the Midwest. PERIOD! The slices are huge and thin like one's from New York but without all the grease. The crust is thin and light without all the dough. The toppings are creative and fun. I had a slice each of the Philly Cheesesteak, the Gyro and the BBQ steak with fries. All we're tasty. The staff is young and fun. You can buy drinks or there's a water fountain. A great college place to get an amazing slice without all the pretense. Just great pizza at a good price."}
{"text":"Best pizza and best service :)   I graduated from Madison so I am a little biased. On our last trip, my fiance and me tried -Mac and cheese: my personal favoriate! -veggies (mushroom, tomato, etc.): It was ok -Bacon with bbq source -short rib with bbq source -Classic cheese  Everything tastes so good. If you ever come to madison, you must try Ian's!"}
{"text":"This (today) is my first visit to Ian's and at the moment of my first bite of their \"European Style\" slice, I was really surprised, in a very good way!  And this came as a surprise even after unpreparedly hearing one of their \"cooks\" saying \"Yang Rou\" (authentic Mandarin/Chinese, meaning lamb meat) in order to explain to me what it was in the toppings.  What I liked most at Ian's is their crusty and always freshly tasting flavor, even after they reheated the slices.  My friend and I ordered four types in the end, and none of them let us down.  We ordered EU style, BBQ, Mac & Cheese, and one whose name I don't know but that came with a kind of meat similar to Cantonese style BBQ pork.  So have a try sometime and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"They need to bring this to California!!   Visited Madison with the boyfriend this weekend and had a great time -- Ian's would a one of the sober highlights.    I didn't try the mac and cheese slice--def should have, but the steak and fries pizza was AWESOME and the portabella/pepper/spinach was darn good too.  For ~$3.50 per slice of amazing specialty pizza..I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This location is much better than State St. I feel like I'm comparing the Cubs & White Sox's as I write this. But anywhoo, Frances offer drive-by pick up. Yes, you read ...drive-by. It's the good kind. LOL. Only during dinner though. I love large slices. Wish they would lower the price on occasion like by 50cents. But don't forget your punch card. I live closer to State, so alas, I have more to say about the State location in terms of service and 'tude."}
{"text":"COME FOR VEGAN NIGHT!   It happens every Monday and they always have great options for the veg-heads among us. If they don't have one in the case, they will whip one up while you wait. The Frances location has done this for me three separate times and each time asked if there was anything in particular I wanted. My favorite was a recent night when they whipped up a pepperoni and cheese plus an artichoke/olive/roasted red pepper. It doesn't hurt that it's around the corner from Vintage, which has $1 beers on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not hungry enough or perhaps I've had too much to drink but I think Ian's is overrated. While they do have very unique pizzas, I just never got hooked on mac n cheese pizza or any of the other \"special\" flavors. They do have they seasonal flavors which can sometimes be good, but I'll usually take a pass if given the option."}
{"text":"During my weekend visit to Madison I was informed that I must try cheese curds, a Brat, beer, cupcakes from Madison Sweets and Ian's. Throwing caution and my diet to the wind I fit them all in to 3 days.   Ian's was great!! I had the mac and cheese and the steak, french fry and bbq sauce pizza. Both were nothing like I expected but really good. The guy who took our order was nice and they were just about empty so ordering was pretty easy. Overall it was a great experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese pizza is a must.  But any of the other pizzas are just as delicious.  You can't go to Madison and not go to Ian's."}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza is non-pizza. Don't get me wrong... I love it, but it's not really pizza.   Even though it's non-pizza, Ian's rules at the pizza-by-the-slice concept. The slices are big (expensive nowadays, but big), they have crowd control in place (necessary in Madison at 2:30 a.m.) and the employees are really patient when your drunk self can't choose between mac 'n' cheese or chicken quesadilla pizza.  When I am craving their buffalo chicken or that one with olive tapenade as the sauce, I'm glad Mesa Pizza in Minneapolis is around to stand in for Ian's. Problem is that it tastes the same, but it's not the same in my heart..."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza pizza. Recently walked in here pizza by the slice for 3$ what?!! & it was delicious! Came back a second time with my son, who ate his entire Mac and cheese pizza. Impressed me! Love this place. Outdoor seating as well. (Not stroller friendly though)"}
{"text":"Ok this place is awesome really because it is open all the time.  The pizza selection is decent with some specialty pies on display and your standards behind the counter.  The service is quick and the food itself is decent.  The BBQ chicken pizza is ok......could definitely use more chicken but the hot sauce next to the counter is pretty good (franks I think).  I haven't tried the Mac and Cheese, but the pizza is pretty good depending how long they leave it in the oven.  On days they are supper busy, they sometimes take it out too quick and the crust in soggy.  If they leave it in long enough, it starts to taste a little like a NY style pizza.  Overall, great place to go when you have a few too many adult beverages, and the best part is they are open at all times at night.  Service is decent for that time of night and they seem to be pretty accustomed to dealing with the intoxicated people."}
{"text":"I prefer this location than the one on State St. The slices seem hotter, fresher, and greasier (YUM) here. Can't say anything bad about the food at all.   (+) Good, greasy, cheesy goodness"}
{"text":"A perfect slice for $3...it had lasagna noodles on top! I was late arriving into Madison - typical delay on the airline- and it was late and our cab ( bunch of us crammed in a cab since it was late and time to ride share) stopped across the street to drop off someone. i spotted Ian's and asked if I had time to go get a slice. My cabbie said he would drop off another couple & swing back for me. I bolted from my cab, not EVEN getting the cab #, license plate # or driver's name...seriously. I was that hungry. Left my triathlon bag with helmet and my suitcase in the cab.   When I went into Ian's, it was packed. I was greeted by an employee who actually said, \" you can't come in unless you bring college boys with you.\" Cracked me up. Especially since I could be his mother!  Place had lots of energy, everyone eating slices. I loved this place. Ate my slice and right after the last bit of crispy crust was devoured, here comes my cabbie. Amazing. Madison is a pretty cool town!  i did go to the Ian's on State Street as well a couple of days later but I was disappointed in how little cheese was on my slice and it didn't cover much of the crust near the edge - kind of bummed out. I prefer the one on N. Frances Street."}
{"text":"I think I have had some of the world's best pizza - John's Pizzeria in NY, Mozza and Abbott's in LA and I gotta be honest, Ian's doesn't really measure up. That said, I get why this place is so beloved in a college town like Madison: unique flavors, eco-friendly products, late hours, and cheap prices.  The mac 'n cheese slice is good, how can cheese, pasta, and pizza crust be bad?, and I tasted the weekly special - crawfish, spicy sausage, and peppers. It was just okay. Overall, you could come here to try some stomach-churning flavors of pizza like BBQ steak and fries, Chicken burrito, and BBFAT (black beans, feta, avocado, tomato) but if I come back to Ian's, I'll probably stick to the simpler fare."}
{"text":"Place rules. Its got a college atmosphere and some of the most ridiculous, albeit tasty, pizzabominations I've ever been privy to.  Last time I was there, I got some taco thing with black beans, lettuce, sour cream and beef and probably more stuff I'm forgetting. It was stupid good.  I also got a slice of the obligatory mac-and-cheese pizza. It's not bad, but in retrospect, I would have gone with something else; the novelty wears off around bite #3.  One beef I have is that it gets crowded. It's not a terribly huge place to dine in, but Madison is a nice town...just take it on the road, son.  If you're looking for your blasè cheese and pepperoni sleepytime-boring pizza, look elsewhere. Ian's slaps you in the face with outlandish."}
{"text":"if I could sum up my late night eating throughout the latter years of college, it would probably all include memories of Ian's Pizza.   While there's one location on Frances Street, there's another near the capitol, which tends to be a hair less crowded during peak times (game nights and bar time). Everyone raves about the mac and cheese, and frankly, I dig it too. What's not to love? Dreamy, creamy, cheesy mac stuck to a crispy piece of carb! It's what dreams are made of. Other favorite options include buffalo ranch, eggplant parmesan, and taco.   Expect to pay $2.50 for a standard slice and $3.50 for a specialty slice. This shows some major inflation from when they first opened...either that or I'm getting really old and have been away from a daily Ian's craving for too long."}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza is PHENOMENAL!!!  The barbecue chicken bacon ranch pizza is to die for.  They have about 30 options for pizza and we have tried about 10 of these.  The mac & cheese pizza that everyone raves about is really bland, but the buffalo chicken ranch, buffalo chicken, chicken cordon bleu, barbecue steak and french fry pizza are delicious and have plenty of taste.  It is really cheap for what you get.  $3.50 for a slice from a 20\" pie is a great deal.  For around $22-26 you can get a specialty 20\" pizza that will make you forever think of pizza differently.  Ian's turns pizza into edible art.  And the crust is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Ian's is launching Frozen Yogurt!!  My bf and I happened to be at their product launch event and got to sample the tangy, refreshing sweet cream (plain) and salt caramel.  What amazed me was Ian's commitment to use local products (Yogurt from Sugar Valley) and eco-friendly fro-yo cups. I think at least 4 stars should be awarded to their healthy attitude.   The frozen yogurt itself was OK - I would say 3.5 stars. I loved the all natural, really yogurt tangy taste, but the texture felt bit waterly. I'm looking forward in tasting more varieties in the future."}
{"text":"I really love Ian's and went there probably more than I should have this summer! I'm a sucker for their \"smokey the bandit\" flavor, which is bbq chicken with cheese and a hint of ranch dressing. The staff is friendly and helpful. The pizza is very tasty; it's perfect for those nights when you just want a quick snack!"}
{"text":"The prices are out of control. 4 bucks for cheese, 5 for meat. I'd rather just buy a good pizza from a local biz. Not what it used to be , that's for sure. Go to pizza di Roma for pizza that makes sense"}
{"text":"I dream about Ian's pizza sometimes now that 3,000 miles tragically separates me from their $2.75 slices of perfection.  *Sigh.    For those still in Madison, you must try:    BBQ Chicken pineapple Chicken pesto Mac & Cheese Chicken Parm  The best cure for that feeling you get when you just start to realize that last shot of Jose wasn't such a great idea...."}
{"text":"We headed here after the bars on a Friday night.   Really great staff- friendly and welcoming. Being from Chicago, I asked them to give me the best they had. They served me up a piece of their Mac n Cheese pizza.   The crust was delicious. Super thin and crisp- just the way I like it. But macaroni on pizza? I must be getting old. I'd go back, but I'd make sure to order something else. The mac n cheese was just a little too much."}
{"text":"My friend liked her mac and cheese, and my more conventional choices (some sort of feta/tomato/olive and BBQ chicken) were both excellent. Next time, I definitely want to try the penne marinara pizza, aka carbs on carbs, aka surely delicious.  They heat the slices up in a super hot oven individually, so your pizza is guaranteed to be delightfully crispy. I also ordered a salad, which way surpassed my expectations. I was ready for sad, iceberg-lettuce-y, sparse toppings salad, and got reasonably fresh lettuce with a smorgasbord of delicious toppings. And there was a TON of it. Pizza and good salad for under $10. Surely this is what heaven is like.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Maybe I was still dizzy from the foodgasm Tom's Red Pepper gave me last night, but I found myself on University right near Ian's and I decided to stop in for a slice. This time, I stuck with traditional, pizza / sausage and a tomato pesto slice. They were good!!! Dammit! I had to write another review because I dissed this place the last time because of their mac and cheese slice, but I had to be fair and say this is pretty good pizza. Not great, not outstanding, nothing that would make me purposely come here for the pizza, but it was good."}
{"text":"Late night super yummy pizza by the slice. Blue cheese, Hawaiian jalapeño, thin crust not that deep dish back in Chicago. Bravo."}
{"text":"I hate the long lines on busy nights but I LOVE the mac & cheese pizza.  They have such an awesome selection of unique choices.  Definitely a staple of downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Whether I am inebriated or sober, I always am jonesin' for a slice of Ian's creativity. The staff are a bunch of young hippies who keep it real and are really nice (unless they are annoyed by the overwhelming falling-all-over drunk freshmen girls with water bottles full of vodka, but I don't blame them in this case). I often find myself thinking about things that can be added on top a slice of triangular dough and then I find out Ian's has already done it. Be sure to try the mac and cheese if you're a first timer as well as coming prepared to be bombarded by college kids if you are coming in around bar time."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Ian's Pizza. Smokey and the Bandit is my favorite."}
{"text":"Ian's provide two of the things I miss about Madison :  - Chicken Alfredo  - Philly Cheese Steak.  If you are visiting Madison this is one of the places you must visit!"}
{"text":"Great Midwest pizza. Who thinks to put Mac n cheese on pizza??? But it's so good! Definitely recommend if you're ever in Madison."}
{"text":"Ian's pizza is pretty much perfect. The lines can get long sometimes, but the crazy variety of great pizza they offer makes up for it. I've been working my way through all their offerings and have yet to be disappointed. If you don't know where to start, you can't go wrong with the mac & cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Ian's Pizza is one-of-a-kind.  There really is no substitute for Ian's. I have not tried all of the unique varieties Ian's offers, but people who have seem to really like them. This is the only place I know of that has really good vegan cheese pizza.  The price is good at a few dollars for a slice. The 12\" one topping pizza I order there has varied in price. I've been charged between $8.50 (which is a great deal) to $12.50 (which isn't a great deal). On a similar note, they have the 12\" pizza made quickly. It usually takes 15-20 minutes at most.   The locations are convenient, I usually eat at the Frances street location. I've also had Ian's deliver, which is quick too. But either way, there wouldn't be any other place I could order from when I wanted Ian's.   If you live in Madison you may have heard of Ian's. If you've heard of it but never tried it, you should."}
{"text":"I have wanted to stop here for a long time and get the mac-n-cheese pizza. It lived up to the hype and was rich and creamy. The ordering process was easy to maneuver and the pizza came out quickly piping hot. Their salads also looked yummy. Loved that they had a free water section by the doors. I would totally come back!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival in Madison, I had heard about this pizza. A mac n Cheese pizza?! Pizza plus Mac and Cheese??? How does this work, where are the photos? All night i debated, should I order 1 slice and a regular pie, should I just settle for some food a few feet away. Well I ordered it, I did it and when I pulled up the website I noticed that they now have a Ian's in my home state of Colorado!!! When I text a friend there  about it, I am received with a reply of \"are you watching me???\" He had just finished a Ian's Mac and cheese pizza! So I questioned him about this pizza, the main question being does it come with any dipping sauces??  So a hour later I am eating my very own and first Mac N Cheese Pizza. I will say I do like it but I'm not sure that it's too much different than just eating Mac and Cheese you know? With that being said I'd order it again, I still want to try some of the other pies with tomato sauce and I'd love for Ian to create some dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Small, unique place that has outstanding pizza!! I'm pretty picky about pizza quality, and this place rocks!!  Old school good pizza, not the crappy pizza chain stuff. The caesar salad was fabulous!  I will return here in the future."}
{"text":"The plain cheese Ian's slice doesn't just bring back warm memories for alumni, for me it brings back the intoxicating thrill of American freedom of speech and worker solidarity.  During a frigid week of protesting with a couple hundred thousand disenfranchised government workers and our wonderful supporters, our spirits were buoyed by the delivery of hot plain cheese pizza from Ian's, ordered and paid for by union brothers and sisters from all over the nation and even from like-minded freedom protesters in Egypt.  We lost that battle, but Wisconsin teachers still strive to properly educate the working masses even in the face of slashed wages and crippling working conditions; Ian's plain cheese pizza to go is still the best snack to munch on while contemplating the beautiful capital dome from the square."}
{"text":"Very creative and tasty pizza! I tried the mac'n'cheese and the bbq potato pizzas. The fresh, Wisconsin cheese was apparent."}
{"text":"Ian's, you are as good as I remenbered you to be!! Its been 8 years, and your mac n cheese slice is still the best slice ive had!!! Keep it up! More years to come!"}
{"text":"This place rules!  Awesome food, fun atmosphere, great beer selection and amazing attention to details.  I was so impressed by their unwaivering support of the protestors at the capitol.  These are stand-up businessmen who know how to take care of their people."}
{"text":"where else in the world can you get mac n cheese pizza, or steak and fries. every magical time i was able to go here i loved it. the spinach feta pizza is awesome. pretty much anything you see will be good. and it's not just a gimmick! the pizza is genuinely good and I'll eat every last bite of crust.   i hope that one day i can tour around again and come back for more pizza!"}
{"text":"What is not to love about Ian's.  It is my go to place before a Badger game or if I'm doing something on campus.  Mac and Cheese is my go to slice.  But I'm not afraid to try other slices.  Keep up the good work Ian's Pizza!"}
{"text":"The Wisco salad was absolutely delicious but way too small for the price! The salads here used to be larger - I don't know why my salad was so small today, though the price stayed the same. I want to give them three stars but I should be full after spending $8."}
{"text":"WOW really......carbs on carbs on fat on carbs....  if you want super junk pizza and a huge slice within 5 minutes of ordering than this is your place. They have tons of options for you like a pizza with avocados, beef, sour cream....a burrito pizza if you will.  Their Mac & cheese pizza is supposed to be super popular but really Madison, really?"}
{"text":"The best and most interesting pizza in Madison, a city with a lot of good pizza.  The mac and cheese pizza is justly famous, but there's a long list of great pizzas here you'll find nowhere, or at least hardly anywhere, else; plus a great lineup of weekly special slices ranging from kung pao shrimp to chicken pot pie.  Not every experiment works, but most do.  Standout slices here:  the mac and cheese, of course.  The Philly cheese steak.  Chicken cordon bleu.  Anything with the locally-sourced bacon or pancetta.  I'm told that the steak and fries pizza is second in popularity only to the mac and cheese, but even for me french fries on pizza is a bit much.  $3.50 a slice sounds expensive, but these are big slices; two is plenty for lunch."}
{"text":"Shit late night pizza does not command any leeway for just being available. All it is is convenience. If you are drunk student trying to soak up alcohol, you are not on yelp looking at reviews. Period. To get to review: Shitty greasy cheese and ingredients, so so crust. Do not come here for anything but a \"late night feed my drunk wanna get it on with the my date snack\". Bon appetit."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a slice before or after a Badger (insert sport) Game or after sampling the many wares of State Street area bars.  Sometimes the best part of this place is the people watching, as one is guaranteed to see someone drunk do something worth remembering and laughing about later.  As for the pizza, there are plenty of better slices out there, but few for a comparable price. I usually stick with a simple pepperoni and sausage, but the philly steak pizza is pretty good, too. I am not big on the macaroni and cheese pizza, but most people I know love it. I'm a toppings and sauce guy, so it holds no particular power for me. I want to try the brisket and tot pizza, but they have never had it when I was there.  The only reason I don't give the location 5 stars is that the service can be a little uneven. Obviously I am being a bit harsh, because trying to serve a population of drunkards can be challenging at 3am."}
{"text":"What a concept. Any pizza u can imagine. And made for you. This is killer at anytime. The kids love the Mac and cheese pizza. Dude behind be counter is knowledgeable."}
{"text":"mac n cheese pizza is the pizza for you and me.  (channeling my inner Spongebob Square Pants if you catch my drift, if not: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i6RUN9Akuo)  mac n cheese not your thing? (weirdo). go for the chicken fettucine alfredo. it is one mighty fine medley of two oh so delicious things.   feelin even more adventurous, check out a slice of the bbq brisket tater tot pizza. yeah, that just happened.  Ian's certainly gets pretty creative, but I'm still waiting for this to go down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaExAJItfno  one day, one day."}
{"text":"I drove across town on a hot tip from my brother.  He said I had to at least get a slice of mac-n-cheese pizza, but that I should also try others.  On my first trip, I had the mac-n-cheese and the specialty BBQ pulled pork.  Both of these slices were just down right delicious!  The thin crust was crispy and the toppings were abundant.  The second time I went, I had the Chicken cordon blue and a chicken penne pasta... both delightful slices.  When I had to opportunity to go with my brother, he said that he chooses his pizza by picking the most colorful pie.  I found that to be unique and helpful advice.  They have 10oz plastic cups and a water dispenser for free beverage.  They also offer other drinks from the cooler.  I enjoyed seeing the sign that bragged about the biodegradable pizza boxes.  Truly a unique pizza joint."}
{"text":"As soon as I clicked on Ian's, my mouth started to fill up with saliva. It's THAT good. Their mac and cheese slice is uh-maz-ing! But their lasagna slice just might be my favorite. I filled up my frequent buyer card more times than I'd like to admit. Oh, and Ian is just so cute."}
{"text":"Ian's is my favorite pizza place ever.  The environment is always fun (sometimes not so chill but that's to be expected at 2 am on the weekend).  Make sure to try their famous Mac n cheese pizza, as well as their chicken bacon barbecue ranch and the Philly cheesesteak when it rolls around as a special.  They also make awesome ranch, which you should always ask for.  The staff is usually pretty chill, but sometimes a little impatient when dealing with obnoxious drunk people, which is to be expected.  Ian's is good for the family during the day and the best choice you've made with your friends at night."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed in this joint.  After a night of partying, I really wanted some greasy, yet quick snack before heading home.  It took 25 mins for them to serve me 2 slices of pepperoni pizza.  I am typically a patient person, but there were maybe 10 people in the restaurant and because they offered no reason (or apology), I can only assume they were just being lazy.  I'm going to give this place another chance because the pizza was tasty.  But good pizza is easy to come by, it's good service that is a rarity.    As it stands currently, I would recommend Glass Nickel.  The pizza is fantastic and so is the service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I had the Mac n Cheese Pizza and the BBQ Chicken pizza by the the slice. Both were delicious. The friend I was with said it was the best pizza they had ever eaten. I would highly recommend coming here. ImWe got there right before the rush but the workers knew how to handle it. I can't wait to go back."}
