{"text":"Wow!  Terrific food, and wonderful people.  The tastes are without exception excellent.  They catered a wedding that I recently attended and all the guests were blown away by the quality of the offerings.  Don't resist the passion fruit dessert!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite food truck of all time! Tried the Rumbera at the Many Feathers Market and the Pabellon Veggie downtown, and they were both really, really good. They've made me a fan of arepas. :P  

Glad they now have a permanent location; looking forward to trying the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Great food
Friendly people
Wonderful experience.
It is open on Saturday!
The Reina Pepiada or Beauty Queen made with avocado and chicken and the Domino ( black beans and white shredded cheese) its fantastic.
Don't miss the Teque√±os ( cheese sticks wrapped in dough) you can eat them here and take some home. Also yucca wedges are out of this world. This place is a Home run! Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Tried my first arepa from this truck while at the Evergreen brickworks. It was delicious! Very hot and tasty, although a little pricey at $10 (although food trucks usually aren't cheap). To be fair it was a large portion -  very filling!"}
{"text":"Arepa Republic was at Celebration Square recently and  it  has been on my list for a while so I went for some arepa 
There are a lot of arepas that you can choose from but I  recommend you get what is as close to Venezuela as possible 
I have  had arepas before but never had a Venezuelan dish  . A Venezuelan  friend  of mine recommended I  try  the  Pabellon Arepa . I am not a fan of cheese so I got  the Pabellon Arepa without cheese. 

Pabellon is a Venezuelan dish comprised of beans , rice, softly braised beef, and plantains.
Arepa is a  piece of maize flower that  can be used like bread. For me it was  like getting a two in one . 

The Pabellon Arepa  was quite good. The Arepa was soft  but firm enough to hold the pabellon inside and  I liked the smooth maize flavour . The pabellon part of the arepa  had a nice spice to  it that gave the dish some flavour . 

I do feel  for the price  one pays they should at least get a side with the arepa , 

Will I be back? Probably  if myself or my friends are craving an arepa. I saw some other arepas  on the menu and would definitely try them  without cheese"}
{"text":"Just found out they opened a location in my hood (Keele and Lawrence) great arepas with fresh ingredients. Only downside is that they close early - I think around 2PM"}
