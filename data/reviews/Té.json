{"text":"ONE OF THE best places I have been to in Toronto! service is great, portions are great, taste is great. If you are on Ossington then definitely try this place, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"We ordered a plethora of dishes. Overall the flavours are good but not outstanding. Reading reviews prior I already knew what I was getting. None of the dishes are amazing or stand out but nonetheless are still tasty. It's a nice place to try out and there is no wait considering the lineups for other restaurants in this location. 

The service is stand out just like other reviews suggest. I had made a reservation for 6 but ended up being almost an hour late. The server/ bartender was very friendly and attentive. He cleaned our table consistently and made sure our glasses were filled with water. 

I hope this restaurant continues to work on their menu and come up with more interesting dishes.

The 90's/early 00's hiphop/ rap music and Sailormoon playing on the tv is amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing (hidden) back patio, and inspired dishes. The brunch options are unique and delicious."}
{"text":"I randomly popped into Té for some snacks and drinks. I was blown away by their food.

Kimchi Ravioli was my fave, but everything that we tried was a hit - including the devilled eggs, bulgogi beef sliders and Taiwanese Fried Chicken. 

While we sat inside, there is an amazing back patio.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Huevos mash up and waffles and fried chicken were good but nothing special. Nice patio. Was not busy at all on a Sunday at 12pm. 

With so many brunch options it's hard to see me go back to Te but the meal was good."}
{"text":"The drinks are really really good. Everything else is a hard pass. 

Food we ate: 
Kimchi Deviled Eggs - weird and unpleasant combination of flavours. Like made me shudder unpleasant.
Pizza TTeok Bok Ki - okay so the only thing that actually makes this \"pizza\" is that they added cheese to a classic Korean dish. The bok ki itself was overly sweet and too chewy
Toasted Kimchi Ravioli - It just didn't work. The wasabi on top was not a good flavour combination

This \"fusion\" made me feel like if an American and Korean person got stoned and decided to try and mix all their favourite foods together. Great in theory, bad in practice."}
{"text":"Very interesting fusion of korean and western food.
We ordered about 5 dishes (to share between 2) and the best were the bulgogi beef sliders.
The dumplings are just dumplings though. The squid was a bit tough, and I realize it's something hard to get right.
The garlic edamame is also very tasty!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Té and today I came with my husband and 2 kids (2 yr old and 5 month old). Yes we are that couple that inappropriately brings our kids to restaurants that we don't belong in because they're too hipster or upscale, but we desperately needed a date night! We were originally going to Odd Seoul but had to wait a while for a table so we strolled a few doors down to Té. Despite 2 young kids in tow, we were welcomed right in and seated immediately.

Food: awesome, incredibly tasty and well priced. Our favourite was the bulgogi sliders- the meat was flavorful, quail egg was perfectly cooked, the wasabi mayo added a nice kick, and the house made buns were delectable with a hint of sweetness to it. Overall great balance of flavours. The Taiwanese fried chicken was also tasty- great spices, well seasoned and the skin was light and crispy. 

Service: impeccable, and the biggest reason I gave 5 stars. We were lucky to have Steven as our waiter as he welcomed us and our kids with open arms and never made us feel rushed. He was attentive, friendly, and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, always making sure the kids had everything they needed. It wasn't busy tonight (Wednesday evening) so we got to chat a bit with him every time he came around which was really nice. 

Ambience: cool vibe, with a TV playing Sailormoon on one wall and a funky mural on the other wall. Music was great (old school tracks from my high school days!) and at a perfect volume to have a normal conversation. 

Overall had a perfect and wonderful evening at Té and hope to come back soon to try their weekend brunch! Thanks for the great night!"}
{"text":"I hosted my birthday dinner at Té based on my best friend's recommandation. I am so glad I took a chance, they truly went above and beyond to ensure my guests ( 12 people in total) and I had the best experience possible.
Everything was flawless, from booking, Grace helped me to assemble a very reasonably priced  prix fixe menu for the group and made sure to include a sample of everything. 
Our waiter, Stephen, was extremely attentive, courteous, and made good suggestions for cocktails. 
The food was amazing, everyone enjoyed it thoroughly( some of us are really picky eaters)  

I would certainly go back for the tasty food, drinks and service. I am so glad I found this little gem on the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"Te is a cute restaurant, I was just here for dinner.  Food was ok, nothing spectacular, we had the braised beef poutine,  bulgolgi mac n cheese, fried chicken, lettuce wraps, sliders and kim chi deviled eggs, out of those I would recommend the deviled eggs and sliders, service was excellent,  this place opens late so it's a good place to grab some snacks and have drinks"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First for dinner/drinks and then for brunch. The first time I came was pretty soon after they opened so I think they were still figuring things out. The drinks were delicious. The service was friendly but a bit unsure. The second time service was impeccable. 

For dinner I had bulgogi Mac and cheese, it was simple but delicious. My friend had the bi bam bap and said it was delicious and very filling. 

For brunch I had the fried chicken and waffle and my partner had the stuffed pancakes. Both were delicious but the stuff pancakes were really something special. I will be back. This place is all around excellent!"}
{"text":"This is the best casual well priced delicious eats on ossington.. unpretentious and the service is amazing. Must try the unadulterated ssam with bulgogi!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Been here twice now for dinner and had such a great experience.  The servers here are super nice and attentive.  The food is excellent - you can tell the chef really pays attention to detail and wants every dish to be perfect.  I have tried most of the dishes on the menu and the must haves are the bulgogi sliders, pizza tteok, unadulterated ssam - pork belly, fish and taro chips, salmon burger.  Sooo delicious and wants me to keep on coming back for more!"}
{"text":"If you want Asian Fusion, then look no more. This place has it all. Innovative cocktails, appetizers and entrees.  I was told it was a mother and daughter team, who make everything homemade and with the freshest of ingredients. From the sauces, kimchi to the baked desserts.  It was delish. We started with the Chips, Guac and Kimchi Salsa and Squid Chon to our main entrees of Bi Bim Bap and Fish and Taro Chips. Our dessert was the Green Tea Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich.  Everything came to our table hot, tasting fresh, seasoned to perfection and delicious. 

Our server Elena was amazing. Attentive, smiling and just went beyond any service standards.  The atmosphere was calming and clean, especially the washrooms. I hate dirty bathrooms. 

The outside patio is serene with the white lights overhead and the beautiful summer sky.  

Highly recommend to give it a try.  

Reservations are recommended on Friday and weekends as it is a small restaurant.  Reasonably priced for the portions. 

Next to try is the brunch - Stuffed pancakes - Korean Style"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this Asian fusion restaurant on Ossington while looking for brunch options in Toronto. The interior had a very inviting and cosy atmosphere (although a bit small) but that's a non issue because turns out they have a huge patio at the back!

I ordered the dark-spice Taiwanese fried chicken and egg waffle and was honestly looked a little underwhelming when it arrived. However, after drizzling the maple syrup over my chicken/waffles and taking the first bite, I was shocked at how flavourful and perfectly crispy the chicken was. The spices definitely added an unique Asian flavour to my meal! If only the price wasn't as steep ($18+tax), it would definitely be on my weekend brunch rotation."}
{"text":"A sandwich board marked $5 draft brought me inside Te on a Sunday as I had time to pass waiting for a friend. This hole in the ended up being not so much a hole in the wall but a bright space different from the other dimly lit restaurants on Ossington. The Asian-Fusion popularized by other restaurants on the street is done differently at Te being they are spot on with creating a beautiful fusion. Breaded kimchi- ravioli, ummm hi. One of the best dishes I've had in a long while. Their cocktails are all tea infused, is what the owner told me. I ordered the \"Bloody Assam Caesar\" which is made with a black tea infused tequila and topped with red wine. They also have a bubble tea cocktail! 

Also, what I loved most about this place is the fact that they have SAILORMOON playing on the TV's next to the bar area- which I think is just about the coolest thing and kept me entertained. 

TIP: they take reservation for brunch on the weekend!!! 

They now have a large sign out front marking the location of the restaurant- personally I think it's a must on the Ossington strip"}
{"text":"I liked this place! It's a nice change/ mix of vibe from ossington usual spots. Owner was friendly and I love how there's a cozy cushioned bench seating around bay window. Food was very delicious and big portions. Price point was fair for the amount you get. I really liked how they offer both bottomless coffee (brew was great no need for milk/sugar) and French press. Food tastes very fresh and seasoned very nicely. Will return for brunch again!"}
{"text":"The menu was great, had tons of variety, it was actually hard to make decisions!

The food was tasty, my only suggestion is every dish came out warm, not hot, even the plates themselves were cold to the touch.

What made this experience amazing was the service, Steven is probably one of the best servers I've experienced in a really long time. He has very knowledgeable about the beverage and food menu, offering great advice. He was attentive yet discreet and very friendly. Sadly, this type is service is not the norm anymore. 

Fabulous overall!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for brunch and really liked it. I had the Kimchi and Pork Belly Eggs Benedict and it was fantastic. Best part of the dish was the hash browns. I could've had a full plate of just that. My husband had their Taiwanese Chicken and Egg Waffles which was also very tasty. My only criticism would be that while the chicken tasted good and juicy, it wasn't all that much like authentic Taiwanese chicken."}
{"text":"The food was OK.   I had the matcha waffles which was delicious but the eggs and bacon were mediocre.  I prefer my own eggs and bacon I make at home. The service was great and the location was baby friendly which helped with our experience."}
{"text":"Randomly walked into this place when in Ossinton. It's a Korean fusion restaurant. The food is quite good and impressive. Tapas style and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place to hang out with friends.  Food is good.  Didn't try any drinks though.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"5 stars for our bubbly server and the pretty patio in the back. It makes for amazing photos with the lights hanging above us. 

3 stars for the actual taste of the food. We got sweet potato fries and the matcha cream cheese. It tasted decent. Well more like I could have bought it from the frozen section and reheated at home. And the portions were tiny and overpriced. Cheesecake slice was the size of my palm, and I have small asian girl hand/palm. If portion sizes were bigger, I would consider coming back to try the other stuff in the menu."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Saturday. Surprised to see we were the only ones in the restaurant. 

Ordered the kimchi pork belly eggs benny with hash browns and the taiwanese fried chicken with a hong kong waffle - everything was tasty and very reasonably priced. Girlfriend ordered an amaretto milk tea which was also really good. 

We sat out back in the patio. Unique menu if you enjoy asian fusion."}
{"text":"When I looked at the menu, I was overwhelmed (in a good way) with all of the unique fusion food items! There was a gigantic list of various tapa-style dishes -- so that you could order a lot to share with one or more people -- and also a main course list that also contained food items that were just as unique as the tapa ones. I felt like I couldn't choose just a few but instead wanted to order and eat the entire menu! LOL. I was really impressed with the selection and variety (and creativity) of the dishes!

We settled on several tapas to share, one main course, and their unique tea-inspired cocktails of course. The server was extremely accommodating, friendly, attentive, and catered to us the entire night. We felt the warm hospitality and greatly appreciated it!

For my tea-inspired cocktail, I ordered the Mango Black Té which our server commented that it was one of the top picks as it contained the mini tapioca pearls. It also contained scotch whiskey, assam tea, mango syrup, teapot bitters, and dried mango.

It was definitely a unique drink that tasted of alcohol and tea! There was the slight mango taste and I really liked the mini tapioca pearls. They were so tiny but chewy and bouncy. What I appreciated the most about this cocktail was that it wasn't watered down at all and it was rich in flavour -- something that I find a lot of cocktails lack and thus why I don't always order drinks during dinner.

Before long, our food arrived! The first to arrive was the Salsa Set. This had two small bowls of fresh kimchi-spiked tomato salsa and guacamole with tortilla chips. The guacamole was substantial and contained ample mashed avocado in it. The kimchi-spiked tomato salsa was what made the Salsa Set so unique. It was very tasty!

However, there were so many more tasty things to come. The next one was the Kimchi Deviled Eggs. These, in addition to the Salsa Set, were recommended to us. The Kimchi Deviled Eggs were hard-boiled eggs redressed in a kimchi paste, sesame and yolk mash, and topped with finely chopped bacon. Even just reading that description made my foodie senses tingle. I've never heard of deviled eggs served this way! And what do you know, these were delicious! The hard-boiled eggs were done just right; smooth and tender. The kimchi paste wasn't very strong in spiciness and I loved the finely chopped bacon on the top which gave it a very crunchy texture. I loved this tapa!

The Toasted Kimchi Ravioli was a bonus from the kitchen from Grace to us to try. These were panko crusted jumbo ravioli squares filled with a kimchi-spiked ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan blend, and finished with a drizzle of honeyed wasabi pesto sauce. These were very unique and I thought that they tasted more of the ricotta and mozzarella cheese than kimchi. However, reading its description again, it doesn't really say there is kimchi actually inside the ravioli squares. It is simply kimchi-spiked! These were still quite good though. (Eat them while they are hot so it retains its shape before deflating.)

The Braised Pork Crostini was a surprise favourite for the both of us. It contained chopped Taiwanese slow-cooked pork belly on toasted French baguette slices. There were four of these on the platter and it was best to eat it when it was served. The slow-cooked pork belly was so well seasoned and tender that it tasted like eating pate to me at one point -- I loved it. It was perfect and I didn't know that braised pork on crostini would taste so good!

The Bulgogi Sliders came in four as well. These were thin slices of soy-marinated beef sirloin piled high on toasted mini sesame buns, each topped with a runny quail egg and wasabi mayo. These were adorable to eat and served open-faced. This left the preference to put in some spicy Korean sauce if you so desired (as I did later on using sauce from the Pizza Tteokbokki). I actually didn't taste the wasabi mayo in these sliders very much, and I found the sliders a little bland. However, upon adding some sauce to complement the beef, it was quite good!

The Pizza Tteokbokki was served in a black pan and contained soft, Asian-style steamed rice dough balls sauteed with garlic, onion, and bell peppers smothered in a sweet chili tomato sauce and oven-baked with mozzarella. This was incredible and tasted like authentic Korean ttoekbokki! The rice dough balls were perfectly tender and chewy; not hard at all which is difficult to achieve sometimes. The mozzarella was incredibly cheesy and perfect with this Korean style \"pizza\"! (I used the sauce from this pizza on the Bulgogi Sliders and it really enhanced the taste.)

 I absolutely love fried chicken, especially popcorn chicken or Japanese or Taiwanese fried chicken. Thus, when I saw that they had Dark Spiced Taiwanese Chicken, I absolutely had to try it. It comes in a two-piece or four-piece order. For us, since we were trying so many other tapas, the two-piece order was perfect. There was a thigh and a leg part that were served and"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5/5 and not just a 3. The service was great and attentive. The food was good but this restaurant can really benefit from a portion or price adjustment.

We went on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and were the only ones in the restaurant. The service was so friendly we didn't feel uncomfortable being the only ones there but were just curious as to why. Upon reading the reviews after my sentiment is similar, the food is good but does not align to the price point they've set.

I would recommend giving this place a try anyways if you're looking to check out something different from brunch and don't want to deal with line ups."}
{"text":"The place is great and the staff is very friendly. Didn't like the food. The flavours were a bit weird"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!!!!
I can't say enough about the incredible welcome greeting from Stephen!
We came here at a busy time and unlike everywhere else that treated us like \"whatever\", we received a personable request to wait.
We waited and ended up having some amazing food. Definitely recommending the kimchi ravioli, fried chicken and \"Marteni\".
Definitely coming back and bringing my other friends along.

Keep up the amazing service."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Glad I checked this place out!

Came for afternoon drinks and snacks. Impressed with the value and quality of the food. Ordered the taiwanese chicken and unadultered bulgogi ssam. Very authentic taste!

The ambiance was casual and laidback. It's a cute and modern establishment to hang out with your friends or go on a date- bonus if you get the booth right at the front!

Service was good, the server was knowledgeable about the menu and recommended his top picks. Very attentive and came back to check on his frequently to see if we wanted refills."}
{"text":"I have heard of this Asian fusion restaurant on Ossington for a while and decided to check it out last night. It was raining so we didn't get a chance to sit in the patio but the inside was a very comfortable setting for a nice dinner with friends. We ordered about 4 dishes to share among the 3 of us including the bulgogi mac and cheese, the bulgogi sliders, the poutine and the fried chicken. While our server was beyond amazing making sure we were well taken care of, the food was a bit lacking. 

The mac and cheese bulgogi was a little bland and not enough cheese so I felt like I was eating cooked noodles with seasoned beef. We ordered the poutine with a sunny side egg and it was enjoyable, but the fries it self was soggy and I just didn't find it special. The bulgogi sliders were the best part and if I find myself at Te again then I would definitely order it! The fried chicken was fried chicken, nothing special and nothing bad about it. Although I would recommend that they have the egg waffle with it as a side dish for dinner as well, and not just at brunch.

Overall, it's a nice place for some shared plates and drinks with your friends but I wouldn't expect to be completely blown away by the food."}
{"text":"Came to Té for dinner on a Thursday night for two people, and ordered most of the menu, per usual.

For drinks, we started with the Mango Black Té, which was a great alcoholic twist on one of my go-to drinks at bubble shops. We later followed it with the Chai Milk Té, which was also a great alcoholic take on a favourite at HK cafes. While both were good, the tapioca in both seemed to take on a very bitter and alcoholic taste, which might have been as a result of the alcohol settling on the bottom of the glass.

In terms of food, we ordered quite a bit. The braised pork crostini had fantastic flavour and texture, but the crostini was on the soggy side. The squid chon suffered from a similar, soggy disposition, but had fantastic flavour and a generous amount of squid. The pizza tteok bok ki, a favourite of mine and my girlfriend, was very well made and just the right texture and savoury flavours. The bulgogi sliders were tasty, and the bread was nicely toasted, while the bulgogi and cheese played well together. The unadulterated ssam had a fantastic contrast of textures between the lettuce and the pork belly, as well as a great depth in terms of flavour.

Moving onto the fried stuff: the dark spiced Taiwanese fried chicken caught my eye, and it was certainly tasty, but the chicken meat itself could have used more seasoning or marinating, and was also on the expensive side. The toasted kimchi ravioli was an interesting dish, but three ravioli to an order is somewhat disappointing for 10 dollars.

Lastly, we ordered a green tea cheesecake and toast sticks for dessert. It was a decent way to end the meal, but neither really stood out for me as outstanding desserts, and may have been the weakest part of the meal.

Overall, I really liked my meal at Té. The food was tasty, the twists and new takes on traditional dishes were interesting, but I found that the prices and portions were incongruous. For an Ossington joint, their prices aren't ridiculous, but the portions and type of food that is being served at Té is not what I'd expect to be priced as such.

I am aware that they recently lowered their prices, which is a great first step, but I'd be hesitant to spend $8 on two pieces of dark spiced Taiwanese fried chicken. I'd definitely come back to try other drinks and maybe a menu item that I've missed, but I'd love to see Té take a snack bar approach with their pricing, given what they are serving.

Still love the drinks, though."}
{"text":"We came by this place super unexpectedly for dinner, due to the 4 star review on Yelp.

Walking in, it seemed like there was a celebration as there were about 10 people sitting close to the door laughing fairly loudly. No sure if they were actually open or not, we decided to wait a bit, before the host finally came by to ask us how many were in our party. Besides this party of 10, I didn't see anyone else in this restaurant. We sat closer to the back inside the restaurant, and later realized that there was actually a balcony area as well!

We ordered their:
1) Bulgogi Sliders ($13)
This came as a set of 3. The bao are very soft and lightly toasted. The bulgogi beef was delicious - I thought this was one of their best dishes, however I do think that #13 is pretty costly for 3 small sliders.

2) Deep Fried Dumplings ($6)
This was an average plate of fried dumplings. For a total of 6 dumplings, I thought this was VERY overpriced, I can purchase 2 packs of these dumplings from the grocery store and make these myself. The sauce added to the \"asian fusion\", but it wasn't exactly asian fusion in my opinion.

3) Kimchi Ravioli ($9)
There were four pieces of approximately 5cm by 6cm ravioli pieces. These ravioli pieces are gently breaded before being toasted. I thought this was a really interesting asian fusion dish, but the flavours didn't blend so well together for me. 

All in all, Te was an interesting Asian Fusion restaurant, but I wasn't a huge fan of their dishes and in my opinion, it was slightly expensive."}
{"text":"Walked in with a group of six just as they started dinner on a freezing cold night. Nice decor, clean and modern space. 
As we were the first and only group at the moment, we had dedicated service from the waiter. She was great.
We ordered a bunch of dishes to share including crispy squid balls, squid pancakes, jap chae, bi bim bap, braised beef poutine, yam fries, pork belly on lettuce wraps, and bulgogi with mac n cheese.
Everything was really good, but...ahhmmmm...bulgogi with mac n cheese???? Where have you been all my life?!?! It was amazing. The mac n cheese was done perfectly, as far as I'm concerned. The slightly sweet flavour of the bulgogi is the perfect compliment to this dish. 
All in all, we found the food to be very tasty and nicely presented. Good value for the prices as well. Nice addition to the Ossington foodie strip."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends for their brunch.  On the menu, they had a variety of fusion dishes that my friends and I ordered. None of us order their cocktails for brunch but they do serve some unique ones. I choose the bulgogi burger which was served in an egg and a choice of mixed greens or fries as a side. I definitely liked it although when I bit into the burger, I took a lot of the beef.

My friends enjoyed their dishes to which included waffles and egg benedict with an Asian twist. We were originally tempted to order the poutine but held back just in case we were full from our orders. It is a new brunch choice for me in the future. They have lots of tables to fit the rush and best of all, the service was amazing. We spent about 2 hours for brunch with great conversation."}
{"text":"This restaurant truly surprised my wife and I. We ate on the beautiful patio on a beautiful day. The service was to be recognized - he was really professional and great at making recommendations. We had the fried chicken, Toasted Kimchi Ravioli with Honeyed Wasabi Pesto, Bulgogi Mac n' Cheese and the Jap Chae with a glass of the Mar-Té-Ni and Prince Edward County Chard (I can't recall the winery). Everything was amazingly tasteful with the highlights being the Jap Chae, a noodle dish with vermicelli sweet potato clear noodles, bulgogi beef with fresh veggies, and the kimchi ravioli which were a taste explosion and quite original with the fried fresh ravioli that they make in-house and kimchi and cheese toped with wasabi pesto (do I need to say more? yummy...). The mac and cheese was also quite special with the bulgogi and crusted cheese and would order it again. The fried chicken very good but Kai Pai in Cabbagetown has this place beat for their taiwanese style chicken (but that place is hard to beat).

Although we stumbled on this place after not getting a table at our originally selected restaurant down the street, we are very satisfied of our choice and we will return. The sliders looked to be a hit with our nearby tables."}
{"text":"Everything about Te's Instagram page made me want to visit this relatively new resto - Lovely decor, beautiful plates, REALLY interesting food combinations. Sadly, the food was a complete letdown. The menu sounds fantastic (Korean Fusion) but the flavours are not combined properly and the result was disappointing. 

We had:

Deep Fried Beef Dumplings: Not bad. They taste frozen, but the dipping sauce helps elevate the dish. 

Kimchi Devilled Eggs: An unpleasant combination of two of my favourites. The flavours just did not work - mild gag reflex ensued. 

Marbled Egg Shooter: Again, not bad. But they should tell you that one order is 4 portions - we ordered too much and tried to give our extras to the next table. They were just as unhappy about the food as us and politely declined. 

Pizza Tteok Bok Ki: Why did we even THINK this was going to be good?!?! Its an overly sweet version of a traditional Tteok Bik Ki with shredded and melted mozzarella on top. 

Toasted Kimchi Ravioli: What should have been the best item on the menu ended with sadness. The fried ravioli skins were great, but the filling was off-putting and the wasabi pesto overpowered the entire dish and did not work at all.  

If you do decide to come to Te, please try other items on the menu. Eat what we had and you will walk away unhappy, with a sore stomach and filled with sadness. And try the drinks - they were good. Bourbon Sweet Te was pleasant and soothing, Mango Black Te was refreshing and fun, Jasmine Gin & Tonic was a fun twist on a classic."}
{"text":"We arrived at this place because our first choice had a long line - which is how I suspect they get much of their business. The restaurant was less than half full, but we somehow still had to wait close to an hour for our food, which was underwhelming when it finally arrived. The staff was very friendly, and did their best to accommodate us.  Unless you're grabbing a drink or aren't in a rush, I wouldn't waste your time."}
{"text":"My goodness is this place amazing!  Went here on a whim and was so pleasantly surprised.  The bartender/server Steven was amazing! He made exceptionally recommendations based on our own personalized palettes.  He was exceptionally knowledgeable about the menu and the cocktail list. 

Our Evening dishes and drinks consisted of: 

Starters:
Bulgogi Sliders (I could eat a million of these)
Deep Fried Beef Dumplings 

Mains:
Bulgogi Mac & Cheese
Tonkatsu

Drinks 
The Mar*té*ni
Mango Black Té
Té Bubbly (one of the best tasting drinks I've ever had!!) 

The dishes were flavourful and unique.  The price was right and the portions were exceptional! 

If you weren't too hungry and you wanted a sensory experience - order the Bulgogi Sliders with the Te Bubbly.  You will not be disappointed! 

I am already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Randomly came across this place while looking for a place to eat. It was busy but they found a spot without reservations for three of us. 

The food and the service were great! Our server, Steven, was very professional and friendly. He apologized for slow service although we didn't think it was slow at all.

Everything was delicious and easy to share. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Nice cosy spot for lunch. 

We went on Saturday for lunch.   The weather wasn't particularly pleasant so it wasn't very busy.   Ordered the dark spiced chicken and HK egg waffle, and the brown sugar stuffed pancakes.   

I loved my dark spiced chicken...well spiced, juicy....just YUM!   The egg waffle was very crispy, and I wished it had a bit more chew.   

The brown sugar pancakes were pretty good too...3 to a plate, but it had a LOT of brown sugar filling.   Let's just say that my head was ringing afterwards and it's a decent dish shared but not on it's own.   

Looking forward to trying the other brunch items as well.....   great for the area!"}
{"text":"Ok listen, I know this place has 4 stars but I don't really think it deserves it.

I ordered the Tonkatsu, and while it was fine -- I've definitely experienced better Tonkatsu (for cheaper) in Koreatown. The portion was kinda small imo which is satisfactory if you're not too hungry, but I hadn't eaten all day so I felt like my dinner wasn't filling enough. 

I realize that the location and the restaurant's decor is likely why the prices are a bit inflated in comparison to any other Asian restaurant; so maybe come here if you're trying to impress someone. 

I probably won't be coming back as I felt like the food here isn't necessarily comparable to an authentic Japanese/Korean/Asian restaurant (I know this is supposed to be a fusion joint but still...); and the prices weren't worth it for the portion sizes that they offer."}
{"text":"Let's get right to it - the food here is awesome. But I'm worried for this place - there are some solid adjustments that need to be made if Te is to survive. I'm giving it 4 stars just based on food - that is a statement, for sure! 

Good stuff first: The Dark-Spiced Taiwanese Fried Chicken is soooo sooo sooo sooo soooo sooo soooo sooo sooooooooo GOOD. It's incredible, spicy and sweet and juicy and luscious all at the same time. I'm in love with it, I would marry it and I would eat it every day. I like how they are using it too - you can get it on the dinner menu, the late night menu, or the brunch menu. I had it for brunch, with a Hong Kong-style egg waffle and an overflowing shot glass of real maple syrup. This dish was HEAVEN. I'm gushing, I can't stop gushing about it. Soooo GOOD!!! My love had the Huevos Mash-up, which he also really enjoyed. No question here - the food is great. If I ever get past the Chicken and Waffles, I can't wait to try the Pork Belly and Kimchi Eggs Benny. Gimme. Coffee and mimosa were both very good, and I love the presentation - they have great dishware and glassware here. All lovely.

That said, there is some major awkwardness going at this place, and it needs to be addressed. On the day we visited, it was Father's Day. At Union next door, there was a line out the door of people waiting to get in for brunch, people sitting on the sidewalk waiting. A place with as interesting a menu as Te should be able to siphon off some of those diners, but Te was completely empty at prime brunching hour. Here's my thoughts on why:

Neighborhood - Ossington is all about that urban upscale hipster yet gritty thing. The Ossington crowd wants quality, but they want it to feel a little more underground or raw or \"authentic\", whatever that means. I'll be blunt - Te doesn't seem to fit on Ossington. It feels trendy, more like a Yonge and Dundas fancy bubble tea bar. It has that very antiseptic, vaguely plastic, hyper Asian feel to it. Don't get me wrong - it's a beautiful space, great lighting and all that - it's just not Ossington. If this place were located near Yonge and Dundas, I think it would be packed. Although, maybe not, because...

Price - The prices are kind of high. My Taiwanese Chicken and egg waffle was $19, the Huevos Mash-up was $18. For a brand new place without a name chef or provenance to lean on, these prices are a bit of a speed bump. Next door, Union's brunch dishes average $16, and they are a well-reviewed, established restaurant, with a very experienced, well known, chef owner. But you aren't going to lure in customers off the street with those prices.

Name - The name may be cute and modern or whatever, but it's just not meaningful or memorable. You can't even search it on Yelp, Yelp says, you searched for \"Tea\"? This is not a positive. 

Atmosphere - As I mentioned, the place was empty when we walked in. Not good. And the music.. well, something has to change with the music. It was wayyyy tooo looouuuddd, and just kind of obnoxious. It seemed to be on an iPod or something, but with no modulation? So one song would be ok volume, and the next would be booming, way too loud. It was like europop mixtape gone wrong, definitely not the music you want for brunch. Just wrong. 

My advice to Te is this: Grit it up a little. Get some interesting art or paint a giant mural or something to create some visual interest - the clean Asian thing is good, but it's not interesting or unique or exciting. Please god, change the music, now!! Both of those things will give Te a better personality. And lower your prices for now, just until you get established. Because I want you to last, and I want to eat wayyy more of that Taiwanese Fried Chicken. I loved meeting you guys, the service was so enthusiastic and fun! Be smart about your business and make it fit the neighborhood. I'll be in to try the dinner menu soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for brunch but the restaurant was not very busy, which I enjoyed! The service was attentive and we received great recommendations from the waitress. Among all the delicious items I liked their sweet potato fries with the wasabi mayo the most. The fries were very crispy and the wasabi mayo was a perfect match! It is not always easy to \"fusion\" the food but Te makes grease fusion creation and is able to incorporate Asian twist into a western style brunch. I will definitely come back for dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"Strategically picked this new-ish resto to try because of it's close proximity to bang bang to get dessert after. Was not disappointed. At first, we were a little bit worried because when we walked in about 7pm on a saturday night - the place was empty. But that just meant that the service was so much more attentive. We were sat at the only round booth by the front window  with a TV perfectly situated for us to catch the raptors and leafs playoff games. The decor is really chic and cozy. Great place for a date or like us - dinner with friends. The 3 of us started w/ drinks - sangria, black mango te and some black chai te aka bbt with alcohol in it. All the drinks tasted great. Ive never had bbt with alcohol in it before so that was neat. We also had the jasmine tea gin and tonic and that went down really well. Really smooth. It was like we were at a pho restaurant sipping on jasmine tea w/ a kick! 

We ordered a number of things on the menu to share. Fried chicken x4 pieces, bulgogi mac and cheese, unadultered pork belly ssam, kim chi ravioli, bulgogi sliders, and tonkatsu. Out of everything we had, the best were the ssam, fried chicken, and sliders. I'd say I was the least impressed by the kim chi ravioli - the kim chi and the wasabi/pesto had disagreeing flavours IMO. Tonkatsu was average. The bulgogi mac and cheese was a bit plain - it was just mac and cheese w/ bulgogi on top - not enough fusion flare in that dish - needed some kimchi in it or something. We had added siracha to everything as well - wasnt as spicy as we had thought. Fried chicken was moist, not overly salty. Overall, good food, good drinks. The 3 of us split the bill and paid about $60 per person after taxes and tip. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Te is a gem. A real gem. Unique and amazing food, great staff and atmosphere, you can't go wrong! It was a bustling Friday night and we decided to go here for dinner because I've been eyeing this place for a while. We (my mom and I) had the Jap Chae, Taiwanese Fried Chicken, Bulgogi Mac and Cheese, and the beef dumplings for the main meal. All were fresh and very delicious! For dessert, we had the Green Tea cookie ice cream sandwich and the butterscotch cheesecake slice and were both amazing as well. I hope more people will check out this place, it deserves recognition :)"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday around 2:30pm and ordered off the brunch menu. We ordered the dark spiced Taiwanese fried chicken and egg waffle and the green tea egg waffle. The fried chicken was pretty good and tasted like popcorn chicken you order at Destiny's or other bubble tea joints. The egg waffle didn't have much egg-y flavor. 

I was very disappointed with the green tea egg waffle. It had a light flavor of matcha but that was very overpowered with the honey that was drizzled all over the waffle. It made it way too sweet and I only had a couple bites before I gave up on it. It also came with 2 tiny breakfast sausages and over easy eggs. Definitely not worth $14...maybe $7-8 max. 

Really nice servers and pretty decor but wouldn't come back!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that in terms of the physical layout, location and waiter service I was more then pleased with those aspects when it came to Té. However (and it's the most important in my books!), I honestly think the price you pay for the portion sizes one receives is beyond ridiculously small and overpriced for this restaurant. I ended up ordering the poutine dish on the menu, and for what $10 bought me I have to say it was the smallest and least tastiest poutine I have ever eaten. That was a big disappoint in my opinion because it's not a hard dish to screw up in reality. My suggestions are either drop the dish or start making your portions larger in all seriousness. There were other food items my other friends ordered and we all agreed there were some items lacking (like why wouldn't you naturally serve a side with fried chicken?). 

I personally would never come back here as I feel like my money can be well better spent somewhere else..."}
{"text":"The girls and I came here for brunch during our weekend getaway. I was panicking, trying to find a place that would let me make reservations online for 5 with less than 12 hours' notice. I stumbled upon this place, and after reading over the menu, booked it. We showed up and were sat in the front circle booth by the window. The table made us feel like we were in our own private section, with a huge window for breeze right behind us. The service was good, and the food was decent. I had their chicken and waffles. The breading on the chicken was pretty hard, and the chicken itself slightly dry. However, I killed the waffle and immediately wanted more, so I stole some of my friend's matcha bubble waffle. They had innovative cocktails compared to what I see in Detroit... They had bubbles in some of them! Great atmosphere, but I don't know if I'd rush to come back with so many other restaurants around."}
{"text":"Wow, I applaud Té for providing 5 star class service.  I believe our server was named Stephen. He was literally a one-man team and was able to serve all the tables by himself without any other assistance and still provided all-star service. Kudos to him. For example, we sat in the backyard patio area and it was nicely shaded. Leaves were falling into our water but Stephen quickly came by to replace our water and apologized for the leaves. If you wanna be treated like a king, come to Té.

On to the food, this is a Korean fusion place and many items on the menu incorporated kimchi. We ordered: toasted kimchi ravoli, bibimbap, tonkatsu, and a dish that deals with falafel and kimchi (i forgot the name of this). The dishes that had kimchi in it were definitely interesting and I liked how it was homemade. However, the bibimbap and tonkatsu were pretty much standard dishes and they were nothing special (probably wouldn't order this again if we were to come back). The portions were generally pretty big for the main entrees and we were totally stuffed.

This place definitely has some interesting brunch items so maybe I will come back for brunch."}
{"text":"WILL VISIT AGAIN!

I thoroughly enjoyed dinner with hubby at this friendly, creative establishment. Both servers were so polite and professional, and their cocktails were all so unique.

I had the English breakfast cocktail and it was fragrant and perfectly mixed- I could taste all ingredients in the drink- see picture of what they serve. If I weren't a lightweight I would have ordered a few more- they looked so interesting.

We also ordered the bulgogi Mac n cheese, Tonkatsu (which came with half a kimchi deviled egg), squid pancakes and their famous bulgogi sliders.

The bulgogi sliders were heavenly. They apparently bake their own buns and the sliders  are topped with fried quail eggs and wasabi mayo. We will go back to try their brunch menu!!"}
{"text":"I am impressed.  Creativity overflows at this place and spills out as a burst of flavour accompanied by top notch service.  Visited on the last night of summer 2017 and though a quiet night neither the chef nor our host skimped in showing us the true colours of this place.  Great cocktails + great food +   Great service can only result in a fantastic time.  Can't wait to return for brunch!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place randomly for dinner, it was a modern, hip asian fusion restaurant with loud music / atmosphere that serves alcohols and a ton of tapas that you can share with your homies. The service was pretty good, food came out really fast and our server was very patient in explaining their most popular dishes and what the restaurant was all about. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I would come back!

We had the bulgogi sliders, deep fried dumplings and the toasted kimchi ravioli. The bulgogi sliders and kimchi ravioli were pretty good! Their whole menu has some really cool asian fusion items!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and was surprised the restaurant was completely empty while all the other restaurants on Ossington was busy. 

We sat down, ordered a cocktail each and a bunch of items on the menu. Everything on the menu was snack size portions. The highlight of the night was the fried chicken, it was delicious. From the crispy fried skin to the perfectly marinated tender meat that just makes you want to savour every bite, I give it 10/10.  We also ordered the bugogi saam lettuce wrap, Fried ravioli, pork belly crostini and the salsa trio. It was all good but not worth paying $10 - $14 for 3 small pieces on each dish. Lastly, the octopus chon (which is pretty much a pancake) was awfully mushy so we didn't enjoy it at all. 

Our bill came up to $107 with taxes excluding tips which we thought was quite expensive for the amount of food we got. I don't think they need to lower the price but instead, change the perception of value for your money simply by adding one extra piece to their dishes."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp!  Welcome to TE it's a very cute Asian inspired place.  We are sitting here on  a Sunday night and the place was empty.  My friend Jomi was hesitant since there was no people seated down but since a homeless man was haggling us outside we decided to make the leap literally and figuratively, and stepped inside. The place is clean and very new, playing some chill R&B vibes.  We are sitting at a marble candle lit table which looks beautiful,  as some old school sailor moon is in the background.  Our first order of the salsa set is Super fresh and the salsa is of interesting flavor of kimchi but in literal salsa form, a refreshing texture. These avocados are so ripe and were born for this guacamole . we got the fried chicken which was good but I felt like the oil was a little too hot as the outside was on the crispier side, and the spices tasted burned however the chicken was juicy. If this is what they were trying to achieve than great! I didn't mind but my friends thought otherwise. The sliders I'd give a 4/5 the egg on top were nice  runny but I wouldn't come running back for the sliders. As for the Mac and cheese very nice the beef was cooked perfectly with good flavour and nice crisp parmesan cheese Crips on top. We got the matcha white chocolate cookie ice cream, was nice however I would suggest a soft cookie as opposed to a hard crispy one to go with the ice cream for better texture. Overall good is above average, I would not come running back for the food but I would go here if I didn't know where else to go but would like a neat, hip Asian place to visit with amazing service. Tip:*Check out the washrooms the lights serve perfect for taking selfies"}
{"text":"First time going there. Tried kimchi deviled eggs (I think) and ended up ordering a second serving, they were so good. The ravioli was INSANE. I can eat that all day. I'm not a meat eater so my review is obviously limited, but my fiance enjoyed her bibimbab (not sure if that's how you spell it) mac and cheese. We also ordered the soy beans, which were great. Great beer on tap. Really, no complaints. Service was amazing, each dish was explained, great recommendations made by our server. Honestly nothing negative to say, can't wait to go back. Shame I'm never really in that area."}
{"text":"I usually don't really like asian fusion but this was good. Like a few other reviewers we first went to OddSeoul to find it full then my friend suggested Te since they've been before. We accidentally went into Union by mistake next door which was super busy and full. When we went into Te it was quite empty which was weird since it was a Saturday night. 

We decided to sit down anyways and it was a good call. We got the falafels, dark spiced chicken, sliders and the bulgogi mac and cheese + cocktails. 

Everything was delicious and the waitress was super nice. Near the end of the meal the restaurant was filling up a bit more. This place is underrated though!"}
{"text":"Upfront I have to say, Bellwoods and a few other spots on the block were packed, and there were scant few people at Te, and I can't understand that because Te is exceptional, maybe the gem of the block. On all fronts, food, drink, and atmosphere, they hit it on the head. They offer unique amd fun twists on Korean cuisine. We shared kimchi ravioli for eats, which is such a great idea I can't believe more places don't do it. They were fresh amd delicious. The drinks were phenomenol, too. We tried a sangria, fruity but strong, plus one of the special cocktails, a jasmine gin tonic. The latter is as simple as it sounds, a gin amd tonic with a special twist. The jasmine tea flavor is prominent but not overpowering. Very well mixed. The bartender, who was incredibly kind and helpful, told us he is experimenting with more creative mixes as well. Can't wait. For atmosphere, it is bright but classy and very clean, with nice wood finishings and a sweet deep greenish blue wall that features incredible artwork. Above the bar, they were showing some classic sailor moon. If outdoor is where you stay, they have a nice and relaxing patio out back, as well."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out with a friend for the first time. When I walked in, the decor was really nice. I went for brunch around 1pm so the place was not busy.

The menu had some really interesting items, I think I want to come back and try the dinner menu next time. But I tried their chicken and egg waffles, and their kimchi and pork eggs benedict. Both were incredibly delicious! I loved the egg waffles and chicken more.

Great service, great food. Prices are reasonable! Would definitely recommend for those who wants to try out some Korean fusion. They got a lot of kimchi items for their dishes."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in ossington which serves Asian fusion food.  Food was okay nothing too special.  Service is nice but a little slow."}
{"text":"Taiwanese chicken & (bubble) waffles ? Kimchi ravioli ? Pork belly egg benny? This is the place to be for a brunch with a MAJOR Asian flare.

Taiwanese chicken & waffles (5/5)- the juicy chicken pieces were huge and seasoned with an Asian blend of spices really well ! The outside was crunchy, the bubble waffle was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and dipping it all with maple syrup was just perfection. I must say $19 for this dish is pricey though. 

Kimchi Pork Belly Eggs Benedict (4.5/5): the eggs were done just right and leaked yolk as soon as you cut into it..coating the flavourful pork belly pieces, kimchi and English muffin. There were 2 big pieces of pork for each egg benny, definitely a leaner cut of meat though and was chewy & wasn't fatty at all. I had it with a side of salad instead with Asian sesame dressing. Overall the flavours together was super unique & worked well together."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on Saturday during brunch, so a friend and I decided to have brunch before we head over to Bang Bang for ice cream. The decor inside was nice and minimalistic-like the average store on ossington. 

So let's talk about drinks. My friend had gotten the Té green gea mojito (or something like that), and I got the Chai milk Té drinks. The mojito was not enjoyable to her. I did not like my chai tea, it was very bitter and had very subtle hints of chai-which I would have liked more of. 

Food was good. We had the dark spice Taiwanese chicken. The meat was seasoned well, though it seems a tad more pricy than what I would normally pay for the meal. 

Our brunch bill came to about $25 each (prior tax) so it is quite pricy for what we got. Overall it is not a place I'll go out of my way to go to but if I'm in the area I may drop by."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the staff, and obviously the food. It was quiet for a Thursday evening, but either way, the staff felt like my group of friends and I met new friends! They gave amazing recommendations, got to share their spotify playlist with us, and shared some laughs with one another!

As for the food, it was genuinely amazing. Don't quite remember what everyone had, but the quality just hit the spot 

Té is honestly a place to keep a watch out for if you're near Trinity Bellwoods!"}
