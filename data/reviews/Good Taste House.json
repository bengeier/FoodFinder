{"text":"Great food I stopped there one night after work and the food was great .sesame. Chicken . Bowel"}
{"text":"The Worst!!!! I tried to give GTH a second chance but they did not deliver. My first experience was very poor. We ordered food online and waited. It never came. I called to inquire and they said it was out for delivery. 20 mins later, no food. I called again to be told that my food order had never been received. Wow! We waited 1.5 hours for food that never came.  We tried to order by phone last night and they took my order, charged my card and said it would be an hour till delivery. An hour later, we had no food, not again!! I called and was told that it hadn't even been made yet! I am officially over this place. I called to cancel the order and was told I'd get a refund. 24hrs later and no refund. I had to call to remind them. I'm surprised this place is still open with business practices like this. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered food at 2am and i bought just one plate and the lady made me spend $15 so they could deliver, so i did and when the chinese guy got to my apartment he was peeeking inside , that MOFO was looking at my girlfriend asleep which she just had her bra on and then i gave him tip and i guess he wanted more and i said thats all i got since i already bought $15 on food and the guy got pissed and was cursing to himself. But the food was good tho."}
{"text":"I have ordered here many times. It is my family's go to for Chinese food. It is just a tiny little Chinese restaraunt (to go and delivery only) but there food is incredible and inexpensive. Don't judge a book by its cover because its just a small stand alone little place but I have had nothing but excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"I think we all know that dives are where it's at.  This place looks like somewhere I would never go.. but it was awesome.  The food was fantastic.  I had Mongolian beef and Kung Pao. We have now gone twice and haven't been disappointed yet.  Be aware..  you need to order in advance and come and get it.. just do it.  See other bad reviews to understand.. but the food is really good."}
{"text":"The food and service is Excellent here plus the owners are very friendly. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their is a man in this establishment that is yelling at employees calling them stupid telling them to open their eyes very disrespectful in front of customers ordering food I left and didn't even order my food"}
{"text":"This is my first review. I ordered the beef brocoli and it was gross weird taste and the meat was so rubbery I could not eat it. I did not go back to complain..had a bad feeling went I went there the place is kind of thrashy and does  not seem very clean...my fault I should have left. Yes prices seem good but the quality is horrible, save your time and money. I just trashed it."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to taste the food. I ordered delivery.  Two hours later, some guy calls me to say they don't have part of what I ordered.  As if that wasn't frustrating enough he proceeds to try to have small talk with me, asking where I'm from. Really? After I tell him I would like to cancel the order, he changes his tone to rude. He proceeds to tell me getting a refund is my problem and his company doesn't get paid at all for delivery orders because they use a third party. really? Never, never, ever ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Always friendly service. Great food. No complaints, delivery available, and they are open late !!"}
{"text":"Always order for pick up not delivery..place is a true Chinese take out place..the 7th street corridor had a great hidden gem"}
{"text":"The food is very good. I have no complaints with their food at all. The issue is their service. Horrible service. It literally took 2 hours to arrive. No apology. When asked why it took so long, they replied \"were busy\" in a rude tone. I would give this 1 star if the food wasn't really good"}
{"text":"I'd comment on the food but unfortunately I never got the chance to try it. Two hours after placing my order and one call saying the delivery driver was 10 minutes away, I finally call again to find out they were out of pot stickers and hadn't even left yet. They said they called multiple times, which I never got any of their calls. I canceled the order after a total of two hours and 10 minutes for waiting. Terrible service and no compensation for their error."}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24, after an hour and 10 minutes, received a phone call from the restaurant verifying my address. The lady argued with me about my own address.   Save your money and frustration, order from another restaurant!"}
{"text":"Checked yelp tonight for Chinese delivery and ended up choosing this place. Delivery was exactly as described time wise, and the food was incredible. Great portions for a good price, and nothing sketchy! Will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I picked up some teriyaki chicken (or what i thought was teriyaki chicken), got home, popped open the lid and found a HUGE bee or fly right on top of the chicken!!!!!  I will never ever go back to this dirty disgusting place! I can't believe a place like this is even allowed to be in business!! After reading the reviews and viewing the pics, i see I'm not the only person that has has bugs in the food they ordered. To make it all the worst the man and woman running the place, don't speak or understand english and are very very rude! Save yourself this disgusting headache and don't ever consider this place! Yelp is asking me to rate this restaurant with a star, but this place deserves no star, but a big thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Crazy fast, delicious, came up to the window of my car and made me cry.  Good overall"}
{"text":"Called in for take-out.  It took almost an hour.  It was not fun waiting outside on the cheap plastic office/lawn furniture with bugs flying around for over half an hour.  Thank goodness it wasn't toooooo too hot.  The manager (proprietress?) apologized and was very frazzled (one of her employees/drivers called in sick).  She did throw in a free large order of fried spring rolls.  Won ton were fine.  A little bland, but a good size.  Shrimp fried rice was \"dee-ryyyyyyy\" and while I appreciated that it wasn't drenched in oil like Silver Dragon's, it had barely any moisture left in it to make it edible.  The shrimp were overcooked, but thankfully didn't have that chlorine taste.  No bugs in the food, but there was a tiny ant in the takeout bag.  I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordering here has been one of my worst experiences with food delivery. I ordered through the eat 24 app, my order was confirmed, as was the delivery time of one hour. After an hour and a half I called the restaurant to make sure my order was on its way, the woman I talked to said that it's coming but the driver's car broke down so it was delayed. Not 2 min later I get a call from the driver  giving me a completely different excuse, saying she was sorry for the delay but she read my address wrong and ended up in the wrong part of town but now she was headed in the right direction and would be here in 20 min. Nothing was mentioned about her car breaking down. Logic suggests one (or both) of them lied to me about the reason for the delay. And by the time she showed up it had been 2 hours since the order was placed. I wish I would've read reviews before ordering since so many others have had similar problems with delivery. Unfortunately, the food was below average as well. It was edible but I wouldn't order it again even if I expected better service. So disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously overpriced. They took almost two hours to deliver and their portions are really small compared to other Chinese food places in the area. I feel really ripped off."}
{"text":"Got their egg rolls and orange chicken. Food was completely tasteless. Only reason they got two stars is because I really like their lady driver! Added a third star cause I like supporting small local family business. If I give them a second chance will probably order something else. Steamed rice was the best part of my meal :o"}
{"text":"First thing I want to say is that Grubhub says this place is open until 2 am (at least on Thursday nights), so I don't know who is right- Grubhub or Yelp. I ordered at about 9 pm last night.  This is a first impression review. Since they are open so much later than any other restaurant that delivers, I'm sure I will be ordering again and will update my review accordingly.  My friend and I both got the teriyaki dinner specials (teriyaki chicken, fried rice, a spring roll and 2 crab puffs). We also got a bag of extra egg rolls that we didn't order- the charge hasn't gone through yet on my card, but we will see if I got charged or not (I no longer have the receipt except for the one on Grubhub's website).  It was a lot of food, I'll tell you that much. I was really enjoying it until I tasted a rock hard, crunchy *something* in my chicken. I had to spit out the whole bite because I couldn't pick out all the hard *whatever it was*. After that I lost my appetite for the chicken. The rice was pretty good, not anything to write home about, but there was a LOT of it (3-4 cups probably) and I ate most of it, so that says something. My friend commented on how much food there was, and didn't finish his chicken either, but he didn't have any complaints. I think he was just full.  The egg rolls were amazing, and so were the crab puffs. In fact, my friend and I regretted not just ordering a meal of just those (kidding, kind of). Delivery was about 20 minutes, the sodas were cold and the meals were pretty warm.  The teriyaki chicken that I couldn't stomach is still in my fridge. Time will tell if I decide to give it another shot or if I toss it. Hard mystery pieces in my food, yuck! I'll definitely get the crab puffs and egg rolls again, but I'll probably pass on the teriyaki."}
{"text":"We really tried to like this place. Tried it 3 times. This last time sealed their fate- never again. Pros is real white meat chicken, and the veggie rolls are good. Everything else has been disappointing. Tried the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and the won ton soup. The sauces are off, the veggies never taste fresh, and it all has a weird after taste (maybe the oil used?) For the long wait times and price, not worth it. I really wanted to like it, though."}
{"text":"The food is really good! The staff are friendly enough. But they seem to have delivery troubles quite often. There have been a couple of occasions where my order took 3+ hours to reach me, and one of those times, I only got half of my food (The restaurant deflected blame on their delivery service, but after about 10 minutes of arguing on the phone about a refund, they begrudgingly gave me a 75% refund). This place would be 5 stars for me if not for the terrible delivery. If I were to base my rating on everything but the food, it would be 1 star. The food is just that good (I especially like the Mayonnaise Chicken and Curry Chicken Fried Rice). I simply no longer order delivery, only pick-up/take-out; Problem solved."}
{"text":"We live a block from Good Taste House and have become regulars.  The food has never been bad and we actually have started to like it more and more.  For the price, you cannot beat it.  I can understand some of the negative reviews.  The exterior is lacking and never a place you'd want to take a family to eat out.  The customer service can be hit or miss (they have been getting better) and if you happen to call in an order when they have 3 or 4 orders ahead of yours then you will be waiting for a while, like an hour while.  You have to remember they have a tiny kitchen and cook everything fresh so they can only do so much at once.  With all that said, the food is great.  So if you manage your expectations accordingly and don't judge by appearances, Good Taste House is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered from this place. The first time the food was good, fresh & tasty. This time, not so much. I ordered the Mongolian chicken & it was dry. Threw half of it away. I also ordered the shrimp fried rice & the shrimp tasted overcooked & rubbery. I LOVE shrimp, but again threw half of it away. I won't be ordering from them again. Not at the prices they charge for the food you receive."}
{"text":"The ONLY place that was open at midnight on a Tuesday! Food was good, had the PFR and Sesame Chicken. The PFR was a little on the dry side, but still pretty good. Also had the creamy crab puffs (great!) and they threw in 2 free spring rolls with my order. Will def be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous customer service.  First time I ordered they got the order wrong and offered nothing in return.  Ordered a second time because the driver at least apologized.  This time was worse.  Not only were they way late, but when I called to politely ask on the status of my order, the guy who answered the phone proceeded to tell that it wasn't him who took my order and then hung up on me.  All I can say about the couple times I sincerely tried, with patience, is rude, rude and very rude.  Hope they flop."}
{"text":"Roaches in the food. Took hours to have food delivered. I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery, food arrived hot, good communication.  The portions were large and enough for two meals. The egg drop soup lacked a bit of flavor, but some pepper helped out in that area.    I can't complain, the rest of the meal was good and had the necessary flavors. I would order again for sure."}
{"text":"The food is great for what you'd expect from a little place on the side of the road off 7th street. Food alone would be 4 stars. Love the sign. Just KNOW going in that even if you order and wait it'll be a wait. We were told 30 min. As he told us that I saw a car pull in with the restaurants logo on the side and saw they made deliveries. Great!, or so I thought. We paid upfront and opted to have the food delivered \"in about 30 min\". Over an hour later it arrived. I guess this is still really fast compared to some of the other reviews. We ordered the Family Dinner Special with beef broccoli and sesame chicken. Beef broccoli and beef Kung pao arrived. Both were good but not at all what we ordered. CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE HE LEAVES. He tried to charge us again, Prob just an honest case of wires being crossed since we ended up getting a delivery. My huge problem is the big a$$ oil stain he left in the driveway. The amount of oil that leaked in the maybe 2 minutes he was out of the car is aggressive. He had to know. He's filling up that car with oil on the regular with this leak. PARK IN THE STREET. Maybe why delivery times are so bad because the delivery guy has car troubles? I don't know. That sucks but so do huge oil stains on my driveway."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the concrete-block walls, I could have sworn this was a Valentine diner; I love those now nearly extinct '50s-style mini-eateries. You can't really dine in this place except in the 1-table \"patio\" area near the entrance, since the kitchen takes up most of the little building. That means that it's mainly a take-out and delivery place. The entrance is where you order your food from the friendly lady inside. The food is quite good, a tad above most of the Chinese take-out places that I've tried in the city."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, very good fresh nice portions well seasoned. However, service has lots be to desired. Last Saturday night we ordered for the 2 of us. The food was excellent but my spouse's order was incorrect completely. I was going to call them back, however we were both starved and just ate what was sent. Today I ordered online thinking it would be better chance of getting a correct order. When I arrived to pick up, I was told the cook had not arrive yet (11:30) and they had not received my order. This is frustrating as they advertise late night delivery and nothing beats good Chinese food late at night. I just hope they take this as a chance to improved delivery and ordering."}
{"text":"Unfortunately there is only two good things I can say about this place. Great crab puffs, and an expanded delivery area.  I ordered mongolian beef, which was pretty much like shoe leather. Thin, tough, and no flavor. More onions than beef. I also ordered shrimp lo mein. Noodles were mushy, shrimp not stirred fried. More like precooked shrimp, thawed and added after the fact. Also, a little pricey considering quality. This is my first and last time ordering from this place."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good but it just didn't work out that way. I am actually kinda surprised that they were able to get my noodles To taste like burnt steak and my Mongolian beef to have the taste and consistency of a pink rubber eraser. Really really bad and currently nauseous. The crab puffs were just as good as my Mongolian beef only difference was they were pure liquid inside. No clue what's in these things......... Check that one off of the to do list...... Not ever again!!"}
{"text":"This is both the absolute best Chinese food I have ever had in my life and it's also the smallest place I've ever seen in my life. With an A+ rating from environmental services, health department, the food is flavorful and amazing! I highly recommend! Open late, I think until 2 AM. The forks are very small so if you eat here bring your own, LOL. Great place for takeout!"}
{"text":"Sorry to have to do this, but after waiting 90 minutes for a phone in order , only to find out we are not even being cooked yet - it's a sad day at Good Taste House.  Supposedly a loss of power?  Hmmm. Ok.   It will be a very, very long time before we consider this again.  Unfortunately, we withdraw our support of this once up and coming establishment. Back to Shangri-La."}
{"text":"Finally a great place to order Chinese food online! Good Taste House 100% owns their name and then some.  I made a giant leap of faith one night when hanging out with a group and we decided to get 4 orders of Kung Pao Beef, Szechuan Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Moo Goo Gai Pan.  There are some good places to get Chinese food in the valley, but this place was just perfect. There's three places I prefer to get Chinese food in Phoenix, and with the great food and fast delivery with online ordering, they just made my #1 spot.  The portions are big, the prices are small, and the quality is good. I couldn't ask for more. Love it!"}
{"text":"Wish i could give zero. Grade A health inspection my ass. Found what appears to be a roach fried to my dumping. Spring rolls had the consistency of mucus."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, delivered, and as good as most dine in Chinese restaurants near by. That's enough for me  :-). Orders over fifteen dollars get free spring rolls. Delivery will take a little while from them in my experience, so if you're starving, order somewhere else."}
{"text":"Second time ordering. First time had sweet and shrimp and the vegetables and chicken. Veg needed some slice. This time had sweet and sour check cken and the orange chicken both are good. Three out four so far been good."}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I would, not only does EAT24 suck to use to order through, but the restaurant also takes almost and hour for fried rice and fried cream cheese wontons AND just tonight I tried to order through EAT24 for the last time and after an hour wait I messaged them and they told me the restaurant just decided they didn't want to make my order."}
{"text":"This place needs to get their shit together. I moved to the area this past March and have ordered from there 3 times and only gotten my food once.vas soon as my husband and I moved, we were ordering takeout often because all our stuff was still in boxes. We got a coupon in the mail so decided to call and place an order for delivery. The food arrived about an hour later. It was decent. We ordered the walnut shrimp and orange chicken. So a week later we de ode to order again, this time through their website. We place the order for the thing we had previously ordered and after about an hour and 15 minutes I decided to call because we were starving and hadn't heard from them. Apparently they didn't have the order because \"the online system was down.\"  I was livid and starving...the worst combination. So we didn't order for a few months. This past Sunday, we were in the mood for Chinese and decided to try them again...through Grubhub this time. I figured the order can't be screwed up through Grubhub because it's a third party. So, again, we place the order for the same thing. After an hour and a half, we get a call with by some lady from the restaurant saying their \"fax wasn't working and they just received the order and it would take about another hour or hour and half.\" WTF! Really????? Who the hell uses a fax machine in the 21st century? These people live under a rock. That is some bullshit and this place needs to get their shit together. I will NEVER order from there again because you never know when they will or won't get your order."}
{"text":"When we first moved here, this was the to go place for delivery. Sadly, perhaps due to a a lack of real competition beyoyond pizza, they seem increasingingly overwhelmed, slow of service, and losing whatevever communication skills they had before. The foood alll seems rushed with no depth, and It just makes me sad. Our house loved ordering from a small local place, it's our favororite lazy in home treat. But 3 hours for a mediocre meal, where some things might be wrong... they might be a victim of their own success and need to hire more preople, I want to use them for years to come, but it's not looking great at this point."}
{"text":"The service there was so poor and the owner was rude (not honest with us either).  I won't be going back there.  After waiting two hours for delivery we cancelled the order. I usually love little out the way places, too.  Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by his place since it opened and was sort of curious about the quality of the food, and if it was worth the effort to stop.  So, after getting a very disappointing dinner from a more local store, I suggested we give Good Taste House a try.   I used the online order, I was surprised that such a small shop had a very useable online order (easier than Pizza Hut).   I also see that they had delivery problems earlier on, I was picking up so sorry, no review there. Now the food, and ~60% of my reviews are about the food, not the ambience.   We got three dinners with some appetizers, you may want to reduce that and share if you have a group to feed, you will get a TON of food, the dinner portions are HUGE.  All three dinners were really good.  The House Special Egg Foo Young had fluffy tasty 'omelets' (3!) with a very delicious sauce.  The Mu Shu Chicken was excellent, as was the Walnut Shrimp.   Appetizers: dumpling, very good, not too doughy; Crab Puffs, creamy and tasty, Egg Rolls - Huge and also very good.   All of the fried food was crispy and NOT greasy.  (draining has little to do with how greasy something is, it's more a function of how hot the oil is and the cooking time). They also offer lo mein in place of rice for many of the entrees, we prefer the noodles and not many local places offer noodles instead.   This place looks like somewhere you would never want to eat anything, ignore the looks.  The food is great, everything cooked as you order.  This is right up there with the Shanghai Dumpling Shop in Milbrae, CA.  The food far outweighs the appearance.    Oh, someone commented on the chicken, it appears odd because the chicken is poached at a low temperature similar to sous-vide.  Meat cooked in this fashion is extremely tender and juicy.  From the HS EFY I think they slow cook the chicken and beef, It appears the pork was Twice Cooked Pork, firm and heavy with oriental spice.   We intend to work our way through the menu."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ordered from them and I was delighted. They were available for late night delivery and the food was delicious. They also included a few free egg rolls. The delivery driver was great! So friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I loved this little place, until I tried it! The staff was super sweet and accommodating. It took some time for my order even though it was around 1:30PM and the lunch rush was over. Sadly, there was NO FLAVOR AT ALL in my orange chicken. The crab puff was good and so was the egg roll but my orange chicken was a huge disappointment. It's like they totally forgot the orange in the orange chicken."}
{"text":"I placed my order via phone at 6:50PM. They said 30 minutes to pick it up. I showed up at 7:30PM. The delivery driver/kitchen assistant came out and asked me how I was doing. I said great and asked how he was. He told me he felt really sick. I should have left right then and there. I let him know I placed an order by phone. A woman let me know it wasn't ready yet because they couldn't tell from what they had written down what I had ordered. I clarified the order indicating no MSG and they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. As the minutes ticked by I was trying to see inside to see what the hold up was. All I was able to notice was the sick feeling delivery driver prepping containers for food. At 8:15PM, or 45 minutes later I was tired of waiting and asked for a refund. They did not know how to issue a credit on their credit card machine and did not have enough cash in the cash register to provide a complete cash refund. How do you not have enough cash in your cash register to even make change when a customer pays in cash? All they had was two twenty dollar bills. What a fiasco. I am completely disappointed with this place. I will not return and encourage others to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this Place! Delicious food, I recommend the pan fried noodles with beef. That's my favorite, but I haven't had a bad experience yet. Super friendly staff and very reasonably priced food which is great for anyones budget."}
{"text":"Don't order delivery from here if you want your food delivered on time & accurate. To order food & have to call an hour & a half past the initial stated delivery time to ask where my food is is beyond ridiculous! As is being told not that your money will be refunded but that you can have your food for free next time is bs. I'll NEVER EVER EVER EVER order food from here ever again. On top of that the manager left in charge that was (in training) was extremely rude. Amber or Aimee. Whichever one she was, regardless they were both rude & lack empathy & understanding."}
{"text":"Nice spicy wings and kung pao chicken..."}
{"text":"Ordered my food at 9:26 pm. Was told about a 60-70 minute wait. Not cool, but \"Ok, fine, I'll play ball.\" Still waiting at 11:36pm, decided to call and I'm told they haven't even started my ****** order!!!!!!! See if I order from their asses again. Whoever claims delivery was fast is on their payroll or smoking crack. And I'm leaning more toward the latter (smoking crack) since everything's fast to them. You ever try catching a crackhead?  But, seriously, I'm pissed off. Wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"something special i swear hand down one of the best chinese place!! lo mein have a real pan fried taste to it. i have the curry chicken shrimp with broccoli, now im try to the spicy chicken wing hope to say the same thing!!!! egg roll was good. take a lil minutes for them to cook it but the end result is worth every second for real!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a line cook in a Japanese restaurant. I know how good Asian food is supposed to taste. So I can confidently tell you; for outstanding Asian food, Good Taste House succeeds in several ways:  1) The name of the place is just delightful, I mean look at it. It's like something from a cartoon. I love it.  2) The soy sauce they include with delivery is real, naturally brewed, Kimlan soy sauce. Not that artificially colored & flavored filth that almost every other chinese place uses. I can tell the difference, and it is disgusting. Good Taste House cares about you and provides Soy Sauce that doesn't insult your palate or intelligence. (Yes. I feel that strongly about this.)  3) I can taste the slightly singe of the noodles that have been cooked fresh, in a wok, over a flame. You can't fake that flavor and after having it myself over and over for so long I didn't realize how much I missed it until we ordered from Good Taste House. It's just...correct.  4) Their delivery zone is huge. I mean, really. I was impressed.  5) Their egg rolls and spring rolls stand out from other asian delivery in a big way. I'm not sure, but they taste handmade but they could just be a higher quality. Either way, big fan.  6) Their sweet & sour sauce tastes the way I used to make it myself. In fact, everything there tastes as good as if I made it myself, at the peak of my abilities, in a restaurant, with all the proper equipment and tools readily in front of me. I can make decent Chinese food at home, but an electric range just doesn't cook the same way. This place nails it.   THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED. Well deserving of five stars.  Fair Warning: Delivery times can be a little long because of their big coverage area. Ours didn't take *that* long but I'm willing to wait for food this good to be brought to my door. (Also, come on, the building is practically a shack. They're gonna get backed up.)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, lack of flavor, I would actually prefer panda express (which I'm not a big fan of)... and I'm sorry but hearing about all the bugs people have found in their food.. I'm pretty grossed out. The prices were decent, but I would rather drive and pick up panda when it comes down to it.."}
{"text":"Ordered as delivery and this was the worst Chinese food we have ever eaten. PERIOD!! While the prices were fine and delivery quick , the food was disgusting. The general's chicken had some kind of nasty gravy on it that was awful. The noodles were not even cooked on our noodle dish. The hot sour soup was horrible. The fortune cookies were even stale. I just can not believe they would deliver us a meal this bad. Waste of $30."}
{"text":"Ordered two lunch specials for pickup.  They told me to give them half an hour.  Arrive  half hour later and they said they misplaced my order.  Asked if I would wait another half hour.  NO, and NEVER AGAIN.  Are they on drugs what?"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever seen... it looked like a dog chewed through the bag my food was in. It also took over two hours to get the food delivered."}
{"text":"Try their twice fried noodles or mushu.  They do a great job, and they make it any way you like.  This isn't a restaurant as much as it is a food stand.  It's more like a food truck that never had wheels.  Good Taste House added online ordering which makes it even easier to get food delivered.  They use food 24 online ordering, and the prices are not marked up.  One more reason to never go hungry.  Did I mention that the woman who works there (may be the owner??) is also incredibly sweet and kind?  I always prefer to give my business to people that are nice to me."}
{"text":"Disappointed, stopped for the first time, ordered Chicken Lo Mein, they were out of noodles, had the Chicken fried rice instead, terrible, rice wasn't cooked, underdone, chicken and veggies were overcooked, needless to say, probably won't go back !"}
{"text":"Wow. I placed an online order after attempting to call to place an order. 1. I placed my order at 1130 I waiting 2 1/2 hours after realizing that maybe I should prefer something else. I never got a chance to taste their food nor will I because this is terrible customer service. I called 4 times no answer at all. I would never recommend period."}
{"text":"Hot and Sour Soup was spoiled. Fried rice was missing from order. Spring rolls were cold. Delivery arrived late but at least they called to say it was. Plenty of other better options, so won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and I've been trying out local places. I was craving Chinese food for lunch and remembered seeing Good Taste House when I was driving down 7th Street. My first instinct was to check yelp, and I must admit I was weary when I didn't see any reviews. However, every time I drive by, it smells really tasty, so I decided to give it a shot.  My boyfriend and I ordered two of the rice bowl lunch specials. He got the orange chicken, and I had the chicken with broccoli, both on a bed of steamed rice. Delicious! They are about the size of a panda bowl from Panda Express but so much tastier! And the price - it's a steal at $3.99! You can upsize the lunch special to come with fried rice, a spring roll and a crab puff for $2 more.  I can't wait to try more of the items on the menu based on my experience today. I'm attaching the menu in the photos. Hopefully the presence of a Yelp review will drive more business their way, because it's definitely a hidden gem. :)"}
{"text":"Order form this place a few months back and it was ok food. Tried to order again and it was terrible services, to where I canceled my ordered. They called me back to tell me about a new 5 dollar charge for delivery over 5 miles( I'm 6 miles away). They also had to call back to get the rest of my card information. Had to repeat myself over and over again. I wouldn't order from here, but if you do I hope you get better service then I did."}
{"text":"Gotta love a good ol fashion mom n pop spot. This place has great food at a good price, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm leaving this review NOT for the food, but for the delivery, online ordering, and phone.  The food is actually good...IF and WHEN you ever get it!  I made a $31 order tonight for myself and some others when a sweet friend of mine ordered here last night and she loved it. On the online ordering system, it told me 55 minutes.  So we waited 55 minutes.  And then we waited 125 minutes.  And during this time after receiving the online ordering confirmation, there was NOTHING. No more emails, no more contact. Not even a message saying if there was a delay.  So we decided to call. 3 times. And each time it went to a voice message system. Left a message, but it was never returned.  So thanks, Good Taste House. I guess our order and our money was no good, so we're going to have to go out and get pizza tonight instead of Chinese that we thought you delivered.  Someone else mentioned this and I have to agree, I don't know how they are even still in business when they don't bother to deliver what people order.  I hadn't had their experience with the credit or debit issue since I was paying cash, but this literally happened to me 3 hours ago and figured I would write the review so people know while it's still fresh.  I didn't want pizza and neither did they, but at least it'll arrive and we can reach them by phone.  Good Taste House needss to rename themselves to No Delivery House instead. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Good taste....should be GREAT TASTE! Every time I've had there food it leaves me craving more after I've finished everything. There lemon pepper wings and crab puffs are amazing!"}
{"text":"My advice: Call ahead. There is a wait for the food, but that's only because they make everything fresh. The food is worth the wait. Each time I go, I get the Orange chicken, fried rice, and chicken spring roll."}
{"text":"So good! Perfect for a late night, food was fresh and ready quick. You know how a lot of places have the cold, tasteless noodles? Not here! The noodles are amazingly fresh and tasty. All around, the food is NEXT LEVEL. When you combine that with the convenient times (open til 4 AM), you got a winner!"}
{"text":"Here is my biggest problem.  They need to work on delivery times. 2 hours is not appropriate,  as well as not receiving any thing for my inconvenience.  I work In a business where leaving is not always possible. There fore waiting for 2 hours is not going to continue my business with them. Now the only redeeming factor was how great the food was. This might get me to consider using them again, but if it take this long next time there will be some compensation."}
{"text":"Love their chicken spring rolls (Thats it)! Its a good place to get a quick bit late night. Not in the best part of town but after I drove by it a couple times I finally had the courage to order."}
{"text":"I ordered at 7pm and was told up to an hour for delivery. I called at 8:25 and was told \"he's on his way.\" I called at 8:45 and was told \"he's on his way,\" but I asked to confirm my order this time too. It was correct. It's now 9:15 and I've eaten something else because my food still isnt here, but my card sure was charged. Beware!!! Their customer service was horrible and they didn't deliver. I\"l be going in person tomorrow for refund."}
{"text":"Sadly after 3 late night tries I'm pulling the plug on Good Taste...weak name, weaker taste and service. Each time an order was placed ( i saw it written down and taken inside) and paid for, it was slooooow or lost requiring me to re-give my order. 3X. Yes, each visit I made I needed to re-give my order after waiting and waiting or seeing new customers come and go. On my last visit they also gave me wrong items. After taking the order twice. Unfathomable how communication can get so derailed in a place the size of a walk in closet. Sealing the deal for me was \"the owner\" (clutching a bag of factory sealed frozen egg rolls) stepping up to the plate admirably by stating \"I hire people and some don't work too good\".I had different order takers each time however. No apology given for their mistake. WEAK SERVICE! FACTORY FROZEN EGGROLLS...WEAK TASTE! You know it when you bite into it...nothing fresh about it. Orange chicken probably frozen too...bland chicken, breading, sauce. Crab puffs were decent only...on my previous visit, as they failed to include paid for said items on my fateful LAST VISIT. Did I mention weak service? I can get \"good taste\" frozen chinese food of this caliber from any grocery chain at half the cost and none of the headache! You\"ve been warned."}
{"text":"I do not leave reviews often but this place was SOOO horrible I had to. First off I ordered 40 mins before I came to pick it up and was told it would be ready in 40 to 45 mins, I was still waiting at over an hour after I placed the order. They forgot to add the crab puffs and that was just the service issues. The food was bland, my husband made me check to see if his chicken was chicken on pork because it was so over cooked the texture was off. The Beef was so chewy I could not eat it. The wonton soup that was $5.95 had 4 wontons and 2 shrimp in and the broth again had absolutely no flavor in it. I have never had such a bad experience paired with such horribly tasting food in my life. We threw out 3/4 of the food because it wasn't even worth eating."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 items to go. The fried walnut chicken with mayo was as good as you'd get at many dine-in places, while the vege egg foo yung and beef lo mein were a bit sub par.  The vege egg foo yung was dry and clustered with vegetables on the top and none of the typical gravy.  The beef lo mein was overloaded with green onions that weren't cooked thoroughly enough.  They were nice enough to include a couple of egg rolls complimentary with our order.  That was much appreciated.  The big problem with this place is sanitation.  The owner needs to clean up the kitchen big time. The kitchen floor was littered with food debris. Walls and ceiling looked equally dirty, and everything appeared covered in a coat of greasy gray grime. I guess I was also a little surprised by the pricing of this place.  They charge the same prices for entrees as many sit-down restaurants, with average entrée price around $9. That seems a little aggressive for true hole-in-the-wall food. And while waiting for our to-go order, I sat on a broken chair under partial shade in 110-degree heat.  Can't see a return trip, except maybe late at night when nothing else nearby is available."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, and the portions were huge. It is pricey but definitely worth it.  I'd just avoid the orange beef. Didn't have any flavor to it though, however, the Kung Pao, Fried Rice, and Mongolian Beef were a-MAZE-ing"}
{"text":"Late night Sunday night delivery (until midnight).  That got us off on the right foot!  I'm actually about 1/2 a mile outside of their delivery area, but I took a shot.  I ordered my food online so that if they decided they weren't going to deliver to me, they would have had to call and break the news to me.  I got lucky.  However, I did have to call them because the delivery was later than the hour and 10 minutes they committed to, and when I did call, they informed me that I was outside the delivery area and that they wouldn't always be able to deliver to me, but they would if it was slow.  I had the same conversation with the woman who brought the food to the door.  I figure if I behave nicely and tip well, they'll be more inclined to deliver to me when I ask for it.  On to the food!  I ordered cashew beef with lo mein noodles, chicken egg foo young, shrimp fried rice, and crab puffs.  Because I ordered as much as I did, I got a free order of 4 egg rolls with my order.  The cashew beef was the best I've eaten and the lo mein noodles were delicious as well.  The egg foo young was presented a bit differently from what I'm used to, with a mixture of chicken and vegetables on the side of the egg foo young patties and gravy.  I don't order this dish too often because it doesn't always set well, but this did and it was excellent.  The crab puffs were a bit tough but that didn't stop me from eating every last one of them.  I was saddened by the egg rolls, which were among the tiniest I've seen.  I like egg rolls that are about the size of the cardboard in a roll of toilet paper; these were more the size of a pack of life savers.  I ended up not eating the shrimp fried rice.  One oddity about their menu that I haven't gotten to the bottom of yet:  no chicken fried rice on the menu.  There's a chicken CURRY fried rice, but no regular chicken fried rice.  So I guess if I want that I'll have to phone in my order."}
{"text":"Being new to town we were very pleased that this was one of the few places in the 'hood that delivered around midnight. We've always passed this place and before I continue the big chicken on the outside definitely speaks for the quality chicken they cook in our opinion.  Between another local place we first ordered from and this place, based off fried rice that we ordered I think the other place \"tasted\" better so I can't give Good Taste House 5 stars just yet. However, their chicken was awesome, tasted fresh, and long story short didn't have the tacky microwaved taste of common places.   The chicken, customer service and delivery alone make this a tie (though if I could I'f give 4.5 stars to Good Taste House) with our other more local spot in terms of stars. Either way, we will likely always order delivery from Good Taste House as the online ordering is simple and effective. As far as driving by for pickup, unless I craved great chicken it would go down to what is closer to where I am at particularly. I will update my review when I try my personal favorite, chicken and broccoli, which the other place just failed miserably on. Great place and great first experience for us."}
{"text":"Late night delivery/dining options tend to be limited....and not exactly anything you'd brag about but our experience was actually a complete delight. Delivery time was quick and the food was not your typical late night grease sludge. This place will remain in our repertoire of dining options"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic hole in the wall great tasting Chinese food at a great price you will not be disappointed General chicken and the Mongolian beef is fantastic I love their egg rolls with chicken"}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for them is their late night hours after the bars close on 7th St. I've gotten food here a couple time and not impressed. It's a shack restaurant on the site of the road and when sitting outside waiting for food there are dogs barking on the side of restaurant. The shrimp fried rice was burnt period."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time since the new owner has taken over. Well if you loved the taste of the previous owners food, you will not enjoy this. The chicken they use is pre-breaded and frozen no crisp to it all. I ordered the orange chicken with fried rice, old cost 10 bucks. New cost 18 bucks. The fried rice had so many onions in it that it was not eatable. The food was not terrible, do not get me wrong it did not make me sick, it's not even close to being as good as it was under previous ownership. Maybe I'll try it again in a few months once he has had a chance to get it together."}
{"text":"-1 Star.  Waited for 2 and a half hours for delivery, offered free spring roll?!?  Still waiting..."}
{"text":"These people take your money and then don't give you the food. My friend ordered from them and now will have to go to her bank to stop payment. She waited four hours and we went to bed hungry. Like another Yelper mentioned, there is no way to get through to them on the phone."}
{"text":"I think I feel sick after trying to eat this food.  Ewww. Out of desperation we called and ordered food for delivery from this place.  I got the cashew chicken, which I don't even think was  chicken. Some odd substance. Egg drop soup was gross as well.  Ordered side of fried rice which cost extra and I don't think I EVER saw fried rice look that.  Thanks for the most nastiest Dinner ever. I'll go throw up now. .."}
{"text":"Gave it a chance to order delivery and after a hour noone didnt even leave the spot to bring me my food. I called he said he would add 4 egg rolls for the wait n it would be another 20 mins!! I asked him can he hang up n bring it to me now. He said no sorry we are very busy! Um wtf type of answer is that??"}
{"text":"Placed my order at 803. Came exactly 1 hour later food was cold my sesame chicken spilled the whole bag was sticky from the sauce. Ordered house looks mein. It had absolutely No flavor it suckered hardly any noodles I wouldn't pay more than 4$ for it yet I paid double. Spring rolls are meh. OK crab puffs. I will not be ordering from here again it sucks. I will stick to super dragon on 12st and northern"}
{"text":"Everyone who works here is really sweet and probably hardworking. But all of the food here does not taste good."}
