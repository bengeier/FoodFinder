{"text":"Just ok. Food was good but way overpriced. Not sure it will survive at Wellington and 4th av at these prices. Pork chop plate was pretty good. Arrancini was misleading... There was only 1 on the plate. The ball itself seemed baked, not fried. Too hard, and not enough cheese inside. Drinks were not especially potent either.
It was fine but I probably won't go back, especially since there are so many good optiona around there that proved good food and good value."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally have a good pub in Verdun! The ambiance is lovely, the music is great, and the service is exceptional! They have a wonderful and original selection of cocktails, as well as beer and wine for every taste. The food is pricier than what we're used to in Verdun, but the small menu is well varied and delicious. The charcuterie board is excellent, and perfect to share with a friend over nice conversation!

A welcome addition to Verdun's \"nightlife\" options!"}
{"text":"Even though its location is not the best, you should not judge the restaurant only on that aspect. The food was delicious and well presented, the customer service was nice and lovely and on top of that, we felt like they really did take care of our needs.

{"text":"Rapport qualité prix cela n'en vaut pas la peine.Le prix de la nourriture est un peu trop élevé à cause de la reglementation de l'alcool, mais cela n'empêche pas que c'est délicieux. C'est une belle ambiance, un petit pub acceuillant avec une terrasse à l'arrière.
Le staff est sympatique et professionnel. 

Le whippington est à essayer puisqu'il est fait maison et savoureux."}
{"text":"I went with my husband.  The atmosphere is nice, they have kind of an irish/english pub vibe which is kind of neat.  My husband ordered a soup and grilled cheese, and I got the fish tacos.  The fish tacos were great, nice juxtaposition of flavors with cilantro, the fish and sauces.  However, my husband's soup was a this weird creamy onion soup.  Very bland.  The grilled cheese sandwich was bland as well, it was mostly fluffy white bread with a thin bit of boring cheese (how do you screw up grilled cheese?).  Anyways, the blandness of his meal kind of turned us off.  We each had a beer, the service was OK."}
{"text":"Un restaurant digne de ce nom. L'endroit est petit, à peine une quarantaine de personne peuvent y manger et ceci incluant le bar. Et que dire des plats qui y sont servis.Ils sont simplement exquis! 
Au niveau du prix, et bien le total a été de $90 pour 2 boissons, 2 plats et 2 desserts. Mais je ne regrette tout de même pas avoir payé ce prix, car à mon avis, il est très bien justifié.
Ce qui est fort agréable, est le menu. Les chefs le change à toutes les saisons. 
Un restaurant à découvrir et y revenir. 

Seul conseil, vu la taille du restaurant, n'y allez pas un jour de sports car vous serez déçu du bruit et des deux grosses télévisons. Pas très romantique comme ambiance.

Ah oui, l'été il y a la terrasse arrière qui est super jolie et qui peut offrir une belle soirée entre amoureux.
_________________________________________

A restaurant worthy of the name. The place is small, about forty person can eat and this includes the bar. And what about the dishes that are served. They are simply exquisite!
Pricewise, the total was worth $90 for two drinks, two dishes and two desserts. But I don't regret having to pay that price because I think it is very well justified.
What's nice, is the menu. The chefs changes the menu for each season.
A restaurant to discover and back, no doubt.

Only advice, given the size of the restaurant, don't go on a sport day because you'll be disappointed about the noise and the two large TV's. Not really romantic.

Oh yes, there's  the rear terrace on summer which is super pretty and can offer a romantic evening with your love."}
{"text":"Une elle découverte , Super service , bouffe excellente , belle ambiance , menu invitant et prix raisonnable !"}
{"text":"Great staff, location, food and cider!! Their calamari is delicious and made from good seafood! They also have pints of cider!! In summer the terrasse is great for people watching!!"}
{"text":"After a horrendous experience with the Benelux down the street, we found Balconville on Yelp and decided to try it out.

What an awesome decision that was.

Immediately upon entry, we were greeted by a few people who immediately seated us and explain the menu. The decor is nice, awesome music, dim lights - a really cool and calm vibe set the tone of this bar/restaurant. 

I ordered the Nun's Island Iced Tea which wasn't very good. However the unconventional French onion soup and grilled cheese were amazing. Not too heavy, super flavorful, and not at all pricey, this small meal hit the spot. 

Had a really nice time here and will absolutely bring the husband back on a date night!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, awesome service, and killer snacks. I would definitely go back and recommend it to friends. It was a perfect mini date night."}
{"text":"Un autre petit nouveau à Verdun, yay!
Le Balconville, petit pub, vient d'ouvrir ses portes sur la rue Wellington. Vous y trouverez un personnel accueillant et professionnel, plusieurs tables où jaser entre amis et une magnifique terrasse pour les belles soirées d'été. 

Le choix de bières, cocktails et vins est très bon. Il y a d'excellentes options pour tous les goûts! Pour ma part, j'ai opté pour une pinte de cidre et mon copain pour un cocktail dont j'ai oublié le nom, mais il était très bon. En raison de la réglementation de Verdun, il est obligatoire de consommer de la nourriture pour prendre de l'alcool. Le Balconville offre un menu court, mais varié : tacos de poisson (délicieux, ma foi!), poulet, calmars et j'en oublie. Il y a aussi 5 ou 6 choix de dessert. Vous devez absolument essayer le Whippington, un gigantesque Whippet maison.

Quand j'y suis allée le service était un peu long et désorganisé, mais la place n'était ouverte que depuis 2 jours. Je suis persuadée que tout s'améliorera au fil des semaines. 

J'y retournerai certainement, je suis déjà accro à leurs tacos de poisson, hihi!"}
{"text":"Magnifique terrasse. Un petit pub de quartier fort intéressant

Le personnel, l'ambiance et la nourriture sont impeccables. Un choix de bières, cocktails et vins.

Côté menu, j'ai goûté au burger, tacos de poissons (les meilleurs goûtés à Montréal), calmars (ils fondent dans la bouche), grilled cheese, croquette de porc. On retrouve également salades, plats végétariens et quelques desserts."}
{"text":"Drinks are cheaper than downtown and that right there is everything you need and more.

I've been to this location 3 times now once for dinner and twice for drinks. I wasn't crazy about the food the one time I tried it but I will come back and try it eventually. Drinks are always made well and cheap and the fact that it's down the street from my house is an double whammy.

They have seating in the back and front but it closes around 10 pm due to verdun laws. They have one bathroom so yes there's a line up sometimes that's a bit sucky but not much to be done about that. The staff consists of 5 guys could be more but they're super funny and great to be around."}
{"text":"Cute place. Super friendly staff and decent vegetarian fare which isn't obvious in Montreal."}
{"text":"If you are a hipster and don't mind about spending a little more money for a cool place in Verdun, chances are you will review this place with 4 or 5 star! Personally, I did enjoy having a beer with my friends here eating a little appetizer, but frankly, the price did cool me down a bit and we decided to go elsewhere for dinner.

Otherwise, the ambiance is cool and the service was friendly and attentive. The food is good and creative but the portions are small."}
{"text":"Décevant. La salade et les légumes marinés étaient beaucoup trop vinaigrés. Le pain du burger était complètement détrempé, la viande était insipide, les frites étaient trop huileuses et leur coupe en cheveux d'ange les rendaient difficiles à manger proprement. De plus, la 2e bière n'est jamais arrivée à temps. Dommage, car nous aimons encourager les restos de quartier, mais celui-ci a perdu 2 clients."}
{"text":"Nice little place. The wine choice are limited and bad, but the drinks are ok. It's more of a beer kind of place, I believe. The food is just normal bistro-style but the taco were nice. Not too soggy and well packed."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this bistro pub one night around 10ish, decided to try the late night combo of plate plus a pint. What a juicy delicious tender and flavourful burger! Totally surpassed my expectations. The center of the thick patty was how any good burger should be - pink. I will come back when I crave for a good burger."}
{"text":"Un petit pub à la mode, ce Balconville! En effet, c'était plein à craquer pour le 5 à 7 ce jeudi soir!
Nous étions trois compagnons assoiffés pour une bonne bière. J'ai bu un cidre Mystique, les deux autres ont pris une bière IPA québécoise et nous avons partagé le plateau de charcuteries. Un délice fait maison! Mention honorable au magret de canard fumé, mais les portions étaient un peu petites et j'aurais bien volontiers grignoter plus de pain. Mais, bon, le service était très bien exécuté par Sébastien et l'endroit est agréable pour prendre une pause entre amis. 
Un plus: il y a des places de stationnement gratuites sur les rues transversales, car c'est un coin moins achalandé de la grouillante rue Wellington! Youppi!"}
{"text":"De la bonne cuisine à Verdun ! N'ayant pas soupé vers 22h30, nous nous sommes dirigé vers le balcon ville. Point positif : 
- l'endroit n'est qu'à 10minutes du métro à pied 
- les plats sont à tomber par terre tellement c'est bon 
- la qualité des produits est exceptionnelle 
- le service est attentif, et l'ambiance est bonne 
- la petite terrasse à l'arrière est intime 

Point négatif : 
- les prix sont BEAUCOUP trop cher . 20$ pour une assistte pas trop remplie , bof 
- il y a une carte d'alcool limitée, si l'on a envie d'autre chose que du vin
- la musique à l'intérieur est beaucoup trop forte"}
{"text":"This beautiful pub that I like so much is becoming a victim to its popularity. Great patios during the summer, one at the street and one in the back yard, unfortunately with the increasing number of tables and guests seem to increase the wait time for food, and the line for the bathroom once more beers are consumed. What surprised me is the decreasing list of cocktails as the guys at the bar have been masters of delightful drinks, including the calvados mix I had the last time. The well thought menu is almost the same and food is executed consitently, except for my big disappointment, the vegetarian platter, which was bland, and for unknown reason had ingredients that are not reflecting the local products of the summer, needless to say I did not enjoy a watery broccoli that tasted like it has been just defrosted. I still believe Balconville is a great local pub, but the team behind it needs to invest time in more attractive healthier options for the menu as to keep me returning more often."}
{"text":"Great spot on Wellington with lots of ambiance and good food. This is great spot for a 5@7 which turns into dinner and a night cap. The music is good, the service is great and everything just feels good. stop in and see what I'm on about you won't be disappointed. 

Fish Tacos!"}
{"text":"YES ! This is just what Verdun needed - a perfect little spot for a beer with your friends and a-mazing food. Try the fish tacos, the burger or their fried seafood plate (calamari,shrimps and mussels). And make sure to sit on the cute & cozy terrace ! Oh, and they have TV screens inside to show the sports games, too !"}
{"text":"Great little pub in Verdun. Beer list is limited but good. The food is better than average pub food, again a little limited but very good. Service is exceptional. Servers are very polite, knowledgeable and extra courteous. There is a nice Terrasse in the back . It is small so a little noisy but we like this place and have been several times in the last few months"}
{"text":"Verdun finally has a proper English-style pub!

I came in last night to try out their burger after friends of mine had said how good it was and I can definitely attest that the burger and micro-mini potato fries it came with really hit it out of the ballpark. They don't have a lot of menu options but just enough to get you going.
There's beers on tap, flat screen TVs to watch the game, muted lighting, and terrace which I'm sure will be full during the summer months.
This is a great neighborhood place to come by, get some drinks with a friend and get some decent pub food. Since it's in my neighborhood, I'll definitely be coming back more often.

As another reviewer already wrote, their Bloody Caesar is also one of the best in the city. Be warned on hockey game nights: the place is packed and super loud. You won't be able to have a quiet conversation with your friend if that was what you were looking for.  Another side dish which was amazing: their home made onion rings. Among the best I've had in the city, by far."}
{"text":"La bouffe est excellente. Bonne ambiance. Excellent service. Mon endroit préféré à Verdun."}
