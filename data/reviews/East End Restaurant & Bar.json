{"text":"I am not sure why this place has good reviews. I made a reservation a month in advance to celebrate our wedding night. I tried for three days to call and confirm before the wedding.  They have no land line. What restaurant has no phone?! We finally stopped in to make sure they were even still in business. The blonde girl that helped us was very nice and told us everything would be set up as we wanted on the patio.    Night of the wedding: blonde girl has done a 180 and is a totally different person. She basically has no recollection of our conversation two days prior. Table isn't ready. Then they tell us they don't have any low tops which is NOT what I was told two days ago. So, instead of people running around trying to get tables set up, all the employees just stand there and say \"sorry\". Well, why not try to remedy the situation and get us set up? Not one ounce of movement from anyone.   Needless to say we did NOT stay. No wonder there was no one in this place. The staff is horrendous. No idea about the food. We went to Beerhead down the street who was super accommodating and we ended up having a great time.   DO NOT GO HERE. We guess another three months and they are out of business."}
{"text":"I was down in the flats looking for a new trendy place.  When I walked into the bar, the atmosphere was very lively.  We had food and drinks out on the patio.  It was a perfect place to sit and enjoy a nice night with a cocktail.  Each of us ordered something different and the food was really good!   I loved the fried pickles!  We had great service and the staff was really nice.  I would recommend this restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. The only thing worth a two star review is the location. It was nice to sit outside on the patio along the river but other than that the food and service were horrible. It took a long time for the food to arrive to the table and had to repeatedly ask the waitress for multiple things. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, let's Yelp.  This one was strange.  I walked over to the recently opened East End Restaurant and Bar on Old River Rd last night. I got a tip from someone at the East Bank project that this place was low key, inexpensive and a nice place to relax. So I took a book over and gave it a try.  My immediate observation was that this was a night club posing as a restaurant.  While the name suggested a neighborhood tavern in London, the inside was completely different.  The bar was there, but it's walls were glowing with blue neon. The bar counter glowed from underneath too. And the wait staff glowed from the youth of 24 year old women in skin tight black cocktail dresses. They low key was officially nullified with the sounds of \"Clarity\" by Zedd booming through the sound system.  The \"restaurant\" seating was limited to the patio outside, and a few high top tables inside.  No hostess present. The rest of the seating was VIP areas with tension barriers ready to go for later that evening.  The food was fine.  I got the standard burger with waffle fries. In a burger town where everyone has a signature burger this was good enough for the price, but isn't going to win any competitions and I doubt I will find myself coming back if I am in the mood for a burger.    The service was so so.  The one male working seemed to be offended that I had a book with me, and that I was only drinking water. But at least he was willing to refill it for me. The female who was there when I sat down disappeared a few minutes after I ordered, and the girl who took her spot wasn't very attentive.     While I was waiting to cash out, I also noticed a manager walking about, giving out what looked to be gift cards to random patrons.  An older couple sitting a few stools down from me got chatted up and gifted.  At that point I clearly felt like I didn't belong here.  The patio looked nice.  They did a nice job with what they had to work with, but there were smokers out there along with some additional club seating.  Might be a nice place to escape while clubbing later in the evening if you are a smoker.  As I left, a doorman was getting set up to clearly welcome clubbers in a few hours.  A friend of mine went later that evening, and said they were not charging cover so he must have been checking ID's.  So at least there is that.  I'd like to say I'd check it out after hours to get the full nightclub as a restaurant experience but my clubbing days were over years ago, and there are too many options now in the area."}
{"text":"We were walking outside trying to decide whether to come in or not and one of the employees came out and informed us that they have the best burgers in Cleveland here.   That being said, we had to check them out. The ambience is great, it was still early in the day so we had the place pretty much to ourselves. The music was a decent volume so we didn't have to talk over the music.   As far as the hamburgers, I haven't tasted all the hamburgers in Cleveland to compare these to, but I can't remember the last time I had such a great burger. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"Went here once.  Sort of cool atmosphere, but we met friends for dinner and the place looks more like a nightclub so that was kind of awkward (maybe that's what they are going for??).  It took about 45 minutes to get our food, I sat there for awhile with an empty drink waiting for an opportunity to order another, and when the food finally came, the waiter dropped one of my husband's quesadilla pieces on the ground and said, \"sorry,\" but did nothing further (we paid for the full meal, not a fraction of it...).  Food was okay, but not good (I'd give it a C) and the service was pretty bad (D-).  I'd say, go here for a beer, but nothing more.  Also, they don't have soap in the women's restroom.  Gross, makes you wonder what the kitchen is like.  Hope they get it together because the space is cool."}
{"text":"We visited east end yesterday. We sat at the bar and were immediately handed menus but then the bartender walked away and waited for the next bartender to ask us what we wanted to drink. We split the east end burger, it was incredible. The bacon jam was amazing. The service- horrible. Bartenders look miserable. My boyfriend was uncomfortable because they just walked around like zombies and made no small talk with us. They were on their phones the entire time, when we were finished we watched our empty drinks and plate sit in front of us without asking if we wanted another beer or beverage, until we asked to just cash out. This restaurant could be an amazing one with a great view of the water  but it will not make it if they continue to have \"zombie\" bartenders/servers."}
{"text":"Would give this place less than that. I came with 4 friends who wanted to show me a good time, since I'm from out of town. However, an employee Alex told me that a party of 12 who arrived before we did and did not have a order placed to the 1 chef to prepare all the orders would eat before we did. This is completely absurd!!!  Although he was honest, it was completely unfair and completely insensitive to customers who had been sitting at a bar, infested with nats while we witnessed him sticking his hands into a olive container making drinks for someone else.  The service here is less than accommodating. I have experience in customer service and know that its always the priority to please the customer. If someone inquires about the timeframe of food, its always best to try to meet their needs.   I would never visit this establishment again, nor do I recommend anyone else."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. The view over looking the river is breathtaking. The staff is very welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing patio. Lots of potential. Food looks pretty good. Unfortunately didn't even get to taste it myself. Went in early on a Friday night. Not very busy. Was seated outside. Waitress who seated us said the other waitress would take us since they were splitting the patio. Asked the other waitress since she hadn't served us and said the other waitress would be taking us. Apparently they never figured it out. Waited 20 minutes, never got to order, and walked out. Gotta invest in better staff."}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly bartenders! They make you feel at home. The patio has amazing views!! I live nearby and come all the time!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 2 stars because it used to be good and I hope it goes back to what it used to be. Came here a couple weeks ago and I had not been here since last summer. Last summer I always had a good experience here and it was one of my fav restaurants. We showed up and the first thing we are offered is a $150 hookah that is apparently half off that night. We like to hookah but not for $75 let alone $150... Waitress then asks for all of cards to open a tab which is weird because we're all there for dinner. The first 2 things I order from the menu they don't have. I ended up ordering the grilled chicken sandwich. It said it came with avocado and when it came out no avocado .. I asked be waitress for it and she said they were out. They seemed to be out of a lot for it being a Saturday night. Our waitress was also awkwardly rude. She asked how our food was and one of my friends said his tacos were really spicy (clearly he wasn't enjoying it ) she just laughed and walked away. Odd reaction when we're already not having a good experience.. Wouldn't any other waitress offer to send it back or something else ? The place was empty for a Saturday night which I was confused about when I first walked in but after dinner it made sense. To top it off we ask for to go boxes and they are or of to go boxes and our food is wrapped in plastic wrap .. I have heard similar experiences here from other friends so I won't be back here anytime soon. Unfortunate because I  live down the street and was looking forward to walking over here all summer !"}
{"text":"Great job on this newest restaurant and bar addition to the East Flats area. Last night was a soft opening for friends and family and this Friday and Saturday will be start of business with a Sunday brunch for Mother's Day. It's a gastropub with a select but wide-ranging menu. In addition to the bar and various seating arrangements, there's an outdoor deck overlooking the River with an excellent view of the sunsets. Looking forward to more visits here."}
{"text":"This is our second time here within a couple of weeks and the food has yet to disappoint us. The atmosphere and service are really good. I like the fact that it's not that popular here yet and I get to enjoy the whole ambience of the riverfront deck. Please come and visit this place."}
{"text":"Ist time there, service was great, loved it.  2nd time time there service was lame, I am convinced that that the booze was watered down, I ordered another shot, server was put out waiting on me,  my cocktail cost me $ 20.00 are you kidding me? I won't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by East End while home visiting Cleveland. It is a jewel on old River. The drinks are innovative and great. The ambiance chic and inviting. The back porch is a little up off the river so you comfortably get great views of the happenings in the flats . Treat yourself and go!"}
{"text":"Meh is all I really have to say about this place.  What makes it worth it is the outdoor patio, but inside is just a generic new bar with a sign \"all about me.\"    The drinks are typical bar drinks-nothing fabulous, but are still pricey. Food is just OK. Wouldn't really recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"The venue is a nice place. I had a good time at the bar. The drinks were a good price. But my problem is I was over charged and twice at that. I had 2 drinks which were 8$ a piece, I then signed a receipt for 16$ and a 3$ tip. Some how 4 days later I have a charge for 24$ and a separate 10$. I'm just sure you should NOT open a tab at this place. Highly unprofessional.!"}
{"text":"I secretly don't want anyone to find out about this place because it's so awesome and I want it all to myself!  Get the fried pickles! You won't be disappointed. Fabulous cocktails and low priced beers.   Awesome view of the river and really cool atmosphere. The bar is so pretty I'm claiming this my new official hangout spot."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is still open. I've been in East End 3 times and each time is more bizarre than the last. This past Saturday a couple friends wanted to meet there for dinner before going out. I should have warned them.  First, this place does not know what it wants to be. The decor says club, the music could be literally anything, the food says pub. When we walked in at 5 this past Saturday, there was country music BLARING from everywhere. I could barely order a drink it was so loud. If it was midnight, sure, but it was 5pm! The sun was still up. They also play the music videos for the songs on the TVs which I think is weird and super distracting.  The service was terrible. The bartenders can't seem to think about more than one customer at a time. The don't even acknowledge other patrons until they're completely finished with a previous transaction. I skeptically ordered food. I figured a burger would be a safe bet... and it was, i suppose. It was cooked well but it was tiny, funny shaped and flavorless but I was starving so I ate it anyway. At least they didn't screw up the fries.  I've given this place too many chances and will go out of my way to avoid it in the future."}
{"text":"Two patios. The upstairs one feels like a friends back yard. The downstairs patio has a bar with plenty of beer but limited liquor. At 8 pm the food here is an A-  .  At midnight when everyone else is closed the food here is A++.   They serve food late.  Shrimp tacos and lobster mac are popular.   The best part about this joint?  It is NOT corporate. Not in reality, not in feel. It's in an old building at the leading edge of the East Flats at the foot of St. Clair Street. Not in some new, stapled together building. This building has been here since who the f knows. If you are from out of town and want to experience the flats of old start here.   If you are coming for the RNC East End has a license to serve until 0430.   If you're from out of town and want to know the old flats, check out the east end."}
{"text":"Awesome little gem on the east bank of the flats! Great relaxed atmosphere with great views. The food is fresh and delicious along with amazing, friendly service!"}
{"text":"First one of the old flats to renovate and open. I like the new flats but it can get over crowded over there. East end is great for dinner, starting the night or finishing the night. Brunch is very solid with the mimosa special. Only negative id say is the music can be off, like its the radio or one persons favorite playlist. Should get the itouch jukebox."}
{"text":"I wanted to try East End because its one of the few places in the flats that has a late night menu. From the pictures, you would think East End was a upscale restaurant and lounge. Boy were we fooled! You walk in and are immediately hit with extremely loud hip hop music. Seating is limited. You have seating at the bar that was all taken by people ordering drinks and then there is about 12 small tables surrounding the bar. I squeezed my way to the bar to get a menu and had to yell my order. I ordered the black and blue burger and fries. The food came out fairly quick but it was not the burger i ordered and the burger was raw in the middle!  We didn't get any utensils so i ended up mostly just eating the fries. We were the only people eating food in the entire place. THIS IS A FANCIER W.6th TYPE BAR THAT HAPPENS TO SERVES FOOD. NOT A RESTAURANT. We did end up talking to the owner who is probably the same age as me. He did say weekend evenings the dj plays all hip hop and he just goes with the vibe of the people coming in. Sometimes its more club and other days its more restaurant. I did get to check out the patio and that was worth it. All in all, try East End during the day. It may be better and probably more quieter."}
{"text":"Great addition to the East Bank. The decor is fun for a bar atmosphere. They have a two story deck on the back with comfy couches and tables. The drinks are strong and the food I've tried has all been delicious. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"One of the best views in town.  The burger was excellent and our service was top notch.  If you are in the Flats, walk down to East End and enjoy a cocktail on the deck.  I could sit there all day watching boats on the river.  This will also be a great place to hang out when bands are playing at Nautica stage."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, first place in the \"old\" flats to remodel. Amazing patios with an amazing view of the river. Also great drinks, delicious food, prompt and excellent service. I have an absolutely amazing experience every single time I go!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!! Waited an 1 hour and 30 min for over priced cold food. The server was ridiculously rude.  And this was the to go box,"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Right on the water. Literally. Two outside areas, patio up and down with super relaxing yet elegant vibe. The views are gorgeous and they even have tvs outside as well as inside which I cannot wait for during football season. Bar inside is awesome. Great music, food, drinks, staff and atmosphere and not psychotically overpriced. It's my new favorite place downtown with easy, affordable parking right next door. I recommend going here for drinks with friends and or food and they even offer brunch!!! 10/10!"}
{"text":"Mathew is amazing! We were out for some cocktails after dinner on our 5th anniversary and he was so welcoming and really showed us the best time!  He really went out of his way to be the best bartender we've had (as bartenders ourselves) Honestly better than the whole dinner we did before coming to see him! Great people here and an amazing time right on the water in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Late on this review, my bad!  Looking to chill by the water with the wife over labor day and all the usual suspects were packed.  Driving down Old River Road, this place caught our eye and did not disappoint.  Patio was not crowded and what a view, just like in the heyday of the Flats.  Awesome waitress and solid beer selection.  Very updated and food, while a bit long on time, was pretty good.  We were comped on food due to slow service from kitchen, I do think it was odd they served waffle fries with a nice entree.  The night was beautiful so the atmosphere nailed it for us.  Hope they can make it through the winter so we can hit Happy Hour on the patio!"}
{"text":"Greg the bartender is great. Food needs work. Nice place for a drink and watch the game"}
{"text":"OK, I'm a little squeamish about writing this review and have postponed doing it because I feel like I'm giving away a secret. BUT they deserve to be recognized so here it goes...  this place is the best happy hour in the East Bank of the Flats and is the perfect place to kick off your after-work festivities. They have $3 drafts, half-off appetizers and, for those that love it, wonderful ambiance.   I've read that the late night scene is great here but I'm not a night owl and the nights I do spend at the flats are usually at the complex down the street. What I do know is that starting here around 4pm on a Friday gets me a few cheap (but quality) drafts and a couple very-affordable appetizers. Speaking of appetizers, the lamb-lollipops, nachos and sliders are great and only run about $4-5 each during happy hour (till 6 or 7pm). The deck is still wide open at this time and you can unwind from a work week while watching boats lazily float up or down the river. Afterwards, I make my way down the street to Flat-Out-Fridays to walk along the river and chill while listening to the bands.    Service has always been incredibly friendly, patient, and quick to offer suggestions. When they have events taking place, they usually keep the lower deck open for the public. This place certainly looks like a late night club, but give it a try for happy hour and you really shouldn't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I drove to Downtown Cleveland to have  brunch on Sunday by the water.We could not find any to our liking until we came upon the East End Restaurant on Old River Road.  WOW!  We were very fortunate They had a patio(with a terrific view of the water ) and a brunch. They also had a $3 Bloody Mary and Marmosa special. Haley our server was exceptional.  I  had the Steak Benedict and my wife had the  East End Omelet.  Both were exquisite We had a RELAXING time thanks to our server  and my wife and I will return . We highly recommend East End Restaurant. A++++++ to the  East End Chef and Haley our server. Only open for 3 weeks but they are off to GREAT start."}
{"text":"We decided to try East End because there was a 10% discount when I used my CLEseats app. We discovered this app recently from a friend and was happy to get the discount. We had the burger which were amazing. Some very elaborate choices of burgers. Also had the lobster mac and cheese which was pretty good. Loved the atmosphere and especially the view. Great happy hour too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were wondering around Cleveland looking some place to get a bite and randomly found East end on our adventure. Ironically it was their grand opening, which they were selling twenty dollar tickets at the door. This included three drinks and appetizers, I drink craft beers so it was worth it to me. so we gave it a shot and I was very impressed. We really didn't spend too much time in the bar but we enjoyed the sunset on their deck facing the river. The scenery was a huge exclamation point as well as the staff. Our waitress did a fantastic job of taking care of us. Now the food was brought out by servers like a cocktail party and by saying it best the food was the shit.  They had these sliders that left me speechless but what I really liked was the lamb chops. They were so good I couldn't help myself to have another one. I love lamb and it was cooked to perfection. My girlfriend was obsessed with the steak with all the different sauces they put on them. All in all we had a great time and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"East End has two awesome patio decks on the river with great views. I have been there many times (late night) enjoyed a bunch of things off the menu like the burgers (I had a truffle one) which are awesome and have their logo burnt in the top of the bun which is pretty neat, and the mozzarella sticks (standard).  More so I enjoy their atmosphere and choices of expensive champagne like Dom And Veuve. Nothing funner than a night out and a bunch of bubbly. Also being close to downtown it was a great place to watch the Indians and Cavs games."}
{"text":"While other bars along the waterfront had full patios, the patio here was completely empty and there was only one other customer inside (smoking hookah so apparently that is on offer). They do have happy hour including food specials and $3 drafts. Stick to the beer...the bartender didn't know how to make an Manhattan and produced an overly strong, undrinkable concoction.   There is a double decker patio which was the main reason I wanted to come here, but I was slightly disappointed in it. While the furniture is plush and comfortable, the upper level patio is all sun - no umbrellas. No umbrellas means more than just the sun gets through to the furniture - think birds... The lower level patio, accessible via a staircase off to the right side, offers similar furniture. You can find a bit of shade downstairs though from the overhanging upper balcony. The downside to the lower level though is the very loud air conditioner."}
{"text":"Agreeing with another reviewer, from the pics and website, this restaurant looked like an upscale lounge and restaurant with beautiful patio views.    Wanting to get away from the suburbs we made a \"reservation\" thinking this restaurant took reservations.  The \"reservation\" was taken, even with a \"let me see if we have anything available\" response.    Shocked when we walked in the door- we were greeted by a bartender. We mentioned we had a reservation- clearly by the atmosphere and the lack of guests, a reservation was not needed. The patio seating were not tables, it was either patio furniture or high top tables.  Not what we were expecting for a Saturday night out.    The food was mediocre, our waitress/bartender was friendly.  This is probably a hot happy hour venue as well as late night drinks and snacks.    I would have preferred that the person that answered the phone would have been honest with me and said ahead of time that this venue was not a 7:30 dinner type of place.  Maybe we would have come for drinks first to enjoy the view and then moved on for dinner.    I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Suggest the tacos! I was very impressed with the service even while sitting in the outside deck! I think they could use so more outdoor seating but over all the ambiance was awesome."}
