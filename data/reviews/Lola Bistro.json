{"text":"Had a date night.  No reservations needed for this BYOB joint a few blocks off Western Avenue.  This bistro has an Eastern European feel.  Lots of meat filled noodle dishes with simple scratch sauces.  My wife had the chicken pot pie which was excellent.  The crusty shell and ingredients were a perfect match.  Dessert was a chocolate bundt cake with a side of unimpressive gelato.  Was it coconut or pistachio flavored?  We couldn't tell.  The bill was reasonable and the experience was nice.  I'd recommend trying it if you haven't been."}
{"text":"I initially gave this place a 3-star rating, which is NOT bad.  According to Yelp, it's \"A-OK\".  I'm amending my review to 1 star because I'm entitled to my opinion and don't appreciate getting insulting, nasty e-mail from the proprietor because she doesn't like what I have to say.  Seriously, how unprofessional is that?!  It wasn't hard to figure out who it was.  Allow me to share the gist of this exchange: Out of the blue - like 2 years after I ate there, I get a message  telling me to stop reviewing [read censorship], saying that I have no idea what I'm talking about, that my \"whole life\" [yes, she said this] revolves around complaining about an industry she says I don't understand, and that I was pathetic.  [Uh, seriously?!  Yeah, total low-blow personal attack.]  I responded that she has no idea of my pedigree or what I know and scoffed at the notion that she could judge my \"whole life\" based on Yelp reviews.  [She's sending me nasty e-mail because she can't handle my personal opinion of a subjective experience 2 years earlier, and she calls ME pathetic?!  Yeah, that's obviously PSYCHO.]  I suggested that instead of spewing her negative energy and vitriol, she could use the energy to improve her business so people can't complain.  I mean, there's obviously a problem with not being able to take criticism constructively, which seems like an issue in an industry where you're trying to please people.  It's not personal lady - get a grip.  Is she running a business? If so, you would think she would want to improve it to entice and keep customers, not insult them.  But, according to her, what do I know?  Her actions and comments are beyond rude, ill-mannered, stupid, and unprofessional.  I certainly won't be back and won't be recommending this place to any of my numerous friends and colleagues, who trust my opinion and seek out my recommendations in the industry I supposedly know nothing about (if she only knew - I want to brag so badly - ha ha).  Her loss."}
{"text":"Great place. I had the carbonara with housemade bacon and fettuccine; Faithful Dining Companion had the seafood special, grilled salmon with tiny lentils and creamed sorrel. It was all excellent. Easy parking and not crowded. A well kept secret!"}
{"text":"Lola is probably the nicest restaurant in the North Side. Yelena is a great, friendly waitress and her husband, Michael, is the chef. The food eclectic, ranging from Russian dishes to Thai. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem tucked away in the North Side.  Simple but elegant, and perfect for a date or special occasion.  How are Darden restaurants so crowded on the weekends when there are places like this to go?  This is not a place for hoi polloi."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Lola Bistro. This place just opened tonight and it was rather busy!    All of the food is house made as well as locally sourced. The menu describes the cuisine as contemporary comfort food. I thought the ambiance was casually romantic and the dining area thoughtfully decorated with artwork that is for sale. The menu has a creative mix of dishes from around Europe, artesian cheese and house charcuturie specials, and a seafood and meat special. It is BYOB with a reasonable 5 dollar corkage fee.  I ordered the ribeye special while my girlfriend decided on the Lamb Bolognese. I really enjoyed my dish that was served with sauteed vegetables, mashed potatoes, and a house made steak sauce. My girlfriend most definitely enjoyed her dish, and we both joined the clean plate club. For dessert we had the russian honey cake that most everyone around the restaurant seemed to be enjoying. It's made in house by the Chef's wife and was creamy and delicious.  Overall, this place truly impressed us. The service was excellent and the wait for food was not long. For a place that just opened, with a full dining room, that was pleasantly surprising."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check out this place since reading about in the City Paper and finally made it over there on a Wednesday evening. At 7:30pm, I was surprised to find the restaurant empty. No other guests came in the entire time we were there. The decor is simple and rustic. We ordered the Siberian dumplings filled with lamb and beef to start. They were delicious! I had the seafood special: seared scallops on creamy polenta with arugula salad and roasted red pepper sauce. My companion had the lamb bolognese. While some have complained of small portions, the bolognese was very generous. And three large scallops is pretty typical. The food was great! And don't skip dessert! The Russian honey cake was something pretty special, and I couldn't imagine anything better until I tried my companion's cannoli. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food. The portions are perfect and so are the prices. BYOB is a plus!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early Saturday dinner with my boyfriend. The restaurant has a nice ambiance - very cozy and well lit (though no AC). We got the cheese plate to start which was delicious! It was a simple plate with three healthy slices of cheese and some candied walnuts and honey. As for the mains, I got the lamb croquettes and my boyfriend got the chicken gumbo. They were both decent but underwhelming considering the price tag ($18 and $16 respectively). There wasn't anything in the preparation or in the ingredients that seemed to warrant the prices. In the end, the best thing was the cheese plate, which didn't involve anything actually cooked in the restaurant, so that was a bit disappointing. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back, though it is conveniently located near the Aviary."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant for a special occasion and stumbled upon this on yelp. It is a fantastic restaurant nestled in the North Shore. It is a BYOB and all of our food was fantastic. It's a great place for a date or a special occasion. International comfort food at its finest!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night with friends, our food was really great, salads, specials, scallops, we all had different dishes and everyone was very satisfied.  Charming, casual, good service, excellent food, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Three star experience in my book, but I gave an extra star for concepts and innovation.  It was hot and the air conditioning was either not on or ineffective. I had to get up myself to turn on the fan. The server was busy... perhaps  because we sat down at 5:30pm a tad early and she was still doing setup. The menu is exciting and I think the creative approach and variety is wonderful. However the execution of some of the concepts was only fair. The flavors were generally good but leaned toward bland. The gnudi (all-cheese gnocchi) were surprisingly bland. Their version of saag paneer - bland and dry. Their meat dumplings - good but heavy and the dough and sauces were bland. The lime Caesar had more flavor than any of the other dishes but alas it was still just a salad. Good but bland overall. The black currant ice cream dessert was quite tasty.  Work on execution of spice and flavor from the framework of the bold concepts and this place will be unstoppable."}
{"text":"Charcuterie amazing, carbonara no cream but like the pulled pork idea, great ribeye, clean and great fusion bistro. A true on the North Shore.  No ghetto here."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: fancy dining = small portions and plate art. Delicious and creative menu. BYOB. Intimate dining room, making it a great place for romantic dinners.  Lola Bistro is a hidden gem in the North Side. A group of us went here for NYE because it was one of the only places we called that had seating available for a group of six (we waited until the last minute to make reservations). They had a prix fixe menu of appetizer, salad, entree, dessert and champagne for $50 in addition to their regular menu. The NYE special was a great deal and really allowed me to get a good sampling of their food offerings, although only the salads and desserts were regular menu items. I don't remember exactly what the appetizer was but it was the size of one bite. My caesar salad was a much bigger portion and it was nice and light. The pork entree was pleasant, slightly too fatty for my liking, but hey, it was pork. The hubby got the Smoked Lamb from the menu and he loved it. Lastly, the dessert. We got the Russian Honey Cake per recommendation from the waitress and I do not regret it one bit. It's not quite like cake as you might expect so it might seem a bit dry, but the flavor....it's not overly sweet, but perfectly sweet. Kind of tastes like a honey graham cracker cake? But better! It definitely was a great ending to the meal."}
{"text":"My friends live in the Mexican War streets so it was exciting that a new restaurant open up down the street.  We decided to have a girls night!  The restaurant was rehabed and they did a great job! It is cute and cozy.   They have a chalk board menu of rotating specials and a set menu.  The options are good but I just wish the menu was a little bigger.  I decided on the house salad and Moroccan dish.  Everything was great! Everyone loved their dishes except for the crab cake (it was dry and mostly filler).   PRO: BYOB, very friendly service, great food, quaint interior  CON: Very small menu   Overall: Loved it, we will be back!"}
{"text":"OK, so let me tell you about how awesome this place and it's owners are. I went to a private party there. The private party had a set menu that we were told about in advance. So, I knew that the only thing on the set menu that I would be able to eat is the salad and dessert. I was fine with that, actually I was looking forward to the honey cake.   When they served the first course, the waitress/owner (Yelena) asks me what is wrong, because I am not eating it. I explain that I don't eat meat, but that I understood that there was a set menu before we got there, and I was ok with eating salad and cake. She was not having it. She went back to the chef/other owner/her husband (Michael) and asked him if he could make something special for me!! It was the sweetest thing ever!  So here is what I got (remember these are probably not normal menu items, but are made with normal menu items):  Housemade paneer with homemade mustard and pepper bread- the paneer was different than any paneer I had before. It wasn't squeeky and plasticy like the kind out of a package. It was smooth and almost a goat cheese texture. Very good. The mustard was sweet but also mustardy. I really liked it. The bread was also amazing, hard and crunchy with the right amount of pepper.  Lime Caesar- This was your basic caesar salad. The dressing was really tasty and there wasn't too much dressing.  Saag Paneer-This was a much fresher take on spinach and paneer than I have ever had before. The spinach was obviously fresh and a little sweet (coconut, I think) the rice was cooked perfectly and the onion chutney was great!  Russian Honey Cake- To die for! This is not an overly sweet, kill your taste buds with sugar kind of cake. It is just sweet enough for you to appreciate all of the textures and flavors going on in it's 8 layers.   Overall, AMAZING! My BF and I already have plans to go back!"}
{"text":"Intimate atmosphere, efficient service, convenient location and BYOB make Lola Bistro a solid dinner or brunch option. Appetizers are well portioned and flavorful. The Carbonara could improve with seasoning, but the vegetable tofu lasagna is top notch. Worth checking out for any Pittsburgher!"}
{"text":"Really cute bistro with a Sunday brunch at a very reasonable $15 prix fixe.  I had the vegetarian quiche with salad and it was delicious. Lots of cheese and the salad was very generous!    This bistro is in an up & coming area of town. They accept reservations and take credit cards.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After attending a special tasting event here I HAD to come back and explore more of the menu. So I grabbed a family member and made reservations for us. I was surprised by how empty the place was on a Friday night (when we ended up coming in), and after the meal I had here I really hope they're more hopping in the summer when Pittsburgh winter weather isn't striking in full force. They 100% deserve to be.  Firstly, I love the place itself. It's cozy, as any business in a true older Pittsburgh building is. And between its choice of eye-catching artwork and the way the dim lighting makes the place look like its painted with pastel colors, it's super cute and charming and endearing. While it admittedly has the awful heating or lack thereof you'd also expect from an older Pittsburgh building, as long as you bring some layers you'll be perfectly comfortable while eating here in the winter. (I can't comment on its summer temperatures as of yet.)  And not only do I love Lola's layout, but man, the menu! Lola Bistro's known for changing up its menu to match what's available by season, as it makes its food from scratch, often with local if not homegrown ingredients. When I went my dining partner and I explored a decent chunk of the menu, as we ordered and split 3 appetizers - their lime caesar salad, homemade bread with bacon and fig jam, beef and lamb sausage - and 1 entrée, their noodle bowl. We also took dessert home. And we 100% loved what we got! Well, ok, more like 99% loved what we got. Let me explain.  The caesar salad - complete with a homemade dressing that had its own dash of lime flavor - was honestly just fantastic; it was crisp, fresh, and savory, and made for a perfect starter. I wish I could say the bread was as amazing. Well, that's not quite right; the bread itself was amazing - the jam tasted, well, interesting. Certainly not bad and admittedly a little hard to describe, but I can say that it was heavy on the fig flavor and not so much on the bacon flavor. I'd been excited to enjoy that blend and while what I got tasted just fine, I admittedly was a little disappointed. Fortunately, the jam was the only \"letdown\" (and I use that word loosely here since I did enjoy it), as the seasoned blend of beef and lamb in their sausage (and in the soup's meatballs) was to die for. And the soup's overall mix of mushrooms, and coconut noodles along with those delicious meatballs was just all kinds of tasty, and perfect for a Pittsburgh winter. Honestly, after all of that we were too full to eat any more. I had, however, to order a piece of Russian honey cake to go. It's Lola Bistro's prize-worthy dessert and you'll find nothing quite like it in Pittsburgh. \"Delicious\" doesn't even begin to describe this light, fluffy, creamy, delectable dessert.  My final verdict is that Lola Bistro is a must-eat place in Pittsburgh. At the very least you need to come in and try their excellent dessert, but the rest of their menu is SO worth exploring; a lot of the flavors and recipes here are unique to Lola in this city and are so worth experiencing. My only caution for fellow diners was that even in an empty house service seemed a little slow. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally willing to sit a little longer and wait for my food, especially in a place that makes so much from scratch and tries to keep their meals as fresh as possible. But with that in mind I don't recommend Lola Bistro to a diner who's got to leave on a deadline. I do, however, recommend them for a wonderful and relaxing evening out with a friend, family member, or a date - they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The food is amazing.  We enjoy BYOB establishments and this is one of our favorites.  It's slightly pricy, but not too bad for high-end cuisine with fresh local ingredients.  Would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by a new bistro on the North Side, an area which I hope becomes a zenith for Pittsburgh food and culture, given its rich history.   Lola was tucked away, amid the warehouses and rowhouses, and is a tiny, quaint husband and wife establishment.   My girlfriend and I were the first 2 people to walk in, shortly followed by another couple.  The menu looked brief and intriguing, and I generally feel most menus should not be any more than a page.  I opted for the charcuterie and cheese plate for an app. The cheeses, including a cave aged goat cheese, and a delicious manchego were awesome. The cured meats, including a duck liver I believe, were also quite tasty.  When compared to the Salumi platter at Cure, for a mere 9 dollars more, there is alot more food available.  Our mains were crab mac and cheese, while my girlfriend had ordered the spanish mackeral. Both were cooked with precision and care, but seemed to lack any distinct contrast in flavors. I would be curious to try the flame grilled Ribeye.  I wish LOLA all the best, and I would chalk these issues up to growing pains."}
{"text":"Delicious cheese plate, entree noodles were home made (very well done), and the Russian Honey Cake was amazing for dessert! Eat the cake!!"}
{"text":"terrible, thin steak overdone not seasoned. bland food, nosalt and pepper to season the bland food. noisy, cold small. terrible location with street parking in dark surrounded by graffiti marked up buildings."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service- we went for brunch and really enjoyed ourselves. Cute environment- feels like a little piece of Europe in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food from scratch in a cozy, casual atmosphere. Don't forget to BYO and enjoy delicious, fresh food from chef Mark & Co. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is really nice. Great wine food, nice atmosphere, different menu but everything is really good. Really should be a go to place to relax, have good creative food, and bring yo your best wines."}
{"text":"We dined here last week before a concert at near-by Manchester Craftsmens Guild.  I believe the Chef's wife was our waitress.  Service was top notch.  We were well cared for.  Lola is a BYOB, with reasonable corkage , so that is a definite plus.  We found the ambience to be quite nice also.  It was quiet, and the decor was just fine.  I guess the food was where they lost a star in my rating.  I had Cioppino, a special from their chalkboard and my wife ordered their chicken pot pie off the one-page menu.  Both were tasty and although we enjoyed them, I've had much more exciting Cioppino, both locally and in San Francisco.   Incidentally, when the local restaurant Cioppino first opened I tried theirs and thought it was way too untraditional for my liking.  This was actually better, but would I order it again?  Nah...   I also tried my wife's chicken pot pie, and again, was it nice?  Yes.  Was it memorable?  No. I guess their description of what they do....comfort food,  is accurate, but to me it lacks pizzazz that would set it apart from the herd.  Will we go back?  Yes, because everything but the food was very good, the food was o.k., it's a BYOB, and it's convenient to MCG.  My other go-to Northside restaurants, James Street and Max's sometimes need a rest."}
{"text":"A friend and I purchased tickets to the Allegheny West Christmas House Tours in December of 2016, this past year. One of the brunch stops they suggested, was Lola Bistro. I am so glad we decided to go before our tour, what a wonderful addition to our day. Lola Bistro is a lovely intimate small bistro with 30 seats at the most. Michael and Yelena, served an excellent brunch menu for those taking the tour. The brunch was excellent ! Lola Bistro is truly a hidden gem on the North Side. We will definitely return next year for the tour as well as a special trip for dinner. Many have suggested the seven layer Russian Cake, I am so looking forward to trying. I would suggest making reservations. It is a limited menu, but so well worth it. I also like the fact that it is also a BYOB, that is becoming my favorite way to dine. I don't travel to the North Side often, but I will definitely make a trip just for dinner at Lola Bistro."}
{"text":"Great food service nice nice atmosphere great company! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great little spot in a quiet section of the North Side. Hostess was very down to earth and accommodating. Food was very good, but the dessert vodka  was even better!"}
{"text":"I just found this gem and cannot say enough about how good the food was. A small but amazingly well done menu, with little surprises of things that aren't listed. The restaurant is comfortable and relaxing and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment and every bite!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on Saturday with my family.  It is a jewel in the north side neighborhood in Pittsburgh.  The personal attention of the owners give the place the great service you like when out dinning. Meaning they don't ask you every ten minutes \"how is all going guys\" or \"is everything alright guys\" like in other places. Great service meant they see if you are looking up to get the attention and then they come to you. The food very original diverse I had hard time choosing what to order. We all liked a lot  what we ordered. Only down side is when it's cold and the door opened as the place is small you can feel the cold right away. We all gave them high fives and I will dine again there for sure"}
{"text":"Fabulous, inventive flavors in a relaxed, intimate setting. We were two couples on a Saturday evening, and enjoyed a great meal in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. We asked which appetizers she recommended and got a fabulous set of Pelmini (meat dumplings with sour cream) and short rib Caramelle pasta (named for the shape like wrapped candies). The Noodle Bowl and Scottish Salmon were the highlights, although tender smoked lamb and Carbonara were also good. Try anything with something pickled in it! Honey cake to round out the evening was perfect -- just the right amount of subtle sweetness and cream, complemented by a tart ?boysenberry? preserve. Service was impeccably paced. One of the most enjoyable meals. It is hard to believe that this place is run by just the two of them!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the meals here and the service is good. The location for this place is off the beaten path, but they seem to keep the place going regardless."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little bistro for brunch on a blustery winter morning.  Waitress was very attentive, the food was superb, and the festive holiday ambience was charming.  If you're in the neighborhood check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been to Lola Bistro twice now, once with my wife for dinner and the second time for a yelp party.  This will mostly be about my first experience though.  My wife and I were looking for a place to eat on a Friday night and remembering that I had bookmarked Lola on Yelp we looked it up and to see if we wanted come here.  Since it was a Friday night and I was not sure how busy it would be I made a call to figure out when we could be seated and was told that they could accomodate us now.  We headed down shortly thereafter and true to their word we were seated immediately.  Lola Bistro is an intimate type place with seating for maybe 30 people or so.  We ended up getting seated in probably the most awkward place in the restaurant at a two top that was sort of in a corner with a floor to ceiling beam behind it.  I guess this could also be construed as good in a way as it did make our table fairly private.  For dinner my wife and I decided to start off the evening by splitting the pelmini.  These were Siberian dumplings that were filled with lamb and beef and came with a dill sour cream and white wine vinegar sauce.  They ended up tasting pretty good with my favorite part being the sauce that came with them.  Then for my entree I ordered the Carbonara which had house made fettuccini, Grana Padano, shredded smoked pork and a seasoned cream sauce.   This also tasted pretty good and I loved both the Grana Padano and the smokey pork.  The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  All of our food was good and I love the intimate setting that is Lola Bistro."}
{"text":"Why go anywhere else?  BYOB, intimate, creative local food.  Housemade charcuterie.  Paw-Paw mustard.  House aged beef, beautiful chicken pot pie, lamb you can cut with a stare.  I've never been disappointed and you won't be either. Great value"}
{"text":"Pros:  BYOB Attentive Service Delicious Food  Seasonal specials  Cons:  Not in the South Side  Went here with a group of 6 to celebrate a couple of birthdays, so we tried almost everything on the menu without finding a dud. For starters, the delicate meat-stuffed Pelmeni are a generous appetizer to share. The amazingly tender pork souvlaki with a tangy tzatziki sorrel sauce was the winner, but everything was interesting, creative, and tasty. My scallops were cooked impeccably well.   This is probably the best hidden gem restaurant in Pittsburgh where you could probably walk in on a Saturday night and get a table without an issue, but I'd make a reservation to be safe. Check out Lola the next time you want to impress a date or have a nice dinner with friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here this past weekend and loved our experience. The menu had several options that sounded delicious and it was difficult to choose. The staff was kind enough to suggest a delicious small plate and made it a double to create an entree for my boyfriend and he loved it! The vibe of the restaurant was relaxing and the music choices were on point. This is a spot I would definitely recommend if you are looking to try something in the NorthSide."}
{"text":"We loved Lola's so much, we came back after the Steelers game for an appetizer and the bottle of Zin we brought.  Again, the place was so intimate and the service spectacular!  We started with the assorted cheese plate, which was heaven, then ordered the vegetarian Saag Paneer.  It was a very flavorful curry dish that was not too spicy.  I wish we lived in Pittsburgh, on the North Shore, just so we could visit Lola's every week!!  If you are visiting from out of town, you HAVE to try Lola's...you will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"Skip going downtown for a nice dinner and come here for intimate innovative dinner experience. This restaurant is probably the best kept secret. It is in the Northside, ran by a talented chef and wife. The food is out if this world. It's is western European. Me and my partner love it here its byob, and very romantic for a couple. The food is very creative a lot of different sauces on the plate. I had the smoke lamb which melted in your mouth there were apricot sauce it wasn't heavy it's like dots on the plate. Desert make sure you get the honey cake. Stacked layers of graham like with creamy layers."}
{"text":"I love trying out new things. We went here for our New Year's Eve dinner and I chose the dinner special. This was a very cute place. The dining room was small and personal. The service was nice. The food was good, tasty, and the presentation was fab. However for the portions I received I wouldn't say the price was equal. I would look at other tables and the portions were more adequate. Wasn't sure if it was because I got the \"special\" or not. I can not say that I will never give them another shot, because the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for PGH restaurant week, their 3 course menu culminated with the Portuguese stew including mussels, salmon and some awesome broth...normal menu looks great too. The atmosphere is cozy and charming yet well lit and inviting.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Favorite meal that I've had in a while! Lola Bistro is tiny with a limited menu which are my favorite types of places. Everything we had was delicious and the service was personal. I had the Scottish salmon tonight; can't wait to go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"A true find on the North Side.  We had attended a jazz performance at the Manchester Craft Guild and were looking for a dinner venue afterwards.  YELP came in handy and we're thankful for previous reviewers and their praise of Lola Bistro.  I have to say without those reviews, we would never have driven by and selected this unassuming building but so glad we came here.  Parking is free on the street.  You enter into a warm, inviting interior, one very quaint and cozy room of an old building with wood floors, tall ceilings with impressive tiles, a chalkboard of specials, and wood tables with tea light candles giving off soft lighting.  The women's restroom is brightly lit with exciting artwork.  When entering, a server pointed to an empty table for us (later we noticed that those entering knew the drill and they headed to an empty table on their own).   We perused the menu touted as comfort food (and their website states this is a farm-to-table concept restaurant).  My husband landed on the chicken pot pie and I opted for the noodle bowl.  We started with the pelmeni which the menu states as being \"Traditional Siberian dumplings filled with beef & lamb. Served with ramp infused sour cream & scallion oil\".  They were quite good and the portion satisfying for the two of us.  I tasted my husband's chicken pot pie and it was so good it would be my choice next time.  Note it's not like a usual pot pie as I'm not really into those.  This one is constructed and looks different in a good way and I felt was more nutritious than just any 'ol pot pie.  And my noodle bowl, which the menu states as \"Beef & lamb meatballs, pho broth, house made cilantro gnocchi, pickled porcini & house kimchi\" was fabulous and very hearty and filling.  The only downside was that the more I ate, there was an overwhelming taste that grew and stayed with me such that I found I couldn't finish the dish.  Not being aware of the particular flavors, I couldn't identify what it was, but I only know I found it overpowering and took away from my like of the overall dish.  Nevertheless, very good.  As others have mentioned, it's BYOB with a 5.00 cork fee and the interior can be a bit drafty whenever the front door is opened.  A nice overall experience and we're glad to have found this venue.  Hey!!!  I just noticed looking thru the photos -- the plating is sometimes thoughtfully and artfully done and other times, just not.  Take a look at the photos for the pelmeni!  Sad face."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! We had an absolutely lovely dining experience at Lola Bistro. The ambiance is so cozy and my husband and I were having such a great time, that we didn't want to leave. This is certainly a diamond in the North Side rough.  We ordered the charcuterie, dolmas, and pelmeni for appetizers.  I was so impressed with these little dishes. The charcuterie was no joke. I'm usually not a big fan of sweetbreads, but the lamb sweetbread was surprisingly good. The lamb and beef dumplings (pelmeni) may have had the best texture of any dumpling I've ever tried EVER.  And I'm always on the lookout for a good stuffed grape leaf, so the dolmas hit the spot.   For my main dish, I ordered the lavender lamb bolognese. It was pretty darn yummy- I love a good homemade noodle. I was hoping for just a little more flavor contrast in the sauce though.   The Russian honey cake was to die for. I would look up the recipe and make it for myself weekly, but that beast is like 8 layers and looks like a lot of work...So I'll just visit Lola Bistro when I need a fix.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The setting is very quaint in an attractive old building in Pittsburgh's North Side's West Allegheny neighborhood that has apparently served as a restaurant of some sort since 1938. The neighborhood is quiet and there's plenty of street parking available. The inside is charming and cute. The small cafe-like setting boasts high ceilings and interesting art on the walls. Service is cheerful and friendly, and place settings are properly reset for each course. The moderate size menu is quirky (in a good way) with Eastern Europe meeting Asia. The fact that all of the food is made from scratch with fresh ingredients (some even grown by the owners, apparently) shows in the quality of the dishes. The artisan cheeses (complete with delicious candied walnuts and lavish crackers, which were a nice substitute for bread), Siberian dumplings filled with beef and lamb, lime Caesar salad, Sumatran chicken curry (very unique with Peruvian potatoes and pickled blueberries), Lamb Croquettes (with a Grecian potato salad and a tasty hot pepper relish), and Russian honey cake were all rock star dishes to remember. The salmon bisque, which wasn't flavorful enough for my tastes, didn't reach the same level. It's BYOB and prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a delicious anniversary dinner at Lola Bistro on a Saturday evening. We started with the charcuterie special which consisted of goose pate, lamb prosciutto, and tasso ham, a variety of pickled veggies, and a super tasty jam. For our main course, I chose the Cioppino and my boyfriend had the Carbonara. Both dishes were cooked to perfection. We finished with a delectable slice of Russian honey cake. Awesome food, contemporary decor, and only a $5 corking fee!"}
{"text":"What a nice find! Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood in the North Side.  Quiet, intimate and cozy. Food was so delicious and service was great - in laws are still talking about our meal. Prices are reasonable too - all entrees were at $20. Our table had the asparagus soup, pelmeni, chicken pot pie, noodle broth and the pear torte. The pelemni could have used a little bit more salt but seriously everything was so tasty."}
{"text":"New restaurant in a transitioning part of Pittsburgh. When I was a student this was the hood. Now I see restaurants, pubs, and the streets full of life. Lola Bistro is contemporary comfort cuisine, served in a repurposed house. There are very few tables here, all in one room, with eclectic art on the walls. They charge a mere $5 per bottle corkage fee so we all brought bottles. The menu is truly international, but without a theme - it is all over the place. I went with Russian-Vietnamese (?!). My appetizer was pelmeni, Siberian lamb & beef dumplings served in an interesting herb infused sour cream sauce. For my entree I selected a pho inspired lamb & beef meatball bowl, with house kimchi, pickled porcini and cilantro gnocchi. I took a chance with this kaleidoscope of flavors, but the chef actually pulls this one off with flying colors. Lola Bistro is cash only, so bring some green with your bottle."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I'd recommend it to anyone! It's BYOB and the food is top notch. Make sure to make a reservation and save room for the 7 layer Russian honey cake!!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible meal on 3/5/16. Cilantro pasta with lamb was amazing. Pho with gnocchi and lamb meatballs was equally great."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, especially the labneh, pelmeni (Siberian dumplings), and honey cake. The fettuccine carbonara was also extremely tasty, and also surprisingly light and fluffy."}
{"text":"I want you all to know the glorious FIVE STAR experience I just had here the other night! Could this be one of thee most underrated restaurants in Pittsburgh? It just might be, so please get here and get ready to be blown away because it really blows up and you end up not getting a reservation!  It's little unassuming corner joint, but when you walk through the door you're pleasantly surprised by the calm atmosphere. The aesthetic was very clean, with glowing tea lights and cream shades covering the windows. The service was just impeccable too, as our waitress was friendly and open to us asking questions about the menu.   We started off with one of their specials, the Mackerel Mousse with homemade pepper crackers. I was a little nervous having not tried something like this before, but since I'd read past reviews that said to get it, I trusted my fellow Yelpers! Good thing I did, because it was incredible! The mackerel was a perfect whipped sensation, sprinkled with some bright orange caviar. But, let's talk about the homemade pepper crackers... That tasted more like shortbread cookies. Man were they good, and our waitress kept bringing us more! It was a treat that I never wanted to end, even at the beginning of our meal!  I took a quick glance at the top of the menu, which advertised the bistro as \"American comfort food.\" Let me tell you, it's comforting to know that you'll be 100% satisfied leaving here! The menu is small but it was one of those times were everything looked enticing.   My mind was made up pretty fast, as I zeroed in on the Noodle bowl. It had Beef/lamb meatballs, pho broth, cilantro and coconut noodles, shiitake and kimchi for $22. Let me tell you, the flavor of the broth, the homemade coconut noodles and the meatballs, the most amazing meatballs, made for one incredible dish. This meal just rocked my pho loving world!  And it didn't stop there! We just had to go for a delicious homemade dessert. The layered Russian cake was devine, with a honey cream layered between soft cake. The server talked it up, but didn't do it justice until you took a bite. And, she had made it herself that day... Adorable, right?   I'm just so won over... Seriously, go here, and go here now! I cannot wait to come back and share this hidden gem with the masses."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous. Very quaint place on Northside that needs a following. ALL of the food from start to finish was great and we tried everything. Bring your favorite red wine and try this place!"}
{"text":"Michael and Yelena were gracious enough to close down their restaurant tonight to give us Yelpers a few samplings off their menu.  It was oh so good!  We tried the goose prosciutto, smoked chicken pate, lime Caesar salad, Pelemi, and Russian honey cake.  Everything was absolutely delicious! I particularly enjoyed the Russian honey cake. It was not too sweet but just enough sweetness to fix my craving.    I love the intimate setting and that everything is fresh.  Michael explained \"no canned food\" there and a lot of their fruits and vegetables come from their very own garden!  I can't wait to have my next date night here with my fiancé."}
{"text":"This lovely little restaurant has charm and a warm ambience.  It is rustic and decorated tastefully and my eyes were continuously drawn to the lovely stained glass above the entrance to the semi open kitchen at the rear of the restaurant.   Chef Michael and his beautiful wife Yelena are wonderful!  I was very impressed to learn that everything is made in-house from scratch. I had the good fortune to be here for a private event.  Our first course was chicken pate atop housemade honeywheat toast paired with a duck charcuterie and apricot mustard and local black currant sauce (currants from the chef's backyard). The charcuterie was salty and delicious but I found the pate to be a little under seasoned even with the smears of mustard but it was delicious. Next was a refreshing Caesar salad with lime Caesar dressing and shaved parmesan which was wonderful. Then we were served Pelmeni which were short rib dumplings in a light broth. Finally for dessert we had the heavenly Russian honey cake. The tastes were all quite delicious and I am looking forward to going back again soon!  It is BYOB so be sure to bring a bottle of your favorite wine to enjoy with your delicious dinner made expertly and from scratch by chef Michael. Enjoy!"}
