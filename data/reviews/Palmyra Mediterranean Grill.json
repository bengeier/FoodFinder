{"text":"Food: We tried chicken Shawerma sandwich, Falafel plate and Fattoush salad, the first two were excellent and the salad was good. I can say that the food I tried comes very close to being authentic Middle-Eastern food which is not easy to do based on my experience in many different restaurants.   Setting: decent dining area, you order like in a fast food setting but they will serve the food to your table.  Time: the wait time was slightly on the longer side but they were serving a party of ~30 people ago relatively this was not bad.   Price: average pricing, based on quantity and quality it's reasonably priced.   Staff: very courteous."}
{"text":"Fries were so nice. Nice indoor decor but we sat outside. Meat-eater friends loved their dishes. Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent options. Fresh, delicious food. Cheap and quick. Authentic Mediterranean music and decor."}
{"text":"Very good value here.  If you're looking for a great sized meal for two people, get the lamb kebob and falafel plates.. you'll get plenty of salad, meat, hummus, rice, sauces and pitas for two and all the flavors are spot-on.  A bit of a wait but that's hardly a valid complaint given the presentation, quality, and value."}
{"text":"I went here pretty late on a Thursday night to grab some quick Mediterranean food to take home for dinner. Mediterranean it was, quick it was not. It was after 9 so there  were only a few other customers. I ordered a falafel platter to go and a hummus plate for my wife.   They gave me a number for my food and I waited at one of their outdoor tables. The interior is a bit strange and not overly inviting. The place is huge compared to other similar sandwich-type shops. Maybe it's because the place was completely empty, but the wide open space for the tables paired with the bright lights and aqua wall color just came off as kind of cold. Perhaps that's why the multiple groups dining there were all eating outside. I'll give them some credit though- turning the old yellow jersey into a restaurant could not have been easy. The bike shop left them a bit of an awkward space to use for a restaurant and unfortunately despite their efforts it comes off this way.   The food was decent, not quite up to par with Med Cafe but their hours are much more accessible. If you want Mediterranean for dinner this is the place to go. Falafel was a bit dry. I wish they had more sauces aside from the tahini, but I didn't ask so maybe they do.   If it weren't for the wait I might have given a fourth star. I went for some food that would be quick and I could take to go, but I probably ended up waiting almost 20 minutes. I really don't understand what could possibly have taken so long- aside from frying the falafel everything else I ordered was cold and involved minimal prep work. Not to mention I ordered very simple menu items which I'm sure they make dozens of every day. And since other people's orders took just as long and I see other complaints about this on yelp, this clearly wasn't some kind of fluke. I hope they are able to speed things up in the future because I could definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"In the short time that they have been open, had been there 3 times already. The different friends I brought with me all ended up liking it too! Palmyra occupies the long time bicycle shop that used to be on state st. In contrast to the Mediterranean Cafe also on State, Palmyra does not have 'daily specials'. Instead, they offer a fixed menu, but fret not, with over 30 items to choose from, you won't get bored.   Through my visits I have witnessed a steadily fast increase in their business, which has grown to be really good. My guess is that word spreads fast for good eateries =) Hopefully it will keep up. The tables are arranged very far apart from one another, leaving a lot of space in between, too much space, if you ask me. Given the way tables are spaced out now, they could most definitely get more and provide greater spots for dine-in if they decide to expand in the near future.  As a previous review pointed out the waiter taking your orders at the counter will ask you for the number of your order. So even if you pronounce the name 100% correct, they will ask you for the number. Often times I find myself being so certain what I wanted, and then lifting my head to the menu to hunt for the magic number. I am not sure what the reason.   Well the lamb and beef kebabs and schwarma are nice picks. Serving is generously huge, and the meat marinated well and cooked to a light tenderness. The yoghurt sauce that comes with it is refreshing, and the pita bread is served fresh (caution: HOT). Contrary to popular belief, it's a good idea to come here for the chicken wings. This is no typical American food, their wings are freshly fried to order dipped in a special batter consisting of Mediterranean spices. Nothing like what you might have tried in western eateries. Those wings are best eaten in the restaurant where they are crispy. Otherwise the condensed water vapor makes it soggy and there will be a noticeable difference.   For the light eaters out there is the sandwich plates, choice of sandwich served with fries. Or just get their hummus plate that comes with pita. The one thing I would hope to see on their menu is soups. Lentil soups which are usually a classic in Mediterranean restaurants are, sad to say, non-existent here.   Too bad location a little far from campus. It's kind of midway between campus and the square. Otherwise I will find myself stopping by a lot more than I am now."}
{"text":"Very good food and quick service. The prices are also the best I've seen for a mediterranean restaurant in madison.  Its also nice that they are open late."}
{"text":"Excellent (very friendly and chatty) service and excellent food. I had the lentil soup and the falafal pita, and both were delicious. I also tried the hummus plate that my friend ordered, and it was really good too. My other friend got the baklava and reported that it was very tasty.  I liked Palmyra much more than Naf Naf Grill, which is another falafal place just down the street."}
{"text":"I highly recommend chicken kebab! It's sooooo delicious. The food they serve is a lot and you will definitely be satisfied by paying $10. There are not many people in the evening, so it is quiet. Service is good and food is good."}
{"text":"Palmyra satisfied all of my Mediterranean cravings at an affordable price. There is a ridiculous amount of food options to choose from (all with mouth watering pictures) and every plate offers a hefty serving size.   My go-to item on the menu is the falafel plate. The deep-fried patties of chickpea goodness are crunchy on the outside and oh so moist on the inside, which makes for an excellent falafel. It also comes with a fresh salad and a satisfying pita. The hummus plate is also an equally affordable option (approximately 5 dollars) that literally gives you an big plate of delicious hummus, dippable veggies and pita.   This place scores high on affordability and taste, ideal for an afternoon lunch or casual dinner. However don't expect much for the interior decor; you're paying for your cuisine, not a charming ambience."}
{"text":"This is a good takeout lunch spot.  Not much for ambiance indoors.  And with the outdoors dining you must deal with the always exciting adrenaline rush of city buses zooming by 5 feet from your face/ aggressive little dusty birds angling to steal your food.  Which I know, State Street, but it always kind of detracts from the meal for me.  But!  The food, especially the chicken and hummus, is quite good.  And really generous portions.  For an ~$8 lunch I get at least two, sometimes three, servings.  Also the service has always been friendly for me, and their open kitchen has been very clean whenever I have stopped by."}
{"text":"Super tasty! I had the chicken Schwarma and it came with pita bread, rice, hummus and salad.  My grandma helped me eat the schwarma and got a cup of the lentil soup which was just ok.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I went to Palmyra with a couple of friends and a guest. I had heard rave reviews about Palmyra, only to be bitterly disappointed. My friends were ok with the food, but they have never tried \"authentic\" Mediterranean food. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with rice, and it just did not taste right. The rice was salty, and the shawarma- well I don't know what that was, but it sure aint shawarma. It was marinated chunks of chicken- a marinade that is never typically used for chicken shawarma! The salad dressing was just weird and un-delicious. But the worst part of the evening was the service. Whoever was working that night (not sure if it was the proprietor, he wore glasses) was EXTREMELY rude and disrespectful. While ordering, my friends and I decided to change how to split the bills, and so we politely asked to make that change. The person taking our orders literally rolled his eyes in a very conspicuous way, twice no less. He then made a disrespectful comment to me in Arabic about my non-Arabic speaking  friend, right in front of him too. His overall attitude was just very rude, almost like he wanted us out of the place as soon as possible. And it's not like he was busy, the place was empty, we were literally the only ones there.   Perhaps someone who has tasted real Mediterranean food will be able to tell right away that Palmyra is NOT quality food, and on top of all that, it's pretty expensive too for the quality. A waste of money. Definitely wont be going back there. Ever."}
{"text":"I just ate there for the first time and have the chicken plate absolutely delicious. Coming from Chicago I'm very picky about my food and I love this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a bite to eat after the Badger game. They told us right away that they were short-staffed, so we should've just gone elsewhere. There weren't many people there though (a few tables outside, and no one at all inside) so we thought it would be alright. It was not. They didn't take our order for at least 10 minutes, and we didn't get drinks until 10 minutes after that. After another 15-20 minutes, we got our appetizer (falafel and fried mushrooms). It was good, but not great. Our meal came 10 minutes later, and I was actually not very hungry anymore by then, so we brought it home to eat later.   The manager stopped by to offer us 30% off our NEXT visit, which was nice, but we're unlikely to go back. The ambience wasn't awesome, and the food was just okay, so I don't feel like a second trip is needed. Next time we will just seek out Kabul."}
{"text":"I am always a big fan of hummus. So whenever I went to an Mediterranean restaurant, I will order hummus. But this time I order mhamara instead. It isn't that sour as hummus. It's kind of mashed red bean along with walnuts and it is just perfectly match grill mushroom. I definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"I went last night with the wife. There were about 8 people inside when we got there. The menu is up on the wall above the register. It's about 25 pictures, each numbered and labeled. We each ordered a Schwarma, me lamb and her chicken. We both said our orders by name, then the man at the register insisted we order by number. He was kind enough about it, but it was just odd. There appeared to be no language barrier, so I don't know why this is an issue.  So, the system was about par with Culvers. You get your drink and they bring the food to you reasonably quick. While waiting there are some beautiful pictures up on the wall to admire. The dining area is a little wide open and doesn't have anything else in it.    Our plates came with a salad, rice, hummus, yogurt sauce, and pita bread. The yogurt sauce had a mint flavor to it. It was fine in quality, but not my favorite. The hummus was thinner then I'm used to, but good. It had some nice paprika and olive oil on it.  The salad was some lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and herbs. The rice was great. Extremely light and just great quality. The lamb was the best quality lamb I've had in Madison. It was tender with a light seasoning on it.   While we were eating a group of three came in. They attempted to add chicken to a menu item that didn't have it and then ordered by name. Confusion ensued and I had some good entertainment with my meal.  Mediterranean Cafe is still the king of Mediterranean on State St. and Bunky's  keeps the best hummus title. This place is worth trying out and I'd likely head back.  As a note the credit card machine still prints out receipts with the name Tiger Lilly.  I believe the owner of Tiger Lilly opened this place. I'll be curious to see how it shows on my statement."}
{"text":"Like others have commented, the service is very slow.  I've ate here twice and was more impressed with it the first time.  The lamb shawarma was excellent and the servings are very generous.  The salad, rice, hummus and pita were also excellent.  Second visit I had the chicken shawarma and it was disappointing compared to the lamb.  It wasn't sliced as finely as the lamb.  The menu is more extensive than usual for fast service Mediterranean restaurants.  Maybe reducing the number of regular items by a third and offering some as specials would improve the speed of service.     From what I've heard, the food is prepared halal, which is unique for Madison."}
{"text":"It's a much pricier Med Café of similar to lower quality but with way more options, way less people, a way bigger dining area, and a much longer wait.  ^That statement alone sums up this place. They have a ton of options, but they're all surprisingly pricey. I got the lamb kebab because I was craving lamb kebab, but that alone put me at about $14 after tip. I grabbed a spot in the almost empty but super spacious dining area. Does this ever get even close to filled? It definitely makes me wonder...  The service is unbelievably slow. I waited at least 15-20 minutes for that meal; considering I was the only one in the actual restaurant (with only a few other tables sitting outside), my order definitely should've taken 10 minutes max. There were two severely contrasting guys working there: one of them looked like he really did not want to be there at all, while the other guy was pleasant and helpful.  The food itself was definitely not worth the $14 that I paid. The rice was generic, the salad was okay, and the tasty hummus and yogurt flavors were not enough to make the dish good. The pita? Sad. Limp, thin, cold, almost a bit sour, and unappetizing. The saving grace was the lamb kebab. While I definitely wish it was hotter temperature-wise when it got to my table, it still tasted quite good. The char was nice, the interior was tasty, etc. I would've given 4 stars if I could just have paid $6 or so for that lamb kebab alone, forgetting all the other stuff.  The prices, ambience, relatively poor service, and too many mediocre aspects of the food made me regret coming to Palmyra. Maybe I will try this place again at some point because I do believe in second chances and I want this to be another go-to spot for me like Med Café, and because that lamb itself was still quite good. To be honest, the only other place that can really satisfy my lamb kebab craving adequately is Kabul."}
{"text":"Food takes forever to come...how long could a sandwich possibly take? And when it came, it was cold...warm the pita for heaven's sake! And less greasy fries pls. Thank you."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Since my previous favorite Med restaurants closed back to back, so I was really excited when this place opened. I got the lamb kebob and the meat was just ok. It could have benefitted from better seasoning and it was a bit on the dry side. Also the rice was bland. The falafel was pretty good. The hummus was competently done. I will probably give this place another try at some point."}
{"text":"Solid menu, great when in the mood for a good grill. Mixed grill is the favorite although a little pricey."}
{"text":"I was caught by surprise at how good the food was at Palmyra. I guess I wasn't expecting much since from the minute I walked in it was pretty empty.  There were many selections on the menu that I was not familiar with, but I decided to go with the Beef Kebab entree. I didn't want to take a huge risk by picking something I've never tried because I was super hungry. My friend chose the chicken shawarma. The wait for the food was reasonable. It wasn't ridiculously long nor fast food quick. When our entrees arrived I was impressed with the portions. My entree looked like a heaping mountain of delicious food. The beef kebab was juicy and seasoned perfectly. The rice was perfect. The salad had a nice light vinaigrette and the hummus was delicious too. I can see what people are saying about the pita which is rather thin, but it didn't really bother me. I was too happy with the entirety of the meal. This heaping pile of food was completely gone after fifteen minutes. I was so satisfied with my meal that I felt the need to tell the kitchen staff how awesome everything was. My friend enjoyed her meal as well, but she did make a comment that the chicken was a bit dry. On my next visit I am definitely ordering the Beef Kebab again. I will also say that the place was very immaculate. The bathroom was very clean too. I hope this place makes the same impression on others just as it has on me!"}
{"text":"This cavernous, turquoise-painted spot is surely meant to resemble the town it was named after. If you stare at the huge prints of Roman ruins on the walls instead of out the window at State Street, you might almost feel transported. There were about four tables full when we walked in -- more than I expected on a Monday afternoon during the university's winter break.  My dining mate and I went up to the counter and opted to share the $15.99 kebab combo. It turned out to be a huge platter of beef, kofta, chicken, tomato and cucumber salad, hummus, yellow rice, and pita bread with more than enough food for two people. The highlights were the chicken and the hummus, and the item I could have done without was the tiny portion of pita bread, which was cold and lifeless. If you're going to serve pita bread, make it warm, and fluffy, and fresh. I also ordered tea, which, when I reminded the man at the counter to bring it out, was presently nicely.  Overall, I'd say Palmyra served good, but not fantastic, Middle Eastern food, and what it lacked food-wise, it made up for with its bright, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Palmyra made dinner for 14 of us this evening and it was delicious.  The meats and salads were all fresh, tasty, and full of flavor.  The service, from the owner, was personable, hospitable, and warm.  And the restaurant is simple but clean and pleasant.  Outdoor seating is available.  We plan to return!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Palmyra for a quick lunch. It easily surpassed my expectation. It is very enjoyable for people who are not familiar with Mediterranean cuisines.   The menu is really long. Smaller kebab sandwiches are listed on the very right of the menu.They are easily missed. We had chicken kebab salad ($7.99) and beef kabab ($9.99). Both came with good size. The meat was really tender and flavorful. Hummus and pita were also very satisfying. I will definitely go back.  I was told by my Muslim friends that Palmyra offers Halal meat. She said that \"Palmyra purchases meat from a small market in Milwaukee that is FDA certified as well as halal certified by the Islamic center of Milwaukee.\" Palmyra's owner is from Syria. You can see beautiful photos all over the walls.   I have spent some time in Europe where the Kebab restaurants are in every street corner and open till late at night. They are usually super delicious, and also affordable. Although not identical, Palmyra somehow brings back my memory of all the good kebab dinner nights. I am really happy that Palmyra adds  much to the restaurant scene on State St."}
{"text":"So they may serve the best chicken kebabs I've had! This was my first time trying them out, but I don't know how I could order anything else from here on out. Very tender with flavorful spices and charred veggies.. I will be thinking about them for days. The interior is kinda lacking but there is seating available outside on state street which is great in the summer. They do have hookah available. No alcohol. Overall, the staff was friendly, wait time wasn't bad and the food comes fresh and plenty. Def recommend for lunch and casual dinner."}
{"text":"I was not very hopeful after deciding upon this restaurant because the service was inattentive and the decor was lacking. However, the food was excellent. The falafels were some of the best I've ever had and I couldn't get enough of the hummus. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken schwarma and falafel! I really like the vinaigrette salad, too. We ordered delivery to our hotel through the yelp app, which was beyond convenient.   My one critique is that the hummus and yogurt sauces were far too tart and tangy, and I like tart food. It would be one thing if it were citrus; I expect a lot of lemon in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. Instead, though, it seemed like citric acid. It didn't add flavor or dimension, just unapproachable tanginess. As a result, I had trouble finishing the hummus and I could barely use the sauces.   All in all, I still enjoyed the meal. I'll cross my fingers that citrus makes more of an appearance in the future."}
{"text":"Seriously,  this is the worst arab food ive ever had in my long life. Supermarket hummus is ten times better. If you're in the mood for being overcharged and fed a poor excuse of a food, do go here. Note: this is is revolting, i am writing from the location."}
{"text":"Only place with tables open outside, so we gave it a try. Good food, no beer or liquor license. Enjoyed a gyro.  Would go back.  No table service outside, must go in to order. Priced a little too high, but hey, it is on State Street."}
{"text":"To say I wasn't blown away by this place is probably too generous. Ordered take-out last week, which took an insanely long time (like a half hour!) for no reason whatsoever since there were almost as many people behind the counter as there were dining there. But as a new restaurant, I'll give them a break on the slow service.   My lamb shawarma, on the other hand, was dry and not particularly shawarma-like. Less shavings and more meat clumps. If that makes any sense. The rice pilaf was meh, and in a bizarrely heaping quantity. Maybe to distract from the lamb.   I was happy with the hummus and pita though."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean restaurant with very authentic food. The food does take a bit of time to arrive, true to the Mediterranean culture, but it is worth it! Delicious, large portions, and absolutely worth the time and money. Highly recommend the grape leaves and the chicken kabob platter."}
{"text":"The food is super good and healthy. They also got hookah lounge with many different flavors. Love it!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of friends that are really into this place, but I just can't seem to find anything I really like all that much. Their lentil soup is pretty good and flavorful but their was a lot of excess oil pooling on the surface. Their rice was incredibly dry and the hummus had a strange taste to it, in my opinion. The decorations inside are pretty outdated and the tables look pretty rough. I think a revamp of the interior is in order."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the worst Mediterranean restaurants I have ever eaten in.  I had the beef kabob.  The meat was over-cooked, tough, I couldn't even cut it with the knife, I had to pick it up and chew it.  It was also poor quality meat with grissle. The salad was bland, and there was no sauce to dip the meat in.  The pita bread was tasteless.  The place was very busy, but even that doesn't excuse the very, very slow service.  I almost gave it two stars because the fries my daughter had were unusually good, but the slow service made me give it one.  We finally left $25 on the table without getting the bill because they were so slow."}
{"text":"Went back here for the lamb kebab and it was bomb! The ingredients are soo fresh and the hummus is off the CHAIN! A favorite...."}
{"text":"I love RICE in Miami  Ever since I've been hitting up Mediterranean places.   The food was 5 stars  I got the beef kabobs. A little more beef would have helped out  Everything was fresh and prepared perfectly.   Booths inside and slightly lower lights at night would have really ramped the atmosphere up a lot.   Definitely would be a regular for lunch."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner a few nights ago. The only downside is that it's slow. It took 20 minutes for us to get our food, which seems like a really long time for something structured like a fast food restaurant. The staff also wasn't the most approachable,  but certainly not nasty or anything.   Now the positives: everything else. We sat on the patio, and they brought our food out to us. They also clean it all up when you're done. The portions are also enormous!  I can't believe how much food I got for $9. I got the chicken schwarma and it was phenomenal. I got so much chicken and a heaping portion of curried rice. The humus and pita bread were also great. I wish it came with more salad, but that is relatively minor. My boyfriend got the lamb schwarma. It was cooked to perfection.   Verdict: we'll be back."}
{"text":"Never have I been more impressed by a French fry.  Simply exquisite.  Crispy and light. The gyro and falafel sandwiches were also quite nice. I'll definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"Great food!!! The plate versions come with a serving of pita bread, hummus and salad. Very filling."}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with Palmyra. The standout here is the grilled chicken--perfectly seasoned and juicy every time-- and the baba ghanoush. Everything else I've tried (lamb, beef, falafel, grape leaves) has been very good, but not quite on the same level as that chicken.   I only have two complaints: 1)the pita is not that good. It might be better if it were heated. 2) the wait time is often a bit too long.   (Bonus points for free wifi!)"}
{"text":"I'm a falafel fiend, so finding out that a new Mediterranean joint has popped up on State made me do a happy dance. Okay, I had a happy one-person rave.   I stopped by on a rainy Monday night and grabbed the falafel plate for a slick $5. The service was a tad slow, but I think they're still working out the kinks since they just opened supah recently. The falafel was just how it should be: crispy golden goodness on the outside, flavorful and soft on the inside. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Picture menu above cash register helps. \"Sandwiches\" (they're more of what you would consider a wrap) are $6-$10, while plates are about $10. Plenty of Mediterranean options to choose from: kebabs, kaftas, schwarma, falafel, even American staples like cheeseburgers. The portions are more than generous, prepare to take leftovers home. The beef kebab wrap had giant chunks of well-seasoned meat that was a little on the chewy side. Fries that come with the \"sandwiches\" are well seasoned and perfectly crisp. Although service is a little slow, and sometimes the waitstaff don't know where the food is going to (maybe giant numbers handed out with every order would help?), I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nothing special but a gyro is pretty hard to mess up and Palmyra certainly doesn't screw it up. It'd be great if it came in some sort of foil to help it stay in the more ergonomically useful \"U\" shape. Instead it ends up essentially being an open faced sandwich for no reason."}
{"text":"Everything from the atmosphere, service and food was average.  I always am pretty annoying and ask a million questions about the menu when trying a new place. Normally, staff are happy to share their opinions and help me to my decision. The guy at the counter was pretty short and seemed very unamused; he just wanted me to order already despite the store being empty. Maybe he was having a bad day. The food took longer than I would expect from this type of restaurant (no table service, not much to look at kind of place - it seems like a pizza place), but it wasn't absurdly long.  The food was fine especially considering the decent prices. I got the lamb schwarma sandwich and thought everything inside was very tasty. However, the pita (I guess it was pita? Didn't really taste like it) was really toasted and had this crispy texture. It took away from the sandwich, I would much prefer fresh pita. The fries were good, as was the hummus plate. I resented paying extra for tzatziki and them not even putting it in my sandwich for me.  I looooove Mediterranean food so I would probably come back if I was on state and looking to grab a bite. However, I won't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"I raved about this place. The hummus, the falafel, the chicken schwarma. Then I finally got to take friends there. And it was all so salty. The hummus tasted like they poured a whole container of salt in it. The chicken was dry and salty.   I'd really like to go back but I'm scared...oh well, another one bites the dust."}
{"text":"First time eating syrian food. I Had the kabob combo and it was amazing. My wife and I are coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is OK! It definitely has some pros to it. For starters there is a nice patio outside for hot days. Secondly the food comes fast. Thirdly the staff are friendly.  We tried the hummus plate and the falafel sandwich. It ended up actually being a falafel wrap. I kind of was hoping for a sandwich so I'm not really sure how I felt about it. It was definitely good, but I don't know... kind of disappointing at the same time to not get a sandwich instead of a wrap.  The hummus was OK. It was literally a plate of hummus.   The pickles here are extremely salty. I ended up having to pull mine out of the \"sandwich\" because it tasted like pure salt.   So overall this place was decent but not exactly memorable. I would go here again, but I am definitely hoping to try some of the other Mediterranean options!"}
{"text":"Ordered online via Eat24 and they got the order completely wrong. First, we ordered two entrees and only received one. Second, the one entree we received was wrong. I was already back at my hotel and when I called, and they were not apologetic nor did they have idea what I was talking about. Why would this establishment offer pickup and/or delivery services if they are incapable of getting an order correct? It resorted to me contacting Eat24 before they made any modifications and I'm disappointed in this businesses lack of integrity."}
{"text":"I had a hooked deal for Palmyra, so I decided to try it out for lunch. The hooked was for $2 off a chicken shawarma (plate or sandwich), but you needed to get it to go. That was OK with me, as there was a terrible smell in the restaurant. I couldn't describe the smell, but it was bad (sewer like). I got the chicken shawarma plate and I've had better Mediterranean in Madison. The hummus was a little too runny for my tastes. The rice was ok (not too flavorful) and the chicken was pretty good and cooked well. The lettuce salad and dressing was pretty tasty though. The plate comes with warmed pita slices on the side. My friend got the sandwich special. It was a chicken shawarma sandwich with french fries on the side. Mine was about 8.50 and his was about 7.50 (with the discount)."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very courteous personnel,  may have been the owner/manager? who waited on us...I wish I'd have asked.  I had the Lamb Shawarma and the Mrs had the Chicken Shawarma...very filling and as I said delicious.  Being newbies to Mediterranean food the display menu was a nice touch and the gentleman taking our order was very happy to help us make a decision."}
{"text":"I love my mediterranean food, and Palmyra does not disappoint! In fact, I would say that Palmyra gives the Mediterranean Cafe down the street a run for their money. The food is freshly prepared and the portions are generous.   My mom and I ordered a lamb shawarma platter to share, and it was enough for the both of us. We weren't stuffed at the end of dinner, but we were comfortably satiated. For $11/platter (or $5/person), that is a really great deal. It makes for a well-balanced meal as well: meat, rice, salad, hummus, and a side of pita bread. Pretty healthy if you ask me!  Now, before I begin talking about the food, I need to make clear that I am not a big fan of lamb. It might be the texture, it might be the flavor, it might just be the fact that I'm eating an animal that used to be soft and fluffy. Whatever the reason, I'm just not a huge fan of the meat, even though the rest of my family seems to love it.  Having made this point, I must say that Palmyra does a fantastic job with their lamb shawarma. The meat was tender and flavorful and sliced into thin pieces which seemed to melt in my mouth. Can you tell how surprised I am about how much I enjoyed the lamb? It was truly, truly fantastic!   I think Palmyra also does a great job with their hummus - I typically like my hummus (or any dip, really) a little sour, and Palmyra's hummus was perfect! I was literally eating it by the spoonful (much to my mother's dismay).    The only thing I thought could use some improvement was the rice pilaf. It was a bit dry, but since it didn't particularly detract from the meal, I didn't factor it much into my review of this place.   Honestly, I am so excited for this restaurant's menu, and I can't wait to try all of the other different platters and wraps that they offer! I think I've found my go-to restaurant for this summer! :)"}
{"text":"We were really craving Medditerranian at maxwell street days and we're happy to find this place.  The owner who took our order was extremely nice and friendly.  About 20 minutes later, I got the chicken & hummus plate. This was the best thing we got, the chicken was delicious. However the photos showed veggies and I didn't receive any. 1 cucumber that's it. My partner received the lamb Kebob which was a tad dry. Like the pita bread, stale. The lamb Kebob was good but $12.99.  Very small lamb portion for that amount of money. Overall pretty decent but overpriced!"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was amazing. green potato curry mmmmm.... Even a few hours later, we were planning what we will have next time!! I'm in love"}
{"text":"New spot..ordered Tabouli to go, it had no lemon juice which is standard.disappointed & will overlook on next visit."}
{"text":"I'm sad to be downgrading my review for this place! I visited Palmyra again a few days ago, and the food was just not very good.  This time I ordered the Chicken Kebab Salad and my companions ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate and Gyro. My salad was beyond disappointing. The leaves were wilted and the tomatoes were mushy and tasted like they were on the verge of rotting. The whole thing was drenched in what would have been a really tasty dressing, had there been less of it. While the chicken kebab was delicious (well seasoned and perfectly grilled), there were only 6 small pieces of it on a mountain of greens and veggies. The Gyro was apparently not even close to how good it was last time, and they changed the bread they wrap it in, which was a downgrade. It seemed like the Shawarma plate was pretty tasty, but hat also had very few pieces of beef on it.  On the upside, the service was a lot faster and better than before, but we were also the only diners at the restaurant.  Unfortunately, I don't think I will be back as there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Scrumptious! I had a \"lamb kebab\", and it was delicious! Finally, there is a good Mediterranean cuisine in Madison!"}
{"text":"At first I was a little hesitant about the place when I arrived at Palymyra. My fiance and I didn't receive much of a greeting from the person taking our order and the pictures on the menu looked a bit outdated. However, I decided to put my doubts aside and give the place a try. I'm glad I did.  I got the falafel sandwich (which is actually a wrap) and my fiance got the chicken shawarma plate. My wrap came with a side of fries, his plate with hummus and salad. Since it was a nice day out, we went outside to eat on State Street. It didn't take long for our food to be brought out to us. I was very impressed with the presentation of the shawarma plate - they made it look much more appetizing than their menu did. The taste was pretty on point too. Garlic sauce would have been a great finishing touch on the chicken, but it was still good without it. The falafel was decent and had fresh tomatoes in it, but again, garlic sauce would have made it even better.  I would definitely come here again as long as it's nice enough to sit outside. I think aspect was what really made it a nice meal. If they gave this place a bit of a face lift to make it more modern, I think I would have given it a 5/5."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and the entire experience made me kick myself that we didn't go to the Banzo food cart!  When in doubt, just go to Banzo friends.    After hearing about Palmyra, our group of four were very eager to give this place a try.  We ordered four dishes, Fatoush salad, falafel salad, chicken schwarma and potato curry.  The food arrived very late, the food was cold and just not that great.  The pita was really cold.  Ick.  My friend was accosted as he walked into the bathroom by an employee and after he already confirmed he was a customer, he was asked to prove his table number if he wanted to use the bathroom.  I totally get you might get wanderers in from State St. to use the bathroom but pay attention and don't get them confused with customers!    Nope, not coming back."}
{"text":"Walking back to my house from State St and I decided to stop into Palmyra for some to go dinner. I got the Lamb Kebob which was seasoned and delicious. The dish was mostly rice although it was cooked perfectly. Some more lamb for $12 price would have been a better deal. Despite the lack of lamb, it was still a lot of food. In addition to the lamb and rice you get hummus, 4 pieces of fresh pita, and a small side salad. The hummus had a great consistency and mixed with the rice very well. Throw it all in a pita and its a perfect blend.   If you are in the mood for Mediterranean, this is definitely the stop for quality, quick food."}
{"text":"Big portions of food! I like their hummus, and all the kabob are so good! The food comes out slow though, so be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since early summertime, but there's usually a bit of wait for the food, so don't expect to run in and out with a to-go box. Be prepared to wait. I always get the chicken shawarma, and I'm never disappointed. I did order the kibbeh once. I'ts not made like the kibbeh I'm familiar with. Instead of having a meat/bulghur shell it had a light dough type fried shell. Not sure what country this variety of kibbeh derives from but I don't care for it. Anyway,let's talk about the shawarma. It's not dry, nor bland. It's everything I like. Chicken is juicy and seasoned well. There's plenty of yummy sauce and added toppings. The bread is nicely warmed and slightly crisped, wrapping all the delectable filling cozily inside. Yum! I hope this place catches on and they stick around, because there's more on the menu I have yet to try out."}
{"text":"Yikes, looks like I might have to try this place again when they're not as busy based on the other raving reviews.  If you're willing to put up with slow service and a lackluster atmosphere (aka, just get takeout), the food from this place is absolutely amazing.  We went here over the holiday weekend and were excited to grab a spot outside, which was difficult because even though half the tables didn't have patrons, they still had dirty dishes on them. As it turned out, it started to rain during our 20 minute wait for our food, so we moved inside. Once inside, it was difficult to hear each other because of how loud it was.  BUT, once the food came, the place redeemed all 3 stars back and all was right in the world again.  I got the sampler plate with grape leaves, hummus, and a salad. I also split a babaganoush plate with my friend. He got the chicken schwarma and said that too was quite good.  I would highly recommended this place for takeout if you're able to stop by during their strange schedule of open hours.  Also, be careful, CASH ONLY. No waiter service. No alcohol. Even more reasons to go with takeout."}
{"text":"I can only given them 3 stars because I ordered the lamb kabab and got beef otherwise the food was great. I really had a taste for lamb bad, and ordered takeout, so I couldn't take it back. NOW I will say the beef was out of this world. Very tender, no fat what so ever and the flavor very beefy. The beef reminded me of filet. I had the #4 lamb kababs (beef) and the #20 Baba-ghanouj. The portions were good. I am full after my meal and had trouble finishing the last 1/4 cup of Baba-ghanouj. I did get I think 2 full pita breads. I could have used a half of 1 more with the amount of Baba-ghanouj I got, it seemed like a lot. The dressing for the garden side salad was a caesar type and very good. Everything was salty enough and very garlicky. Very delicious. Took about 10-15 mins. to get my food. I will go back. I can't wait to try the falafel plate. And they deliver through https://www.mrdelivery.com/how-it-works"}
{"text":"I came to this review to update mine! Last week, I got another chance to visit this place and I loved it! Try their Lamb Kabob/kebab, you won't get disappointed!  Overall their price is affordable, the restaurant is clean and spacious but you have to be patient for the wait time! It's all worth-waiting though."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and still no food.  Place is very disorganized and no liquor license to ease the pain.  If you sit outside, you have to go in and pay up front."}
{"text":"NOTE: On the display menu the sandwiches are mentioned in the right most corner with prices. I wish I had noticed it before I ordered.  \"The best chicken I ever had in Madison so far\" - my fiancé The best potato curry, the best and fresh pita bread I've had ever so far (not just in Madison!) Their Tzatziki was yumm!! Most places that I've eaten the yogurt was sour but this place has the best Tzatziki. I don't know how they would usually serve pita for individual orders but they gave us a set of small pitas for all the orders together and it was very much sufficient.  Now for the list of items we ordered: Falafel plate - 4.5 - the falafel was fresh but I felt it was lacking something. Other than that yummy salad, yummy hummus and the yummmmmy pita. Potato curry plate - 5 - not a single morsel on the plate was left out!! My fiancé loved both the chicken kebab and chicken shawarma. 5 for both!  Service: I'll give a 4. The staff was friendly but didn't mention the difference between a plate and a sandwich when we were ordering four items. We could have saved $12 if we knew the difference. Again, it's not entirely their fault because I just thought the sandwich came with the fries at the same price.   Price: reasonable (only make sure you order what you want - the plate (full price) or the sandwich (almost half the price))  And, I took the falafel home and it was fresh even the next day. Overall, a place we will visit again and again and again. And I will try their tea and baklava the next time I am there."}
{"text":"I probably would have given this restaurant four stars out of five, but the service is really what kills it here and I hope they can improve it soon before it's too late. It had been my first time here a few weeks ago as my wife and I were looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant around Madison and amazingly the Yelp reviews were pretty good. We ended up going and of course most Yelpers claimed that it was more fast-food than anything and I thought it was an interesting concept at the time..... Well needless to say the music was extremely loud as we were ordering and I could barely hear the cashier, therefore because of that our option was to sit outside in order to have a conversation without going deaf. Secondly, the wait is atrocious as it took approximately 30 minutes to get our food and that was between two people (The restaurant wasn't even full either).  As others have said I would recommend this if you are getting take out or having it delivered (via a 3rd party delivery company). I was about to go back in for a second shot a week ago and when I walked in the same two people were working, one as a cashier and one as a cook. I immediately walked out even though the place was empty as it makes me wonder if those are the only two people who own it or work there daily..... As far as the food is concerned I feel they give you a large portion for the $10-$12 you will be spending with a drink, which has free self-serve refills (expect to refill a lot while you wait). Also, if your a humus fan then expect to have half your plate filled with humus..."}
