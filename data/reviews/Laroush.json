{"text":"After watching the man make my wrap I noticed that he not only kept his gloves on when handling the food and the money, but his thumb was protruding through the torn glove.  I was so horrified I couldn't eat my meal.  It was unfortunate because I found the food to be tasty.  Sanitation - thumbs down."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely fantastic visit!  The service was very personal and had a small business feel.  They charged me only 50Â¢ to add eggplant to a $5 falafel. They are very educated in vegan cuisine, even though the menu isn't labeled for vegan, vegetarian, etc. They offered me a free sample of their smoothie. All the food looked ripe and well treated! I will enjoy my meal, now!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams (or should I say, \"murmurs\") tranquility; from the fact that it's located far from the bustling inner streets of downtown Kent, to the calming personality of the lady that took my order, and to the lack of loud, blaring music that seems to permeate every other restaurant and shop in downtown Kent.  Anyway, Laroush specializes in smoothies and Mediterranean food, so expect tasty drinks, falafels, pitas and hummus. The prices are very affordable, in my opinion. Smoothies $4, pita wraps $5-7. Their platters range $8-10.  I only got a smoothie since I had just eaten, and... well, it was good! It was the \"guava mia\" which is guava and banana. It reminded me of the smoothies I'd have back on vacations in Hawaii as a child... ahh... well, nostalgia aside it was wonderful. Also, because this was my first time coming here the lady behind the counter gave me a small sampling of their hummus and chips. Now, normally I eschew these two things because in the past they didn't leave much of an impression on me, but I will admit that these were good enough that I'd actually purchase some in the future.  I'll definitely be coming back in the future. I hope one of the comments I read here about the sanitation issue (ignored hole in the thumb of the gloves a food worker was using) was a one-time incident, otherwise that really would be unfortunate.  You'll have to take this review with a grain of salt, though, because I haven't actually tried any of their entrees. I mean, smoothies taste awesome but it's difficult to get them wrong. However, I love the atmosphere, food selection, and pricing. Seating is scarce but given Laroush is situated off the beaten path and that Kent offers ample outdoor seating, I don't see this as a main issue.  Again, I want to emphasize how refreshing Laroush is from the noisy, lurid and burgeoning bar-scape downtown Kent has rapidly been transforming into."}
{"text":"Great place, only wish it was a little bigger so people could enjoy their meals there. I really enjoy their wraps, the platters are nice as well. The meat is all organic, which is definitely a plus! The hummus and baba ganoush are both very enjoyable. Haven't been able to try the grape leaves yet since I always go late, their out of them. I'm not disappointed by this because I think it's awesome their make them fresh everyday so they don't get mushy. The owner at Laroush is very friendly and welcoming. Since i always come late, he said he's going to save some for me next time I come.  It's a small hole in the wall type of place, worth a visit. Very healthy food and the prices are pretty cheap. I go here often for the hummus and the smoothies. Try the mango smoothie, its amazing!  Overall, good place to stop in and check out!"}
{"text":"I was one of the first customers of Laroush when it opened. I took a hiatus for a bit, and now I am getting back into them. I would say that they have stabilized since the earlier days, which is a good thing. And the owner still recognizes me, I believe.  As Mediterranean food goes, this is the Middle Eastern version (whether the differences are noticeable probably depends on who you are talking to!). I mention this to point out that I have noticed the Middle Eastern community is frequenting Laroush. Usually that sort of thing is a good sign. I read somewhere that the meat is halal, which is probably a factor in their patronage, though certainly not the only one.  I am very pleased to see that they have added seating (for about 9 people), which is a huge plus for me to be able to eat the food as fresh as possible. I had the veggie platter ('cause I'm a vegetarian), and it was great. Solid falafel, traditional hummus... the rice was tasty, the stuffed grape leaves were satisfying, and the salad was a spinach base (atypical and much welcomed). I wasn't able to try the baba ganoush because the owner had trouble locating eggplants that day. Can we say, fresh food? If you are at all inclined, get the smoothie. Made from 7 different fruits, it is a tasty time.  So why didn't I give Laroush 5 stars? Well, I just don't give out perfect scores willy-nilly. You have to do something incredible to earn 5 from me. Laroush may not of achieved that, but they are darn good people, with darn good food."}
{"text":"This place says it is open set hours, but never is. The food is pretty good, although more expensive, and staff is friendly. They just get low marks for prices being higher, inconsistent hours, and not the best food. You are better off going to Troy Grill around the corner."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but it disappointed on a few fronts. The closed sign was still up at 11:35am when all the signs say open at 11, once inside the very nice guy took my order and then it took him a half hour to make two platters and a small falafel - for my to go order . Oh and those falafel were a disappointment, they may have been homemade, but they were reheated in the microwave. (I LOVE falafel, so I was sad.) The rest of the food was pretty good. Overall a good choice if you want healthy food, but not fast (at least not today)."}
{"text":"Please open up again!! Their food was so delicious and healthy. I'm so bummed that they're closed now. Everyone keep your fingers crossed that the owners will come back and reopen Laroush!!!!"}
{"text":"If you gave me the choice of any place to eat food in the Akron-Kent area, I would choose Laroush every time. Their food is simply the best, and you can't beat the prices. The staff is so friendly and the food is authentic and delicious to the max!  I have tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to be let down by anything. The only down side is that it isn't necessarily fast food. The wait can be a little bit of a drag, but there's always the option to call ahead and place an order. If you're looking for food to go, that's definitely the way to do it. The quality and taste of the food they serve more than compensates for the wait, though, in my opinion."}
