{"text":"Ordered from OrderIt.ca. Food arrived within 40 minutes of order. Made our own rice and ordered two apps and three mains. Everything was to die for. Rich, just the right amount of spice, perfect temperature. Everything was just what the doctor ordered. Even swayed a sceptic who was weary of Indian food. Will for sure order again. (a bit on the pricey side though)."}
{"text":"I have been a somewhat regular customer of Butter Chicken Factory for a year or so - I only order occasionally as I'm near the outer edge of their delivery area and naturally it takes a while to get here. Nobody's fault, it just takes time. Recently there was an issue with my order and I decided to finally give feedback via the survey email they send when you order from their site. As a quick aside, their site has a pretty simple ordering system and they give you 10% off for using it versus Uber or Justeat.  Less than 15 minutes after I sent in my survey, the owner of the restaurant called me personally to apologize and make it right. I was blown away by his sincerity and commitment to not just making things right with me but making sure the issue would not occur in the future. The delivery driver expressed an equal level of concern the next time he came by, and has always been nice and polite with me despite other reports here on Yelp.   My wife and I are going to buy bigger pants and double down on our orders from this place. The food itself is fantastic - very rich flavours & large portions. As for the butter chicken itself: Spicy packs a great punch without completely overpowering the flavour but most people will want medium. I know this reads like a shill but I'm just a human being who's thrilled to get some consistent food service, you know? Sure, the delivery takes a while but that's my problem for not living closer. Fact is, this factory makes some damn fine butter chicken, palak paneer, aloo gobi, pulao rice, you name it - it's delicious food that can satisfy any appetite. Don't forget to ask for the chutney!"}
{"text":"Ordered online for 5 of us, took 45 minutes MORE than the estimated time. The butter chicken was far too sweet compared to anything else I've had. For a place that has butter chicken in their name I found that very disappointing. I tried the chicken vindaloo and that was way better. The garlic naan was ok. The rice was not bad."}
{"text":"This place is only a few blocks up from our office. We placed a carry-out order for 5 orders at 12:20pm & they advised it would be an hour. After 75 minutes we called to check the status and we hung up on when asking if the driver had left yet. We called back hoping it was just an accident and were also requesting a discount because it was very inconvenient and messing up our office schedule. We were once again hung up on. Now when we call from any phone (office or personal cell phones) its going directly to voice mail. Its now 2:15pm, nearly 2 hours later and still no idea where our food is and we're considering it a loss. Their food has been good in the past. But now, the Butter Chicken Factory is dead to us."}
{"text":"I swung by here on a whim the other day and tried out the Butter Chicken and their Biryani. Both just fantastic! Highly recommend this place to folks living in the area."}
{"text":"After eating here, more than 7 times, It really hurts to gives this such a low score. Unfortunetly, their bad service (see other comments) is turning into terrible service.   After a long wait, they will insist something is 'just coming out' of the kitchen then disappear for 10 minutes. And take out, don't get me started they don't even pretend to listen to spice levels or give reasonable pickup time estimates. If you order one thing mild and one thing spicey, they get it wrong almost every time.  Their food is pretty good and I really like the vegatable curry but the constantly 'lying' staff makes this a no-go restaurant."}
{"text":"I want to give BCF a higher rating because their food has no issues at all and you are always guaranteed a delicious meal.  Their service on the other hand is sub-par and average at best with their customer service. My first time ordering, I called in a fairly large order only to be criticized over the phone that I had 'ordered it in the wrong order' which I was not aware of.  Upon arriving slightly early to pick my order up, I walked in to pay and then ask how much time is remaining only to be told that 'I was told it would be 20 minutes' even before I could take my money out.  If they would just ease up on their attitude and realize people are just trying to 1. order and 2. pay them - both of which require no bad attitude from the restaurant.  Food's great though..."}
{"text":"This is my go-to delivery in the area. The chicken tikka masala is great. I also like some of their paneer dishes. The rice and naan are good as well.   (no charge for delivery, and 10% off if you order online. which is great)"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss; It's expensive and the quality of the food (I got tonight) is poor, as a matter of fact it's total crap... I'm betting there are some cooks who are stellar and the other(S) are buss boys who think they can cook...  Sorry lads... your just wasting space in my neighbourhood... The sooner your broke and out of business the better off we all will be...  Update...  The burnt offerings were replaced by the Owner... Thank You."}
{"text":"Order took over 1hr 50 mins to be delivered. Food was cold and flavourless. No apology offered for such poor service and poor quality."}
{"text":"Just fantastic! This has to be the best Indian food in the city hands! The creaminess of the butter chicken, the tangy Tikka Masala, the pull of the warm naan bread. A-MAZ-ING!!!!!!!  Always consistent, I'm never disappointed with this place. I will agree the service needs to improve, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I went there with my mother to enjoy a nice, Indian dinner, since we both like Indian food.   Unfortunately, the service was horrible, and the food didn't really meet our expectations.     There was only 4 other people there, so there was no excuse for the lackluster service.  The waiter, who was drying glasses, and the owner (I think) took about 5 mins to bring us the menus, another 5 for water.  Even with this poor indication of service, we decided to give it chance to try the food.    The food itself was ok.  Nothing special, especially considering the poor service.  The titular butter chicken was lacking in flavour, and didn't have that much chicken.  There is another Indian place (Rashnaa) that is far better that is almost across the street, for about the same price.    Considering all the other Indian places around here, this place isnt worth more than a glance.  Do yourself a favour and check out one of the other places instead."}
{"text":"We really like the flavors of the dishes here compared to other indian restaurants around the city...and the prices are pretty good (you get large quantities and will have left overs for sure).  I would eat hear a lot more often if not for the amount of oil they put in the food.  The okra was swimming in oil, it is a bit ridiculous.  The chicken tikka was good but also pretty sweet (usually we opt for tikka over butter chicken because it tends to have less sugar and cream).  I will say the biryani here is really good and they use chicken breast in a lot of their chicken dishes which is a plus... but we can only eat here once or twice a year for the sake of our health!!! I hope they come up with healthier versions of their dishes...then i would recommend them to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This was a mixed experience. The waiter was like a zombie. I want with my girl and we were alone in the restaurant, only accompanied by a fly at our table. The food was not great and the portions weren't great.   The food tasted fine but it took a long time to arrive considering we were alone in the restaurant at dinner time. I was not impressed and for the price of the dishes I think that better can be experienced eslewhere  Highly unrecommended."}
{"text":"If you have any judgements based on the name of this restaurant, set them aside and try it out. It was a happy surprise! The menu is standard Indian fare but the food is a cut above. Serving staff was prompt and charming and they were doing a booming business this Friday night. Our fave was the eggplant bharta, which was rich and smoky. The Naan was feather light and springy in the mouth. What a feast!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from BCF after reading favorable reviews from this site.  The butter chicken (breast) was delicately spiced, with sweet, rich sauce.   The rice pullao with peas was very flavourful.  The eggplant bharta had interesting blend of flavour; lots of tomatoes and onions. Eggplant is not a favourite of mine but this dish was quite enjoyable.   My favorite Indian restaurant is still Babur at Queen St. but it would be worthwhile to try other dishes at BCF.  Skip the greasy samosas though.  Low marks though for delivery service. I was told that delivery will take 1 hour but we ended up waiting for 2 hours."}
{"text":"Timothy's Tikka House was better. These guys would not even deliver a single meal order around the corner. Even after adding an app and maybe naan I was a dollar or two shy of their minimum, and they still would not. TTH I could order a dish and rice and get a delivery. Speaking of the rice, the portion is so tiny they serve, you need two to accompany a meal. The food was ok, but that's about it. In a competitive city like Toronto, they need to step up their game."}
{"text":"I ate there today during the Cabbagetown Festival  the butter chicken was delicious and the samosas were the best I have ever had it all tasted like real homemade  the staff look like real hardworking people who are sincere"}
{"text":"There is dope Indian food here. Seafood vindaloo's my personal favourite, but the biryani is sick too."}
{"text":"Wonderful renovation with new tables and art work throughout.  Excellent caring staff with exceptional Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"Okay so four of us went and tried their butter chicken and a whole cut up tandoori chicken. We also ordered eight naans and two mango lasees. The price came up to about $60 for everything. The butter chicken was the worst I have ever had. It tasted sweet and tasted nothing like the rich, tangy and spicy flavor I'm used to. It also seemed like it was reheated so it was kind of clammy. The tandoori chicken was tough to bite into and again seemed like it was reheated and left over chicken from earlier. This is not the service I expected and for the price I paid, I didn't expect to be served this. I have ate at cheaper spots that had better food such as tikka house and shaheens tikka and kabaab house (on gateway and grenoble drive). If you want indian food, do some research and avoid this spot."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed in the variety of choices for the lunch buffet. There was only 4 choices. 2 were vegetarian. As hungry as we were... we had no choice. I was really looking forward in trying their lunch buffet. I wish there was more options. But service was amazing and the Naan bread was nice and warm!"}
{"text":"Nobody else in the place for an early dinner. Took a while to get the tea that we ordered and the naan came well after the main dishes arrived. The food itself, however, was excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this spot on the weekend with some friends. Defiantly a cute little restaurant with a cozy vibe. The butter chicken was hands down the best I've tasted in a while. The menu selection was great. The staff and service was great! The only thing that I would suggest for this restaurant to fix is having cleaner washrooms."}
{"text":"Probably the best tasting Indian takeout food  I've had so far. Unfortunately delivery time was a little too long. That being said the food was exceptional so will definitely give it another chance. If they fail again on delivery I will go there and either pickup or eat in."}
{"text":"Where do I start... BUTTER CHICKEN. For a place named after this item it is absolutely HORRIBLE. it is so sweet it's almost inedible. 8 pieces of chicken swimming in tomato sugar sauce. DELIVERY. Took 45 min longer than promised delivery time; even after two calls.  SAAG PANEER. bad. What does $1.99 but you? 1 piece of naan. Waste of time and money. Second time with them, never again. Save yourself the time and money"}
{"text":"This is being written to describe the disrespectful, rude, and racist delivery service we received a few days ago for our order at Butter Chicken Factory. First and foremost, I am a regular customer at your restaurant as I have ordered a few times before, and have experienced long delivery wait times of around 1.5-2 hours. Therefore, as the customer and having little knowledge of how your delivery timing works, I assumed it was okay to head out for 20 minutes or so to run an errand before my food got delivered. Out of utmost surprise, the order arrived early and I received a call from the delivery guy, who by the way had a rude communication approach right off the bat. Saying he has been knocking on the door for past 5 mins when literally the time I left and started walking away was 5 mins, so that was a lie. He said that if I dont come in the next min, I will have to come pick up at the store. So my friend and I started to jog back and took us 2 mins to get back to the condo. He was waiting for us by the concierge, conversing...we didn't think anything of this until later. It was just a shock to me because despite the late service I received in the past, I did not complain or talk rudely to the delivery guy, so I clearly expected the same in return. We paid the man the full total, and proceeded towards the elevator to put our food away in the unit. He purposely spoke loudly with the concierge so that we would be able to hear him and said something along the lines of 'Those two girls are Indians and never tip me every time I come'. 'They just take there food and run' 'these type of people a waste'.  Firstly, although a tip is expected from the customer, it is NOT necessary and I strongly believe one should not have to feel insulted due to the absence of a tip. Referring to us as 'indians' when we are in fact Christian and stereotyping us into an apparent 'category' showed nothing but lack of respect and maturity. I do not, in any way, feel comfortable with this man delivering to my condo again, and speaking to my concierge rudely about my friend and I  in a racist manner. I unnecessarily felt violated and targeted in my own home and personal space. This horrible and unfavorable customer service only added mental anguish to our evening, and suppressed our appetite for the remainder of the evening. It was not only a waste of time, but also money as we feel our money could have been invested in a more respectful restaurant.   How can one own an \"Indian\" food restaurant and go as far as bashing the \"Indian\" people that order from them. Being in the hospitality and customer service industry, one should know how to treat there customers but being RACIST over a tip in this time and era is utterly ridiculous. It's 2017 and its time to grow up. If a tip is so significant to this restaurant then maybe adding plastic forks, spoons or napkins to the orders is a start to actually being worthy of a tip. Surprisingly, I actually like the curries here and ordered several times and didn't complain about the late deliveries, burnt naan and the aloo tikki that had a tablespoon of yogurt on it and so utterly dry. I looked passed these things...  However, I am a 20 year old female and to be bad mouthed by an older man in about his late 40s is disgusting. I can be his daughter or younger sister for that fact and being independent women,  I will not tolerate this type of harassment from anyone. I hope there management fires there delivery man and train there present/future staff basic customer skills. He will ruin there business for what it is right now!"}
{"text":"Loved their butter chicken!! fantastic sauce, juicy white meat, just perfect with their delicious rice, it was really fantastic. Sadly I have not tried anything else here so all I can comment on is the butter chicken, which again was delicious!! Naan was also good but small, and if I was to complain about anything, it would be that there could have been more chicken, there was easily 3x more sauce than the chicken..."}
{"text":"The quality of food was pretty good. I liked the tikka masala more than the butter chicken.  Large portions. Dinner for 2, was good for three people.  The service was good, and the servers were really nice. The lights were too dim, and ambiance a bit weird."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from the Butter Chicken Factory tonight for the first time. Being new to the area I am searching for my regular butter chicken spot.   I think I have found it at the Butter Chicken Factory. After having a really bad experience at the nearby Rashnaa Indian Restaurant I was eager to see if the quality was better from the Butter Chicken Factory.   My order was promptly delivered within 30 mins of ordering. I had;    2 orders of butter chicken  1 chicken masala   2 rice  2 garlic nann   Bill came to 58$ with free delivery $65 with tip. A little on the steep side.   The quality of the food was good. It was hot and flavorful. I was impressed with the creaminess and authentic taste of the butter chicken and the spice of the masala.   My only complaint is we only received 4 pieces of Naan in 2 orders and only one rice even though we had ordered too.   We called back and they sent more rice and naan without charge.   I will definitely be getting takeout from this place again."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special.  Was a really great way to have a bit of everythinf for lunch.  It came with butter chicken, a chic pea spicy dish (favourite), a minced lamb dish, a salad and a dessert.  With a side of naan.  It at first looks to small but it turned out to be just right.  Enjoy the lunch by the window so you can see the wonderfully colourful (weird) people outside.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I have ordered several times since my last review and the food and service is consistently excellent.   The butter chicken is excellent.  The lamb/goat is great quality meat but the reason I continue to order is because the curries/sauces are amazing and so flavourful, and there are many to choose from  I am trying to taste everything on the menu which is hard because I keep ordering my favourite dishes   Service and delivery have always been excellent, friendly and on time"}
{"text":"How can a place called \"Butter Chicken Factory\" make such terrible butter chicken?  It's just so bland.  Every attempt I've made at making this dish has turned out better than this stuff.  This is grocery store jar butter chicken."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place - well-prepared, satisfying food, and the prices, while a bit high, are appropriate for the level of quality. What prevents me from giving this place a higher rating is that it doesn't really stand out from other Indian places - it's solid, but not more than that. The service was spotty as well - slower than molasses than January, to put it mildly. My friend and I were the only 2 people in the joint, and it took 15 min. for us to be served, and almost an hour for the food. They also were really unprepared; we went early for a Saturday night (6pm), and no one was there, but by 8pm the place was packed, and they only had one server. The server also was very insistent than we pay with cash, because he needed change. Whoops.  Overall, I'd probably go back there, but I think the place only does well because Rashnaa's is going downhill, and they're far away from Queen St. or other areas with better Indian places."}
{"text":"It is a small place... Prices are not too highly not too low ... I don't eat Indian a lot  so I can't judge much... I had butter chicken and i didn't like it a lot . Customer service was good ... In general it OK"}
{"text":"Flavourful meals and generous portions at reasonable prices! I've enjoyed all the veggie dishes that I've tried so far and always end up having enough leftovers for another meal. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I just ordered some lentils from them - got it delivered and they had STONES in it. Due to which two of my teeth actually chipped off at the edges. YES Thats how large the stones were. I called them to ask for compensation for my dental bill to fix the tooth because I am a student and they could NOT care less, the manager was EXTREMELY rude and actually had the nerve to offer me \"more lentils\" as a compensation. I even offered to bring proof with the original lentil box AND the stones but apparently he could not be bothered with such 'trivial' matters. If you want to save a tooth or two NEVER order from here again! I would give this place a ZERO star but one was the minimum."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I have been to.  Not the best on a dish per dish comparison, but just a pleasant mix of friendly and quick service, quality and quantity of food, at great prices.  We were a gang of about 10 people and ordered about 12 different dishes with a bunch of rice, naan, along with some appetizers, drinks and dessert, and the bill was only 25$ each including tip."}
{"text":"i told you so.  i really like the food here but damn if it isn't hard to get some customer service from the management.  this is my 3rd time eating in. me and my son each like the butter chicken, server was nice. portions great.  and there is the rub. we always have lots to take home. the first time we got home with a disaster in the take out bag. crummy cheap styrofoam takeout container leaked sauce everywhere. tossed the works. a shame.  the next visit i asked to take the remains in their excellent closed plastic takeout containers. no problem. i appreciated it.  tonight when the nice server came out with styrofoam i explained i would like the takeout containers and why. he went back cheerily and then returned embarrassed. boss said no. too precious his containers. preciousssss. can i pay him 50 cents for precious? nope.  so we very carefully brought the cherished leftovers home and no matter how careful folks you end up with a sloppy mess.  yes that's gd right. i told you so."}
{"text":"This place is in the corner and I drive by here all the time on the way home as I come off the DVP. My girlfriends and I decided to give this place a try on Wednesday after work when we missed the meeting time for the ROM Walk that was available in the area that day. This place is a very small restaurant. They only have one big round table to accommodate a bigger party. I think that this place if you plan on coming with your friends, 4 people would be a max.   I ordered the Chicken Saag and an order of the garlic naan. My girlfriends each ordered an order of the garlic naan too with their meal. One of my friend ordered the lamb chops and my other friend ordered a vegetarian curry dish. I really enjoyed my dish, the chicken saag had spinach in it. The flavors were really good, it had just the right amount of spices for my taste buds. The garlic naan was good too - I could of kept eating my chicken saag with naan, if my stomach was able to house more food in one seating.   The service at this restaurant was good. The server (there is only one) was friendly and attentive. The menu prices, I thought was reasonable for the portion size and the quality of the food. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. I think next time I am here, I am going to try their butter chicken dish."}
{"text":"We drove by and wanted to give it a try with it's intriguing name.  Ordered take it-butter chicken and two pieces of naan.   The butter chicken was tasty BUT for $14 in a small take out container I would expect more than four small bite size pieces of chicken.  The naan was very good and not burnt.  My rating is based on value for dinner.  I will try it next time for lunch where it looks like many yelpers gave it better reviews."}
{"text":"I was a little wary of this place upon walking in, but by the time I left, stuffed to the gills and with a happy tummy, I knew I had to be back. Yes, the Butter Chicken is fabulous. How could it not be -- the place is called BUTTER CHICKEN FACTORY! However, although it's similarly rich to other butter chicken dishes you've tried, the version at Butter Chicken factory is more tomatoey and tangy. It's also a little more bland than other Butter Chickens I've tried. But the chicken is super tender, and you can get it in multiple ways: bone in or boneless, white meat or leg.   The biggest standout, though, was the Tandoori Chicken. Maybe they should call this place the Tandoori Chicken Factory, because it was one of the most juiciest, meatiest, and largest portions I've ever gotten at an Indian restaurant.   There were some things about Butter Chicken Factory that were a little off, though: there was a very VERY strong perfumey/incense smell that knocked me off my feet a little when I first walked in. To be honest, I almost wanted to walk about after that (but I'm glad I stayed). Also, my soda (pop, if you're Canadian!) didn't come with ice; they told us they didn't have any when we asked for some. That's a little weird. This obnoxious American needs her ice! ;D  But other than that, everything else was perfect. The people there were super friendly and nice, too. The menu has lots of options for combination meals to be split between parties of 2+, and apparently their lunchtime thalis can't be beat.   I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian cuisine. Chicken Biryani was fabulous and the butter lamb was...BUTTA!  Staff and atmosphere, outstanding. Done let the surrounding area detour you.   A diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Not happy with Butter Factory Chicken. Ordered at 8:07pm and the order didn't arrive until 10:07pm The drivers excuse was I didn't come down at the ground floor and the buzzer wasn't working. I gave him a look and my husband pointed my cell phone on the bill and asked why he didn't call. We specifically instructed our buzzer is broken and to call us. The driver just handed my order and I didn't bother giving him a tip. As he walked away with an glare, he instead responded back by giving me a middle finger."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.. they serve the BEST butter chicken I've ever had, and I've had A LOT of butter chicken! Generous portion size and a nice atmosphere too. Make sure you visit this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I can only assume from the blandness of the food that anyone giving this restaurant a high rating has been on a steady diet of over-cooked meat and boiled potatoes for the entirety of their lives. Also, I dare you to tell the difference between their butter chicken sauce and luke warm ketchup. The Sang Paneer was fine, but only after a liberal application of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday with friends. Nice small place. Very nice decor. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. One of the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to. The food was full of flavour and very satisfying. The butter chicken was delicious. The seafood vindaloo and the Goan fish curry was one of the best Indian meals I've ever had. It was absolutely perfect. The portions were very generous. I took home leftovers and enjoy it for dinner today. Soo delicious. I want to order it again."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 vegan dishes -- Daal tarka, bharta, aloo ghobi. the portions were overflowing their containers and the food was med-hot when I had ordered mild.   daal was very nicely flavoured, in fact all dishes were. the problem came with the huge amount of grease used: there was 1\" of oil sitting on top of the daal; there's no reason daal should have this much oil. it shouldn't even be noticeable. the bharta was also super oily.   the oil leaked out of delivery containers before we opened them, needing 7 paper towels and scrubbing the table with soap to get it off.  we then skimmed the dishes for excess oil and collected about ¾ cup.   this was disgusting, messy, unhealthy and completely unnecessary.   this was my 8th Indian delivery from Just Eat, and I prefer Aroma, Bombay Street Food or Bindia, though BCF would be up there if they cut the grease."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked past this restaurant and there was no one eating at that time (2pm and they closed at 3pm). I checked Yelp, the reviews were not great but we decided to try it anyway, I mean why not? We ordered Butter Goat, Vindaloo Goat, Roganjosh Goat, roti and naan. The Butter and Roganjosh were delicious but we weren't a huge fan of Vindaloo (not that it's bad it's just not our cup of tea - it has a strong kick and if someone likes it, go ahead). I personally like the naan better than the roti but one like the roti better than the naan. The server was friendly and I would totally come back for some curry!"}
{"text":"#TORONTO #CABBAGETOWN #BUTTERCHICKEN #YELP #INDIAN  Given their name, I always thought they'd have more than one type of butter chicken (Bombay's orangish butter chicken, Delhi's reddish butter chicken, Whitewashed butter chicken, etc.). Sadly, they only have one type, of a deep orange color, not quite red. As mentioned in my reviews about Indian places, butter chicken (the right kind) needs to be red.   That said, however, Butter Chicken Factory did not disappoint. Their butter chicken was better than most places I've tried. The portions were bigger than the usual - can easily feed three-four people. So guess what happened when each got ordered our own bowl of butter chicken? I ate mine over three days.   Ankie Tip: It tastes YUMMY the day after, and cold, right out of the fridge.   We ordered in, so I can't write much about the restaurant. The delivery was a few minutes late. No biggie."}
{"text":"Brought an out-of-town relative here for lunch as we both love Indian food and we were in the neighbourhood. While the food was good, it was just ok...not spectacular. We both ordered the lunch special (which was $9.95) and it came with basmati rice, naan bread, butter chicken, a minced lamb dish, daal, a small salad and dessert (the honey ball). Lots of food to razzle dazzle, but not huge on flavour. The daal was fairly bland, rice just ok. I substituted butter chicken for the lamb ( for an additional $2) and it was a tad on the sweet side. It's a sad commentary when the hi-light of the meal was the naan. Server was friendly, although we had to remind him of our drink order when it wasn't brought out. Don't know if I'd go back....there's nothing special here."}
{"text":"Avitania's claim on eating the best butter chicken was true. It was so true that skipping out on my weekly Pilates class made it a perfect excuse. Instead of squeezing and neutralizing my core, I exercised my belly's muscles and satiated my happy emotions by eating yummy Indian food.   My BCF highlights included and a must order for others: - Tandoori Chicken - Channa masala - Lamb Vandaloo - Aloo Gobi  - Naan - Sweet dessert balls  My love for paneer remains unwavered and I just loved their crispy paneer appetizers. I think I had seconds of the creamy paneer curry.   The food wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be. However I do recall that we didn't specify to the kitchen that we wanted our food spicy, so they did us a favour by playing it safe.    My only disappointment: Butter Chicken Factory does not deliver in my area."}
{"text":"Have come here twice now and enjoyed both times. Neither time was busy which is a nice change from other restaurants downtown. I especially love the aloo papri chaat!"}
{"text":"Good deal on the lunch special. Taste is good and stomach is satisfied.Nice presentation and good service. Will be going back for more."}
{"text":"We had dinner here. My sister ordered Butter Chicken and find the taste too sweet. I had a Chicken Tikka Masala with Naan and it  was good and portions are large.   The place is a little small. Staff is friendly and checked on us often."}
{"text":"Great food, probably the best Indian food place in downtown Toronto. They can improve in customer service."}
{"text":"Yay!! Timothy's Tikka House closed...but has reopened as \"The Butter Chicken Factory\".  Not the greatest name, but the food is back! Same food as Timothy's, I swear...and that's just great!  They've increased their portion sizes, so prices appear to be steeper, but you get a bigger dish. This means, if ordering delivery, you might want to limit the number of dishes. I ordered my usual number and was shocked by the price...but once I saw the portion size, I understood the discrepancy.  I have not eaten \"in\" since the re-do, so can't speak to the decor.  But I am just tickled to see that my favourite Indian cuisine is back, and just as good as ever."}
{"text":"Really delicious food!  The best garlic naan I have ever had.  The service could be faster, so don't go if in a hurry.  Otherwise, a great place!"}
{"text":"We've dined in once and ordered delivery from here twice, and every single time has been a disaster because of their poor organisation. We waited forty minutes for a dish while dining in the first time we tried it. Tonight, we ordered delivery through http://just-eat.ca. I ordered at 8.30pm and was told the food would arrive at 9.20pm. It is now almost TEN pm, an hour and a half later, and we are still waiting for our dinner to show up. We called to ask where it is, and the guy on the phone offered nothing but excuses. The food would have to be damn good value to get that kind of a sour taste out of my mouth, but it's not even that. Dinner for two, with two curries, bread, and an appetiser, came to $45--pricy for what is basically an Indian take out joint. Never again!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and the service is abysmal. I wish the service was even slightly more tolerable, because the food was so good I would happily eat here again, and certainly warrants 4 or maybe even 5 stars, especially at the price point. I really enjoyed WHAT I ate but I did not enjoy eating here.  The good: - The food is excellent and the portions are large-ish.  The butter chicken is very, very good if a little bit too sweet and the Tikka Masala is also great, but Lahore's is better.  - The food is at a decent price point (2 meat mains, 2 Naans, rice = $39) - Good location (for me!) - Dining room was very clean, linen napkins, inoffensive decor, etc... it's sort of clean-bland  The bad: - It was impossible to get our waters refilled; I almost got up and took a pitcher off the counter - It took forever (and 2 asks) to get the bill - We thought we would make it easy on them and just split evenly on two cards but that was an impossible task for them to execute. It literally involved a scrap paper and a calculator and two employees. - We went to the takeout window to pay with credit card and the guy was MANUALLY TYPING our card numbers in. WTFITS? (what the f@%! is that s#!t, for the acronymally challenged) - It took longer for us to pay than to eat - They have taped off the window on the door into the kitchen. That just makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. What don't you want me to see going on back there? I already smell that your chefs aren't wearing deodorant when I walk past to get to the restrooms. I'm fine with it - it adds... authenticity? - The restrooms were clean but had no soap or toilet paper - Mike S. also commented that there was no soap in the mens room. Is there soap in the kitchen? I'm just not going to think about it. The food was still good.   - I told them their restrooms has no soap or toilet paper and the guy smiled and nodded. And then didn't refill the supply or bring the bill.  Overall, I will definitely eat here again.  I will probably call ahead, get take out, only pay with cash and not think about them not having soap in either of their restrooms."}
{"text":"Been there a few times now.  The butter chicken is too tangy for my taste, but if  you like a little sweetness you'll probably enjoy it.  The tandoori chicken is very good.  Definitely some of the best in town.    The flavors are different from other Indian restaurants.  The service wasn't bad when I went but it was also pretty quiet.  They also have a lunch tali for 10 bucks which I've been told is good."}
{"text":"Service 4.5/5 Value 5/5 Food 3.8/5  I popped in here yesterday with a friend to try out BCF's $9.99 lunch special. I went with the non-veggie option as I felt rather compelled to try their namesake dish. For the price, the lunch was a good sized portion. The naan wasn't spectacular, but it served its purpose. I thought the butter chicken was a wee bit on the generic side, but at least the chicken was tender. I did enjoy the channa the most. Our server was polite and attentive, and the small restaurant was comfortable. The food may not have wowed me, but it was still a pleasant lunch and well worth the $13 it cost."}
{"text":"Yep... 3 stars as the Yelp average score. I hopes it would be more as I live closeby, but I have to agree with 3.  Take out waiting time is 30 minutes, and when you arrive, you still have to wait 2-3 minutes for them to prepare the order (which was only butter chicken... shouldn't be much faster if this is a butter chicken factory?). First star loss.  The butter chicken is OK, although the sauce is a little bit too sugary, clearly, and the chicken pieces are regular chicken breast cut cubes. SO not cheap, not exceptional... Second start lost... total 3 stars..."}
{"text":"We don't eat Indian Cuisine often, but when we do, this is where we go! The Chicken Tikka Masala is delicous, especially paired with the Kaahmiru Pullao (rice). Delicious, flavourful and big portions."}
{"text":"My wife's sister lives in the adjacent neighborhood and the last time I was here the place was called Timothy's, now BCF.  We call ahead and Take Away.  The food has always been good and worth the walk."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I liked Timothys but this chef has improved on the flavour. The portions are much larger. Could actually get 3  meals from what I ordered. My new favourite place!  Service could be a bit quicker. The owner is very courteous and friendly...makes a difference."}
{"text":"Butter Chicken Factory hit all the right spots! I was looking to try the best butter chicken in Toronto and this was the first place, and I must say they've set the bar VERY VERY high. The location is great, right in Cabbagetown. The decor and seating is very intimate and lovely, don't be fooled by the outdated pictures posted on here. If you're a lover of Bollywood soundtracks, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Atif Aslam, this is the place for you to go eat! There's a wide variety of chicken, lamb, kebab dishes on the menu, naan and desserts as well. We were treated with pappar and some sweet and spicy chutney. We ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka, tandoori lamb chops, seekh kebabs, with tandoori roti, garlic and regular naan. The portions were great, and everything was beyond amazing! Ended the meal off with some gulab jamun that just hit my sweet tooth and gave me the itis. Butter Chicken Factory is a MUST GO!"}
{"text":"I don't often eat at \"factories\" but I thought I would give this place a shot. The Butter Chicken Factory (more of a restaurant really), is just south of Wellesley on the west side of Parliament street. This corner spot was formerly a Timothy's Tikka House, though I'm not sure what business a man named \"Timothy\" had with a Tikka House anyway. Good riddance.  BCF is fairly cosy inside, but pretty classy and clean. They managed our reservation for twelve by linking a large round table with a couple of four-tops. It worked, but any larger would be pushing it. The Bollywood pop in the background wasn't my favourite, but it beats the plinky-plunk piano music that usually fills joints like this. Beer options are the very typical Kingfisher and brewed-in-Canada-but-Indian Cheetah. They both suck. Don't bother.  As the sole brown diner in our group, I happily provided my menu consulting skills (for free). We calculated that eight dishes should suffice for our group of twelve, but our waiter suggested we try Dinners For Four (DFF); each gets you a selection of appetizers, five entrees, and your choice of rice or naan. It took a bit of haranguing (more than I would have liked, to be honest) to convince the staff that three DFFs (i.e., 12 dishes for 12 willing-to-share yelpers) was enough. Eventually we settled on two dinners for four with a promise to order more if hungry. (Seriously, it went down like this.)  The meal started off with some pretty decent apps. The pakoras were pretty good, and I really dug the potato samosas. A good traditional crust with a dusting of something salty, maybe garam masala. As for our mains we ordered two of their three offerings of butter chicken (boneless and bone-in), a goan fish curry, lamb vindaloo, malai kofta, daal tadka, aloo gobi, channa masala... holy moose it was a lot of food, and it came out fast. The standouts were the bone-in butter chicken (it's always better this way), the creamy malai kofta, and the flavourful lamb vindaloo. Though I could have handled everything a few notches spicier, there was a lot of flavour and nothing was too oily or rich.  At the behest of Avitania \"I want sweet balls in my mouth!\" B we ordered dessert. I got the ras malai (passable, but really thin), and the restaurant was kind enough to comp us some galub jamuns. Honestly: I've had better. These balls were small (tee hee) and a bit dry in the centre; not dripping with sweetness like they should be. But Hell, dessert wasn't anything that could derail a rock-solid dinner that left most of us stuffed to the gills. Group diners take note: 10 dishes feeds 12 and the damage worked out to only $30 per person.  An awesome addition to Cabbagetown.  Obligatory Title Pun: Make yourself KOFTA-ble at the BCF.  Menu Readability: Indian menus are usually way too long and unreadable. Theirs is well laid out.  Need to mention: The naan here is Off The Hook. It's crispy and thin and comes out untouchably hot. I really liked it.  What this place teaches me about myself: My people are not known for their beer-making skills. Sweet balls in syrup on the other hand..."}
{"text":"Given their name, you'd think the butter chicken would be better? But I found it weird, with tough chicken and a bland tomato base sauce. I tried all their varieties of butter chicken and they were all one-note.  What I can definitely recommend is their palak paneer, which is heavenly. Creamy, flavourful spinach, delicately spiced, and heaped with generous portions of paneer cheese. The best palak paneer I've had in Toronto by a long shot!  I only ever went for takeaway but the staff at their little takeout window was always very friendly."}
{"text":"This is such a cozy restaurant that has side street parking which makes it a great location to for date night. We usually opt for little India or Lahore tikka which is around the neighbourhood. We were pleasantly surprised with a nice warm atmosphere the restaurant was!   We started off with the vegetable samosas that were very nicely plated and cut in half for easy eating. It was very good, fresh, hot and crispy. Then our mains arrived which was the a lamb biryani and a sizzling hot platter of assorted meats. They were very accommodating when we wanted to change the regular naan to garlic naan. The garlic naan really brings an extra layer of flavour to the dish!   It's a shame that we didn't have room for dessert because by far this was the first restaurants that showed a variety of Indian cuisine desserts that looked very appetizing!   I think this is a great place to eat and we would consider it for another date night!! Definitely will try the dessert next time!"}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food in Toronto bar-none.  I've had them all, literally I have, and there is a lot of crap indian food, and BCF has delivered flavour again and again.  Spicy, flavorful... delicious. Where have you been my whole life?  Always order everything extra spicy and have never been disappointed.  Bomb!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Go to place for Indian takeout, the combo meals are a great way to sample the menu. The kebabs though...amazing  Cabbagetown gem."}
{"text":"I've given this place a few more shots after my first negative experience, and I'll eat (some) of my words... along with my vindaloo... from BCF.   They are \"factory\"-like with some of their more *main-stream dishes (butter chicken a bit bland, mutter paneer is a bit too greasy), but I've delved into their goat and eggplant dishes and I must say they also have some authentic and unique things going on.   Warm cozy atmosphere, and the service has figured out its jive. They are still VERY slow if you get delivery. They also have a take-out window.  *I understand I am a tiny, pale Nova Scotian, but I have loved me enough Indian food in my day to feel I understand the difference between westernized and authentic. I think. Maybe not fully, but I've eaten buckets of it. So, take my judgement for what you will. :)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place, they have been around for a while so figured it must be decent and came to find out that other then some very slow service the food and the place itself are very nice. The Butter Chicken Factory is a small but cozy place and they have very good indian food for very reasonable prices. I would recommend this place to any Indian food lover."}
{"text":"Butter chicken factory, what can I say??  I am simply \"addicted\" to their food. Good location, great service and Excellent food. I have tried butter chicken, Beriani rice with meat, Chicken kebab, Vegetable Samosa and of course, Naan.  Delicious food always, the amount of spice is just right. I have gone there 2 times, small and cosy place.  I ordered several times. They deliver on time.  Among Indian food restaurants Butter chicken factory is my favourite.  Enjoy your experience :)"}
