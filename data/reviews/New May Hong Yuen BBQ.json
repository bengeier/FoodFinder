{"text":"Came here to get a Bbq duck on rice, for takeout.  The place is hidden down the side of an alley and I only recently noticed this place.  The duck tasted ok but the skin was terrible.  It was dark and not glistening.  Came with a big soup of the day too and was only $5.25 + tax.  

These stand alone Bbq shops need to have a better product than you can get at the supermarkets, to compete.  Otherwise, why go here especially, and pay more than at supermarkets?  I might come here again if I was in the area and looking for a rice box."}
{"text":"If you have never experienced Chinese BBQ in its authentic, old glory, please come here.  This is the BBQ I grew up with.  

I took out a BBQ combo plate ($7), which consisted of BBQ pork, roast pork and soy sauce chicken.  I bought half a marinated duck ($12) separately.  As you could see in picture - great colours made your drool.  The owners are amazingly good at barbecuing pork.  The skin of the roast pork was super crunchy.  The meat was moist.  Well, the 1cm thick fat did its job at protecting the meat from drying.  BBQ pork tasted rich with a balanced mix of savoury and sweet.  The meat was moist and not fatty.  Should you prefer lean pork, skip the roast pork and get the BBQ pork.

The chicken was less impressive by comparison.  It tasted bold (aka soya flavoured).  I liked the chicken, but I bet some people would find it too salty.  The marinated duck meat was very moist and, you guessed it, bold flavoured, and very fatty.  In hindsight, I would go for a roast duck next time.  Hopefully, the roasting will burn away some of the duck fat.

It is as good as it gets if you like old fashioned, fatty (that is old fashioned, too), bold flavoured Chinese BBQ meat.  If you prefer lean, healthy BBQ, New May Hong Yuen would not earn 5 stars from you.

ADDITIONAL - I finally had the roast duck.  It was a big duck to start with, so it was, you guessed it, fatty.  I was glad the roasting had burnt some of the fat away.  Skip the sauce, as the duck was salty enough."}
{"text":"New May Hong Yuen is definitely a hidden gem.

Small, hidden and tucked at the side of a busy plaza. I have been to the plaza numerous time and this is the first time I notice this little shop.

Strictly a take out place as the storefront is so small. There is hardly room for you to even move around when lining up waiting for your turn!

I ordered a BBQ pork and Roasted Duck with rice ($5.50) for a late lunch. The Pork has a great mixture of fat and lean and have a nice sweet after taste. The roasted duck is tender and have great flavour.

Service is friendly and efficient with a smile."}
