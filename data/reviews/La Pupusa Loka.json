{"text":"This is a very good place for Salvadorian food. However, the atmosphere at times is that of a Central American tavern on a weekend afternoon with really loud ranchera-style music blaring out if the speakers making it difficult to have a conversation if you are more than 1 person.

The service is lacking. Allow 30-45 minutes to have mains served if the restaurant is more than half full.

The prices were recently raised. Again, the food is very good but I'm out on the cost-benefit trade-off."}
{"text":"Pupusa is awesome! Go supreme...Or go home! And a sopa to boot. For the kicker....they got ceviche! Saving that for next time."}
{"text":"pupusa is good but you have to wait 30 mins to get 3 pupusas ready. If they have a big table (which means bigger tips) dont bother expecting for them to make you feel just as important. The plates are very pricey and waiting time is just too much. There's also always a weird guy who talks to everyone which is very off-putting. 
And it would also help if they dressed alittle more appropriately. Nobody wants to see their armpits"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I waited over 40 minutes for my food! If you want good service and authentic El Salvadorian food there's a amazing place by Jane st and MacDonald"}
{"text":"The pupusas here are OK at best. There is too much masa and not enough cheese and pork. It's really grungy in here so don't expect a whole lot."}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. I loved that as soon as you enter you feeling like you're in Latin America. The food tastes and looks very authentic. We ate popusas de queso con chicharon and drank orchata...yummy yummy. I will definitely return.

The only downfall is the service was extremely slow. Only one or two servers for a full restaurant. It seems that there was just one cook on duty."}
{"text":"Probably one of the grossest places ever. I mean first off when I went, there was a drunk man who constantly stared at my table with a plastic cup of beer in his hands.. I'd hope he brought it from home because it didn't look appealing.. While we were waiting for our order. WHICH BY THE WAY CASH ONLY.

Second I ordered cheese Papusa and it tasted like cold bread in stale dollar store cheese.

The lady was constantly on her phone and seemed too distracted to take the payment for our order.. Which again I would like to mention CASH ONLY..
And worst of all it seems as if they reuse their plastic one time use cutlery because clearly my utensils had stains all over them.
The place looks like an old washed up gas station.. With wires hanging everywhere with a neon green and bright orange split coloured wall.. 

And to conclude they put our order to go and didn't even have the audacity to put the salsa dip sauce and coleslaw in a sealable container. No you wanna know what they did? They put them in small plastic bags.. Yeah they put the sauce in plastic bags. 

Let the review speak for itself, and 
DONT GO THERE"}
{"text":"We are delighted with their menu and it was very flavourful, the price was reasonable, and generous on the serving, however the service is quite slow and the atmosphere needs a makeover. But definitely we are coming back..."}
{"text":"The food is so good. I've tried pupusas elsewhere but I keep coming back here. Salsa nice tomato taste and.I like the cabbage. 

Unfortunately that's all this place has going for it. Service is horrible. They don't even care. Didn't check on our table once and left all the dirty plates in front of us after we sat. No drink refills. Zero. Didn't bring bill. We had to go up to them to get bill. And yes CASH ONLY hmmmmmmmm. Music was also blasting reggaeron to the point I couldn't have a good conversation. 

You're better off doing take out so that you don't have to sit there.

Amazing food though...dammit"}
{"text":"Convenient to home but prefer take out over dining in-service is slow and they don't really acknowledge you u leaving dirty plates after You've eaten and they don't come and check on u to see if how the food is or if u need a refill!
It is pricey for what u get compared to other Latin restaurants and they take $cash only!
Pupusas r really greasy as well, I mean how could u mess that up!
If ur watching a soccer game and want to have a beer then by all means U'll be fine but for service and food..I'd go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak. The waitress told me to get a specific plate as it is the \"same steak\" but it's less expensive. 
BIG MISTAKE. When the plate came it was not even a four oz steak. Paper thin and over cooked. They also had on the plate about three tablespoons of rice. A cup of dried out tasteless beans and a cup sour cream and a whole yellow plantain that wasn't even cooked properly. 
The worst plate of food I have ever been served. 
The pupusa is the only thing good on the menu. 
My daughter order the Lomo Saltado. And the plate was enormous but it was about 3 onions and 2 peppers with about 6 tiny slivers of beef.  
What a waste of money and time. 
Such a disappointment"}
{"text":"Love the environment, very Latin America. Waitress was fast to order and kind. I will come in and recommend it to all my friends"}
{"text":"I love pupusas as I was introduced to this dish by my best friend who's from El Salvador. So I was looking forward to visiting this restaurant to see how their pupusas stack up. 

This review is based on my takeout experience only. 

I ordered the Cheese and the Cheese/Chicken pupusas for takeout. It took a while to come out as it seems that they make them to order. No issue with placing my order, just a personal annoyance that this place won't take debit or credit. 

The restaurant is spacious and plenty of tables. Clean inside. The plaza is fairly busy and parking might be an issue. They play Latin music fairly loud and there's TV showing soccer/sports most of the time. 

I love their cheese pupusa. I love their dough and how cheesy they make it. The cheese and chicken combination doesn't work that well. Each pupusa cost $3 each plus tax. They give you coleslaw (curtido) and a tomato sauce. I asked for a hot sauce and it's hot. Be careful! 

I'm looking forward in trying out their other choices. Their rating should be around 3 1/2*."}
{"text":"This happened all by accident. Some South American co-workers and I were having happy hour and they wanted to watch a soccer game. 

They chose a location close to yorkdale and La Pursa Loca was it, this is an family Run El Salvadorian restaurant. I dont know if this is because it was after the game or not; but the crowd was 90 percent Males chilling after work and enjoying cerveza's while watching the game. 

One of my co-workers suggested that I order a Papuso (then a bunch of dirty jokes happened). I asked the waitrress for the chicken and cheese and to kindly add jalapenos as well. The stuff was delicious . 

it was a fusion of Toritalla and Roti and Paratha all in one.Topped with a coleslaw and tomato sauce and hot sauce as well.

Beware: the xxxxxhot sauce is exactly what it sounds like. I love spicy food but this one got me! I had to literally breath with my mouth open foe ten minutes after the meal. Ah well- nothing more Corona's cant fix..try if you are brave!"}
{"text":"Was a little biased before coming here cause I haven't exactly had the best experience eating pupusas in the past. Wasn't all too excited to be honest.  

This place was quite spacious and well lit. Quite busy as well.  

Ordered some cheese and mixed pupusas.  After a little waiting time we got them fresh and they we actually pretty good.  I might just even consider going again.   

Before this place I honestly didn't have hope in any Salvadoran food."}
{"text":"Having Spanish roots I am very partial to Latin American food. In Toronto there is no shortage of places to go. This has been my first visit here, however, it will not be the last.

I ordered the usual things I know from El Salvador cuisine: pupusas, beans, plantain, and horchata. I has very happy with the different selection of pupusas they had, my favorite is still the mixed on with pork and red beans or the cheese only. Both were made to order and made right! The dressing is always very good and the sauce seems to be home made. The rice drink which is typically easy to make can be screwed up if not done properly, however, it was done very well here. I must say that the dining room area is much bigger in the inside then looking in from outside would suggest. 

My only cons to this place is that the service was a little slow, and that they do not take plastic (debit or credit), I cannot express how much I hate establishments that do not! It's the 21st fucking century get with the times!!"}
{"text":"In the past I have complained about their EXTREMELY slow and lackadaisical  service and attitude but I just can't stay away from their Pupusa... BUT... that has all changed... or maybe I got them on a good day... the service was very prompt, and somewhat friendly and the pupusas were delicious, satisfying and very affordable. When Canadians, especially the young folk, experience this, they will be hooked. I'm surprised these places aren't packed with college kids on a budget...

What is a pupusa.... well imagine deliciousy goodness in a flat corn tortilla for only about $2.50.  You can eat three and be very satisfied... I ate four the other day and was stuffed...

Wikipedia: A pupusa (Spanish pronunciation: [pupusa], from Pipil pupusaw) is a traditional Salvadoran dish made of a thick, handmade corn tortilla (made using masa de ma√≠z, a cornmeal dough used in Mesoamerican cuisine) that is usually filled with a blend of cheese, pork and beans.

Then they top it off with some slaw and a type of tomato sauce.
They will have several varieties.  Other fillings, veggie style, meat only style, etc."}
{"text":"I went here during my 1 hour  lunch break because of the reviews.  

Pros: their carne asada portion is juicy, their tortillas are delicious, the place is large so I'm assuming you wouldn't have to wait too long for a table

Cons: it took me 45 minutes to get my food so I wasted my lunch break (I had to eat while working); everything is quite overpriced, I paid $5 for fried plantains expecting a good amount but I got probably 1 plantain cut in half, their entrees are pretty pricey too; the rice tasted like rice you normally get with Greek food, it's not really a big con but I prefer Spanish rice (if that's a thing); steak wasn't seasoned that great 

I'm definitely going to keep looking for a better Spanish/Salvadoran restaurant near my workplace."}
{"text":"Great Pupusas!  Even better fried yucca.  Not the most appealing decor, but authentic food overrides that."}
