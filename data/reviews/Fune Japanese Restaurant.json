{"text":"April 5/13
Three of us walked over from the ACC for lunch at about 12:45. We had phoned three times to make reservations, but no one answered the phone. :(  We managed to get seats at the 'Lazy River Sushi Bar' (my term, not theirs) after a 5 minute wait.
What fun! Sushi bearing wooden ships sail past you and you just pluck off the plates that tickle your fancy!  You know what you're spending by the colour coded plates. We tried pickled cuttlefish (yummy!), creamy avocado & crab, salmon sashimi and others, while watching the chefs in front of us prepare the food. We also ordered chicken and beef skewers from the extensive menu. Our server was friendly and efficient and the chefs were happy to answer our questions. Good fun and good food!"}
{"text":"sushi is fresh as usual, but nothing outstanding. The rolls were good. Good service. I think the catch is the rotating belt, but since it is common in Asia so it's not that attractive to me. The plate decoration was pretty though."}
{"text":"The draw are the sushi boats moving by you in a moat, but the sushi itself, ambiance and overall experience is quality. You can just grab the plates as they go by, or order off the menu....or both. Be careful...some of The plate colors have different prices. I had about six different plates off the boat, and ordered 3 more items and a seaweed salad a la carte...nothing disappointed. This can be a nice $30 meal...or a $130 meal depending on how hungry you are and what plate combos/drinks you choose...be forewarned!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh. Can't complain. It was good stuff. Waitresses were nice to fill up the glass without having to be told. Service was ok, not much wait time. Floating boats were what we got sold to get in so order mostly sashimi as its better."}
{"text":"It was already past 10 by the time we arrived in the area to celebrate a friend's birthday later that night. (We wanted to try Yuzu No Hana but sadly, they close an hour earlier than Fune on Friday nights.)

We walked by Fune and saw the conveyor belt, and we just had to try it! I've had conveyor belt sushi a few times in Hong Kong and have always loved it. I knew it could get a bit pricey but neither my boyfriend or I have tried it in Toronto. 

We sat at the sushi bar where we could see the chefs preparing the sushi and sashimi. It was near closing so there weren't many choices, nor were the chefs putting many new dishes out. We just picked up whatever we liked from the sushi boats. The plates usually just sit on a conveyor belt, but at Fune, the plates are placed on floating sushi boats, which is kind of neat. However, the plates are not labelled. There is a set of plates that is labelled with the prices, by the colour and pattern of the plate. But they don't provide you with anything in hand that you can always refer to; whether it's the name of the dish, fish or price. 

Besides the conveyor belt sushi, we also ordered a chirashi sushi dinner and a tonkatsu dinner. I really enjoyed the chirashi sushi. It was nicely presented and the fish was very fresh and tasty. For this reason and this reason only, I would return to Fune! Besides that, for the price we paid for the tonkatsu dinner, we were surprised at how big the portion was (compared to the prices at Mississauga's Korean/Japanese restaurants). My boyfriend enjoyed it so much, he finished it before I could try another bite.

Despite being the last ones to leave, the staff was friendly throughout. The ambiance and decor was really nice. It's a little classy and a little romantic. It was nice since we were both dressed up for our friend's birthday celebration later that night anyway!

We will definitely be returning to Fune, and I think next time, we'll be dining at a busy hour when they have the most items on the conveyor belt. Looking forward to it already!"}
{"text":"It's not the best sushi on the planet, but it's certainly not the worst either.
Not by far.

Downtown, there are only a handful of decent places and I suppose Fune is one of them.

But the real reason anyone goes is that the sushi bar is surrounded by a river, and you get served on a series of wooden boats chained together and floating on the river.

And THAT is some coolness right there. Best for a family or if you have kids or people who have never tried sushi cause \"raw fish is gross\" with you.

The service is pretty decent too."}
{"text":"I always passed by this area thinking about trying it. And now I got the chance for a b-day for a friend. We ate right at the sushi bar where there was a conveyor belt in a boat circling small plate samples from nigiri, sashimi, rolls at different price points from $3.5 to $7 per plate. Its all small snack size, and some are good, some are average.

We also got a salmon bento box priced at a whopping $24. The food portion is not too average considering our normal to big appetite. For 3 plates off the boat conveyor and the bento box, its a whopping $70! This place is definitely a one and done place for me."}
{"text":"I only ate at the sushi bar (conveyor belt sushi) instead of doing the a la carte and eating inside at a table, and I am so glad I did.

PRESENTATION: They replaced the industrial looking conveyor belt with a motorized stream of water that flows at a quick pace, where wooden boats that are hooked onto each other travel down the rotating stream, carrying two plates each. Each plate is covered with a plastic cover, so that it remains hygenic while it makes its rounds along the bar.

PRICING: Plates range from $3 to as much as $7 per plate, and each price point uses a different plate design. You will see sample plates with clearly labelled pricing in a trail of boats, so do not worry about not knowing the price of what you eat. 

PORTIONS: Each plate generally carries 3 tiny pieces of maki or 3 pieces of sashimi or 2 nigiris (sushi). The plates can also carry a small portion of Japanese dessert. 

THE GOOD: Beautiful interior design, great service, great presentation by replacing the conveyor belt with the stream of boats. Pricing is very obvious, and they are not trying to trick you with prices. Most of all, it a lot of fun to watch the boats go by, and watch the empty spots  being replaced with different nigiris, makis and sashimi. They have quite a selection hidden up their sleeves. Your eyes will be very happy. You almost feel like a child, because you are thinking that you should grab that plate before it disappears! You feel a little regretful if you did not grab something the first time and you are waiting for it, and you realise it is gone by the time it comes back to you because someone else took it! For me, it was all part of the fun.

THE BAD: The quality of the food. Sashimi was not fresh, and in fact, it was warm. When I ate it, the flesh of the fish was not at all supple and it tasted of nothing; meaning it was not fresh. Makis are also not very good...I tried the spicy tuna...it only had avocado and tuna, and as someone mentioned before, the spicy sauce was literally mayo and sriracha mixed together....ew. 
Also, they do not label anything, so if you do not know much about sushi and Japanese desserts, you are in a bit of a pickle.
Another thing is, you have to go at the right time, which can depend on the day. I went at 7, and there were only a few people at the bar. By the time I left, more people had come, and that is when it started to get really fun, because dishes disappear quickly and they are putting out new things you have not seen before. I was kind of angry that when I was there, they were putting out all the same ordinary things like tuna, salmon, escolar, and when I was about to leave, that is when they started putting out more variety, like mackerel and eel. I do not understand why they were saving the eel all this time...it is very popular...

I would say this is a great place to go with a date or for a fancy birthday dinner for 2 or 3 people. I would honestly never come back here unless I wanted to wow someone with the novelty of sushi on a boat and fancy decor and superior service, because the food was honestly below average. However, I give 4 stars because they are executing something that you cannot find elsewhere in Toronto. It is worth a visit, and for me, it was worth the price for the experience (not the food, though)."}
{"text":"Visited again in June 2016. Still very fresh sushi etc.  The boats need to be refinished and the washrooms needed attention.  One gross family came in, daughter (age 10ish) started grabbing at plates before hand towels came, and then she PUT IT BACK after taking the lid off.  Gross, gross, gross. It never occurred to me that this could happen, and nobody was monitoring.  Sick!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Fune for many, many, many years now, and the reason for that is the consistent quality.  Everything is always impeccably fresh, delicious, and portioned generously.  It's not a groundbreaking adventure in dining or trendy or rigidly traditional. You're not going to think you're in Japan.  But you will enjoy delicious sushi and light-as-air tempura, among other menu items, in a friendly, \"definitely not a chain or buffet\" ambiance.  It's our go-to downtown sushi spot, and we're never disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that people are dissatisfied with the standard of fish on the conveyor belt. I thought it was general accepted knowledge that conveyor belt sushi is not as fresh as sushi made-to-order and is often lower grade. As much fun as it is to sit at the bar and watch a sushi chef, I would not take the sushi from the belt. 

I admit this is one of a few places I go for sushi. It's not because it's the best or the cheapest. I come here, in fact, because my boyfriend and his friends used to come here when they worked in the neighbourhood. Now it is the only sushi shop that is an easy choice for the group of us. 

On my most recent visit, however, I was disappointed with the sushi. I ordered different items (sushi pizza, unagi avocado roll) that I normally do. Typically, I would get the rainbow roll, which has always been substantial and fresh and salmon sashimi and the mountain roll (fried hamachi with spicy onions on top), which is delicious and unique to Fune.  

They have a wide variety of food, including hot food. I thought the soft shell crab tasted frozen and I would not recommend it. Karaage (fried chicken) was ok. 

I will come back again, inevitably. However, if the food disappoints me again, I'll have to say goodbye."}
{"text":"This place boasts one of the most traditional decors with a large sushi bar with floating boats going around in circles.  I've mostly been to this place for lunch but I've been on a few occasions on a date in the evenings for dinner. 

For lunch, they have a special lunch menu.  Most of the things that I have tried have been good. The salmon or teriaki ribeye.  I did try their noodles - it was tasty but nothing too memorable.

As for dinner, I've always ordered a la carte.  The hamachi, ikura, uni, and salmon have always been fresh. I've also ordered the spider roll. It tasty but only comes in four pieces. I've had better spider rolls elsewhere. They have good oysters - 3 for $6.

The prices are ok - $15-17 for lunch and $40-$60 for dinner.  Its a great place for casual business lunches. The service is good and fast.  Reservations recommended for lunch.  As for dinner, the food it of good quality, albeit pricier than other places. Its a solid place to go to if you want a la carte.  However if you are looking for specialty rolls, menu items, or interactive sushi chefs, this isn't the place for that."}
{"text":"I was recommended by my friend to this place.  
I went there for a couple times now and really love the idea of the  floating boats,  There were 2-3 chief  making the sushi and sushimi in front of you.  You just pick the one to your liking.  I really enjoyed the food and environment!"}
{"text":"Since the demise of Sushi Train a few years ago Fune is the only place in Toronto I know of that has conveyor belt delivered sushi. 

The staff at Fune are actually Japanese (if you care about such things).

In Japan conveyor belt sushi places are usually quite cheap - cheaper than regular sushi restaurants (you don't need to pay waitstaff to take orders, bring the food etc. so it's kind of like fast food sushi), but I think because it's very novel over here the converse is true.

Having been a regular at the dearly departed Sushi Train I'd have to say that Fune while decent, is not as good.  The sushi on the boats is priced per plate, the different colours of the plates indicates the price.  The first problem is just that there are I think 7 or 8 different prices  based on the different plate designs so a blue plate with white dots costs one amount but a white plate with blue dots cost a different amount, and it's really difficult to remember what prices the 7 or 8 colours mean. 

In order to find out the price of each plate you have to wait till the price guide plates come around at the end of the conveyor which takes a few minutes, and hope you remember it as all the food goes by, so you basically have no way of knowing what everything costs since it's really confusing.

I resorted to taking a few pictures of the price plates with my phone, but then having to pull out the pictures and sort through them as the food sailed by wasn't ideal either.  They should just put something up on the wall or in the menu that people can refer to, or have fewer price points. 

The sushi is also pretty expensive, with plates going up to $6.50 (e.g. for three pieces of salmon sashimi) it's near the financial district and the decor and furnishings are all very upscale so I can understand the price is going to be higher, but still for me the price isn't really justified.  The Sushi is good, but it's not amazing. 

Sushi train also had a very cool feature where each booth had a hot water faucet built into it so you could make yourself unlimited amounts of tea.  I know that doesn't have anything to do with Fune, but hey if you want to extend the do it yourself thing it was pretty cool, and it isn't present at Fune."}
{"text":"When you go to Fune, you're definitely going for the novelty and experience versus the food.  I've walked by this restaurant many times and ended up going on a whim with a friend of mine.  We sat at the sushi bar and were mesmerized as the boats floated by us with a good variety of different sushi and sashimi options.  They have a dinner menu as well, but we decided to stick with the boat buffet.

Each item is on a specifically designed plate as to denote the price of each dish.  They ranged from approximately $3.50-$6.00 per plate, so it's best to pay attention because you can rack up a hefty bill fairly quickly.  As time went on, the chefs would switch it up and put new items on the boats.  We stayed for a bit as to not miss out on anything.  The plates are also all covered so it's a bit difficult to see what was inside so I found myself staring at the boats very intensely as they passed me

I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I know that I have had better.  The sushi was good, but definitely not worth the price tag.  Because the sushi sits on the boats until someone picks them up, some of the sashimi had dried a bit.  The rolls and maki could have used a bit more seasoning as well.  However I did enjoy my time there.  The atmosphere is very intimate and the staff were readily available to help out.  There were a couple times that I picked up a plate only to realize I didn't want it, but the boat had floated by and I couldn't put it back.  The staff noticed and kindly took the plate away.

I'm very glad I finally went to Fune, and I'll probably go again, but it would have to be for a special occasion.  The novelty is definitely worth it.  I might have to reconsider bringing my boyfriend though.  With only 2-3 pieces on each plate, his bill might come up to $1000!"}
{"text":"Was at lunch and had the best beef udon! (Beef very thick and tender - feels like Kobe beef!) and noodle very bouncy!! Definitely something different and unique!"}
{"text":"I'm a west coast food snob, and I'm here to testify: this place rocks.  Best hamachi kama I've ever had.  Spicy tuna rolls that were all about the big chunks of awesome tuna and weren't a blended-into-oblivion mess of tuna and mayo.  Service had a little trouble getting started, but then was quite polite and attentive.  A little pricey, but I think that's par for the financial district."}
{"text":"Come here once for the novelty of the sushi-belt boats. Bring a camera too!

If you decide to come again, you might want to order off the menu. 

The items in the boats are expensive (based on quantity and freshness). Some items taste like it's been there all day. 

Stuff from the menu is expensive too, but since it hasn't been sitting on a plate circling around a sushi chef all day, it's fresh. Quite tasty too."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi. It's a novelty (and more than a little gimmicky) but definitely worth a try. It is with this mindset that I went to Fune one night for dinner after seeing decent reviews online. 

The ambiance is fantastic. You sit at the sushi bar where you see the chefs making the platters of rolls, sushi, and sashimi fresh in front of your eyes. The little boat conveyor belt is a nice touch, since it definitely gives a little more oomph to your meal to see little boats carrying your sushi around the sushi bar rather than your standard conveyor belts that you expect to see in a factory. Definite bonus there.

The fish was very fresh and very tasty, melts-in-your-mouth goodness. The chefs take a lot of care with the fish, and it takes them a great deal more time and effort to make the sushi than I had expected. The rolls with the sesame seeds rolled right into the rice were fantastic. Being able to choose exactly what you want and just grab it off the little boats was a really great experience.

One downside: nothing is labelled. Which means that if you are trying Japanese food for the first time, or you're not familiar with a certain dish or fish, you actually have no idea what you are eating. Since the chefs are always busy, I personally didn't want to interrupt them to inquire what I was having, which leaves some question marks as to exactly what I had just put into my stomach, no matter how good it tasted. Then again, ignorance is bliss.

While it is a little on the expensive side, especially if you have a big appetite since the price starts adding up faster than you'd know, it's a worthwhile experience if you are looking into trying conveyor belt sushi."}
{"text":"Average sushi (from the train), stern/unfriendly but prompt service.

Sat down at the sushi train part of the restaurant (there is also a normal sit down section where you order from the menu). Variety of rolls and sashimi are lacking.  Also a bit expensive ($7 for 2 pieces of what looked to be white tuna nigiri, although didn't taste like it so I have no idea what that was?).  Some of the dishes were on the train the entire time I was sitting there, so freshness may be in question (although what I got tasted okay.)  Due to the lack of variety, I ordered the agedashi tofu off the menu, which was good (though hard to mess up).

Service was a bit abrupt bordering unfriendly, but efficient."}
{"text":"Truly a FUN-e experience. If you have never been to a conveyor belt sushi before you should try it out. Almost all the food I picked from the belt or ordered from the kitchen was great, the uni from the belt albeit one of the priciest items on the belt was not on so very fresh *dum dum dum* otherwise it was fun, waiters were attentive and friendly. They did charge me $1 (CAD dollar) for spicy mayo, really guys? Anyways, this place reminds me that I need to make my way back to Japan or Hong Kong where they conveyor belt sushi selection is much more expansive and I can sit and pick all day and not let it break the bank.

{"text":"I love coming here, I never have a bad experience. 

If this is going to be your first visit, go there with an open mind and know it's a little over priced. So if your watching your wallet just walk out. You're paying for the nice environment, nice service and your experience, so just relax and check your cheapness at the door. 

Each time I go the service is great. The manager makes sure you don't wait too long for anything. I always sit at the sushi bar, I like watching the little boats pass me by as I eat. And if there is something that you want but isn't passing by, they take orders upon request. I'm obsessed with their shrimp tempura udon noodles. Something in their broth is addictive and soooo delicious. Service can be a little too attentative but always on point. 

This restaurant is a great treat once in awhile to spoil yourself and I definitely recommend for a date night or something different and fun."}
{"text":"I went with two young men (10 yrs- and 13 yrs old) at the 13 year old's recommendation. His family had been before and loved it. From the moment we walked in and were greeted warmly by Norman, shown to our seats and had meticulous explanation about \"how it all worked\" we had the greatest time.

The sushi chefs were attentive and helpful. The other nearby diners around the boats were delightful. The wait staff was not intrusive but always at the ready should we need anything.

We sampled from the boats, ordered two beef udon: best ever! Broth of heaven, beef from the gods, leftovers packed up and accompanied by take-out utensils.

Freshest fish, great presentation, an experience not to be missed."}
{"text":"Fune's sushi bar is fun and delicious! Whether you are new to sushi or consider yourself a connoisseur, this place won't disappoint! Salmon and mango roll is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This is one of the first \"good\" sushi places I found in Toronto. It's located underground and depending on when you arrive it can be busy or empty. 

The most popular feature of the restaurant is the kaiten style conveyor belt; kids love it and often there are no spots available around the belt.

I prefer the sit down area and here waitresses are very attentive (perhaps to the extreme). There is a manager who watches to make sure the service is quick and efficient; she gives \"the look\" if they are not. For glutinos: they can obsess about making sure there is no gluten in your meal.

The food is pricy but good. Fresh, presented beautifully with many unique creations. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food at this place is very clean. You can sit at the sushi bar and have the choice of picking up the plate from the  sushi bar or ordering stuff on the menu.  I really enjoyed their beef tataki and spicy tuna. It can get a bit crowded during lunch time, so would recommend trying the place for dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful place at a price. Food is great, atmosphere is there, but only thing missing is a view."}
{"text":"I like the ambience, vibe and set up of restaurant ..classy and cozy 
Prices are ok
Portions too small for the prices listed
Customer service could be a better 

I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Yay! Conveyer belt sushi!  

Why just the other day I was commenting to the android installed next to me in the matrix that with all high-touch personal service and hand-made artisanal crap running around this town it feels somehow right to throw down large coin for the penultimate in impersonal service. 

This place strikes me as a Japanese restaurant for those who really don't care for Japanese food all that much.  Perfectly edible, acceptable quality - just neither particularly fresh or inspiring.

If you DO like Japanese food that IS fresh and inspiring may I point you on a very short walk to Yuzu?  You'll be glad I did."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, some of the best & freshest sushi I've had."}
{"text":"Fune is like visiting a familiar and comfy old home. Err - or maybe that's just on account of my being here at least 1-3 times per week for lunch.  I love watching the hypnotizing miniature wooden boats float by on the \"sushi-go-round\" moat.  It somehow makes it a lot less awkward in dining alone, like staring at a TV screen with only one channel/the fireplace channel. Aww yeaaaah, I would totally subscribe to that one. 

The sushi quality is a bit higher than AYCE.  Here, the glistening slabs of fish are cut a little thicker, the sashimi is served atop a shiso leaf, and pieces aren't like a car tire of rice the way AYCE places roll them out (pun intended, oh thilly, thilly Rando). But a certain other sushi joint close by has ruined all other sushi joints in Toronto for me, and I now expect no less than to be given a piece-by-piece served straight from the chef's cutting board to a plate in front of me.  I mean, all the sushi sitting on one singular plate at once? What am I, a peasant?! Pfft. 

Bratty kidding aside, the pricing here is reasonable for the area. For example, an order of ika sashimi is $10 as opposed to a much stingier portion for about $15 at a neighbouring sushi place. I recommend to skip the greasy, heavy-battered tempura and try the nabeyaki udon instead. Broth sweetened by the nappa cabbage, my tip is to eat the scallop before it turns rubbery..."}
{"text":"This place is really good. It's nice environment, you'd expect to pay a lot for a meal, but the first time I came here for a work farewell I had the sirloin steak for 10$. I go almost every week for it. It's one of the best steaks I've ever eaten (consistent every time) and super cheap and a nice environment."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great environment. 

We love coming to Fune. There is always so much variety and the food is always super fresh. 

The price is right for the amount of food you get with your meal and the quality of the meal!"}
{"text":"Went here recently excited to enjoy a wholesome Japanese meal after work. 

I think they must have changed chef's because the food is not what I was used to coming here many many + many times before.

The sashimi dinner and sushi were not fresh at all.

I also ordered my staple \"Oyako-don\" which I thought this was one of the best places to go for it. It came out really soggy and disgusting. Did not eat close to a 1/3 of it. 

:( 

Fune what happened?

I am sad to say this but we may not even return again.."}
{"text":"Had a company lunch today and we sat by the bar beside the kaiten sushi (the circling floating boats). Essentially, how it works is that you grab whatever dish you want (price ranges based on the colour of the plate from $3 to $7, and most sashimi tends to fall in the upward end). The bill total is then calculated based on the dishes you eat and the type of dish.

We started with miso soup and tea, and then jumped right into action! Not going to lie... I grabbed 8 plates in total and dug in like a savage. I started with a plate of salmon and white tuna, as well as red snapper and some sort of butterfish. I then also had two pieces of scallop nigiri (one topped with avocado and another just normal), a plate of seaweed salad, and finally ended everything off with ika sashimi. The sashimi was quite fresh; the salmon was fatty and buttery, as was the butterfish. I found the scallop to have a slightly bitter aftertaste, and unfortunately, it wasn't as sweet as I would've liked. That said, the ika was very fresh. It had a nice bite but wasn't stringy nor tough. Each piece also came hugging a shiso leaf, which added a nice touch and flavour.

We also got some edamame to share among the table, and by the time we were done, I was absolutely stuffed! Service was great, but I was expecting slightly more from the food. Still had a great time, and would definitely recommend for those looking for an experience!"}
{"text":"Love the freshness of the sashimi! The conveyor belt Sushi place beats all other similar ones, with the plates of Sushi and Sashimi on little boats flowing round and round in water. Vibrant crowd at lunch time, the owner is very accommodative to find me a seat around the belt. Attentive servers and very clean restroom. I'll go back next time when I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good place for sushi... Great atmosphere setting"}
{"text":"Went to Fune for lunch with some friends from the office. 

Sitting at bar and picking plates from the boats floating by,  was great fun. 

Plates are colour coded based on price. 

Sushi/sashimi was fresh and well prepared. There was a great selection to pick from including dessert plates. 

Warning, in all the excitement of picking plates off the dragon boat , total bill can quickly add up. 

Definitely a place to check out. Try the bar seats at least once. 

Have Fun!!"}
{"text":"So I finally came to what was previously the only sushi boat place in TO. This is very japanese, people, so get over thinking this is cheap quality fish. 
Although with a party of 4, I didn't want to sit at the boat, so I ordered from the menu.  Started off I was starving waiting for my friends, but I gobbled down that marinated eggplant amuse bouche. I moved on to some more authentic japanese food once we all were settled. A plate of tofu served cold with bonito flakes and ginger is authentic, but the waitress made sure I knew what I was getting. Perhaps a few people were expecting Chinese-style fried tofu?  
A few of us wanted just sashimi to 'see what the place was made of'.  So, I shared the 16 piece chef's platter of sashimi and was so glad I did.  For $28, you can't buy that much excellent quality at any downtown fish market. It was all excellent.  However the rolls were really a miracle of tastiness- spicy hatote (scallop) roll was my fave, but the vegetarian dragon was cute and delicious.  Between the four of us, we ended up with two \"bottles\" of sake, 300 mL each, so really like splitting less than one regular bottle of wine. The sake we got was the unfiltered genshu kind and was decent, but not on the menu.  The price per person? $44.  With more food than we could all finish, two appetizers and half a main, this was a great value!  
The minus one star is for the service - we had to ask for water 4 times and it came around the same time as the bill.  Also, we had really wanted to fun place on Saturday night and we had to listen to not one, but two awkward first date-esque conversations because there wasn't enough background music/conversation to drawn out the silent moments at their table."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot - really good value for what you get in terms of the lunch entrees. I get the sirloin medium rare, which comes with rice, vegetables, miso soup and a side salad all for $10.00. The sushi and sashimi on the menu is quite over priced in my opinion, but if you want to try it - it's probably best to sit at the revolving bar where there are smaller and cheaper portions. Service is good and food always comes out quickly no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"Best albacore sashimi I've ever met. The ambience is really nice. You have a choice to be seated at a table or booth or at the very unique river \"moat\" where sushi floats on by. This place is very consistent with excellent quality fish and service."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner based on a strong recommendation from a hotel. The place didn't seem very inviting from the outside, but it ends there. They have a boat bar as well as nice cozy tables. The ambiance is soft with traditional music and is actually pretty romantic with the servers dressed in kimonos. 
 
The service was impeccable and the sushi was fresh and very good. The pieces on a few of the rolls were a little too big but I am not sure if thats a complaint :) I had a really good time and look forward to going here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the place is always nearly empty. Strange though, as it has some of the most delicious sushi that I've tried in the city. Though offering only a small selection, the sushi items are expertly crafted and very good. There's even an old style rotating sushi belt, which, I hear, is fairly uncommon these days."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!

Hamachi sashimi is absolutely the best I've ever had. It melts in your mouth like butter. Ordered one dish, and ordered another straight after. Rib-eye teriyaki is also fantastic. Philadelphia roll was OK. Banana Crepes left you wanting more. I had hamachi sashimi at Japango literally the day before - Fune is *much* better.

Atmosphere and service are fantastic. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for dinner before a show around King St. I've often come to Fune before Roy Thomson or the Four Seasons Centre, which are both a short walk away. Service is always excellent. Food has always been great. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Had to leave due to their not understanding my severe lactose intolerance (due to a new medication). Too bad since the food and service has always been great in the past.

Working around language barriers is part of the culture/fun of dinning out in Toronto. When the Fune staff said they could not understand due to \"poor english\" I was a bit shocked and lost faith in the restaurant, I can't be the first person to ask this question.

We ended up at another restaurant where our waiter did not speak english that well and we had a very enjoyable and lactose free dinner."}
{"text":"Sushi was OK but should be better for this price level. I ate here for lunch (when I couldn't get into my favourite sushi restaurant - Yuzu around the corner). Being a big eater, the colour coded dishes started to add up with a surprise a bill time :). I tried many things but not sure what they were called as you help yourself. Service was average.  Didn't try any of the entrees so can't comment on them."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my family.  
service is very good. 
appetizers are very good. the main meals are not bad but not as good as the appetizers. 
the salmon sashimi is just fantastic. 
the udon soups are fabulous.  great broth. the chicken or even the vegetable one are both great tasting. 

the little tiny bowl of cold appetizer they give u when u sit down is just amazing. its cold marinated bean sprouts and carrots with egg and toasted sesame."}
{"text":"At the current price it is not really worth it. However, I really love their sushi boat conveyor belt, it is very cool and don't see it often in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good experience! I've been to two conveyor belt sushi restaurants in Japan, and this brings back some memories!

I ordered toro sushi on the side (not from the boat), and it was pretty good, though the ones I recently had at Yutaka and Japango were slightly better and fattier.

I was also surprised to see some medium toro sashimi on the boats. Those were delicious! 7 dollars for 3 pieces per plate. Pretty good deal!

I grabbed 2 plates of Uni (2 sushi per plate, 7 dollars per plate) from the belt. For the price, the portion size was decent. The uni was also pretty fresh, although the recent one I had at Japango tasted better (but for 10 dollars for 2 pieces. It also had more Uni.)

One downside to the conveyor belt sushi experiences is that a lot of the same stuff keep circling around. It feels to me that if some pieces keep circling around and people don't grab them, the chef should swap them with different ones. Of course, you can always grab the menu and order stuff a la carte, but I would have preferred seeing a more variety of sushi and sashimi on the boat.

I also ordered a tempura udon on the side. The broth and the udon quality were excellent.

Service was also very good. The waitresses were very attentive. As for the price, it was a bit on the pricey side (as expected), but we were here more for the experience, which I feel was worth it.

Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 8.5/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"Best sashimi I've ever had in my life. Very fancy, a little bit expensive but definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Food is good but very pricey!  

This Toronto Japanese restaurant offers a variety of items on their menu including hot items.  But what will catch your attention is the sushi is served on little floating boats that circle the sushi bar and you can grab what you like.  The only problem that I had was that all of their plates were all the higher priced plates floating around even though they had different items, Fune's prices are pretty high for what they offer on that little plate.  

I ended getting a don because I didn't want to continuously grab plates from the floating boats because I knew I was already adding up my tab instantaneously.

Go in for the experience, but don't expect to get full unless you break your bank a little bit."}
{"text":"Manager accused me of not leaving a tip on previous visit and auto charged me 15%.  When i proved that i do tips they refused to apologize.  They dont know customer is always right!  Also serving sushi and sashami without using gloves ....stay away"}
{"text":"GREAT food and GREAT service. The food was very fresh and their tempura wasn't over fried. Recommend it to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday at 5:30.  We were the first ones here at the sushi bar and surprisingly wasn't too busy even when we left around 6:30.

Let's start with the pros:
- The atmosphere was fantastic!  The big draw is the sushi bar with floating boats that travel around the bar.  I think this is definitely worth going to see.
- The quality of the food was also amazing!  The sushi was all very fresh and of high quality, the chicken yakitori (a must try!) was moist and flavorful, and the tempura was flakey and not overly heavy.
- The service was very professional.  We were greeted when we got in, promptly attended to during our stay, and everyone thanked us as we left.

A few cons:
- Very pricey.  Ordering a mix of sushi rolls, appetizers, and sushi/sashimi from the sushi bar came to over $50 per person.  And we didn't order an excess amount of food.
- The sushi comes with wasabi.  I don't much care for wasabi and since they give you your own dish of wasabi, I feel that they should play it safe and not put wasabi directly on the sushi.
- Each plate from the sushi bar is color-coded with the price.  It took me a little while to memorize how much each plate cost.  They have a pricing guide that rotates with the sushi but you'll have to wait for it to come back around if you want to see it.

Overall, I recommend trying this place at least once.  This restaurant is very high in quality and the sushi bar boats were a lot of fun to see!  However, because of the price, I don't see myself going back unless it's for a very special occasion."}
{"text":"Fune is probably best known for their sushi boats that circle around the center bar of the restaurant.  You can simply pick up any dish you like and pay the fixed price based on the colour of the plate.  Some decent options include scallop, squid and uni.  If what you are looking for isn't displayed in front of you, there is also a regular menu to order from.  When I am not craving sushi, I often order their $10 sirloin steak, served with a miso soup, white rice and sautéed vegetables."}
{"text":"Sushi River that spins around like the movies! We sat at the bar and grabbed a ton of dishes but then realized how expensive it can be. They do have an A La cartr menu you can order from which sort of saves you some money if you are planning on devouring these fish like a Shark!  I ended up ordering some terriyaki chicken with my Sushi and it was delicious!  

The sushi is fresh and yummy as well and this place is definitely worth a try! Just make sure you bring your fishing rod to catch the flying fish...haha! Kidding...all you need is fast chopstix skills and you will be fine!"}
{"text":"This was definitely the most fun I've had in a sushi restaurant in recent memory!  Fune Japanese Restaurant is currently the only Japanese restaurant in Toronto that offers \"conveyor belt\" sushi.  What's more, their conveyor belt sushi is even more unique than the regular ones on a track because these were boats of sushi floating on water around a sushi bar!

K made reservations for us at the sushi bar where the sushi boat conveyor belt would be.  There's only a limited number of seats at the sushi bar so if you want to experience the floating boats moving in front of you as you eat, make sure you book a spot or arrive early.  (There are many other tables and a lot of seating in the rest of the restaurant, but those are for regular tables and dining off of the dinner menu.)

How conveyor belt sushi works is that each different coloured/patterned plate corresponds to a different price.  Whichever plate you take off of the sushi boat that has the food item on it, you will pay that for the item.  Thus, it's a per plate cost system. 

After finishing the item on the plate, you stack the plates next to you on the table so that when it comes time to paying the bill, the server will count the number of plates and how many of each kind you ate.  At Fune Japanese Restaurant, the plates ranged in price from $3 to $7.

We started with a complimentary appetizer that had seaweed, cucumber, and imitation crab meat in a pickled brine.

Highlights:

-The salmon sashimi was AMAZING!  The marbling on the raw salmon was so pretty and demonstrated how fresh and fat it was -- fat in a good way!  The thick cut of the salmon sashimi contributed to the perfect texture and taste of the fish and was so smooth and a little creamy too.  Best salmon sashimi!

-Salmon roll that was torched with imitation crab meat, cucumber, avocado, Japanese mayonnaise, and fish roe. This was the best (and only roll) we had all night.  We actually ordered two plates of these after finding out how delicious this was.

-The torched sea bream was also amazing!  We watched the sushi chef torch this one too and nabbed it right away.  The top layer of the fish was torched so that the skin was \"fried\" to a crisp while the underside of it was still raw.  The skin was so crispy and slightly salted.  It was just delicious!

-The tamago was really well done!  The piece of scrambled egg was huge when compared to the tiny piece of rice that it was attached too."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and enjoy the food and the service. I don't think I'd go back again. Neither the food nor service warrants the price. Missed it by that much."}
{"text":"Excellent high-end sushi restaurant with a well-implemented boat system. Really good quality on all the sashimi and signature rolls. Atmosphere was quiet and upscale, and service was good. Pricing was slightly on the high side but nothing too outrageous for a sushi place in downtown.

Unfortunately, the menu pricing was hard to understand. $12 for \"Dynamite\". Does this dynamite plate come with 4 pieces of maki? 6? Jumbo or small? So it becomes very difficult to anticipate if the value is worth while. Turns out it was four jumbo pieces. And this was odd; two pieces of salmon nigiri or three large pieces of salmon sashimi. Both for $5.50. Clear winner there, but a little odd nonetheless.

Either way, service was great, even for a 9pm sitting. Fune is open about an hour later than most of the other sushi places nearby."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this rotating sushi bar downtown and it was a pretty cool experience. If you are hungry or looking for value for your money, don't come here because you will end up racking up a hefty bill since you are just grabbing things off the conveyer belt and all plates are different prices. I would say the sushi was pretty fresh just not worth the price per plate. You also have the option of ordering a la carte. We did this because we wanted to make sure we were full rather than eating 2-3 pcs of sushi per plate off the belt. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki and I ordered the nabe udon. The udon really let me down and is what brought down one star for this rating. The broth had no flavour and the presentation of this dish was just horrible. The service was pretty decent and the ambience was really nice, had a modern cozy feel. Overall, this was an experience that I would only try once!"}
{"text":"So after getting our Blue Mountain on we decided to drop by Toronto for a spot of lunch. After a bit of research on the Internet, yelp, and some brainstorming, we decided to give this restaurant a go. Dropped the address on Waze and off we go.

We get in right about 40 minutes before closing time which is understandable, they close around 2 pm so the sushi chefs have already started packing up. Whatever that was left on the boats were pretty much what we're having for lunch.

I like the artistic nature of their plates, specially the sashimi plates garnished with shizo and daikon. These guys know what they're doing. Plus the nigiris, or whatever that was left was pretty good too. The tea was hot and the water was cold.

The host was very accommodating and attentive, so are the wait staff. We'll come earlier next time so we can take their full arsenal of sushi plates for a spin.

Thank you Fune! I'll see you again next time."}
{"text":"Fune is fune-tastic!

I just got back from a great lunch at the sushi bar - also known as the moat or the conveyor belt of goodness. It is the only sushi bar that I know of in Toronto that has the floating sushi boats.

What I love about this place is the freshness of the fish. I have never been disappointed over the quality of the food. The rolls and such are pretty standard. They do have some \"showy\" pieces that look great on the plate but deconstruct the moment you try to eat it.

A few great tips, you can order what you want from the sushi masters if you don't see anything you want go by. Try the Inarizushi (pouch of fried tofu filled with rice, edamane beans and tuna), tuna, salmon, scallops sashimi... There are some interesting looking sushi as well, still not sure what the fish was but it was melt in your mouth good and had a little bit of mint tucked in for good measure. My second tip is to keep track of what you eat. It is SO easy to over-eat since the food continously passes by! Oh and if you order ice cream, it comes with two giant scoops - worth sharing!

One tip for the restaurant - work on the spicy mayo. Mayo + spiracha hot sauce = not OK. Be adventurous with the spice. The hot mayo ruined my beautiful spicy scallop roll. *sad face*"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'd recommend sitting by the sushi bar to really get the full experience. The dishes off the menu are affordable, and the sushi plates range from $3-7 each. Delicious! 

Would recommend the Don Buri dishes ($13-15) and large portion size. They also provide complimentary miso soup and salad. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! 

I had nigh hopes for this restaurant. My wife and I dined there prior to seeing a show at the theatre around the corner. My wife ordered 3 sushi rolls and I ordered the Teriyaki dinner. After waiting for 30 minutes without any food coming out, I approached the manager. She ran back to the kitchen and came out with... the wrong sushi rolls and a teriyaki dinner that had steaming hot vegetables and very cold chicken and beef.  I spent $72 on cold meat and the wrong sushi. I got an apology and a denial that the food was cold... they took nothing off the bill and could care less that the customer was upset. I spoke to the gentelman in the front who seemed to be in charge... all he kept on saying was, \"I'll look into it\" ... he must have said it 5 times... how about, \"I'm so sorry sir, please, let me takes something off of your bill\".... very disappointing experience. 

NEVER EAT HERE!! -- I Won't!"}
{"text":"Most.Fun.Ever. We were directed here by a very nice doorman after not making the cutoff for dinner at Yuzu No Hana. This place is right down the street and below street level. We had no idea about the sushi moat until we walked in and SURPRISE! How cool of an idea. I couldn't help myself and started taking dishes from the moat while my dining partner ordered off the menu. I'm sure I spent more than I would've have by just taking things that looked yummy. But it was a great way to try new rolls and really made our night by stumbling upon something so unique!"}
{"text":"After passing this this Japanese food stalwart for years, I had lunch here for the first time.  We didn't do that boats (which rotate on a moving tram), but just ate at the tables on the side.

I had a sashimi lunch special.  For $14, it was 15 pieces of assorted sashimi with salad, soup and rice.  The fish was the standard assortment (salmon, tuna, white fish, surf calms, octopus).  Honestly, it was fine, but nothing special.  In fact, it was kinda unmarkable in all respects, but I can't fault it for anything either.

I would say the service was better than at most Japanese restaurants.  We always had water and they left us with the pot of green tea.  

Bottom-line is that it's standard Japanese food in a good location with decent service  and slightly elevated prices."}
{"text":"Wow.....
Imitation crab meat on sushi?
How cheap can they go?
Imitation crab meat is basically made of fish paste and flour, and it is very, very cheap in Asian markets.  And they sell it as sushi for $4.00? Probably it cost them less than 10 cents!
Other sushi had small meat on the rice and expensive.
Wow... do not go there."}
{"text":"Ask to be seated at the bar when you walk in!

This is the only conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Toronto (according to my friend who's a Toronto native). The cool thing about this place is that it doesn't even use a conveyor belt to rotate its sushi dishes. It's a stream of water with sushi boats floating on it rotating around the sushi bar. Such a cute idea!

The sushi, however, is pretty expensive. You're paying more for the experience than the food itself after all. Plates range from $3 to $7 and each plate only has about 2-3 pieces of sushi or sashimi.

If you don't like what's rotating or have a specific request, you can ask the chefs to prepare something for you or order something from the menu. My friend and I split about 7 plates of sushi and ordered a dragon roll off the menu. The total came out to about $35pp, which wasn't that bad since we're converting from USD. It's definitely worth trying for the whole rotating sushi experience."}
{"text":"A fun place to eat good Sushi! I love the floating sushi boats and their tempura. A great place to meet up with friends! If you're in Toronto and looking for a fun place to enjoy sushi, you should check out Fune. Don't forget the hot sake ;)"}
{"text":"I had a really good time here.  I sat at the bar with 4 others and we watched the boats go around, choosing which plates to eat and which to let sail on by.  (I don't actually think they were sail boats).

Food was good, better than I expected actually.  The chef's in the centre were talkative as well when you asked them a question.  Very good service here."}
{"text":"Sushi on Conveyor belts are so fun!

The sushi is fresh and the rice is quite flavorful but what a kick of surprise to have wasabi spread under the sushi to stick it to the rice. Is that the traditional style of sushi? I've not had it this style. 

Pricing is not too terrible but is on the higher side. I guess that is the way sushi cost crumbles.

The service is very nice. They are attentative and try to explain everything. Our waitress tried her best to find out the name of one of the fish for us because she only knew the name in Japanese. That was nice of her. I could have had more water refills but it was a nice time anyway."}
{"text":"The sushi here is absolutely FANTASTIC. I have had sushi at many places in Toronto but this by far is the best I have ever had. 

We came here as a group of 4 for a belated father's day dinner. We were immediately seated at the sushi bar and drinks were served promptly. I really liked the way they had the little boats carrying plates of sushi round and round the bar. I particularly enjoyed the spicy salmon rolls. They were truly exceptional. We ordered some appetizers-Chicken Karaga and Shrimp Tempura both were good. For my main entree i ordered the japanese RibEye steak which was cooked to my liking. All in all, i give this place 5 stars because the sushi was absolutely divine. Seriously if you know any better places than this please let me know!"}
{"text":"Come here for business lunch frequently. Sushi bar is decent good flavor, lacks variety."}
{"text":"I always loved the place but it was great to go there with my whole family, my son was happy with the floating boats and being able to choose what food looked great. My Eastern European father who is a meat and potatoes guy really enjoyed the beef/rice meal off the menu - there were intricately carved veggies into flowers, meat was well seasoned and good. I also liked pulling off the boats the delicious food :) Overall, great experience, a bit pricier but given the location, great service, decor it is worth the money because it is an experience."}
{"text":"I have been searching far and wide for a place in Toronto with a conveyor belt sushi bar. So far, I have only discovered Fune, in the heart of downtown.

The sushi bar here is not a conveyor belt, but rather a chain of floating boats rotating in an infinite loop. Same idea. A variety of sushi roll pieces, sashimi, and other things pass you by. You simply pick what you want from the boats--the price per dish is based on the colour and pattern of the dish.

The food is okay, but mainly it is a very fun and esoteric dining experience, which can get expensive quickly if you are not paying attention to what you are picking. There is also a menu if you prefer a traditional table experience."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and we will absolutely be back.  I do recommend making a reservation at the sushi bar because t was fairly busy when we went right after they opened at 5. It took a little while for the sushi to start coming around but I didn't even mind because it was SO fresh and being made right in front of us.  We were greeted with a nice lemon scented wet towel to clean our hands and a little appetizer of a bean sprout salad. 

The plates go by with the prices on them as well so you can know in advance how much each plate costs and you can just grab whatever you want d stack your plate which they count up at the end.  You can also order off the menu too. I had a shrimp tempura roll which was great. I also had a seaweed salad, California roll, shrimp nigiri and split a tuna tatami with my fiancée.  She had a tuna roll, tuna sashimi, tuna nigiri and a philly roll. Everything was gorgeous and so fresh and tasted amazing.  Can't wait to come back here"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese sushi, so fresh and flavourful! The staff are friendly and efficient, always making sure your needs are met. The decor and music is soothing and seating is very comfortable. Try the sushi pizza, it's the best I've had anywhere!"}
{"text":"Fune used to be a great place to eat before.   Not anymore.  Had very bad experiences   First, I ordered \"Botanebi\" sushi, and they served fried Botanebi's heads with sushi.  Sushi was ok, but the problem was heads.  They were rotten.  It tasted and smelled like rotten dead fish.  Spited it immediately.  Complained to the lady(not a waitress) like a sub-manager of manager.  She said that they would fry another Botanebi's head again.  How can I eat even new one while I was suffering from the rotten dead fish smell in my mouth?   Tried to refresh my mouth, but I could not get rid of the smell.   I completely lost my appetite after the rotten Botanebi's head.  Surprisingly, she charged it.  Told her that I was not going to pay for the rotten Botanebi.  She agreed it  and removed it from the bill.  This incident was happened last year.  Secondly, went Fune last week.  We ordered \"Otoro\" which is the most expensive part of Tuna, but they served the cheapest part of Tuna, instead.  Asked the Japanese chef (master chef)if this is \"Otoro\" or not, and he saw it, had silence for a while and started to explain what \"Toro\" is recently to trick us.  However, another chef who made it told us, \"I made a mistake, and we have \"Otoro\".   Sub-manager or a manager  listened to our conversation and apologized.  She did not charge for it.  The Japanese chef left our seats without saying anything.  Ass hole!  I have been going to expensive sushi restaurant since I was a baby.   I am wondering if Fune is always serving the cheapest part of Tuna as the most expensive part of Tuna, \"Toro\".  

The atmosphere and  waitresses are good.  Am just fed up with all tired chefs.  They do not know if fish is rotten or not.  They tried to trick us.  They move too slow.  They attitude is saying that they do not feel like working as sushi chef."}
{"text":"I don't eat fish. Frankly I am one of the few Maritimers who don't. So why should you read this review? Well what I don't like about fish is the fishiness - the smell of it and the fishy taste. As a newly converted sushi eater, if I detect fishiness, vroom vroom I am out of there. Good news for Fune. Nothing fishy about this unue joint. Place was full for a business lunch so we ended up at bar. My colleague was skeptical as her first Fune experience wasn't great, but it was at a table. The green tea was a bit non descript but the boatloads, literally, of sushi were amusing and quite fresh. Fune is noisy but side by side, we could talk OK. We tried lots of red belly tuna, some yummy light tempura, decent miso soup, and these cool little doughballs with kiwi jam in the centre. I liked the kiwi but my colleague did not. In short, when you read the reviews, its hit and miss here. We hit."}
{"text":"I did not have the sushi boat experience, but went with the a la carte service.

While the service was great, the food was mediocre. 

For that price, I am expecting top notch sushi.

I do give it props for some authentic Japanese dishes that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I came here and sat in the main portion of the restaurant so I cannot comment on the conveyor belt experience. The staff were very attentive and the food was good, though overpriced. I had the torikaraage, avacado and cucumber roll and almond cheesecake."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the Sushi Pizza!!! It is delish and everytime I'm on business in Toronto Fune is a must visit. 

I have never been disappointed with anything else I've ordered and the service is always outstanding. 

I usually sit in the main dining room and I love the red and dark wood walls. I have yet to take a seat at the cool sushi bar, where wooden boats of sushi float around....maybe next time.

I love you sushi pizza!!"}
{"text":"Today I had the chance to visit Fune with another coworker and the first time I tried their conveyor belt sashimi. Usually I come in to eat their sashimi lunch (which by the way is delicious) but to be more cost efficient - I ordered their $10 sirloin steak. Very affordable and reasonable pricing. 

Trying their conveyor belt sashimi I had the scallop, squid, and uni - it was absolutely stunning the freshness and the quality. This is also quite the experience with the conveyor belt and the atmosphere can be quite romantic. 

Would recommend the food, the atmosphere, and the restaurant to dine in for friends or as a date!"}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Bit pricey but you get fresh tasty food."}
{"text":"The service was extremely terrible, and racist. My boyfriend and I went there for dinner, and from the start nobody came to ask us if we would like to have a drink for start. It took about 10 minutes, and it was not even busy. Then we ordered, but the wait time was really long, however the table of four people near us, who ordered AFTER us, got their food BEFORE us. I ordered three spicy salmon hand roll, but the waitress only brought one... And of course it took forever for my teriyaki to arrive. We had told another waitress that we've been waiting for 30 minutes. Then she confronted her colleague who seemed to have denied it. Overall, their attitude was so shitty that we just decided to leave as soon as possible. Perhaps they saw that we were in our twenties and they thought we didn't have money or something.. typical Chinese-restaurant-owner-people mentality. (I am half Chinese and I am ashamed of their behaviour). Will never come back and will definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here last night and it wasn't very busy. I made reservations for the sushi bar as I thought the revolving sushi would be a fun experience for my mom and I. This is the only restaurant in Toronto that has revolving sushi bar. 

Friendly service and overall quite attentive. When eating at the sushi bar you can grab whatever plate you want on the boats and there are different colour plates, the prices range from $3.00 - $7.00 so it can get expensive if you have a big appetite. You can also order off the dinner menu, they have a selection of appetizers, sushi, rolls and noodles. 

Grabbed a bunch of plates from the sushi bar from salmon sashimi to mochi. We ordered off the menu and we got the following: Beef Soba, Mountain Roll and Fresh Oysters. 

Overall, the bill cost $100 including taxes and tips plus a pint of Sapporo and glass of wine. It was a fun experience to have at least once but there are definitely other sushi places that offer better quality in sushi and food in general."}
{"text":"I guess the concept was different, though their food was just alright. Due to their conveyer style dispensation, food was very limited, though you could also order from menu. Their food was decent but not relative to their price. 

Service was alright, nothing spectacular nor bad. 

Atmosphere was ok, it just looked like a typical Chinese restaurant setup rather a Japanese inspired restaurant. The only section that remotely resembles a Japanese inspired ensemble was the centre piece (conveyer belt).

If you have the money, and was looking to experience, go for it... though it's not that impressionable. On the food side, the food was decent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with a spontaneous lunch here at Fune, and my was I surprised with my first experience of a \"floating boat\" sushi bar! I super excited to see the variety of sushi/rolls/sashimi/desserts that were floating around on boats as we were seated at the bar. 

Note: there is only a limited amount of seats at the bar, so if you're looking to go for the experience of picking out the sushi you care to eat as they float infront of you, as well as watch the sushi chefs prepare the sushi, I  suggest you call ahead and make reservations if you're looking to dine in at peak hours, otherwise you'll be sitting down at a normal table and ordering off the menu. 

The downfall of my boyfriend and I coming in for lunch on a weekday was that there weren't many sitting at the bar so the same types of rolls/sushi/sashimi were rotating for the longest of time until seats filled in at a later hour (however you can ask the server for a menu and order off of it to get the variety you please). 

So, how the sushi boat system works is that 
each dish you pick off the boat is coded by different coloured plates wich corresponds to the price of that dish you chose (ranges from $3-7). Each plate will be tottaled onto your bill at the end of your meal, so BEWARE as the excitement of picking off plates from the floating boats can really add up if you don't keep track of what you're choosing to eat. 

Overall, the experience is worth the trip as there is a variety to taste that can be taken off of the sushi boats or ordered from the menu."}
{"text":"Blue Fin Tuna!!!! Yummy!!! I would also recommend the dragon roll cus it's absolutely fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We just landed from Montreal and came here right after our check-in. The Hyatt hotel recommended this place as this is our first visit to this restaurant.  Absolutely delicious fresh sushi. The chef and the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pro:
Sushi floating in bloats around a large table is a cool experience. Worth a try, but will not return.

Con:
Overpriced. Not Japanese owned and operated. AYCE sushi places are way better compared to this place."}
{"text":"There really are not many revolving sushi places in Toronto, so this makes for a very interesting experience.  Instead of a conveyor belt they have boats that float around the sushi bar.  The selection on the boats is a basic assortment of sushi roll pieces, sashimi and some other miscellaneous items.  Although I went with a platonic friend, I would highly recommend this place for a date night.  It is definitely an interactive dinner.

We went on a weekday for dinner and found that the place was quite busy, which means that the food on the belt was fresh.  The plates on the belt ranged from about $3-$6, and it was nice to be able to immediately start grabbing the dishes and not having to wait for the service to come around.

I'm not impressed with the dessert menu, I think they could have more Japanese desserts.  I skipped over their selection of cheesecakes and other generic western desserts."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite, reasonably priced Japanese restaurants in the city. They have a wide variety of maki rolls, sushi and sashimi, and some great options for those diners who are not yet ready to delve into the raw fish! 

This place has a great atmosphere, and it has many tables and a sushi bar with floating boats. We have never had a problem getting a table at this place and have always had friendly service. 

Generally when I go out for sushi I get an appetizer of tempura veggies with shrimp - this is done very well here. And then I generally order one other item off the appetizer menu along with a variety of maki rolls. What makes this place stand out above others I've gone to are the spicy scallop rolls they do. I've gone to some places that won't even do scallop rolls, so that's what makes this place stand out for me."}
{"text":"Great lunch-time spot, it's become a go-to spot for my business lunch meetings.  Quiet even when it's busy, very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, contemporary decor.  

Sashimi is really fresh and amazing, my recommendation is the Tako, Hokkigai and the Unagi.

The Scallop entree is also very tasty."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! My friend and I ate here last night and had THE WORST SERVICE ever. The servers do not speak English, which is fine, I get it, it's a sushi restaurant. Communication was difficult so our server messed up our order several times. Again, that was a little annoying at first but my friend and I were still willing to overlook it. Towards the end of our meal, I wanted to order the chawanmushi. Our server informed us that it would take 20 minutes to prepare - did I still want it? I said YES. (Easy enough to understand, right?) Since we would be waiting for 20 minutes, my friend ordered another beer. After 20 minutes had passed, I asked our server where the chawanmushi was. She had a confused look on her face and said she never placed the order and then ran away (presumably to check with the chef). She comes running back and tells ME that I had said NO, I didn't want to order it. Huh? How did she misunderstand YES when she asked me if I wanted to wait 20 minutes? 

At this point, we are very annoyed and ask her to just bring the check but if they would comp us the beer for our troubles. SHE SAID NO. A $9 BEER. For alllllllll the times they messed up our order, it wasn't worth $9. 

Now here's the best part: when we asked to speak to the manager, he came over to our table and defended his server. He said he couldn't comp the beer because my friend had taken 2 sips from it already. (And if she didn't, what would he have done? Poured it back in the keg and re-served it?!) This went back and forth for awhile and then he told my friend to \"BE A LADY\". EXCUSE ME?!?!? He needs to BE A MANAGER and learn some customer service skills! 

$150 later (NO tip), as we are walking out, the manager curses at us in Japanese.  Classy. 

My friend and I have informed both of our hotel concierges NOT to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was top notch, fresh, and delicious. Ordered the Sashimi Dinner ($30) and a glass of wine ($12), and it is definitely not an overpriced restaurant for what you get. I wasnt able to finish all the sashimi. 
The environment of Fune is romantic and relaxing, they play soothing music and the decore is subtle yet high end.
Service was fantastic, refilled our water regularly, checked up on us every 15-20 minutes, and followed up with us about getting more food and wine. We arrived at 9pm-ish on a Wednesday so the dining area was empty except for us. Maybe that is why the service was great? But no complains.
Will go back again."}
{"text":"Sushi, on BOATS! :)
The novelty is fun, but sushi wise, its pretty standard.
Was seated right away at 6:15 at the sushi bar, and things filled up quickly.

Prices are pretty high (as mentioned by everyone), but is a neat place to bring a date. Kinda fun for conversation and such.

Sushi and service were pretty standard. Pretty slow on the drink refills.

Note: They do NOT take debit. What places dont take debit? AmEx i can see, but no debit? Ugh.

All in all, there are 100 other sushi places with cheaper and better sushi."}
{"text":"I OWE this place a review! I had come here by accident a little while ago whilst I was in Toronto for the weekend. My friend and I were FLOORED by how good everything was. First, we were greeted immediately. We sat at the sushi bar (we were the only ones) but there was a cute boat sushi, kind of like a conveyor belt. As soon as we walked in, there were so many new dishes coming out. I felt special that they were making all those dishes for us. Needless to say, I was almost full before my Oyako-don came.....but I ate that too and kept eating from the boats. Everything was wonderful. The staff was attentive and even spoke with us in Japanese through the whole visit. I felt like I was in Japan again. Anyway I would DEFINITELY recommend this place for anyone who wants real Japanese food. My only regret is that I couldn't take this place back to the US with me!"}
{"text":"They are located on the lower floor of a building. We came here specially to experience the revolving sushi table. The design of it was pretty unique. It wasn't the typical conveyor belt type of sushi table. Instead they had wooden boats that floated around in circles. 

Came here on a Monday, the place was not half full. 

The design of the place was very simple. The typical Japanese type of feel to it. The waiters and chefs were Japanese and spoke Japanese. Communication with the waiters was okay, not too difficult. They were able to understand what we wanted properly. 

First, the sushi and sashimi that ran along the revolving sushi table. The plates ranged from around $3-$8 I think. Each plate consisted of 2-4 pieces of sushi or sashimi depending on what you get.  They have maki sushi, sashimi, niguri and some desserts. 
 
The sushi was pretty fresh, again, they serve sushi mildly chilled-room temperature which I'm not used to. But it was still pretty good. 

We also ordered sashimi from the menu since it provides a greater variety of fish. The sweet shrimp and scallops were really good ! 
 
Additionally we ordered beef skewers, each order came with two skewers. The first order of skewers we're really fresh and the meat was soft and flavourful. The second order was really hard and chewy. It tasted overcooked. As for the third order of beef skewer, it was soft again. It  was a little disappointment. 

As for dessert, we had mochi, dorayaki and a green tea tiramisu. The mochi was soft and chewy and was filled with red beans. The dorayaki was okay. The green tea tiramisu was not that good. It tastes a little stale. The texture of the cake was dry and not moist. 
 
I would've given the restaurant a 5 star rating since everything was almost perfect except the fact that we're some food flies flying around the table and the quality of one of our orders wasn't that great. 

However, overall it was a good experience. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Overall I'd have to rate my visit a 3.5/5

My friends and I came here after school one day at around 6pm on a Wednesday. It wasn't that busy so we got to choose a nice spot by the rotating sushi. The service was good and we were handed hot towels almost immediately.

The restaurant was nicely decorated and had a bit of a \"rich people\" vibe, since the only few people who were there were dressed professionally (compared to us students who were showing up in casual clothes and backpacks). I loved how the sushi was floating on little boats on top of water! That was super duper cute, and we got to see them make the sushi as well so that's another thing I enjoyed.

The colour of the plates indicated how much each of the dishes costed. It's a little hard to remember, but we had fun with it by making a little game to see who would remember the prices correctly. Prices range from $3-$7 per plate.

The sushi was pretty good and there was an okay amount of variety. The thing is, me and my friends were more concerned about how the cost of food would add up, rather than enjoying everything to the fullest. You don't know how many times I held myself back from grabbing the sashimi because it was one of the more expensive dishes. We didn't end up eating that much, but we still had to pay quite a lot. 

If you're a poor student like me, you'd probably be better off just going to an AYCE sushi place. That way you'd be able to eat a lot more, have a greater variety, and not have to spend as much. However, it was a really good experience! I'd love to visit again sometime, but definitely not anytime soon. Gotta let my wallet recover first!"}
{"text":"afaik, south of steeles, there's nowhere else to get sushi/sashimi on a floating boat. fune is unique in this sense. 

the setting is quiet and classy, but not stuffy. the servers are friendly. the fish is fresh and there is a decent variety of it. it'd be a pretty good place for a first date imo.

the above doesn't come free however. as many yelpers have already pointed out, fune is more expensive than other establishments. so if quality sushi/sashimi is your top priority, move on. you're get better and more somewhere else. for top quality sushi/sashimi without flourish, i would recommend kaji, yasu or japango."}
{"text":"I came here based on a strong recommendation and found it rather typical or maybe tired. The sushi was fine; sashimi fresh but nothing very inspirational. Good sake list."}
{"text":"ehhhh I would not order the sashimi set- it's rather expensive and the fish is not fresh nor is it anything special, AT ALL. please see posted pic. you could get this at any mediocre sushi place for less- and it would probably taste better to be honest.

I've also ordered the lunch bentos and those are actually pretty decent.

I also think the rotating conveyer belt of expensive sushi/sashimi selections in little boats is quite amusing and might come back to experience that again. 

BUT, pretty bad price vs food quality is what I felt..."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was unacceptable. The wiping down of the tables happened before the bill was brought to us. Two people got their crumbs thrown on their lap. Sushi boats were mostly empty for the time we were there. Poor selection."}
{"text":"Best sushi and sashimi in Toronto by far. The freshest you will find anywhere. The floating boats are awesome-o too."}
{"text":"Kaiten-zushi is such an exciting way to experience different types of sushi with friends. I'm really glad that Fune remains one of the very few restaurants in Toronto to still offer it. We were there for a birthday party recently and while sitting in a half circle around the belt, far away from each other was not the most ideal set up for in-depth conversation, it was quite a lot of fun.

The fish was fresh and the variety of offerings was large. It was interesting to compare tasting notes while some of our party tried new fish for the first time and to share suggestions of our own favourite dishes to others as they came whirling by. There were so many colours of plates (which indicate the price of each dish) that it frankly got too confusing to keep up with. Despite having given up on keeping tabs though, I was pleasantly surprised to find that we hadn't racked up as enormous a bill as I had feared.

Besides seeing all the sushi go by, it was also fun to watch all the faces poking in from the street level windows outside. The service was courteous from the moment we got our hot towels upon being sat to the moment we were given our separate bills and greeted good-bye."}
{"text":"There might be Japanese staff at this place, but the rice is not authentically prepared sushi rice, and thus is as close to real sushi as an AYCE place, and at least at AYCE the price matches the low quality.

Fune and it's old, run down dining room aren't worth the prices here.

For authentic Japanese food, owned and operated by someone who is Japanese, in a beautiful modern open decor try Yutaka on Dundas, it's the real deal and the food is as artistically presented as it is delicious.


Watch the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi and learn what the art form is really about.  Fune isn't it."}
{"text":"Really liked this place! Having lived in Japan for 4 years, I was missing Japanese food and this place helped! We didn't opt for the conveyor belt sushi but ordered off the menu. Everything was amazing! The place has a nice atmosphere and staff were super friendly. It's not cheap but it's worth the money. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night around 6:30 for the sushi bar and it wasn't crowded at all. Next time I would go a little later when there's more people at the bar. You get a larger variety of sushi this way because more people are pulling different plates of sushi off the boats. The sushi is priced based on the color plate that it's on, there's 3 boats with empty plates and price tags for each one. Then you simply start grabbing plates off the boats as they float past you. 

Sushi was very good, a little basic but I also think that's because we went earlier in the night. We also had the gyoza which was delicious. 

Nice decor and atmosphere with a few water features around the restaurant. Bathrooms were clean and nice. 

No complaints about service, the servers were prompt and the sushi chefs were willing to stop and answer questions about what was coming out on the plates and offer different things to try. 

One thing i didn't realize was how expensive the Sapporo was, they were $9 each whereas Canadian was less than $5 a bottle. But the amount of sushi we ate totaled less than $50 which is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch in the downtown core area!  I believe that this might be one of the first Japanese restaurant in Toronto that has the \"conveyor belt sushi bar\" concept but changed to a \"floating boat sushi bar\"...really cool!  As the sushi plates pass by, you can select the items and the different colour pattern plates will determine the price.  I did read about a new conveyor belt sushi restaurant called Hana but has very poor reviews but I'll probably still give it a try.

This is a great place for business lunch as there is a separate dining area which is more formal than the sushi bar.   They are also super fast if you want a quick lunch.  I came here with a coworker recently and we needed to rush back to work.  We asked them to rush our 2 orders of the sautéed butter garlic scallops lunch and we finished our meals in less than 1/2 hour.  There's a great selection of lunch entrees that are very reasonably priced from $9~$13 for the cooked food like chicken teriyaki, sirloin steak, garlic butter shrimp or scallops and these come with soup, salad, rice and sautéed mixed vegetables.

I've been coming for years and the food is always consistently very good here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food there was awesome! Very authentic and great experience for my taste buds... Love the concept of conveyer belt sushi on floating boats, but sort of disappointed with the limited choices - not many people were there throughout our dinner, and the expensive dishes that no one wanted to take just stayed there forever, and I almost felt like taking down some dishes just for them to replace with new ones... Everything else was perfect, the environment was nice and quite, the service was good, and I'll definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Once I tried this rotating sushi bar, I cannot stop myself from coming often! 

I feel like I was in a fish market to pick whatever sushi and sashimi that's fresh, and eat immediately!  The difference is its clean, comfortable and with great service! Not many restaurants provide a warm towel when you sit down, here I love this service before indulging in my sushi, my hands feel clean and ready to eat my sea food. 

The quality of sushi and combinations are great.  It surprises me the first time.  It's like yuzu or japango quality but a better price and the best is they rotate in front of me!  I think it's the only rotating sushi in downtown, it's amusing to have dinner here. It brightens my nothing much going on weekend! Love this place! Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty sushi and fresh.  The boats are fun if you have a child with you as I did with my 10 year old.  

With the boats you can't really get too many kid friendly options but they still have plenty of variety with sashimi, California and spicy salmon roll, tuna etc

Service was very quick and attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Fancy but not worth. Service was a bit slow. In general okay sushi."}
{"text":"I had a good time, but it was because of my friends - certainly not because of the restaurant and their overpriced food.

Fune Japanese Restaurant adapts the \"kaiten\" sushi serving style in Japan; that is, the chiefs would place sushi on small plates and send them around a huge table with a rotating conveyor belt or moating winds. The problem about this restaurant is it's damn expensive - a lot of the small plates (2 pieces of sushi) would cost you more than 7 dollars. Considering that the food are often not as fresh as the ones in the real sushi bars, people in Japan go for Kaiten because they want to save time & money just like how we dine in our fast food restaurants. Just imagine you pay 7 bucks for a junior chicken lol - that was exactly how I feel when I was at Fune.

Again, I wouldn't say that they have the worst sushi in town. I just don't like the fact that this place's price is not based on their food, but their conveyor belt (frankly I don't eat conveyor belts). Plus, kaiten sushi is rather mediocre and common in Asia. Fune's price does not match with both the quality of their food and the idea behind kaiten sushi. Disappointment.


Also, I ordered a Ten-Don on top of my sushi. It did not worth $20.00 (including tax) in any way. The rice, and the coating of the tempera were especially disappointing. They tasted like the bento box you would get from a typical Asian supermarket (where they sell Ten-Don for 5 bucks). They did not use sushi rice for the donburi, and the tempera coating was soaking. Sigh*


I believe Fune made their food so expensive because they are the only kaiten sushi restaurant in Toronto. I think some competitions are required in the future, so they will learn to make real quality food with decent prices."}
{"text":"year after year, this place has been deteriorating... really sad, as this was really top, 3 years ago... the same used and tired staff, tired furniture with falling down paintings, scotch tape to fix carpet gaps, torn apart dirty plasticized menus. service is no more than OK and waitresses look resignated, whereas the roster-male usher continues to act like this place was hyperselective, whereas it is not anymore....

food got along with the same deterioration, unfortunately.... red tuna was full of chewy inedible membrane, not  mouth-melting at all, salmon was fat and bland... salads were just watery bland, even the draught beer was bland! some sushis were still ok, but you can have the same basic ones tasting similar almost anywhere now...

that was the last time for me... with uzu and ja bistro around the corner, the wind has turned, fune."}
{"text":"Fune Sushi is right in the heart of downtown at King and Simcoe.  The restaurant is not that packed whenever I go there.  Don't know why that is because this place is amazing! The restaurant has a revolving sushi bar which is really cool. I went with my sisters and we sat at the sushi bar and grabbed whatever we wanted off the sushi boat as it revolved around us. Each plate has a different colour and each colour has a price assigned to it. Aside from the sushi revolving items we also ordered friend beef dumplings (gyoza) and shrimp and vegetables tempuras. For our entree we each got the sirloin steak meal which comes with soup, salad and a bowl of rice for $10! Such an amazing price and the steak was so tender. We had green tea ice cream and matcha green tea tiramisu for dessert.  This restaurant is a hidden gem amongst the many restaurants in the downtown core and it's a must try. Very reasonably priced for a restaurant downtown. Great service and excellent food. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Forget sushi on a conveyor belt... At Fune you can grab plates off wooden boats in water circling the chefs! The sushi bar offers a variety of sushi, sashimi and maki to please everyone's tastes, and of course you have the option of ordering anything else off the menu. 

At the bar, plates are colour-coded, corresponding to different prices, which are then counted at the end to make up your bill. This allows you to control your spending, though it's still not the cheapest and can add up if you get carried away!

The fish is very fresh, so far the freshest I've tasted in the city. There is also a calming waterfall along the wall and the decor is nice. Dress-code isn't casual or super-dressy; somewhere in between. 

I definitely recommend trying the boat sushi bar because it's super-fun for everyone!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch frequently, like 2-3 times/week because its really close to my office and the lunch specials are good. The restaurant is clean, service is quick+efficient+friendly and the food is always fresh. It gets extremely busy during lunchtime so come early. Sometimes I get takeout and its really fast, around a 10 minute wait. :)"}
{"text":"Sushi is good as usual, but nothing outstanding. The rolls were good, the sashimi was large and fresh. and service was fine. The decoration inside was pretty."}
{"text":"Service and a la carte food was great. The sushi on the river conveyor belt can sometimes be there for hours so be wary of that."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner, we sat at the revolving sushi table.
The design of the sushi table was really unique, they used boats that float on water to move around the sushi plates. 
The sashimi was pretty fresh, but it only had sashimi, niguri or sushi rolls. 

So besides picking dishes off the sushi table we ordered off the menu too. We ordered scallop sashimi, ebi and sweet ebi. Additionally we ordered softshell crab, sirloin steak and skewers

Everything was pretty good except the skewer, first time we ordered it. It was soft. Second time we ordered it, it was hard, dry and chewy. 

Besides that it, decent restaurant, nice design.
Recommended to come for the experience. 

Price: Pricier side
Food: Good
Service: Good"}
{"text":"Very yummy Japanese food. I stayed at a hotel near by so it was a good change from hotel food. I will go back at least one more time before leaving Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here for a team lunch.  I haven't been hear for years so I forgot whether I liked it or not.  So I ordered my benchmark dish \"chirashi don\"

The dish came with miso soup which was pretty much standard.  It also came with a salad and they used something like sesame seed dressing and the sauce was very fragrant so I really liked it.

The main entree arrived and the mix of the ingredients was mostly good (I say mostly because it used the cheap fake crab).  However, overall it is still quite good.

Unfortunately, I have had better up north where parking is free.  The price at Fune is quite high as well.  As such, so I can't add this to my \"reasons to go downtown\" list.

You also don't get dessert, so I ended up going to the Crepes a gogo booth at Metro Hall after the meal."}
{"text":"Arriving here for a late dinner with a big party, the staff was accommodating and polite.  We had a seat at the sushi boat which was enjoyable.   The plates are priced a bit oddly, for example the salmon sashimi plate which has 3 nice, thick pieces was the same price as the salmon nigiri which only had 2 pieces of salmon which were rather tiny.

The sushi quality is superb, and the rolls were delicious.   We had a very enjoyable dinner here."}
