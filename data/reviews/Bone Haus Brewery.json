{"text":"Great Beer and Amazing Decor! We happened to be driving past and wondered in. We did 5oz pours and Witbier and Raspberry Ale were our favs, but husband loved the Maple Mesquite Brown Ale. New to the brew scene and worth the trip. Open Thursdays- Saturdays! No food, but outside food is welcome. Come on a night with their food trucks. We will be back! Ask for Keith- one of the owners. Told us the back story of Bone Haus, all over great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the soft opening. Very cool old time cowboy/dia de los muertos saloon feel to it with a big wooden door and skeletons, skulls, and bones adorning the walls and big wooden beams throughout the brewery. They brew their own beer in house and had about 6 (or maybe 8) beers on tap and one non alcoholic ginger beer that they also brewed themselves. Majority were dark porter and stouts alone with a couple brown ales and an ipa. They were all very tasty and for porters/stouts, they actually weren't super heavy, thick, or filling and went down easily. The owner said they have some hefs and lighter beer brewing and will eventually have them in the rotation, but since porters and stouts take a bit longer to perfect, wanted to roll those out first to see how they were.  They do not serve food, but had a food truck for the soft opening. Not sure if that will be a recurring option, but food trucks and breweries are always a great pair. Beers are all fairly priced as well. Tasters, 10oz snifty, and 16oz pints ranging from $3-7. It's a smaller brewery with limited bar seating and a couple tables so it was a bit cozy. They do have a big community table on the patio though. Great addition to the Fountain Hills area, so if you are local or just passing through, give em a try."}
{"text":"I thought I was going to a new brewery, but what I walked into was magnificently macabre, craft beer experience! I've been patiently awaiting the opening of Bone Haus since the end of last year when I noticed the brewing equipment being installed.  I heard the decor was supposed to be really cool, but this place transcends cool. I imagine if there was a brewery in Disneyland somewhere between Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion, this would be it. And to think it's nestled right here in the side of a mountain shopping center in Fountain Hills.  Besides the atmosphere, they also make some great craft beer. The first run of beers covers a good spectrum of the beer world. They had 6 or 7 on tap when I got there. Everything from a Black IPA to a Maple Brown Ale to the Double Pitch Belgian Wit that I enjoyed. This is strictly a brewery with great beer. No food offered, but you are welcome to bring in your own,  have it delivered or catch the food truck when it comes around. Super friendly and knowledgeable bartenders and staff. The is even an area where you can peruse and purchase artwork from a local artist.  Bone Haus again is a brewery and that is what they are focusing on.  You can bring the kids, but they may not feel comfortable surrounded by death and skeletons. Also there is no food around, so they would be best just sat in a corner with their phones glued to their faces. This is a really amazing, adult-focused, hangout. It's tough to see from the road, but it's there. Hopefully they will have some better signage soon and their presence may help draw some more business to the Fry's Grocery complex that they are located near.  I'll definitely be back and I hope to see you there too. If you dare..."}
{"text":"FINALLY had a chance to check it out with a couple of girlfriends. This place could not be cuter - the Bone Haus lives up to it's name in decor! I did a taste of each of the five beers they had on tap, my favorite dark was the Double Coffee Stout (took me off guard, I loathe coffee) and the Raspberry Blonde. And now that you have brewed soda and are bringing food trucks in the hubs will be interested in coming with too. I plan on going again in the near future - I can't remember what they said is fermenting and will be ready in a week or so but I remember thinking \"YUM!\"."}
{"text":"This a great brewery!  They brew really interesting, innovative beers and then invite the public in to try them in their fantastic taproom.  The atmosphere is like nothing I've seen before, while at the same time being comfortable.  Its a great place to meet an old friend or make a new one.  We'll definitely be back to try the new brews and different food trucks!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were checking out the golf course next door for a potential wedding venue (which I JUST found out is where the wedding is happening...and why I'm now remembering to write this review now).   It's a really cool brewery. The decor is super nice & chic. Lots of dark wood that gives the place a kind \"homey\" & inviting place to sit and have a couple brews. Speaking of which, the beer we sampled was delicious as well! We each had a pint of the brown ale and liked it a lot.   We got to talk to the owners and they were extremely friendly as well. We even talked to them a little bit about potentially doing an afterparty if (and now IS) the wedding was happening next door.   They also have food trucks and Friday and Saturday that literally pull right into the brewery. We were there on a Saturday and left right before they got there. I believe on Fridays they do Mexican and on Saturday it's more Americana.   I'll be back!"}
