{"text":"Best alternative to the Ryerson Rez meal plan. The fries inside the sandwich only enhance the experience. The super BLT is delicious. Two kinds of bacon, with fries and mesquite sauce. So very very fruitful.

I've been many times now and every person I have dealt with has been the perfect mixture of friendly and professional. I must like it a lot, because I'm only one sandwich away from a free one! 

Once you buy 9 sandwiches, the 10th is free. It's a great little place to go for a quick lunch, AND it will satisfy you both in the hunger and taste dept.

Sandwiched has those departments on lockdown!"}
{"text":"Just south of Carleton on Church, this hole-in-wall sandwich place is much better than it looks from the outside! A little rundown, yes, a little small, yes, BUT really friendly service and a wide selection of crepes and sandwiches!

The sandwich menu is fairly standard, but the crepe menu is far more fun. We sampled a mediterranean chicken crepe (with extra hot sauce), and the ham/cheese/egg crepe. Hmmm delish, and made fresh right in front of you! They also have sweet crepes (next time I'll be trying the ricotta & strawberry).

There's also ice cream and what looks to be an impressive selection of milkshakes. ALSO, there were some tasty looking cupcakes in a display near the cash. I was pleasantly surprised with my trip to Sandwiched...which could be dangerous as it's en route from work to school.

Michelle A., add this to your close to Ryerson list!"}
{"text":"French Fries in the sandwich!  Amazing!

This shop opened up about 2 years ago, and that's when the magic began.  They have a wide variety of grilled sandwiches ranging in price of about $5 to $9.   They also have crepes (both sweet and savory) which, unfortunately, are not filled with french fries.

My advice is to go for the special of the day.  They are what really makes it worth it, because you get an excellent grilled sandwich (avec french fries!) for what turns out to be a really great price (in the $5-$6 range.)"}
{"text":"Went here again last night and was thoroughly pleased with my meal. The person serving us was a bit odd but they all are at this location, pay no attention to it. 

My boyfriend and I both got the Turkey BLT and we also ordered a Nutella Strawberry Crepe to share for dessert. They start off by getting soft sub buns and loading up the cheese and meat and then they put it into a panini grill so it gets all nice and grill marked and flattened. Once it comes out, you get to pick out all your toppings, including at least 5 different spreads such as hummus and tzatizki (which was YUM) and then the standard lettuce, tomato, olives, mushrooms. I think they have sauerkraut too! Then time for sauces, they have at least 20 different sauces, ranging from bbq to honey mustard and mayo. Next, in go the fresh made to order fries (be sure to add salt and pepper at this point) and then the sandwich comes together and gets wrapped. It is a fairly long process but well worth the wait!!

I love watching them make crepes here, I think anywhere its a pretty cool thing to watch. Our crepe had a good amount of nutella spread on half (once cooked on one side) and then she cut up fresh strawberries to go on the same half. It was folded once, I think she added more nutella and strawberries and then folded again. A bit of icing sugar and strawberries to finish it off and we were good to go.

The sandwiches lived up to my previous expectations - always yummy and nicely cooked/toasted. But that crepe...  *drool* it was amazing. It was really difficult to cut in half but honestly, I think it was worth the effort because we split one crepe and it was definitely enough for one person. I would have gotten sick of it if I had eaten the entire thing myself. Our meal total was around $25, but we both got drinks and we split that dessert, so for a sandwich and a drink, it probably would have been under $10 each.

Overall, another great review for this place, you really need to try it out. They have a pretty extensive menu and lots of choice so you can't go wrong. As others have noted, they have specials of the day and $5 sandwiches too I think, so be sure to stop by and try it out!"}
{"text":"According to the lady serving me, all the sandwiches are the same except for the meat and the cheese, which is pretty much what you pay for. Other than that, you`ve got a whole gamut of spreads and veggies to add on to your sandwich, from tzaziki to roasted red pepper hummus to sprouts. 

And yes, french fries in the sandwich! It adds a nice crunchy/chewy/salty potato layer to an already stacked sandwich. 

They have a 10% discount for students too."}
{"text":"Sandwiched is a Christmas-coloured sando-hole at the corner of Church and Granby just steps from Bulldog Coffee,  Their claim to fame is an idea really: throw french fries into all the sammiches. Period. I like this idea, and therefore walked in.

The service is super friendly here, and when they recommended the peanut butter milkshake, it's like they were reading my mind. In addition to sangwichos ($5.25 - $7.75), they offer crÃªpes ($4.50 - $7.75) which I hear are not fry-filled, pies, milkshakes and eight (8) flavours of ice cream.

I ordered the Reuben North panini. I should have explored the Wall of Sauces (24, I counted) a little more carefully -- the sammy was a bit dry. But for the prices are decent, and the PBMS was a great way to wash down my panini. I'll try it again.

Obligatory Title Pun: 'WICH one will you choose?

Menu Readability: As everything is slathered in red and green, I'll say only this: if you're playing with fire, you're gonna get burned.

Need to mention: Debit and credit accepted and there is a 10% student discount.

What this place teaches me about myself: I know 'nuff synonyms for sandwich."}
