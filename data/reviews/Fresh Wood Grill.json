{"text":"An eco-friendly spin on the local burger joint. The Fresh Wood Grill serves up organic and local fare, cooked on, what else, a wood burning grill.  On our visit, we decided to try the beef burgers. I opted for the traditional side of french fries, while my boyfriend decided to try the sweet potato fries. The burgers were quite tasty, and the sweet potato fries were an interesting twist on the classic. I would like to try the bison burger on the menu, and sort of regret not trying the daily special of grilled chicken with piri piri sauce.  We decided to take our order home, and were quite pleased to see the takeout containers were not the traditional styrofoam but cardboard."}
{"text":"The food didn't taste right and the place has no air-condition so you will sweat so much that you don't want to eat anymore. The place has a stinky smell too. Their patio is small and right by Lakeshore Blvd so you are eating a lot of dust. Their food isn't organic anymore."}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of good burger joints but unfortunately this place did not leave a positive impression. The bison burger I had was overcooked and over-salted. I appreciate how they have bison and are somewhat more natural than other places. Service was friendly and they had some cool music I was Shazam'ing while eating. The bathroom is really tiny. You can get a better burger in many other places. A decent burger spot if you're in the area. The only reason they get a 3 is because of the friendly service and cool tunes in the background. They need to raise the bar and beef up their burger grilling/cooking/whatever skills and lay off the salt."}
