{"text":"From the printed menu, ordered the Rice in Clay Pot with Fish Belly in black bean sauce for $8.99.  Took about 20 minutes to arrive on the table.  While waiting, a bowl of complimentary soup was provided.  Soup was good.  Visually, the clay pot dish looked good as well.  A top layer of leafy greens covered the toppings underneath.  Taste wise, the rice was ok, with a slight crunchiness at the bottom of the pot.  The fish was seasoned well, and provided a good taste contrast to the rice and leafy greens.  However, the fish portions were less belly but more tail portions,  Very little flesh and very bony.   As a matter of fact, a pile of fish bones was left at the end of the meal. 
Not on the printed menu, but on their walls, is a better deal.  $9.99 for clay pot rice with 2 toppings of your choice.  Just remember to choose something that does not have bones!"}
{"text":"My family came for their grand opening special of three clay pot rice for the price of two. The quality and the amount of rice is definitely worth the value, even without the special. If you're a fan of scraping the crispy rice stuck to the clay pot, this is the place to go. Thanks to the hotness of the pot, the rice ends up super crispy, while the rice on too stays soft and delicious. The service was super friendly and was fast. The restaurant seems to be quite quiet right now probably because of its awkward location in the plaza but it definitely has potential to be a go-to spot for clay pot rice."}
{"text":"We tried the pork and preserved egg congee, pork cheung fun, and the braised lamb noodle with a party of three. 

The congee was my favourite dish today as it was the perfect consistency and gave the same home-y feeling as the congee mom would make! 

The pork cheung fun and braised lamb noodle were both very filling and delicious. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but I still enjoyed the noodles and my boyfriend gets it every time he comes here! We got the small size and we're still all very full, so if you're planning on sharing meals be mindful of sizes and appetites! 

We also got an iced lemon tea which was not too tart yet not too sweet, perfect to refresh your palate between bowls of the hot congee and rich broth of the noodles. 

Overall, all the items we got were fair in price and were certainly worth trying. The service was also great and food was served quickly. The environment was welcoming and clean. I most definitely plan on returning to Harmony to try more of what they have to offer!"}

#1 ??? congee
Pretty good small bowl good for one.

#17 ?? fried dough stick (wrapped in rice paper)
Thin rice paper and fresh served with only soy sauce. They do not have seafood sauce ?? but you can ask them for??? peanut sauce.

#22 ???? fermented red bean curd pigs feet
5 pieces.  Not the softest I've had but decent.

#54 ????? clay pot rice w/ preserved meat
Small pot fresh and hot. Came with vegetables.
Only came with thinly sliced red sausage ?? and fatty meat ?? but not the black sausage ??. Not a lot of soy sauce or any sauce on the side provided. That's disappointing.

Overall it's ok, I'dcome back."}
{"text":"Eh, flavour is lacking. Not familiar with other similar styled places, but I would look around for alternatives."}
{"text":"It's your basic congee joint.

Simple food options like cheung fan, clay pot rice and congee are the main attractions here. 

Our table for 2 were the only customers on a Friday afternoon. I ordered the fish belly congee while mister ordered the lamb cheung fan. Congee did not meet my expectations but the lamb cheung fan was surprisingly delicious.

Nice option in this area, but not worth gong out of the way for."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today. My kids love clay pot Casserole Rice but I'm not a fan. So it was good that they serve congee and rice rolls too. They have a promo, at the moment, where you get one pot of rice for free, when you order 3. There isn't a huge variety of rice pots to choose from, I think there's 5. My kids chose the chicken & Shitake, pork rib and salty fish & minced pork rice pots. All rice pots come with an unsalted daily soup too. The rice pots came and they weren't fragrant when the lids were lifted. The rice was a tad too soft and the crunchy rice at the bottom of the clay pots was virtually non existent. I don't think we'd ever return for the rice pots, they are not on a par with Good Taste Casserole Rice, who have more variety and a much better product. In fact, my daughter mentioned that my rice pots were better than the ones here. I ordered a salty pork bone congee (which was way too salty) and a few rice rolls. The beef and pork were nice but avoid the bbq pork one.
I think I'd return, if I was nearby, for congee and rice rolls. But I'd not be back for the rice. Service was terrible. We were sat down and not given menus, we had to flag someone for some. One server was complaining that her wrist/arm/hand was hurting.... and being all miserable."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Not too many tables.  
There is a promo right now where if you buy 2 clay pot rice, you get one free.  At $10 for a pot of rice, this is a great deal.  
Was told wait for rice would be 20 min.  Soup came quickly.
Rice came shortly after.  Super hot.  We had the hainan chicken rice $12, salted fish pork patty rice $10 and the mushroom chicken rice.
Great service.  Loved that the rice had a super thick crust for us to dig into at the end of the meal.
We also tried the rice roll.  It is the \"crinkly\" kind, not like the ones you get at dim sum.  But still very smooth and fresh.
Hope they get more business because this is a nice addition to the area.  The one at Peachtree is very busy and wait time is extremely long."}
{"text":"Cheapest breakfast place in Toronto! Large potion and it taste good. 

Come here before 11am to order their combo. $5.99 for a large bowl of congee plus rice roll and a drink. $7.99 for a large bowl of congee and a large bowl/plate of noodles plus a drink. Their chili oil is soooo good!!! We also ordered their black beans paste ribs clay pot rice. Is delicious!! Taste like the ones you will get in HK! It comes with soup and vege. 

This place is totally worth it!!"}

If there is a Chinese diner category, Harmony fits right in.  Harmony serves breakfast to late night (opens from 6:30am to 1am daily) with a relatively focused/themed menu: congee, chung fun, lo mein (I don't recall seeing soup noodle on menu, but I can be wrong), rice in clay pot and hot pot.  We ordered house special chung fun, congee with blood jello and a lo mein with pork hog.  The chung fun was unique for sure: so much minced vegi bits that I couldn't taste the minced meat.  I guess it is a healthier option then.  The blood jello was really good, as in super fresh and silky.  The congee was smooth, silky yet I wish there was no msg.  True that there was just a little bit of msg, but I didn't think it needed any to start with.  The pork hogs were good, too, but the low mein was not egg noodle and it was very soggy.  It should be drained more before serving.  

Last but not least, friendly service and good value for money.  The portion was very good.  We finished the congee and the chung fun but barely dug into the lo mein.  We packed most of the lo mein home.  The total bill was approximately $25 before taxes."}
{"text":"Recently came to this Chinese restaurant and thought the food and service was great. We ordered the pork neck congee with preserved egg, the beef and the shrimp rice noodle roll, and the pan fried dumplings. Everything was delicious! Looking forward to coming back to try more, the rice in stone pots looked really good."}
{"text":"Delicious clay pot rice!! Love the chicken and mushroom one and the Chinese sausage one!  Great value at $9.99 each, this place gets really busy for it's cheap comfort food. They also serve rice rolls, congee, and assorted vegetables."}
{"text":"3.5 I waited a couple of visits before writing my review because I already had an absolute favourite Chinese rice casserole restaurant and I wanted to give Harmony a fair review.
I generally enjoy dinner here, service is decent for a Chinese restaurant and prices are fair. Food quality overall is good but their rice casseroles are not what I would come for.
I've ordered virtually every offering of rice casseroles, I like their \"meat loaf\" the most - just fat enough to be juicy but not greasy to eat. Their rice and veggies however are so oil drenched, you don't feel like eating too much of it.
Their soups are light and delicious, you can taste how there's definitely no MSG.
I really enjoying their congee and rice rolls. The quality is way better than a lot of restaurants that specialize in these. Definitely recommend their simple pork rice roll, it's just a simple product done really well!"}
{"text":"Fairly new and already lots of people have tried this place. It's clean, the service is efficient and good tastes great with reasonable pricing.

The claypot rice here is less oilier than the other places that I've tried, which is nice for a change.
The soup that comes along for starters is also tasty with the right amount of salt and you can definitely tell they don't skimp on the ingredients to make such a tasty soup. 

The rice roll can be a meal on its own as well as appetizers if shared. We had the homemade River rolls which had 8 rolls on one plate.

Great deal, good service, clean place. Definitely worth a visit!"}

Stay Calm! And be in Harmony!

Opens at 6:30 am daily to fulfilled and stop my craving for rice rolls?! And during the breakfast hour, I can get a combo for $4.99 that includes a choice of any congee and rice roll!

Congee with Chicken Slices and Mushroom ($4.99)
- I love the congee base. The thick and smooth kind that I am used to!  do think the base is the most important part of the congee

Rice Roll with Dried Shrimps ($2.99)
- It was ok. It has the chewy texture which I like. 

Food over all is 3 star. But for them to open at 6:30 am well worth that extra 0.5 star.

They also serves hot pot rice for $9 and up with a double boiled daily soup. Make sure you try their house made chili oil: taste like XO sauce and really addictive!

Definitely worth giving this place a try if you like all these traditional Cantonese style comfort food."}
