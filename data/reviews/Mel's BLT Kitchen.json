{"text":"Saw this food truck on Matthews tonight. They were closing but nice enough to make me a classic BLT with tots. The 2 guys working we're so awesome for doing that. The classic sandwich is great. Prices were reasonable considering other food trucks around. Would definitely order more to try off the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Were at 26 acres brewing a few weeks ago. Top notch chicken and waffles sliders. Cannot wait to have more.   And fabulous blt with goat cheese!!! Love. Cant wait to find them again!!"}
{"text":"Was at Resident Culture this past weekend, and this was one of the food trucks they had here. I was eying the bahn mi, but they ran out before I was hungry - bummer, but it was a daily special and it must have been delicious! I ordered the buffalo chix quesadilla meal (Cajun fries). When I ordered the gentleman told me it would take about five minutes. In that time we decided to find a table (which took longer than expected because the brewery was crazy busy!). I went back for my food and it was ready and waiting for me. The Cajun fries were amazing!! I do not like crispy fries and they were definitely perfect for me! The quesadillas had cheese, chicken, spinach and tomatoes. The ingredients were not evenly spread out and I felt like there were globs of just spinach in some bites. But the overall flavor was pretty good, and definitely a good size portion!"}
{"text":"Loved it. I had the Crispy Buttermilk Chix sandwich. A crispy, juicy chicken breast with real strips of bacon, none of that flimsy, microwaved kind either. The cajun fries were good too, nothing fancy but a tasty compliment to my sandwich. I will eat from Mel's again next time they are in the area."}
{"text":"I recently visited Mel's Blt Kitchen when I was at the jazz festival. They were out of alot of stuff, when I got there. I got the Avacado Goat Chesse Sandwich without Bacon and with Grilled Tomatoes. 

It was good, but I feel like for the price, it was not the best sandwich."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The guy that takes the orders gave my food to someone else and offered their food to me, which is not what I ordered. I asked \"what is that\" referring to what he offered me, and he said \"a burger\".I told him I wanted a what I ordered, and his actions showed that he didn't want to remake my food. However, he did. I will not be eating here again!"}
