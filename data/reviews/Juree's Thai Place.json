{"text":"Terrible service and food! Everything is super saucy and salty!!! Don't waste your money here. Definitely will not be back. Not was good as it was before."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it! My friend and I came here the other night and ordered papaya salad (medium) and red curry chicken (spicy). The papaya salad came more spicy than the curry but we were okay with that, it generally is more spicy anyways. It was delicious! The curry was a bit runnier than what I am used to but it still tasted amazing! There was enough for both of us plus I had to pack some up!   Any Thai place you go is going to be pricey but here they give you a lot of food for your money and it tastes great I will be back for sure! The service could possibly be a bit better. We waited a few minuted more than I would have liked for a waitress to come and pack up my food and re fill my water, but all in all, I will be returning here."}
{"text":"Juree's is decorated to perhaps remind you of being in Thailand, with ponds and buddhas and the like. I guess its a good reno considering it used to be an old Burger King.   The two of us arrived at about 5:45pm on a Friday, which was busy and we didn't have reservations. After a 20 minute wait we got in, which was quite decent. However, it took 15 minutes before we even saw our server, and then we had to flag her down. We started with the calamari. I found it too heavily breaded (when there's more crunchy stuff versus actual seafood), and the sauce it came with didn't compliment it well.  Our mains were the Red Curry with Chicken, and Beef Noodles and Veggies. The Red Curry had an off putting smell to it - I'm thinking it was the bamboo shoots, even though they tasted good, but it was decent enough.   The Beef Noodles and Veggies though was really well done and tasted great. I love coconut rice, so we ordered a large and it was a very large portion, however, it was super wet, and not so appealing.  We ordered dessert, which was the Thai custard. Now, I have always been known for my love of dessert, but this had zero taste and was an odd color - nothing like the picture on the menu. I had two bites and put it aside. The chef came out and saw it, and took it away and kindly offered us some coconut ice cream, which we declined - although I'm sure it would be good. They even took it off the bill, but I didn't actually expect, and was a nice gesture.  Although I had a mediocre review of this place, I think because it has so many menu items, I'd be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"I recently went here for a birthday party (8 of us in total).  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, so we all got to try a lot of their dishes. The food was terrific. Everything tasted very fresh, and the portion sizes were generous compared to other Thai restaurants. The beef satay  skewers and the tilapia were especially outstanding.  The calamari were light and crispy and delicious (and I don't normally even like calamari).  Service was prompt and friendly. I think this is my fave Thai restaurant in Calgary. It is  more suitable for large groups, since the food is served family style.  I do find it a bit surreal that the restaurant is located in an old Burger King. From the outside, it still looks a lot like a fast food joint, although the inside was completely redone.  We sat in the former kids' play area and it was a bit strange."}
{"text":"Normally I give a restaurant at least two visits before I write a review, however I really do not think that I can bring myself to go back to this place. Firstly, I am passionate about Thai cuisine, having spent a number of months travelling around Thailand. I ordered the standard cashew nut chicken for lunch which is a pretty standard Thai dish. It was extremely over salted and very very sweet. The \"Thai\" sauce that it was cooked in was closer to a Chinese sweet and sour sauce and was a big disappointment . The chicken had a crispy batter which was very chewy. On a positive note, the portion was a large and well presented, the service was fast (although they never did ask me if I wanted something to drink) and the atmosphere was very nice. The room has beautiful plants all around and the music was very relaxing. They do not accept American Express. Maybe I should give it another try but there are just too many great Thai places in the city to choose from!"}
{"text":"K"}
{"text":"2nd visit. One of the highlights of coming to Calgary!  Spring rolls, Mixed veggies, chicken curry, coconut rice and tea.  So delicious!  I took an order back to my hotel with me to have in the next day or two.  Well worth a visit, especially if you live closer than I do!"}
{"text":"The location is not really trendy, just over Home Depot on the 16th ave. NW; but it's actually a nice place to go. The service is good, the waitresses are very friendly. The restaurant has a \"traditional\" Thai decor. We have been there for dinner, and everything we had was good: soup, dumplings, Thai pad, rice curry. Efforts are made in the food presentation, which is a plus. There are a lot of options to choose from, and the quantity of food is large. The price is more than affordable for the quality and quantity of food. I recommend this place for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food Excellent service Excellent price  And last but not least, the size of the portion, wahou!"}
{"text":"Authentic and great service.  Lots of options to choose from, delicious flavours, very authentic to actual thai cuisine and the staff are genuine. Cute decor and the staff even dress up as well. Give it a try! Yes, it is in the old Burger King (lol!)."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" Thai restaurant in Calgary.  I love the red curry dish and the coconut rice.  Everything else I've eaten there was great as well.  Interesting decor and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Echoing Sabahat's sentiment, this rates somewhere between a three and four star rating.  Since the Yelp overall is 4, I'll assign my review 3 and split the difference.   The ambience is pretty good, and the decor traditional but not tired (just opened last year).  The service was decent. The regular assortment of Thai dishes, maybe slightly on the small side, but prepared a notch above par. The only other thing worth noting is that the menu does not have designated spicy dishes...it would appear that almost anything can be prepared at the spiciness level you desire."}
{"text":"I'm still looking for a tasty Thai restaurant after moving to Calgary a few months ago and I'm going to have to keep looking after eating here a few times. The stuffed chicken wings are tasty, but all of the meat dishes do not contain much meat at all and the pieces that are present are cut small and overcooked."}
{"text":"I was thinking of giving this place a 4 star mark but then realized it would be for a dumb reason. Initially hesitant to come here because I thought it was silly that they were in an old burger king building...OK my brain works differently. Anyways, once I entered I found it to be the BEST decorated Thai restaurant that I've been to in Calgary! I ordered the Panang Curry with Pork, my friend ordered the Green Curry with Chicken and we shared the Fresh Spring Rolls. The service was fantastic. I love going to the White Elephant for their shameless authenticity, but you might be waiting a while if you want to get their attention to order another beer. The pleasant waitress was certainly Thai, and dressed in traditional Thai clothes which could possibly be unnecessary, cheesy, gaudy - but I LIKED it! Do you like having an experience when you go to eat? Or do you just want to be bored and boring? The first thing I noticed about the delicious spring rolls is that they came with a tasty home made peanut sauce that was different from all of the other Thai places Ive eaten at. This made me really look forward to my meal, anticipating someone's authentic personal recipe. I was not disappointed. The Panang curry was fantastic and plentiful! I love it when I can take half of it home for another meal. Other places (except for the above mentioned Elephant) don't give you very much. Why did I almost give the place 4 stars? I was influenced by someone else's review here on yelp...yes I also found the curry was a little oilier than what I have seen elsewhere. I cook myself amazing Thai Curries at home (taught by my Thai sister in law) and do not use ANY oil apart from the natural oil in the Coconut milk. Now saying that...it is a preference! You don't tell someone what they should or shouldn't cook with when it is THEIR restaurant. That is the way they like to cook, and it's god damned delicious. Maybe you just need to run it off if you are concerned about the extra calories. SHALL RETURN I GREAT NUMBERS!!"}
{"text":"I am headed to Juree's today for their lunch buffet and am salivating already. Every time I am there (always for lunch), their buffet is stellar and floods me with memories of visiting Thailand. Some of the food is very rich but its balanced with light and refreshing options like green mango salad and yummy chili sauces. If they happen to have salad rolls out, please leave some for me - they're chock full of mint and basil and are the best in the city (oops. Meant to keep that one quiet).  Juree even promised me the crispy-fried, street-food style bananas found in Chaing Mai (that are IMPOSSIBLE to find here) if I called ahead for a meal at dinner time. Love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Thai food served quickly by friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I tried Juree's for the first time last night. My friend has been here a few times and said nothing but great things about it. We made a reservation and despite us being early, they were able to accommodate us. The decor is very tropical, which makes you feel like you are in Thailand. I loved the wall color and found it tied into the theme of the place. Hard to believe this place used to be a Burger King!  This is a very busy place. Even when we arrived at 6 pm, it was already almost to full capacity. The service is very prompt and polite. They are certainly a well oiled machine! From ordering to receiving food, we waited less than 20 minutes. Very impressive and awesome for those who are super hungry. The portions are huge! It is definitely a good value. I ordered the red curry with chicken and it had tons of veggies and chicken in it. Many places can be skimpy with ingredients, so it was nice that they gave you a hearty amount of food. My only complaint would be that the broth was very watery. It is a bit nitpicky on my part, but I like when the broth is a little thicker and it can marry well with the protein and veggies. We got some coconut rice as well for the table and it was soooo good. I'm a softie for coconut rice and this hit the spot!   Overall, it was a lovely meal and I definitely am glad I made the trip here. It is in a slightly sketchy part of town. But if you want good Thai food, give Juree's a visit."}
{"text":"The staff and ownership get an A for effort in turning a formerly pedestrian Burger King into an interesting dining spot. However, they did cut some corners in terms of the fake plant foliage and the terrible menu which looks like it was completed by a grade 6 student doing their first Word project. If you can get passed these deficiencies, then you encounter the pricing which is ok but not the best Thai value around (see my review of the Spicy Hut for that) For $15, I ordered the green curry with prawns and added the $5 order of coconut rice.  For 5 diners, our bill was just short of $100 which isn't cheap.  The food quality was very good and super tasty and offered with mild, medium or hot.  The server indicated that they could do Thai hot but I found the Hot order to provide a good blend of flavors and spiciness.  I would like to check out the buffet next as $13 is much more reasonable than the $20 or so ordering off the menu.  It should be noted that one order of the curry could have easily been shared by two people however we didn't know that at the time of ordering. Food service was quick and we were able to do lunch in 1 hr.  They are still working on their liquor license for those that like a beer or drink with your food.   Lots of free parking just off 16th ave is nice.    I think its worth checking out once, and I will be back hopefully to try the buffet.   There is a private dining area, where the playplace for Burger King used to be that was encouraged for private meetings, staff functions etc.  There has been thought and effort applied here, if they could only get their menu cleaned up and their prices a bit more competitive, they'd have a winner."}
{"text":"Am I ever going to find a decent and fresh tasting Thai restaurant in Calgary?  Hubby and I were excited to try this place after reading all of the positive reviews on Yelp. So we said, \"OK. Let's try this and find out.\" We were extremely disappointed.  The decor was good, but a little tacky. Lots and lots of fake plants, like a jungle. However, on the positive side, they did help separate tables for some additional privacy.  We both ordered different curry dishes, which were tasteless and too soupy, like Campbell's. There was way too much onion, not enough other vegetables and there was very little meat. The coconut rice also had a very weak coconut flavour.  We felt that the service and the friendliness of the owner and the staff was polite but insincere.  I would definitely not recommend this place if you're looking for good, fresh tasting Thai food.  To be completely honest, the free after dinner candy had more flavour than all of the food we paid for! I think it was mango flavoured...  Looks like we're going to try Tuk Tuk Thai next time."}
{"text":"This may be the most beautiful restaurant I've ever entered. Gorgeously painted, full of lush (fake) plants, this is definitely a great escape from the cold winter weather!   The food too, is good and filling. It's not amazing, but it counts as a 'decent' Thai restaurant in my opinion. My table ordered the Pad Thai, the Sweet and Sour stir fry, a Musluman (peanut) beef curry, and a spicy seafood stirfry, coconut rice and shrimp salad rolls.    The portions were decent, although I found my curry a bit on the skimpy side ingredients wise, with a pretty thin sauce. Definitely the first time I've EVER finished my entire meal at a Thai place, versus getting to take home yummy leftovers.   General consensus on most of the food was that, although we enjoyed what we ordered, it wasn't the best version of it that we'd ever had. The exception was the sweet and sour stirfry, which my friend finished but said she definitely wouldn't order again.   Prices seem a bit steep here vs. other Thai restaurant experiences I've had in Calgary, and the drink costs seem excessive: although you get a pretty decent sized glass, a cocktail here will cost you $10. My (virgin) mango juice was $4.50, but I'm not going to complain - it was the best mango juice I've ever had, and definitely the highlight of my meal!   All in all it was a 'okay' experience, and I'll probably visit again to try something different (and revel in the décor)."}
{"text":"A good tasty Thai restaurant near lions park C-train station. The interior design is Thai style."}
{"text":"This place was good until they they shrunk their portions.  I used to come here a lot but tonight was the last time. If your hungry dont bother eating here so not impressed. I had my birthday here so i know that they're cheaping out now. Never will i eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here on June 26th. The food was fabulous, service was excellent and we loved the decor!! I would definitely recommend Juree's!"}
{"text":"Love it here Lunch buffet small but delicious  Great staff and decor  Chicken coconut soup Yum"}
{"text":"Best Thai soups in the city as far as I'm concerned. I dream about this soup. The Tom Yum Kai and the Tom khaa Kai.  Flavorful broth, perfect balance of sweet sour salt and spice. When you dine in you get a huge bowl with a big slurping spoon. Tried to replicate these soups at home,  close but no cigar. Nothing beats the real thing.  I've tried these soups at many other Thai restaurants in town but so far none are quite as good. So definitely get the soup. The matsuman beef curry is also delicious. Great atmosphere in the restaurant too, green and lush planty vibes all around."}
{"text":"Good Thai places seem to be hard to find in Calgary. I've heard mixed reviews about Juree's so I thought I'd check it out myself.  With my sister and her bf in tow, we got the following to share: thai dumplings, green curry and pad thai.  The dumplings were really pretty - purple and flower shaped, but the filling of pork and spices were a bit underwhelming :(  The curry was good, nice mix of fresh veggies and meat in a spicy coconut broth and the pad thai was equally as good.  By no means was this the best Thai food I've had, but it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in the city. Authentic and delicious. Coconut rice is amazing."}
{"text":"Came in here for a business lunch with colleagues. One of my colleagues is Thai, so she was extra curious to come in and check out this new Thai resto.   We were all impressed by the atmosphere they pulled off here, somehow amidst all the gold and greens, this place has the ability to make you feel like you have slipped into some sort of oasis. We all mentioned how calming and relaxing this place was. There is a medium size room tucked off to the side, that would be great for a semi-private function - a more intimate dinner party, or whatever. We all went in for a look at that space and all equally loved it.  We ordered a variety of dishes, and my colleague was delighted to know that the staff and owner are Thai, she had a long conversation with the owner who really made us feel at home. We liked all of the dishes we ordered, the paneng curry and green curry were stand out dishes for us. By the end of the meal we were spooning up the last drops of these curries - just for one last taste. The owner also made a special dish for us - on account of my colleague - which was a unique fish curry, I was informed that this is a complex dish, one that is specific to the area that the owner is from and really it just showed that the owner of this place was interested in going above and beyond to make our lunch special. We loved the dish and this one was the favorite of two of my dining companions.   I agree with Adrian B., the prices are a bit steep. It's also not \"the best\" thai I've ever had, but it's good enough. I really love thai, it's up there with my favorite types of foods and half of the fun for me is trying new places and experiencing their take on how they prepare the dishes.  We left wanting to come back for the lunch buffet, it sounded like it would be really good value and a great way to experience a variety of dishes. I would say atmosphere here rules, and I will come back for a peacefull escape and decadent thai flavours."}
{"text":"I loved the decor, excellent food as well."}
{"text":"Riktigt gott stekt ris och pad thai. Vi kom dit utan några som helst förväntningar och blev mycket positivt överraskade av både hur stora portionerna var och tiden att tillaga. Vi fick ta hem resterande mat och äta hemma, men det var absolut lika gott micrat som lagat där.   Personalen var mycket hjälpsam och gav bra service.   Dessvärre kan inte samma sägas om lokalen som var prydd i både för mycket krimskrams och osmakliga möbler.   Detta är definitivt ett takeawayställe. Väldigt gott!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday on the way by. The food is absolutley delucious! The two of us had a green curry chicken and a panang beef, along side an order of coconut rice.  The meals were plated very well and were pretty good sized portions. They tasted so fresh and the sauces were very flavorful. Very traditional Thai. The food came out pretty quick as we were the first ones in the door not realizing it opened at 11. They offer a spicy scale of 1 to 5. The green curry was a 3 and the panang was a 5. And yeah the 5 is pretty spicy. The restaurant did fill up rather quickly after we came in and there was only one server. A group of a dozen or so sat behind us as the other tables filled with 2 or more. The server did not even stress out even the least. And still came around to check in on us. The only thing we noticed was the decor is a little cheezy and a bit over done. Ur kind of sitting in an artificial jungle. If they cleared it out a bit they could probably get in a few more tables. But the thought fades quickly once you have those delicious plates of food infront of you. We will surely be back to this place or even slide by for a take out when in the mood for some tasty and spicy Thai."}
{"text":"Plenty of variety of tasty thai dishes. Chickens w cashews was delicious. Thanks -  we picked mild. Deep fried spring rolls & shrimp curry were terrific. Food was warm not piping hot as expected.  Lovely atmosphere with beautiful Thai decor & golden Thai crowns.  Very busy on a Tuesday night & excellent service.  Mentioned that my friend was celebrating a birthday so waitress brought a complimentary dish of coconut icecream.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Best Thai ever!!  Could eat this everyday!!  Soooo good!! The food is always hot and fresh  And the staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in town! From food to ambient, it makes you feel as though you're in Thailand. Supreme food quality. Was told that most of their ingredients are imported from Thailand. Go for their lunch buffet if you want variety. There's performance and food sampling on Wednesday's evening too! Coconut-based Tom Yam Soup and Green Curry are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Came to Juree's last night - Sunday June 4th, approximately 7pm.  Place was busy - which is a good sign!  We got seated and greeted right away.  Service was very quick!  And friendly.  We ordered:     .....  satay chicken     .....  spring rolls (they're salad rolls though, fresh, not deep fried)     .....  won ton soup     .....  pad thai  Satay chicken and salad rolls were great!  Came with peanut sauce and another thin plum sauce of some kind.  Pad Thai was also great - I am very sensitive to spices and I could tolerate it just fine.  The BF added their hot sauce to his dish and he liked it that way.  I don't \"do\" hot sauce. lol  Did not enjoy the won ton soup though - it just wasn't what I was expecting I guess.  The broth is slightly thicker than Chinese won ton soup and the filling in the won tons was maybe too coarse - I'm not sure, just not my cup of tea perhaps.  I will definitely return.  Service was very very quick - we had 3 people dedicated to our table.  Reasonable prices, our meal was $45 + GST.  I left a huge tip.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Service is good. Coconut rice and coconut ice cream are super tasty. This restaurant would get a 5 from me however, we were told to move along after 2 hours dining because there was a time limit. We were not told this at the beginning. This has happened twice but that will be the last time. It was not cool having the next party, waiting for our table, standing by our table and waiting for us to leave. Too bad. Good food. So much for a relaxing eating experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food (lots of options on the menu) and good service. We were a group and the meals came out quickly and were very good. We sat for a long time after visiting and the servers did not rush us out. Highly recommend if you are looking for great thai food."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here for her birthday and we were both delighted with our meal. The food is fresh and deliciously prepared with fairly generous portions relative to some pricier Thai restaurants. The prices are also comparatively low.   We ordered extra to bring home for family and everyone loved the leftovers, too!  We enjoyed the basil chicken, chicken panang curry and beef green curry. The cashew chicken was more similar to its Chinese cousin, but with a Thai flare - also delicious. The stuffed chicken wings (appetizer) were very generously stuffed and flavourful.  My only suggestion to the management would be to consider a slightly expanded wine list with wines that compliment Thai foods, such as a Riesling. The wines are very reasonably priced but the selection is limited.   In terms of total value (quality, price and quantity) Juree's is one of my top 2 favourite Thai restaurants in Calgary, and a welcome addition to the Northwest Calgary restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Was taking out for dinner here for Valentine's Day what a nice little place with a theme - the servers also dress up and everything.this is my second time here. I really enjoyed the Penang curry and coconut rice too that's wonderful"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  It is getting increasingly difficult to rate restaurants in whole numbers on Yelp. There are so many places that fall just below a 4, but are better than a 3... Ah.   Anyway, I will continue.   My friend and I were were feeling under the weather so we were looking to feed ourselves some steaming hot soup to nurse ourselves back to health. My neighbourhood favourite thai place was closed, so the next nearest place to me was Juree's. Off we went, with another relatively healthy friend in tow.  Parking was easy. When we entered the restaurant, we marvelled at how nicely decorated it was. We were quickly seated. I knew what I wanted right off the bat: the hot and spicy chicken soup. My friends ordered the wonton soup and the pad thai. We asked for an appetizer of spring rolls and some tea.   The food was good. Not exceptional by any means, but slightly better than average. My friends seemed to like it a lot, but even in the midst of a runny nose and Kleenexes galore, I still happen to be a food snob when it comes to ethnic food. What can I say? I have had better Thai food. The spring rolls were rather skinny, and the pad thai was more like a pad sew. But the spicy steaming hot soup was hitting the spot. We were sick and hungry, so we just gorged and \"mmmm\"-ed with our faces in the food.   We were all quite full by the end of the meal, and when they brought us the bill, I felt victorious. With tax AND tip, we paid $43. That's less than $15 per person. For all that food - warm and comforting enough to make some sick and whiny ladies momentarily feel better - that's a bargain.   Disclaimer: If this review lacks clarity and makes no sense, its because I am still delirious and foggy-headed i.e. sick. MORE SOUP NEEDED."}
{"text":"Juree's is located in an old Burger King building - and the outside still looks like it! Don't be afraid though, for the interior will allow you to quickly forget about the Burger King esque exterior. Both the food and décor boast a very traditional Thai feel, and even when busy the service was good and the atmosphere relaxing.   During my first visit, 3 friends and I ordered the 'Dinner for 4' option, which was great value for the money - we all left stuffed, and still brought home leftovers (we also enjoyed some Thai beer, which added to the full bellies!!)! The chicken coconut-milk soup was a favorite, as was the mongo and rice dessert - shockingly good!   Vising again and ordering individual dished yielded the same tasty and generously portioned results. If you're looking for good traditional Thai food in a nice atmosphere, Juree is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Always a favourite for Thai food. Whenever in the area we do try to visit here. Great quality, great taste, good portions."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a decent environment. When you get in, you can feel the Thai decorations. And the food here are really good. I like the deep fried fish, their papaya salad. The fresh sour salad will open taste bud. The price is nice. A good restaurant to try if you are looking for fine dinning and exotic flavours."}
{"text":"Was in town on business, and went looking for a Thai place, and this is it!  Yes, it was an old Burger King, from other reviews, but the decor is very tastefully done, and lent a nice atmosphere to the interior. Plenty of parking out front too.  I tried the stuffed chicken wings, and I don't know how they stuff a chicken wing, but they are delicious. The presentation was also very nice.  Went with the Pad Thai, hot, and asked them to bring extra sauce to the table, so I could add as needed. The Pad Thai was very tasty, was almost enough for two, after the stuffed chicken wings.  I will recommend this place to my co-workers for sure."}
{"text":"I have had better thai food at thai express sadly. Apart from china wear ambiance tahi music and the thai waitresess nithings authentic. Your food will be loaded with .5 kilos of carrot garnish. Unless you have a sweet tooth i would suggest going to some other restaurant. One good thing for single guys, the waitresess are gorgeous. Alas you only meet her maybe for 2 mins to take ur order and the bill."}
{"text":"We took guests to Juree's and were treated to as usual an excellent meal with  great assistance from our waitress in our ordering. Our guests were still raving about the meal the next day. \"The best Thai food they had ever had\". Everything was served promptly and tasted and looked so fresh. Great experience."}
{"text":"The service was very good. friendly and prompt.  The food was really disappointing.  spring rolls (average) Pretty tasty but nothing to write home about. They were your standard Thai spring roll.  Masaman beef curry (awful) The curry was a flavourless brown broth with tough, gristly slices of beef, loads of onions and a few chunks of potatoes. The potatoes were good, but they were pretty sparse. The beef was truly the worst part of the dish. It was dry, tough and a fair bit of it got chewed up and spit out on account of the way-beyond-acceptable amount of gristle in it. The broth (curry?) tasted ok after I added a bunch of soy sauce, peanut sauce and a touch of sriracha - but I certainly expected more.  mixed veggie stir fry (awful) The sauce was a flavourless demonstration of oil and water not mixing. The red and green peppers were crisp and tasty, but for the most part this was pretty disappointing too.  Pad tai (average) This was so-so. It was kind of dried out and lacked seasoning, but it wasn't the worst I've had. Unfortunately that's the best I can say about it.  coconut rice (very good) This was very good. Nice and sticky and a really nice coconut flavour.   This all cost $56, which I guess is cheaper than some other Thai spots in town, and the portions were somewhat larger.  That being said, is a bigger portion really a better value if the food itself isn't very good?  I don't think we'll be returning to Juree's."}
{"text":"Food was delicious,  I especially enjoyed the coconut soup with chicken and the pad thai.  Service was great,  very attentive and the staff knowledgeable and not afraid to make recommendations."}
{"text":"Very good thai food in Calgary! Had the green curry, masaman curry with coconut rice and all was excellent. Had the mango coconut rice for dessert. I have spent some time in thailand and the food was quite good. Hard to come by the exact ingredients for many of these dishes  but they do a great job. Flavours of the curry were excellent. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very nice decor and amazing food presentation. Service is good. My first time having authentic thai so it was too scented flavour for me.  Very high end restaurant feeling."}
{"text":"We went here and were not disappointed. The menu is varied and will transport you to Thai beaches and palm trees, as does the interior decor in this somewhat crowded venue. Try it and see if the flavours zing off your tongue like ours. Please make reservations ahead of time?  But if you want a romantic connection, is quite noisy and thus marginal. Will go back and enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome Tia food.  Never been disappointed.  Coconut rice is a must everytime we go.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service! some of the best thai i've ever had"}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand many times and my favorite curry was always massaman curry. We ordered it and I must say it is so authentic! !  The ginger beef was also amazing and the flavours just really flowed together. We got a large pot of coconut rice and probably finished half of it (and took the rest home of course). Prices are very decent for the dishes and the service was very good.  We will totally be coming back here on a monthly basis!"}
{"text":"Wow.....unbelievable food and incredible service! Two things that are tough to find nowadays in Calgary.  Juree's is an absolute must try."}
{"text":"Juree's is pretty tasty Thai in a nice room, especially if you love artificial plants.  If you're in the hood and in need of some Thai, Juree's is pretty darn good! The atmosphere is peaceful and there are enough artificial plants to give you a decently private dining experience.  I stopped in for the lunch buffet that runs Wednesday - Friday from 11am - 1pm. I'd imagine the menu changes, but for $13.50 you get your unlimited pick of a couple different curries and rice, pan fried fish cakes, a couple different salads including this scrumptious spicy pineapple one, and desert. I showed up close to the end of buffet time and everything was pretty good, but I wound up in my usual buffet conundrum. I just can't eat enough mediocre buffet food to make it worth the price.  Other tables food came out quickly and looked delicious, and here I was scraping the bottom of buffet bins. If you're the kind of person that is usually satisfied with the portion of food you receive at a restaurant, I'd recommend bypassing the buffet. If you're in a rush and need to stuff you face, by all means, hit it up!  The standout buffet item to me was this creamy, sweet desert that tasted like a warm pudding concoction of coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk, loaded with root vegetables what I think was sweet potatoes, taro root, and something else I can't even come close to naming. LIke with most buffet items it was pretty easy to get over zealous with the quantity, and this stuff is filling!  I'd love to give Juree's another shot and this time miss out on the buffet.  My longing for a great Thai restaurant with takeout within a 10 minute walk from my house warrants some further investigation. Until next time, Jure's is A-OK."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I've tried this place even after having lived in the area for over 3 years. The food tasted great and the service was good as well. The portions were large enough to make us feel that we should have split an appetizer and one main between the two of us. They definitely are flavourful and worth going to again.   I found it a little odd that they had a TV next to where we were sitting that was showing what seemed to be advertisement for Thailand. It wasn't unpleasant but seemed out of place."}
{"text":"My dine in experience was enjoyable with fast and friendly service. I've only come to Juree's once for dinner but I've had take out a few times and enjoyed every meal so far. I recommend the Thai Green Curry (had it twice now) but I don't think you can go wrong with any dish on the menu.  Maybe stay away from the $18 shared appetizer dish actually - my friend, Seano, bought it and it was definitely not worth $18"}
{"text":"If you like Thai Food then you should check out Juree's. It's located at the small mall just west  of North Hill Shopping Centre. There's a bank, Second Cup and Liquor Store located there as well. There's lots of parking. I've been there a few times. I don't recommend the calamari. It was rubbery the last time I had it. I do like the special Fish with Tamarind Sauce as well as the Fish with Chili Sauce. The Tom Yum soups are nice and tangy without being overpowered with lemongrass. It's a nice place and noise levels are conducive to good conversations while enjoying a good meal."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! Excellent place for dinner with family and I believe that they do lunch buffet on Wed, Thurs and Fri. I really recommend this place for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great place for thai curry! They will  ask how spicy you would like it, and you will get what you ask for. I like it hot! And it's hot every time! The decor sets an excellent feng shui that delivers a truly exotic dining experience."}
{"text":"I think that Juree's Thai Place is one of the better Thai restaurants in Calgary. I have tried a couple other places and never felt fully satisfied at a price much higher than here. I think the pricing here is fair, and I have heard good things about their lunch buffets as well.  My boyfriend and I love the matsaman curry from here, with the chicken added. We get the large coconut rice with it and we always have leftovers to take home for next day's lunch. The coconut rice is quite rich and heavy - depending on preference, it might be a bit too much. We love it, especially with the curry - I think that it goes very well together. For the curry ($13.00) and large coconut rice ($6.00), our bill is less than $20 (not including tip)!! Amazing for the quality AND quantity.   We've tried the pad thai here but wasn't wowed by it - we have had better. It seems a little bit too oily for our liking. We also tried the cashew chicken as we read many great reviews and found that it was okay, but again nothing amazing. I like that you can pick how spicy you want your dish to be. We usually get medium, but it's not that spicy (and I am not very good at handling spicy food) so I think if you are a spicy food lover, you should get something above medium.  They are very prompt with take outs. I call ahead about 15-20 minutes and when I get there, everything is packed securely and ready to go. I don't know if the lady that I've seen most of the time there is the owner, but she is very friendly.  I like the parking here because it's easy and I never have any troubles finding a spot. Also, the inside of the restaurant is beautiful - very nicely decorated! All the bowls and plates that they use are also very pretty I think.  I think if you are having a craving for Thai food, you should give this place a try :)  *I want to give this place a 4.5/5 because I have had better Thai food outside of Calgary but since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I have edited my rating for this place to a 5 because I don't want to deter anyone from trying this place!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Thai basil chicken, crispy Thai fish, massaman curry are a few of my go to entrees here. Ask for Thai spicy if you're like me and need the extra kick of heat. Service is always good and setting is extremely authentic. It used to be a Burger King but they have dressed it up enough that you don't notice."}
{"text":"Decent. I feel that it is one of the better Thai places I've been. Randomly looked up Thai food and found this.  The great thing is they don't close in the afternoon, so you can always get your fix.    The decor is out of this world.   Transports me back to my month in Thailand.    The portions come in smaller sizes but can be shared.  I suggest splurging and sharing multiple dishes.   They have a lunch buffet from 11-2 Wednesday - Friday.   The music is authentic.   Very enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.   I love me some Thai food.  I've been to Juree's several occasions now. It brings my taste buds and stomach such happy memories to write this review!   Atmosphere: I think I heard that this place used to be a McDonalds or Burger King? Ha, both times I've eaten here, I got sat in the old Play place. That aside: when you walk into a Juree's, you walk into a bodacious forest of fake greens. The restaurant has a traditional Thai setting (in my opinion), decorations included and was pretty comfortable.   Service: Every time I come, I'm always given good service. From the looks of it, it seems to be a family run restaurant!  Food: I've never been to their lunch buffet, but their dinner is delicious! They have quite the menu to choose from, and everything I have had was tasty!   Must haves: you must have their specialty tamarind fish. It is so good! Perfectly crispy on the outside, a beautiful flakey inside and accompanied with a scrumptious sauce. Their coconut rice is also on par.   This is my go-to Thai place! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Its a wonderful Thai restaurant in Calgary so far. Food are amazing , friendly staff , nice and beautiful decorations and If you go there on Wednesday , the restaurant has a Thai Traditional dancing show as well."}
{"text":"Don't do it! Looks like a great Thai restaurant but looks are deceiving!   Food just wasn't that good. Had noodles with shrimp, noodles weren't cooked all the way and stuck together. Shrimp tasted old and frozen. I was expecting so much better flavor and service.   If you like overpriced and subpar food in the same sitting...then this is your place."}
{"text":"The food is okay and the service seemed rushed, like they wanted us to dine and pay quickly to get the next group in.  I definitely think the seasoning and quality at Khao San Thai is better, better quality.  We had the Thai dumpling at both places and the dumpling at this place was falling apart because it was crumbly, and doesn't have that slight chewy texture you're expecting.  The green curry was not flavourful at all, and barely had any protein, this was the case for all the dishes.  I haven't been able to find a really good Thai place in Calgary.  My fav is still in Seattle."}
{"text":"Very authentic food, great service. Pricing is a little on the steep side but the portions are generous and the staff are all authentically Thai and knowledgeable about the food.  Traditional Thai decor all around including videos of Thailand playing in the background to give you the full Thai experience.   The place trends to get very busy so it's best to call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Wow, was really impressed by food and service.  We had the coconut rice, green papaya salad, Pad Thai and Squid with Basil.  Portions were good, the sweet Pad Thai was amazing, very flavorful.  The green papaya salad was good (not as citrusy as I like), and the shrimps were tender and tasty.  The squid had surprising mild undertones of licorice (maybe fennel?) and accented the squid.   Service was good, the table for 2 was a bit on the small side, not enough room for plates. Thought the meal was exceptional.  Want to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Snow is falling, wind is blowing...a trip to Thailand is in order!  Or at least a 'reasonably produced facsimile' in a Calgary strip mall.    What we loved:  The appetizer platter {Spring rolls, tender beef satay, chicken wings, squid}!  I am still trying to figure out how they stuff the chicken wings.  The three sauces were tasty and each appy was delicious.  The coconut rice?  Soft, creamy and the coconut sang on our taste buds.  The authentic uniforms are gorgeous.  The decor is calming and tropical.  What we weren't as in love with:  I didn't like my drink.  The coconut it came in was delicious and the flesh soft.  But, the drink itself had a taste I didn't enjoy.  My friend told me at the end of the meal that his rye and coke was = a coke.  A fact confirmed when the server asked him if he wanted another Pepsi.  The potatoes in the curry were not cooked and the prawns were a bit less in amount than I would have wished.  That being said, it was a dish we had requested with prawns in lieu of other meat and the server was very accommodating.  I am really undecided about the Gai Lan with Crispy Pork.  From the name we were expecting \"crispy\" like KFC is crispy chicken.  Instead the meat was \"cartilage\" in texture and soft and neither of us were jumping for joy.  However, I had the leftovers as a midnight snack - cold - and they were DELICIOUS.  Balanced layers of salty and sweet.  Thus, I reserve judgment.  Service is friendly and mostly efficient.  The atmosphere is a win.  I would return for the coconut rice and appetizer platter alone.  Dinner and drink (s) came to approximately $64 (before tip).  Thai one on at Juree's!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant. The waitresses wear traditional Thai dresses and are very pleasant. On the other hand, the food isn't that good. They cheap out on some key ingredients. I detected maybe 5 grams of lemongrass in my Green Curry and minuscule amounts of galangal in the Tom Yum.   It's important to know they actually mean it when they say something is spicy. If you order the \"Thai spicy,\" you'd better be prepared for a challenge!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time (take out only).  Been searching for fresh salad rolls since the King and I closed down. KAI had THE BEST salad rolls in town and it was a DEAL (6 for $12) and REAL peanut sauce.  I digress...anyhoo...back to Juree's.  Four salad rolls for $12, loosely wrapped so a bit messy.  Tiny portions of fish sauce (barely enough for two salad rolls, let alone four) and the WORST \"peanut sauce\" (not even mixed with coconut milk for proper dipping consistency).  The coconut rice was weak in the coconut flavour department.  The green veg curry was so watered down and contained way too many green peppers for my liking.  Once again we realized we can make better curry at home with Thai Kitchen curry paste and premium canned coconut milk.  White Elephant still good choice but too far from home.  Thai Chili Club still best for us for location and quality but getting way too expensive (and for some reason their salad rolls badly suck while everything else is amazing)."}
{"text":"There is one problem that I want to make sure my fellow Yelper's do not encounter when they go to this great place. There is no access from 16th Avenue westbound, you must turn left at 19th Street NW and enter the parking lot just past the bank, due to the median. I think that the buffet is the best there is, as they are constantly bringing nice freshly made food from the kitchen, instead of holding large quantities in the warming pans like many places do. This was my experience with the prices for the dishes I had off the regular menu in th evening. I ordered their steamed sour and spicy fish dish for $16, because to me to not have a Thai fish dish is missing out of one of the best Thai foods there is. I simply love how they prepare fish. I think it was the most expensive item on the menu and it was very well prepared and tasty. The red and green vegetarian dishes were $13 and were as good as anything I have had in Calgary."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 3 stars but was turned off by the service the moment we walked in. We arrived at 9:08 and 2 servers saw us and spoke in their language. It took them awhile to come to us and one of them said: \"our kitchen will close in 15 mins and we will close at 10 (which was a little less than an hour). Is that enough time for you?\" She was kinda expecting i'd say no, but because i was craving for rice and there are not much choices where we were staying, i said it was fine. We were seated but then no one came to the table to get our orders. I would assume they should have since they know we only have a limited time before the kitchen closes. I had to get the attention of one of the servers to place our order. Around 9:45, the aame server kept looking at our table and obviously checking if we're done, to think that there were a few tables with people still eating who were there before us. Food was good though, i cant complain. We had the spicy noodles and the seafood with basil. Both were equally good. Pricewise, this was a bit overpriced compared to regular thai restos. $16 for the seafood and $13 for the noodles which is not a generous serving. I guess you pay for the pleasant decor. Overall I was very pleased with the quality of food, but the indifferent service says otherwise. I will try other establishments who will be happy to get my business."}
{"text":"Warm friendly service, delicious food (we tried pad Thai with prawns, stir-fried gai lan with crispy pork, panang beef curry, coconut rice, and spring rolls). Great ambiance. I plan to come back to try the weekday buffet."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our evening at Juree's Thai Place.  The dishes were delicious and not too expensive.  We enjoyed choosing our level of spice for each dish.  This is perfect for groups of people who enjoy anything from bland to extra spicy."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and my friends and I really loved our experience. The restaurant has really great decor with decorative trees, flowers and a fish tank. The servers also dress up in traditional Thai outfits which really adds to your Thai food experience. The statues, pictures of the Thailand as well as the videos of Thailand playing on the TV screens made me really miss Thailand!   We ordered beef satay skewers ($12), red chicken curry ($13), Gai lan with crispy pork ($13), and spicy noodle with prawn ($13) along with a bowl of large coconut rice. The prices were really good for the amount of food we got.   The beef skewers came with a side of bread and two different sauces - peanut satay sauce and sweet chilli. The beef was really soft and flavourful and fell off the skewer really easily! Loved this as an appetizer. The red chicken curry came with red and green peppers, basil and bamboo shoots and it was a great combination. We got to pick the spice level for the curries and the noodles as well which was really great as everyone had a different spice tolerance! Their Gai lan and spicy noodle was yummy too! Its a lot of food so we had to take some home!   One of my friends forgot her packed food inside the restaurant and the server ran out into the parking lot to give it to her - thats the kind of awesome service that I'm talking about! Really loved eating here! Would totally recommend"}
{"text":"Can you believe that this place used to be a Burger King? Mind blown.  It was pretty busy for an early Friday evening; there was a constant flow of people coming in and out to grab takeout. The inside is lush and relaxing with green walls, fish tanks and Thai music videos playing in the background.  - Coconut rice (#64) ($6.00 large) - fluffy and aromatic. Large was perfect amount to share between three. - Matsaman curry with beef (#27) ($15.00) - I haven't enjoyed a matsaman curry in a long time but this one was great. We only got it \"mild spicy\"; the flavours were well balanced and harmonious. - Green curry (#24) ($15.00) - green curry was also well executed and had a bit more heat to it than the matsaman. - Pad thai (#54) ($15.00) - According to K, whose been here multiple times, the pad thai is usually awesome but something was off this time around. I thought the noodles were pretty lumpy and didn't have much spring to them. Just passable.  Tough to say how it matches up against White Elephant as I've only been once to both places but our meal at JT was solid enough."}
{"text":"Everything is a soup, it doesn't come with rice, its way over priced for what you get. If you're going to do a different take on curry, you should probably want people that you've turned it into a soup."}
{"text":"This was a nice find. The service was friendly and fast. The flavors were good with fresh ingredients. Authentic traditional Thai food in a very beautiful relaxed atmosphere. Lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai! Love the coconut rice too!"}
{"text":"We had an event that we were attending so we didn't have a chance to grab dinner until after 8pm.  Juree's is open later so it was perfect.  We love spicy food and we love that Juree's is one of the few Thai restaurants in the city that will make your food \"Thai Spicy\"   This is the authentic spicy; like burn your tongue if you're not used to it. We ordered the papaya salad, basil with chicken, penang curry with chicken, Jurees special tamarind fish and a fried rice.  Everything came out very promptly and everything was very flavourful.  The portion sizes are a little bit smaller then other Thai restaurants but we like the location and that it opens late.  The Jurees special tamarind fish is a must have if you enjoy fish. it is deep fried in battle and they cover it in a delicious tamarind sauce.  We've also gotten it as takeout before and it was still very good. This restaurant is always busy.  They also have a lunch buffet which I will have to try one day."}
{"text":"This place was on my eat list and the gf needed an idea for her bday dinner. We went as a large group and they were able to accommodate by putting several tables together for us. The service was great which is especially impressive since it's an Asian restaurant.   We started with the Thai dumplings, they were quite bland, the skin was doughy and there wasn't enough filling. Not sure how authentic they are since I've never had anything similar but I prefer Chinese or Japanese dumplings. They did look very nice and intricate.   I got the bday girl a coconut drink with a lot of other stuff including booze. It tasted great and couldn't even detect any alcohol. They couldn't completely fit the drink into the coconut so they poured the rest into a shot glass for us.   For soup we got the prawn coconut soup. We found the taste to be overwhelmingly fish sauce-y.   We got the massaman beef curry and had it with coconut rice. The curry was also very fish sauce-y and the coconut rice was not mixed properly and lacked fragrance. We also disliked the texture of the rice since it was a bit on the mushy side.   Finally we had pad Thai which we agreed was the best dish by far. It was very tasty and the noodles were cooked perfectly and the ingredients were in great harmony with the salty, sour, sweet and spice playing together.   In conclusion, I would likely not recommend jurees. Their service was great and the noodles were great. However I far prefer the food at white elephant if you are willing to wait and suffer poor service. The value at white elephant is also much greater (especially the curries)."}
{"text":"Friendly service, very bland food and way overpriced.  Maybe because I live in the US, but it was definitely some of the worst Thai I've had and I've paid half the price for WAY better food."}
{"text":"Do Juree's for take-out. On my last visit here, the food was quite good, but it took an arm and a leg length's worth of time to get to us. They also forgot to put in my order for jasmine tea-and subsequently brought me green tea... 45 minutes after we flagged down a server inquiry about our beverages has nobody had been by to check on our table... in a near empty restaurant.  Like I said... take-out. And then, maybe phone it in first."}
{"text":"Had a very tasty family dinner here. Arrived at 7pm on a Friday and it was quite busy inside. We were seated quickly and ordered spring rolls to start. Loved they were served piping hot from the deep fryer and not lukewarm from a hot plate.  Next up, matsuman curry beef, house special tamarind fish, spicy vegetarian noodles, and gai lab with crispy pork. Enjoyed all of it. The beef was a bit chewy and skimpy but the sauce was lovely with fresh whole peanuts and chunks of potatoes. We asked the noodles to be spicy hot and they definitely made our nose sweat! You can ask for your heat level which is nice. Tamarind fish was our fave! Crispy batter in a sticky sweet sauce. Gai lan was a bit heavy on the garlic for my family but I did not mind. The crispy pork was different with a sweet crunch almost as if it was dredged in brown sugar and fried up. Our total bill was $88. Not including tip. We also had coke and tea with our meal.  Considering how hard it is to find good Thai food in this city, I enjoyed the service, ambience and food. A solid 4 stars for this place."}
{"text":"We are eating dinner right now waiting for dessert and I want to already write a review of how amazing it is here. The food is excellent. I've been to Thailand and this is as authentic as it gets. We had the dinner for the 3 option and added papaya salad. Every dish was flavorful and felt like it was made with love and care. However, what made this restaurant stand out to me is the service. The servers here are so thorough and attentive and made such considerate accommodations to our dishes based on our group's needs. My sister and I wanted to share the Thai iced tea and the server overheard and she split it into two glasses for us even though we never even thought any restaurant would do that.  It's the service that is definitely the highlight."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Juree's Thai is decorated as your typical North American, sit-down, semi-upscale Thai restaurant (dark colours, exorbitant decorations, rounded edges and a token fish tank upon entrance). That being said, the décor/atmosphere does not feel cheap - you'll be fine to enjoy this restaurant as a special outing with the family (without feeling like you're in a fast-food Thai/Asian restaurant). Dress code (although not enforced), seems to be somewhere between comfortable and business casual.   Staff and service: Staff were friendly, service was quick.  Food and drink: tl;dr, Juree's Thai served some of the best green curry/coconut rice I have ever tried. I ordered the Thai fresh rolls (see attached picture), vegetarian green curry and a side of coconut rice - all portions were large (enough to bring spares for lunch the next day) and everything was fresh and tasted great. Menu items are reasonably priced and suitable for sharing.  Overall impression: Juree's Thai is an excellent and affordable option for a private dinner, date night or the entire family (or take-out!) - don't miss out on the veg. green curry or coconut rice."}
{"text":"We came as a large group, over 20 of us and were seating in a private room which I liked.  The menu was set in advance with various dishes to be shared by all.  I liked there was a variety to meet the needs everyone; vegetarians, those who can't eat spicy foods, and lactose intolerant.  The first item to come out were salad rolls, although they may have a different name for them.  It was rice paper wrapped around rice noodle, vegetables and shrimp, and served with peanut sauce and fish sauce.  They were light and tasty with the peanut sauce.  Next items included pad thai, curry with prawns, vegetarian curry, and another dish I can't recall.  The coconut rice served was amazing and delicious.  For dessert, ice cream was served.    The food came out consistently and there wasn't long waits in between dishes.  The servers were accommodating to drink orders and additional requests for dishes.  I was pleased with the whole experience and enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Having lived in Asia for several years, I really miss good Asian food. A neighbor told us about this place, and best of all it's only a few blocks from our house. Uphill the entire way unfortunately. But it was worth the trek! This is some of the best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. I had a green chicken curry and wife had beef and vegetable dish. The food was all aromatic and flavorful, perfectly cooked and well-presented. The coconut rice is phenom! The restaurant itself has a lovely atmosphere, with a Buddha shrine just like you'd find in most places of business in Thailand. I knocked off a star because the service was really slow, even after the restaurant cleared out. Seemed like only two girls were working the entire restaurant; one of the waitresses complained that everyone had called in sick that day and it was super busy even for a Sunday night. Also I thought the price is high but then, everything is in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have had Juree's Thai on my list of restaurants to visit, so figured after a 13 mile run this would be a great treat! I got Spicy Prawn Noodles and Green Vegetable Curry in medium/spicy for take out. I was sadly very disappointed in the food. The Green Vegetable Curry had a layer of oil on top (almost 5 tablespoons worth) that I had to discard and then used a paper towel to soak up the rest of the oil. The Noodles were ok, the quality of vegetables were good at least. For the price of the dish, I expected a better quality prawn - essentially tiny shrimp. The dining atmosphere seems nice but maybe because it's dim in there you don't notice all the oil in the dish or it's mixed in so well? The dish was not really spicy at all, I've had better Thai curry dishes with more flavor. I do not plan on going back to this restaurant as the quality and price do not match up and amount of oil that I found in the Curry dish was disgusting."}
{"text":"Delicious every time! Make a reservation because even on weeknights this place is packed! Authentic, delicious, and fun atmosphere. The staff go out of their way to make things enjoyable by offering to take group photos and asking what you're there to celebrate. Free coconut ice cream for a birthday was a pleasant surprise. This is a definite go to for Thai in the city!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  We ordered the dinner for four for five people with the addition of a Tom yum soup and another curry. The décor of the restaurant is splendid and the waitresses are beautiful in their traditional clothes. Lots of groups and couples there for dinner, luckily we made a reservation as it was quite busy on a Friday night.   Everything is absolutely delicious, the appetizer platter is exquisite with their stuffed chicken wings, calamari, skewers and spring rolls. Plating is beautiful. The curries were amazing as well; I'm partial to the green curry over the red. Pad Thai is to die for. We also got a fresh fish instead of the fillets which tasted great, but be careful of bones!  The vegetable dish was great as well. Either dessert is fresh and yummy!  For the price, you won't get a better Thai meal that's for sure. It came out to less than $30 per person plus tip and we were all thoroughly satisfied!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the corner of a plaza the restaurant is a former fast food place cleverly converted into a Thai restaurant. The layout and decor is sumptuous and beautiful creating the feeling of actually being in Thailand without feeling too Disney like or being too kitsch. All the tables are laid out so you have a feeling of being in a private space. After so many restaurants cramming together tables NYC style so you are bumping elbows with the person beside you it is a pleasant change, creating an intimate dining experience.   The staff all decked out in beautiful Thai outfits is friendly, polite and accommodating to everyone's needs. The menu features a good selection of Thai dishes, including some beautiful tiny purple flower appetizers. We had a selection of different curries and pad Thai and the food was everything one would expect from a good Thai restaurant. Not to be missed for any one craving Thai food in Calgary."}
{"text":"Juree's Thai Place Restaurant opened not too long ago in the spot where Burger King once stood.  The restaurant is completely renovated with a lovely serene atmosphere of calming greens and browns.  It feels like you are sitting in a garden with all the tropical plants (some fake, mind you).  Very interesting Thai knick-knacks are decorated throughout the restaurant.   To add to the ambience of the restaurant, the waitresses wear the traditional colourful Silk Thai garments.  Free parking in front of the restaurant.  Now, on to the food - very good Thai good but on the pricey side.  A must-have appetizer is the Stuffed Chicken Wings.  Gosh, cooked to perfection and comes with 2 sauces - a peanut sauce and a sweet sauce.  4 Stuffed Chicken Wings per order.  We opted to have the Dinner for 4 that came to $85.00 with some choices.  The waitress will ask what type of heat you can take.  We liked Medium heat. We chose the Chicken with Coconut Milk Soup.  That was a tasty coconuty soup with lemongrass and galangal and with just the right amout of spice!  Next, we picked the Red Curry with Beef.  The beef was a little overcooked but the sauce was great with lots of vegetables.  This next dish we had was the Stir Fried Mixed Vegetables with Prawns.  Seems the prawns is a much better deal.  Prawns were well prepared. Seafood With Basil - the basil adds a whole different layer of flavours to this seafood dish.  Thai Fried Noodles or Pad Thai - very nicely done.  We opted for the Coconut Rice - it seems small but the rice and noodles really are enough for 4 people.  Dessert was the best part -  2 Sticky Rice with Mango - a warm dessert but oh, so good! and 2 Coconut Icecreams.  If you like to kick it up a notch, ask for hot sauce and add it to the noodles or to the stir-fried dishes.  Yum!  Also found out that they have a lunch buffet on Wed, Thu, and Fri for $12.95/person.    Will be back for more!   _____________________________________________________  Went back for their buffet - a taste of Thailand in a buffet - came with white rice, salad rolls cut into halves and eaten with peanut sauce, deep-fried wontons, coconut shrimp soup, mixed vege curry, chicken in red curry, noodles, a most delicious Thai coconut dessert soup and fresh cut fruit.    Not too bad a deal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for their awesome food. Ambiance is great but it gets a little cozy. The staff is very friendly and I want to go there again!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai cuisine, the service can be a little on the slow side.  That is easily made up for by the absolutely fabulous food. I highly recommend this place is you are looking for a nice romantic dinner. Albeit a not so quick one."}
{"text":"I saw on a facebook feed that the owner is working to make Vegan options so my partner and I decided to give it a try.  We looked at the menu and only saw a few items that would work and before getting upset about it I said let's wait and speak to the waiter.  I asked which items are Vegan as I had heard there were some..and he told me that anything on the menu can be Veganized!!!!!!!!  Thrilled beyond!  The items we ordered were amazing and it's such a relief to go somewhere and not have to explain all the in's and out's of Vegan and quizzing them as to ingredients!!!!"}
