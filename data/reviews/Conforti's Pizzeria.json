{"text":"Our favorite pizza in the world, so far. We order the pepperoni, but my dad swears by a plain cheese, not extra. Order a medium for the right ratio of crust to toppings. I eat the crust first, like a breadstick. I love the family that owns Conforti's and enjoy dining in the cozy place.  We always bring one back to DC when we visit family in North Huntington. It freezes and reheats well, even in the microwave. Probably better to reheat in the oven, but we're not that patient."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place.  The pizza and hoagies are delicious!  We used to drive to Beechview for great pizza but since trying Confortis we no longer have to.  It's very neat and clean inside and the owners and staff are very nice and courteous.  Highly recommend this place for sit down or take out"}
{"text":"When back home visiting in Irwin we always order a par baked large everything but pizza to take home with us. Have loved the pizza for years and look forward to it every visit back .. however this time we were dismayed when we got home to Maryland and unwrapped it ... it's no longer the huge misshapen oval pizza but instead a smaller round pizza now. Still good  but for approx $38 it is definitely not worth the price now"}
{"text":"This is one case where there was way too much pepperoni on the pizza and I like pepperoni. I couldn't taste anything else. I ate part of the second piece and threw the rest of the pizza away. It was also $17 for a small pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. A small is pretty good size but that's pretty pricey"}
{"text":"I had a \"mini\" sausage hoagie and the size of the sausage patty was very generous, basically the size of two burger patties.  It tasted great and they put just a small amount of cheese on it for me like I asked.  My husband got a half sized chicken parmesan hoagie.  Again, lots of meat!  In his case, a ton of cheese as well.  He took half of his hoagie home because it's gigantic.  Pleasant staff and nice, quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pizza spots. Everything is fresh, tons of toppings on the pizzas. Pizzas are huge & loaded with toppings so you may want to order a size smaller than usual. They also have great subs, once again, don't order too big because they are huge..& delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza hands down! Dont let the name fool you. It's the same fantastic recipe as Vincent's in Forest Hills...a.k.a the undefeated king of Pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is some of the worst I've ever had. Ordered a medium cheese and medium pepperoni/ham for take out.   The cheese pizza wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. Had no flavor and hardly any sauce. It was way too greasy for being just cheese.  The pepperoni/ham was absolutely awful. There was hardly any sauce on it. The ham looks like it's sliced for lunchmeat. The pizza was so greasy they had to put two cardboard bases under it because was soaking through the first. The ENTIRE bottom of the pizza was mush from laying in grease.   I guess if there was any positive, it was the thick crust. For $37 I would've thought the pizza would've been somewhat decent. And for the people leaving 5 star reviews raving it's the best pizza they've ever had, they've obviously never had good pizza."}
{"text":"Try the Italian Hoagie it's huge it's delicious and it feeds a family of 4-5. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around. You definitely get your money's worth with the toppings. This is not like your typical pizza, they really pile on the cheese and toppings - 2 pieces and I am stuffed! Service is always very friendly and quick, regardless of if you are dining in or just picking up.  I always mean to try their other menu items, but I just can't get away from the pizza!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had in my life Never fails to disappoint! Love the freshness of the crust,the pepperoni, and cheesy goodness! Don't use salt on it as its salty enough with all the pepperoni on it.But bland pizza to me always requires salt .This pizza reminds me of deep dish pizza I had in Chicago. So sorry to hear of Mr.Conforti 's passing ad he will be sadly missed."}
{"text":"Comforti's pizza is excellent and non traditional.  Stemming from Vincent's Pizza park style, it's an experience all it's own. The pizza is large, full of toppings with a massive fresh crust. Plan to use a knife and fork, you won't be disappointed.  Take out is always a good option."}
{"text":"Pizza was loaded with ingredients and perfectly distributed which was excellent, crust was a bit soggy for my liking however overall it tasted good. Hoagie served on Italian loaf of bread filled!  Definitely get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"The best pizza around! The crust is fantastic, the toppings are SO plentiful! The flavor of the sauce is fantastic! One of the areas best kept secrets!"}
{"text":"There take on pizza is overwhelming. They load the huge greasy pizza with a plethora topping (whichever kind you ask for) and wrap this monster of a pizza in a larger thick piece of paper (for take out). I like the pizza every now and then. When we buy it I end up eating one or two slices because of the size of the pizza, whereas I normally eat 4-5 pieces of other pizza. Also, their pizza is very greasy, so too much of it makes me sick. I have only tried there pizza, and have only bought take out in the past. I am unsure of what the inside of their restaurant looks like and the other items on their menu and how they taste. This is not my favorite pizza, and not my go to pizza, but I am a slight fan of it every now and then."}
{"text":"This is the for real Pizza place around. Not a great place to try and impress a date but the place with a true Chicago. New York type taste  from yesterday..Its greasy because they use real fresh meat toppings and the crust is made by recipe that day. Compare to this other local places it's so much more old style rather than the fast food little stands we see popping up. Its my favorite and I'm a pizza guru lol...."}
{"text":"An 8 cut is HUGE! Fluffy crust and very cheesy! If you get toppings your definitely not going to be disappointed because they load up on toppings. Delicious food definitely looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I grew up 1 mile from the original Vincents Pizza on Ardmore Blvd.   Joe Conforti was trained by Vince himself and still makes the same great pizza from the same great ingredients and suppliers that Vince always used.  And he's been in busness for almost 30 years.  Now Joe's son runs the business.   I've eaten at Vincents in Plum Boro as well.   Conforti's is as authentic a Vinnie Pie as either of the other 2 locations.   Just as good.   Anybody who says otherwise is full of it."}
{"text":"The pizzas are huge, and worth every penny they ask for.  They aren't excessively greasy, the toppings are fresher and just better than literally any other pizza place I've ever been to in my life.  I'd say that it was sets them apart from everywhere else.  Big, nice size pizzas and truly premium ingredients.  I personally prefer the BBQ chicken pizza, but they're all good, really.  I've had pizza in New York, Ne w Jersey, California, Arizona, Oregon, Washington, and a bunch of other places and Conforti's is easily in my top 3 favorite pizza places.  Btw, the picture I'm attaching here is after it was sitting out for two hours, and the spots on the paper is rain from bringing the pizza in from my car, not grease...just FYI)"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd say pizza was bad. Until today. I ordered a large white pizza, small plain, and bread sticks. Absolutely awful. All of it. No flavor whatsoever on the white pizza. None. Not at all. Not a spice to be found. How?? I couldn't eat more than a bite. The plain was \"eh\" at best. Both covered in an obscene amount of grease. The bread sticks literally disgusting and the \"sauce\" smelled rancid. I swear to god it was from a jar of plain tomato sauce...with a glob of cheese floating in it. WTH??!! The only reason I give them 2 stars is for the friendliness of the workers.  How they have 4 1/2 stars is unbelievable. I want my $ back."}
{"text":"The pizzas are huge the toppings are fresh and plentiful. All the dishes are great there. I love the stuffed mushroom, and I hear now they are doing bbq now on the weekends witch I need to try. Only thing I will say is the pizza is very greasy so get it to go or make sure you live close........ or know where a bathroom is if your over 5 miles because you might not make it."}
{"text":"I know it's not Vincent's, but daaaang is it good.  Loaded with cheese and a perfect crust, the pie is always fresh and hot. DO NOT GET THIS PIZZA FOR TAKE OUT!!!!! It is only good  fresh, so you must get a table and eat it there!!! I would not like this pizzeria if we only ordered take out.  But, it is a great place to sit down and split a nice pie.  The dark and quiet restaurant also gives a nice aesthetic."}
