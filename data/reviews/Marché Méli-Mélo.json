{"text":"Summary: incredible food and the slow service could be improved. 
I have been to Marché Meli-Melo on a regular basis for the past few years. I always get griot, acras and cola champagne. The pork is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The sauce is savoury and complements the rest of the plate perfectly. Good job! 
As for the service, a smile would be a minimum."}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente, rien à redire dessus, c'est exactement l'endroit où vous devriez aller si vous voulez manger de la bonne  (et authentique) cuisine haïtienne. MAIS (en majuscules oui), si vous êtes patient, je veux dire très très patient et que vous en avez vraiment envie, je vous souhaite bon courage car le service est lent et c'est pourquoi j'ai abaissé ma note."}
{"text":"Awesome Haitian food. Super authentic, the smell will drive you wild. I have no idea how they get such a great flavor so far from Haiti. The boulet, grio, and kabrit are all well worth the wait - 30 min for a Thursday night. They serve it with excellent pikliz, if you need more you can buy a jar or two there. This was definitely the high point of our trip to Montreal. Its one block walk from the nearest Metro station so you have no excuse for not going there."}
{"text":"J'ai habité 5 ans à côté sans jamais oser entrer dans ce commerce. Vous devez essayer leur griot (porc mariné), riz collé (riz avec des fèves), plantain avec un extra acra si vous aimez la friture. 
Si vous avez peur d'avoir l'air d'un touriste: vous entrez, aller à la caisse, commander votre plat, payer. Vous recevez un papier que vous allez donner en arrière où se trouve le casse-croute. Vous aurez un gros lunch savoureux et bien gras."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Love this place when I come to Canada.  not a fancy spot but hole in the walls always have the best food."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet!

I don't really buy anything else there than a few spices , and plates of food.

This place always lives up to my Haitian food cravings. Being Haitian, the food at Méli-Mélo is always good, and always leaves my  tummy full :)

The plates of rice and beans and choice of meats are about 10$ bucks. I always have some left over. Its a lot of food.

I recommend this spot. Order your food at the counter, take it home, and enjoy your Caribbean goodness!"}
{"text":"This was our first Haitian food experience, and it was excellent!  We found our way to the back of the store where they prepare your orders, but the guy working the register was helpful enough to notice us and let us know that we need to order back at the register. He even let us know about their generous portions, and recommended that we order just one meal for the 2 of us.  This was great advice - it was a ton of food!  We ordered the griot (pork), which came with a couple plantains and an absurd amount of rice and beans.  The rice was perfectly seasoned, and the meat was very tender.  

Based on other reviews here, we were hoping for some good food, but the friendly and helpful service really put it over the top!"}
{"text":"Méli-Mélo has a little bit of everything for those who are interested in Haitian and Carribean food and culture. There is a grocery store, with giant sacks of beans and rice, cans of interesting fruits and spices, and fresh fruits and vegetables including sugarcane and whatever kind of mangoes are currently in season in Haiti. There is a hot food counter, with wonderful Haitian meals to go, and pâtés Haïtiens at the cash register. There is a case full of Creole-language books and some Creole magazines and newspapers. There is even a service for sending food or flowers to your friends in Haiti.

A typical Haitian meal consists of meat with rice (usually riz collé - rice with beans, or riz djon djon - flavoured with black mushrooms), plantain (fried), and maybe some salad or pickleez (spicy pickled cabbage). 

Griot is cubes of fried pork. Cabri is stewed goat meat. Lambi is conch meat (seafood) and is a special-occasion dish. Chicken (either grilled or in stew) is also typical but I don't know if it has a special name ... c'est juste du poulet.

To vary your starch (or add to it), try maïs moulu (similar to polenta) with bean sauce (sos), or véritable (breadfruit).

Acra is a kind of cod fritter (savoury) served as an appetizer. 

Pâtés Haïtiens are different from the more-familiar Jamaican patties (though Méli-Mélo also sells those). You have a choice of beef (rectangular), morue/codfish (triangular) and sometimes chicken (semicircular) filling surrounded by flaky puff pastry. Eat over a plate so that you don't miss the crumbs that are sure to fall off. You can take your pâtés home and reheat them, or take them along to a soccer (football) game if you want to be a real Haitian.

Bon appetit !"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite place in the city. The griot is transcendent - it is so good that I literally dream about it for weeks in advance. It's tender, moist, crackling, and basically melts in the mouth. The rice and beans are also fantastic - delicately spiced. Plantains are awesome - the cabri is also good, but the griot is what you need to try. Very few other places have griot like this. And the hot sauce and pikliz! Seriously, do not miss if you're in Montreal for a little while."}
{"text":"Bon spot pour des produits antillais. Service un peu lent pour commander,durant les heures de pointe."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Poulet en sauce et légumes broyé avec le riz collé et quelques bananes plantains...et je me prend toujours des noix de muscade ils ne sont pas cher. Des gens critique le temps d'attente, ce n'est pas un fast food guys? Allez chez Mc do si vous êtes pressé de manger vous n'allez pas attendre. La bonne nourriture prend du temps à préparer parfois."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets!

I knew I was in for a treat when there was a Romados-esque lineup to order. Got myself the griot to go, and ate it on a bench outside. This was somewhere in my top 5 meals ever in this city, and dear God was there a lot of it. You get a very generous helping of pork--I think marinated in that bitter orange stuff--and fried plantains and rice and beans. There's a bigger cup of some sort of vinegary sauce, pea sauce I think, not very hot, and a little cup of pikliz, which is sort of like coleslaw at 100,000 Scoville units. I ate the pikliz in a bite or two and then drizzled the juice over the whole thing--delicious!

Unfortunately the zip ties on my bike basket disintegrated a few days ago, or I would have come home with like 69 jars of that pikliz in tow. It's that good."}
{"text":"Good Authentic Food 
Always Fresh
Great People
For those who are still ignorant about haitian food please visit this place immediately, you'll thank me later"}
{"text":"First time eating Haitian cuisine, Food was excellent! I tried the griot (pork), will definitely try again."}
{"text":"I see you Méli Mélo! Always good to see my people making moves. A combined neighborhood market and restaurant? This is a concept that has been perfected and I often see from my other people, the Italians (just go with it!).

Melo Melo sits on the corner of Jarry and Foucher. This place is non stop, patrons coming in and out throughout the day for various needs. From groceries, to fresh bread, fresh patties(both Haitian and Jamaican), and of course the food, they have it all. There's even a selection of beauty supplies. I'm not sure how but they have managed to fit at least an 8-10 patron seating area in the small pickup corner. That my friend is what I consider maximum space utilization! 

Food is ordered and paid for at the market counter, and the ticket then brought to the back of the store where it is handed to one of the many working chefs/preparers. What do you get in return for said ticket? How about a massive plate of Haitian classics like griot, fritay, taso, diri kolè, and legume to name a few. 

How's the food? I'm biased so it's all freaking delusion. If I can put my bias aside for one second I will admit the patè(Haitian patty) is insanely dry, but we won't focus on that....

Easily the best Haitian food in Montreal and among the best I've had anywhere to be honest. Even my mom gave the stamp of approval; that's a good place to drop the mic....."}
{"text":"The hot food counter is closed right now due to fire damage, but according to staff, they will re-open around the end of this month (November 2016). The rest of the grocery/dep is still open and functioning normally.

Not wanting to leave empty-handed, I grabbed a refrigerated container of \"assaisonnement creole.\"  I asked how to use it and the woman explained (in french) a couple of easy preparations. Made some fish with it the next day and YUM.  will definitely return once they get back up & running."}
{"text":"J'ai voulu commencer l'année du bon pied et c'est avec volonté et conviction que j'ai pris la résolution de diminuer ma consommation de viande ... le seul problème c'est que j'ai été initié à la cuisine Haïtienne au même moment. 

Le marché Méli-Mélo est situé près du métro Jarry et l'apparence très modeste de ce commerce ne laisse pas deviner qu'il se cache un véritable bijou à l'intérieur. 

La cuisine haïtienne est riche en saveurs et mérite que l'on s'y attarde. L'un de ses plats les plus célèbres est le griot, ce plat haïtien est préparé avec des morceaux de porc marinés dans des épices qui sont par la suite frits ou cuits au four. La viande est accompagnée de riz collé (riz aux fêves rouges), et de bananes plantain frites. Les morceaux de viande sont savoureux, croustillants à l'extérieur et moelleux à l'intérieur. J'ai également essayé le poulet frit ... l'un des meilleurs que j'ai eu l'occasion de manger dans ma vie.

Je vous conseil de prendre les plats en \"Take-out\" car la salle à manger est très petite et peu accueillir de 6 à 8 personnes."}
{"text":"When I lived in VT I would travel to Montreal to get Haitian food all the time. The line is always long but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Quand tu rentres quelque part et qu'il y a une line up de malade, en général tu sais que ça va être bon!
Prendre mon mal en patience pour manger quelque chose d'aussi bon, aucun problème! Les portions sont plus que généreuses pour le prix! Et le personnel est vraiment chill! 
J'adore!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'll definitively come back for their chicken! However, I wasn't a big fan of the griot nor the plantain. It was REALLY dry. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like this, but in overall, whatever I ordered was really good.

As for the service; it's not a restaurant so don't have high expectation on the service. They probably will help you out if it's your first time eating haitian food, but that's pretty much it. You actually need to go to the cashier to order. After paying, you just go give your order to the counter/kitchen people. Simple!"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good but the last 2 times I went I was disappointed,not sure if they changed the kitcheb staff but the rice was burnt, griot and bananes were reallllly dry and the sauce had a weird taste. 
Im hoping this was just bad luck and that the quality will return. 

PS try the ginger juice its really yummy and refreshing"}
{"text":"Listen I LOVE Marché Méli-Mélo. I've been here so many times since a friend of mine introduced me to authentic Haitian food, and as long as I'm living in Montreal I will continue to frequently visit! The establishment is a food market with a kitchen in the back that serves hot food. When you walk in head straight to the cash register place your order, and take your ticket to the back to pick up your food. 

My favorite dish at Méli-Mélo is the lambi, which is conch. Lambi is so yummy!!!! It's cooked in the form of a stew and it's delicious when you pour it over the rice and peas. That brings me to what's served in the dinner; each meal is served with rice and peas, pikelez (sorry if I misspelled that), cold macaroni (not the greatest tbh), and plantains. The serving size is soooo huge I have actually never finished my food at the restaurant. My only complaint is that they used to give out 3 plantains with their dinner but now it's only 2? On a positive note, their drinks are so delicious and I would definitely recommend grabbing one to pair with your food. I love this restaurant and it honestly hits the spot when you're looking for comfort food that tastes like a nice home cooked meal."}
{"text":"One if not the best spot for creole/Haitian food in Montreal! My best friend whom i used to date, an Haitian man, made me discover this place some 20 years ago. There was a line-up then. There is still a line-up now for the food!!! EVERYTHING is delicious! The portions are huge. The prices are more then reasonable. I've had it all. My favourite would be the griot or the lambi (conch). I would always order extra bananes pesées and sauce because just in case i get hungry during the night! :) Once, i even drove during a major winter storm just to get my fix. I was probably the only crazy asian lady driving around lol! I've tried other similar places for this cuisine, but nothing comes close to how good this place is!"}
