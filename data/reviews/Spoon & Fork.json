{"text":"Horrendous staff. The fried chicken looks like it died twice. First when they were killed, and a second time when this restaurant cooked it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. We opted for the AYCE but they have a regular menu as well. The sashimi was very fresh. If you like the texture of the squid (Ika), I'd recommend getting that. They had nice table touch and the service was not too bad. My only complain was the order of the beef ribs and mixed vegetables had too much salt in them. Also their AYCE menu is not as extensive as some of the other AYCE places but the quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"My wife made reservations on Fathers Day for a table for four. We showed up exactly at the time of our reservation (7pm) and checked in with the hostess.   Even though there was a crowd around the door, we were told that our table would be ready soon. After waiting for a few minutes and observing others check in, we learned that this restaurant doesn't actually reserve tables.  Everyone who is a walk in joins one line, and everyone who makes a reservation and checks in, joins a somewhat shorter line. Tables are given out in the order that people arrive - to be clear, no tables are actually reserved. If you made a reservation for 7pm and a walk in came at 6:55pm, they would get a free table ahead of you and the party with the reservation is the first in line.  This is an absolutely bizarre system - no other restaurant does this. The hostess(es) were unapologetic despite multiple waiting parties with reservations complaining.   In total, our party ended up waiting 45 minutes for our \"reservation\". A table was actually given to another party in the same situation as us, who checked in after us because, in the words of the hostess, the other party was \"batshit crazy\".  1) The reservation system here is a joke and completely useless.   2) The check in staff are not helpful and rude.  3) Our party, with a young baby and a pregnant mother, ended up waiting longer, paying for the restaurants inability to deal with another \"crazy customer\".  Once seated, the food was decent and the table service was great, with different staff but our evening was largely spoiled already.   Want a reserved table for your party on time and helpful staff? Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been to spoon and fork many times and I absolutely love this Japanese fusion Resturant .. I've been to queensway location and Also the one in Vaughan . I find the queensway location has better service and  food was amazing"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and great service. An awesome combination of both Japanese and thai food."}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat Japanese/Thai restaurant. It has some of the best sashimi/maki and Thai food I've ever had. The sahimi/maki offered at this restaurant are great! The salmon and white tuna are freshly and cleanly prepared, full of flavor and presented beautifully! The Thai dishes are also good and very flavorful; not greasy or oily!  For the atmosphere and décor, they are wonderfully decorated and look very sophisticated and stylish. Service is friendly and fast-paced. Lunch is $15 and dinner is $25 which is very reasonable. AYCE with great taste and prices! WOW. There's always something for everyone here. I most definitely like this place and would recommend."}
{"text":"Vegetarians Beware! One of the worst \"vegetarian friendly\" eating experiences I have ever had.  We decided to try this place after living nearby for some time. I was greatly disappointed with their AYCE menu. The majority of items marked vegetarian contain fish sauce our oyster sauce, this included most hot dishes, apps, rice, and even salads. We had to remind our server with every single item \"no fish, vegetarain\" because they couldn't remember.   With our appetizers I was served something fried that I thought was a veggie safe item that someone else at our table ordered (since we had ordered veggie only.) I was shocked to bite into a piece of FISH inside! It was clearly eel or fish with skin on it and it was revolting.   When I complained I was told \"Don't worry it was just mostly fried wheat\" and that it was \"Only imitation fish\" It was definitely skin and flesh, I was insulted to be told it was imitation. I didn't even receive a discount for this mixup! I have never had an error like this where they didn't at least offer some form of compensation (% off, free food or drink, etc.)   And if that wasn't enough the sushi and vegetarian maki we ordered had random fish eggs on them! I have no problem asking for no fish sauce and reminding that we are vegetarian every single time if it means our food is actually served to us vegetarian.   The quality of the food was mediocre at best, the yam maki was cold and obviously sitting in the back waiting for an order rather than fresh cooked. One of our stir fry dishes smelled of feet. It was just typical average suburban fare and not worth the price.  Overall a truly revolting experience for $30 per person."}
{"text":"The concept here is that you order from a tasting menu, all you can eat, but limited seating time of 2 hours.  Also, you do have to pay extra for any uneaten items at the end of the meal.  This is not really an issue, though as you can continually order items as you go along and don't need to order everything up front.  I have enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried here (which after several visits amounts to a large portion of the menu).  I especially recommend the Curry pumpkin soup, veggie spring rolls and the pineapple fried rice (heavenly...could eat several bowls of just that!).    The atmosphere of the restaurant is great,I like the decor and the ambiance.  The service however is sort of haphazard.  You might have to wait a while to order more items, as the server might deliver some items and then seem to disappear for long periods.    Bit on the pricey side, but in my opinion, worth the cost for the quality of the food and the variety and amount you can select."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Great options and pretty fast service. The sushi was fresh and everything else that came was hot and very flavorful. Great place to bring family or friends. The atmosphere is very busy but happy. Would definitely come back, didn't get to try everything on the menu the first time!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location.  It seems like the menu is slightly different from the one at Don Mills.  They are missing my riblets!!!  Service here was pretty good, no complaints.  Food quality was a bit disappointing at this location.  Both the sushi and sashim did not taste very fresh at all.  The wasibi looked like it had a crust on it (they left it out to long).  The other cooked food was at best average.    On the plus side, beef tataki and the crab fried rice was pretty good.    For 2, $63 tax included.   Will i come back... unlikely.  They should really include dessert on the AYCE menu.  They are charging $30+/person, i think adding dessert is a must at this price."}
{"text":"The decor is great and the place is pretty busy. Choice of All You Can Eat or À la carte. Food was delicious but the service wasn't on par. How many times does one person have to ask for water?!"}
{"text":"To start, this review is more of 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4.  Pregnant cravings had me yearning for Thai food on my last night visiting family in the Toronto area. My niece, who is vegan, had eaten here before and was able to enjoy a vegan friendly meal - and for the rest of us who eat meat, it also offered us plenty of options. We arrived on a Saturday night around 7:30pm with no reservation, but they did happen to have a table for a no-show. The décor made it seem like the restaurant was pretty fancy, but we along with most other diners were also dressed casually.  The menu is a hybrid between Japanese and Thai cuisine, which is something I've rarely seen before, so it was kind of cool. That said, my mind and stomach were wanting Thai food, so that's the section of the menu I looked at. There were 4 of us, and for an appetizer we shared the vegetable tempura (2 plates) - which was fresh, crispy, and delicious. For dinner, I opted for the Thai Peanut Curry Beef, my mom had the Panang Chicken Curry, my dad had the sashimi/roll combo plate, and my niece had Teriyaki tofu.   The prices were above average (in my opinion/experience), but the portions were plentiful for each of us. Unlike other Thai restaurants, there was no option for the \"level\" of spice for the curries - and I tend to prefer the milder curries. The Thai Peanut Curry Beef was around a level 3, which is hotter than I prefer, but the curry was delicious. It was thick, creamy, and full of flavor; I opted to enjoy it with the coconut rice (which was quite frankly devoid of flavor when eaten with the curry). The beef was especially tender. The portion was so big I had to take home half my meal!  Overall, the food and service was both good. It was not the best Thai food I've ever had, but it definitely sated my Thai food cravings."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but a bit on the pricey side. I do like the style of the restaurant. One thing I didn't like was the staff. The hostess was friendly enough, but both the person who took out reservation and the server we had were kind of rude, disinterested in service and acted like basic asks were a bother. There was definitely a vibe of them not really wanting to help or do a good job.  A bit of a bummer"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the staff SUCKS...every time that ive gone i have felt uncomfortable when i ordered. The waiter will make you feel like you ordered to much and wont be able to eat it (i almost always have eaten it all) they also wont bring out like half the items you asked for. Found a better all you can eat place now thankfully"}
{"text":"Right when you walk and you can tell that this place is clean and have a great environment. The food selection is great. Have my birthday year and was a great idea because everybody was able to pay the same price."}
{"text":"Ordered Salmon pizza and to my amazement instead of rice with the hardened outside, they used rice crackers. They were clearly trying to hide it by using a ton of the spicy sauce to cover it. Seriously, gotta cheap out on the rice with rice cakes?   And who charges $3 per person for tea at ayce? This place does!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my wife and daughter. Ambience great, service very professional and a pleasure to deal with. Meal (had the table service buffet) was very well presented and extremely tasty. Highly recommended. Will definitely return. Well done."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy! Enjoyed the quality of sushi and sashimi (very fresh). Food came very fast and customer service was great. Vegetables were fresh too. Bok choy was cooked extremely well, not just boiled like some places.  Would eat here again, perhaps with a bigger appetite! Only thing that was a let down was the hot and sour soup. Mine was sweet. It was weird."}
{"text":"Would recommend coming for lunch if you're really craving sushi. The food was great & everything tasted fresh. By far the best sushi on the Queensway however, there is limited selection. Small portions make it easy to try a little of everything and at the end of the day you won't be leaving hungry. My favourite appetizer was the escargot; tender garlicy and buttery with a smooth texture. The interior is Modern and classy, almost feel like fine dining."}
{"text":"Spoon and fork is one of our favorite places to go for lunch or dinner.  We are there at least one a month and all our friends  love it too.  Satay beef  Satay chicken Chicken in peanut sauce  Coconut shrimp Beef tataki  And spicy California roll are my favorite.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"On the recommendation from sister who lives locally I visited here for a dinner.  I had arrived earlier hearing that it does get bus and that was wise advice.   Arrived around 5:30 but by 6:30 there was a sizeable lineup.   Always a good sign.  Service was attentive.  Food was good with some warm sake, and then sushi and other dishes.  A number of rolls and some rice.  I enjoyed and would return.   I have thanked my sister for the recommendation and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place was great..my hubby took me here for Valentines day however ..service was very slow and staff can be abit more social. Worth the visit great price for a large food selection."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff, great vibe. What more can you ask for. I normally go for the lunch special that's a bit more budget friendly... And I'm always pleased!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends who wants to try different dishes.  I love sushi and hubby won't go near fish, so this is the perfect alternative to his teriyaki chicken.  The potions are perfect taster size.  Quality is much superior to hot table type of buffet son town.  Basil beef was really good for him, while I enjoyed my fresh sashimi.  Unagi maki was also superb.  Service needs improvement, specially when it was busy.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Found hair in my sushi. They apologized but offered no discount or extras. And rudeness was all over the faces of many of their staff.  What type of customer service is that?"}
{"text":"The all you can eat is great for the price. I think they have a few good dishes along with decent sushi. My only complaint about this place is just slow service."}
{"text":"Food quality and service has really gone down over the years. Food was cold and sushi rice was really bad. When complained about the food to the server he just laughed and walked away."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. We ordered off the a la carte menu. I Ordered the chicken katsu.  Only to be presented with store bought and processed chicken fingers.   Not impressed with their menu or quality of food.  Although the sushi menu/all you can eat menu may have been better.  Overall. Over priced and not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and I plan on coming back.  Spoon and Fork have a nice take on the 'all you can eat' without having an actual buffet line to stand in. The food quality is pretty good albeit the portion size is pretty tiny. That said, if you do the unlimited just double down on your orders and you'll be set.  The sushi is reasonably fresh though the octopus is a little chewier than I like. Overall, good value for your money and it is a comparable price range to the typical chain restaurants but has better food and a nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't go to this restaurant if you expect good service.  Minimum courtesy is to pick up the phone when customers are trying to see if space is available. When we showed up to see if there was a table available the host was rude. As if it was our fault for showing up and ruining his evening. The phone was still ringing in the background ...  Awful!"}
{"text":"Spicy salmon rolls were uneatable as they had more tempura bits than salmon so I strongly suggest to stay away from those. Salmon teriyaki was another disappointing item being over burnt and dry. Green dragon roll on the other hand was the best I had anywhere else. Thai items such as pad Thai and sweet and sour fish were very decent for AYCE type of place.   3 menu disappointments: no miso soup for lunch, $3 charge for green tea and dessert is not included in your higher than average price tag.   Decor is very nice and servers were very friendly and attentive. Large tables allowing for a lot of food being brought out without overcrowding.   Verdict if you are looking for AYCE for special occasion when decor matters or you need to accommodate larger crowd it is a decent choice. For your regular sushi fix there are a lot of other places with better value for the money."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, every time I am very please with big the service and food. Some of the best sushi I have had, always fresh and sashimi always served on ice for freshness, unlike many other places. Definitely will be returning :)"}
{"text":"First impressions - I don't see what the fuss is about.   Service was the worst I have ever experienced.  We were completely forgotten.  The bathrooms are disgustingly dirty.   The staff spends more time polishing one glass at a time than looking after their customers. So disappointed. Was looking forward to a nice evening out with friends. Instead left hungry and anointed"}
{"text":"Certainly not the best AYCE sushi I've been to.  The salmon was cut very thin and tasted very fishy.  Not sure how fresh it was (both if us felt icky after).  The pad Thai was ok.  Rolls were ok.  Everything was just ok.  Server was pleasant.  No refills on fountain pop?   You have to be joking.   Will not go back."}
{"text":"The service was fast enough if you ordered more than one item at a time. The good thing is the serving sizes are a lot smaller than a typical order from a restaurant, this way you can try more items on the menu. It's good to ask what it is that you are ordering to prevent any surprises when the food arrives. The down side to having a large group is that some orders might not make it to your table due to numerous orders being taken.( that's a given)   Over all I give this restaurant a 3 because the food tends to taste similar the more you have."}
{"text":"I love this place. I didn't love the Thai side of the menu but I loved almost all my food. Great sashimi and coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"Price for two people during dinner is extremely high, however, the food quality and service is exceptional."}
{"text":"I went to the Spoon and Fork twice, the second time being a few days ago. It was pretty good, could have been better. However, I got food poisoning after I went to this restaurant the second time and here I am, a few days after my second visit and I still have food poisoning. (It's not as bad as it could be, though). It has really nice decor, but it was a bit too dark. It was really pricey  for food that was decent. I may not be back for a while to this restaurant."}
{"text":"What can you see about spoon and fork except that it's awesome. Anyplace it's all you can eat is a good place to me. Though I'll be honest after while everything starts to taste a little bit the same. But that's usually around the time you've earned your money's worth by eating as much sushi, crispy beef, and duck salad as possible. Does the deathly a great place to check out if your hungry. It does get really busy so make a reservation"}
{"text":"Service was really bad... the waiter forgot what we ordered (I guess he would do a better job if he had a notebook and a pen), brought wrong plates to our table, took too long to come... in other words,who cares if the food is good if they don't bother serving it to you?"}
{"text":"great selection of food.  very fresh and tastes great.  the only problem that I can see is the service.  lots of dishes were brought that we did not order.  other then that the food is great and my gd and I love it."}
{"text":"Great selection and surprisingly good quality buffet food. If you're on a date, Just make sure you can hold your own and leave as the big spoon; )"}
{"text":"The variety of food is good here. However sashimi order only comes in very limited quantity AND it only comes once every half hour. This delay tactic is really putting us off."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been upset after having sushi before going to Spoon & Fork.  First off, the service was terrible. At one point, we've waited for over 30 minutes for one(!) plate of sushi and had to ask twice if it was ready or not, while tables around us were getting their plates. The waiter rarely came by to fill our drinks and take plates. We were there for nearly 2 hours, mostly spent waiting and wondering.   Another gripe is the servings. On my first order, I ordered four different kinds of sushi (alongside other stuff) and received two of each, but when I made a second order, I ordered three different kinds and got five of each. Considering they charge left-over plates at a la carte prices and I was nearly full, I had to force myself to finish more sushi than I expected.   The food was average at best, with the appetizers being the best part of the meal. The sushi and sushi rolls were poorly assembled and didn't take that great.   The final nail in the coffin is that it was $27.99 + tip. There are many cheaper restaurants that provide both better food and service."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was that it was a hidden gem, and looked like a nice place that you would find on Bay street. The service was great, seated us right away and always someone checking to ensure we were ok.   Where I was very disappointed was the food. We did all you can eat, the quality of the sushi was bad. Small servings, poor cuts, slimy salmon. I was so disappointed. Even the chicken dishes tasted off.   I hope it was just an off night, but I doubt I will ever go back"}
{"text":"We've have always had good experiences at Spoon and Fork. We tend to use the take-out option more than eat in and we always find that our order is ready promptly and the food is hot and fresh.   Some of our favorites are the crunchy fried wontons, the shrimp rolls, the wonton soup and the pineapple fried rice.   The price point is a bit high, but you do get relatively large portions. We tend to take-out from this location about once a month."}
{"text":"After you have been once and the \"experience\" wears off you realize its really not that good and bang for buck wise, its even worse."}
{"text":"The AYCE price doesn't include any dessert, not even ice cream! $27 per person for AYCE and you still need to pay $4 extra for ice cream! First time at an AYCE that ice cream is charged extra.   The worst part is the service. It's not just lack of smile and friendliness, it's so hard to get your server's attention. Either you get the walk-by with no eye contact, pretending they don't see you, or a server that tells you \"Sorry, I'm not your waiter.\"   I don't expect much from an AYCE, but it's the first time I feel so over neglected the entire night. Not even once that someone came to refill our glasses with water even when they are more than half empty.   Also every time we place an order, one of the items always gets missed and never arrives at our table."}
{"text":"Terrible! Food quality is absolutely disgusting, not to mention cold dumplings, old food, mushy sushi and over fried shrimp. Service is one of the worst we've ever received. Never cleared the tables, took away soy and menu, barely refilled water. They were all unfriendly and had no sense of customer relation. Was really really bad.  I will NEVER give them my business again. It was not worth the $70 for 2 people. I could have ordered Chinese take out for cheaper and better meal."}
{"text":"I typically go to Spoon and Fork, but this is the first time at this location. Although the food tastes the same, I found the service to be sub-standard. The waiter brings the dishes and puts it at the end of the table. Even the drinks were placed at the edge of the table and there were 4 of us. It took a long time to gather the empty plates and took even longer for the waiter to take orders again. I will stay clear from this location and go to the typical one that I frequent."}
{"text":"They use sticks as spoons for the dessert.  They deliver food so fucking late that by the time it's there you will want the bill and leave. Follow me on Twitter"}
{"text":"This place is pricey for a weekend lunch buffet, $17.99, but that's because it's the only restaurant that offers sashimi during lunch, which is totally worth it. If you don't like eating buffets for dinner but are craving for sashimi, this is the place to go. The sashimi selection was quite small compared to dinner though, only 7 varieties (including egg).  The restaurant was very big and packed. The waiter was very nice, since I didn't know how big each plate was and only ordered 1 for my large party of 11, he brought out enough food accordingly.  As for the food, you could tell it was of very good quality. However: DO NOT WASTE YOUR STOMACH ON THE APPETIZERS. They weren't good, in fact the deep fried wontons had no filling, it was just the skin. Each serving is quite small though and we ended up reordering because not everyone had a taste.  There menu was kinda small compared to other restaurants, but the sashimi made it worth it.  The only sad thing was that dessert costs extra so I truly didn't feel satisfied by my meal. I do recommend the garlic beef and beef teriyaki. If I ever craved sashimi, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"When they first opened there lunch and dinner prices were well worth the quality and freshness of the fish you got. But after 2 years, the quality went down quite a bit and there dinner prices are way too expensive, especially on weekends. To get your food it takes quite a bit which they should fix if they dont want to lose to mandarin where you get it yourself and have more of a selection of food."}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch special!! So good. Love being able to try so many dishes of Thai and sushi. Everything is pretty old. You leave feeling way to full but it's worth it. That's how all you can eat should be.   The portion sizes for the Thai dishes are good too because you won't fill up on them and you'll have room for all the other flavours.   Never been here for any time other than lunch but the all you can eat is worth it."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at this location for almost three years. Each time, we've opted for the AYCE lunch menu, which is priced at $17.99 on a weekday vs $26.99 on the weekend. While the quality of their food has always been good, I do feel it has gone down slightly over the past few years. That being said, their weekday lunch is still great value for the selection and quality that you get.  I'm a stickler for salmon sushi and sashimi, both of which are fresh and delicious at this location. My favourites include the tuna sushi, green dragon and dynamite rolls - all of which are great. We once made the mistake of trying the smoked salmon maki rolls, which has put me off the concept of smoked salmon altogether.   From their mains, I really enjoy their Bangkok street style pad thai and tamarind shrimp, although the latter is only available in the dinner menu. One of the stand outs is the teriyaki beef, which has been consistently good. The teriyaki sauce is rich, not too sweet, and the beef is very tender. I like that their serving sizes are small as there tends to be much less food wasted. It also offers flexibility as far as ordering for smaller groups.  Service for us has been good most of the time, as we are usually a group of 3 and plan lunch at not so busy times on a weekday. A few times when we've been a bigger group for dinner, service has been stretched with orders easily missed or repeated. The staff has always been welcoming and friendly though, overall it's a better lunch experience vs dinner.  The ambience is pleasant with plenty of natural light, and they have a nice patio as well. While we've never had space for desserts, they are priced a la carte. As far as drinks, we usually opt for green tea or the very reasonably priced $5 Sapporo drafts.   Goes without saying, you shouldn't plan anything important after a meal like this one and the food coma that is sure to follow. Although I have plans to try other AYCE sushi in the GTA, I will keep coming back here for my reliable favourites!"}
{"text":"AYCE Sunday brunch with our two daughters and a bottle Pinot Grigio. Spectacular as always.  I love having the mini mango salad as a palate cleanser between courses. Appetizers like Goyza, tuna pizza, tempura chicken satay, lemon grass soup are all standard but arrive quickly and hot. Sushi for a second course great maki speciality rolls available, I enjoy the rainbow roll with a spicy tuna hand roll while others enjoyed some veg California rolls.  On to main course speciality items such a curry dishes, mixed grill and the usual favourites try the Thai basil fish or beef.  Their Bangkok street style pad Thai is really good."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out and this was the blandest pad thai we've ever had. The red curry was good but how do you mess up a staple like pad thai? We will not be going back."}
{"text":"My first time of going to this place tonight, they were super busy compare to anywhere else on Wednesday night; the hostesses were so welcoming as other workers in the restaurant. We had to wait10minutes for available table which was not that bad at all.  We sat at the bar ( comfy boot & a little bit sinking) didn't take that long our server showed up. I would say one of the greatest server We've ever had. She was very kind,welcoming, friendly & also knowledgable about drinks& food menu. She informed us about the menu and got the apps first and after few she followed up placing the main course for us.  We had enough time to enjoy our dinner. Quality of food & service was amazed us.  We would definitely recommend this place to everyone. We'll come back for sure and ask for the same server)"}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant was during a weeknight so it wasn't too busy and the food and service was great.  Went back again on a Saturday night and was not impressed.   It took 10 minutes to get two drinks and five minutes after we arrived a group of 10 sat down beside us and they received their drinks before us!  The servers often forgot our food orders and when the right food did show up it took forever.  They seemed under staffed that night given how busy the restaurant was.  Needless to say I won't be going back here for a long time."}
{"text":"Great quality all you can eat Thai and Japanese food.  Presentation is nice, portions are great for sampling, and the service isn't your usual drop and walk away type."}
{"text":"Good service... Good ambiance and the food was good... Went for dinner buffet... Had almost all of the choices in the menu and everything was really good from the Thai to the sushi options everything tasted good... A must try"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and it was delicious!  I've been suggesting to my husband for years that we should check it out and finally he agreed - it was my birthday after all - and he was happy he did!  We went with the All You Can Eat Lunch for $16.99 each and we definitely got our money's worth. We ordered the Wonton Soup, Shrimp Tempura, Fried Wontons, Yam Tempura, Gyoza, Spicy California Roll, Futo Maki, Pepper Beef and Deep Fried Banana. Amazing birthday lunch!  Everything was fantastic, save for the Futo Maki which we didn't finish.  It's hard to pick a favourite but I would absolutely have the Yam Tempura and Spicy California Roll again!  My husband enjoyed the Shrimp Tempura so much he ordered a second helping. I don't blame him, the shrimp was cooked perfectly, it was like butter in your mouth!  The Pepper Beef smelled so good when it was put down that I forgot to take a picture before we eat it!  The flavours were great for almost all the items and the ingredients were fresh. But, the Futo Maki was too large to eat in one bite and the hamaggo (sp?) it's Japanese egg, was strange, kind of like tofu, while the Japanese radish just wasn't for our palette, it also had cucumber, mushroom, and imitation crab in it.  The first server we had was fine, he seemed a little shy, but he did a good job. We ended up changing tables after we got our drinks though because the sun came out and was so hot and bright we couldn't stay where we were. The second server we had was fantastic!  Really knowledgable and outgoing. He always had a smile on his face and it was a pleasure being served by him.   We really liked the way they had set up the menu so that you can go a la carte or all you can eat and try a little of everything for one price and we will be happy to return for dinner.  They have more selection on the dinner menu and the price is $26.99 per person but it is well worth it given the quality of the food.   All that being said, I would have given this place five stars except for one glaring issue:  The restaurant is in need of numerous repairs. From the menus to the walls. The carpets weren't well kept, there were big gashes in the walls that would have benefited greatly from a little black Sharpie, and the dinner menu was in sad, sad shape. There were items blacked out with the aforementioned Sharpie and the finish was coming off the pages. We were disappointed in this because the place is obviously making money and if they invested a little more in maintenance it would be a phenomenal place to visit.  The bathroom was really nice and clean and the atmosphere was inviting. Even with all the high rollers in there for lunch I didn't feel out of place in my jeans."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday lunch with friends.  Nice decor and food was good.  Can't say it was amazing because it lacked some of the spice I was hoping for.  The booth we were sitting in was great for my tall husband but I had to sit on a pillow to comfortably reach the table!  I am the worst all you can eat customer because I can't eat a lot in one sitting.  Either way it was a nice lunch.  I don't have anything negative to report."}
{"text":"I went to Spoon & Fork with a few friends last night.....we were blown away! The ambience and the decor really takes your breath away. This place is perfect for a nice night out with friends or family. The seating was extremely cozy and comfortable, the staff was friendly and the food was mind blowing. I had the Yam Maki, Mango Salad and Friend Banana...and I am definitely going back for some more! We sat there for a couple of hours and could have for another few. Spoon & Fork has really done it well....they have created the perfect ambience for a Saturday night and the perfect recipe that keeps you coming back for more."}
{"text":"I like coming here with a group because everyone can get what they want.  The hard part about AYCE is that I feel as though I need to eat my money's worth!  The pad thai was disgusting and I wouldn't recommend.  The sushi was delish as well as the edamame, and the tempura.  I left feeling good, but not too full."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch during a weekend. They had a all you can eat special (15-17$ per person I think). The food was really good. We enjoyed everything we tried. The service was excellent as well. They gave us just enough time to enjoy our food, without feeling pressure, but were there when we needed water or more food. I enjoyed the decor as well. I would recommend it for lunch. Not sure how it is at supper time."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times in the past many years ago. They were pretty good always.   We went this Saturday with a group of 4 adults and 3 kids. It was very busy dinner time as usual and they are always like this. However this time it was taking forever to get our order. We had to wait for beer 20 min and remind the waiter about it. The kept forgetting bringing things over. The table wasn't clean regularly. We had dirty plates standing there for too long. Overall it felt like a mess. Not sure what happened to this place, but service was horrible. The food was as before. They are pretty consistent with it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and concept is great. The food is acceptable. But the service is horrible. Spoon and Fork is a modern twist of Japanese/Thai/Chinese with an a la carte or \"tasting\" menu where you can select from a variety of dishes. The Decor and Atmosphere is great.   1 hour wait for seating plus 10 more minutes just for the server to come and take our drink order. It was another 10 minutes till we go our drinks ( two waters) Yes two waters.   They ran out of cups so they were unable to refill our water glasses and it seemed all customers were fighting to get the servers attention who seemed to be running around without a clue of who to serve next.   There was no manager in sight as people in the restaurant were getting anxious to get service and get their meals.   Not going back anytime soon. Consider yourself warned!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! Everything is Delish to me!! except for the cashew chicken.  I will go back any chance I get.  Sooo Yummy my taste buds seriously do back flips when I eat there.  Highly recommended. A+"}
{"text":"As for AYCE, it's one of the better options in Etobicoke. Everything is made fresh to order. Dishes are small and of good quality. Many of the soups and curries are a bit over sweetened, but there are plenty of good sushi, maki and sashimi options. The beef skewers are a delicious hot app. The tempura mix is decent. Very nice decor but still casual enough."}
{"text":"Date of visit: Dec 02nd Hostess service: extremely poor  Table service:  fair  As a large group of 14, we made a reservation for 7. We didn't get a table until 7:40. What made it more frustrating was the hostess. I believe her name was Audrey. She was extremely rude, and unprofessional.   The manager was more accommodating. There was no explanation as to why our table was not ready other than, \"we are waiting for a large group to finish\". The large group they pointed to, was just starting dessert so I don't know who they are fooling. As well, the \" large group\" was sitting at a table for 8... It wouldn't have accommodated us regardless.   After speaking to the manager separately, he saw to it that the server was there immediately after we sat down to take drinks and appetisers. The server was fine, and we had one table runner (brings out food) who was exceptional, cracking jokes and always doing a quality check.  Overall experience with food was fine, Hawaii roll and the calamari are great.   However, Will not return."}
{"text":"Worthy of 3.5 stars, but I don't round up when it comes to stars!  We've eaten here twice now.    As far as All-You-Can-Eat sushi places,  this is definitely top of my list, since I find the atmosphere at AYCE restaurants to typically be cold and dull.  But Spoon & Fork has a nice, dimly lit atmosphere and trendy decor.  This makes for a much nicer night out.  I also like the wide array of menu items, with lots of Japanese and Thai items for those who aren't crazy for sushi.  It's a good menu mix for my husband and I, as he loves sushi, and while I don't mind a few rolls, I prefer some chicken and rice dishes.  So at Spoon & Fork, we can have it all!  The dishes are very small in size, but since you can order as many as you like, it's not a problem.  But be sure to order quite a few at the onset, or you'll have gaps where you're waiting for service and for more food to come.   The chicken dishes come with maybe 4-6 small pieces of chicken.   The springrolls are just meh (and I LOVE springrolls, so that's a disappointment to me).  The rolls are all decent, the rice dishes are good (I like the basil fried rice a lot).  At $26.99 for weeknights and $27.99 for weekends (per person), it's a bit on the pricey side, but you can get your money's worth for sure.  Note: drinks and dessert are extra.  The service is a bit hit and miss, and generally slow.  They are ALWAYS busy (make a reservation if you can!), so that is part of it.  The servers are running around the whole time.  But sometimes you want to order something, and by the time you flag down a server and get the food, you've been waiting so long that you are sort of done...    It's a totally decent place, and good for large groups.  Also great for couples/crowds with mixed tastes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time. They have the best all you can eat menu in the GTA. The menu provides a lot of selection and is always fresh. The only thing I can say is that the service can improve. There has been a few times that we ask for food items and they forget to punch it in."}
{"text":"After a 45 minute wait, we finally got it. It was good! Some of the sushi and sashimi we ordered was great, some not so great. My favourite was the spicy California rolls. The waiters were running around looking frazzled and I felt pretty bad for them. They seemed to have a hard time trying to keep up with the craziness."}
{"text":"Food here is very good, but the service is super slow.   Even during non-peak hours, the service seems to be very slow.   I have started only doing takeout, which is awesome. The take out is usually ready in about 15 minutes, and they give you a discount for doing takeout."}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can taste lunch buffet and loved the variety that the menu offers. For the appetizers we got the Edamame, Thai Dumpling, Shrimp Tempura, Escargot, and Fried Calamari with the Miso Soup and Mango Salad.   While they're all good dishes but I find that the Mango Salad was a bit underwhelming as it doesn't look like the picture shown. which in fact, was the same issue with the golden dragon roll we ordered later on. The picture shows that the salmon is wrapped around the whole Maki roll but wasn't the case when ordered. The Sashimi is very fresh and nicely cut but the dish it came with was a bit to large for the serving, which makes it a problem for such a small table I was sitting at.  if your sitting with a group of 4, you should definitely choose the tables with the bench seating as we didn't have enough room on our square table.   Those were the only cons I can see with the place, despite that, most items are very appealing and fresh to taste, offering a great selection from both Japanese and Thai foods at a $16.99 price point. To clear up some confusions, lunch mon - fri is $16.99 while weekend lunch is $17.99.  overall if I'm ever in the craving for a sushi lunch buffet this will probably be my main choice."}
{"text":"I went to this place with bunch of friends on busy Saturday night. We were about 10 people and we had a really good time.  Sushi was unexpectedly really good. Bonito Sashimi was really good as well as other Sashimi and Sushi. Tempura was really crispy and not greasy, delish!  We enjoyed Japanese menu too much to really enjoy Thai food on the menu but a few dishes we managed to try were all really good.  Service was good considering we were a big group and it was on a Saturday night. I would go back there again for sure."}
{"text":"Great Decor but horrible service. Food was late, service was slow. It was more like the waiter was trying to run around and get as many tables as he could instead of actually servicing the customers. We were told at the end that we were being charged for the food that was left over because we had the all you can eat option. I think its a great idea and the decor is beautiful as well but really I would rather go to a small corner sushi place where I know I can expect good food and service at half the price."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE for a friend which is $28.99. Food did not disappoint. We got the  Edamame, hot n sour soup,  lemongrass soup,  Shrimp pad Thai, coconut shrimp,  fried calamari,  spicy California roll,  some beef strips and an assortment of calamari.   My favourite was the lemongrass soup, coconut shrimp and fried calamari that I ordered numerous times. The lemongrass soup was nice and tangy while the coconut shrimp actually tasted like candied shrimp and didn't have just a small sprinkle of coconut flavour like other places. The calamari was delicious and the breeding was nice and crispy. Ambience is very nice and staff is very quick. We went in the evening around 8-9 on a Sunday however it wasn't that busy. Bathrooms were really dirty when I went to wash my hands but it was the end of the night so not sure if that's to be expected. I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this location quite often and I would give it a 4 star rating if it weren't for my most recent experience in May. It's great for small groups (2-4 people), but I'd refrain from visiting in large groups.  TLDR: Don't advertise as AYCE if you're going to purposely stop serving us food.  Pros: - One of the better quality AYCE I've had - Small portions so you actually have stomach room to taste various dishes (ie. they don't load you up on carbs like a lot of the other AYCE places do when you order entrees- Might I suggest their Ching Mai Noodles?) - Nice decor  Cons: - No dessert included in AYCE - Some menu items listed are not available. I've visited a few times and asked for the stuffed crab shell and tebayaki (grilled wing) and they never have it  - Poor service for large groups   We came as a group of 11 for AYCE for my boyfriend's birthday so obviously we were ordering a lot of food. They give you a two hour dining limit, but after the first hour, the waitress stopped coming by and we would have to wave her over for water refills and ordering. To be fair, she seemed very apologetic. After the order was put in, we waited for 40 minutes before any sashimi or tataki would come out again and even then it was not the full order (other \"cheaper\" items like the carby dishes would come out very quickly). They also limit the amount of sashimi and tataki you can order at once so if the food doesn't arrive, you don't have time to order more either. Exactly at the two hour mark, the manager? came and told us we had to leave even though a lot of our food (sashimi/tataki) ordered previously had yet to arrive. Many of our friends left not being fully satisfied.   Note: Apparently this has happened previously as well when my friends came in large groups so they were not surprised it happened again. I would also like to mention again that this never happened when I visited in smaller groups and I would probably still revisit."}
{"text":"This has been our favourite since they opened this location. We sat on the patio for lunch on the weekend and were happy the quality is the same great quality as always (haven't been in a while). Great selection on the all you can taste menu. And yes, perhaps they're more expensive than others but you get what you pay for. Some reviewers claim they're just average - where do they eat that is so good. I'm yet to find those places. Anyways if it bothers you that drinks or ice cream is not included, go somewhere cheaper."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner. Nice decor, lots of food options and ok service. I'd recommend going for all you can eat because it gets pricey when you order from the al a carte menu."}
{"text":"Horrible sushi. I can't believe the spicy salmon meat in the hand roll and the maki is deep fried. Dripping grease out of minced spicy salmon is disgusting. There was nothing on the menu that our table of four had anything good to say about. Never again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Toronto. They have a great all you can eat menu but very high quality food. We go there all the time with family and friends.  Prices are reasonable considering the quality and variety of the menu."}
{"text":"Seriously good sushi for a great price!  The ambiance is also more than what you'd expect at an all you can eat place.  They have a wide variety of side dishes that are great, for example the curry shrimp is phenomenal.  I've gone here several times and the food is always consistent (it's been sushi every time though).  The service is hit or miss and once I came without a reservation and waited about an hour to be seated.  I wish they were open later."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my coworkers to celebrate my boss's birthday. I like their decorations, the food is good too.   But I don't like the fact that they don't include dessert, or fruit in the buffet. I really think they should include dessert and fruit for the buffet.  The price seems to high for me if no dessert or fruit or drink is included."}
{"text":"Went there twice...both times had really good food especially the sushi. The decor is amazing ..comfy sofas (somewhat hard to eat properly on them though) nice lounge area also by the bar. The service was not amazing ..especially the second time it just seemed a little chaotic..our server seemed to get the hint that we were getting annoying so he got his act together after that. Also ordered a pad Thai with extra peanuts and ended up receiving a pad Thai was no trace of peanuts whatsoever but that was about the only issue I had. Great food and a good variety of it to ..would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I felt so guilty eating all-you-eat for lunch. But being the accountant myself, the lunch prices vs the lunch tasting menu and the amount of food, just makes more sense doing the lunch tasting menu. So I went for it... try to only eat the stuff that are special.  The food is decent for all you can eat. I had a variety of food - hiyashi wakame (seaweed salad), Edamame, yam tempura, shrimp tempura, gyoza, agedashi tofu, assorted sashimi, rainbow roll, golden curry, unagi fried rice. I think I did quite good, was really full afterwards, good thing I was wearing a spandex dress.  $17 for all you can taste lunch. On the side note, I got scammed with getting the green tea - $3 so beware of the extra charges and just stick with water. It was a really busy place during lunch time, and many people doing all you can eat."}
{"text":"Nice decor, good service, average food, expensive.  Not a disaster by any means but nothing special either."}
{"text":"This place is a total RIP OFF!! We were there last night and we had the worst experience. The food is good but it's nothing you can't get anywhere else. The service was TERRIBLE. People say this is an upscale restaurant? All they did was dimmed the light. The all you can eat menu options were so limited. There is no desert/ice cream or drinks included in the rip off price of $27. Don't bother you will be disappointed. Save your money. Go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Friday night and the place was packed! You should definitely made resos if you are planning to eat here on a weekend. Had to wait about 45 mins but we didn't mind because we could grab a couple drinks at the bar. The bar was great - Sapporo pints were on sale for $4.99 and they had delicious and generous sized blended drinks (virgin) for $3, which was great for my pregnant friend.   On to the food - AYCE on weekend came to about $30 each. We actually had no idea it was AYCE, so when I found out I was a little worried because anyone who has had AYCE will know that it is best to go with a larger group so you can try a little bit of everything without wasting food. The great thing about this place is that they give you small portions so you don't have to hold back (this is probably the only time you will appreciate a restaurant that serves small portions!). The food was delicious! The lemongrass soup was amazing. Try the escargot if you are feeling adventurous - it is cooked in a tasty garlic butter. All of the sushi and rolls were decent, love the Dragon roll.   Decor - very cool, modern and trendy. Huge, high ceilings, interesting details like light fixtures made of spoons and forks. A nice place to have a girls' night out - in fact, there was a bachelorette group there that night.   I only have two complaints 1) the sashimi was not consistent - the first batch of salmon I ordered was fresh and delicious but the second tasted a little old and mushy. 2) I had to ask 3 servers for some hot sauce and then waited about 20 mins before any was brought to me.   Overall impressed. I'm usually not a huge buffet/AYCE fan, but this is definitely an exception. Will go back for sure.   P.S. Was anyone else curious why it is called \"Spoon & Fork\"? We Asians like our chopsticks!  P.P.S. Hot sauce here is sriracha - I'm ok with it, but I know some people find the taste overpowers their food"}
{"text":"this is the best asian ayce place i've been to in all of the city at the moment you'd have to try it. jennifer k and wayne c mentioned it to me awhile back to try it.   decor, ambiance, food preparation, top notch, go here before it goes downhill. :)  no dessert included.   kind of pricey at $30+ per person inc. tax and tip for dinner."}
{"text":"This place provides a great atmosphere for spending time with family. The food here is fresh and delicious but the service can be lacking. I recommend going here when it's not as packed."}
{"text":"Thai Food is very good. However it is not the best place for Sushi... Pricing is reasonable; the restaurant is clan and modern looking.  I would recommend calling and making a reservation before going to this restaurant as the wait time for walk-in's can be as long as 45mins (according to my experience)   Their service is not the best as the servers are very busy and will try to rush you to order.  However the meals are served quite fast.  I would go to this place again since it is the only place I found in the GTA with some decent / authentic tasting Thai Food."}
{"text":"It's sad to see this place go completely downhill.  I used to come here between 1-2 years ago on several occasions, and I would of given it 5 stars. Last time I went with one other person, it took approximately 20 min after being seated to just get water and another 20 min after to get our order. The food was very plain and dry, and we never got to see our water for either more water or to just get the bill. On top of that, it took them even longer just to correct our bill. Highly dissatisfied, and from the reviews people have given, I'm sure there have been changes with management."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend and another couple, we ordered the ayce (24.95 pp) and ordered a ton of food.  The waitress was very honest and upfront about the portion sizes, letting us know that the entrees were half the size that they would normally be, and that if we wanted more we could just ask that we have 2 orders of a particular dish.  We had a variety of salads, sashimi, maki, entrees, and dessert.   The sashimi and rolls were quiet good, a wide variety of options as well as fresh fish. Can't go wrong here!  The entrees were average at best, I found that my Basil beef lacked flavour and my friend commented that his pad thai was also flavorless.   Salads were TINY but tasty, the mango salad I had was excellent.   Desserts were not part of ayce but we had some anyway, they were standard, store bought cheesecake and ice cream.  The decor is nice, dark wood and mood lighting. The service is attentive and knowledgeable. I will definitely consider this restaurant in the future if I am ever in Oakville!"}
{"text":"this is a restaurant with nice decor, prompt staff, and good food, all at a fair price.  This explains why it's so busy and you definitely need a reservation in the evenings to get in. I hope it doesn't change."}
{"text":"Do you like sand in your surf clam? This restaurant thinks you might! Our waiter was surly or tired. Perhaps he just hates his job. Anyway, took a long time to take our order but the food was good enough aside from the surf clam. Hot and sour soup was good. Green curry was good. All the maki is the same. Bathrooms are clean. Nice decor but starting to look a bit dated. Won't be back unless forced to."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to hang out and the food was pretty decent. Service could;ve used a bit more umph but the girl serving us was new. She was very friendly so even if we waited for our water refills it wasn't something worth complaining because she was great worth everything else.  The ambiance was great...kinda dark and chic.  I took my sister and my mom with me and the furnishings were pretty luxe but the space in between the tables were ridiculously tight. I haven't been to the bar area but the one we were at was just tight."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. If you want a really modern classy place to sit while u eat then come here. If u are more for getting your money's worth ($26.95 on weekday dinner) then don't come here. The food takes FOREVER to come out.  Many other all you can eat sushi/Asian places will offer you better food WITH DESSERT included for a cheaper price. No thanks, spoon & fork... You are overpriced and not worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! We love coming here for Sushi and tasting buffet! the Sushi is very high quality!"}
{"text":"Horrible!! Been to all locations and this one is the worst.  They should just close it down. Food is flash fried from frozen, dried up and looks old.  We told servers and they didn't seem to care.  It's probably more tasty to eat from a horse troughs than at this place.  I'm embarrassed for the Spoon and Fork brand to have this location operating"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Worth the money.  Staff is always friendly and food is delicious.  I always want to go to Spoon and Fork when I am in the mood for AYCE.  For any special occasion this is my first choice!"}
{"text":"The decor of this AYCE restaurant was great, beautiful even. However, the food and the service lacked terribly. We went on a week day for lunch. Besides 2 or 3 other tables being occupied there was no other guests. The server seemed bothered we were there and was not at all friendly. The food was meh! I've been to other AYCE joints and although I don't except superior service or out if this world food, this place just lacked period. The sushi rice was dry and stale. The chicken we ordered was so hard it was barely chewable. Would I return? Probably not!"}
{"text":"Food quality is great! We ordered the all you can eat. Quantities are a bit small and it takes a while to come in. Need to order a lot of dishes in the beginning if you don't want to wait. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service!!!  Loved the varied small dishes which allows you to try so many delicious treats."}
{"text":"My fave spot for all you can eat sushi! Great service, amazing selection, and a beautiful atmosphere with the dining area well decorated. This place has a great vibe and is extremely popular. Make sure to make reservations! Lunch is cheaper than dinner, and the selection is mostly the same."}
{"text":"I came here on Tuesday. This was the third time I've been here and it felt like it wasn't as good as it used to be.   It is an all-you-can-eat restaurant. The atmosphere was quite nice. The service was mediocre - it took forever for our server to walk by our table. It seemed like they only had one server. I would say the best dishes there are the deep fried calamari, curry pumpkin soup, and some of the sushi items (which were really only an OK). They had a lot of variety of dishes though - I didn't like how the \"From the Wok\" items (ex. Peanut Sauce Chicken) came with a side of rice. The should have stated that on the menu that the dishes came with a side of rice. Overall, I was kind of disappointed this time as I remembered it to be amazing last few times that I had been.  Unlike other all-you-can-eat sushi places, dessert is not included - very disappointing.   Probably would not go back to this place for a very long time."}
{"text":"Green curry and peanut sauce chicken is a great 1-2 punch of flavor. Would definitely go back again for dining in or take out."}
{"text":"Great food sushi was great also with the stir fry the service was fast and great. ALL YOU CAN EAT?! and boy I can eat.."}
{"text":"A little pricey, customer service quite good, very good quality food, menu a tad limited.  I've been to this venue twice on work events. They have a mix of Thai & Japanese dishes, and it's an AYCE (all you can eat) type of place.  The price is a bit high, especially when you go as a group of 8 or more as they automatically add the 15% gratuities in that case, totally around $22 per person. The menu is a tad limited in terms of the kinds of sushi they have, but they do have a fair amount of sashimi on their lunch menu.  So all-in-all, I'd like return to this place, although I might be a tad hesitant due to the priciness with the limited menu."}
{"text":"A different twist to east meets west. Chic western decor serving all you can eat sushi and Chinese. Sushi wasn't bad for an AYCE. Some items hit and miss (like the chicken katsu being so tough you needed a hacksaw), but overall enjoyed it. The atmosphere definitely changes it up from your usual jap place."}
{"text":"Eating super fancy schmancy Asian all-you-can-eat certainly comes at a heft price - $32 after tax per person.   The sashimi is the freshest I've had and they offer white tuna, ika, ebi, butterfish, hokkigai...etc. They're served nicely presented on a small plate - if you want more, be sure to order two or three servings otherwise they will give you one piece per person.   The soup options are pretty awesome -  1. Curry pumpkin soup was delicious but not for those who can't take it spicy  2. Mushroom bisque - my favorite! I had two bowls.. That was how much I liked it.  3. Miso soup - nothing to write home about but at least it doesn't taste like MSG 4. I need to try their coconut soup next time, I decided not to fill my stomach up with only soup   There are plenty of salad options - I went with the smokes duck salad as I've never seen that offered before at other places. It would have tasted pretty bland without the dressing.   Service wasn't the fastest, and our waiter appeared unenthusiastic while taking out order. I think they should change the ordering system so that customers can just write down their order instead of waiting around for the waiter to write it down for us.   It sucks that drinks and desserts are not included in the AYCE price. My honey ginger tea was $4.00 - refillable but you can barely taste the ginger after the refill.   If you want to try AYCE sushi and Thai food in a fine dining atmosphere, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The hostess and waitress isn't that welcoming. The food is a bit pricey, but I LOVE the sushi! It's very fresh and one of my favorite places to get sushi when traveling in the area. The beef green curry is bland and the pad Thai is a bit on the sour side. The eel and salmon sashimi is definitely a must!! I would recommend trying Spoon And Forks. But, I wouldn't dine as often because of the price."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day with a colleague. This is not the kind of place you want to come to if you don't have a lot of time for lunch. You need to give yourself at least an hour and a half.   The service we had yesterday was pretty good. I've gone there before and the service has been downright negligent. It all depends on where they seat you, how large your group is, and who your server is. Luckily I was only dining with one companion so we weren't neglected or treated as unwelcome intruders.   The food is pretty good. Some of the dishes they do quite well (yummy green curry and satay). Some of the dishes are decent (mango salad, chicken katsu). Other dishes are not that great (pad thai - which is never a favourite of mine, but my colleague wanted it - was sweet as hell and quite gloppy to boot).  This place lacks consistency so I can definitely understand some of the poorer ratings."}
{"text":"Service was very rude and horrible they could not give me a wait time then manager just walked away. I do NOT recommend. So many other better places"}
{"text":"Nice place for AYCE sushi. Like the environment and decorations. Came here for lunch this time, they had a pretty good selection for lunch.   Espergots, fried calamari, and beef/ chicken satay skewers are good options for appetizer. But avoid there tempura, way too much batter coating! You nearly find the tiny shrimp hidden in the tempura;(  Sashimi: Due to breast feeding I was not able to eat raw fish, but my accompanies say the fish were fresh and average quality.   Rolls and maki: crazy roll is great, bbq eel & avocado & cream cheese inside, my favourite! Green dragon is also good for non-raw fish eaters. The crab roll was not that I had imagined they were raw!? And there were salmon rolled on top, which looked pretty delicious but I wasn't able to eat.  From the wok: salmon teriyaki was good especially with the garlicky gingery sauce on the side! Basil beef was fantastic but a little bit on the spicy side (strong taste). Recommend the sweet and sour fish, surprisingly tasty that I had two orders!  Overall it's a good experience having lunch at spoon and fork. Subtotal for three of us came to 57.6 before tips."}
{"text":"Everything was good except the sushi was disappointing. Would not recommend or return for sushi for everything else was fine. I was expecting more authentic Thai and Japanese dishes, sushi tasted like the ones you would buy from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food sucked and was expensive. The rolls was all rice and half the food never came. So disappointed"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite sushi place. But I am having a really bad experience. I went there on Thursday (12/04/2018) to celebrate my friend's bday. We were 7. The food was really good, and the service, as aways, ok. On Friday night we started feeling bad, nauseous and vomiting, on Saturday, high fever and diarrhea. All of us had the same symptoms. Please, be more careful with the food you are serving."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat (AYCE)!!!  For a regular lunch price these guys offer a lot and you wouldn't be able to work after the lunch.  The server was very friendly and once we told her we have to be out in about an hour, she made sure the food came out quick.   We ordered quite a bit... the best thing about their AYCE is they provide provide sashimi in their lunch menu. Their lunch menu is quite vast and they have a fusion of Japanese/Thai flavours. So we had sashimi, sushi flying all over the table and we also got some fried stuff. My favourite was their Thai green curry, it was very good and cooked to perfection.   Overall, the service, food and atmosphere was excellent."}
{"text":"I'll include a disclaimer; I have just moved to the Toronto area from Niagara Falls, home to Wind - which just might be the golden standard for sushi. In our search to find a replacement 'go-to' AYCE sushi, we happened upon Spoon & Fork. It was definitely our first and last.  The appetizers were great. I loved the yam tempura and coconut shrimp. We started off well and we were impressed... until the sushi rolls came.  There were only four pieces per roll.. which I've never seen before but whatever, it is AYCE. However, it was poorly rolled and the half of it was rice. I didn't quite understand what was going on with our sweet and sour fish. There was some sort of beef/ribs in BBQ sauce thrown on top with some other stuff I couldn't even name.The fish itself was drenched the in brownest sweet and sour sauce I've ever seen. And it wasn't a nice brown either, if you get my drift.  The service itself was fine. Not the best, but not the worst either. The place seems understaffed and we didn't see our waiter often - we were never asked how our meal was and we ate half our meal with empty glasses.  But the showstopper was the bill. I was totally expecting the $28 dollar price tag. What I wasn't expecting was the $3 dollar price tag for my green tea. I have never, EVER been to a sushi restaurant that charged for green tea. And I have never in my life paid $3 dollars for a tea bag and some hot water. Not to mention the 'all you can eat' doesn't include dessert. You pay for that too. And thanks, but no thanks, I'm not giving you $5 for a scoop of ice cream.  I'm glad I tried it - but I won't be back. Management should take a trip down to Niagara Falls and see how it's done."}
{"text":"This is first time experiencing All you can eat menu at this high end place. The food is exceptional delicious, although only comes with small portion, sort of giving your more room to taste other food selection. I personally like teriyaki beef, Bok Choy with garlic, the sashimi is ask quite fresh. I will definitely recommend this place and revisit next time in town."}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi restaurant I've been to! A bit pricey during dinner time but definitely worth it!! Quality of the food is fresh! Service is excellent! Customers leave here happy and satisfied!! Also, the interior design of the restaurant is very nice and fancy. This is the place I go to whenever I'm craving sushi, sashimi, and hand rolls."}
{"text":"If I could I would give 0 stars the only thing we liked was the ice cream on the end. The service was just ok.. Food was like warmed up in a microwave but still cold.... very dry... the food was tasteless would definitely not recommend it 70$ for two people definitely not worth it"}
{"text":"First of all, the first impression with the restaurant was already ruined my visit by the host girl. She did not seem to appreciate our business (7 people). They never have the Thai lemon grass soup every time I go there. Also, you will have to constantly look for your assigned table server to make your orders, other servers pass by you or nearby your table will ignore you even if you wave at them.  I do need to point out that there are wide variety of cuisine on the menu you can choose from and they I believe are made to order because the cooked dishes i got were hot."}
{"text":"Wishful thinking for giving this place a 3rd try, yet they fail once again. To top it off, we had a superstar waiter that made our dining experience an awful one. Not only was he rude!! He was very impatient and loud. The food was mediocre and the service was even worst."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat (AYCE)!!!  For a regular lunch price these guys offer a lot and you wouldn't be able to work after the lunch.  The server was decent and the food came out on a decent pace.   We ordered quite a bit... the best thing about their AYCE is they provide provide sashimi in their lunch menu. Their lunch menu is quite vast and they have a fusion of Japanese/Thai flavours. So we had sashimi, sushi flying all over the table and we also got some fried stuff. My favorite was their fried Cheese cake from their dessert menu (extra cost), it was warm on the outside and cold on the inside.   Overall, the service, food and atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"VERY upset after going there on Friday.  I am on a special diet where i have to eat extremely low carbs and asked for my hand rolls to be made without rice.  They refused to do it after i told them i had dietary issues and couldn't eat the rice.  The waiter watched me scrape the rice out of my roll three times!! We kept making such a big deal about it and they would not budge on giving me the scoop of rice in every roll.  There job is to adhere to my needs since I'm eating the food.  SO unaccommodating and rude!!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation on a Mon for a Wed night. Good thing I did! I was quite surprised that the place was filled up by 7:30p. Walking into S&F, the environment and feel is very modern and upscale. You would think that this would be a place serving something other than Japanese (let alone sushi).   I ordered salmon & white tuna sashimi, spicy salmon roll, rainbow rolls, fresh mango salad, edamame beans, bangkok style pad thai and pineapple fried rice, butter fish tataki (this was for 2 people). Quality and taste-wise, the sashimi certainly was NOT anywhere close to what smaller restaurants serve up in Markham. The mango salad was certainly tasty and just the right portion. My favourites would be the pad thai and fried rice. They were both sweet (in taste) and the pad thai had a good amount of heat. I ended the night off with a deep fried ice cream which me and my friend enjoyed. I believe the batter is made up of corn flakes!  The speed at which my 2nd orders came out were unfortunately slow. The place was certainly packed which could've explained why. It took about 15 minutes for my green tea to arrive at the table."}
{"text":"5 stars if not for the lack of dessert and beverages in the buffet menu which is pretty standard in most AYCEs. It's slightly more expensive than average by around 2-3 bucks but there really is a good reason for it. I'm still a bit miffed with fork and spoon's serving sizes where if you order a pad thai, it is pretty large. I doubt you'll have room for a lot more stuff after scarfing down the bowl. Solution:come in large groups and share.  As for the food, it was friggin outstanding. Way way way WAY better than an average AYCE. The bangkok pad thai I found to be better presented and tastier than some a la carte restaurants. I was full but forgot to order the beef teriyaki so I ordered one (served medium). It was amazing! so I ordered another one, and another one, and another one. It got embarrassing after a while. Prince sushi has similar teriyaki which was the only reason I went to their dinner only buffet. Now there is no reason. Everything I had (and I had a lot) did not disappoint.  Apparently this used to be thai viet but is now thai japanese. The interior looks like a high end bar, not an AYCE. Service was satisfactory at the minimum. I really can't complain.   Not that packed on a saturday lunch which is probably because it is surrounded by a lot of other restaurants. This bodes well for my very probable multiple weekend visits."}
{"text":"AYCE places have tried to up their game for a long time and I personally never had an interest in AYCE. Maybe its perception that the food is mediocre. I went to Spoon and Fork for the AYCE lunch special with a friend in the Oakville location on a Friday lunch time in January.  Overall the quality is not bad and I have to give kudos to the restaurant for dishing out good quality sashimi considering the volume of hungry customers. But it will never replace the a la carte restaurants. And given it is AYCE the expectations have to be lowered. Still, its a quick and rather cheap way to fill up quickly for lunch. The only thing is the server was a tad slow in the beginning where other tables had their food before we even had ours and we ordered first."}
{"text":"Food was good, definitely better than most AYCEs. service satisfactory.   I have 2 issues with this place though.  1) Its AYCE and yet when you order something, its big enough to be one whole meal even when I specifically requested for it to be served in small portions. Server said items would be served in small individual sizes so do not worry. It was individual all right. One full meal for an individual. This pertains to the thai items mostly. 2) Thai and japanese food just dont mix in one meal. You can't savor each cuisine properly.  Recommendation: go in large groups. have a little taste of everything. bottom line, the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Gone are the days of singular themed restaurants and here are those of fusion fine dining. A recent excursion to Vaughan taught me that a Japanese style sushi bar can successfully mate with Thai cuisine to produce the elegant love child known as Spoon and Fork.  Open daily for lunch and dinner Spoon and Fork has found a way to offer the gluttony of All You Can Eat (AYCE) with the class of fine dining; offering an experience that's sophisticated enough for business meals and special occasions to a casual meeting of friends. Most patrons were on the more casual side of dressy-casual, although for a Tuesday evening several people, including myself, had decided to bring their A-game.  Located in the Colossus plaza in Vaughan, ON finding S&F can be a trick, but once found parking is seldom an issue and in my recent experience we found a spot in mere seconds. A nice change from the fight for parking near Toronto fine dining.  Upon arriving, my dining companion and I were amazed at the elegance and sheer contrast from traditional AYCE sushi spots we had frequented across the GTA. From the cushioned leather armchairs, and tables with wine glass setting, cloth napkins and the white table cloth, to the dim lighting with candles on each table made for what I felt to be a very chic and stylish décor, imprinting on myself and other patrons that S&F is class in the 905.   Visiting on a weekday night, meant that we avoided the normal line ups and reservation process and were seated immediately upon entry. Although the restaurant was quieter, a majority of its tables with still filled with an assortment of people. Some being women out for ladies nights, families celebrating birthdays, and couples out on midweek dates. The average age of patrons was approximately 25-34 with most being Caucasian.   After being seated our waitress was as good as any other I had ever had, serving us armed with charm, an extensive knowledge of the menu, efficiency and speed. She handled all of our menu questions with grace and ease and took time to explain what certain Japanese named items were.  Once placing our initial order, our food began to roll out of the kitchen in waves within minutes, and best of all there were no mix-ups. Every item was exactly as we asked - a rarity for a sushi spot. With each wave of food arriving at our table so came another wave of Japanese/Thai fused flavours. Sushi roles with cilantro and other Thai spices integrated in the mix, rested deliciously on a bed of Thai chili infused spicy mayo.   We did note that portion sizes were slightly askew from other high end AYCE sushi restaurants. Sashimi (raw fish slices) and sushi were very small in comparison. Also, this fish, which is meant to be served chilled, was only slightly cooler than room temperature, making me question how long it had been left to sit out.  Aside from this one bump in the road, the food was delicious and each plate was created with effort towards visual presentation despite the high volume of food being churned out of the kitchen. Throughout the remainder of our meal, our tea was kept piping hot and we ordered several more times making quite a dent in their menu.   When it came time for the cheque Spoon and Fork offered all payment options, we paid via debit and the machine was conveniently brought to our table. Pricing was a tad more expensive than a typical AYCE at approximately $27/person (norm is between 18-25/person with green tea included) however the more trendy/sophisticated ambience would explain the above average pricing.  Over all our dinner experience at Spoon and Fork was enjoyable and I shall return again, many times, hungry!"}
{"text":"Great food. But waited 45 minutes for a table. The waitress told us it would be a 20 minute wait so definitely did not appreciate that. Other than that, the food was pretty good. One of a few sushi places that even have the volcano roll (deep fried maki roll). I would recommend making a reservation before going to this location, or else you'd be waiting an excruciating amount of time."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents and was advised to try the tasting menu, which was a great idea.  A fantastic mix of Thai and Japanese food, including sushi, curries, Pad Thai and a great assortment of starters.  I really enjoyed the food, particularly the thick shrimp curry, which was similar to a Masamam. Divine.  For $25, it's a bit more expensive than the other buffet restaurants but I would go back and I really like the policy of paying extra for wasted dishes.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Coming here on a Saturday night without reservations, was probably the worst eating decision we've ever made. Definitely book ahead of time!  Arriving at 8:10, we were told wait would be up to 45 minutes wait. Twice we followed up, it was the classic \"just a couple minutes\"...great. Finally by 9:20 we were seated.  The restaurant was packed, and still with 10-15 people waiting at the door.    For a Saturday night, they were incredibly understaffed. The sushi chefs had plates of sushi and sashimi waiting to be picked up by the wait staff. Staff was not attentive. We had a pile of dirty dishes on our puny two-person table, for most of the night.   Food quality was great for AYCE. Escargot on the menu for apparently - that's different! But yum, none the less. Sushi & sashimi was fresh. Many different types of tataki was available - beef, salmon, white tuna, butter fish tataki. They serve spider rolls here, that's always a plus!   Don't get the scallop Rockefeller. You'll be digging through plenty of mashed potato, mayo & cheese, before you actually fund the overcooked piece of scallop.   No dessert included! Waaaaaah."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on mother's day. This place did not meet our expectations. Besides the fact that it reminded me of a typical AYCE restaurant, the wait staff was extremely slow and never smiled, not even after we tipped them. As for the food, all of the rolls had the same taste - drenched in mayo. It was not very pleasant and I couldn't even decipher what I was eating.  Their sashimi was still a bit frozen and the portion size of all of the other dishes we ordered was disappointing - especially the cooked items, which of which tasted seasoned at all.  Overall, for the price, it is definitely not worth it. There are much better AYCE place out there.   Did I mention that they charge extra for tea?"}
{"text":"Fancy AYCE place near the colossus theater. Serves thai and japanese food.  Actually came here for a friends birthday dinner and this place was PACKED, literally 50 ppl waiting in the lobby and bar.... we had reservations but still had to wait for around an hour (whats the point of reservations if you still need to wait for an hour??).   So the hour wait is over and we head to get seated, but since we have a big party it took some time for the waitress to get our orders in, which was ok. The problem was when the food started coming, we noticed that a lot of orders were lost, came extremely slowly or didn't come at all, which was frustrating since we didn't know if we should order it again.  The food was pretty good, sashimi was fresh. I also had a green curry that was pretty good (spicy!). But to be honest i didn't find the pricing justified ($27.99). The selection wasn't that great limited Japanese AYCE items + thai food, the expensive stuff like oysters, amaebi or uni were all missing. The roll selection was also pretty limited.  I would come here if you craved both Thai and Japanese food, but if you were just looking for a Japanese AYCE there are better choices out there with better quality and selection and for less."}
{"text":"A little expensive but good. Ordered the teriyaki salmon and sashimi platter, it was fairly fresh. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Upscale and hip decor, black walls with black velvet roses patterns and big sunken lounge armchairs, nice enough to bring dates here.   food is rather hit and miss, thai spring rolls has very bland taste,  green curry sauce is very watered down and flavourless,and did not come with the garlic bread wedges as depicted in the menu.  beef with peanut sauce is surprisingly really good, and so is the coconut shrimp. Tempura came with a relatively bland sauce that doesn't taste as good as other places. Curry pad Thai was alright,  red curry was better then the green curry with thicker and more flavourful sauce. Basil beef was a little on the salty side, almost like they were trying to hard to deliver so opted to drench the few slivers of beef in a mediocre sauce.Spicy salmon roll wasn't as bad as expected as per reading other reviewer's comments, however it wasn't spectacular, just ok, slightly soggy actually, which Is really saying something about the maki since spicy salmon is pretty basic and hard to mess up. Curry pumpkin soup was way too sweet to swallow,  mushroom soup was ok, the 2 slices of duck bacon in the duck salad salad was good.  Basically we were impressed with the decor, which for a short while colored our first few bites with rosey optimism. But as the meal wore on, and the flushes of first impressions faded, we became steadily and increasingly let down dish after dish. So we rate the restauran Decor 4/5, food 2/5,  probably won't come back again as there are better options out there at this price level"}
{"text":"Tried out Spoon & Fork in lieu of brunch on Easter Sunday. I wasn't expecting to eat Japanese food quite so soon as I had just moved here from Vancouver and had my fill of excellent West Coast Japanese fare in the weeks prior to flying to Toronto, but this Japanese/Thai all-you-can-eat restaurant is not bad. Could be more authentic and less pricey.   I enjoyed the rolls and cones, but the sashimi (salmon, snapper, butter fish) were very thinly sliced and nothing special. The satays (beef and chicken) were good, as was the street style pad thai with prawns (although someone in our group thought it tasted slightly burnt). I did not like the green curry chicken -- the curry sauce had a fluorescent tinge and you could tell it was just poured over whichever meat you chose to have with it. Must have good curry if touting Thai cuisine. Overall, S&F served better food than other AYCE Japanese restaurants of which there are many in Vancouver.  Service here was friendly and prompt, and the decor is stylish. I wouldn't go out of my way to return to S&F, although I'm not against another visit if I were in the neighborhood, particularly if I want to be stuffed for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Excellent all you can eat menu. I don't know how they can be so fast and maintain the quality that they have.ma really great place to eat"}
{"text":"Been here once for a birthday.  It is super fancy and dark inside, they have candles to lit up the table.  At first it didn't look like a AYCE place the way they decorated it.  It is a AYCE with Japanese and Thai fusion.  This place is a little more expensive than your average AYCE Japanese Buffet but with the additional Thai items I think it is worth the price. I believe it was $27.99 for a person before tax and tips other places charges around $22-23.  The service was also very good, as they tend to place their items in large plates and the tables are pretty small; the server kept clearing our plates quickly and refilling our drinks.   They have a few variety of soup and salads and the menu is quick vast.  I like the mango salad.  The quality of the fish was pretty good as well.  The portion size is smaller so you can try all the different stuff they have on the menu.  I guess it is good so people don't waste any food and can just easily re-order if they want more.  Will come back here again."}
{"text":"I was invited here for a friends lunch.  She ordered several items off the menu.  Every single item was a hit.  The tempura, edamame, sushi, pad Thai, green curry, spring rolls, and matcha ice cream were 10/10.  I have gone back many times and am never disappointed. Quick and fast service.  Staff is attentive. Decor is beautiful"}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience overall. Maybe I've become accustomed to their Vaughan location, or perhaps as I've heard from other Yelpers, that this mini chain of restaurants has met the same cost cutting, portion control demise that so many other sushi restaurants have over the years.  The decor was as elegant as Vaughan, but I found staff to be hurried and not really engaged when you spoke to them - kind of the same look you get when a server at a Kelseys looks through you and responds in perfect auto-pilot response patter. Ya it was eery.  Our wait time was fine for a Friday night (5 minutes) so no complaints there, and I really enjoyed our seat on the second floor raised area, nice to look out over the entire restaurant - and heck it was BIZZ-EEE!  My gripes come with the food, I don't mind paying $28 for AYCE sushi, but it better damn well be GOOD sushi. I thought I could rely on Spoon & Fork for this... here were the main issues:  - $28 does NOT include green tea or dessert at the end. $3 for a cup of tea - you're not Starbuck.. RELAX BRO!! - Ordered the Seaweed Salad - It was still frozen and watery - Ordered the smoked duck salad - it was salad... sans duck #Fail - Rolls - eek, where to begin. Haphazardly made, spicy rolls were more mayo than spice, couldn't even survive my chopsticks before falling apart - Sashimi - such thin cuts that two barely resembled one normally thin AYCE cut - Satay - Chicken was super dry and beef was good  One thing that really bugged me was that staff. Our server never smiled once, forgot several items from our initial order, I know it happens occasionally but 3/8 items missed on the first order? Come on! Add to that the busser was overly eager and was grabbing at dishes with food still on them - I had to tell the guy to back off twice. RELAX BRO!!!  .... Haven't you guys heard what happened to the last server who tried to take food away from a hungry Italian Community Manager? I won't go into detail but they don't call him 'Stumpy' for no reason (ha ha). But seriously - HANDS OFF!!!  I think this place needs to have a staff meeting and get back to basics, We came in at the end of the evening and felt like we got leftover end of line food, end of night rushed service, and generally were not taken care of.  Get it together folks, I love S&F so I'm all about giving them a second chance  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I will be honest, if you are expecting good sushi you won't get it here, it's not good. So many other good places for all you can eat and cheaper, save your money. However the sashimi is good and fresh. Some of the other dishes on the menu are not bad but you are mostly paying for the interior design of the place.  I would say it's  over priced. Save your money go some place else."}
{"text":"We had the chicken satay, gyoza, Tom yum soup and green curry. It was promptly served.  The waitstaff was accommodating as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been here about 4 times now. Service is very friendly & for the most part pretty fast. I like the sleek décor & the ambiance. I have tried a la carte & AYCE & both have their merits. Lunch time is nicer as it's quieter & easier to get your server's attention if you are getting AYCE. Would recommend reservations on weekends for sure & AYCE on weekends can be slow. AYCE portions are smaller and great for me so I can try a variety of things. I know that the man who accompanied me was looking for more to eat for sure...lol.  I have tried the sushi, sashimi, hand rolls, salads, some of the Thai dishes and apps and I would recommend them all. I think that they could have better descriptions for the sushi as some people aren't aware of what is inside each one.  All in all, would recommend for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday afternoon around 2pm and had their lunch AYCE menu for $17.  They have sashimi on the lunch AYCE menu which is quite rare!!!!  The appetizer options are a bit limited and I would have liked to see some Chinese dim sum options like Spring Rolls has but the fact that they have salmon sashimi makes this place all worth while.  Plus their sashimi is quite fresh too!  I also liked the fact that when you order a roll, they don't give you 8 or 12 pieces like some other places... just a few pieces based on your party size.  Service was kinda shotty though, I had to flag the waiter down a few times.    Decor was quite nice and they have free wifi too!!  Overall, I had a positive experience here and would come back!"}
{"text":"I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. First of all, the host wanted to seat me and my friend in an awkward place and when we asked to move she lied and said there is no where else to sit and we would have to wait 20 minutes. I had to find a proper seat for us and she reluctantly sat us there. Secondly, the drinks were watered down and lukewarm. The food was cheap quality and cold. Definitely stale. Let me just go through a few items. The sushi was stale, the tempura wasn't authentic, etc. Everything looked like it was sitting out for a while and/ or was not properly cooked and seasoned. It would be alright if the price was $10-15. But if they want to charge  $30 bucks, they better come correct. Mandarin is just across the street, I would recommend there."}
{"text":"For long time After eating there I could not even think of raw fish. I know it's kind of late to write a review. I was there in beginning of summer 2017. I used to go there every 2 or 3 months. Horrible experience last visit. I spend 3 weeks sick. I have proof of my medication as I even had to go to emergency Sherway Medical centre and many blood tests after being really ill. Something wrong was with the way the restaurant regarding the food preparation  ( Raw Seafood )."}
{"text":"This was quite the experience. I can't believe this restaurant is operating like this with this high of a rating. No one acknowledged us for a while when we walked in. We were initially seated at a table with a very dirty table cloth. Not given any information about how to deal with the menu upon seating, and after about 10 minutes of trying to figure it out our waitress finally came to talk to us and minimally explained. No water was given to us at the table until asked for about 30 minutes into the sitting. No wasabi or ginger were given. We had to ask for absolutely everything, it felt like everything possible that could go poorly or wrong did. Our waitress never once asked us how we were doing or how the food was. (Not very good, it was dry and the sauces tasted watered down) the amount of pepper in some of the dishes were astonishing and could not be made without it. Last call for the kitchen was at 9:30pm on a Wednesday.. We were given dirty spoons for our soup and had to go a grab a clean one ourselves. Overall this was an extremely frustrating and horrible experience. I high recommend that you do not eat here as it is very clear that the standards of service and management are very very low. Not to mention the hostesses apparel, it did not seem to be appropriate not only based off of what every other employees In the restaurant were wearing but also off of the image the restaurant was trying to portray. I will not be returning after this experience."}
{"text":"My brother had his engagement party here for a group of 30.  The food came out slow and when I approached the manager to ask why he replied that it was their cost saving mechanism so food is not wasted. That is all I will say about that. Our guests left hungry, I did not get to eat half the things I ordered on the menu and the staff was pretty absent. Menu was limited with a many restrictions. Dessert is not included in the AYCE. Too overpriced for what you get.   Overall a terrible experience which I have told everyone with ears to. The food was mediocre but the decor was amazing so if you care about your eyes rather than your mouth or belly do come here to tantalize your optical senses."}
{"text":"The All You Can Eat program here is great!  You order off the menu over and over until you are stuffed for one set price. The food is really good and the service is 5 star!  Could I complain? Yeah if I tried but why be negative?  This is a solid dinner spot well worth the money."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I had gone Spoon and Fork and I was craving some sushi so I went back yesterday. Overall, I wasn't pleased. The quality and service are both deteriorating. The venue is still nice but the price for AYCE is expensive here and doesn't include dessert or tea.. It's not really worth it. I would rather go to Sake Sushi in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"Similar to previous posts, 3 of us had dinner at the Queensway location on April 12 and all three of us were really sick for the next 3 days. So from the previous posts, it looks like something bad was definitely going on that evening. We've since reported to GastroBusters to look into it."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a AYCE table service restaurant . It's definitely good value for money . A few good vegetarian options but for the most last it's meat and fish heavy. Avocado maki was awesome! Decor is pretty nice too. Overall I wasn't blown away by this restaurant but the food was good and we had a nice time!"}
{"text":"I go to the Spoon and Fork in Etobicoke frequently (3 times in the past 2 months). I've only tried the all you can eat and I have to say that for all you can eat sushi it is very impressive.  I have also tried some of the cooked options: beef and broccoli, cashew chicken, pad thai. I would skip the first 2, but the pad thai is delish!  I am a fan of the: Spicy salmon, spicy tuna (hand and regular rolls), The salmon sushi pizza, the salmon and butter fish sashimi, all variations of their dragon rolls, the seaweed salad.   The decor is nice, the service is quick. It's usually busy so I suggest making a reservation.  Also, I love that they don't threaten to charge you for food you don't eat. I really don't like when all you can eat places do that. They politely ask that you do not over order and the portions are small enough to ensure that you order a lot of items but do not get too stuffed -- smart!"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday Dinner Story Time!  The server I had for that night was really rude and kept saying \"Are you sure you're going to finish all of this food,\" \"We're going to charge you for any food wastage,\" \"Please finish your food becuase there is a charge for food wasta- OKAY I GET IT.   Like, everytime we would order this guy would repeat the same ordeal. Why the hell would we go to a buffet that mind you is $30+ and risk already being charged more for wasting food? Also if we got it the first time, why are you being so rude as to keep repeating it as though you're a broken record???  Really put a stain in my mouth. Unfortunately today was not a good day for coconut shrimp as literally all of them, except after ordering about 10 orders they finally made an edible batch as the previous were all burnt. The crispy beef today was soggy oil served on a plate, the beef tataki had either too much ponzu sauce or no sauce, The curries had like no sauce, and the escargot was sadly mushy until we ordered like 5 more orders and then they finally made fresh ones that were boiling.  Maybe the server hated us enough to serve us bad or leftover cold food? Who knows. But the worst part is that after ordering all of our sashimi as we are a LARGE PARTY okay we're like 7 and about 4 of us live in buffets - we have bottomless pits for stomachs - the server says, \"Sorry its 8 sashimi per person which is 54 total pieces.\" Me and my siblings are going WTF???   Okay. First of all 7 x 8 = 56 so he shorter us two pieces. Second of all, EVERYTIME our sashimi ordered it would instantly be inhaled by us so we had to kept bugging the guy to push out the sashimi, that's what we came here for. And of course he was like ,\"Are you sure (you want another 54 p sashimi order)????? Wasting food will be charged.\"  RELAX MAN WERE NOT RETARDED. ALSO your squid wasn't prepared freshly/properlly today cause my mom stopped eating after she smelled the stench so. SMH on customer service and sushi today. Got so sick of the raw fish we ended up just ordering a ton of crab sticks and boiled octopus lol.  Anyways. Today was a really good day to have anything from the wok; Pad Siu 10/10, Crab Fried Rice 11/10, Short Ribs were SO GOOD tonight, Sweet and Sour Fish 9/10, Satay Chicken was SO MOIST AND TENDER (surprise surprise for the first time ever they are not dry?????).  Thanks to the chef who was on wok duty hope you had a Great Easter."}
{"text":"Cleverly named after Thailand's main eating cutlery: spoon and fork, Spoon and Fork serves up some decent Thai Food! They serve up a good range of sashimi variety for an AYCE restaurant, although the freshness of their sashimi has been called into question in my recent visits. The Oakville branch is actually a Thai and Japanese Restaurant, not a Thai & Vietnamese restaurant, so if you are looking for some good Viet, this is not the place for you!  Unfortunately, service is TERRIBLE. The restaurant is understaffed, and you are usually left hanging... I was turned off by their poor service a year ago, and have since given it a second chance, but the service is still disappointing.   One major drawback is that the wait staff gets rude if you order \"too much\" even if you finish the plate! (In my most recent trip, we ordered 2 pieces of sashimi for 6 types of fish per guest and was told by the waiter that we were ordering too much, and that their other customers may not have!! This was during lunch time. :S) On another occasion, I complained that shrimp was not fresh, and the waiter got cheeky when he refilled our water, saying that the water was 'fresh'.  Maybe Spoon and Fork is better suited for A La Carte, where you don't have to endure the bad attitude from ordering \"too much\"...   Food is decent, but service is just down the drain! (Hopefully they will retrain their waiting staff!)"}
{"text":"went with my new man and we were kissing and they told us it's a family restaurant!!! no kissing allowed!!! hahahaha  absolutely tremendously ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been a go to for my family because it's the only half-decent AYCE close by the house.  It's quite expensive for dinner time and it's not very consistent with the food.  Was here a few days ago taking my visiting relative there for dinner, and it seems they imposed a new rule for ordering Sashimi.  We tried ordering about 30-40 salmon sashimi with a variety of others, but our waiter said no you can't.  They will only put 8/pieces of each fish on a platter and maximum you can order per person is 8 pieces.  So if you want to order more, you have to finish your food first before ordering more.  When our sashimi \"bowl\" came, there were only about 20 pieces, with 4 pieces/type of sashimi.  We had to continuously call for our waiter to order more \"bowls\" because there wasn't enough for each person each round.   They might have imposed this rule to not waste food, but it was such a hassle for our group of 8 people to having to re-order so many times.  Even our waiter looked annoyed (mind you all of the servers at AYCE seem to hate their job) a constant (you-want-to-order-again-look on their faces)  It's AYCE!  Warning: Credit Card fraud.  My mother got her credit card skimmed here one time after eating.  The server took her card to the \"cash\" and then came back to say it wasn't \"working\", and she had re-type her pin.  Next statement we get, the card has been used in Chicago for gas, shopping, buying electronics.  She only used the card once at Spoon & Fork.  TIP:  Make sure you can see them, or ask for a machine and inspect the POS machine before paying. Or just pay cash.  Other than that, I recommend the beef tataki, fried coconut shrimps, beef shortribs, jumbo shrimp curry, the escargot is quite nice (drenched in butter) grilled chicken skewers, and the crab fried rice."}
{"text":"Excellent food, although pricey worth it!  I have been there 4 times since it opened.  Each time was a great experience, great food, except the last one.  We were seated in the draft of the front doors which made us cold and worst of all we can smell the cigarette smoke from just outside the door that was spewing in.  Let me just say I am also allergic to smoke and so wasn't impressed.  We were not seated at the bar but behind the bar in a booth.  When mentioning to the waitor, I didn't even finish talking and he just blatantly walked away.  Hello?  Customer service?"}
{"text":"I have heard of spoon and fork before they opened a location in my area, but never got a chance to try it due to the distance. So I was really excited to give it a try!   I went for dinner around 6:30 on a Wednesday, the restaurant was not full but it started filling up during my meal.   Food: the food is amazing! It's all you can eat japanese and Thai. Really large sushi menu + decent selection of Thai dishes. The sashimi was really fresh and the slices just melted in your month, yum! I think my friend and I only got to try about 1/10th of the menu and everything we had we liked.   Price: dinner was $26.99 per person which came out to be about $35 after taxes and tips. Slightly more expensive than your regular AYCE places.   Service: mostly attentive. Friendly servers.  I suspect the service would be slower had the restaurant been more busy.   Only con: no dessert on the menu but o was too full anyway.  Overall: highly recommended. Decor is really nice too! Next time I will go for lunch because I thought the selection was too large for dinner which made it hard not to over eat."}
{"text":"I wanted to bring my parents to a great fusion place and heard about this place. Drove all the way from Brampton and walked in around 630 to be told that it will be a half hour wait. The lady was really nice and we accepted to wait. After sitting there after an hour and 15 min I finally got frustrated and approached the lady and expressed the long wait and she said that there was another person in front of us. At that point I grabbed my parents and walked out and went to the keg across the street!! I could of done that in Brampton."}
{"text":"We love the food of this place. It's so sad that your order is not an order is just a suggestion. We order certain quantity of sushi and the bring what ever they want. You order certain food  they bring what ever they want. The service is terrible, and super slow. We wait so long with empty table between orders. We were ordering and the waiter ask us what kind of ice cream we wanted, trying to stop us from ordering more food. We are not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine just due to the sheer variety of dishes that I can have. Also each location usually features two types of cuisine, here it is Thai and Japanese. I love Japanese food: sashimi, sushi, rolls, tempura, and who doesn't love a lil bit of rice or fried noodles, in moderation of course.   The quality of the sashimi and rolls are not bad. I like their spicy salmon rolls. I would like if they can increase their rolls selection by juuuussst a few more that would be perfect. I recently tried their lunch menu, which seems to have less selection than dinner. I love my seaweed salad, can't have enough. But today they ran out of chicken wings... SERIOUSLY? No chicken wings? Such a downer. Their tempura was pretty standard, although the batter a tad thick and they give so little tempura sauce, I had to ask for more.   I don't usually order their stir fried dishes because most of them are really saucy (thick sauce) or oily. The fried rice seems to be pretty good here and pretty flavourful. The pad Thai is also pretty okay. This time I tried the Pad Seew and was not up to standard for me. The noodles seem \"old\" and stuck together. The flavour was still okay. I ordered a grapefrult tea, it was good until I realized it's the Taiwanese Yuzu jelly mixed with some hot water, it didn't actually seem to have tea in it. Also, decided to be spontaneous with a banana crepe. The crepe didn't seem fresh, way too much whip cream and not eough bananas!  The service was usually okay here but today the waitress was not really on the ball and the server bringing the food did not speak clearly each time he put down the dishes and we didn't know what anything was. He didn't seem to like his job. But the decor is nice and it's a good atmosphere and generally pretty clean."}
{"text":"HUGE fan of Spoon & Fork in general. Much like any AYCE joints, the quality isn't phenomenal, but Spoon & Fork is a bit higher in quality than most.  This location often runs out of certain items and one time took us 2 hours to get seated (even with a reservation) but, with a busy Etobicoke AYCE spot, it's to be expected."}
{"text":"4/5 slightly pricey, but decent considering they had sashimi, too bad no dessert included in all you can eat =[  Service - 2/5 super slow  Food - Sashimi was pretty decent. They had a variety of options available to choose from. They had Thai and Japanese inspired dishes. Check out their website for full menu if you are planning ahead. I would recommend trying the spicy salmon sushi  Atmosphere - 4/5 I thought the atmosphere was cool, they had trendy decorations."}
{"text":"We went today to spoon and fork after reading the mixed reviews and thought of giving it a shot. Well I can surely say that this will be the last time we go to this restaurant!  The service is beyond bad, unfriendly and slow staff..the food takes ages to come out, it's as if they have a pattern in which they bring out the food in a very slow way so you become full and don't order..staff is outright unfriendly, it's as if they hate working there..drinks are not refillable despite the high price of the all u can eat menu!  The food is quite average and doesn't entice me to visit again!"}
{"text":"The Place is opened by Chinese and to be honest its the best you can expect in oakville. They use to have a better menu for lunch all u can eat. Now their lunch menu just have cheap stuff."}
{"text":"I went to their location in Vaughan hoping I would have the same great experience at their Oakville location. When ordering our food we were told by the server several times -if you do not eat all the food you will have to pay extra. When we were in the middle of our meal, the sever decided to remind us once again about the additional cost of uneaten food. This come as a insult to my husband and I since we were centred out from all the gust who were there. We will never go back to this location again, we got better service at the MacDonald across the street."}
{"text":"If you can help it, DO NOT WEAR TIGHT PANTS TO THIS PLACE. I wore a stretchy, forgiving dress, and it was a smart move.  I came here with Kris and Edwin for some tasty AYCE. Our server was absolutely delightful. Friendly, disarming, knowledgable about the menu, she had it all.   Standout items:  - Coconut shrimp - Satay beef - Salmon sashimi - White tuna sashimi - Bangkok street style pad Thai (not mind blowing but I really enjoyed it)  The atmosphere is very classy, which almost makes me feel bad about absolutely stuffing my face hole. But rules is rules and I certainly had all that I could eat.  I will definitely be back again, and in greater numbers, too!"}
{"text":"First let me say - everything that I ordered tasted pretty good. So that's a star! Second star is awarded for the lovely environment in the restaurant. Loved the decor and the dishes/presentation. Very cool.  My reason for docking so many stars is a vegetarian one. I went with some non-veg friends and of course I ordered all veggie options. When the first round of food arrived, my yam maki rolls were right next to an order of non-veg maki rolls. In fact, my yam rolls had fish eggs on them. Gross.  They also brought one of my friends an incorrect dish. I suppose this slowed down the service a bit.  Lastly, it is nice that they offer so many vegetarian options but they are not the best. I think I had avocado/cucumber 3 ways. Would be nice to see some mango or asparagus in a veg roll - a bit more variety!  I wouldn't chose to go back here again."}
{"text":"This place serves great food. I keep going back. I truly believe this deserves a 3.5, but that's not an option. The service is a hit or miss (like a serious miss). I never expect much when I go to sushi places, but when I'm in a modern environment with multiracial servers, paying a high price for AYCA, I expect a little more.   Amongst the service, the food is good. The pieces are pretty big, so don't order with your eyes. Food comes out quick and the fish is always fresh. Sometimes the salmon is a little on the fatty side, but overall, it's quite great.   The dishes are worth trying. But they can get sort of saucy. They also serve sashimi during lunch, but you're going to pay a higher price for that."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was good. I had pineapple fired rice, and it was one of the best I have had. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here last night. It's the first time we've been to this location. The service was great and the food was amazing! Everything we ordered was perfect! The sushi was amazingly fresh and the Thai food was incredible. It's a little bit pricy but well worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"Being from Etobicoke, I can say this is the best sushi place at least on the Queensway. My go to for the following reasons;  -exceptional sushi (rich ingredients) -great decor -has an amazing sashimi section (which alot of sushi places don't ) -No ipads.....which i like. Makes the servers actually communicate with the table (call me old school but I like having that face to face interaction) -personal fav: Boston , dragon and spicy cali rolls  Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I went here for a lunch date with a friend and everything was delicious! We had the All You Can Eat option and you really get your money's worth.  I've been to a few places that are cheaper but the atmosphere makes up for the cost being a few bucks higher and the number of drinks options is well worth it too (if you can possibly fit a drink in with all the sushi)! I'd definitely go back for a classy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and easy to order. The iPad ordering also helps you keep track of what you order. We left stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Not good, will not go back.  Did the ayce and servers didn't come around and when they did, weren't friendly at all.  So many great restaurants to eat at - Do Not waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"This is one my favourite fusion restaurants. I like Japanese and Thai food, so no complaints here. Place was clean and had a nice atmosphere. There are two ways of ordering; all you can eat or a la carte. No one was feeling particularly hungry so we settled for a la carte.  I ordered the tom yum soup and yellow curry pad thai. The tom yum soup was tasty had a nice taste made of chicken stock, lime juice and a good kick of chili pepper spice. The pad thai was mildly spicy, just the way I liked it  I would recommend coming here with a group of friends to celebrate or just to have a good time."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night. I am firmly against All You Can Eat because I feel no one ever eats their share. But because our couple date wanted it, we had to get it as well...biggest mistake ever!  When we first came in, there were two hostesses that looked miserable to see us. They didn't even say anything to us until we asked for a table of four.   One of the hostess takes us to an awkward short table in the middle of a bunch of booths. Keep in mind there were no more than 5 tables with customers. We asked for a booth instead and she takes us all the way to a random booth with no one around...on top of that it was near the window so we were freezing!  We ordered our food and got served the sushi first. We asked for soy sauce and we waited and waited. No one even came to our table for a good 25 minutes (I am not exaggerating). Luckily we had coconut shrimp and edamame to tide us over. Keep in mind the restaurant was dead. There was even another woman who came by, I waved her down and she tried to ignore us. When I asked her for soy sauce she got very startled and said \"Ah, sorry you have to ask your waiter\" which was no where to be found and she even walked away...she didn't seem like she knew English very well. Like seriously? You can't help us with soy sauce and you work here??? It's been almost 25 minutes and I can't eat my damn sushi yet. Luckily this was not hot food.  We were so fed up my fiancee had to walk up far away to a waiter and get the soy sauce from her. The waitress was very nice about it though and apologized.  So we finally get the soy sauce and guess what? It's not even sushi soy sauce...  The salmon sashimi tasted weird and not fresh at all.   The rolls I had had really hard bits of tempura or rice. The pieces were inedible. I had to spit out the hard bit each time.   The Thai dishes were just okay. I have had much better food elsewhere.  In the end, waste of a night and waste of money. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere; has a classy look matching carpets, chairs, ceilings, and etc. Downside is the dessert isn't free you have to pay for it. Which sucks because the all you can eat Japanese restaurant I go to serve free desserts. Other than that great good!"}
{"text":"Out and about on Friday afternoon when we came upon Spoon and Fork. My sister had been to the one in Vaughan for lunch and said it was great (we like appetizers more than mains). It was okay, $16.00 for lunch.. sampled the curry shrimp, gyoza, sushi, beef satays, mango salad, tempura, spring rolls,... they were all tasty,... I was thinking this would be a great place to take teens for dinner... . The atmosphere is crisp and modern, the place is loud, The only issue (maybe because it was really busy) the place was messy.. our waitress had the \"What do you want .. so bored attitude. I wont be returning to this location, but I think I will definitely try another .."}
{"text":"I love their tasting lunch menu! There is so much to choose from on their menu and the staff is really nice. The interior atmosphere is welcoming as well. This is the only ayce restaurant so far that offer sashimi for lunch. Their portions are just right to allow you to try a variety of things without filling up too quickly. The quality of food is quite impressive for an ayce restaurant. The calamari is a must try! The chicken wings are probably the best in comparison to other ayce Asian restaurants. This is definitely a spot for me to visit whenever I'm in the city and honestly, the price is very good for what you get."}
{"text":"Not much variety. The only good dish here is the salmon sashimi (although very thin and small) and the beef tataki (although only one order per person which is only 4 very thin slices) . By our 5th order of beef tataki there was hardly any sauce on the beef.   Also. For an all you can eat place you only get soft serve icecream . The fried banana 6$ . Creme brulee 6.50. Even green tea icecream 4$. All you get is either vanilla or chocolate soft serve . Unfortunately tonight they only had vanilla (worked out cause it's actually goos. Like McDonald's soft serve) . Banana crepe for 7$. 80% cream . Very very sweet. Waiter said it's suppose to be like that . *shrug*   What a rip off for 27.99 per person . Limited food options. Would not come back. Only non asians people here btw."}
{"text":"I love my sushi & seafood very much and so i was very excited for this place because it seemed to have some interesting stuff on the menu.  Very nice looking place The All you can eat is 27.99 plus tax and tip(included in the bill). For this price I believe the all you can eat menu and food quality is really good. Everything was fresh and yummy, loved it. One thing that I didnt like was that drink and desert was not included.. Other Ayce places have lower places including drink and desert, but.. Alright.   The reason I gave 4/5 stars is because the server looked very annoyed and bothered and not friendly at all. The food came at good speed, but servers are supposed to be friendly and welcoming, but then again tip was included so he obviously didnt feel like he needed to put in any effort.  I would deff go here again"}
{"text":"First off I'd like to say I've waited two weeks to make this review just to give it a fair review because believe me when I left the resturant that night I wasn't happy at all.  The resturant decor and atmosphere was nice. When we first got in the resturant we were greeted and seated which was great. What wasn't great was the fact that our  table was right beside a counter that just had a mountain of dirty dishes. When the waiter came and took our drinks I asked if he could remove them because who wants to eat next to that. He told me it would be a few minutes and went on serving other people. The dish mountain kept growing throughout the night no one bothered cleaning them. The mood was Meh I've had better at the Queensway  location.  The waiter kept messing up our orders and kept what looked like flirting with his co-worker. At one point we waited for an order so long I asked to cancel it. This is what he said \"sorry I can't cancel and order once it's punched in, but I can go check and see if it was brought to another table\" and this point I just wanted to leave which with did.   If you're going to charge what you do, the service shouldn't be as bad as it was.  It's good to say I will never return to this location ever again. Which is very sad given its the closet one to me.   Thanks for the birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Pricey for ayce, won't deny that. But the selection and quality of food offered garners it for stars. Try the Bangkok street style pad Thai: quite tasty, especially from an ayce venue."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience of all my experiences there. The food was terrible. Too salty, lobster bisque was cold, I've had better fast food. Service was atrocious. Waited over thirty minutes for items only to be told that the chef forgot them but really the waiter (his name was Rex) forgot to put them in because he was so busy telling us what we should order instead of listening to what we actually wanted. Will never go back. Tried to give them another chance. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I've been to the Spoon & Fork in Vaughan once and for whatever reason it was just a nicer experience over there.  I can't put my finger on it exactly and it was a while ago but my last all you can eat experience was just about a week ago and it was just about a block away (K & B) and being that place was so fresh in my mind it's easy to say that S&F was bench marked against that.  So it was a Friday evening for AYCE (they call it all you can \"taste\") and the ordering is done via a server and they just keep bringing what you order and as much of it as you ask for.  It's a little more \"on the spot\" compared to being able to write it down or tapping on an iPad so you have to be prepared that orders will take a little longer perhaps and considering you're a group, everybody has a favorite they want to get in on that order.    The samples are small to tiny.  When ordering I found myself saying \"for the table\".  For instance I had asked for a chicken katsu and kalbi \"for the table\" for that particular request they brought 2 cutlets and 6 pieces of kalbi.  Mind you we are a group of 6 MEN.  I had to order more kalbi later which isn't so bad because you can ask for as much as you want but if you're not spacing out when to order and keeping track you can get to the point where you will run out and be waiting for a server.  Ultimately you will become full ordering food, eating it and sharing whatever comes so organization of ordering is required.  Depending on the size of your party it may be difficult for one person to do all that but I found myself being the one ordering for the group and basically it was just easier to say we'll have another order of all the sashimi we had last round etc.  This Spoon and Fork is a mix of Japanese, Korean and Thai small plates basically tapas style.  It's a lot more dishes to have to deal with but it makes sense if you're a small table to not necessarily have a large tempura plate when you can sample so much of other dishes so it's just something you have to keep in mind, the size of the plates and the amount of people you have if everybody is basically going to share the same things.  The quality of the food is about average.  Some of the dishes like unagi nigiri to me seemed like they had way too much rice to meat ratio.  I mean each sushi piece could easily have had double the meat on it because of the amount of rice it was sitting on top of...   Rolls were confusingly brought at various times.  It would have been nice to have say 2 large platters of rolls instead of say 5 individual spread out orders come at different times.  When you are a table of 6, one roll lasts a couple minutes perhaps.  Basically your experience is based on how fast the food comes and how busy it is as well because you can't simply place an iPad order and it be recognized instantly.  We still do have to flag down servers and if it's a busy night as it was for us, that could be a challenge.  Having to flag down a server changes the dynamics of how orders get put through if you're having to wait to flag a server down.  You may think I have to order more now because I don't know when we can get another order in later...?    I'm not saying it's frustrating ordering directly with a server but it's just less comfortable doing so because I'm used to writing it down (planning it out) or tapping on an iPad which is actually the easiest because everybody can take turns or pass it around.  The ordering process is basically the cornerstone of how you experience this place and what you receive is the other end.  The servers are all over the place and it's a lot of work for them to satisfy many tables but it's harder to keep track of what you didn't get sometimes.  Another person at my table had to ask for his spider roll 3 times because multiple rounds of ordering had passed and we never received it from the first round.    The meal was just under 28 dollars pre tax and the Sapporo drafts were on special for 5 dollars each which was cool.  After tax and tip it worked out to be about 50 bucks for my meal.  Not bad but not necessarily great as I can compare it to another AYCE place just down the street (K & B) which has pretty much the same ambiance but quicker and efficient service (because of the iPad ordering system) and the quality of food there in my opinion is superior.  Still, Spoon & Fork maybe a decent value for the money but to me it's just OK and not as good as other AYCE options in the GTA both for quality and/or bang for the buck.  Oh I almost forgot... not that I eat dessert because my version of a dessert is a salmon skin handroll (which they don't have sadly) but the desserts are EXTRA charge and are not included with the meal."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my cousin and her family. At first I wasn't surprised at how busy it was but I was expecting for the hostess to be a bit more welcoming.  When we got to our table, our main server was amazing! Wish I remembered his name. He was completely understanding and paid attention to what we had requested. He saw the my cousin's son tipped over his apple juice and he brought is another one right awaygood stuff! Finally a place that could handle bisu nights and provide great customer service. Food was good too and I would come back for the service."}
{"text":"It's a nice big space , perfect for office parties. For my group of over 20+ people, they seated us up in a privat-ish section at the back. My biggest peeve about the restaurant, especially on the dark and rainy day was it was WAY too dark in the place. Doesn't help with the modern black minimal decor, but I could barely see, then leaving had a huge headache.   The food for lunch was all you can eat, and tapas style. I would recommend having one person do the ordering for the table, and get multiples for your group. It would be MUCH easier on the staff and customers if they had a check sheet like dimsum. Dining with some really indecisive people , they easily forgot what was ordered and kept changing their minds.   It's not amazing the food, although many of my non-asian co workers loved it. Personally, as a discerning eater, I wasn't impressed.  Best tho, was the street style pad thai.  The regular pad thai didn't taste anything like it should.  Tempura was fine (can't mess that up), the teriyaki wasn't spectacular.  I would order up as much sushi and sashimi or rolls, as they were quite decent.   It's okay, but minus one for the lighting, I wasn't a comfy diner."}
{"text":"Girls night out here with one vegetarian, one pregnant (not eating raw fish), and myself plus one baby.   The hostess was a bit short with us, mind you we were a little late but still! The waitress was excellent though, so overall service I thought was pretty good!   There are lots of vegetarian options and they arranged all the vegetarian sushi pieces on one plate separate from the fish pieces. The waitress was careful to mention items with fish sauce or eggs in them for my friend.  Of the cooked food, the crispy beef and satay beef were delicious!  The pad Thai took a while to come and it was also good. Sauce was tangy, noodles were thin but not over cooked in the least.  Sashimi was very fresh, with an average variety available. The beef tataki was a little thick and only OK but quite tasty.   Overall I had a good experience and will likely come again.  Ice cream and tea are not part of all you can eat but good thing I read it on a previous review before we ordered!   Also the seating in the booth was a little tight, don't know if I would bring an older baby."}
{"text":"I've been going here with my fiancé for about 5 years now and we both love it. The food is delicious, the all you can eat is great, and the staff are friendly. My only comment is that sometimes water isn't filled up even when our cup is on the edge of the table and we have to flag someone down a couple times. Other then that love it !!"}
{"text":"I'd give another .5 if i could. I came here on my girlfriends request for our two year anniversary. I had been sick as hell for a week so my appetite wasn't all there but I would never back down from an AYCE. The food as an individual dish wouldn't have been ideal but as a face stuffer it definitely surpasses it's expectations. Coconut rice was OK...had I paid 4 bucks for it I'd be pissed, but I got like 4 bowls for nothing so bring it on. As we all know of course rice isn't food so I'll just move on to the important stuff.I tried all the chicken dishes and they were also pretty mediocre (again..I tried them ALL so 5 mediocre dishes = 1 great dish) The best thing on the menu was the beef teriyaki strip with that yellow sh** you dip it in, I cruised on those for the rest of the night. I finished off with the cheesecake to add to the ice cream. Not bad. Usually when I go to an AYCE there are prophecies of my coming and the moon shines red...however this time I was sick and could not fulfill my duty. I will come back for you spoon and fork."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant as I heard good things about it with the Queensway location.   So off to see the movies with my friend and I would check out the Japanese restaurant spoon and fork  Uncapped tardy outfits that were black no consistency, and staff with an attitude, thank God for the bartender Jack, food was mediocre when I complained to the waiter that my pad Thai was full of sweet sauce, well A shrug of the shoulders what can I do!!! Really!!!"}
{"text":"I think corporate should have placed less attention on the decor and put it into the food.  There is no love, no care, no interest in the food here. It tastes like conveyor belt, boxed frozen crap.   I ordered Thai dumplings - the sauce - peanut and some sweet concoction - literally tasted like a PB&J sandwich - except picture that flavor on chicken encased in disgusting, over cooked pasta that was clearly boiled in unsalted water.  Everything else was hideous: the lemongrass chicken had that thick, gloopy sauce that screams inauthentic, the teriyaki chicken had a flavor beneath it which told me it wasn't seasoned. Coconut shrimp that was pounded flat and overcooked in the fryer so they were 'tough as old boots' (thanks Gordon Ramsay). The pineapple fried rice was a joke: can someone tell me when raisins have ever been included it that dish? They threw everything but the kitchen sink in - cashews, shrimp (hey, I don't mind - but there was only one), chicken (two pieces) and thick, under-cooked green onion.  I didn't want to keep ordering but given the price I felt I should try and get my money's worth - so I just ordered edamame (which was also clearly defrosted and burned in the microwave), and spicy eggplant which could have been decent had the overly thick and salty gravy not ruined it.  Then, to add insult to injury they have the gall to charge for dessert!   Next time, I will do myself a favour and go to Mandarin - they definitely have their flaws but they're 100% better than Spoon & Fork."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. The all you can eat menu is worth trying. Courteous staff."}
{"text":"Not a bad AYCE place, but price is higher than others. Great atmosphere, but service can be slow time to time. We waited about 10 minutes without wasabi while pieces of sashimi were looking at us on the table ready to be eaten. Other times, it came with sushi, so we didn't have to ask for.   The food quality is no where close to a-la-carte sushi places but tops other cheaper AYCE Japanese restaurants; mango salad always not ripe, sashimi other than Salmon seems not that fresh, but if you want to enjoy Thai and Japanese at the same time, it's a decent restaurant.   I like their curry dishes and Beef teriyaki. Hope they don't put any chemical in there because it is so tender. Pad Thai and other dishes can be salty sometimes when they over sauce it, but tastes pretty good when it is served correctly.  EDIT: The Beef teriyaki is no longer tender and it gets smaller and chewer every time I have it. When I wrote the review 2 years ago, it was great.  Last 2 times I went, the beef has gotten smaller and cheweyer. The last visit, they put all 4 dishes on one plate. They used to serve 1 per person individually with nice presentation.  Therefore I am taking 1 star away."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic .  Decor is beautiful.  Service is pretty good, can get very busy on weekends.  I think by far the best AYCE in the area.  Good value for what you get.  It`s one of my favourite places to dine."}
{"text":"This is a really low class joint.  There is a pitiful attempt at trying to fool you into believing this a quality joint, but that bubble bursts pretty quick.  I was one of two in the place and it took 15 mins to even speak to a waiter.  I ordered a few off the all you can eat menu that has a mix of all Asian foods (never a good sign).  None of it was good.  Stale fish, badly put together sushi, dishes way over salted and MSG everywhere.  I kept ordering hoping something would work out, all the while never finishing one dish."}
{"text":"Wow so good!!! The last time I came here- I had my bff and my daughter and it was really great but I was distracted due to my daughter.    But today for Valentines lunch with my boyfriend was amazing.  You can order all u can eat or al a crate. We chose AUCE and the presentation was as beautiful and one thing I always judge is calamari- and it was perfect.  After having that first bite I knew I would love my meal.   We both dabbled with spring rolls, edamame, and sushi pizza- all were delish!   Got sashimi as my 2nd choice, fresh and nice sized portions. For my main I got general Tsoa chicken with kimchi rice. Again all tasted so good.    Boyfriend had green curry and eggplant stir fry- enjoyed both throughly.   Service was attentive and our server was very helpful with questions.  And funny too.   My new fav sushi place!"}
{"text":"If you like good Thai food and good Japanese food, go to restaurants that cater solely to either menu. If you want plate after plate full of garbage thrown at you in a loud, draughty smelly cavern, then eat here. I should have known it was going to be bad when there were hordes of ill mannered young women both outside and inside, I don't know if it was a Barbie convention or large groups of loud garish overmade up 19 year old girls are regular customers.   I've never had worse food be it Thai or Japanese, our seating was directly under an AC outlet and we had to keep our jackets on through the entire meal, and we could smell some kind of rotten fish smell from the kitchen [one can only assume that is where it was coming from] the whole meal. The service was slow and they got order after order mixed up.   Now, sorry to say, on with the food.  I started with a couple appetizers; the coconut shrimp, the stuffed shitake mushroom and the duck salad.  The coconut shrimp tasted like it was right out of M&M Meat shops , overcoated with some glutenous crap and coconut with some kind of rubbery thing that was supposed to be shrimp..., then on to the stuffed shitake mushroom - again something inside you would never know to be fish let alone an edible one. The smoked duck salad was a few piddly greens with so much balsamic vinegar on it that you couldn't taste the few tiny slivers of duck if you tried... - Tasted the Agedashi tofu my friend ordered that was tasteless except for the after taste of rancid cooking oil. Tried the lemon chicken that was absolutely awful. I've eaten in a number of good authentic Thai restaurants and I have never been served a pile of mucky onions with black sauce covering them and a couple small sad rubbery bits of chicken....just gross.. as was the sweet and sour tofu veg... almost as inedible as was the thai dumplings.. they weren't even cooked, the wrapping was dry and tasteless and there was some red garbage sauce on them that couldn't being to mask how poorly made, cooked and pressented they were.  I wouldn't set foot in another of these restaurants.. I feel sorry for Torontonians who think this is suitable fare,  perhaps it isn't such a big surprise to know restaurants like this are thriving in the Toronto area when one considers who they elect for mayor."}
{"text":"Since trying this place out a while back I have since LEARNED MORE ABOUT JAPANESE AND THAI FOOD and also....TRIED MORE.  So here is my newly updated review: My husband and I celebrated our 7th anniversary with dinner at Spoon and Fork (colossus) and yes, thank you, ...its been 7 wonderful years. =) We were so well received. The hostess looked for our reservation, sat us down and our waitress was just delightful. I drank \"sex on the beach\" because I'm a girlie girl. And we ordered all of our favorites. I still don't know where we put all that food but it kept coming and it was fresh and delicious. Also- Kudos to Asian Cuisine for being the most beautifully presented food on the planet! I added pics of everything we ate...they gave us a complimentary anniversary cake slice and were very good with the service. The food was delicious. We left happy. And we'll be back soon.  Also- our friends (at our recommendation) went on a date there and loved it as well.  The ambiance is romantic and chic, the food is good and the price is $27.99 for all you can eat. Overall, a decent deal."}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork in Oakville is somewhere I go and know I won't be disappointed. It's a mix of Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine and all of it is really well-made. The restaurant has a good atmosphere - it's not over-the-top fancy, but suitable for a nice dinner, but works if you want to do something casual as well. They have a private glass room in the middle of the restaurant that you can book for larger parties too. All the dishes are reasonably priced and decently sized. The food is made and brought out quickly - I've never had to wait more than 7 or 8 minutes after ordering. The servers are all pleasant and always ready if you need anything. Whether you choose a la carte, or all you can eat, you can't go wrong. Most (if not all) of the items on the a la carte menu are on the all you can eat menu, however, the all you can eat items are smaller portions. But this is good because you get to try more things! Plus, they have SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM for dessert! I think the only fault with this restaurant is that if you want all you can eat, everyone at the table has to get it too (i.e., if you have a party of 4 people, two people cannot order AYCE, and 2 people a la carte. The whole party has to get the same thing). However this isn't an unreasonable condition. Other than that, everything else is great!"}
{"text":"Service The service is fast however the server was condescending as we were asking a lot of questions about the menu and ordering a lot. We were a large group. The water was warm little ice cubes and we had to ask for refills.  Food For the weekend dinner menu there is no dessert which was disappointing for the price. The sake was great! The curry has different flavors according to the menu but they al tasted the same.  Ambiance The decor is nice, the kitchen is clean.    Overall decent food may find better at your local sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know why Vaughan restaurants have opted for the \"no reservations on weekends\" policy, but it makes it very hard for a party of 15+ to find a great place to eat. I am so happy that THIS Spoon & Fork does take reservations for a Saturday night! Our girl's night was a blast!  Now, having been to the Vaughan location beforehand, I must say that the Etobicoke location is a bit lackluster in regards to decor. Ambience was loud and felt crammed together. They were beyond packed on Saturday and the wait service had their work cut out for them.   We waited for our food longer than most A-Y-C-E and although they were on the ball with bringing the right orders to us it did feel like no one wanted to come by often to take further orders.   The Drinks were all pretty great except the strawberry daiquiri, tasted really sweet and had the texture of a smoothy.  The food was good. My favourites of the night: Cream cheese stuffed Jalapeño Chicken (amazing!), Escargot, and popcorn shrimp. Also the spicy Tuna sushi is awesome. And lastly, the curry chicken with coconut rice.  Creme Brûlée every time and always worth it.  I might go back just because they take reservations on the weekend and I hate waiting around for food."}
{"text":"Dined here with a small group of work colleagues.  Food was OK, but not overly impressed.  Spring rolls were doughy, wontons soggy, pad Thai was average - nothing stellar,  beef rendang had absolutely NO flavor and should be called something else - not even close to real beef rendang,  rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll were reliably good, curry pumpkin soup was good as well as wonton soup, beef with oyster sauce was probably the best item I had all night.  Dessert was soft serve ice cream chocolate and vanilla."}
{"text":"Great food, great service as servers are more than delighted to serve you.  The part that really stands out is the fact they would come and check on your table every 5-10 minutes.  I am a Thai cook and truly takes food to heart.  I do not just like food but rather love great food.  I do recommend the food and encourage many people to try the great Thai menu selections they have to offer.  The only problem with many of their Thai dishes is they all have similar sweetness from the pad thai to the coconut curry dishes.  If they can reduce the level of the sweetness just slightly and add the one missing ingredient in their coconut curry dishes, they will have perfect it.  All in all 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"The staff could've been a bit pleasant, friendly but the food was tasty and fresh. Good selection on their lunch menu . The server didn't seem that attentive when mentioned an allergy he said it was too late (within 5mins of ordering) and walked off. Luckily the manager was close and happily dealt with the mistake. He saved my impression of this place . Would return to spend some money and fill my belly."}
{"text":"The WORST spoon and fork I've been to. Terrible compared to the Queensway location. The sushi is completely inedible and disgusting--horribly stale, nothing in the maki rolls is remotely fresh. The thai is edible but absurdly spicy compared to the preparations at Queensway--their one-pepper spicy dishes are spicier than the spiciest dishes at Queensway. Service isn't great, either.  The disgustingly stale sushi is the main reason for the 1 star review. Seriously, it's comparable to grocery store bento sushi. Other spoon and forks are MUCH better."}
{"text":"This is the BEST spoon and fork location I've had the pleasure of going to. Amazingly fresh, delicious sushi, and the thai dishes e.g. noodles are also wonderful. Not much more to say--it's quite probably the best all you can eat sushi in Toronto, anything better than this would be a la carte and FAR more expensive (cough cough, Miku...) - spoon and fork's AYCE lunch price of ~$18 is extremely reasonable for the extraordinarily good quality of the food at the Queensway location.  An unexpected gem is the creme brulee on the dessert menu. It's the second best I've ever had in the world. Who would have thought an all you can eat japanese/thai fusion joint would have a remarkable creme brulee, of all things? Desserts are extra above the AYCE price, but that's fine. Oh, and their ginger honey tea is also to die for (though also not included in AYCE).  Service is usually decent at lunch, but I took a star off because sometimes the service can be quite terrible, especially at dinner time. It can be very slow, you might see your waiter rarely, and feel abandoned. Once I brought a guest here for dinner and we left and had to go eat somewhere else because we just weren't getting service and we had already spent two hours there and barely gotten anything to eat--likely a trick to lose less money on AYCE (which is already way more expensive at dinner), which is really nasty. However, my lunch visits are usually great."}
{"text":"Had high expectations coming in today. The ambience and interior are really nice, however the food was quite disappointing. The ratios are all wrong. The sushi had twice the amount of rice needed, and the rolls were overloaded with vegetables. The sashimi was okay, so that was really the only saving grace. There were no traditional desert options, which is a little ridiculous considering the price. We did find out from the waiter that they did have vanilla or chocolate ice cream, which was alright I guess. Overall just really disappointed. For the price, the quality should have been much better."}
{"text":"We enjoy a regular visit to spoon and fork, we enjoy their variety of delicious food, amazing prices beautiful decor and pretty good drink selection. We were here for lunch on a weekday, we were a bit disappointed with the fact that the place was half empty in the inside and the outside, we were really looking forward to enjoy the patio, but were upset, due to the lack of staff there was a line up @ the door and everyone had to wait, a couple of people decided to walk out and leave.... We hung out by the bar and finally got seated, it took a little while to place our orders, but once we did the food kept on coming, for under $20 we had all you can eat, delicious lunch, including Thai food, sushi, sashimi and off the wok. Overall we had a good time and a good lunch, but they really should have had more staff on board!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent location. We did not make reservations but walked in. The wait was only 10 minutes and we were seated in a very comfortable booth. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. We ended up eating through the buffet menu which was quite pricey. Being a vegetarian I wish I had done a little more research on the menu. I did not enjoy the vegetables which had an odd flavor but enjoyed all the other vegetarian options. Overall, this is great for Japanese cuisine. I personally did not benefit from getting a buffet but it is excellent for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This is my third time going there and like baseball three strikes your out. Let me explain this further. The food is good the sashimi is even great, but even if the food is great and the service lacks then you don't want to go back.   So when I went the first time and was very disappointed with the service I figured everyone deserves a second chance so we returned a second time. The second time same thing food was good service was horrible.   I decided to give them one more chance since because we live in Oakville ( by the way the Vaughn location is the best go there good food and good service) same thing good food horrible service and very negligent.   So this is the last time the ever see me there. One more thing the manager there is rude and has poor manners. How can a restaurant's service be any good if the manger himself has poor customer service. I told him that our waiter left us without coming back for 12 mins yes I actually times it and he didn't even say anything when I complained to him.   Bottoms line they lost me as a client is rather take a drive up to Vaughan"}
{"text":"For an AYCE Japanese and Thai this place is pretty solid. At the end of the day, it's an AYCE, so don't expect stellar quality. Still, it was a pretty solid experience. For reference, the went on a Wednesday evening at 8pm.   Pros: - Food came out fast. I didn't have to wait long for food.  - Butterfish is part of their sashimi offerings - Service was attentive - They don't overload the rolls with rice  - All but one of our orders arrived but we were full so it was probably for the best  - They have a reasonable selection of Japanese and Thai food. The lemongrass soup was tasty.   Cons: - For dessert, they only had soft serve ice cream (albeit it was good ice cream) - I'm always tempted by the Chili Chicken but both times I've regretted it.   All in all, while I wouldn't make the trip just for AYCE here, it was OK."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service can be pretty terrible. I find a lack of attention given to our table, often left waiting between AYCE orders. Once the waiter seemed to be rushing us out and I felt it was impolite."}
{"text":"A really odd restaurant / buffet. This was definitely a restaurant that had confused me. While walking in, the restaurant looked quite nice in terms of decor, but there was something a bit off with the service, and this had nothing with the service being bad, it was something else.  It was the collision between what seemed high brow and looked like any other decent restaurant from the exterior, the execution of the food gave me mixed feelings.  While the wait staff were absolutely marvelous in handling orders and making is feel taken care of, were more than enough hiccups that made me nervous outside of their enormous menu.  Literally, it was a free for all, in terms of guests putting in their orders. I could only imagine what their kitchen was like to be able to rush out each dish. I can't see how they can sustainably deliver that many dishes with the buffet / all you can eat concept intact.  I wish them luck and hope they can continue delivering great service and food combined with their buffet offerings for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here because the food WERE delicious. I don't know what changed but the food now taste so blah and the service (where was the service?) I don't even think we seen the waitress more than three times. Not even when we need our water refilled.   No longer a customer."}
{"text":"Relatively new Spoon & Fork in the Woodbridge area.  Some would say Japanese & Thai Cuisine don't mix at restaurants but the scenario differs when it's AYCE Dinner($24.99).  Design of the space is elegant, chic bar lounge vibe at least front of house while the back has more formal intimate dining space.  Impressive enough especially for the 75% or more Female clientele on a Friday evening.  *Hint* for the guys to take the ladies.  Menu is standard Jap & Thai expectations as you're given a choice of either a-la-carte or AYCE.  We went Sashimi crazy on the Jap while Shrimp crazy on the Thai as the service was very good with taking orders and topping up water glasses.  Food is served fast as I never waited more than 10 minutes for an item.  The most surprising factor was the excellent quality of Thai menu items which were all flavourful, served fresh and hot.  Spicy levels definitely has the right zing.  Maybe if I were to note a con from the pros, the Pad Thai Rice Noodle were undercooked quite al-dente.  Other than that, I enjoyed most of everything ordered.  Satay Chicken, Calamari, Curried Pumpkin Soup, Sushis, Makis, Takoyaki, Tempuras, Sashimis, Tamarind Tiger Shrimp, Spicy Seafood, Thai Red Curry Sauce Fish, Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai, Crab Fried Rice, etc...  For Dessert - Mango Salad(?).   That's cause dessert/drinks are not included within AYCE.  I felt sad for S&F cause I took them to the cleaners. I felt sad for myself most of all since my friends called it quits after 2hrs. It felt like the Neverending Story ending too early for me. Unfinished business needs to be taken care of. Otherwise known as I'll be back for AYCE Lunch($15.99)."}
{"text":"Had a lunch date with some friends here. In a large mall, I was easily able to find a parking spot in the lot. Fork & Spoon is a large restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have both a buffet (tasting menu) and a la carte menu. I wanted to go for the latter, but we were told that a table could not have separate dining options. Since my two friends wanted the buffet, I agreed to go for this option as well. This place is a combined Thai-Japanese restaurant (interesting combination to say the least...). The food was okay; we ordered a number of Thai dishes along with rolls. Service was okay for the most part (we had to remind our server about things we wanted 2, 3 times while being told that we were expected to finish everything on our plate). At the end, our server became MIA and then we had to call someone else for our bill. Not sure if I'll be back here, but it was good to hang out with friends.  Good for: groups, buffet"}
{"text":"Love the fact that I could get sashimi on the AYCE menu. The interior is modern, open, and simple. Staff are friendly, quick, and not awkwardly standing somewhere waiting for a customer to request them. Food is fresh and presentation is lovely. Absolutely recommend everyone to Spoon & Fork!"}
{"text":"Food was great for the price point. Went there with my boyfriend for his birthday. We had the all u can eat lunch special.  Service was good but it seemed like it was a bit understaffed."}
{"text":"The place looks fancy but the food quality was poor. All sushi rice wasn't seasoned and didn't feel that fresh.. Thailand street style pad thai? was pretty good but it wasn't worth of how much we paid for. Don't think going back there again."}
{"text":"My summary: don't go on a weekend.   The story: I went last night with my partner and the restaurant was decently busy, but not so busy that we had to wait for a table. The experience we got however, was vastly different from when we had gone only a couple months prior on a weekday.   The good  Their sushi is good quality and tasty.  Their menu is well diversified with Thai and Japanese items.  The restaurant is also nicely designed.   The bad  Our waiter was either feeling rushed or was new or something, as he made mistakes and was wrong about items on the menu. Nice guy, but these are some pretty rudimentary things to get wrong.   Our plates were inconsistent. We ordered the same things multiple times and got different quantities and styles every time. For all you can eat it's quite imperative that you know how many pieces of sushi you're getting every time.   The tiger shrimp is a lie. It is not tiger shrimp.   My overall opinion  I wish we had consistent experiences. When we had gone a few months ago on a Wednesday we had a great experience. The waiter was attentive and got our order right, the food wasn't a question mark every time, we just had a much better experience. My advice, don't go on a weekend."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for me. There's something for everyone.  Great setting and decor. Definitely worth the price. Especially if you're hungry."}
{"text":"This is a blander version of Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese food.  I only tried their Thai dishes, and felt they were light and good with fresh ingredients, but that there is better Thai food around.  If you are trying to please a large group of people, it's a good place to get a variety of flavors and foods.  The green curry was creamy with coconut milk, and pretty spicy/hot, although I felt it was missing some of the curry flavor.  The shrimp in tamarind sauce was disappointing, full of large sweet tamarind pods that no one really wanted to eat (they seemed to just take up space that could have been filled by sauce or shrimp) and whole cherry tomatoes which had no flavor.  The spicy chicken basil was not spicy, but I was glad that it had plenty of fresh veggies and basil, although the chicken was dry and overcooked.  The pad thai with shrimp was the best of the dishes I tried, flavorful and not oily or greasy at all."}
{"text":"Seems like the pricing went up since I came before.  Food quality was also not as great.  The salmon Tataki wasn't even seared and I think they forgot to grill it.  I will admit that I am a bit upset that no discount or dry cleaning was offered when the waiter tipped over an entire new glass of white wine on the table and partly on me.  No manager came to address the situation.  So all in all, not a great experience here tonight."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday because we wanted a more \"upscale sushi restaurant\". All parties must order AYCE or all must order a la carte. For AYCE, it's not a huge selection of food, but the portions are huge. I think I was only able to try a handful of menu items before I got full. There's definitely a ton of other AYCE places that I would better recommend in the area. $20 for lunch and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Bad service, very rude manager...  We went there yesterday for lunch with our friends. We had very bad experience, the girl who served our table had so much attitude. All of us went for all you can taste, apparently the green tea wasn't included in the menu and she didn't mention anything. As usual, in all other restaurant that green tea is part of all you can eat, we order 8 and she brought 9. Also, dessert wasn't included either and it was $17.99 for lunch only:( At the end when we found out not only green tea wasn't included also it was $3... Too expensive for a cold tea.... When we asked for manager, here he comes with double attitude of waitress and so rude... He said we are who we are and I can't do anything about it. We told him that she should at least mentioned that its not included. When you go for all you can eat you assume everything but alcohol is included, especially for such a pricy lunch..... Anyways we were kind of shocked by his reaction towards us and the way he talked... So disrespectful... We never gonna come back there and don't recommend it to anyone. The food wasn't good either, not fresh at all.   Bad service, not very fresh food and defiantly rude manager."}
{"text":"This place is uber fancy. Everytime I've been, I've seen oversexy wealthy eastern europeans just lounging.  Its a great place though, sexy decor, and sexy furnishings.  You definitely wouldn't think it's an AYCE place, and sometimes, I feel like I shouldn't be going all roman vomitorium on the food here.  The food is really good, its mostly the same as other Sushi Bars, with the focus on Thai cuisinie as well.   The basil beef and chicken is soo good. And the skewers. NOM ON ALL THE SKEWERS.  It's not the best, but it comes close.   The only issue I have with this place is that it's way expensive.   I'll probably be back. I like this woodbridge area anyways."}
{"text":"This has become the standard for All You Can Eat style sushi restaurant but you pay a price for it as one should  The weekend dinner menu is $28 pp but well worth it because the food quality is higher than the norm  You cannot offer quality food at $12 pp  The food menu includes Thai and some Chinese dishes as well  The place is super busy and is a very upscale restaurant in style and accommodations  I order always off the Chefs Special so there will be sashimi, chirashi, Butter Fish Tataki (excellent). They refer to your time spent sampling all the small dishes as All You Can Taste and this place is ideal for that.   The gourmet tour will have you enjoying soup, salads, grilled teriyaki items, wok items that encompass Pad Thai and many Thai dishes, rice and noodle dishes, Curry (Red, Green and Yellow), sushi and sashimi items  So after sampling your way around the gastro asian tour and stuffed to the gills like a largemouth bass you will forget that the price does not include any dessert. Trust me you will enjoy a 5th butter fish portion in place of any red bean ice cream.   What attracted me to this place was the fact its under the same ownership as the Prince Sushi on Eglington. I enjoyed that place immensely over the years so I figure they had real street cred for a AYCE place  I enjoy eating here with a group so that we can order every dish almost and share the small plates and reorder the ones we love the most"}
{"text":"We always go here every time we have occasion like birthday,anniversary etc. Last night it was my birthday and decided to do buffet,And they should realized fir the price of there buffet not much selection! And the waitress didn't put all our order,always something missing.. its just not worth it!"}
{"text":"Got to get rid of the sushi on the all-you-can-eat menu.  Somewhere in the history of Asian restaurants people felt that the only way you can get a popular Asian restaurant is if you also have sushi.  The only problem?  Having crappy sushi is no good!  So... May I propose a novelty in the Asian food business?  AYCE Thai and Japanese. The non-sushi items on the menu are AWESOME. They're so well done.  So tasty.  Expect nothing if you're going to get the sushi .  And restaurant, take note . Save the money on the raw fish order and just focus on what you're good, and unique at."}
{"text":"Great food but make sure to make reservations, they will definitely stick it to you if you do not."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best AYCE sushi restaurant I've been to. It's quite expensive for dinner time, but totally worth it. Appetizer after appetizer, roll after roll, sashimi after sashimi, the food was consistently good and surpassed expectations.   The restaurant itself is beautiful, lots of space and always full of happy customers. The service was great - upon learning it was our first time there, our waiter graciously explained every aspect of their buffet experience, leaving no questions unanswered.   It was definitely worth the drive to Etobicoke to try it out, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is acceptable, however the wait staff was terrible. This is not a kid friendly place - they kept giving us weird looks and eventually gave terrible service."}
{"text":"It's a Spring Roll chain spinoff!! The restaurant has one of nicest interior and atmosphere that I have ever seen or experienced. But the food quality is so bad compared to the price that I don't even want to come back anymore.  We had a big group and almost everyone was complaining about their dishes. They were bland and plain in taste. Most of the thai dishes were below par. The worst was their pad thai.  I don't know about their AYCE sushi quality but their ala carte dishes definitely are bad."}
{"text":"If you love Thai food then Spoon & fork is definitely worth going to!  Spoon & fork offers a diverse menu with a fusion of Thai and Japanese food. They have an all you can eat menu as well as a normal sit down menu. I have done both before and I do suggest to do the AYCE especially if you're with a big group just because you get lots for almost the same price you would pay for one or two items on the menu. The AYCE does not include drinks or dessert but trust me you will not leave hungry. They have so much variety and don't skimp out.  They're atmosphere is chic and classy and is great for a date or even just hanging out with friends.  One of the dessert items you have to try is the deep fried cream cheese ! It is to die for !! It's very light and fluffy and just melts in your mouth !  I definitely recommend spoon and fork and give this place two thumbs up !"}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork has a nice variety of food! The staff is usually pretty good here, but I don't know if the price is worth it. I remember going here back in the day and it was 100% worth the extra dollar, but I feel as though the food quality has dropped off a bit."}
{"text":"Reasonable price for buffet lunch at $17 plus tax and tips. Sashimi salmon is good. Spicy seafood, salmon teriyaki and butterfish - loved them. Call ahead to reserve seats."}
{"text":"I was craving coconut soup for dinner, so i wanted to try Spoon & Forks again. It was close to home, and I finally convinced my boyfriend to try sushi!   Atmosphere: stunning venue. Hard to believe they serve AYCE. Cleanliness: tables didn't appear to be clean. Glass table top and underneath in the table corners there was tons of crumbs from the last persons meal.  Constructive criticism: We waited over 5 minutes before we were ackowledged. Once a hostess seen us, she went to look for a waiter to bring us to our seats.  Cuisine: Asian Facilities: I didn't go. Food: Super upset they no longer serve the Coconut soup even though their online menu says they do!!!! So we ordered  off the AYCE menu and had: Coconut Shrimp, Edamame, Wonton Soup, Miso Soup, Hiyashi Wakame salad, Mango Salad, Salmon Sashimi, Dynamite Roll, Spicy California Roll, Beef with Oyster Sauce, Pineapple Fried Rice, & Green Curry. The Green Curry was the only dish i liked! Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: I wouldnt return here again because the price was too high!  Parking: private.  Portion Sizes: Small! Price: For 2 it was $67.10 - Like seriously?!?!?! Service: We asked to be moved to a booth and we got a frustrated look. Selection: If you're going to spend the money on Sushi, go to a better AYCE place. Better yet, dont eat AYCE, spend that money on ah la carte!"}
{"text":"The place is absolutely beautiful especially considering it's an all you can eat. The menu is very diverse with everything ranging from appetizers such as coconut shrimp to sashimi and grilled entrées. Things are ordered on an à la carte basis, taste excellent, and the service is great. If you're looking to just have a drink they've also got very nice selections on their drink menu for very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey but there is a wide variety. It is a Thai and Japanese cuisine. Everything on the menu is good. Can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. Restaurant is a little fancier than your regular AYCE sushi. Great atmosphere! Only sucky thing is that they do not do reservations on the weekends and they are always packed!"}
{"text":"Amazing super fresh sushi! Wide variety of dishes and every single one was super flavourful & fresh.   I frequent all you can eat sushi places in Toronto so I don't wanna say I'm a sushi snob but.... I'm picky with freshness & quality. They were on point. I ordered pad Thai (best I've ever had- even from authentic Thai places such as Khao San Road - which is terrible service by the way- don't go there) edamame (not too much salt not too little) gyoza (fresh, crispy, delicious), peppered beef (super fresh & came with grilled veggys) & finally we ordered almost every roll on the menu & some red wine. Absolutely unreal.   Another great point is for the size of the place they delivered your food pretty quickly.   Amazing atmosphere also very intimate & quiet in the section I sat in, but I can see bringing a group here also.   I will DEFINITELY be coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"So after skimming through the reviews from here, I found that the trend is don't go with a group of people, because apparently it's a struggle for this location.  We were a party of 5,  who dined a la carte. We each ordered our individual mains and appetizers. I had the vegetable gyoza and the vegetable pad thai which was actually pretty good. The rest of my co-workers seemed to have enjoyed their food (fried wonton, tom yum soup, chicken pad thai and pineapple fried rice). So we were having a great time, until this waiter man who came out of no where reaking of smokes and asked if we were done eating and asked if he could wrap up my food. After that everything went downhill cause they made it obvious they wanted us OUT, for whatever reason.   Our reservation was at 7:30, didn't get our food until 8:00 ish and literally got kicked out by 8:45...  It was a short lived experience, but common have some kind of decent service."}
{"text":"The service here is crap! It wasn't until the very end that the server was nice. They aren't family friendly and don't have a changing station in the washroom just a bench. The food was nothing special though the escargot was good."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister for her bday.  It is an AYCE resto with Asian cuisine but i found the food to be all one note.  The decor was beautiful and I noticed a Buddha on the wall which has a place in my heart.  Brownie points for that LOL  All in all it was fine but the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"We have been in this restaurant many times. Food quality is acceptable. The menu diversity can be better than this. I would say the personnel attitude was not good at all. Although this happened only once"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Went on someone's suggestion with my brother and parents. In our ignoramusness we forgot to make reservations on a Friday night. It took about 30-40 mins to be seated. Had the \"all you can taste\" dinner - did a whole lot more than tasting :D  Food: Delicious! There is an extensive menu (see website) for $28/person. They say they will charge you for anything you don't finish so we tried :S   From the apps, really liked the coconut shrimp. The tempura was good, standard. The mango salad was excellent, and we went through quite a few of them - super fresh. I liked the curried pumpkin soup - different and yummy, but spicy.  We all shared the spicy salmon, dynamite and rainbow rolls, which were fine. My brother had the butter fish and salmon sashimi and barbecue eel, which he liked. The beef tataki and salmon pizza were good too.  From the entrees, the salmon teriyaki was good. The chicken in green curry was alright, but the red curry was delicious. The pepper beef was outstanding, and so was the thick curry tiger shrimp! We also liked the tamarind tiger shrimp.  Service: VERY good. The order was taken and delivered promptly. Our server made several helpful suggestions. It would be a plus if the restaurant could include complimentary green tea which many Asian restaurants do, considering the price.  Ambience: upscale. Several couples seemed to be there for an anniversary or date night. There were groups more casually dressed as well. We were pretty casual and did not feel awkward, so it should work either way.  Tips: make a reservation. Apart from the curries food is not super spicy (just fine with my palate!)."}
{"text":"Been coming to this restaurant since day one!   Always receive GREAT food & service- and have Visited many many times.   My all time favourite Thai/Japanese food and I love that it's AYCE"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi. Not a ton of variety. Seems fancy when you walk in but the price is decent. Went for lunch twice. On the third time, I got food poisoning. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Try the restaurant at your own risk. The food's OK. But the wait. OMG! It's simply not worth the effort with so many equal, if not better, choices available in the area. If you walk in hungry, you'll starve before a morsel appears on the table..."}
{"text":"Checked this out last night with some creep I know, we got the All You Can Taste menu and I was really blown away by the quality of all the food. I'm always wary of places that try to do too many different kinds of cuisine and/or have All You Can Eat offerings, but everything was really top notch.  Great, fresh sushi, rich, flavorful thai food.... out of the approx 30 dishes we ordered only one or two were medicore, the rest were really delicious.  Will definitely be coming back to try out some other dishes and to revisit some of the favorites from last night.   Service was also fantastic, very attentive and friendly, which was unexpected."}
{"text":"I wish i could give it no stars!  My Advice is don't even bother eating there. I made a reservation for my boyfriend and myself last week for his birthday. We arrived there 15 minutes before or reservation and waited 10 minutes for someone to come and greet us. Then when the manager finally came he served someone who came in after us because he knew them and sat them right away. He then asked us to wait 5-10 minutes for a table, fine it was busy I work in the restaurant industry so I understand. We waited about 15 minutes and then someone went up to them because apparently they had been waiting a long time and he actually yelled at them and asked them to be patient. He was rude, not apologetic and was avoiding everyone. We then waited another 15 minutes (30 minutes in total now!) and decided to leave. What was the point of a reservation? whats the point in waiting if you receive awful customer service from the MANAGER?!  Its not the first time I have experienced bad service there. Its the THIRD time and it's always always always the manager. The manager is not a nice person and really needs to learn some manners and customer service skills. I will NEVER eat at that spoon and fork again, I will drive up to Vaughn instead because we always get 100% better customer service there.  I wish there was someone I could complain to but unfortunately he is the manager. AWFUL!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've ever had... and yes I've been to Salad King!  And my girlfriend agrees!  They have several types of Pad Thai, including a curry version.  The food was served piping hot, which I love!  The service is good if you don't like to be bothered or have any sort of chat with your server.  Sometimes that's nice too I suppose.  And now for a few negative comments.  I have been here twice... the first time they got my Pad Thai order wrong and I had to send it back (shrimp versus chicken).  The second time I went I ordered their Spicy Seafood (Pad Phed Talay) which was pretty decent but the calamari, which was 60% of the seafood in the dish, was quite hard and way overcooked.    Otherwise, there were no problems... and the decor is quite fun.  I like their spoon and fork art~"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday around 5pm. Very nice place. Very quick service. All dishes very delicious. Fresh fish. Lots of variety. Friendly stuff."}
{"text":"I had my expectations set pretty high given the trendy look of this place, but perhaps too high. While the food was good I somehow expected more. Nothing was great and aside from my one visit I haven't been inclined to go back."}
{"text":"Don't ask me what the food is like, I didn't get to eat any.  We waited at the front for 9 minutes without any acknowledgement until finally we tried to get a servers attention, to which we were told \"hold on, host is coming\" at which point we promptly left.  I've never walked out of a restaurant before but dear lord...if you don't want business why not just set out some land mines and place some snipers on the roof. The problem is how the restaurant handles it's orders.  As an all-you-can-eat the customer has to place an order with server each time they want a new dish. This is absurd and gives each server 10 times the amount of work as a server at any other restaurant. Take a tip; invest in some of those ipads every other subpar, low end sushi restaurant (like this) has, then maybe you can keep a host at the door."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed with this place as the one in Markham maybe not as nice but it's like this location was technologically failing. The other location had an iPad and was easy to order. This location had written down so only half of what we order really only makes it to the table. The food sashimi wise was decent, but anything fried or beef was beyond oily. It was disappointing drinking the oil off the foods.   Their salad and rolls were great and deserve recommending to others and their soft serve ice cream was refreshing. Service was mediocre and having to pile up plates at the end of the table was really annoying with servers that serve food but do not remove excess plates.  I probably won't come back to this location again. But the plus side of coming here is a 10% discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant quite a few times over the past 3 years. The food is okay, but the service is always hit and miss.  Then I tried to order takeout and have my wife pick it up on her way back from work... The hostess didn't record my pad thai, made my wife drive back to pick it up, and then refused to comp us after wasting 30 minutes of our time.  Big fail - won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister last night, after a day of shopping in Buffalo.  We arrived around 9:30, service was winding down.  We ordered a bunch of food - AYCE at 27.99/pp makes you want to do your very best to make the most of the menu.  Our faves were the tuna pizza (they come in bite sized pieces), the beef tataki hands down was better than the butterfish tataki and the salmon tataki.  For sashimi, we ordered salmon, butterfish, white tuna, unagi and ebi.  We also tried the spicy salmon and spicy tuna sushi.  We ordered a rainbow roll, and a spicy salmon roll.  Both were delish!  We also had yam and shrimp tempura, and ordered some green curry with coconut rice.  The curry was delish as well.  We left in a food coma.  There was no room for dessert anyway, so the fact that it wasn't included didn't bother me at all.   It was pretty good for AYCE in my opinion."}
{"text":"I think this place was ok.  But I guess I've never been to the Vaughan location.  Really I'm slow with reviews and I'm pretty sure we came here for mother's day.  It was really busy but the staff was reasonably attentive.  It was nice and loud so any noise kiddo was making went unnoticed by other diners (always a plus).  And the food was ok.  Can't complain."}
{"text":"It was just ok. not great. better than most buffet I've been. reasonably priced. This would be a good alternative to Mandarin Buffet."}
{"text":"Fresh quality Japanese-Thai buffet restaurant at a great value!  Lunch: $15.99/person Limited time offer: http://www.spoonandfork.ca/oakville/images/oakville_beaver.pdf  Decor: Gorgeous. It's modern, fresh, clean, chic... without breaking the bank.  Service: Pretty good. Very attentive considering we were sitting at an area away from the main dining hall.  Food: Sashimi is fresh with a good variety for a buffet. Fried Rice and stir-fry noodles were really good. Some dishes are much spicier than others. From what I was told from my Malaysian and Singapore friends, the dishes are quite authentic. The beef basil stir fries were one of my top choices along with the shrimp fried rice. My favourite was the mango salad.  Con: no dessert, but who has room for it when you are stuffed from all these other dishes?  I hope they keep the offer for a bit longer, 'coz I would love to go back for more. For thought, I didn't come out of this restaurant being very thirsty so, I'm happy to know that the use of MSG is limited or none."}
{"text":"I went the first year they opened and it was the best   Went again 4 years later and food was horrible, cheap crab and lobster meat, grilled chicken and steak were over done so asked for it to be cooked but not over done and it came back burnt again  Sushi has gone down hill seaweed has weird taste to it and rice was dried up, this is all on a Saturday when it was completely packed and people waiting at the door   Never again will we go here, looks like other people have the same complaint"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to frequent this location often. In the first 2-3 years from opening,  they were fantastic. Service was friendly, food was fresh, and everything was just nice.   Now,  the quality of the food has deteriorated, and although the staff is still friendly, they get orders wrong more often.  We were disappointed greatly in our last visit, and don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overall pretty bad experience.  Pros - nice interior design... That's about it.  Cons - this place was PACKED we had to wait for 40 minutes for a table  -this place is WAY over priced  - the waiter only came to our table twice in 1.5 hours.  - not much selection - waiters not very friendly -I had an allergic reaction to the cucumber rolls. Not sure what the heck they put in it but last time I checked there's only supposed to be rice seaweed and cucumber... My mouth was burning and my throat started closing up. Not very fun!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a weekday. Price was reasonable and the service was pretty good, I would say service better than most AYCE.   Sashimi was the best thing on the menu. It was clear they froze the fish, but that's inevitable when you operate a restaurant business. Good selection and they cut it quite nicely.  Rolls were not that good. Even the sushi - I did not enjoy the rice on it at all.   Appetizers were decent. My favourite was (oddly enough) the samosas! Tempura was horrible...escargot was good. Basically anything non Japanese tasted good to me.   Pad Thai and fried rice were good, the curry was not.  I probably won't be back. I prefer their Vaughan location.. But I guess it's worth a try."}
{"text":"If you're into dining with your eyes rather than your mouth, this place is a gem! Elegantly styled from decor to the plate it doesn't fall short on presentation.  The food however is just like every other AYCE, short of authenticity , flavor and uniqueness, but it is quite visually appealing, so your brain might just be tricked.  Mine wasn't, but I couldn't not admire the effort.   Point-blank: Hot date - Spoon and Fork, Mom and Dad - Mandarin!"}
{"text":"Awesome to order buffet, great atmosphere and service. Reasonable price point in a convenient location. Food quality was above average. 5 star."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. The sushi fell apart even before we picked it up and tasteless. The sushi is no where near fresh. Some of the sashimi and raw fish pieces in my rolls were still frozen. It crunched in my mouth... a really unpleasant experience. The escargot was drenched in so much oil/ butter that I had to use my napkin to blot the excess grease. It was nauseating. The curry and pad thai I ordered was bland. There are other all you can eat places that are far more superior in taste and quality nearby. It was too expensive for what it was. Two stars because the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a weekday for lunch. Store was not so busy but we waited almost 40 minutes until our food finally got to the table. One of the server even ignored us and turn her head away when we tried to ask about our order. Two stars for the food. Zero for service. Avoid this place if you are on a tight lunch hour."}
{"text":"The Spoon and Fork on Queensway was surprisingly well done. They have several locations across the GTA and Toronto, but follow the same kind of style. Very nice decor and a bit of a fancier Asian infused style. Though not all of them are AYCE, this particular location is.  Menu is Asian fusion as they have a lot of items from Thai and Sushi to some french and Japanese items. They had some pretty interesting items for lunch such as escargot and even sashimi, which is great. The sushi here isn't the greatest, but it was definitely pretty good for AYCE. The hot foods are surprisingly very good. They have items like Thai skewers and lots of different chickens, beef, and pork dishes. One of my favorite items happened to be Thai Basil Fish which was actually very meaty and cooked well. Lots of nice surprises from Spoon and Fork.  They have a very nice patio and the service is friendly. I came during the week for lunch so the price was $16.99, which wasn't bad at all considering the quality of the AYCE and the ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"Sorry if this seems cut and pasted - it's because it is.  I originally wrote this on a forum. ---  Went to Spoon & Fork last night with a friend, it was the first time having sushi for both of us.  I must have looked like a complete slob, dressed in a baseball hat with track pants and everything, I wasn't expecting it to be all dim and fancy on the inside haha.. And I really don't think our server liked us much at ALL hahah, oh well  The big irritants of the night: $27.99 x 2 for dinner with NO drinks included, it wouldn't surprise me if they don't give out ice water for free either. Order a soft drink for $3 and there's no refills included? Give me a break... Waiter was probably lying to us.. I just drank beer instead, Sapporo actually at a hefty $7.50 a piece.   Asked where the desserts were on the menu and the guy said it's on another menu, and is not built into the cost. Like really? The other AYCE menu's I had looked at from other restaurants online always included some kind of desert section. Not at Spoon & Fork  We asked the guy what kind of sushi to try as 2 people that have never had it before and he quickly recommended \"green dragon rolls\", we had, in order: green dragon rolls (my favorite of the night, but possibly only because we had these first and at our hungriest), then spicy california rolls (also good, thought i was gonna hate these due to fake crab), then salmon sushi , then ebi sushi (shrimp), then spicy salmon sushi (this one was awful. i could barely get it down.. worst of the night. way too much seaweed and something crunchy in the middle, yuck), then yam rolls (second least favorite).   To be honest I really didn't find the salmon sushi or ebi sushi to have a whole lot of flavor, somewhat bland. I would dip them in a bit of soy with wasabi and those were the dominant flavors by far.. They were good but certainly didn't blow my mind. I also think the rice wasn't 100% proper, i have a feeling it was packed too densely or not cooked 100% right, from what I'd seen in pictures or tv shows before. These balls of rice were like someone squished the bejesus out of them in the palms of their hand  other dishes were the coconut shrimp (delicious), curried pumpkin soup (delicious), chicken wings (horrible), mango salad (fine), pineapple fried rice & bangkok pad thai (decent but already familiar with them from JJ Thai), green curry  overall there was good and bad with the place but i really think they are gouging by not offering refills and not offering desserts, the only way to come even close to eating your moneys worth is probably to only order the most expensive or exotic fish items.. my bill was way more than i was expecting it to be at the beginning of the night  Are those \"Green Dragon\" rolls unique to this place? I think there's probably much better value to be had at a smaller place, but that's just an impression I get as a novice  Will not be returning.  $100 bill for 2 people with no desserts and not even a measly free refill included?  Screw that.  Service sucked.  Waiter was rude."}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork? Umm I didn't see any of those utensils, all I had were chopsticks.  So after a few recommendations from friends saying that I have to try this place, I must remember not to listen to them about food advice ever again. The one thing that turned me off in the beginning was the price, $24.99 for ayce dinner that doesn't include free refills on drinks or dessert. Not a great start, if I'm going to spend that much on ayce I rather go to Mandarin, at least I know I'll get crab legs or lobster for that much. Did I mention I'm not a fan of Mandarin. Just saying!  There was a few things that did stand out, one being the interior of the restaurant. The decor was nice, the black and white theme for the restaurant is a nice touch and the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling makes it seem more of an upscale place. I did not like the lighting at all in the restaurant as it was getting dark. For lighting the waiter lit a candle for our table, how romantic, NOT! When you're at a restaurant with four guys you definitely do NOT want a candle light dinner, nice concept for couples but definitely not for friends.  On to the food:  Maki rolls and Hand rolls were okay, I like that there wasn't that much rice, but the fact that they were very cold turned me off. It kind of reminded me of the rolls you would find at a grocery store or an asian supermarket, not very tasty and cold.  Sashimi was a little hit or miss. There were times where it seem like it was very fresh and then there were times where it was still frozen.   The beef and chicken dishes were hit or miss. One of the beef items that they served us, beef teriyaki, tasted like liver according to one of my friends. I haven't had liver since I was young so I had no idea what he was talking about but I will account that the beef was horrible.  Thai dishes were also a hit or miss, the flavour in some of the dishes were flat out amazing, while others left this horrible after taste. The pad thai reminded me of thai express in that it was almost the same which is kinda sad coming from a restaurant.   Service was very good at times, I did notice one thing though with the servers and that was they only came to our table when we finished our food. So before we could order any more food we had to finish the food that was on our table first. I guess they've had a very bad experience with people not finishing their food and ordering so much.  Would I come back? NO! If someone were to have a birthday here or something that's probably the only time I would and I would not get the ayce.  Items to definitely get  - calimari - garlic shrimp - lemongrass chicken"}
{"text":"Okay, so not the best score for this location but there I swear I am trying to be as objective as I possibly can. This is actually my second visit to this Spoon & Fork and with everything being as consistent as it was, it's time for a fair review.   As always, I like to start my reviews with a caption of the decor. Like their other locations, this Spoon & Fork is immaculate and modern. From the floor to the walls to the ceiling, their designer did a fabulous job in making you feel like you've entered a high end establishment that can promise a fun meal with friends or loved ones. A slightly darker/modern tone than most restaurants that I've been to, this location boasts a large and spacious bar/lounge seating area, patio, as well as an inner dining floor. The bar area is akin to what you see at Moxie's and the like, with TVs that broadcasts various sports and high bar tables as well as cushioned booths.   The service is where I docked my first star. While the hostess is usually friendly and all smiles, there was a slight disarray with who should be seated, who was serving who, who was seating who, etc....a discussion that was taking place between the staff members while my group and other hungry guests were waiting. That, however, would not have been worth docking marks as the hostess' smiles and polite manners would have made up for part of the confusion. What was consistent was the lack of service we received in the lounge area. Both visits, my party was seated in the lounge area where we were politely asked about our drink preferences and then...it seemed as if no one was around. It was odd at first because we thought it was just due to a lack of servers. However, we noted today that there were plenty of servers...just not in that area. We saw the dining service team in the main dining area (where there was plenty of space...where some customers were seated...just not our party..?) and they were mainly preoccupied wiping down the lights, windows, or wiping the tables. I applaud the cleanliness and attention to decor details but when we had to pile up our dishes, push all our tea pots to the end of the table, and try our best to wave down service like hungry wolves at every turn...it ruins the mood. We would ask for 2 servings of some items (that came in single pcs) but were served 6 or 12 of those items. It was just frustrating...  The food was overall an 6/10. This is a Japanese/Thai Fusion type of restaurant so there was an assortment of sashimi, curries, and fried rice/noodles. The best dish was their Street Pad Thai which was well seasoned, cooked to perfection, and the right portion. That said...a restaurant that can mess up Miso soup is always a little weird for me. Japanese dishes are not their strong suit at all...the fish wasn't all that fresh, the spicy salmon I had was odd in the sense that it lacked in flavour and texture, the tempura shrimp (which came in 6pcs) were all lumped together and under-seasoned....  Not my favourite spot unfortunately, sorry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for anniversary dinner. The buffet menu is really good. It includes Japanese, Thai and Chinese cuisine and all of them are perfect. It is really tasty, pretty decoration. The price is little bit expensive but it's reasonable. But i came here again on September and the food portion is smaller than it used to be"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and was very impressed. The food was great! The ONLY issue I had at all was with the soy sauce used for the sushi. It seemed like it may have been a brand different than Kikkoman and bottles just refilled. Maybe I'm wrong but it was definitely lighter than I'm used to elsewhere.  The ambiance was great, the service was great, the wait time was less than originally suggested. Had a great, unrushed, time and will absolutely return again."}
{"text":"Food is ok, it was better but is been declining! The portions are not consistent. Sometimes we have to clarify \"bring 4 pieces or serving\" and they bring 1...maybe to save money! It's hard to get water.. Servers are friendly but that's if you can get their attention.  The hostess' are either not trained properly or clueless. They are either staring at a computer screen and ask if you need help 10 mins after standing right in front of them  OR on the phone, talking to who knows, and won't even acknowledge you. They have to learn to multi-task or at least acknowledge and let us know to wait!   The last time we went, they allowed a party (all women, maybe a birthday party) They took soooo much space that the booth side we had, they overtook! Why allow that when something like that should be meant for home..? Made the restaurant look desperate to make money :/  Everytime we go, we are super polite, friendly & use manners but our patience is running thin with this place."}
{"text":"Update: this place has totally redesigned since the last time I've been here. They no longer have booths near the windows, they've been switched out by smaller tables and bar chairs.  It seems as though, they've tried not to make such a significant redesign so it'd be entirely noticeable, however they're putting effort in to continue going forward.  The menus are new and laminated, better than the old ones -- the older ones were kind of beat up, however the food is still the same and tasting as amazing as ever.  4.5/5!"}
{"text":"Had the AYCE option. Resulted in severe food poisoning. I was down for two days with the worst sickness - I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy."}
{"text":"This place sadly has gone DOWN HILL over the years. Asides from the HORRIBLE service the quality of the food has also turned horrible. Disappointed as a regular. Will never recommend this place again. Spoon and fork lost a long time customer with a great word of mouth impact."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their golden curry especially combined with the coconut sticky rice! and really enjoyed the addition of escargot to the menu! Their spicy salmon roll used to be a lot better, however it's still pretty yummy... So long as the crunchy parts are still crunchy rather than soggy.  The coconut shrimp was pretty good too and their wontons are still yummy. Only thing I noticed is that the meat in the wontons seem to have shrunk... That or they're just using bigger wrappers.  Calamari was good. Clearly I have a thing for their appetizers.   I do appreciate the fact that it's one of the places that serve sashimi as part of their lunch menu though that gets a slight bit negated by the fact dessert is an additional cost  (even those typical ice creams all other places seem to include)   Overall, oddly enough I tend to visit here more for their Thai/ Chinese food vs the sushi and sashimi selection  For the money? Go for the lunch as there's nothing extremely special about dinner and it costs more"}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant (Trafalgar location) for years and never had an issue until today. We ordered sashimi and was brought to our table by a server. Moments later our main server Catherine took it back and gave to the table next to us - thinking the other server had made a mistake. A customer from the other table took a few pieces of sashimi. A few minutes passed, Catherine comes back and takes the sashimi back from the other table and brought it back to our table and insisted it was never touched. I know it was touched, I watched the other customer touch the food. She must've seen my facial reaction and had asked if we wanted a new plate of sashimi - we declined as we're not sure what she's going to do with the food after. I've never been so grossed out."}
{"text":"I've visited various sporks (yes, sporks) several times. This particular one, maybe about 3 times. I've done the all you can eat and a la carte. My girlfriend and I always get the golden curry when we do a la carte. They used to do it very well here but I guess things have changed. This particular visit it was very off; however, their portions have gotten MUCH larger. My girlfriend thought it was way too salty and was very disappointed. I thought the chicken had a funny taste. You could taste the strong chicken taste. My girlfriend described it as microwave chicken. Not a good time.  I've always thought their all you can eat wasn't too bad. I don't eat sushi but I do eat everything else on the menu lol. However, other AYCE sushi places trump this place, no doubt. They don't even have cheese wontons!   Our server this time was very attentive and seemed to genuinely be interested in providing a great experience for us. It was a little weird. Lol but thank you.    I will probably return. Maybe not to this particular location but I would still eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"Ok the food better be good, was late 15 mins and they cancelled our reservations, no phone call to advise. Wow! Is Gordon Ramesy cooking at this AYCE ?"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant would have gotten a better rating (maybe 2 stars) if only I HADN'T spoken with the manager at the end of the night!!  Party of 8.  On a Saturday evening. Dining before heading to a movie.  The wait staff were impossible to find when needed.  After asking for water refills that never seemed to materialize one of our group actually ended up having to share/refresh his glass from a friends glass which had not yet been consumed.  Ordered items never arrived (I'm still waiting for my smoked duck salad if any cares to know).  At the end of the meal, while pushed for time to get to our movie it was impossible to get staff to being the check. Needing to split the bill was overly complicated, and to avoid issues, we asked the amount of the total bill, I divided the amount by the number of guests and magically the math worked out to an even $37.00 per person.  (The gratuity of 15% had already been added to the bill which I find absolutely shameful however that wasn't my biggest concern)  When we began to debit our individual amounts to cover the bill the staff member began to take issue with my math.  Apparently HE had neglected to mention that our bill was ACTUALLY $296.18 when I had asked the amount, and now we would be EIGHTEEN CENTS SHORT on our bill.  Due to friends needing to get to their movie one of our party debited for the extra $0.18 to make the staff settle down.  As I paid my portion of the bill I asked the staff if he had a business card for the manager.  As he opened his mouth to answer I noticed his name tag,  which clearly identified the gentleman as the \"manager\".  On discussion it became apparent that he was NOT the shift manager. Or the weekend manager. Or the floor manager......   He was the GENERAL manager.  When apprised of all of the issues his only response was \"so sorry\" as he walked away from the table, debit machine in hand........  While the food was acceptable, I'll never return......."}
{"text":"I want to give 1 1/2 stars but being that i cant, ill give them the 1/2 star. Worst service ever..for $28 you cant even order more than 6 pieces of sashimi at a time which i find really strange being its an ayce japanese place. Service is SLOW.  Ive been to many ayce sushi restaurants and this is by far the most expensive and not even really that good. Would rather pay $23 and go to 168 japanese buffet. They have awesome service and really fresh good food. Only pro about this place is that its nicely decorated. That's it."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for a celebration. The so called lobby area was super crowded. The staff there kept asking us to move out of the way and stand to the side but there was no space!  Made reservations for 8pm, didn't get seated until about 8:20. Ordered our drinks which took almost 10 minutes to come out. Sat there till about 8:50.. and still didn't get food menus. Had to complain to get it.  Food was pretty good though, but for this price tag, you can get something better for less. Dinner was $27.99 and doesn't even include dessert. You can have some ice cream for $4 lol. And that was the cheapest thing on the dessert menu."}
{"text":"There sashimi is not fresh had foodpoisoning. Their skewer was cooked to toast overdone black which is not edible.  The squid was slimy I knew it was strange went home end up taking multiple visit to washroom."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was awesome the service is fast and the place is clean and great atmosphere the have two different menus one all you can eat and one for on the book for lunch and dinner and so fare it's a great location and the have takeout menu and if you pick up the order you will get 10% discount, so you call the go to pick up and if you have a party at home they have a Catering Menu and that's cool and you need to try the chicken and beef Teriyaki and Cashew Nut Chicken it's so good and seaweed salad!!! And it's great for birthday and family fun and party so I highly recommend this restaurant!! :)"}
{"text":"Food is ok there. No wow effects. Service was quick. Nice service. Went out for all you can eat dinner. Not so much variety as expected for dinner time.  Complimentary dessert is only chocolate and vanilla ice cream but it's not featured on the menu. So you have to ask to know if they have it or not included.  Great for groups gathering."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great sushi. Great food. Nice atmosphere.   Service was amazing this visit. The server was very upbeat and happy which is always a plus. She must have checked on us a dozen times which is exactly the right amount for a visit of 90 minutes. The place was busy but she always went around her section and made sure her tables were tended to. Some other servers I. The place may wish to take note :)  The sushi was good as usual. The steak teriyaki was better than other times I have been here.   Food was a bit slow but not too bad considering how packed the place was for lunch. It was reasonable and the server kept coming over to apologize for the delays and I know she was on it because I saw her go back and forth watching her table orders.   This place is a really good place for lunch or dinner. It's a bit upscale for an AYCE sushi place.   Will I be back? Absolutely. Been a regular here for years and plan on continuing that trend."}
{"text":"Clearly I'm missing something? I wouldn't rate this place very high. Went here for the AYCE during lunch and: The sushi menu is limited. The Thai menu is basic standard dishes. The service is super slow. Perhaps on purpose so while you wait you feel full? The \"all black on black\" decor is supposed to make you feel like you're at an upscale restaurant but it really is tacky. Like you're at a club with the lights on and you can see all the stains on the fabrics!  Please save your $18 for lunch elsewhere. So not worth it."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner before we head downtown for the Grease Musical.  The service was surprisingly good since I have been to this location before. The staff are very well attentive but not ver knowledgeable. The food came out super quick. The food was delicious and a fair price for AYCE versus their a la cart menu.  I would definitely come back. They had me on escargot, everything else is a bonus."}
{"text":"Visited this place twice in a roll! Food is very fresh, service is fast and good. Love their Sashimi and Escargot."}
{"text":"First of all I must apologize to Eddy, our patient and attentive server. He had to deal with 13 indecisive people on a busy afternoon but he managed and came through where lesser people would have cracked under the pressure. As soon as we walked in the (I'm assuming) manager took our birthday cake and told us he would happily put it in the fridge for us until we were ready to serve it; that made a great first impression. We sat down and waited for the rest of our table to arrive and we were checked on regularly. I doubt this place is ever quiet; there was a line-up at 1:00pm on the Sunday when we went and it didn't let up. It appears there is good reason for that, there is lots of yummy food for a reasonable price. The sashimi and sushi were very fresh and all the dishes were tasty. I agree there weren't many Thai or Viet options on the menu so as long as you're ok with that you'll have a great time. We had all of our requests taken care of pretty quickly and the service was fast despite how crowded it was. Eddy suggested efficient ways of ordering and did his best to accommodate everyone's demands.The servers even took away a dish that we hadn't ordered without the accusatory looks you get from disapproving servers at some restaurants.  The birthday cake was brought out with plates and a knife at just the right time and we didn't feel rushed at any point in the afternoon. Yes at times we had to catch a server to get service but overall I would recommend this restaurant to the Oakville crowd."}
{"text":"Ambience was very good, the food was also very fresh!  I've been to both this location and the location at Queensway, both have not disappointed.  Reservation is recommended, especially during rush hour times.  We went on a Saturday evening and there was a long line up!  The only thing that was a little disappointing was our server's attitude, wasn't the greatest.  Aside from that, great place, really liked it and will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"I liked the food because of the various options provided for the all you can eat menu while also providing a standard a la carte menu. The typical Japanese rolls and grilled short ribs were as expected and made my friends and I order a few more than we needed. The Various types of pad Thai and fried rice were also quite sumptuous. Although we were surprised at the amount of food per serving as the Japanese selections were in smaller proportion.   The servers were friendly and accommodating and assisted each other so that we didn't have to wait around for our own server to bring us our food. However, we were quite unhappy with the manager with the shaved sides and ponytail that was there today during our visit from 4-6pm. He approached us to give my friend a warning as she had taken a couple pieces of edamame from my other friend  -- however he did this in a condescending manner which is what really bothered us. He proceeded to instruct his servers to watch us like a hawk. When I spoke with him at the end of our meal to inform him of our disappointment in the way in which he spoke with us, my friends and I were appalled at how unapologetic he was. He proceeded to list out what other items he felt my friend ate and spoke about how he hates when people like US do this. Regardless of how I urged him not to paint all of his customers under the same brush, he still insisted that he has a right to do so as he had been wronged many times. Had he discussed the issue with our group in a more sensitive and professional manner, we would have complied and reimbursed them or paid any fees incurred. Instead he has discouraged all 8 of us from ever setting foot in this restaurant or recommending this location to anyone else."}
{"text":"The interior of this place is great, and I thought that the food might match that.  Instead, most of the food was just average. There were a couple of appetizer items that were delicious, but the sushi didn't taste amazing and didn't seem as fresh as other places I have been to. Compared to somewhere like New Generation Sushi in Vaughan, this place doesn't hold up in terms of freshness of the food.  The service was good and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited S&F on our first night in Canada. The food was very delicious and the service was good as well. The maki rolls were not the best that I have tasted, but were good considering it was all you can eat. The dishes that we ordered arrived to our table very quickly. The cocktails that we had were not the best as they tasted more like the juice used to make the drink, but overall, we really enjoyed our experience and it was definitely worth the 30.00."}
{"text":"For $27.99 each, this meal was pricey. But, we came here to celebrate Valentines Day on February 2014, and figured it was worth it to have an AYCE meal to mark the occasion. Upon our arrival at 7:00 PM, this place was packed. However, the server was incredibly friendly, and we were seated right away. The first thing I noticed was the ambience - it has an incredibly romantic setting. Overall, our AYCE experience here was perfect, and the food itself was delicious. We ordered the 3 mango salads, green curry, several rolls, sashimi, bbq ribs, chicken satay with peanut sauce, edamame, and a number of others. The portions aren't too large, so you're able to pace yourself and taste a number of dishes before feeling too full to have anymore. The only downside was that dessert wasn't part of the AYCE menu - if you wanted any ice cream or any type of dessert, it was an extra charge. For the price, I'd expect to have dessert included. However, overall, this was a great food experience and we'd come back!"}
{"text":"I advised people not to go here for a night out for sushi. For 27.99 with no dessert or drinks, what a waste of time!!! I would've planned to go to any other restaurant knowing the cost to eat here. Any other restaurant would have had the same quality of food and service.  However, this place does a solid one star for a nice decor, having a patio and tap on their credit card machine. It has a good higher class feel, but below average selection.  On their menu, all the food that was ordered was average at best. However, 2 thumbs up in the the calamari which would be the best item of their selection.  To conclude, food was average at best while charging premium price. Maybe it's the area, but for the veteran foodies, this does not sit well in our stomachs. Hope prices go down and I'll think of getting the another chances in my good graces."}
{"text":"We've tried this place 5 or 6 times and I try to keep liking it but it's not working.  The service is mediocre to indifferent at best.  Most of the staff lack personality; they rarely talk or look engaged.  The menu lacks descriptions of the items so ordering is somewhat trial and error.  They mess up your order way too often; either bringing you something you didn't order or never bringing it at all.  It's not cheap either which makes it all the more annoying."}
{"text":"Price:  $26.99 for a weekday dinner AYCE  Went here for a friend's birthday. The menu had a wide variety of selection in Japanese and Thai cuisines. Fast, friendly service. And very tasty food.  My only criticism is that the dessert doesn't come with the AYCE price... it's extra! Very disappointed and wouldn't come here again just because of that"}
{"text":"Got Sick  Just like Daniela A, two in our group on 04/12 got really sick.   I know another group of people that went on 04/16 and one of their party got sick.  This kitchen might be dishing out food poisoning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Somewhat pricey. 2 adults and 2 kids under 10 came to $123.52 for the buffet and 4 sodas (which were non refillable).  Layout was different and interesting. Would not visit again."}
{"text":"I went there with my husband and my 14 month old baby this week and we ordered a few things from the AYCE including the chicken fried rice. The fired rice came really fast but there were some bigger pieces of chicken was not cooked through, it was completely RAW in the middle. We told the waiter and he came back said it was not raw, just tendon. At that point they've already took the dish away, but it was a big piece of chicken pink in the middle RAW! No manager came to the table, No further expansions. We got completely turned off and did not want to eat there any more. There charged us FULL PRICE for two person and saying they took off my green tea. What a joke.   If you don't wanna go to a restaurant (Sushi especially) don't care about their food quality, avoid this restaurant at all cost!"}
{"text":"I like it when I see interesting food options open up in Vaughan. There's a real shortage of anything good that isn't your standard Italian restaurant or Viet/Thai place.  Spoon and Fork helps fill that void -- just a bit.  Overall, the quality of the Japanese items is quite good for AYCE -- maki rolls aren't filled with ridiculous amounts of rice, ingredients are fresh, etc. Surprisingly, the stir fried items (from the Thai selection) are also satisfying. I had the Bangkok street-style pad thai which was better than the pad thai offered at most places, and the pad sew was excellent as well. I enjoyed both of them, but then tried some of their other stir fried items (like side dishes with veggies and stuff) and they all tasted the same. A bit uninspired there.  Service is pretty good. Staff are courteous. There is one fellow in particular who was rather knowledgeable (not sure about the other staff) -- knew the ingredients for all of the rolls off the top of his head, even knew the steeping times for different teas. Impressive. Decor is also very modern and classy, though I'm not sure how I feel about them lining the tables with a piece of paper over the tablecloth (so that they don't have to change the tablecloths as often) -- this is like the classier version of the white plastic tabletop liners used at those ghetto Chinese restaurants).   They weren't very busy the night I went, yet they kept sending us things we didn't order, and a number of dishes we did order never showed up. -1 star for that. Also, the prices here (for the dinner buffet) aren't exactly competitive. They are on the higher side, and the fact that desserts aren't included in the price makes this poor value. -1 star.  Overall, decent choice if I'm in the area and looking for something interesting. But on most days I think I'd still venture over to Richmond Hill for better value."}
{"text":"Spoon & Fork (an interesting name for a Japanese place!) is located in the giant, Colosuss area of Vaughan. Sleek and modern on the outside, and delivers the same on the inside, Spoon & Fork is a decor treat for your eyes! It's a bit upscale, which I wasn't expecting, so I totally felt under dressed in my sparkly vans and hello kitty sweater lol.  The service leaves something to be desired. The wait staff were friendly enough, but in the entire time our party of 7 was there (approx 1.5-2 hrs) our water glasses were not filled. Not ONCE. We were not checked in on other than when they had to take our orders, give us food (note, we opted for a la carte and not AYCE,) or take our plates away. It was also not that busy (came in at 5:30 on a Friday night.)  Everyone who ordered something that had an OPTION to come with rice, was given rice (without being asked) and then charged an extra $2 on top of what their entree price was.   Items are generally on the pricier side.  The food was alright, but nothing that I sampled (chicken teriyaki, mango chicken, shrimp spring rolls, a few other miscellany items) were a standout for me. I also had the deep fried cheesecake, which could have been better if it wasn't still partially frozen on the inside when I received it.  Overall, I don't think I'd personally choose to frequent this establishment, especially since there are many other alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"This place is really something special - very fresh, good quality food and beautiful atmosphere!  It's really a must-try if you like Thai and Japanese food - the calamari is seriously the best I ever had!  We don't go too often as it can get pricy, especially if you order drinks."}
{"text":"Having been to every single Spoon & Fork locations numerous times, this location is by far the most disappointing in terms of food quality, portion size, and service.  First off, let me start off by the take out service. One of the best deals you can find at Spoon & Fork is their catering menu. You can get a $20 or $30 platter and it offers incredible value. I have ordered this platter at 3 different locations so far and it has been solid.   However, at this location, they really skimp out on the sashimi portion. They cut the pieces of fish about half the size from the other locations. I decided to give them another chance and order the $30 (T14) platter. Since we were in a rush, we did not check the platter thoroughly. Instead of 2 containers that the T14 offers, they only gave us 1 container! So we were missing about 30 pieces.   Two weeks ago, I also dined for a friend's birthday dinner. After ordering about 10 items, the waiter rudely cut me off and said \"Let's go with these for now\". The next time we ordered, he gave us the line of \"If you don't finish your food, we will charge you for extra\". The whole table  found this statement odd, as every single plate at our table was completely devoured without a trace of food left. Plus we were only ordering our 2nd round and were ordering sensible quantities of food.  The overall impression I got from this location is they don't want you order a lot of food and they skimp out on the take out platters. The typical Asian restaurant that lowers the quality to boost profit.   I have never had any issues at JJ at Mississauga, Spoon & Fork at Vaughan, Oakville. Needless to say, I will never go back to this location again.  Service - 5/10 Food - 3/10 Quality - 3/10"}
{"text":"This place doesn't take reservations - however it's pretty huge and we were seated promptly upon arrival for a party of 4 on a Saturday evening.   Parking lot is huge and easy to find a spot.  They have daily drink specials - and lucky for us it was prosecco that night which we enjoyed! We elected to go for the all you can eat menu because the sushi alone made it worth it!  The menu offered a combination of salads, sushi, appetizers, soups, warm foods such as chicken or beef dishes and noodles or rice. The nice part about it was they let you order the quantity you desire ( i.e. 2 pieces of each role) so you can try different things without getting too full.   Service was diligent and we enjoyed our experience here. Food was great and we would definitely come back again! We really had a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"First impressions - very classy looking place with the decore and the dimmed lighting.  The food was just as good as the York Mills location but had much fewer options to choose from. For example, BBQ eel in the sashimi section is missing and the Italian pasta are not available at all in this location. Not too sure if this menu is standard in all locations, because its quite possible the menu has changed since my last visit to the York Mills location.  $16.99 per person for the lunch AYCE is still a great value because they do offer salmon sashimi.  Good food, excellent service, affordable price."}
{"text":"Went there for birthday dinner.  It was six adults and two young children (6 and 2).  The food as always was great and they were very accommodating.  There was enough on the menu to suit everyone's palate and the children were happy.  This was my fifth visit here and I have always had a pleasant experience.  One person in our party said she did not like Chinese food too much however she had a different feeling at the end of the meal and liked the different types of Asian cuisine offered.  Great night out and nice decor."}
{"text":"I went there last week with my colleagues. The food is average. but the customer service was terrible.  I ordered my food 2x times and it never came."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here, recently I started to see the avocado looks like prepared long time ago with color change. Scallops not available, pink chicken in their dishes, signs of abdominal troubles after I eat there. Anyway not that happy with the money spent in return to the quality. For the people never been there, it is all what you can but A-la-Carte, not an open buffet."}
{"text":"all u can eat was a bit pricey (and I've had better) but we went with a group, they were busy & the food was still out quickly. service was good as well.   most of the items our table ordered to share & they were decent. again, we've done ayce sushi before elsewhere & I loved every bite of it but not here - but it wasn't horrible either, just decent (I would prefer at least 80% of it to be good or great for this price obviously!)  coconut shrimp -order it. sauce is good too!  fried cheesecake - not the best bc it's more of a tempura batter instead of the usual dough u would find with these kind of items. if they change the batter, it would be 100% delish! :-)  green tea ice cream - one of the best ive had in canada."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi place I've been to, and I think the only one in Etobicoke. For $28 per person, they have a really extensive sushi menu with extra Japanese and Thai dishes to add some extra deliciousness. It's obviously on the pricey side for AYCE, but the quality of food and variety of the menu justify the price.  Service was friendly and, despite the restaurant being full, extremely quick too.  The only (figurative) beef I have is that they charged extra for green tea, where most (cheaper) AYCE places include that in the price... And the green tea was kind of weird.  Overall, great experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Today (17-JUN-2012) we wanted to try this place as a friend recommended it to me. We got there at 11:10am and they didn't open until 11:30am. Their doors were open and we asked if we could just sit down and wait but the hostess stated we couldn't and had to come back later. No big deal. They are setting up, no problem.   So we come back at 12:10pm after doing some shopping and then she would not seat us as they were full for all their walk in customers as they are very busy all the time. We got very annoyed at this and stated to her that we were there at 11:10am. Then she stated we just have to wait and that there MAY be another table available later. WHY, since she knows they get busy, did she not make a table available for us and tell us to be there at 11:30am or 11:45am or etc? A good hostess would have. And when stated we were there at 11:10am she was very rude and had the attitude of \"well too damn bad\" (she didn't actually say that but you tell).  This is one of the worst services I have ever had a restaurant by a hostess and I will never go back."}
{"text":"I definitely give it 5 stars for environment. It has a club like environment, so I could imagine coming here for dinner with a date or friends.   The food was 4 stars. A bit pricey but the quality of the Pad Thai and Fried Rice was above average.   I would recommend coming here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My friends and I love Spoon and Fork as an AYCE restaurant.  The service has been very good during the several times I have been there.  The food has come out fresh, and although there aren't as many items on the menu as other AYCE restaurants, it's enough to fill you up.   The atmosphere is very modern-looking as well, which is probably why the price for dinner is $27.99 on a weekend.  The restaurant has a dining area and a lounge area with a bar.  When I'm at the restaurant, I feel that the pace is a lot slower, and nobody seems to be rushed, which is great.  Some of the food highlights were the coconut shrimp, tiger shrimp curry with coconut steamed rice, a variety of sashimi options, and the dynamite roll.  I would definitely come back here again.  It's great for special occasions.  The only issue I have with the restaurant is the price.  With taxes and tip, the price is ~$35 per person.  The food is great, but sometimes I question whether the food quality is worth that much (which is why I usually go on special occasions)."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. When you walk in there is no hostess at the front and when they are there they ignore you. We waited 10 min at the front just to put our name on the list and it wasn't even busy. When we sat down many items from the list were crossed off. Compared to other ayce joints this one's menu is extremely limited. Save your money and go to Sake Sushi."}
{"text":"Can't believe it's been about 2 years since I've went to Spoon and Fork in Vaughan! I was expecting 5/5 stars like the previous time but was left disappointed.  First off...$27.99 for ayce sushi is expensive! There are way better ayce sushi restaurants that are a bit cheaper. For some reason we got full pretty quick so we definitely did not eat our worth of $27.99 plus tip.  Service wasn't that great that night. A couple who sat down after us got served before us and that's a no no in my books. The order of foods didn't come in the proper order. We were given our sushi rolls before our appetizers.  The maki rolls weren't that great and would be classified as average. Nothing I ate that night blew my mind according to my review from 2 years ago.  I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to several Spoon & Forks, as well as AYCES restaurants, and I keep coming back to this one. I've been here three times now and after each visit I am immediately craving it again!  I highly recommend the lunch as it is much less busy and more affordable.   Service has always been prompt and friendly. There are no ipads to order but your server is always close to take another round.   Here's my typical ordering plan when out with my boyfriend.  First Round: Spring Rolls- typical rolls. Nothing really special but my boyfriend likes them so we get 'em! Deep Fried Wonton- I'm a sucker for any place where they serve deep fried wonton. This is always a must have.  Avocado Rolls- simple and perfect.  One other maki roll- we usually change it up and get something fun like tempura roll or crazy roll. (I wish they gave descriptions of their maki rolls because I'm always guessing to remember which one I enjoyed last time) Peanut Sauce Chicken- THIS! This is my favourite thing on the whole menu. I crave this the second I've finished it. It's a rich and spicy dish best eaten with some coconut rice! Teriyaki Beef- Just found this tasty treasure on our last visit. Comes with sesame sauce on the side for dipping. Major win!  Second Round: (by this point we're usually both full but want to make the most of our trip) Tempura- This one was a bit of a mess last time. The tempura was a bit pasty and not great. Calamari- Yum Yum! This one might be heading to a first round pick! Avocado Rolls- Second helping on my most favourite maki!  We don't order the sashimi. I've heard it is good, we're just not big into sashimi.   The thing I love the most about AYCES is the small portions. I get full pretty quickly but I always want to try a little bit of everything. Spoon and Fork give nice size portions so you're not eating to just eat (which can happen at some all you can eat places and really leaves a less satisfying feeling). I get to try the items I want and really enjoy the dining experience. Also, the interior is gorgeous!  If you're out this way for a movie, or some shopping (Winners is right across the parking lot!!), definitely stop in!  -Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the people who had positive reviews about this place work there or did i go on an off day. I was there when dinner first opened so possibly i was eating yesterday nights leftovers. I have eaten there before as well as the etobicoke location and loved it. The food was great and the service as well. Today the fish tasted dry and old, the sushi rice was mushy, and the list goes on and on. I'm admittedly a bit of a food snob, but even my wife hated it (she also loved it before). If i was the owner id fire everyone and start all over. The chefs cant cook, the servers have a bad attitude and the owners probably don't care about this place anymore. I wouldn't eat here for free so you can imagine how i felt after paying the bill. Too many other good ayce choices to waste my time and money on them ever again."}
{"text":"Went to the Vaughan location on Sunday night for the first time. Overall it was really good. I love the portion sizes I'm a big eater and my date and myself had plenty to eat with around 6 to 8 selections."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I went there for my mom's birthday yesterday and I still didn't get my miso soup, this is after ordering it 3 times.  If they are all out it would be nice if they came and told us.  The service was extremely slow, waitress did not serve us and they had the nerve to charge us tip.  TIP - TO INSURE PROMPTNESS,  there was no promptness in this restaurant or service for that matter.  To those of you who are interested in attending this restaurant.  Believe me there are way better Japanese thai restaurants out there.  Another piece that irked me was the fact that the manager brought us the bill and never bothered to ask if everything was ok.  If you plan on charging a service fee please ask the customers how was the service or if there was any for that matter."}
{"text":"I had  golden curry for lunch. Great service, good food, nice presentation. First time in this restaurant, very open and nice, i ll come back many more times for sure"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place to eat but now the service is at a snails pace and I find they push the bill on you before you are finished. I shouldn't be going across the parking lot to Tim's to pick up a donut and sandwich to feel full.   The last time I went they forgot about my friend and I TWICE, we never received our drinks from the get go (they weren't on the bill either, so I think they were never marked down) and food would be luke warm by the time we go it (cold tempura is depressing). I gave up and accepted when they asked if I was ready for my bill.  Used to eat here a lot, but now I don't think I'll be coming back. Service has gotten worse and worse each time I go. Shame, food is still great."}
{"text":"The dining area in the Vaughn location is nicer but the chef at the Etobicoke location is far better.  Try the spicy Thai noodles!"}
{"text":"Been there a bunch of times.  Every time I was there I did the all you can eat.  I have also done take out a few times.  And was always pleased.  Locale: the place has a very modern look and a really nice patio that they open during the summer.    Service: apart from one time where the service was slightly slower when we were seated outside, the service is really good.    Food: the sushi is really good, naigiri is fresh and pieces are large.  The Thai food is pretty good, the BBQ steak are large and delicious.   Cost: lunch is worth the price, the dinner is a bit expensive but you do get a few things which are not available during lunch.  (The special cooked beef tikiki is def something I did not try in other places).  Takeout is decently priced (10% off) compared to the menu.     Really good: peanut sauce chicken.  The place is good for both large and small groups.  Note that during the weekend you will likely need reservations."}
{"text":"It's very very pricey, but everything is fresh and delicious. I have to admit, I was NOT a fan of this place when I first started going, but they've been getting better and better...and now to the point that they've earned a 5 star rating from me. I had NO complaints about anything I ordered. Even the sushi was quite fantastic."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for my bday a couple weeks ago. The decor and ambience was nice and it was bustling with people on a Saturday night.  The service was great! It seemed like only a few minutes after we finished placing the order, it was on the table. Time and time again. Quite fast!  The food was very tasty. It was fresh and hot (when it was supposed to be). It's pricey for sure, but with sushi, you get what you pay for. There was a lot of dishes to choose from, if we hadn't filled up on maki and appetizers, we would've tried more! I guess that warrants another visit in the future.  The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars, was due to the price. 25 bucks for all you can eat would've garunteed 5 out of 5. Regardless, it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"This is the third and last time we will go to Spoon and Fork.  Angry that they wouldn't give us a booth b/c we were only a party of 2; however, there were three open booths, and three booths sat with other parties of two.  Service is slow.  Food is way overpriced for AYCE sushi.  The \"hot\" food is pre-prepared and comes out room temperature at best.  Sashimi is not properly cut.  No dessert included (for $28 per person!).  Our server merely took our order and delivered our food, there was little to no \"service\".  Not keen to come back and check on you, offer suggestions, provide descriptions, or anticipate your next need.  (If you see that my glass is empty, why do I have to ask for more water?)  It stinks going out to eat, and then getting the bill and thinking, \"Wow, what a waste!\"."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was severely disappointed. We ordered from the all you can eat menu and from start to finish the meal was just not very good. The sushi was mediocre,  the thai dumplings were almost inedible,  the wok dishes all seemed to be missing something. They couldn't even make a good mango salad. There is more to complain about but you get the picture."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the S&F on Tuesday night with 6 guests. We all chose to have the AYCE Japanese and Thai menu. We ordered just about every appetizer and many main courses. Everything was served hot and freshly cooked. Our faves were: Coconut shrimp Tempura shrimp Crab fried rice Golden chicken curry Tempura veggies Wings Sushi Sashimi  The dessert is not included, but we were too full anyway! The Hostess was somewhat rude (maybe too young), but the server and her helpers were awesome. Lots of suggestions on what to order as well as appropriate sized plates for sharing.  Dinner for 7 including drinks, tax and tip was $350.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent all-you-can-eat... their crowd management is terrible, there was roughly 30 people standing in a very small lobby area. They need to ditch the booth near the door, and create a sitting area. I wanted to get a drink while we waited, but was difficult to make your way to it. Very poorly thought out. Nice decor though...  Food was decent...the mini sushi pizza's were very good, although i didnt like the pad thai, my dinner date loved it. Sushi pieces were generous in size. Very quick from time ordered to brought to the table, however the rolls were poorly rolled.  Was OK, not sure if I would return. Definitely have a reservation if you go."}
{"text":"Was seated at a table in the bar area with plentiful TV screens to watch the game, and the decor was gorgeous. Our server Ali was fantastic. He was outgoing, sociable, and provided an exceptional experience. The food was delicious and arrived quickly, with plates cleared at a fast pace also. Prompt refills and excellent service. Would come back!"}
{"text":"This place can appear disorganize when seated to capacity, but ALL your food will come eventually. the Fried Rice dishes are must-tries. If you plan to go there after 6:30 pm on a holiday or weekend evening, call ahead and reserve a table, or you will be there waiting long."}
{"text":"This is by far my boyfriend's favorite AYCE place, it never seems to disappoint.   Since we go to a lot of AYCE japanese sushi places, consuming all that raw fish can get a tad boring. I love that Spoon & Fork is also a thai restaurant because they have so many amazing options.   My top favorite food items were: - Mango salad - Coconut shrimp - Duck salad - Coconut soup  - Chicken satay - Beef short ribs  We typically go to the Queensway location, but we didn't make any reservation and we decided to spontaneously eat here on a Sunday around 6pm. From our previous experience, the Queensway location is always packed and full, so we decided to come to the Oakville location. The restaurant was very nicely decorated with plenty of thai decorations (my fav...all the buddha's).  Our server was great. She came frequently and ensured that all our items came in a timely manner.   We were originally going to go to Spoonful in Brampton ($32.99) but we knew that Spoon & Fork would be a great option that wouldn't disappoint for $28.99!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like over priced high sodium food and bad service, this is the place for you.    Came here on a Sunday night for a birthday dinner with 15 people - not by choice.  Didn't realize it was all-you-can-eat at first.  Here are the highlights: - really bad service.   The server kept messing up the orders, didn't really seem to care and just kept dropping the dishes in one spot for us to decide who ordered what.  You might as well make it a self serve buffet if you don't want to hire enough staff. - All of the food was really gross.  Too salty,  lacked flavor,  cold and really not good. - Overpriced.   For two people our bill came to $76 (not including tip).  All we had were two buffet plates and 2 bottles of water.  The only positive thing I can say is the decor is beautiful.  Very well designed restaurant, but looks are surely deceiving.   Will never be returning here again."}
{"text":"So this was my first time coming here and I must say that the decor was very nice and modern.   The food was just ok at best.  Service was really questionable.  We had a servicer that couldn't control his attitude when serving us.  He was extremely annoyed with us and kepted on repeating \"ANYTING ELSE?\" so loud.  The food runners there expect you to clear your own table and put your own food down. With that being said, I would probably come back when I'm really desperate. I will also pray that we don't get the same server but I'll bring my eye plugs just in case."}
{"text":"A chic, mod, posh looking place for AYCE? Can this be true?   Came with a group of 10. Service could've been better as we were ignored a few times but it wasn't too bad overall.   THe food was delicious  and we ordered so much stuff.... from thai to jap dishes. We definitely can't wait to be back soon. A bit disappointed no desserts with the AYCE but i guess it's not biggie.   Eat till you drop :) Be sure to reserve a table to avoid any disappointments. I feel weekends here are crazy...."}
{"text":"If you are coming for only sushi  I would not recommend this place at all...it tasted old and fish seemed to be precut/minced...the only reason for the 2 star was there creme burlee was OK.  Easily in the bottom 5 of the sushi places I have been to"}
{"text":"Had a large mixture of sushi and Thai food.  Each dish was hit and miss.  Sushi was not bad but the sauce on many of the Thai dishes was too thick."}
{"text":"What a joke. Decor is chic and trendy, but that's about all there is. Sushi was laughable. Huge portions of rice and thin slices of fish. They call their all-you-can-eat a \"tasting menu\". If that makes you feel fancier good for you. The average ayce sushi place is miles better if not as pretty. Service was snobby and disinterested. Felt ill almost immediately after finishing my meal. Suffice it to say I spent an extended time in the restroom. Overall, it's style over substance. If you want it to look like you're eating in a fine establishment, but don't care that the quality is actually garbage, gon here."}
{"text":"Amazing decor and good food to come with it! I was very bummed out that they didn't take reservations on the weekends, because it was quite crazy. The hostess recommended that the best time to come on a weekend was around 6-6:30.   It is an All you can eat restaurant so I wouldn't expect the best service, especially on weekends. I still enjoyed the food, it came out just right, and I really enjoyed the maki rolls. Also, the padthai was great, and the green curry was perfect, both sweet and spicy with the coconut rice.   Over all, the food was delicious and fresh. I definitely felt that this restaurant has improved since the last time I dined there, which was about a year ago. Even though it was pricy, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice (for birthday parties) and didn't enjoy each visit. Very expensive here for AYCE sushi. They make you pay for tea (which is normally free at other establishments). Also the customer service has always been lacking. I had a very rude server both times I came. Food quality is ok and selection is good - but I can't get myself to go back here."}
{"text":"-- It not have a star at all---  My husband and I have visited in Jan. 2012. It was a cold Friday night and the place looked nice enough from outside to merit a visit. We should have turned away and left once the \"sitting hostess\" was rude to us, but we've decided to press on in hopes to have a better experience inside. Why? you ask - well, we wanted to give the place the benefit of the doubt. Our mistake - we should have left.   We are both big sushi lovers, but the price of $27.99 for rather small selection of sushi supplemented by some Thai items, in a place that we've never visited before has turned us off.   So we've decided to try their a-la-carte Thai dishes instead. The Tom Yom soup was Ok. The spring rolls that are supposed to be served hot were cold as stones and just as hard to chew. But the worse was yet to come: the main course. I've ordered the Panang Beef (which is very good in places like the Salad King) and asked the waiter if the sauce for the dish was sweet. I was assured that its not. My husband has ordered the Basil Beef.   What I've received was disgusting. Pieces of unidentifiable meat were literally floating in a dish full with thick, smelly sauce, so sweet that I had to drink two cups of water just to flush down the sugars it contained. There was nothing else in the dish - no rice, vegetables, nothing else. Just the floating pieces in a brown liquid. My husband's dish was no better: charred beef with no notice of basil.   When I finally managed to flag down the waiter who was loudly flirting with the table next to us, and asked for an explanation, he could offer non. What I should have done was request a \"chef\" or whoever has prepared that excrement in a bowl to come forth and demonstrate eating it. Shame on them.   Needless to say, we won't be returning to this place and will ensure that our friends and family avoid it like a plague."}
{"text":"Worse place ever!   waited 2 hours for horrible service!  and food sucked!"}
{"text":"When my parents were here to visit me from Germany, I took them here. It was really good food with appropriate portion. They really put hard work on the presentation of food. Had really nice time. It's better to book a room table because this place is always crowded. And it is not pleasant to wait outside."}
{"text":"Food is great I would recommend the Japanese fried rice and the crispy beef from the appetizer section. It is pretty expensive so be sure to come with a large appetite. The staff is usually friendly and there are daily drink specials."}
{"text":"Wow, simply put.   The uber modern decor and almost lounge like atmosphere were a nice surrounding for the meal that was going to follow.   The service was fast, attentive and friendly. Everything we ordered came out fast and fresh. We were even given clean plates after a bit.   Even the look of the plated food was somewhat stylish.   The first thing out was soup, the hot and sour soup was the best I've had in some time and  definitely the best in the area that I've had. Next was some sushi and dumplings and spring rolls and very flavorful. The portions weren't too much as to get full quickly. We were able to try a number of things and we enjoyed every bite.   The mix Japanese and Thai menu works perfectly for us since my wife doesn't like fish and I love sushi. The only problem is, I love Thai food as well, and there isn't a bad item on the menu.   As I said, the soup was the best I've had in some time. The sushi was a very good portion, fresh and served quickly. The pineapple rice was a nice subtle sweetness. The pieces of chicken and beef used in the various other dishes were nice and tender. The sauces for various items were bee flavorful as well and complimented everything nicely rather than over powering the flavors in the food.   Bottom line with a price tag of $27.99, it was well spent when you consider a regular AYCE sushi shop charges around $22. There will most definitely be a return trip to Spoon & Fork. I'm already excited for that trip!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome. Food choice is not that bad just think of having sushi ayce and they have sashimi"}
{"text":"worst restaurant I have ever been. The service is slow, bad attitude of the staff. I would not go there even if they gave me the money."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to S&F and they really dropped the ball this time. Came for our annual company dinner and the servers kept on dropping stuff on us - iPads, some plates..one time they even spilled sauce all over us and it landed it on my shoes. The only thing they didn't drop is the kitchen sink. Food was okay, but service was so bad this time. Maybe it's a bad weekend. Hope they get better"}
{"text":"I have tried both the Queensway Location and the Woodbridge one.  Both great!!!  For the price you pay, I would totally recommend you do \"All you Can Eat\" for either Lunch or Dinner.  Amazing selection, delicious food!  Definitely recommend it to all!  Not a fan of sushi here so I order all the meat and veggie dishes and all have been delicious ESPECIALLY the Chicken Pad Sew, the Beef and Broccoli MELTS in your mouth, the Shrimp Japanese Rice, the Chinese Broccoli (perfectly cooked), the Salmon/Chicken and Beef Teryaki is PERFECTION and the Chicken Satay and the peanut sauce to dip it in is Yum too!    The place itself is beautifully set up too and has a really nice ambiance to it.  Great for dates or a friend or few."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Been to both locations: Queensway and the one in Woodbridge.  Both really great food but better service at the Queensway location.  All you can Eat definitely worth it.  My favourite dishes:  EVERYTHING except for the soups (excluding the Miso soup which is good, salads and sushi (not a big fan of sushi unless its at Blowfish).   Chicken Pad-sew is my favourite so I get 2 orders each time; Chinese broccoli, beef dishes (ALL ARE AMAZING and the BEEF melts in your mouth). YUM"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Favourite Thai food. Love the Queensway establishment if still there. Price is reasonable too."}
{"text":"The duck bacon, decor, and service are what saves this place.   Take away the duck bacon salad and the food rating plummets.   As with most all you can eat places, food quality tends to suffer. I could tell that I was getting second rate sushi, second rate noodles, and second rate dessert (despite the dessert menu being an additional cost ala carte).  I don't have much to say about this place other than that because the food was so blah.  Our total bill for 5 people was $166 (this includes a separate $12 dessert added into the bill).  Not worth it for the food but the ambiance was definitely a huge plus.  Will likely not be back. There are better options for special occasions."}
{"text":"I dined here last week with my colleagues for the all you can eat. It was pretty good, we had the garlic beef, pepper beef, peanut chicken, beef & broccoli, misu soup, sushi, and pad thai. Everything was tasty, except the pad thai was a bit too sweet.The sushi was very fresh and there was a good ratio of rice on the seaweed. The service was also great, our food came out quickly and fresh and our extra plates were always removed. Great for large parties or couples."}
{"text":"All you can eat is what I would always go for! Sushi and sashimi are the pick of the menu! Didn't like the teriyaki much!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a monday -- pretty busy too!  Definitely order for apps: mango salad, miso soup, fried calamari (AMAZING), spring rolls Do not order: fried wontons (they're just deep-fried wonton wraps with nothing in it), seaweed salad (old and wrinkly)  Sashimi is great! Hand rolls are a definite NONO. Literally packed with rice and ONE little tiny fish or whatever. Better just stick with maki rolls or sashimi.  CONS?! They don't include DESSERT. Wtf!!!!!! That's the best part about all-you-can-eat... and they don't even have that. You have to pay extra  =\ not cool.   I'd go back just for the calamari."}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant a couple of years ago and remembered it to be pretty good.    My visit a week ago was very disappointing.  Overpriced for the all you can eat considering g the quality of the food.  KB Sushi down the street is the same price and much much better.   The spring rolls were alarmingly bad.  They tasted like they were from the Asian party pack from the freezer section at Costco.  The rest of the items were mediocre at best.  Only item I enjoyed were the green dragon rolls but that's about it.   Will definitely not be retuning here, even if the price was cut in half."}
{"text":"This place has been open in my neighbourhood for years but I only got the chance to visit last week. I went for dinner on Thursday evening.  I have to say that I LOVED the food. The portions are very small but that is a great thing because you can try different things. I will definitely be going back for the AYCE."}
{"text":"My Friend extremely recommended this place for the best sushi in TO.  Went there with huge expectations and generally speaking it was an-OK, just a good place in the middle of my Sushi ranks, some rolls were good, some were weird, the fish wasn't crazy fresh and soft but was OK. Comparing to other Sushi restaurants in the area this one is on the pretty pricey.  I would recommend this place at least once because it is clearly a thing of personal taste with this place."}
{"text":"We go through these strange cravings for AYCE sushi and last night we settled on Spoon and Fork. Having been there before, we knew to expect a consistent and average level of food and service.  Last night though, we were actually very impressed. The service was prompt and pleasant. We didn't feel rushed or pressured into anything, unlike past visits and other AYCE sushi places.  The food was the freshest we've experienced so far. Food came out either hot and steaming or perfectly chilled. Notable items were the basil chicken fried rice and the hand rolls, both of which are my personal favourites.  The fried rice was piping hot and delicious. A tad greasier than I would have liked, but that may just be a preference thing. The hand rolls were so fresh that the seaweed was still crispy, the mark of a just made roll.   We will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with Spoon & Fork. Came here on Thursday night and it was packed (make a reservation, even mid week!)  They have a large menu with mainly Thai and Japanese food. Usually this spells trouble, but the food was all executed perfectly here.   I tried a Rainbow roll ($12) and a Hawaii roll (mango & crab - $6). Fish was exceptionally fresh - I was not expecting the melt-in-your-mouth type freshness of fish from a place like this, but it truly was really well done.   Moro mu (my DC) had a chicken terriyaki meal ($15) and a dish of stir-fried rice, which were both well done and nicely presented.  The service here was fantastic, we had a funny guy who cracked jokes and was very attentive.  You can skip the A-La-Carte menu and do an all-you-can-eat type ordering system off the menu for $26.99, which is absolutely ridiculously cheap! You can order a large variety of fancy rolls, sashimi, Japanese and Thai appetizers, curries, terriyaki dishes and everything else. No wonder people are lining up out the door, it's a bargain.  Decor is fresh and modern. The booth seating along the upper level is nice."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! Hosts/Servers at this place are unbelievably rude! Tried to get a reservation for a Saturday dinner at 8:30pm for 8 people but the hostess on the phone said that its later in the evening we don't need to make a reservation since there will be tables available. We get there at 8pm and the place is full so we asked if we could get a table for 8 and rude hostess gives us a racist attitude and tells us that she will take my name down in the wait list but tells me that they will probably not accommodate us because they are fully booked. We waited 1.5 hours for nothing even after checking with them numerous times, my parents were so pissed we walked out of there. If they were fully booked, they should have told me over the phone when I tried to make a reservation not when our entire family gets to the place expecting to eat there only to walk out starving and find another place late at night to get dinner. Trust me, this place is so expensive you'd expect better service from these people, unfortunately that's the sad part. It's not worth your money go someplace else where they will treat you with respect than rip you off! I have been to the Vaughan and Mississauga locations and service there is better compared to this snotty place. We will never set foot at this place again and I will make sure people we know are informed about their terrible service!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family for AYCE dinner.   The decor is lovely and the ambience is nice as well especially for AYCE. It reminds me of Spring Rolls but I def can say the AYCE here was better taste wise but does fall a bit short of Spring Rolls on presentation.  As an AYCE fan; and a sushi lover I must say that the menu doesnt have that much sushi options but this place is great for families as it has an extensive Thai menu as well so it can cater to many taste buds. Along with the restaurant itself; it fairs well for family outings.   The food is definitely good esp for AYCE. I wasn't disappointed in the slightest but I can't say I was blown out of the water. Its a good place and i'll be back but if I had to choose my favourite thai place; this place wouldn't be in my mind and same goes for sushi. Overall its good and def a place I wouldn't turn down."}
{"text":"Went and enjoyed. Food was good quality and had the all you can eat. Came in small portions, so ordered a number of them at once.   Only thing was on a Friday night they stopped making food and serving alcohol early (1030-11) and little fruit flies started showing up. Also a bit expensive considering the above."}
{"text":"3.5  OK but nothing to commend much neither. Sushis are too bland. Rolls are much better elsewhere. Noddles and especially Bangkok pad thai and curry items are good. Katsus can be forgotten, as salads.   Service is a hit and miss, depending on the hour and the waiter you get (I got a good one, so was good).  Price is descent, not much a problem. You'll leave full for sure and for that price, that is a plus."}
{"text":"It used to be such a good place for all you can eat. Today we went it wasn't that good. The food wasn't amazing. They no longer have very many options for desserts. The waiter had forgotten our order like 3 times. No longer my fave"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food ... we go there every week ... i have a 5 years old son who doesnt eat anything from here but we still get charged ... other than that everything is awesome"}
{"text":"Had a Birthday dinner party here, Fantastic food but service needs improvement. Had to speak with waiter supervisor about  our aloof waiter.Took 20 minutes to get a drink...the excuse that its busy doesnt wash well. The Birthday girl ordered a mango dacquiri,  it arrived 20 minutes later, and wasnt a mango dacquiri?? The waiters need to slow down and serve their customers not just throw food on the table and try to get away before the customer can order more. As I said, fantastic food $24.99 for all you can eat."}
{"text":"Although this place is very well decorated and has a classy ambience, the food they serve here is not all that special, some dishes were great some were meh. However, I do feel like its definitely a great place to host special group gatherings and birthdays, as they have an all you can eat option with a variety of selections and their is plentiful space and servers to keep up.  Service and Environment The one thing I don't like about this place is that you have to order everything you want by mouth, when most all you can eat sushi places give you an order check list or an iPad. The service here is a hit or miss depending on the servers. On my last visit, our server wasn't all that friendly and didn't seem to care about our table too much. In terms of pace, service here is pretty quick, our food items usually come out within 5-10 minutes of ordering.  Food Appetizers Their takoyaki, lemongrass soup, calamari, California salad are some of my favourites!  Sushi Rolls & Sashimi Their maki rolls are pretty good; not the best but definitely on par or higher with some other popular all you can eat sushi restaurants in the area.  Noodles and Rice My favourite noodle dish is definitely their Bangkok Chicken Pad Thai! Some of their other noodles and rice dishes are standard.   The Rest Teriyaki dishes are decent. Their curries with coconut rice are really good, so be sure to give that a try. Everything else was okay and nothing memorable.   Unfortunately, desserts are not included in the all you can eat price (not even ice cream!). So if you want to order dessert you would have to pay for it separately."}
{"text":"Food quality is good, everyone in my party enjoyed their food.  Service is a bit hit or miss.  When you order the buffet, it does take a bit of time (longer than it should) for the food to get to you.  And it takes a long time for them to take your next order.  They could be understaffed, or the wait staff just ineffcient, not entirely sure.   But the interior decor is nice, modern and elegant.  A bit expensive, on par with Mandarin buffet.    I would recommend it for big groups, parties, family get-togethers, couples, etc."}
{"text":"Located on the Queensway, a 20 minute bus ride from Keele Station on the 80 bus--according to Google it should have taken 35 minutes but it was much quicker (no traffic and the driver did not stop at all stops).  Spoon and Fork was situated right next to Mandarin and very close to a Japanese AYCE.    Dinner event was an intimate dinner with friends who were leaving Canada for good at the end of the month--a solemn event but nice and cozy.  The menu wasn't crazy extensive yet there were more than enough choices.  $30 allowed you access to the appetizers, sushi, sashimi, handrolls, grilled foods, foods from the wok, noodles, rice dishes and soft serve ice cream for dessert (which was very good, choices were vanilla, chocolate and twists).  Noted items on the sashimi list: Unagi was an option which you rarely see.  My favourites Ika (squid) and Tako (octopus) were also available.  The egg was surprisingly quite good--salmon was nice but nothing extraordinaire.  Noted appetizer was the escargots--they were quite good, could use a bit more garlic but good nonetheless.  Agadashi Tofu was done very well.  Friends commended the crispy beef and we all enjoyed the calamari.  The bok choy and garlic and the Chinese broccoli dishes were sized well for one person and good as well, a bit salty but decent.  Friends loved the teriyaki beef which looked great, a bit pink on the inside suggest texture was not over cooked and chewy.  Kalbi on the other hand was too fatty and chewy.  The pad see ew was not great.  I wouldn't recommend that.  However, all noodles you were given a choice of: beef, chicken, shrimp or vegetables.  All in all, choices were good and fulfilling.  The Rolls selection has over 20 options which were great however, each came with 8 pieces and would only work for groups that can share the rolls. It was very busy and recommended is to make reservations unless queuing is your thing  I would definitely come back and try out the rolls!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 3 people just in case it was busy but when we go there, it wasn't as busy as we thought and so we were seated really quickly. The AYCE menus were quite extensive, given that you can order sushi, Chinese and Thai food, all at once. This is the first AYCE location for me where you would order verbatim instead of the usual ipad or pen and paper. I felt like I was bothering the waiter as we kept going back for more rounds haha. The food itself was okay, I did like the different choices they offered as you can't find them at other locations. It was a good place to try for the first time and it is pretty pricey (was around $33 with tax for Friday dinner). Service was okay as well!  A favorite of mine was the salmon tataki, basically seared raw salmon, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom since I had the mood for thai. I ended up forgoing the thai and getting sushi. The hostess was very nice and she seated us where I wanted. The waitress came right over with menu's and took our drink order. I got the tempura which was really great! crispy but not oily like some places. I like the small plates that way I can try more things. My mom really enjoyed her coconut shrimp but by far the best was the hand roll sushi and yam roll. I got the chicken satay but it wasn't really good. If you go you should get the fried wontons! SOOO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"To sum up my review in one line:  This place is so good we ate here two days in a row (tried another location the next day)  I am from Chicago and feel that is the best compliment I can give a restaurant, especially an all you can eat type place.  I've gone to other AYCE sushi places and brazilian steakhouses such as Fogo de Chao and while I liked them it never even crossed my mind to go back a day or even a week later.  We were only in town for the weekend and had to hit it up a second night since we knew we would miss it.  I thought I wrote a review last year but must have forgot.  The reason I am thinking about this place again is that me and a few friends are thinking about driving up to Toronto just to eat here again.  Anyway this is one of my favorite restaurants ever.  This restaurant was my favorite part of a long weekend visiting friends.  Only slightly less memorable then the day trip to Niagara Falls.  The butter fish and salmon tataki were very memorable.  Don't recall getting any bad items, if I had to pick a least favorite it was probably those little tuna pizza rolls that we tried because the table next to us was ordering one after another.  Service was above average considering how busy there were and how demanding running a place like this must be.  My friend and I consider this place the standard whenever we go to another asian restaurant.  Owner was at the second location we went to (not this one) and we enjoyed chatting with him after we mentioned we were at our second spoon & fork in two nights.  Great decor, great food, will be back.  Hope to follow this up with another favorable review since this place has been built up to stratospheric heights in our heads now..."}
{"text":"I came here for a luncheon party and the restaurant itself is nice and clean. And the staff is friendly with good service!  I tried a variety of items on the menu but I only remember certain items that were pretty good! I recommend to get the escargots. Cooked in a garlic butter sauce and served similar to cafe bouloud. Of course, not the same. The beef satay was good too, meat was tender and flavourful and the satay/peanut sauce on the side was good.   Sashimi was fresh, presented well and the thickness of the slices were average. I also ordered some unagi don and chirashi but I found it was a bowl of rice with 2 or 3 tiny pieces of fish- I don't recommend ordering.   However I found at at the end of our meal, I was really sleepy so I'm not sure if they use a lot MSG or something in their seasoning? -1*  The buffet was overall good, wouldn't mind going back and try a different spoon & fork location, but I would choose to try another buffet first for a new experience."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to be back in town to try this place again. I went here for lunch and did the all you can eat. I did that again for dinner this time. It was certainly worth it since they have a pretty good selection to choose from. Gosh I can't remember all of them, but what I ordered was the calamari, white tuna sashimi, fried tofu, curry chicken, and vegetable tempura. All was soo good. And yay, they have Asahi black. I wish I had a bigger appetite to try more. All this was just for one price! Pari was a great server, she also had help so they certainly got me covered. Would definitely come back here next time because this place is BANGIN'!"}
{"text":"The Basil Fried Rice, while having a nice flavour had the texture of sticky rice, which is odd for a fried rice. It also had a tiny bit of spice, I would consider it mild, but in case you're not used to spice, it might be spicy.  The Pad Sew was good, the chicken was well cooked, really nice texture. Noodles cooked well and overall flavour was nice. But the vegetables were very plain and felt like they were added in later. It was also very oily and the green onion slices were very slimy.  Service was great, very speedy and attentive. Our server checked in about 5-6 times, though towards the end of the meal he disappeared.  Overall it was a good experience, a few things could be better, but good overall."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at this location since it opened, and never got disappointed. The service is always on point, quick and professional. It's a fairy big space, so you're most likely to be seated right away, or wait for some time during weekends. The bar setup is very nice, so you could always chill by the bar and enjoy a drink or two until your table becomes available.  I have tried all other locations for the chain, this tops them all by far. Starting from the high-end trendy decor, to service and quality of food, there is no comparison.  I have tried the sampler/all you can eat option, as well as regular a la carte menu..the quality and freshness in both is impeccable.  The sampler option is fun for groups, you can order as many items to sample from, from apps, soups, mains or even sushi. While if you order from the menu, you get a full blown version of the same main, compared to the sample which is fair..but there is no limit to what or how many times you order.  Menu have it all from thai, chinese, Japanese and sushi. My best items are the coconut shrimp, calamari, shrimp tempura and the thick curry tiger shrimp in peanut sauce is a must try!  The price is great for the quality and service, It's a great choice if you're looking for a cool place to enjoy some great asian selections, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better AYCE sushi. Fish is not fresh, maki rolls consists of more rice than avocado/fish/w.e is supposed to be in your sushi, and the service is rude and slow."}
{"text":"The menu was ordinary, nothing special compared to the price. the very turn off point was that the desert was not included in the buffet! This was the only place i know have such stupid policy for all-you-can-eat. Never gonna go there again"}
{"text":"A BIG step up from my terrible experience last time...  I mean, at the end of the day , it is buffet and my expectations are low. but given there's no other buffet place that can top spoon and fork.  Their variety is amazing. Anything you can find from Japanese sushi, to good old steak and mash'd. It is quite pricey,. You're looking at about 40$pp after taxes and gratuity. But you go there for the variety and not so much for the seafood. You will be disappointing knowing all their seafood went straight from the freezer to the table."}
{"text":"When I stepped inside Spoon & Fork, I would never have know that it serves a Japanese+Thai AYCE menu.   The cushioned armchair, the table with wine glass setting and cloth napkins, the white table cloth., the dimmed lighting with candles on each table.. all scream for more high end AL la carte experience.. and I will be romanced...   However, nothing really romantic about going out to have AYCE on a date!! The sole purpose of AYCE for some are to eat and eat and eat and get your money worth.. and try to eat everything on the menu. So the concentration will be on the food.... not on how gorgeous I look!  Dinner AYCE ($24.99) is great value, We ended up trying:  - Thai Curry Pumpkin Soup/ Miso Soup - California Salad/Smoked Duck Sala/Wakame Salad/Thai Mango Salad - Thai Mussels/Chicken & Beef Satay/Takoyaki/Tempura/Thai Dumplings - Sashimi: Butter Fish/Salmon/White Tuna/Unagi/Octopus/Surf Clam - Maki/Rolls: Spicy Tuna Roll/Unagi Roll - Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai/Thai Spicy Noodle - Red Curry Fish and Shrimp - Taminard Shrimp - Mixed Vegetables  Most of the items we ordered were all surprisingly good.... especially the Thai Mussels in Tom Yum.. fresh big mussels and the Tom Yum was flavoured without being spicy (My friends does not do spicy!) We ended up having 3 orders of that!! Skip Chicken and Beef Satay, those were pre made and have been siting under a heat lamp for a long time.. dry and chewy...  Surprisingly as Spoon and Forks has its roots originally from being a Thai and Viet restaurant, their Thai dishes are not as good..at least for the ones I ordered. Pad Thai for sure was a disappointment as it is just overly saucy and sour.   Services is not bad! We got the food we ordered quickly..though we have to ask a few times to have our water glasses to be filled.  Though the deco scream chic and classy, but nothing really classy about all these people ordering from AYCE. Servers were all running around delivering plates and plates of food and busy cleaning up the tables... More like a scene from Diner Dash... and it is not a easy job to keep all of us hungry diners happy!!  I still think Japanese and Thai food doesn't mix even in an AYCE context. I tried really hard to eat all those mild and delicate tasting Japanese offerings first; Sashimi.... then move on slowly to the more intense taste: Thai offering...   Spoon & Fork is One of the best AYCE restaurant I have been. I highly recommend coming here if you are into AYCE as you will leave happy and full. But if you want high quality Japanese or Thai Cuisine.. you might need to go elsewhere and pay a lot more for that!  I am too eyeing their Lunch Specials ($15.99)!  *Since no dessert is included in the AYCE menu, S&P does have a separate dessert menu.. or you can take your date to somewhere nice and romantic for dessert and night cap and leave this chaotic AYCE scene behind.. and redeem yourself!"}
{"text":"Service was rough as this place just get slammed at lunch during the week.  Reservations a must. Menu is okay.  The red curry came with coconut rice which was a nice surprise.  Our pad Thai was a little flat in flavour..how do you screw up pad Thai? Veggie spring rolls were under whelming but mango salad was refreshing..not the traditional green mango tho, much sweeter.  Nice balance with dressing tho."}
{"text":"This is probably my go to restaurant for business casual lunch/dinners. The atmosphere is very relaxing and high class. It is also very spacious and perfect for last minute plans since making a reservations is not necessarily needed.   The AYCE menu is super diverse and made to fit multiple tastes from Japanese to Thai food. They have daily special menus for sushi as well as drinks, I had the lobster sushi roll and prosecco to drink which I really enjoyed! I highly recommend the beef and salmon tataki, and the coconut shrimp if you are into that touch of sweetness in your food. Anything from the grilled section is also prepared very well.  The price is great for the extensive menu as well as the quick service, this restaurant is good for anyone looking for a chill spot to enjoy some Japanese / Thai food. The location is also very accessible and has tons of other restaurants surrounded it so if anything you can walk over to Jack Astors or Scaddabush to enjoy a different selection of food."}
{"text":"I went for lunch time, as soon as I walk into the restaurant I'm waiting for at least 10 minutes. The hostess is nowhere to found. There's also 3 people in front of me waiting to get seated. My server forgot to ring in my order. I had to tell my server 3 times on what to order. When I ordered the beef and chicken skewers it came out raw. The washrooms are not clean. This restaurant has changed a lot in a bad way. Terrible food and poor service. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Stars: 3.5 *   About: Spoon & Fork is an AYCE that serves Chinese, Japanese, and Thai dishes. I believe they have four locations serving Japanese Thai; Vaughan, Queensway, Oakville and Mississauga. They do have other restaurants under the Spoon & Fork name but they serve either only Japanese (à la carte) or Thai Vietnamese (AYCE). This review is based on the Vaughan location which is located in the large Colossus Plaza. There is ample parking in the plaza, and the decor of the restaurant is modern and upscale.  Price: A friend and I went there for dinner a couple of weeks ago at their Vaughan location. The prices at Spoon & Fork was rather steep in comparison to the standard uptown AYCE. Dinner prices for Monday to Thursday was $26.99, and Fri to Sunday was $27.99 per person.   Menu: The menu offers a wide variety of items from appetizers, salad, sashimi, maki/hand rolls, noodles, sushi, curry, and many more. The menu also has clear and colorful pictures of a majority of the dishes.   Food: I am a fan of both Japanese and Thai food, so this was why Spoon & Fork appealed to me when I first learned of its existence. However, after dining here, I don't think the quality of the food really justify the cost of the weekend buffet. Perhaps it may be worth it if you go with a larger group, so you could try out more food. My dinner alone was a little under $45 (that includes the cost of dessert, tax, and tip) for a Friday night. The food was relatively decent for an AYCE, but there was nothing stand-out to me.  I'll start with the items that I did enjoy though. The crispy texture of the calamari was good, and the spicy fish sauce went well with it. The beef teriyaki arrived in one large piece, and uncut. This was the first time where I have seen it presented that way. Normally, it would either be shredded or in small pieces. However, it wasn't dry and rather flavorful. The bite-sized salmon sushi pizza was a favorite of mine, and each order comes with 3. The pad thai was edible, but unfortunately they covered it in ketchup instead of tamarind sauce. The fish quality was slightly above average and were sliced rather thin. Additionally, the hand roll, maki roll, and sushi were very standard for an AYCE. Normally, I loved chicken but none of the chicken dishes appealed to me as they were dry with little flavor (such as the chicken teriyaki and chicken wings). The rest of the items were rather average.  I was surprised that desserts wasn't included in the cost of the AYCE considering the higher price point. I can understand why they wouldn't include the deep fried desserts, but a bowl of ice-cream was an additional $4 for each flavor. Nonetheless, my friend and I decided to order desserts, as we were short on time to go anywhere else. I got the crème brûlée ($6.50) and my friend got the green tea ice-cream ($4). The portion for the crème brûlée was small, as I finished it in about 3-4 bites.  Service: From what I can recall; the service was good. Our server was welcoming, quick to take our orders, and clear the empty dishes. Additionally, the dishes came out at a reasonable time, and none of our food items were missed."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today (3 of us). After about a 10 minute wait, we were brought to our table. We then waited another 10 minutes before being asked only what we wanted to drink from a waitress who just happened to be passing by. We asked her if we could order and she rudely told us \"Don't order too much\". We ordered our food and it was about half an hour before the first tiny dish came, and about 15 minutes between each of the following plates. Our drinks were never refilled and the food was okay but really nothing outstanding.We then decided to get dessert menus, and found out that the desserts were not included in the all you can eat deal and were extremely overpriced.  After undergoing their TERRIBLE service, we got the bill which turned out to be $100.00 for just THREE PEOPLE at LUNCH. It was ludicrous, really. Please don 't waste your time and money here. No part of it is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such mixed reviews. I've been here for both lunch and dinner a couple of times and have never been disappointed.  Service is fast and friendly, I LOVE the menu and the quality of food is great for an AYCE.   Great chicken dishes, maki rolls and pad Thai. The best ever green dragon rolls are here, it is a must on the menu!  The price is above average for AYCE but I think is worth it based on menu and decor of the restaurant.   Tip: very busy on weekends and no reservations policy. Arrive early or plan to stand around the hostess table as there are only two chairs."}
{"text":"Price 3/5 - $12 desert + tea  Service 3/5 - no smile and bad  commands on English. not friendly   Food 3/5 - nothing special. regular food with lots of rice and fillings. main dishes very  average.   Will NOT come Back"}
{"text":"HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HERE FOR ALL YOU CAN EAT?! Oh man, if you have not, you are missing out! I have to say, I'm quite the AYCE sushi fan and so Toronto, Markham, Richmond Hill, Scarborough, Mississauga, Oakville... I've scoured a lot of places, and I'd have to say that this place is ranking pretty high up there in regards to price, quality of food and service. Atmosphere is a definite plus!  They do AYCE sushi lunch here and the food is just unbelievable for ayce quality. It's delicious and they have a good variety and includes sashimi too! The service is great and you're happy feeling like you're a real customer, not some bargain shopper squandering to get a few pieces of slimy fish from an unhappy vendor.  YUM! Definitely will come back here again for AYCE lunch!"}
{"text":"Attended a surprise dinner at this restaurant . The food was good and there was a good selection of foods to choose from.   My only concern was that they were a bit slow in getting our table ready, even though reservations were made to ensure the party would be seated before the birthday girl. It worked out in the end, but was a bit hectic.  I would try this restaurant again because I liked the food."}
{"text":"Very good and tasty food! For dinner the menu is even better, but more pricy as well. The environment is cozy and the service is good!"}
{"text":"When you go in everything looks very grand. We were seated right away but after that, it was where service started to go downhill. The hostess was able to get us a glass of water but when we where ready to order no one came by for almost 30 minutes. During that time I had to stop a few wait staff and they mention that they would be there in just a moment but it came to a point where I had to stop someone and force them to take our order.  At this restaurant they have an all you can eat menu and a regular dine in menu, I have had the regular menu before and the food was absolutely amazing, but to my surprise the all you can eat was terrible. Everything was either not hot, too chewy or too much oil.   For a resturant that charges that much, I expected better."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday to celebrate a birthday with 16 guests. I knew that with their no reservation policy Fri/Sat/Sun that I had to come early. I wanted to have a table for around 7:30pm so I came at 6:45pm and turns out that was still not early enough. Wait time on a Saturday is about 1.5-2hours but with the bar serving waiting customers, my group was okay waiting. We got a table just in time before everyone started getting hungry and cranky.  We got a nice table all together by 8:00pm. The policy for big parties is sort of a \"majority rules\" which makes sense. If most of the table is doing AYCE, everyone has to do AYCE (to protect from sharing food). I enjoyed the food and there were some standout items such as the coconut shrimp. Though it was really crowded that night, we were in no rush to eat fast or anything by the restaurant which I appreciated very much.   Some negatives about my experience is that because we were such a big group, orders got confused and for those who were sitting in the middle, such as myself, we didn't get some of our orders or they came very slow. The guests at the ends of the table got their food on time with no hassle. Because it was such a busy night, I didn't get to thoroughly look through the menu and tell the waitress what I wanted to order so I ended up eating off of my friends' orders.   I definitely recommend this restaurant though it is pricey but they have a wide variety that isn't typical in an all you can eat restaurant. I will definitely come back (either on a weeknight or earlier time if on weekend) to reassess the food and make sure I order things that interest me!"}
{"text":"Came here for weekend lunch AYCE with a party of 4. We were seated very quickly and service in general was really good. We tried both Japanese food and Thai food and both were right on spot in terms of taste and freshness. The tempura was battered perfectly, the fried rice was probably one of the best I've ever had, the beef teriyaki was tender, the sushi tasted fresh. The rainbow roll was a little odd in that it was not topped with alternating fish, but alternating fish and avocado. All in all, really good food. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"i love coming here for the variety of rice, noodles, soups, salads, sashimi & rolls! ayce for a very fair price & food quality tends to be pretty consistent. though my last 2 trips were a tad too salty (vegetables stir fry and noodle). i always get the beef tataki, basil fried rice, pad see ew, pad thai, duck salad, miso soup, an assorted sashimi platter and drinks! great spot for lunch or dinner. i had a birthday here before too. service is always friendly and the staff are pretty speedy w.the orders."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Those is my kind of buffet. The food is excellent but the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"Excellent food and impeccable service! Special thanks to Gordon for keeping our vacation memories alive by bringing the kids special mocktails"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure I understand my co-workers appreciation of this place. The food was...odd. It's called a Japanese-Thai fusion, but I'm perplexed as to why I was told that they weren't serving miso soup, a Japanese staple, at a Japanese-Thai fusion restaurant. (Despite it being on the menu.) Moving on, the satay chicken and beef were probably the best thing on the menu, but there's only so many skewers one can eat before it becomes lackluster. Somehow, the maki rolls tasted...burnt. I don't know if they roast their nori beforehand, but if they do, they need to just not do that. The service was incredibly slow and poor: when we did manage to get an order in, the waiters behaved as if receiving our order was the most taxing thing they've dealt with all day. We waited almost 30 minutes with a dessert menu and ended up kiboshing the entire idea because the waiter never came back -- we personally walked over to another waiter to ask for our bill. Why would you jeopardize your opportunity to make an additional sale given dessert isn't covered within the body of the AYCE menu. That seems a little ridiculous, but that's not even the worst part. The worst part is: I left hungry. I've been here already twice -- the second time was no better than the first time, and I definitely won't give it a third attempt."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I had an issue today where I was told by the cashier that I was getting more food than what I actually got. I drove off and noticed I had about half the amount of food I was expecting. I came back a little upset and asked for a refund. The staff explained the misunderstanding and ended up giving me more food than I payed for. In the end they rectified the situation and the food was delicious. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price."}
{"text":"Spoon and Fork is among, if not the most reliable AYCE sushi spots in Oakville. They have a number of locations which isn't a coincidence, they are consistent in their quality and service.   The fish is very good, and the bar is stocked with several beers and other spirits. In terms of the menu, they could stand to add a little more-- their Plus locations offer a much wider variety of sushi and other foods. However, there is enough here to have a nice meal.  It is pricey on weekends and at dinner so aim for lunch."}
{"text":"Love coming here when I want sushi buffet menu and decor that is more upscale! It is nicely presented.  They have lots of menu options that are not regulars at other sushi buffet restaurants.  They also have a lot of fusion dishes, western, Chinese, Thai etc. I love their smoked duck appetizers.  The place can be quite crowded so I would definitely go early."}
{"text":"Modern feel and really spacious.  This Japanese and Thai joint offers classic sushi, stir fry and curry dishes.  The \"all you can taste\" menu is overall a little unexceptional.  Small portions and cuts so ordering more is generally a good idea.  Creative maki roll selection with the Volcano a highlight.  Non-sushi items are presentable but a little bland.  Dessert selection is limited to soft serve for the ayce.  Service is generally friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Good food and a fun place but with a lot room for improvements. I celebrated my birthday with my family on a busy Saturday night. We all ordered buffet for the dinner.  Satay beef and BBQ eel sashimi were the best for those who want only cooked food. Salmon sashimi was very fresh and tasty.  The server was patient and nice to take orders from everyone on the table. There are few areas may need some improvements that would make our experience even better.  All buffet items were come in many small dishes.  Our table was too small to accommodate all these dishes and the waiters were too slow to take away those used dishes.  The buffet menu contains almost everything that one can expect from a Japanese restaurant but we were a little disappointed that it has no udon soup noodles.  Ordering buffet items is a messy and painful process as we had to write down the full name of each item on a piece of paper.  An electronic ordering iPad or a\"menu selection sheets may be easier."}
{"text":"I'd actually give Spoon & Fork 2.5 stars.  Since my first experience at the Vaughan location was great I thought it would be the same at the Oakville location. My sister and I arrived for a late AYCE lunch around 2 and it was still a bit busy. The interior of the restaurant is smaller than the Vaughan location and its interior decoration isn't as nice.  Service was quite slow throughout our visit because there were only 2 servers and 1 person making sushi for the entire restaurant. We were quite annoyed by the slow service since we didn't want to spend over an hour there.  The maki rolls were alright but they fell apart when we picked them up with our chopsticks. The pad thai and appetizers were pretty good though!  On the Oakville Spoon & Fork website it doesn't state that they have an AYCE lunch...but they actually do. Someone needs to update their website, perhaps? AYCE Lunch is $14.99 and ends around 3 pm.  The Oakville location totally disappointed me. If you want a great first experience, check out the Vaughan location."}
{"text":"Vaughan's location was great, Oakville's location was meh, and Etobicoke's location was good.  A group of us tried out their ayce lunch this afternoon and overall we would have to say it's pretty good. Service was pretty fast and consistent throughout our stay which was good. Surprisingly the sashimi took the longest to come out compared to the rolls which is weird since all you have to do is slice the salmon.  My fave items were the fried calamari, green dragon rolls, salmon sushi pizza, and obviously the salmon sashimi. Overall, all the rolls were good but they weren't rolled properly. The rolls kept falling apart or were slowly coming apart when it arrived at the table.  Note: Spoon and Fork doesn't do dessert for their ayce. It doesn't matter to me but I thought I would let you know just in case. Sunday lunch is $17.99.  Would I eat here again? For sure!"}
{"text":"Disappointed Enough to Write a Review. Each year we allow my son to pick a favorite restaurant for his birthday.  He picked Spoon and Fork Vaughn for his 14th birthday yesterday and his disappointment was heartbreaking. The first \"red flag\" was the staff sitting and smoking on the open garbage room as we approached.  The restaurant is very dark, but on a sunny afternoon you can easily see the dirty windows and door handles past the garbage and cigarette butts strewn over the closed patio. The staff were not overly friendly and we received little attention once we decided to order a la carte. The food arrived way to quickly and I would compare the food quality as the equivalent to that of a food court.  Despite being advertised as crab, all of the crab dished we ordered contained imitation crab meat or pollock.  If I had witnessed the men's washroom before dinner, I would not have eaten at Spoon and Fork.  Leaky faucets wrapped in towels, human waste on the floor, water damage stains and greasy prints everywhere.  There was no way that washroom was cleaned that day.  It was so bad that I felt it was my civic duty to tell the hostess to have it cleaned before someone gets sick.  I have eaten at a lot of restaurants and I never posted a review.  I felt that I had to share my experience.  For $160 (before tip) I feel I got cheated.  What's worse, I feel sad for the disappointment in my son's eyes over what was supposed to be his special meal.  The difficult part was not discussing how bad the restaurant was afterwards for fear of hurting his feelings for picking it."}
{"text":"My company has come to Spoon & Fork for our Christmas Party two years in a row and both evenings were very enjoyable! It's the perfect venue for such an event because everyone can order exactly what they want and nobody leaves hungry! I like the portion sizes for the AYCE because they are small enough that you can try several things and the quality is pretty good!"}
{"text":"The variety and taste of the individual dishes were as good as found in most restaurants, and all in one place. The sushi was amazing, and the hot dishes were surprisingly delicious with balanced flavor - and made to order. I recommend the  butterfish and surf clam shashimi. The rolls were also nicely presented and filled with fresh ingredients. It seemed that the dishes were in just the right amounts, letting you taste their nice variety of food. We found our favorites and ordered seconds of them. We went about 4PM, when it was about 1/3 full, so there was not a lot of competition for service or waiting for your food. The waitress admitted it can get crowded at peak times however. Bottomline is that I highly recommend this extraordinary find, I just wished there was a restaurant like this were we live in the states."}
{"text":"The decor is great and feels like a Milestones equivalent with Asian food.  The sushi was all made to order and the other food was delicious too.  The food is amazingly good quality for an all-you-can-eat style restaurant.  We found the service to be a bit lacking, and the price is fairly steep."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The ordering process for all you can eat is ridiculous. Having to call the server over for every item for an all you can eat is not efficient. The dinner menu is $26.99 and dessert is not included. Very frustrating and expensive dinner experience that I would not recommend. Value is poor."}
{"text":"I couldn't have predicted the demand for \"Asian\" food. All different cuisines in one place. The Thai dishes are much better than the quality of the sushi/sashimi"}
