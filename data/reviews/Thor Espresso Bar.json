{"text":"I walk by this place on the regular, and through the power of the Indie Coffee Passport, I decided to actually go in and check it out. It was crowded and very white, modernish interior, with an absolutely beautiful espresso machine. Their chairs aren't comfy and the interior was brightly lit with natural light from all the windows, so it's definitely set up as more of a pick up and go place than a sit down for a while place.  They charge extra for soy milk, and did so when it pushed the price over the $4 dollar Indie Coffee Passport limit. The service was indifferent and the soy latte was okay, but wasn't spectacular.   They don't have any vegan baked items, though I think they had something gluten free while we were there.  Since I have too many options for really fabulous vegan friendly indie coffee shops in the neighbourhood I probably wont return to Thor."}
{"text":"Ambiance/Good-Stuff  As the name suggests, this place definitely is a tribute to the Swedish style of home decor and it's quite minimalistic in style. Many reviews describe it as cozy, I describe it as lacking but I suppose that's the whole point. Being 6\"3, i found it really hard to sit in many of their chairs while their bar stools were uncomfortably positioned made this an awkward chill-out time for me. Fast and reliable internet, the lack of workspace makes it a hard sell if you want to do any work..  While the rude barista attitude can be forgiven(only one of them), the espresso-based beverages make up for it completely. My first impression of the Mjolnir shot is that it's a fantastic choice if you want something to give you a good kick (hint: mix the condensed milk and espresso quite thoroughly). I finished the experience with a simple cappuccino which actually might be one of the best and tastiest caps i've ever had the pleasure of drinking :)  Barista skills: 10 - A new favorite espresso shot + plus general great tasting coffee Barista Attitude: 5 - One was a total douche while the other was super nice about the whole experience Dating Appeal: 5 - Not my place to take someone out to have a long earth-shattering chat but it might be yours? Overall Ambiance: 6 - If i'm in Toronto and I want an \"out of this world\" espresso experience in my mouth then this is it (and yes, worth the amazing walk on King Street West :)). To hang/chill out? Not my style.."}
{"text":"Great Americano, lovely service. Nice little patio which I can't wait to sit on once it gets warmer."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee joints in Toronto - grab an Americano - you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is by far the best coffee in the city. My boyfriend and I go from Yonge and Eg all the way down just for a coffee if we're not busy and it's worth it every time. The food adn service is great there too. I don't drink coffee everyday, but if this place was closer to home I know I would drink it everyday. I have to mention that the prices are excellent too."}
{"text":"I've been to Thor twice in one week, and I don't even work or live the neighbourhood!  I think the lattes are tasty and beautiful, especially the vanilla bean with Almond Milk!    Their espresso-based beverages are made with care and both  times I've been, the service has been exceptional and warm without being fake.  Yes, it's small but we're here for the coffee folks!     I will definitely be back and hopefully, I'll get to try one of those donuts everyone keeps raving about."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way to Fort York after the restaurant we visited didn't pan out. The person making the drinks really cared about the job they were doing. The baked goods and breakfast burrito we had were really good.  Overall excellent service and product. My husband wasn't thrilled with his espresso, but my latte was pretty good. My daughter enjoyed her hot chocolate.  I might be giving this place a better review because we had phenomenally bad service down the street. My husband thought it was a bit expensive, but I think it was the neighborhood and the fact that it was Canadian dollars.we paid 25 for three drinks, two baked goods and a breakfast burrito.  Quality of service was pretty stellar."}
{"text":"It's my first time and I ordered a latte as I don't drink espresso and I am loving it!  The only comment  I'd make is that this place is really small. They only have about 8 chairs including bar seating. Not a place to get work done although they have free wifi. It is a nice place to chill with a few friends and do people watching little bit. I think they target the local neighbourhood and just walk over and grab and go type of customers. Just like other yelp-er says, love the decor! it's cool!"}
{"text":"Bumped back down to 3... I hoped their cappuccinos would improve, but they're still pretty bitter, or too light. Their americanos are okay.  On that note, they do have nice staff. Their signature drink, Mjollnir, works wonders if you're feeling sluggish. It has espresso and dulce de leche, but not enough of the sweet stuff to make you feel sickly or overwhelmed at all. If anything, it was a little on the bitter side of sweet.  The coffee here is good, better than your regular fare, but not outstanding, so I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to have it. Visit it if you're nearby, and try the Mjollnir."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I really wanted to be all over this place.  With a name like \"Thor\", how could you not?  I just always feel a bit underwhelmed whenever I leave.    Their menu is a bit confusing and requires explanations from the staff.  For example a \"Hit and Run\" is a shot of espresso while you wait and an americano to go.  A \"Mjolnir\" is 4 (or was it 2?) shots of espresso with condensed milk (a play on a Vietnamese favourite).  You can only get those 2 items if you have a few minutes to spare as those are \"drink in\" items only.  Would be greatly helpful if this was indicated on their menu board somewhere.  I also feel like pricing is a big higher than at your average independent shop.  I'll still pop in now and then, especially to FINALLY try the Mjolnir."}
{"text":"Good coffee, cute location, insanely over priced mediocre breakfast sandwiches. (Tim Hortons quality but for $6.50!) Instead, go around the corner to Atlas Espresso for an amazing breakfast sandwich for about the same price.)"}
{"text":"This is a nice cute little coffee place! I had latte with almond milk the other day. It was good, though a bit pricy ($4) for a small cup."}
{"text":"I love the Norse mythology themed mural.  I love the ultra masculine name. I love the helpful staff.  I switched to Americanos on the suggestion from an employee.  I love the baked offerings.  The location may be ideal for some but it is not close to my work so I visit only on days off."}
{"text":"Had a whole milk latte.  Very nice!  They also gave me a free eggnog scone.  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love their Americanos and their customer service! You are always welcomed with a smile in this trendy spot, only issue is they deserve a bigger place with a lot more sitting room in shop. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very good coffee.  Small space.  Outdoor seating quite good, weather permitting.  Baked goods not that appetizing, and expensive."}
{"text":"I was looking for the closest coffee enthusiast spot to me. I got a latte TO GO. As I'm drinking it now it is easily the best tasting latte I've had in my life. I'm now watching it from my window waiting for that cute girl to come out, because I'm stalking her."}
{"text":"Cool place - it's tiny, quiet, and laboratory clean with a small selection of Monocle magazines to browse. The staff are nice. The lattes are decent though not as smooth and thick foamy as I prefer. I liked the pumpkin spice latte which is one of the few places that offer it regularly.  This neighbourhood coffee shop kind of in the middle of nowhere (like the bridge going to Fort York), so it's a nice island of cool in a condo residential, traffic thoroughfare."}
{"text":"I made the pilgrimage to Thor Espresso Bar to try Glory Hole Doughnuts.  They are the retail front for these epic doughnuts.  We got there late afternoon and there was one doughnut left.  One the regulars offered us the last doughnut which was very nice of him.  We ordered a latte and a cappuccino.  Our caffeinated beverage were great, above average for most indie coffee places.   The doughnut was their coconut cream and it was divine.  I had to savour every bite, yes it was that good.  The cream had coconut shavings and the whipped cream was fresh.    Thor has free wifi, just ask for the password.  The only downside is that this place has limited seating.  I will be back to try out the other Glory Hole Doughnuts flavours.  I definitely recommend you check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened up, I've been wanting to go. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. It is small and when I went, the place was full. Not bad considering it just opened up.  They have a Slayer, a big fancy (and very expensive) machine where you can pull a variety of shots. I'm not a coffee expert, but I do know that I was served one of the smoothest lattes I've ever tasted. It didn't need any sugar and this says a lot as I regularly put in huge moundfuls of it in my coffee (I know, I'm terrible).  Because I had a soy latte, Patrick (the owner), was nice enough to make mine extra foamy.  Be prepared to get this coffee to go as seating is limited."}
{"text":"Thor is close to my house and closer than Jimmies so I go here sometimes. Overall, its fine. nothing great. friendly service but like most people say, its overpriced. You can go to Jimmies and get a better Americano for $2.25, compared to Thor's at $3.00. I went in the other day for a single Americano and it was one of the worst and weakest I have ever had. I told them so and even though they were trying to explain to me what a single americano is, (which this wasn't) they gave me a new one that was a bit better, but not by much. Will avoid this place in the future. Competition is high in this city with coffee and if you aren't doing it right, then there is no reason to go back"}
{"text":"Excellent espresso, along with an excellent macchiato. They didn't have a special blend available when I went, but the house beans were superb. I've had lots and lots of espresso and would qualify as a coffee nerd - for a no nonsense shot on a Wednesday morning, I was surprised at the extremely high quality of the shot.  Staff was friendly and gave tips on things to do in city, along with recommendations on other coffee shops to check out. Superb cafe, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Like all my other reviews, they are based on the coffee! The first drink I ordered was a Flat White, which they actually have listed on the digital menu (pretty cool actually). First thing to say, hurrah it's only one size (the correct size 6oz or less and is double restretto). It was a well executed and great tasting flat white.   The second I had was an americano which comes in a paper cup, it was quite tastey and nothing particularly wrong, but I'm not a fan of paper cups or \"pilot's\" beans.   If the beans were from some of my favourite roasters, I would have rated it more! Very pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"Soon to complete my big list of Indie coffee joints in Toronto I knew I had to get Thor Espresso Bar on the list as I've herd nothing but good about this place since it opened. The espresso bar itself is, as others have said, off the beaten path near Wellington and Bathurst. The place takes up a corner end of a street, a smallish cafe with windows for walls feeling much more open than it is. The decor is primary white offset with a beautiful mural on the wall of Thor and his hammer amidst the sea (note not the comic version of Thor).  If you've herd about Thor Espresso Bar you most likely have also herd that they are a proud owner of a rarely seen \"Slayer\" espresso machine. A simple but elegant espresso machine with huge chrome group heads and wooden levers. It also, with a competent barista, extracts wonderful espresso shots. Indeed that is exactly what I got, as the barista ground up some of their house blend espresso (roasted up special order by Social Coffee Company) and pulled a perfect shot from the Slayer. The espresso was fruity without being tart and well balanced. Me likey!  I also partook in a choco-banana muffin (my other weakness) which was baked up locally at some bakery named Leslie...Something or other, I think.  Yummy muffin anyways, thumbs up. As for the prices of food and coffee they tend to be about average to slightly above average comparably to other indie coffee joints.   What else to say...They got a cute Thor/Valkyrie cartoon on the washroom door, they also serve burritos and other more substantial edibles beyond simple pastries and they also have bottles of water with small glasses available if you need extra hydration.   I recommend worth the visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The best latte I have ever had in Toronto.  Plus the breakfast burritos are amazing."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this turned up on the second round of the Indie Coffee Passport! I'd not have ever gone out of my way to go there, I don't think (and I have to hold off on the 5th star because it really is out of the way, boohoo.)  We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon about 40 minutes before closing time - their menu has a nice load of espresso-based options and I went with an almond milk latte (they were out of soy) - it's seriously the best i've had in the city. With an $18,000 espresso machine, you would have to hope they'd get their shots and their steaming spot-on, and boy do they. Next time i'd love to try the vanilla bean latte, which was out of the coffee passport's price range, sadly.  There's a few snack/quick meal options in addition to the coffee/drink menu, but not a lot (at least, when we went - during the week could be different). The decor is clean and spartan, and there's a really awesome mural of Thor and his hammer (well, his tamp, anyhow!). A small amount of seating runs along the windows there, a few seats at the bar, and there's also washroom facilities. I don't know if i'd spend more than half an hour there, comfort-wise - but the coffee and the look of the place are a damn solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I came here for seconds guessing they had mastered the cappuccino but alas things haven't changed. The cappuccino is very mellow and you feel like you are drinking something  like a latte or at worse made from a powdered mix.  They had a brunch special for TIFF and it was 18$. It looked good and I would have tried it for sure wish they pick up their  phone as I called in twice before coming over to confirm the hours. ."}
{"text":"Do I drink coffee?  No.  I liked the friendly vibe.  Decor is very inviting.  They've got a nice patio.  They have a good selection of beverages, hot and cold.   Does it count that I've heard their coffee is good?    I'm just gonna give them 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Positive: good latte, nice spacious patio for the summer season.   Negative: $7 for a medium size latte, you make Starbucks looks cheap."}
{"text":"I have found my new favourite latte in Toronto.  In addition to the fact that they sell Glory Hole Donughts...I am putty in their hands.    The service is friendly, the place is spotless and if you manage to get yourself a seat, you can watch all the neighbourhood four legged friends pass by.  Why is this latte my new favourite?  It's the perfect middle of the road - not weak and not so strong that I feel like I could change the oil in my car with it.  I compare this to a wine tasting...different notes and tones and complexities.  If I was drinking from a clear glass I would be looking for legs on this bad boy.  The donut...I must try them all...but for a start I shared the peanut butter and jelly with my friend.  Huge, crunch exterior, peanuts on top, (what I think is) Welch's Grape Jelly inside, the creamy and oily texture of peanut butter.  It is fantastic. Although the donuts are available daily - you gotta get here early before they are sold out."}
{"text":"They don't take credit cards.  They only take Canadian debit cards, They accept US$ but at the same price as Canadian$.  Not really very fair, nor or they tourist friendly.  Too bad.  It's also super expensive."}
{"text":"Apart from reminding me of the Red Rocket Cafe on Wellesley, the first thing I noticed was their espresso machine, I don't know much about various machines but this thing looked like it meant business! Of course you then get distracted by their huge \"Thor\"/Viking mural behind the counter.   They don't have a huge menu and their food options are low, but they do have a drink called \"Thor's Hammer\" which they said came in an espresso glass but looking for more volume I opted for a latte which I really enjoyed topped with thick milk on top of some great tasting coffee. I would rank it as one of my favourite lattes in all my Indie Coffee Passport visits. I had a peach and camembert pastry which in hindsight I should have asked to get warmed up but was a great foray in to the world of fruit and cheese pastries (after a few minutes of no action I had to remind them about my pastry since they had forgotten, no biggie though).   I appreciate them taking the initiative of using an iPad as a cash/card terminal, but it was clearly taking up more time than a normal one would have. But the guy operating it seemed to be relatively new so I'll cut him a bit of slack.   I had my drink on one of very few seating options and if you're able to score a spot I recommend taking a moment to just sit there as it is a very pretty looking cafe, brightly lit and roomy for such a small location. And free wifi that worked without any problems despite not requiring a password.   Friendly staff too, so all in all a very solid bet for your cup of caffeine if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Best americanos period! Yum yum!  Thor strives to treat everyone as a regular and they even remember your drink!!! Xoxox never leave please!"}
{"text":"Thor may be small but its staff is super friendly, its baked goods are always fresh, and its service is super quick!   I often Ritual my order before walking in, and it's always ready within 2 minutes. It's located super close to a park so its great to grab a coffee for a quick stroll.  P.S. they also have a doggy bowl for those out with their pups!"}
{"text":"Thor produces an excellent latte. The flavour was slightly nutty and delicious without any added sugar or sweetener - I could sense no unpleasant bitterness whatsoever.   Service was friendly and price was average for these types of specialty coffee shops."}
{"text":"Go-to order, pick me upper, treat yourself...whatever you call it, if I'm splurging on coffee I'm coming here.  I'm a frequent coffee drinker so I can easily tell what I like and dislike in a good ol' cup o' joe, and this cup here is jolly good. Their flat white just soothes the soul.  Overall great place with hip decor, and most importantly, great coffee. I'm always greeted with a smile, and when there's a lineup for drinks using the espresso machine (which has happened more than once every time I've been to show how popular it can be for coffee drinkers in the area) the barista always chats people up to acknowledge he/she knows there's a wait.   All hail boutique coffee shops, all hail Thor."}
{"text":"Was here earlier today; the atmosphere is pretty nice and the drinks are good and made relatively quick. The place is small, but not too crowded as most people came to grab drinks to go. The only downside is that they did not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I visited Thor Espresso Bar a few months back when they first opened.  Upon walking in, I lustily gazed at the beauty that is both machine and art.  Their Slayer Espresso Machine... Wow, such a gorgeous centre-piece other than their mural.  But I digress.  After wiping the drool off my chin from my lustful gaze, I order my standard drink, the Americano as the basis of comparison for all other indie coffee joints that I've held in held in high regard such as Mercury Espresso Bar, Lit , Te Aro, Manic and Dark Horse.  I'm a bit put off as their espresso shot was a bit \"too bright\".. perhaps it a little too soon for their espresso beans from Social Coffee Co to be used, but they're new so I'll cut them some slack.  The space is nice, but a little too small for my tastes.  I usually like to lazily sit around, reading a book or chatting up the baristas getting to know their philosophy about coffee and how they got into it.  The space is in between the size of Coffee Pocket and Mercury Espresso Bar.. a little bit too snug for my tastes, I guess.  Anyhooo, I'm looking forward to more visits to this no fuss, no muss coffee joint :)"}
{"text":"- ~ Koffee Krawl ~ -   # 4  Feeling Coffee Wasted at this point of the Krawl.  The Thor Mural lept out at me like Imax 3D.  That was not nearly as cool as \"Vivek - God of Yelp\" brushing his Dark Grungy Mane to the side, Ladies beware as he draws your eyes like Medusa.  Zeus better step back!  The \"Slayer\" Espresso Machine does have Coffee-geekness like how people mod the shell of Desktop Computers.  The interior design reminds me of the Kids area in iKea for some reason, Fun times.  Slay me a beverage Gentleman while I chit-chat with the God of Yelp and his Disciples.  Btw, I was too high to remember what I/YOU said.  Huh?

{"text":"I am so not a coffee snob - at home I mostly drink instant Nescafe - but in my humble opinion Thor's coffee is truly amazing. Their americano tastes much smoother and richer than any other americano I've ever had. Maybe it's because of their \"slayer\" espresso machine, which is apparently like the Ferrari of espresso machines. This is more of a grab-and-go spot because it's tiny inside with very little seating, but in the summer there is a small patio and bench in front (which is dog friendly!) Kind of pricey but if you order on Ritual there are sometimes half-price deals."}
{"text":"Running by this coffee shop every time I go for a must-need run, I always tell myself that I need to try this place.... and knowing that they have Yelp Check in deals (1 free coffee for every 10 check ins), it seemed like a no brainer.  This place also does not have skim milk (i'm starting to find a trend), so I opted for a misto with vanilla bean syrup instead of a latte. They use real vanilla beans so I thought that was definitely a bonus. S got a full latte..... and I have to say that his latte delivered. It was creamy, aromatic, and I wanted his drink more than mine. While mine was not as \"milky\" it was still good, and full of real vanilla flavour.  Although I didn't get anything to eat - they have artisan donuts for eats. they were featuring lemon meringue and apple pie - IN DONUT FORM. they looked soooo tasty and beautifully presented too.  This place is definitely a new-tech coffee shop - with orders being place through the ipad and a sexy coffee machine. I think in the summer, it will be a great place to just sit out front and people watch."}
{"text":"Been there twice in 4 days - the espresso is amazing - at first, the initial hit on your palate is very strong, not exactly bitter, but surprising and bold.  Then, the flavor rolls out into chocolaty/cinnamon overtones and the buzz lasts for hours!  They 2 guys running the show are sweet as pie and they have arranged fresh roasting of their beans up in Richmond Hill twice a week, which in my mind, ensures fresh coffee constantly and for $12/bag to take home and use in my Jura-Capresso, it's totally worth it!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Just north of where Front street ends on its Western end (at Bathurst) is this modernist, minimalist coffee shop. Clearly a neighborhood coffee place where people make a pit stop on their way to work (probably on foot or a nifty little bike). Seating is kind of minimal. It's in the corner of a medium rise condo and surrounded by some similar medium rise condos. A pleasant enough place to maybe end a foot tour of the downtown.   And they're open Sundays."}
{"text":"Thor is a little espresso bar that just opened up about a month ago right across from the dominos on bathurst.  I found out about this place after having most of the people at the climbing gym say that the coffee was really good there, so I had to go give it a whirl.  Upon entering, you'll notice that there isn't really very much space, I mean, there are maybe a total of 6 chairs and 4 stools.  I guess they don't have a lot of chill space (pity).  The decor is probably one of the coolest things there.  Most of their furniture is made out of 2x6's glued together with wood glue.    The highlight piece they have right over the bar is actually a painting of the god of thunder himself thor, wielding his mighty... espresso tamper.  LOL amazing painting (check out the picture).  One thing I really appreciate about this place is that they do latte art for their coffees.  I got a macchiato (2 shots of espresso and a little bit of milk) and it came up with a nice leaf design on top.  Being a barista at starbucks for a while, I had the opportunity to try making latte art on our downtime (I was pretty determined to learn how to do it on starbucks' dime).  Trust me, it's a pretty refined art to do it consistently very well.  It's a nice little touch to have with your coffee.  The coffee tastes just about right.  I've had people pull bad shots from machines and know what espresso does if you leave it too long (again... testing on starbucks' dime... ps i was an awesome employee or \"partner\").    They do have fresh pastries that they serve, but I didn't really have any and can't really comment.  All in all, definately a nice place.  The only thing I don't really like about it is the lack of space.  I came in here with two other people and ended up sitting on the window sill.  It was \"padded\" but it was quite cold on my backside.  Last note... the name of their espresso machine is called the Slayer... How can you go wrong with that?  I mean whoever came up with this machine knew what he was doing.  \"I'm going to make the most kick-ass machine out there, and then to top it all off I'm going to call it the Slayer\".  Oh, and it's only $18,000 dollars.  Maybe that's why they don't have seating space... =/  BTW, here's a site of what the machine looks like.  http://gizmodo.com/5451517/a-little-18000-espresso-machine-called-slayer"}
{"text":"Cute coffee spot.  Prices for drinks on point but as other yelpers have mentioned the prices for baked goods are high.  I paid $9 for a latte and scone. As I'm always in the area I'll definitely be popping back in.  I looks like they have a cute patio area too, will be beautiful in the summer.   Overall coffee quality 10/10, atmosphere 9/10 a little small, service 10/10."}
{"text":"Review based on the donuts only!  They are now getting deliveries of these hard to find gourmet donuts a few times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sat and Sun (don't know if I should have saidi that because I don't want competition).  Be warned that it is very tricky getting donuts here because they sell out really quick.  How quick you ask?  Well they open at 8am and by 10:30 on some days they are completely sold out.  Now mind you, they don't order alot.  They get a few varieties and it is always changing but they usually don't get more than 20 in total.  Filled donuts are  $4.25 a piece, lemon merringue is not bad, the cocunut cream pie didn't leave me wowed.  The donut is very soft (but I suggest you eat it shortly after you get it.  If you eat it later in the day it can taste stale).  But the cream and filling was tasteless and waste of calories IMO.  Only downside to this place is that they do not have boxes if you are just buying a few donuts.  They were going to cram it into a small paper bag (suitable for bagels) which would have been terrible given the layer of cream on the top.  I brought my own container and the guy didn't even bother putting the lid on it for me.  He just left it on the counter."}
{"text":"Gosh, it sure is intimidating to write a review for a place that has four stars as an average rank. That being said, I shall plow forward!  Ever since I had heard of this place, I wanted to go! I am very glad I did. You really should go to any place that calls itself Thor.  I think of a couple things: comic book store or some sort of man bar.    The place is modern but not as modern as I had envisioned if you can believe that. At the time I walked in, it seemed cluttered.  In a modern space, anything that is strewn about can make a place look messy than a normal cafe.     They use Origins coffee.  One of my faves! Another espresso bar uses it as well and I have to say, in drinking the same brew, they do it better!!!  Thor makes an okay cup but it does fall short of the other espresso bar using the same beans.  I would come back here if I was in the area again!"}
{"text":"They have Glory Hole Doughnuts here. That, in and of itself, is enough for a 4 star review. Since Glory hole doesn't yet have a storefront space, and I can't write a direct review for them without an address, I'm going to enter my Glory Hole Doughnut review here:  Oh. My. God. So they are called \"Glory Hole Doughnuts\", but my enjoyment of these doughnuts went well beyond sexual, all the way to religious and communing with the divine.   I pray to the church of Glory Hole Doughnuts.  I'm actually quite bothered by the name, the irreverence doesn't suit the serious nature of these bad boys. This is a real triumph of baked goodness. I've only had the lemon meringue, and I don't need to try any of the other flavours. I'm sure they are great, and I'll list them in a second because they may be even better than the lemon, but I can say that this is one of those times that I may only have lemon for like the next 2 years, because I am already that addicted, and will be unable to try any others till my addiction runs its course. The lemon meringue doughnut is RIDICULOUSLY PHENOMENAL. It is a glorious triumph of doughnuttiness. It is a revelation. I really can't say enough about it. The lemon curd is potentially the BEST lemon curd I have ever had, and I'm something of a lemon curd aficionado. It's tangy tart sweet fantastic, and it tastes like ripe lemons warming in the sun after a light summer rain. The doughnut itself boasts a marvelous doughnuttiness, that perfect textural amount of give and resistence and chewy yum that makes a pastry so enjoyable when you bite into it. It's just plain tasty. The lemon curd and the perfect meringue complete the Glory Hole package, and it's simply magnificent in every way.   Given the incredible wonderfulness of the Lemon Meringue, I do one day look forward to trying their other flavours: Maple Bacon, Coconut Cream, Apple Pie, Fried Chicken & Waffles, Cinnamon & Sugar, Dolce de Leche & Hazelnut, Peanut Butter & Grape Jelly, Puddin', and Smores. Holy. How did the world get this far without these flavours! Evolution is a powerful and beautiful thing.  Glory Hole Doughnuts are apparently still looking for a storefront location in TO, for now they deliver(!) by the half and full dozen, and are available at Thor Espresso and Burger Bar on select days. They Tweet @gholedoughnuts. Definitely grab one at Thor with a creamy Americano.   It's rare that a bakery comes up with something entirely their own, truly unique and special. Glory Hole Doughnuts has transcended the standard whatever, and these doughnuts are something so high in quality, execution, and flavour, soooooo fresh and tasty and wonderful, well, I just wish them all the best in the world. Keep on baking, peoples! Everyone needs to try these doughnuts!!!   PS. I am not crazy, I just really like doughnuts. :)  PPS. Thor is really awesome too. Great coffee and an awesome space, futuristic ordering and really nice people. I like to go to there. You go too! :)"}
{"text":"This is exactly what I needed today around noon, when the snow was falling, and I was only mid-route (I'm a dog walker).   This is quite honestly the *best* americano I'd ever had.  I'm a regular at a few different coffee shops in the King West area, but I'm changing my daily route, and going one block out of my way, just so I can grab a coffee at this place!  As everyone has already mentioned, The Slayer is a beautiful and stunning machine. You can't help but notice is when you walk in the door.  The place is very casual, and doesn't have crap all over the walls. It's clean and airy, but still maintains that warm feeling you'd want your local coffee place to have.   The 2 guys working there (who I think both own he place) are cool guys.  I just happen to chat about my dog walking business, and one of the owners has a couple of dogs!"}
{"text":"Excellent latte, cute and eclectic mural of Thor on their wall .. Even their espresso machine is designed with the theme in mind!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend in the middle of a weekday; I was looking for a really good cup of brewed coffee.  The cafe is quite small and not overly \"stroller friendly\", but we managed with my infant son given that it wasn't busy.  Unfortunately, my coffee wasn't the really good cup of coffee I was looking for.  I'm giving this place four stars because of the fact that it's independent, the atmosphere is cool, and I'm sure that the speciality coffees are great as per feedback from other reviewers.  I might try something else from this place sometime in the future."}
{"text":"My favourite coffee spot in the city.   I always order their flat white. It's got a lovely hint of chocolate and is so smooth and creamy.   If I'm stopping by for breakfast, their white cheddar and chive scone is my go-to."}
{"text":"I had coffee and doughnuts. The coffee was fine, nothing special. The Glory Hole donuts tasted ok, and sat in my stomach like a greasy ball of dough. I shared the coconut cream, pudding and chicken n waffle donuts and the consensus was, \"They're ok.\" I wanted to like the donuts more than I did, and I was hoping the coffee would taste better than it did, but alas, that wasn't the case. I'll still pick it over Tim Hortons, but that's not much of an endorsement, is it?"}
{"text":"Service is always great, but why do i find this place slower than some others? I remember coming by when you first opened. I was impressed with the new mechanicals parts they invested at the coffee bar. At the time, the espresso beans for the latte were not as strong as I would prefer. I'm glad I went back last week, it was good! I still prefer Manic, Darkhorse, and Rooster though.  Not a place I would want to linger, just grab and go. It doesn't have that environment even though it's a funky place to hang out for a bit."}
{"text":"I love the espresso and friendly service at Thor! They are a neighbourhood gem!  Major points for offering almond milk as an alternative to milk or soy! They also have some great vegan treats and things for the gluten-free population!"}
{"text":"I`m a huge fan of ODIN and was delighted to see Thor when I moved to the neighbourhood. I`ve been twice before work and the staff members are incredibly friendly and pleasant. Unfortunately both times I didn`t receive what I had ordered. The first time my drink wasn`t correct and the second time I my breakfast sandwich incorrect. I had ordered a veggie breakfast sandwich and when I got to work discovered it had bacon on it. Not a pleasant surprise for a vegetarian. Incorrect orders didn`t seem to be all that uncommon as there was a gentleman who came in after me with a Ritual order and for the second time in a row they made the wrong drink for him."}
{"text":"My visits to Thor have been brief but in all, I have found this cafe to be warm, inviting and pleasant. The owner (or co-owner because I believe there are two) is friendly and I always end up chatting with him for a bit. The last time we spoke he asked me to sample some fresh juices he was planning on selling at the cafe.  I love the minimalist decor which compliments the beautiful mural behind the bar.   Their Americano is good, though not strong enough for my liking. I have enjoyed their cappuccino and mocha.   I'd like to come here and chill one of these days, to sit by the window and let the sun beam in. It seems like a good place for it.   Another incentive to visit Thor: they receive the latest issues of enRoute magazine, which is one of the best culture mags around."}
{"text":"Stopped into Thor for a quick Americano. The space is pretty small, but lovely. Per Joe H.'s review - I was THORoughly impressed with the large mural on the wall with the Espresso Tamper.  Further, the custom-designed espresso machine with Thor wings was equally as awesome.  We enjoyed a latte and americano outside on the small patio they have on the side. Given the chilling weather these days, I don't think patio days can last much longer past October. I would definitely come back here if I found myself in the King/Bathurst area!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually have the coffee here... (came on the coffee crawl with a group of Yelpers and was pacing my caffeine intake). But I did have a delicious and fresh grilled vegetable and goat cheese panini. Two thumbs up except that it came to $9.72 with tax. What? (I should have been wary because there was no price marked on the menu).   The space is beautiful and very design-y -- huge mural behind the counter, going with the Nordic/viking theme. They were selling these cool wooden map of Toronto coasters. Thor is also going to be part of the CONTACT photography fest pretty soon -- something to look out for. There are some bar stools and a few chairs/coffeetables, but this is more of a pit-stop place rather than somewhere to linger for a long time. They have great reading material on hand -- travel magazines and Wallpaper city guides.  Staff were really nice and even gave us a shout-out on their twitter."}
{"text":"The pastries here are top notch! They now serve Alfajores and they're home made. Yum! They taste lemony and sweet. But the cookie is superb and crumbly as it should be. Can't wait to see what else they come up with."}
{"text":"i'm not a coffee connoisseur, but i've been to many of the city's best and to me thor is among the top. the staff are competent and the coffee is consistent.   the furnishings aren't anything to write home about and it feels cramped during the morning rush. however, i've never stayed more than a few minutes. the all-day cookie is very good (not quite \"all-day\", but it's satisfying)."}
{"text":"Like another person wrote, I so badly wanted to fall in love with this place but I was a bit underwhelmed. I had discovered this place because it got recognition for its logo design on a dutch blog (I was doing research for marketing), so on that end it's pretty neat.  Like many cafes in Toronto, it's pretty pricey. The desserts are also alright, but once again, pricey. Unlike many of Toronto's cafes, the service is very friendly and the drinks are well made.You would think that this place would be snobby, but my experiences have always been good. The baristas are genuinely friendly and don't have that awful habit of ignoring you for 5 minutes to chat with their friends.  The cafe is very small, but there are some plugs inside. So if you can snatch a seat it's not a bad place to work."}
{"text":"The menu isn't too extensive, but what they do serve is of better quality than what you're used to in Toronto.  The owner is a really nice guy & will go out of his way to accommodate an order even if it's not on the menu (i.e. iced chai latte)  It's also a nice corner to sit with your warm treat and watch the neighbourhood folk."}
{"text":"Great coffee, they're brewing a Pilot roast. Tastes the way I know and love. I got a flat white.   The sugar and milk station is also the top of the garbage, which is right in front of the door, and it's a tall garbage with a pretty wide mouth that takes up most of the surface area, so adding stuff to your coffee is awkward.  Staff is poorly trained in terms of things every staff member who works in food and beverage should know--they can't answer a simple question every other place can answer: \"does your pesto have pine nuts?\" I knew as soon as I saw their confused looks and had to explain that pesto is a sauce that traditionally has pine nuts, that I wasn't getting an answer. The two girls working Saturday morning looked at each other in confusion, couldn't come up with an answer, and instead showed me the point of sale software and said \"just pesto!\" That doesn't answer my question, but thanks? Every single other place I've been to in Toronto knows the ingredients of the stuff that they sell, especially common allergens like tree nuts, so why is this place any different?  I can get Pilot roasted coffee at a lot of cafes which doesn't make this place unique in terms of what they offer, and with the staff who is either too lazy or too poorly trained to figure out ingredients to their food, it takes the uniqueness of the food items I haven't seen elsewhere out of reach, so I can't say this place is compelling enough to try again if I'm trying to grab coffee and a quick bite.   They're pretty conveniently located, and they're on Ritual, so if only the staff knew what they were doing I could go here all the time because it would've been convenient. I'll just go to the countless other places I already go to for now that have more options and can answer questions about common allergens in their products."}
{"text":"I love this place! The soy latte is in a word perfect...and I actually mean perfect. Yes, it's a bit more expensive than other cafés in the area, but it's definitely worth it. Great baristas, nice crowd and a little patio for warmer days."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav \"indie\" coffee shops I've visited in Toronto so far.   One thing that makes it special (for me) is it's somewhat \"off the beaten path\" location means that there are not 40 million hipsters crammed inside.  There are not a lot of seats, but there is enough seating inside for 10 or so people. So it's not like Sam James where you are kicked to the curb because there is no seating.  I loved the well-stoked area of travel guides and books about food (2 of my favourite topics) to peruse whilst drinking your coffee.   They do not brew \"regular\" coffee on the weekends for some reason. Weekdays only. So you'll have to grab an americano if you visit on a Saturday/Sunday."}
{"text":"Oh Thor, never change. Well I guess you could be a little more inexpensive but really for the quality - never change.  I've always received friendly, snob-free service here and am happy to be a repeat customer. My vanilla latte is ALWAYS good, there are times when it's very good and other's it's just good. But really, that's a scale I can get behind - good to very good. Today was very good!  I wish they would expand a little on their treats but what they do have is always delicious. I was apprehensive to try the empanadas but since they were out of the meat pies I gave it a go and yum!   For some reason my phone charges on their neat wireless charges without the dock. I think you can unlock this super power if you drop your phone enough times (don't do it).  ---  Dropped a star because I was never offered a loyalty card, though I've been going for months. Finally got one and realised by now I would've gotten two free drinks. For how expensive a drink there is...they really should give those out to everyone."}
{"text":"The guys at Thor are fantastic. The Slayer machine is a thing of beauty.  I have a three-way tie for my favourite latte in Toronto, Thor is one of them. The space is minimal, functional and very cool. The espresso is fantastic, rich and creamy - no need for sugar, not even a grain of it. Go to Thor, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"In the immediate area its the good ol local coffee shop.  Keep up the good work. Check hours though - closes early.  Not much seating."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first walking past this place bur I was pleasantly surprised. We walked into the small cafe and it was really bright, hipster and the baristas were super nice and energetic. Their matcha latte was pretty good and we had a seat outside in their little patio area. Not much of a view but super relaxed and bright atmosphere. I would say its fine for a casual coffee in the afternoon if you're looking to get away from the trendier, busy coffee shops in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"Thor Espresso Bar is our 4th stop for our Koffee Krawl.   White, Ikea feel, clean and bright is my first impression of Thor!   Though with minimum seating, the place was empty.. aside from one lone patron sitting by the corner, I successfully scared him away and hoarded the whole area at the back to be OUR spot to hang out.   So while my caffeine loaded yelp friend busy chatting up the girls and the almost awake and just as sexy looking messy hair Vivek, I lined up to order our cappuccino...   Hey is it really a cappuccino... or a latte? I should not be complaining about that super sized cup of java compared to other places but it was just to milky for me.. can barely taste the coffee... and I slowly knows that I have enough milk intake for the day.... next one I need to skip the milk but not the coffee! :)  I can see Thor as a place to hang for awhile with friends but not as a place to park myself for a long time using their WIFI... and there are not tables? Now this is a place that would not turn into a \"library\"..."}
{"text":"Thor is across the street from home, and I couldn't wait to get in there for a coffee when they opened last autumn.  Well, it's been open for a bit, and I thought that I should jot a few notes about Thor.  First - the service is great.  You might think, \"Who cares? What about the coffee?\"  Well, this is my neighbourhood, and its my neighbourhood coffee shop.  I want good service.  The owners know their customers and remember them ... when they walk in the door, their orders and names are remembered.  Second - the coffee is great. I have been trying different single-origin espressos during each visit. They use a Slayer Espresso machine.  Top notch.  Great crema. Great pour. Interesting flavour profiles on their coffee - not what you might expect from a shot of espresso!  i don't drink lattes, but the barista (Patrick) can steam milk like a champ. His milk pouring is seamless, smooth and artistic. The foam is creamy and micro.  All in all - Thor rocks.  Great job!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Came here on a Wednesday afternoon for a coffee break. The shop was pretty empty. I ordered a latte and it was made really quickly and beautifully with some latte art on top. $4 for a latte, price is pretty standard. The latte was perfect. Stronger on the espresso side, perfect temperature, milk steamed to a foamy (but not too foamy) perfection! 5 stars for this latte. It was really, really excellent. Decor is nice, kind of Nordic inspired. My only complaint is that they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Like the branches of glorious Yggdrasil bathed in shining loam, Thor Espresso Bar is a breathtaking sight. When you visit this Bathurst St spot (just south of King St) you will notice their epic (finally an apt use of that term) mural of their namesake; his swirling mane depicted in lush blue. You'll also feel like you're in Mac commercial as everything is stark white and minimally decorated. There is a iPad on the wall and their cash register is a Macbook Pro. Definitely Stevie J approved.  I stopped by with some yelpers for a quick coffee. My macchiato was the first drink to touch my lips that morning and it was actually perfect. I also grabbed an All Day Cookie (though you can eat it at 4am if you want to) but I found it was a little dry. The other pastries looked pretty tasty though.  Not a great place to bring a laptop or work as it's rather small, but with a good collection of books and hip magazines (Juxtapoz!) this is a swell place to decompress with a quality cup of joe. I'll be back!  Obligatory Title Pun: This little coffeeshop RagnaROCKS.  Menu Readability: I couldn't take my eyes off that mural.  Need to mention: They take debit and cash only.  What this place teaches me about myself: I like my coffee like I like my mythology: polytheistic."}
{"text":"The vanilla bean latte (with almond milk) was delicious.  & how thrilling for this lactose-intolerant person with a thyroid problem to have almond OR soy milk as an option.  It is so small, it is a better grab & go coffee place (well-suited for the neighborhood, I imagine) & the seating isn't exactly comfortable in the \"hey, stay here for the afternoon\" type of way.  Next time, I'd like to get there in the morning to give one of those doughnuts a try.  I also totally dug the wall mural.  It is beautiful."}
{"text":"Great coffee, delicious cookies, great vibes, nice sitting, awesome client service! Very cool spot in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Best coffee in town. Ps try their power cookie. Makes great healthy breakfast on the go."}
{"text":"Great local espresso shop.  They have the best espresso I have had in Toronto, especially if you prefer a less bitter roast.  I saw someone write they thought it was too light, I assume that he is just familiar with Starbucks' burnt espresso and can't appreciate good espresso.  For those who want the espresso but not the all the caffeine, their decaf espresso is some of the best I have ever tasted as it maintained its richness and flavour very well.  Their food/bakery options are limited but taste decent (I would say 3/5 stars).  With homemade syrups for flavor shots and well trained full time staff, quality is important to this place.  Not the best espresso bar I have ever been to, but it is the best in Downtown Toronto that I've tried thus far."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I found another latte favourite! +5 life points  My latte was $4 here in this small, tiny, little, mini, itty-bitty coffee shop. There is SOME seating but the shop is only big enough for one long lineup. May I comment on how STRONG* this latte was? But caffeine level isn't why I drink coffee though. I just love coffee! And they do not disappoint.  *my caffeine \"defence\" level - I can sleep well even with caffeine at 10pm. This latte kept me pretty active for 10+ hours.  From the outside, it looks similar to its neighbour the dry cleaner. But inside it's adorable.   Service is A+"}
