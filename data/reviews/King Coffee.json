{"text":"They have vegan donuts here ( not everything is vegan, but you have to ask ) and they are sooooooo good, very tasty and not dry at all ! The Wild Rabbit makes their vegan donuts and even though they are $4.00 a piece, they are sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Their lavender earl grey ice tea is one of the best I've ever had. The people who work there are very friendly. Great place to read, work and catch up with friends. The atmosphere is calm and not pretentious at all compared to other shops in the neighborhood. New favorite place."}
{"text":"I have absolute love for this place.  Parking around back is a necessity unless you get the one golden spot out front.  It's a small little independent place without all the stuffy pretension and cooler-than-thou vibe of Cartel and others.  The barista are welcoming and nice without being over-the-top.  The baked goods are delicious.  And of course, the coffee drinks in all forms cold and iced are delicious, and the teas are fantastic too.  All much more superior to other close by options. I only wish the place was bigger because it's possible I might ant to live there."}
{"text":"I come for the cinnamon rolls, cold brew, and warm ambiance, but I stay for the baristas.   This place keeps me caffeinated and uplifted when I am feeling low, and I highly recommend the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly staff! Straight up ... Their cold brew is much better than Cartel Coffee's. If you need your caffeine fix this SHOULD be your spot in North Tempe!"}
{"text":"Delicious lattes. Now that they expanded and remodeled, there's a good sitting/study/work area to enjoy them in."}
{"text":"coffee was fantastic and employees were friendly, but misgendered me and my friend who i came in with. definitely plan on returning but hope that there's more trans-awareness and where we don't have to worry about our genders and pronouns being assumed."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a three star rather than a four or five for one reason:  the overly loud music.  It's not just King that does this.  Have you been into Cartel lately?  I don't know why every cafe feels they have to blast out their customers when said customers already have their own music devices and want to listen to their own music.  So, they are forced to turn up their own volume to block out the house's volume.  Makes no sense.  If you want to know what what the ideal cafe is, check out Gold Bar in Tempe, which has no music.  That's right, none!  Beautiful silence.  Maybe that's why they get so many loyal students in there.  I find the more I go to Gold Bar the less I can tolerate noisy places.  That said, I really like everything else about King Coffee; the great location, friendly staff and owner, coffee, vibe."}
{"text":"Cute and funky. Has a Northern Cali feel. Owner knows his coffee. Very tasty drinks. Dessert options are limited but local and quality in taste. Good luck to them!"}
{"text":"I visited them 3 times on my recent trip to a workshop on biblical exposition at The Church on Mill in Arizona.  Their cold brew was good! I ordered it twice, a danish, and two cinnabon's  (not all at once, of course!).  Check them out."}
{"text":"The caramel latte that I tried was awesome. The service was also good. I would say that you must try this place!"}
{"text":"King Coffee is my favorite spot to escape the daily stresses of school. It's right across the street from ASU School of Music (as well as the ASU Art Museum), so I'm there almost every day I go to school.  About the space:          Very cool ambience; I especially like that they have local artists on the walls of varying multimedia. The other biggie is that the place is seriously unpretentious (unlike a certain other nearby coffeeshop, no t no shade).          The coffee shop expanded in August 2016 and it's felt like home to me ever since (previously the space was just a little too intimate to be comfortable). They have two little nooks for those who want to study in peace as well as comfy chairs, couches, tables, and outdoor seating. Re: outdoor seating, I've seen plenty people park their dogs for a sec and enjoy a nice latte outside with their furry companions. Like most coffee shops, there is water that you can bring your pup as well.  About the food/drink:         My favorite drinks to get are: the cold brew (I would say this is a King Coffee favorite? It seems popular, from my exploits eavesdropping on others in front of me in line.), an iced lavender earl grey, and an iced rooibos tea latte.          The sandwiches are pretty good; they come pre-made daily and are grab-and go. If you buy them in the evening, usually they are discounted. I love their new veggie burritos; they come with salsa and are great slightly warmed. There's a vegan matcha cake they have occasionally that is to die for. Their cheese danishes are also super delish. Sometimes they have the most amazing and huge honeycrisp apples for a pretty affordable price.   About the service:      This is my favorite part of King Coffee. I'm friendly with most of the baristas/owners because they are such friendly and kind people. Even when I'm dead from lack of coffee, they help brighten my day. Quite often if I'm wearing a cute outfit for the day, for instance, one of the baristas will compliment me; these people are kind, hip, and easy to talk to. Having a friendly connection with the staff is a huge motivator to come in.         Some of my favorite events have happened at King Coffee as well. There used to be weekly poetry nights. Now a great poetry organization called Criss Cross Poetry uses the space as their monthly venue. They've also hosted benefit concerts for refugees and generally are great spaces for musicians.         Btw, they have a loyalty punch card system: if you get 10 punches, you get a free drink. If you get 10 cards each with 10 punches, they give you a free King Coffee t-shirt."}
{"text":"Such a cute and delicious coffee spot. They just expanded and remodeled and it looks great! I love coming here on the weekend."}
{"text":"First time here tried and the mocha latte with soy and it was delicious. I will come back to try their tea and pastries. My gf and I are always trying to find new coffee shops with chill spots and good coffee and tea."}
{"text":"This response is more about a specific incident rather than the coffee. Overall I've always liked King. It has friendly staff and great coffee. However, there really needs to be an update on protocol on how to handle awkward or possibly threatening situations caused by homeless people. There are a few options to sit outside King so sometimes there will be a homeless person lying down or seated and every time I've been there while a homeless person is there they stay around because they're not bothering anyone.  But just today I was at King and a homeless man was outside lying down. After a bit he got up and started to go up to everyone outside. When he made his way inside he propositioned me for sex and instead of kicking him out, calling the cops, doing anything, the barista asked if he would like a cup of coffee. That's right, instead of doing something about it she asked to serve him coffee. I told him to get away and when he went outside he kept going up to people and lingering. The barista asked me if I was okay so she obviously heard what he said.  After about 15 minutes he reappeared in front of my view, on the other side of the window, and tried to get me to look at him. When he banged on a door that is usually locked another barista told him to stop, but did not tell him to leave or did not call the police or do anything to take care of the situation.  When I went out to my car I hurried to get in and lock the door because he had appeared from the side of the building and began banging on my car window. After I managed to reverse my car and leave he still followed right behind me on his bike.  While I do applaud King for being a very welcoming place to gather for people of all walks, including homeless people, there has to be more done when things like this happen. I'm sure something like this is a rarity, but it really only takes common sense to figure to do something, anything, to get rid of someone who is acting that way at your coffee shop. Will not be returning to King."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly baristas, classic chill, tiny coffee shop vibe. Thankfully, they value good cold brew in Arizona almost as much as I do.  Definitely my favorite near ASU."}
{"text":"This place is adorable... I love the little \"cubicles\" where you can work with a little extra privacy with something that cuts down the echo around you. The folks who work here are nice and friendly, and the tea was tasty too :)"}
{"text":"Cappuccinos, cold brews, and cookies- anything that starts with a C, King does really well. I mean, they probably do other stuff well too, but I thoroughly vetted the C items. Cappuccino was well balanced and the cold brew is super-smooth and has practically no acidity. Both pair well with a cookie, but the chocolate was the favorite, almost like a homemade Oreo. Watch out for the brownies though, they're vegan and made with black beans- as the barista put it, I'm not a fan but some people are really into that."}
{"text":"This quaint little coffee shop is pretty good. It's really small with just the right amount of tables inside, which is nice because it's impossible to get too crowded.  Latte was A-, Bagel A+, croissant B+ We also appreciated the super nice barista :)  All in all, this is a cool little artsy coffee shop to grab a quick pick-me-up. Not too crowded or trendy. Just right!"}
{"text":"King coffee is a small coffee shop. Their drinks are always very good and I've never had a complaint. They have good seating and a couple alcoves for studying/working."}
{"text":"Not only were the drinks amazing, the customer service is too great! The vibe of this place is relaxing. I love it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the place coffee latte in Tempe, Arielle makes it with so much love! they welcome me with a lot of warmth & were so enthusiastic about having new people on town & get to know me... It s a good day"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop that's tucked away in a corner off of Mill Ave. I appreciate the natural lighting, the African roobios tea is so yummy and I've tried one of their homemade Oreos which were bomb.   It's a great place to meet up with a few friends, read a book solo, or pull open your laptop and work away. Free wifi, outlets and plenty of good vibes."}
{"text":"Cozy little place. Super hard to find. But cute enough to make it worth driving in circles for 15 minutes around the neighborhoods LOL. I got the chai with coconut milk. The tables slide around a little bit too much for my liking, but if they add a few rugs we are golden"}
{"text":"As cliché as it sounds, King Coffee really is a diamond in the rough. Competing with a very nearby Cartel Coffee Lab, King is nestled away in a tiny little space against Mill Avenue, across from campus/Gammage. The parking situation was a little tricky at first, but I figured it out (pull in through front and go into back lot) and got inside to a cozy little spot sporting local art and mellow, yet smooth soundtrack (anyplace with Glass Animals playing when I walk in is a great thing). I've heard their cold-press \"Toddy\" is their staple, but I wanted to test my go-to, a hot Dirty Chai, and damn, I was not disappointed. A single barista is rockin' out behind the bar, but he's got it under control and whips up my chai tea in about two minutes. I can honestly say this is one of the best dirty chai's I've ever had; however, the best thing about this little java shop is the price. All the \"base options\" on the menu are under $5 for a large, even my large dirty chai plus $1 tip came out to $5 and change. I plan on getting their Toddy cold-press next time to test it out, and one thing is for sure.. King Coffee is where it's at. Definitely preferred over Cartel if I had to choose."}
{"text":"This coffee is very different from any other, the owner is very personable and very knowledgeable about making fantastic coffee creations. Try the Toddy if you get a chance, you probably won't find it anywhere else and is to die for."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend as he was passing through across the country, because it is a short walk from work at ASU.  We both ordered bacon egg burritos and they were bomb! A lot of food for a lunch and was very tasty.   He got a latte and he loved it.   I got a double shot of espresso and it was strong to kick my butt back in gear after lunch to get back to work.   I really like this place and it was a super plus because his dog was allowed to come in and sit with us inside to escape the heat!"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with the service, deliciousness and ambiance! And good prices, especially on pastries. Plus Everything is 20% off after 6pm which rocks! Loved the African rooibos and oatmeal cream pie. I can't believe I never heard of this place before. DEFINITELY coming back and referring friends."}
{"text":"Good relaxing place. It's new so it's a bit empty but it's a good think. And the coffee is great which is all that matters when it comes down to it! Next time I am on this side of town will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. I came here to kill time early in the morning and ended up staying through lunchtime. Great coffee, (endless cup for staying in) and they have workplace areas and wifi. The internet is reliable. Very cozy place to hang out and get work done. Also, they play great music! They have couches and chairs if you want to hang out with friends as well. Definitely would recommend for anyone who is wanting a classic coffee shop feel."}
{"text":"The chai latte is sooooo good and the coffee is really good too! Cool atmosphere. Not giving 5 stars because I got there at 11:30am and they said I couldn't have food because they were about to close but their posted hours everywhere say they close at 7."}
{"text":"Great locally owned coffee shop with the nicest baristas and affordable prices. I got an ice chai latte and it was delicious! It's also a perfect place to study since there are lots of tables and chairs."}
{"text":"Love it! Great view from the patio, awesome service, tasty scones. Coffee was perfect. The croissant was fresh and went well with the coffee."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this coffee shop and although I didn't get to spend a lot of time inside, the experience was memorable. I had the sweetest barista Ray take my order over the phone before I got there and she had all my coffee orders ready (all 5) by the time I got there. Ray was even willing to help me carry my drinks to my car and set the, in my front seat. What a darling! Ray you are amazing. Its people like this that keep me coming back. The co workers and myself loved the coffee! Much love from Endurance Builder brand!"}
{"text":"I frequently go to Zia on southern and I had passed by King Coffee a few times these past few weeks. I had been meaning to stop by and I finally made it in. I really enjoyed the simple decoration, and humble appearance . Unlike some coffee shops in the area, this one didn't give off a pretentious, local coffee shop vibe. The guy who helped me, which I can't entirely remember his name, I think it was josh, was super cool and friendly. Told me about their cold brew coffee and we chatted for awhile. The coffee was excellent. Went for an iced red eye. Definitely going back when I'm back in the area. I may even find myself going out of my way to pick up some coffee from King coffee."}
{"text":"Never had a drink I didn't like, and the baristas are great! So polite, friendly, and welcoming. I love stopping here on my way into school. I'd choose King Coffee over Starbucks any day"}
{"text":"That don't open early or stay open late, but they do make great coffee, tea and espresso drinks.  Bonus points for having a bike rack right out front and playing a nice mix of eclectic music.  Staff are super friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"First off, this coffee shop is in a great location near ASU. Walking distance from downtown Tempe and a short drive from work offices around the area.   They have a tiny parking lot which means it's easy to get in and out with a bicycle. You should probably bike anyways. Saves the planet and your bank account.   I will have to go back and try their other drinks. Their drip coffee is average. Oh free drip refills! They don't have decaf coffee but they do have tea options. Drink up!"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you need to do anything on the internet. I got a download speed of 6.38Mbps while here. Someone else told me that the Wi-Fi is always like this."}
{"text":"Best coffee and baristas in Tempe! I'm so happy they were able to expand and (hopefully!) get the attention and business they deserve. I've never been disappointed with the service or product and I get my fix 5/7 days out of the week. The cold brew is just the right kind of jet fuel I need to get through the work day. If you're sick of the overpriced and fluffy corporate drinks at Starbucks and have social anxiety just thinking about Dutch Brothers, I highly recommend King Coffee as your local coffee go-to."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT! This place is adorable! The cold brew is GREAT! And the Chai is the best around! Super rich and flavorful. They are quick and the staff is super friendly and helpful! They are my new favorite coffee place in Tempe. I will visit them EVERY TRIP down here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best of local.  There's a lot of heart going to to this coffee and it shows.  Notice how many reviews gave top rating!  I'm from Seattle, so a bit fussy about quality.  If King's was in Seattle, that's where I would go.  Great folks and great coffee."}
{"text":"I don't get the reviews. We live locally. Went twice. Both times, same guy behind the counter. Rude, condescending, crappy coffee and food. Done!"}
{"text":"It was great. Nice, easy and close to ASU and downtown.   Just watch for the sign on Mill or you'll miss it.  Parking is fr"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service with awesome recommendations. Fair prices. Solid tea selection. I had the iced mint green tea based on what the server said and it was great. Chill atmosphere to study. Everything you need in a coffee shop"}
{"text":"This place is quite adorable and it's obviously a favorite of the ASU crowd because almost every table and chair were filled with studying students.  There is plenty of parking in the parking lot in the back if the one non-handicapped spot in the front is filled.  I had a delicious iced pumpkin latte and my hubby loved his cold brew coffee.  It was more flavorful and roasty than other cold brews he's had. They have a punch card too, so get your punches with every cup!  The pastries look really good so bring your will power if you're on a diet!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place three times now, and I have to say the service and experience have been exceptional every time.  The barista, Josh, is always happy to exchange pleasantries or engage in deeper subject matter - the last time I was in line, I noticed he had been able to extract the previous patron's area of professional interest and started a conversation . . . it's nice to see that sense of connectedness between a business and the surrounding community because it's become so rare these days.  Also, Josh (the only barista I've encountered there) was there to only lightly toast my bagel since I was 'in a hurry' and needed to get to a meeting - these people actually care about you.  Last thing - I've encountered some other (seemingly) frequenters to this establishment and they seem like great people.  I look forward to playing some chess with them just as soon as I can come up for some air from the school/work combo.  This place deserves to do well!  Definitely choose to drop in and say hi when you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place was a really nice place gave me nice service and lots and lots of coffee idk tho if it would say up latwr at nigght it would be nicer"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was looking for a local coffee shop in the Tempe area on a Sunday and decided to give King Coffee a try based off of the great Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed. I was greeted by Arielle, one of the owners, who was super genuine, friendly, and the love she had for her business was incredible! Not to mention, the coffee itself was pretty great. It's in a super quaint, but charming location. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like their latte a lot. I have been coming here a lot.  The beans they use seem to have some sour flavor to it and it blends well with the milk which makes the perfect latte. They have great wifi and seating spaces.. often full."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I highly recommend trying the iced coffee during the hot summer months."}
{"text":"CUTE little local shop! Excited to hear they'll be expanding in July & can't wait to see the updated look. The cold brew was excellent (very smooth & almost chocolaty) & the barista was very friendly. It was our first time in so we didn't realize they had food, but I'll definitely try their veggie sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Best coffee ever. the Dirty Matcha is a phenomenal drink, try it. Staff is super friendly, and the ambiance is great for doing homework. I will be back there every time that I need coffee on ASU's campus"}
{"text":"Awesome little coffees shop across from ASU. The baristas smiled and were pleasant to deal with. It was my first time trying a cold brew despite seeing them everywhere and it was very good. The prices are reasonable for their mostly student clientele and they also had some water put out as well. I'm happy I stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with King's Coffee. I have never had a bad experience here. I ordered a bagel today and it was perfectly toasted: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I have gotten cold brew coffee in the past and it is perfection.   Can't wait to come back to try the Affogatto after reading about it in the Phoenix New Times. Espresso + Ice cream is my loose definition of heaven."}
{"text":"My go-to as it is a quick walk from campus. I've tried both the iced toddy and hot latte; both were fantastic. The toddy is super refreshing and not at all bitter. The microfoam in my latte was velvety smooth.   Friendly and welcoming baristas. Even got a free cupcake on my last visit."}
{"text":"I like trying different coffee shops each week and Kings so far is one of my favs. I go there a few times a week. I love their chai tea latte. Top 2 in my book. I love how they throw cinnamon on top of it. I also love the vibe. Employees are really nice for the most part. You guys should definitely check them out. Fav coffee shop in Tempe so far."}
{"text":"Literally the best Latte I have ever had. If you are an ASU school of music student, this is your Graceland."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Probably the best espresso I've had in Tempe. Their remodel is fantastic. Great place to sit and study or work. People are super-friendly and *bonus* the music they play is good!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good, minus a few weird pieces of art. Hopefully they rotate what paintings go on the walls. It is small but never terribly busy so the small tables are perfect for intimate conversation or solo study time. The coffee is simply great and they have a variety of syrups to add. \"For here\" orders come in clear mason jars. Very cute."}
{"text":"Just went here a few minutes ago. As I posted in some other reviews, I've been trying out all the different little private roasters and coffee places around Tempe, Mesa. Lots of great places, lots of good coffee.  I primarily rate based on the product  and not so much the atmosphere. So I'm giving this four because I seldom give a five on the first visit. I like to have some room to go up or down for follow up visits.   This place is tiny and quiet. Coffee was excellent. I had a cappuccino, my go to for first time cuppa coffee at a place like this to see if they can make a coffee. It was very good.  They had a simple selection of baked goods, coffee cake, bagels, cheesecake. I had their apple walnut pecan coffee cake. Delicious.  I'm not really familiar with cold brew coffee, so I asked him about it, and they gave me a sample.  Staff was very friendly, very inviting place, very quiet, lots of people studying.  I love these kind a holes in the wall places. I like them over the more contemporary Starbucks and similar places like that. I would definitely come back on my continual tour of small coffee shops.  Nice job guys."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, fair prices, lots of study space, and a punch card. This is my new go-to!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cup of fresh and wasn't disappointed. Coffee was really good and the place was comfortable. The decor/location isn't really anything to write home about but why should it be, it is a coffee shop and it makes a good cup.  Worth a shot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Super nice, locally owned coffee shop with a great vibe. I had a cappuccino and it was excellent! Parking is limited, but I rode my bike and there is plenty of bike parking. Staff were welcoming."}
{"text":"Small, simple, and perfect are the three words that come to mind.   King coffee (originally Three Roots) was a cool spot a few years ago, but since their expansion they have become my go-to when I'm down at ASU (which would still be the case even if they weren't in close proximity to COOR where I'm at 90% of the time).   They have unusually great study space, a lounge area, consistent wifi, local art on the walls, and a sturdy little food menu (sandwich, bagels, & pastries- including some vegan) to go with their coffee.   Also, they are walking distance from Chipotle- I frequently get a burrito bowl to-go and eat at King over a cappuccino, iced tea or my guilty pleasure: Italian soda sans cream (because they have more flavors than most coffee shops [other than Starbucks] carry in the area), then delve into a study marathon at one of their large tables or intimate walled booths.   Haven't tried their pastries but that's merely because of constrained effort- they look divine. I believe there's some good cold case grab-and-go options as well if you're running to class.  Local, independently family-owned. Consistently friendly and competent service- they have a cute about page on their baristas (http://kingcoffeeaz.com/about/)  Ambiance is casual, but undoubtedly third wave.   I have no complaints, and not enough great things to say."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! It's where I go to get my work done. It's normally pretty quiet, and I'm always feeling the music they play. I'm on my way to getting a free shirt...(apparently if you get 10(?) punch cards completed, then you receive a free King Coffee shirt).  If you stay there for a while, you can get free refills on coffee or hot water for tea. The coffee they use is brighter and more fruity than what you might be used to (something I've noticed). I either get the drip coffee [$2 for reg/ $2.5 for large] or earl grey lavender tea.  They have two desks in the back that are really nice if you want to focus and study because they're cut-outs in the wall, so you're pretty secluded. There are about 9-10 spots for parking in the back! And if you're an ASU student, it's right across the street from Gammage.  Alsoo~~ this is important - they've changed the hours a couple times since I started going there two years ago, so you should follow their Facebook page to get updates!"}
{"text":"Solid spot in Tempe basically across from the Coor building parking area at ASU. They have one spot in the front and some more parking the back. Definitely a student area as most people are diving into their laptops or books."}
{"text":"Any establishment with \"coffee\" in the name should be able to make a decent cappuccino.  Taupe colored milk doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Great place to study and their coffee selections are delicious! I recommend you to visit this place"}
{"text":"I went into King coffee expecting to like it. I was excited to try a new coffee shop in Phoenix. Further, I had heard they use Cortez coffee roasters (same as Songbird and various other places), so I figured it would be good. The coffee shop itself is cute and small with parking in the back. The barista was very friendly. The coffee was.... just ok. I got a latte and it didn't have the same flavor as other lattes I have had made with Cortez coffee. Maybe it was a different roast or maybe the difference was in the skill of the barista, but it was just mediocre. Anyway, I would try them again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great coffee and an even better vibe. Everybody is super friendly and Ariel is just amazing. Normally I'm an Americano guy but my genius son told me to get the Toddy. Wow. That's my jam now. Ask Josh to play a game of chess if you have the opportunity. He's really good."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in their coffee after hearing people rave about it. It wasn't anything special, but I would give it another shot. The building smelled a little funky too."}
{"text":"I was waiting for this spot to open up since I'm right across the street for art class! I ordered an iced mocha latte and it was great! The mocha latte satisfied my chocolate craving, they use  Ghirardelli chocolates and Carmel sauce! So yummy! They had some great soft pop music playing and a small indoor seating area. They also have pastries and toddys!   If they ever are looking for local artists to fill in their wall space I hope I'm able to get some of my work up their to fill those bare walls. :) amberzart dot com"}
