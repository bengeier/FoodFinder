{"text":"Fantastically delicious tacos. Simple yet fresh and savory. Need about 4 to be satisfied. Also they had a very friendly staff. So happy to find this place"}
{"text":"Great street tacos!!!! this is not a fancy restaurant prepare yourself,  actually its a lunch truck where yummy goodness comes from. This is just good simple food. I have had the tripas tacos and they are fantastic, cooked to order. Carne asada  is always good as well for those not so adventurous."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican tacos. I frequently come here and have never been disappointed. I've had him cater some of our birthday parties and baby showers and it was a complete hit with everyone! I highly recommend Waldo's Tacos!"}
{"text":"The tacos were a big disappointment All tortilla and no filling. No sauce and no extras on there. Better off with the burrito. I like the cameron. Crispy fried shrimp with beans and rice 

I got here at 550 one night because they open at 6.  NEVER doing that again. They didn't show until 620 then they waiting too long to get orders and started setting tables up instead. They let some regular get his burrito before me.  I don't get mine until 650.  One hour for a burrito or not worth it.  I'll probably never go back after that experience"}
{"text":"Damn! This taco truck is the bomb! Came for the first time with my wife and we wanted to try everything on their menu. So good! Spreading the word."}
{"text":"Amazing Food Truck, they don't need a restaurant, they already have one where the lines are long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Waldo's taco truck is conveniently located and has late night hours which is nice. They were very helpful and spoke English as well. We ordered Asada tacos, a quesadilla and a carne Asada burrito. They tasted great and were packaged up nice since we got them to go. They also had a selection of soda and beer as well to choose from."}
{"text":"Growing up in Los Angeles it was always nice to walk around the corner and get tacos pastor on a rotating spit. I have not been able to experience that since living in Arizona, however Waldos Tacos brought those memories back of my favorite tacos today. Although it was not on a rotating spit the pastor was tender and very tasty,  I also tried tripas tacos that was amazing as well the sauce was just the right condiment for these tacos. This is my spot as long as I'm in AZ now."}
{"text":"I lived in Norwalk CA and I've ate plenty of Taco Truck tacos and with that being said this is hands down the best tacos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious very happy and will be returning for sure. Be sure to try all varieties of the tacos."}
{"text":"Super mad because they close before their original closing time I got their at 11 and their truck was not even there 
Get you buisness together!!"}
{"text":"This is real mexican street food experince non of that taco bell fake corporate crap.Here you get the authentic tacos , burritos, quesadillas ,and flan. Its bomb place to come and eat very cheap and delicious.I recommend trying all the tacos just to see witch is your favorite.I will continue to come here"}
{"text":"Can't get enough my boyfriend and I eat here on a weekly basis !!! Tacos are good and tortas are even better! Live right across where they park their taco truck and we can't resist. I love their green salsa too I literally drink that stuff. My boyfriend would eat here everyday if I let him."}
{"text":"Great service, just okay tacos. I came here twice and the food it's just to bland for my palate. What is it with Arizona taco spots, they have water down SALSAS just Gross. I want salsa with a lot of tomato and chile, not water and tomato V8 juice! Can you change your salsa recipe? I'll give you one more try, I'd like to try out the Suadero tacos, but if they're not good, I'm done... Good try though. 

I miss Cali taco spots!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite late-night taco trucks love coming here after work for some great cheap carne asada tacos quesadilla carne asada pretty flavor and the meat is pretty lean because sometimes those other places you get the fatty Gristle no bueno but what makes tears is there salsa I like the green one the best on the spicy side but not too all the people there are super friendly I know it must be a great place when you see the Popo there so if you're around there stop by and grab some tacos won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Love this taco stand! Pretty good price for decent size tacos. Full tacos with authentic Mexican taste, I also like how you don't have to wait too long for the food. Great place if you're looking for great authentic taste. Plus, the staff is super friendly and clean area to enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"These tacos were horrible. I tried them after being recommended them by a friend. I am a taco enthusiast. These tacos made me gag and borderline throw them up. Would never return."}
{"text":"Just called to find out if they were still open. Their yelp page says they're open till midnight but a review says 11pm. So I call at 10:58pm and a guy tells me that they're still open so I ask till when and he says \"we close at 11pm\". I understand people get busy at restaurants but come on! I needed tacos but didn't want nasty taco bell this late. Still haven't experienced the food yet so I'll just give 3 stars then adjust the review accordingly"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! We got the carne asada and chicken tacos. The green salsa is amazing! Quick service too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Waldo's Tacos is a Mexican food wagon vender. On the corner of Grand and 91st Ave.  Open 6 pm to 11 p.m.  Tues thru Saturday

They serve a variety of tacos, tortas and burritos.
You may order rice and or beans on the side.
The tacos are small and soft. Cilantro and onion are added as a filler.
I tried three different tacos......... tripas, (milk ducts) which were made to perfection.  Asada ( grilled beef) which was ok and Lengua ( beef tongue) which was tender and tasty.
My husband had a pork burrito, that was huge, it had rice and beans in it.
It was very good.  The service is fast, the food is hot.
The red homemade salsa in a bottle was the best I have ever had.   Mexican coke and Jarritos in different flavors are also sold.
They have three tables set up there for you to sit and visit with other patrons. Or have your food to go."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Priced well. So happy that they stay open until midnight! I work nights at the hospital so its really nice on the weekends when our cafe closed at 7pm :/."}
{"text":"Worse street tacos I think I've had. I have been to pretty much every taco place I phoenix and this place was not good at all.  Go to tacos Tijuana not far away and get real tacos."}
{"text":"***Gasp*** OMGoodness! I've died and gone to taco heaven! Let me just say that this was absolutely the first time ever in my life eating food out of a food truck, and clearly I've been missing out! My mom thought I was crazy when I gave her directions to Waldo's Tacos, and then told her \"turn into this parking lot, quick!\" When she asked me where Waldo's Tacos was, I pointed out the truck when the \"open\" sign flashing in the window, and her exact words were \"you've got to be kidding me\"... well no, I wasn't. 

We went up to the truck, and although my Spanglish is pretty good, I didn't really know what to order. Lucky for my mom and I, there was someone there taking orders who spoke English (phew!) He saw the \"deer-caught-in-headlights\" look on my mom and my face so he walked us through the menu. I ended up ordering 2 shrimp tacos, 2 chicken tacos, 2 steak tacos (yes, that was just for me), and my mom ordered a chicken burrito. The food came out fairly quickly, and I barely made it to the car without opening the box... Ya, my tacos didn't make it very far before I devoured them. Since eating here, I've been ranting and raving and craving more... but it's sooo far away from me! :(

Waldo's Tacos... since you're mobile, can you drive to the northeast side of the valley, please?"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the obligatory Cinco de Mayo taco. The truck was nice and clean and staff was super friendly. They set up outdoor seating so you can eat as son as you get your tacos. They are VERY reasonably priced too. Between my friends and I, we ordered 9 tacos and 3 drinks for $18. I tried the carne asada and al pastor. Both were nicely seasoned though the meat was a little dry. The red sauce is crazy spicy so use at your own risk. It was too much for me but they also provide a milder green sauce which still had a good burn to it. For a drink, I recommend the hibiscus agua fresca!"}
{"text":"The hole in the wall. Inexpensive and very good. It's hard to find authentic food in Arizona and this place hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Yayyyyy!!! 
Awesome legit taste like heaven taco truck!!!
The cashier was really nice! I asked him what Cameron was and he offered a piece to try. I thought that was really nice :)

Anyway, the food was good, the sauce was good, atmosphere was good. We were the happy campers :)"}
{"text":"Tacos were decent. Quick & ready to go. If you're in a hurry I'd recommend this spot. But if you have time to travel, I'd suggest a few other local spots that are more satisfying than this truck. Not saying it's bad at all. It is decent. Just not my first stop to go to"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Waldo's tacos. This isn't just any \"another food truck\" meal, this a great spot for tacos & burritos. They have really good carne asada tacos and a good tripas burrito (I'm like the only person that orders it). But they really do hold it down for the west side! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite food truck in the valley. Amazing service and the red sauce is indescribable... So flavorful! Price is very reasonable. I normally go by there on Fridays at 91st and grand."}
{"text":"One of the best taco trucks in Arizona!! I love the carne asada tacos and the carne asada quesadilla. The staff is really nice, and they have a nice seating area. Only thing I would complain about is the hours.. Lol it says they are open until 12am but I've gone several times around 11 and they were gone.. But other than that it's great!!"}
{"text":"Best burritos and tacos in the area! My GF and I love coming here, and getting some good local street tacos."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic place in the westside. Great tacos, tortas, and burritos. We've had the camaron, pastor, asada,and chorizo. All delicious. There are 6 folding tables available and, of course, you can take them home. Check the hours before you go. Showing up when they are not there can be a real bummer."}
{"text":"Great taqueria!  Great service!  Great price!  AMAZING salsa! delicious chorizo!  Just wish they had Guac.  They never get mad at us from bringing our own though :)"}
{"text":"Great little street taco shack which is exactly what I was looking for while in town on vacation. We had the pollo and chorizo tacos and my only mistake was I only ordered ten tacos for two of us. I could have easily ate many more. Thankfully we had other food with us since we were going for a smorgasbord type meal. Would go back and the best tacos we had while visiting the southwest."}
{"text":"For a Taco Truck, 5 stars! If you like upscale fine dining Mexican sit down restaurants, and have never had authentic Mexican Food, you may not like this place; but if you enjoy authentic Mexican tacos, quesadillas and tortas, this place is for you. Their Carne Asada quesadillas are amazing along with the salsa verde and red salsa. You also know they're legit when they serve up roasted jalapeños and have fresh limes to squeeze on your food. Delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a Dodgers spring training game & it totally hit the spot! Felt like I was eating street tacos back in LA!"}
{"text":"Love this taco truck. No complaints excellent service foods great. Don't let the area throw you off. Will definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Everything tastes delicious here, especially lengua and Suadero tacos. Cheap and quick service. Too bad that they only open at night."}
{"text":"This little food truck is an amazing place. So glad my Aunt told me about this place on a recent visit home. So reasonable and the food was fantastic. I highly recommend the Shrimp quesadilla. It was the best I've ever had. We tried a little of everything and for 40.00 dollar we had more food than four people could eat. FYI make sure when they ask if you want everything on it you ask what that is. They were going to put lettuce on it but that wasn't like what I was used to so I kept it off."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying out these tacos. And, they're mediocre to say the least. I mean, if you're hungry and craving tacos desperately, then I guess this place might work. I'd probably never come back here again. I gave them 3 stars for the effort but it's a failure in my book. There's plenty of other good options in Phoenix. I won't promote other companies, but you should do some more searching."}
{"text":"We just moved back to town a few weeks ago and we were over at a buddies house drinking beer, shooting the shit and we all started craving mexican taco's. Our boy said let's go get some from the taco truck down the street! Man this place has bomb ass taco's! Their shrimp taco's are to die for!!! And their red sauce is something serious when it comes to spicy...but boy is it good! I absolutely love this place and plan on making the drive out to them soon for more taco's. 100% worth the trip and check out!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! True authentic Mexican street tacos the carne asada burrito is the best ever! Very friendly and clean the owner is the best cook ever! Not greasy or dry meat. Very simple food but Delicious. $15 will feed 4 Love it!!! Takes you back to Mexico!"}
{"text":"I had no idea they had a yelp or I would have reviewed forever ago. My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE place for tacos. They are so fresh & I love the vibe. I love coming out to a taco truck (we have them back home) and eating food. I have NEVER found another as delicious as Waldo's."}
{"text":"I live in Portland, a food heaven of sorts. So I had low expectations for taco trucks when visiting my parents in Sun City. But... this place is awesome. (I even tried the brain and the tongue.)"}
{"text":"I can never say no to tacos. My friend brought me here the other night and I've been dying to try it out since she says only good things about it every time we pass by. 

I wasn't that hungry but I ordered two tacos anyways. I decided on their carne asada tacos and she ordered the cheese quesadilla with carne asada. 

The carne asada meat was flavored very well and had an excellent taste to it. I had everything on it which was onions and cilantro. 

However, I was not a fan of their red or green sauce. Usually the green sauces are the milder ones but they were both spicy for me. I'm so used to having hot sauce/salsa on my tacos that I had to have some on my tacos but the hotness was overbearing. The sauce itself also lacked flavor. All I tasted from it was spiciness. 

Other than the sauce, the tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Has Waldo's tacos moved? I came on Tuesday during business hours according to yelp and they aren't here...  I really want some Waldo's tacos..."}
{"text":"I've been to this truck about 12 times now and it's always good! Great tasting tacos at a great price. I haven't had anything else from the menu other than the tacos. I'm sure everything will be delicious. I'm in the food industry and I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cmon guys I come here all the time. Tacos are alway in point always. But your cucumbers were slimy today and your radishes rubbery your limes were dried out. Please fix this you guys are the best don't slip."}
{"text":"Waldo's tacos is cheap - I'll give them that. But I guess after reading some of these Yelp reviews, I expected a bit more.

We ordered a few carne asada tacos, as well as a single pastor. Meat flavor was just okay. Not really any different than what you'd find at any standard, run-of-the-mill obscure taco joint. We also ordered a cheese quesadilla, which I felt tasted like burnt cheese. My girlfriend felt the tortillas had that \"preservative\" taste to them, so I'm guessing they don't opt for homemade-style at this particular truck. 

The area itself is a bit sketchy after sundown. Personally, I feel that there's a truck a few miles North of here on Thunderbird that does their tacos a bit better, but that's only my opinion. 

Bottom line: It's cheap eating - and there ain't nothing wrong with that. A lot of people like them, but in terms of competing options, I doubt Waldo's would be my first choice."}
{"text":"Really yummy. I cannot believe how good it is for how cheap it is.  Love the street tacos!  Really fast service and the food is hot and fresh.  Fan on the patio so a hot summer night is still doable.  I have been driving by for the last two years and just realized I have wasted two years not stopping."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco spot in AZ! They have outstanding tacos! Highly recommend! Another thing is the customer service and location are superb! The tacos come out quick and the people are so nice."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Cali, and I kept searching for a decent taco spot. Finally found what I was looking for! This place is the TRUTH foreal! BEST TACOS OUT THERE"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food truck!  The owners specially made us a vegetable quesadilla (not on the menu).  It was delicious and definitely hit the spot.  The two sauces are also really good.   The green was super flavorful but not tart or sour!  The red sauce was pretty spicy.  Definitely will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Saw this on yelp and had to try it. Went about 9:30 pm on Thursday night. It is on the SW corner of 91st and Grand Ave. There were several families at the tables. My order was taken by a very nice man who explained they didn't have any cheek or brisket. I got a long taco, an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco. They put cilantro and onion on the taco. I got it to go and they gave me 2 small containers- 1 green salsa 1 red salsa. Also picked up some limes from the truck. These tacos are the bomb. Some of the best street tacos I have ever had. Didn't use the red salsa but the green was excellent. The lingua was moist and tender and the al pastor is some of the best I've ever eaten. If you are hankering for some great mexican food on the west side and it is between 6pm and 12am tuesday thru sat  go to Waldo's taco truck!"}
{"text":"Outstanding tacos de lengua, tripas, asada and al pastor.  The was a little bit of a wait but that's because people keep coming! You can order to go, or call your order to pick up.  There are a few tables to sit if you can find a seat."}
{"text":"The value here it's incredible. $11 for 5 tacos and two drinks is unreal. Good tacos and horchata. Let's be real though you need to find here with friends. It's all about spending some good times with good friends and enjoying good food. Definitely worth the price and the salsa Verde is so good!"}
{"text":"Not just another food truck, this is a Mexican restaurant on wheels! Judge this truck by its looks and you'll be sorry! A first for my family and we were absolutely pleased! Carneasada tacos, burritos, and quesadilla were !! Make a pit stop off of Grand Ave. and treat yourself!"}
{"text":"I find it hard getting a truck five stars but this place is absolutely worth it! Genuine, authentic Mexican tacos"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! This is real Mexican street food. Love it. I only wished they were opened later. Maybe till 2-3am. Affordable and tasty!!! For a lunch truck :) Latino family putting in work!!!"}
{"text":"These tacos are grrrrrrreat! One of the few places that does tripa tacos and does not ruin them by undercooking them or by frying them to within an inch of their lives. I really enjoy eating here and taking away tacos to eat at home. They taste just as good an hour later when I get home and stick them in my microwave. Love Waldo tacos!"}
{"text":"If street tacos are your thing, then Waldo's is for you.  Authentic preparation, friendly staff.  

Don't be early though if you are looking for it and its your first time, as the food truck pulls up right at 6:00.  We drove around a bit until we saw the truck down the street, and then we followed it to the parking lot.  

No alcohol, so if you like your tacos with a cold cerveza you will need to bring your own"}
{"text":"We have been driving past this corner for years and finally stopped last night to give it a try.  My only regret is that we haven't done it sooner.  Tortas, street tacos, and burros with your choice of meats including tripas, cabeza, asada, lengua, and many more.

The food is authentic, the truck is clean, and the people are friendly.  What more could you ask for?  One more thing I guess......great value!   My wife and I each had a delicious torta, my daughter had a quesadilla, and we each had 2 tacos for $18 which is less than we would spend at a fast food place.

They set up each day around 6pm, so if you are in the area Waldo's is a place you must stop and try."}
{"text":"AMAZING Street Tacos for $1.50? Sign me up! We Love the tacos these guys make, and they are always very friendly also. The Carne Asada is to die for! It's moist and full of flavor, unlike others in the valley who try to make it. We tell everyone about this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The tacos are amazing, and the service is great. This won't be our last visit. Luckily enough it's less than a mile from our house. It's a little hidden treasure that come out at night and should not be missed."}
{"text":"Went to this exact location listed at 11 and it was no where to be seen. If you're listed open till 12 then you should stay there."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best street tacos around. I will be back and recommend to my taco loving friends"}
{"text":"Amazing..... The only downfall is I forget and swing by on Mondays. Dang it, closed. When it's this good, you wish it was open 24/7."}
{"text":"Love these tacos! We frequent this truck often and always fill up on Carne Asada tacos! Great prices and service! Love their green salsa but beware...it varies between mild some days and super hot other days. Try it before pouring on your tacos. Definitely stop by and try them out!"}
{"text":"Freakin Delish! The staff is all super nice and the tacos were savory. Im picky with tacos because some places have super fatty pieces of meat that are extra chewy, but Waldo's tacos have finely diced meat and I definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos de lengua! Not fancy looking but you know those are the best places. Fast service."}
