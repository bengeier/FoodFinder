{"text":"Sooo yummy and awesome prices. I've never had anything bad here and service is excellent. I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I usually just come here because the sushi is cheap . I had tried the chicken with garlic sauce and it was surprisingly great . I've been here before and usually the service is really horrible . This time around it was decent . Just horrible service , HORRIBLE ."}
{"text":"My family and I have really enjoy Chinese food and W&K is one of the best in the fort mill / carowinds area. Is everything perfect? No, but the chicken or shrimp with broccoli (a standard in any Chinese restaurant) has a phenomenal sauce and I cannot recommend their shrimp dishes enough - their shrimp are massive and there are always a ton in every order).   My parents enjoy shrimp Kung pao (no water chestnuts or baby corn - they do add or remove ingredients as you desire!) and the shrimp with broccoli with cashews. I prefer the shrimp and chicken with broccoli because each has a delicious sauce and when combined are fantastic (and add cashews). The sushi is also very fresh and delicious, made by the sushi chef to order. It is also inexpensive at dinner (half off) and worth grabbing if you like sushi!   I have never gotten a delivery and cannot review that service, but we are regulars and know the staff by name and vice versa, we are always treated very well."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars only because the food is decent (most of the time).  The service, however, is HORRIBLE. Several times myself or my husband has gone in to pick up a takeout order, and the guy with the ponytail takes payment but does not retrieve the food. Then another guy, when you inquire about if your food is ready, asks for payment for your order, which is just sitting there, getting cold. Ridiculous.  Also, it's a bit grimy in there. I do not like seeing dead bugs in front of the door."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Never had a bad meal. Seasame chicken is not too sweet, egg rolls, yum!! Lots of food for the price."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. The wait and host staff are always eager to accommodate. Their sushi is refreshing as well as their hot and sour soup. Their steamed pork dumplings are the perfect consistency and flavor.   Anytime my wife and I feel like sushi this is our first in mind. Not only is it not overpriced like your typical place in the area, but it is exceptional. I will visit this place as long as they're open."}
{"text":"Visiting. The delivery driver was nice, great timing and the food seemed like it had just been cooked. The issue is NO flavor!!!! There was absolutely no flavor to our shrimp lo mein. I expect Chinese food to taste like Chinese food. The lo mein was bland and nasty. Very disappointed!!!! The egg rolls were overcooked and also bland. The bourbon chicken was good."}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan. Service was not up to par and took an unusually long time."}
{"text":"Their sushi is delicious.  I love the dumplings too.  The entrees and fried rice are average."}
{"text":"I ordered take out here last night. Two items. Chicken and Shrimp with Broccoli and Empire Sushi Roll. The portion size of the Chicken and Shrimp with Broccoli was very decent. Half the togo box was rice and the other half was the sauteed dish, with a spring roll on the side. There's something very distinct about this restaurant's sauce. I couldn't quite figure it out at first, but then I realized what i was. The sauce is not your typical brown sauce that restaurants use at other Chinese Restaurants. It had a red hue to it.  As I ate, I realized that the distinct taste was ketchup. This was a ketchup based brown sauce, and it tasted pretty good. I also counted 5 pieces of jumbo shrimp. For the price, this was very good value. I would give this Chinese dish 4 stars. The Empire Sushi Roll on the other hand, was a huge disappointment. It's supposed to have spicy tuna on the top, and salmon in the middle. The tuna part tasted like mush. It was rather disgusting. After the first one, I didn't know how I was going to finish the other 7. However, realizing I've paid $8.95 for this roll, I didn't want to waste any of it. I tried and tried, and finally chowed down 3 more pieces, before throwing the rest away. If this was purely a Chinese Restaurant, I would give them 4 stars. Because their sushi was so horrible, I have to give them a 2 star. Stick to your strong suit, Wang and King!!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular of this restaurant for almost 10 years. The quality has gone down since I was in high school, but it is still one of my favorite places to get American Chinese staples for an affordable price. The portion sizes are filling and the hot food is always fresh. The sushi is good for the price but not anywhere near the best in Charlotte which is reasonable considering the affordability. The manager is always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food !    I love this restaurant. They have awesome lunch specials. The food is awesome as we'll."}
{"text":"Wang & King was okay, just okay, which was kind of a bummer.  Now, we did not eat sushi, so maybe that is the draw at Wang & King.  There were several people around us with sushi.  The menu does have some interesting choices, with sushi, chinese and thai dishes.  I ordered a thai dish, which I was a little nervous about since I figured that probably wasn't their speciality.  It turned out okay.  It was tasty and generously sized (enough for two meals) but nothing I will crave or make a point to go back for.  Hubby chose the combo option with soup, rice and main dish.  The price was really fair (around $8.00 believe), but the portions were pretty skimpy.     Our food took a long time and they were not that busy.  Not sure if it was what I ordered or if this is typical.  The service in general was sufficient, not surly or rude, but our drinks did sit empty a little too long and no one was overly friendly.  All in all, I am sure there are better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"$2.75 for pretty much any sushi roll on the weekends and they are quite good.   I don't know what else to say... I'm a fan.  The atmosphere isn't much to be desired but if you're going here - its about the cheap sushi and I'll say that it is both cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"W & K is my go-to place for Chinese.  Great chow at a cheap price.  The sushi is very good, and inexpensive.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"If you're thinking 'I want Asian food but I'm a little far out, let me give this place a try' - don't."}
{"text":"Worst pretense of Chinese food I've ever tasted.  Tasted,  because my wife and I could not finish any of it.  I had mango  chicken. The chicken was incompletely cooked and there were a few snow pea pods,  pieces of cabbage,  and firm,  tasteless mango.   She had sesame chicken.  Tasteles and  overcooked,   Our miso soup was generous in quantity but had almost no detectable miso. The spring rolls seemed soggy not fresh as if they had been microwaved not cooked fresh.     We found it to be awful.  The common theme is: tasteless."}
{"text":"Better than you would think based on location and decor. Got a late night bite on Christmas day. Sushi was cheap, fresh, fast and good. Going back today."}
{"text":"We ordered from here because of the reviews, but I'm so sorry we did. Delivery took over an hour, the mango chicken had ZERO flavor, and it had a weird slimey texture. It couldn't be helped with several packets of duck sauce. My son liked his sesame chicken,  and my husband's steamed chicken was just ok. It's a one and done for us."}
{"text":"This is a solid place to go to if you need a casual asian dining place to go to. Sushi is very good with great presentation. Hawiian fried rice is my favorite, large portion cheap price"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. The quality is consistently good, particularly for the price. My main criticism is the wait staff. For some reason, they are incapable of keeping good staff on hand. Sometimes this causes a longer wait time, but you simply can't beat the price. Try the sushi sandwich as an appetizer."}
{"text":"So far this is probably one of the better asian places in my area. I have not been impressed with the competition thus far and I was pleasantly surprised the other day when we got take out from Wang and King. We ordered the orange chicken and a seafood stir fry. The orange chicken had large pieces of chicken and the orange sauce seemed to be made from scratch. The seafood dish actually had better seafood in it then the seafood I have received at fine dining restaurants in the area. It came with a good sized lobster tail, large shrimp, and scallops. The only thing I was no crazy about with the seafood dish is they put in imitation crab meat. Imitation crabmeat does not belong in a dish with all that other great seafood. I am looking forward to trying a few other things on there menu. They have a few thai cuisines on their menu as well they I am going to try soon."}
{"text":"We found Wang and King Asian Cafe by mistake but it was such a good find!   They have Chinese and Sushi, including weekend sushi specials which include buy one get one free and rolls $3.00 and under it's worth it! The atmosphere is nothing special but hey....we're there to eat so what really matters was how did the food taste!!!  And the food was super yummy! We ordered the Chicken Fried Rice which was full of flavor and chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and it came out hot!  We also ordered two rolls the Fairy Roll and the Crab Tempura Roll. Both were delicious! The Fairy Roll is yellowtail, salmon, tuna and a special sauce then it gets  deep fried!!!! So delicious! The special sauce adds a nice kick to the roll and is full of flavor! Very nice additional to the roll! The crab tempura roll was also very good. I've never had crab tempura but I really enjoyed the way they cooked it and created the roll! I wish they would have put some of the special sauce of the roll but still this roll tasted great.  Overall this was a very good place to stumble upon and I look forward to not only trying more of the sushi but also the Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for the first time. The sesame chicken and fried rice weren't good compared to Fortune Cookie II. The sushi on the other hand was delicious! I had the tempura crab roll. I'll definitely be going back for the sushi but not for anything else."}
{"text":"So? Looking for a quick average sushi fix... Great place!  Looking for very friendly service for take out? Sitting at the bar waiting for it, the chef and the head customer service young lady Wendy, were well....perfect!   Just what I needed, some cute quick fun!  I will be back. Maybe just for them.  No but really the food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend ordering take out/delivery from Wang & King. It took an hour and twenty minutes for my food to get delivered and when it did arrive my order was wrong. I had ordered shrimp fried rice, two sushi rolls, and cream cheese rangoons. When it arrived the shrimp fried rice was barely lukewarm, the sushi container felt room temp, and instead of the rangoons I got a box of half hard/half mushy noodles. I can't speak to the quality of the food, as we immediately went to Wang & King, food in hand, requesting a full refund. To the managers credit, he was very apologetic and refunded the full price without question. However, when we arrived there was at least 4 or 5 takeout bags just sitting on a table, who knows for how long. After we received out refund, the manager gave us the chance to take the food home, but sushi is not supposed to be warm, so we declined.   I've been coming to Wang & King for years and I am sad to say this restaurant has steadily gone downhill on our past few visits. Despite being consistently empty, the service is always incredibly slow. The last time I went, we waited over 40 minutes for our sushi rolls. It seems that anytime they have more than two tables seated, they struggle.   The food is OK for the price point, but if you're willing to pay just a few dollars more, you can find much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had paid $30 for the delivery order including $5 tip and I regret every single cent of it !!!!  The fried wonton is literally fried wonton skin! There's no cheese filling whatsoever!!  The lunch combo fried rice taste off like it was cooked like 2 days ago or something. The meat taste like fried mystery meat with sauce. The breading of the orange chicken is not crispy at all nor the sesame tofu , it has a chewy soggy breading. The sesame sauce has no flavor it just taste like syrup!  Ugh I want my money back !!!  We couldn't eat anything that we ordered so we end up throwing everything away. What a waste of money ! Sorry I would not return to this place ."}
{"text":"Sushi here is cheaper than most places and it's pretty decent too. (By the way, sushi for dine-in is 50% off right now)   Service is okay, I usually only see one waitress though since it's not too busy. They could also work on cleaning up the dining area a bit.  Overall, it's average like other Chinese restaurants in the area. It just has a bonus of sushi/tempura."}
{"text":"I have eaten Chinese food this is decent and reasonable price. I had the pork fried rice and spicy tuna/Philadelphia rolls. Sushi was fresh and good. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Simple Chinese place to order when you're craving to average and typical Chinese/American food. You can order online. Credit card process when then and delivery are quick. I was sick 2 weeks ago. And I need some soup but don't want to leave the house. So I opted to order from them. I ordered a large wonton and a large egg drop soup them. Very comforting. I must admit. I feel better right away.. I'm not sure it the familiarity but I'm sure it's NOT some kind of magical thing about it. They never screw up on the order.. and food delivered very hot. So til next time when I'm craving from soup again.. we will meet again then!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here and regularly get takeout and each time the food and service has been phenomenal. The guy that comes to our house when we order delivery is really friendly. Both the sushi and the Chinese food is good (and I love that they offer both). We've never waited that long to get food either, on average it's about 30 mins. The only (small) negative is that the spicy food often isn't spicy, but it's still delicious so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I can only recommend the dumplings (steamed) as \"good\". The house rice was oily and full of giant pieces of pork and chicken and about two over cooked shrimp.   Expensive for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Back in the day this was the best Chinese in the area, over the past few years they have been on the decline, delivery takes over an hour but they keep saying it will only be 30 minutes, when the food finally arrives its cold.  We recently received an order if french fries that appeared to have been thrown in the oil for less than a minute, totally white, still partially frozen inside and soggy.   The portions are getting smaller and smaller and it also appears the quality control is non existent.  Sadly after many years we will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"This place gets zero stars!  I ordered online at 3:05pm said it would be here at 3:59pm.  At 4:12 I call, and they tell me the driver is on the way.  Call back at 4:45pm because it is still not here.  The manager then tells me that it isn't their fault because they get their orders via fax, and if that goes out then they can't help when they get the order.  As a person who manages a restaurant I find this unacceptable.  They knew from the first phone call how long I had waited why didn't they say something then?  Terrible customer service, at my restaurant if something has gone wrong with our various delivery options we call the customer to notify them so that they aren't sitting there waiting.  I cannot believe how terrible this was."}
{"text":"I must just have different expectations for take out/delivery Chinese food. Quick delivery but the food was just ok. The Kung pao wasn't spicy at all which was very disappointing. The white rice was spot on. The Lo Mein with shrimp pretty much didn't have any taste. The veggie dumplings were not good at all, very mushy."}
{"text":"I have just endured THE WORST sushi of my life at this place.  Ordered the spicy yellowtail and spicy shrimp, 2 each.  The yellowtail roll had nothing but crunchy filler in it.  It had absolutely not a hint of fish smell, taste or texture to it.  Making matters worse, management offered me initially a 10% discount on my NEXT order.  After being told that all sushi places cut back on their yellowtail due to the high price, fully admitting that there was hardly a scrap of fish in the roll, they offered me a full refund on the 2 uneaten rolls, but would have to charge me for the dog food I accidentally ate.  Bad food, bad management, worst sushi ever.  Don't visit unless you are one of those that are on the fence about eating raw fish...if you are one of those, by all means order the spicy 'yellowtail'."}
{"text":"They have great lunch specials, and the food is good. The pricing is pretty fair as well. I don't think it's on the menu...but ask for the Gyoza!"}
{"text":"Had some food delivered and was not dissapointed.  I had the Szezuan beef and it was actually spicy."}
{"text":"A few steps above takeout with no shortness of taste, good portions, price, and taste. Service is a little slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is so nasty here. We ordered three different entrées, all the three where so bad. Please do yourself a favor by not eating here."}
{"text":"I USE TO go here a lot....always left a good tip 15-20%. But my LAST trip there, killed it with bad service again!!..... -___-. Ordered the usual sushi and chicken on a stick. Got my sushi but no chicken, no refills nothing..... asked about it and was told it's on it's way.....didn't get my chicken till I was about to leave. Won't be going back anytime soon bad service 3 times back to back!?....pft"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch. The PRICE is right, the food comes FAST, & the selections are spot on.  The sushi is FRESH & the there is always a special or two!  The vegetables are just perfect & the sauces sublime. The best Hot and Sour soup I've ever had and I don't even like Hot and Sour soup normally.  I'm a bit picky so the food has to be good! (I eat here several times a week & they DELIVER!.)"}
{"text":"2 of my co-workers and I decided to give Wang & King a try after reading other reviews.  The place is in a strip mall, on the end, which is sometimes suspicious.  The interior was cozy and the sushi bar was set up like it should be.  We were shown to a booth, which was a-ok with me.  The tables were so worn, we couldn't decide if they were trying to be kitchy with a retro look or if they just didn't care.  I decided to go with kitchy.   When we walked in, there was a sushi special that sounded great: a roll with mango, tuna and some other delicious items, for $7.99.  I decided I would have that, as did my 2 companions. When we ordered, we were told that was a dinner only special and not available for lunch.  Then why have the sign posted during lunch hours?   We placed our 2 and 3 roll sushi orders.  2 of us had miso soup, the other a salad.  The soup arrived and it was nearly clear.  Very watery and little taste.  The salad was all iceburg, and white.  The ginger dressing was pretty tasty.  I had salmon-avocado roll and a tuna-avocado roll.  Both were good, but very average.  Also I was charged an extra dollar for ordering tuna.  My companionstold me their rolls were also average. I had to ask for our bowls and salad plate to be removed, and after our order was taken, we never saw our original waitress until the check arrived.  Our food was brought to us by another server who wasn't sure what we ordered and even asked, \"What is this?\" when showing us the plates.  The service was pretty slow as well.  I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"The food is okay... Went there today, had been several times, asked for separate bills,the person I was with also asked for separate bills, the waitress came back again with the bill, she had written what the  amount was on the SAME bill, after asking twice for separate bills?  Said she could split it up between cards (we were paying cash?), finally I asked to see the manager and got the separate bills we had at this point asked for three times.  The food is fine, I guess, but what is the problem for having separate bills, also did not get refills on tea....or asked if we wanted or needed them."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Wang & King Asian Cafe. Although, we have never actually been to the restaurant, their delivery service is great! They always come on time. In my opinion they have the best chinese around the area. There is so many things to select from, whether you want sushi and miso soup or chicken and broccoli and wonton soup - the lettuce wraps are really good too!!"}
{"text":"Half-price sushi is the way to go - for fresh made good rolls and nigiri, this is the place.  There are a few others in the area, but none as cheap and unassuming as Wang King.  The different puns the name affords are also worth the visit.    Ambiance isn't superb - normal piped in music of chinese/japanese origin, a few booths and tables, never a ton of people.  Some things can look bad, like the blinds that just seem to get grungier.    The normal meals and plates that I've tried are usually just OK - the sushi is where it's at.  I could do soup and sushi here every week, no problem."}
{"text":"The Wang & King is one of the first restaurants I ate at when I moved to Charlotte so it seemed appropriate for my first yelp review. I love the sushi at this location, the special rolls are beautifully plated and standard rolls are 25% off when you dine in. Since I was just out of college when I moved here finding affordable sushi was exciting! I rarely get the Chinese options here, because I am such a big fan of their sushi but what I have tried has had huge portions. If you don't like sushi I would try their Thai red curry, but only if you like a good amount of spice.  In three years, visiting about once a month, I have only had bad service once. Otherwise the service has been extremely attentive!"}
{"text":"The service is HORRIBLE. Food is okay.. My last choice if I want quick sushi. They always mess something up."}
{"text":"Great affordable sushi specials and good soup.  Friendly, warm, attentive staff.  I always enjoy my meals here and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but is actually the best Americanized Chinese and sushi in south charlotte. Great prices, beer and wine available, clean, good portions, polite and fast service. Definitely worth the drive from Lake Wylie as way higher quality then either Panda Hut or Best China."}
{"text":"Well ordered out for lunch and got an asparagus roll, tempura veggie app and soup. Soup was so bad I threw it away. The fried asparagus roll they did not tell me had avocado in it which I'm Allergic too and react like food poisoning! So needless to say I ate a few before realizing and ended up being sick nonstop for over a day. Horrible Asian food and crappy service"}
{"text":"Not fancy but great for the price.  We eat here about once a week - very kind to the budget and the Chinese food as well as the sushi is quite good.  Fine for eat in and really wouldn't be bad for a nice meal but their lights are SOOOO bright, like a diner.  Sometimes the waitstaff has trouble understanding your order but they get it right.  If you have a cold, go by and get the chicken and rice soup - very soothing and good. Update - better for eat in than delivery. The seem to be understaffed for taking orders and delivery."}
{"text":"I only have had delivery from here and it's ok, just wish it was more consistent. You never know how long it will take and the food is either excellent or horrible. Great variety as they have a Japanese menu and also have a very good Pad Thai! Even if you order \"extremely spicy\" option it will not be spicy even to the most sensitive person. It's annoying."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2006. Their food is always great and they even have a good deal on Sushi rolls too. I suggest you try the Sesame Chicken or the Sweet & Sour Chicken. They even deliver to your house if you live in the Steele Creek area too. If you order any food over twenty five dollars then the delivery will be free. Always tip the delivery guy."}
{"text":"I've really only had take out here, but for Chinese take out- this is the best place. I always have unusually low expectations for take out Chinese food, but here they are great. Food is always timely, hot, very good & what you'd want from a delivery service. I always ask for my food to be \"Extra Spicy\" and I have to say it never is- but that's pretty usual for any restaurants in America. They do add more peppers. I'm guessing they don't want to offend someone by making the food too spicy. If you're looking for good/fast delivery and any basic Chinese menu item, this is the place. The others around, that I've tried locally, have never been as good as Wang & King. Will order again!"}
{"text":"It is convenient but don't expect too much. It is your basic Chinese restaurant. The sushi is comparable to Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"I come here quite often for sushi and at times for Chinese food but either way this is my go to place for sushi and Chinese food on my side of town. The servers are nice and quick. It's a nice little place for some quick sushi or Chinese food. Out of the nearest Chinese restaurants I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place to grab lunch on that side of town, it's clean, the staff is attentive and the food is decent."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on the reviews I saw here. I ordered the fried rice.. Very good. I can't give 5 stars because I reserve that for the exceptional; this place is good. I will definitely be back plus it's inexpensive for very large portions!"}
{"text":"This gets the award for one of the craziest names.  Wang and King.  I lol everytime I pass by.  The lunch specials are super cheap and come out within minutes of ordering.  They also serve sushi which is fairly good and well priced.  It's a good place to go when you have a hankering for Chinese.  And they have no problems whatsoever with splitting checks.  (always a plus!)"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Wang & King last night.  We got the following: Spring Rolls, Dumplings, Thai Red Curry Chicken and Lemon Chicken.  The Spring Rolls were great, even though the mustard wasn't hot.  The Dumplings were decent, however the dough was extremely thick.  The This Red Curry Chicken tasted like seafood and was disgusting.  The Lemon Chicken was decent, however the chicken was over cooked and dry.  I would try someplace else if I were you."}
{"text":"Good sushi, very nice staff, amazing prices.  They give crunchy wonton strips while you wait and they are just really friendly.  The sushi is where it's at..we always order way too much and i just can't stop eating it...so good.  I'm sure there are other places with better choices, etc, but none match the overall joy i get from coming here.  Just a good place all around."}
