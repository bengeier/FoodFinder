{"text":"Great food and service. Very authentic. Go to this place for spicy food. The noodles are goods try the pig ear."}
{"text":"It's a very nice, clean restaurant. The service is super good! I can say that's the best, most authentic southern chinese restaurant in Vegas. And in deed, absolute, no msg. Unlike the foods in most of the restaurants in china town, (which are packed with salt, msg and soaked in syrup). This restaurant uses no msg or preservers, taste super nature and authentic. 
I ordered their signature rice noodle soup. You can tell the difference. The soup is free range chichen soup. Super.
Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"The Beef Hot Pot and Chongqing street noodles will complete your life. Very tender and flavorful. Very highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for lunch. We ordered the barbecue chicken soup with Shanghai noodles, shrimp wonton soup, and spicy beef soup with shanghai noodles. All pretty good. But, the bbq chicken soup
was exceptional. I would defiantly go again for the chicken. 

FYI, the restaurant is hard to find. It's hidden in the basement of Sheraton."}
{"text":"I've been eating at restaurants in the PATH for nearly seven years now. This is still my favourite. I love the noodles and soup and any of their meats will be just awesome."}
{"text":"This is really good for food court!  The man who looked to be the owner is always friendly.

I had the fish ball vermicelli and it was quite tasty.  Decent broth, fresh bok choy, and good quality fish balls (you know how some fish balls can tasty fishy or simply sketchy).  For $5.75, I have no complaints.  

Lemongrass Chicken with rice noodle - the rice noodle is really really mushy, which I didn't enjoy.  The chicken tasted well, like cheap meat with fat and chewy (tendons?) attached, and the flavour was a bit gross to me.  I will avoid it in the future.

Vegetarian noodle - Tofu was quite salty, but all veggies were great.  Again, at those prices, I can't complain much."}
{"text":"Very dishonest. You can only get your 15% discount when you give them a 5 star review on Yelp. That's how they got all the 5 stars. Food was blunt and horrible. They have a banner outside the restaurant showing cash coupons will be given but we spent about $40 and get nothing. We do not support dishonest people. Then we have to give a 5 star review to get 15% off the bill. If the food was really good, you don't need to force people to do that. We do not need that 15% off and this is an HONEST review. Any restaurant on Spring Mountain can easily beat this. Try the food out if you don't believe!"}
{"text":"Authentic taste!  Best service.  Elegant decorated restaurant conveniently located near Rainbow and Sahara  (Northwest corner). 
Large portion.  So many options to choose from."}
{"text":"Noodle King is a decent spot in the path if you're craving soup noodle. It's a less expensive lunch option and the portions are pretty generous. Taste is fairly average and nothing to rave about, but it satisfies my cravings. 

I usually order the shrimp wonton or bbq chicken with rice noodle. The bbq pork is kind of dry and they pour a ton of sauce over it to cover the dryness."}
{"text":"Ordered some dumplings and noodles but was overall unimpressed. The food was just subpar. Both the noodles and dumplings were dry when I had them. As well, I did not have chopsticks delivered with the food.

Delivery time was good but that's about it."}
{"text":"Long line up snaking around the entire food court speaks for itself.  It is located in the vibrant underground PATH in downtown Toronto. 

Their specialty is soup with 4 types of noodles to choose from.  My favourite is the spicy beef with thick flat rice noodles with bak choy & broccoli.  If you want extra spicy ask for spicy broth.  I could probably eat this everyday.  Honestly I have not tried any other soup since I was introduced to this spicy beef soup.  My friend love their shrimp wonton soup & no complain there.

Avoid going there between 12 - 1 noon. I try to go there around 11.45 am before rush hour or after 1 pm

Love it there and plan to go back there for my soup fix & great price point with very generous portion"}
{"text":"The noodles where very werid. Supper soggy an stringy almost gagging. This place for noodle soup dishes is gagging."}
{"text":"We had the Chongqing Street Noodle Soup and Fish and Tofu Hotpot.
The Hotpot was yummy, but the noodles were AMAZING.
We got medium spicy level, and it wasn't spicy at all :)
They're really nice and the service is great so I'm wondering why it's so empty here during lunch time :(
I was enjoying the food a little TOO much and now I'm uncomfortably full, it was worth it though lol"}
{"text":"Yunnan food takes a different twist to traditional Chinese noodle dishes. There is more flavor and spices to it, which I like. Food came out fast and there is a 15% off if you yelp review it"}
{"text":"the rice noodles were overcooked and breaking, but the shrimp wontons were good. Next time ill try the egg noodles(wonton noodles), i heard that one is good."}
{"text":"Can't complain about the service, but seriously, it is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been, food is really BADDDDD!!!!!!!!Wouldn't return even if they paid me to. Also be aware that they offer discount if you write a good review on yelp, that's how we were trick into it!! Completely below restaurant quality!!!!!!!

CAN'T TRUST YELP ANYMORE IF THEY ALLOW THESE FAKE REVIEWS TO EXIST!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A good yunnan food restaurant in Las Vegas. Good place for spicy lovers.Great food, highly recommend, especially the hotpot stick."}
{"text":"I stopped by after work to try their wonton soup and I must say, I was surprised! The flavour of the broth was perfect and it was so affordable. I am totally addicted now"}
{"text":"This was hand-made noodle with good texture and the sauce was spicy and flavorful.  We had both Dan Dan noodle, Szechuan style, and Zhajung noodle, Beijing style.  Both of these were tasteful and authentic.  I was pleasantly surprised to be able to taste these in US, not in Taiwan or China."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food with nice presentation. Good food and good service. If you like spicy Chinese food, definitely check it out. If you like non-spicy, the rice noodle is yummy. They have hot pot as well, and we'll try it next time."}
{"text":"First of all, all of the pictures and some of the comments do not belong to the current ownership. The owner should contact yelp to make it right. 

This place actually makes great northern style Chinese cuisine. This is pretty much as authentic as you can get in Las Vegas. My favorite is their in-house hand-made noodle. The texture is always perfect. I highly recommend all the noodle dishes. In soup, dry, stir fry, they are ALL GREAT!! They probably have the best northern style Chinese noodles in town. 

Nothing fancy about their decor and vibe. Definitely not one of those that tries to look hips and young, like Shang noodles, JINYA ramen etc.. Service can be a hit and miss and at least they are always nice. 

They are not in a good location so I guess that's why they get under the radar. They are hidden in the strip mall at the northeast corner of Sahara and rainbow. The entrance door is small and kind of dark. But they are right next to a big doggy care which has a big sign. The mall is not busy at all so parking is never a problem. Amazon Now also does delivery for them."}
{"text":"Not bad, because it is a newly opened restaurant, some food is not perfect.
Over time there will be progress.
Service attitude is very good, hope to come back in a few weeks there will be a great progress."}
{"text":"For a food court restaurant this place is great.  I had their Spicy Beef with rice noodle.  The dish had big chunks of tender beef (a fair portion of meat), TONS of noodles, a piece of broccoli, and a few pieces of bok choy.  It came to a total of $7.35 - well worth the cost for a large portion size.   I think next time I would ask for no broccoli or bok choy, I don't think they really added anything to the dish.  My friend ordered the Spicy Beef with - 1/2 Beef and 1/2 Shrimp Wonton and it was the same price of my dish.  I will definitely try this in the future, she speaks very highly of the wontons.  The dish is pretty spicy but they do ask if you want the spice, you can get it without the spicy broth.
Note: The picture listed is of the King Noodle restaurant in Chinatown - NOT the Noodle King restaurant we are reviewing."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck in this area of the PATH. Quit staring at the $10 burger combos and grab a bowl of healthy noodles instead."}
{"text":"Very decent noodle place.  It offers 4 types of noodle for selection.  When a friend told me about this place I am a bit skeptical because it's in a food court inside path, but the quality is above my expectation as a fast, food court meal.  My favour is BBQ chicken noodle and I normally add one order of shrimp wonton to go with it.  The broth is light yet flavourful, and the egg noodle is crunchy to my liking.  Chicken leg is tender and well done.  Other recommend item is spicy beef noodle which is quite yummy but not that spicy.  Price is cheap even comparing with other food court joints."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite food court noodle places.  You have 4 choices of noodles - Shanghainese, vermicelli, wonton, thick vermicelli.  Once you have decided, you can then pick your toppings.  I usually choose the BBQ Drumstick, sometimes Spicy Beef or brisket.  You can ask not to have the spicy soup.  For the vegetables, there are 2 choices - broccoli or Bok Choy.  If you don't say it, Bok Choy will be given.  If I am very hungry, I will add 3 pork dumplings to my noodles at extra cost. 

This place has the longest line up in the food court.  So be early.  I am always wondering the boss who handle the noodle with such repetitive motion for every cup of it that his arm must be very tire and painful after work.  Hope he can keep it up as I really like the quality food there with affordable price.

If you paid by Debit card, there is a service charge"}
{"text":"We stumbled across  Noodle King while visiting Las Vegas for Thanksgiving. After a few days of turkey leftovers-it was time for a menu change and this proved to be a lucky find!  The new owner's daughter is knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating - creating for us just the mixture we were hoping for. You can tell this owner has been in the restaurant business for 40+ years and this Las Vegas neighborhood is lucky to have him here now...the food portions are generous and you can taste that the food is freshly made. One tip: the lunch specials are available any time - so there is no need to limit your menu choices. 

I definitely recommend supporting this local restaurant!"}
{"text":"Gross. Just gross. Rice was mushy and cold. Braised pork was all fat. And the sauce on the plate was mostly oil. The only thing I could eat was the broccoli. I changed from 1 star to 3 because my husband said his was ok except for too much ginger and they didn't charge me for the meal I couldn't eat."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service and great prices.
I wasn't offered any discount to post this review, I am posting it because the food is simply amazing."}
{"text":"Nice place and nice service just the price is little high er than normal"}
{"text":"Great little noodle place in the mall under Sheraton. Doesn't look like anything special but is so much better than any of those typical mall food places. Tasty food that doesn't make you feel like shit! And friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place embodies everything that I look for in a restaurant: delicious food at a great value. The first time we went, we tried the spicy beef noodle soup and the barbecued duck noodle soup. Both were very good, but we decided that we liked the duck better, especially because my husband had them add some of those smokey spicy broth from the beef soup into the Duck Soup. That really made a big difference! The pieces of duck that they put into the soup were very generous. At any other place, the duck by itself would have cost the price of the soup. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the just the right amount of bite to them. The chili oil condiment was also very good and better than most I've had. I believe it was home made. There was a sour component to it that I really liked. 

We were incredibly lucky that this was in the food court in the basement of our hotel. It was a great affordable option for lunch every day. If I lived nearby, I would definitely be frequenting it for lunch all the time."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Start to finish, from the spilled water all over us to the deceiving coupons this place is a disaster!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best wonton noodle soup in all of Toronto!!!

The shrimp wontons, actually have shrimp in them...full size shrimps and not just minced up shrimps.

Consider getting some BBQ Pork in your noodle soup for an extra bit of joyfulness!!! :)"}
{"text":"First of all, the taste of food deserves 5 stars! But, I take 1 star off due to the slow speed from the kitchen. My best advice: Don't come hungry!

When we arrived, there were 3 tables occupied at Sunday afternoon 1pm, a bit lighter than expected. The staff were attentive and restaurant is clean. We were puzzled by the traffic.

We ordered beef pancake rolls, seafood noodle soup, duck, xiao long bao and a vegetable dish. I feel XLBs are lack of taste, but everything else tasted very good. 

But, man, it took very very very long time for each dish to arrive! The first dish arrived 25 minutes after we put in our order and guess what? It was delivered to us by mistake! It was someone else's order....we finally understand why don't they have a packed restaurant with great tasting food!

Worth a try, really, just don't come hungry!"}
{"text":"Menu is in Chinese, which is an indicator that this place is delicious af. Stop reading this and go eat!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a spicy Chicken rice noodle soup.  I ordered, I was excited, this place looked authentic,  and what a let down.  

The noodles were so overcooked that they soaked up the broth off the bowl.  So no broth,  just fat limp falling apart rice  noodles.  The spicy Chicken on top was decent but not enough flavor or spice.  It was accompanied by one piece of broccoli,  one piece of mushroom,  and soggy mung beans that died yesterday.  RIP mung beans.  I picked them out and put them in a small bowl and covered them in a paper napkin,  I said a few words."}
{"text":"I love eating here on my comfort food/cheat days.

They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.

You can pick rice dish too.

There is vegetarian options.

Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.

Staff is nice and friendly.

Line is long but service is fast."}
{"text":"This is not Yunnan Cuisine anymore (now called Noodle King), they have changed ownership, menu is different as well. GROUPON USER BEWARE! THEY CHARGE YOU 18% TIP IF YOU ARE USING GROUPON (which didn't indicated on the Groupon website)!!!!

FOOD IS NOT GREAT compared w/the previous Yunnan Cuisine, so I wouldn't recommend this as their noodle taste very raw (hard, not cooked through). You have been warned!"}

And plus this so called chef was giving away appetizer to their chinese customers and not to everybody who is been waiting for their food to come out and be serve! Take note this guests come behind us and was treated very nicely!!!!!!! BEVERAGE WAIT 15mins EACH FOOD SERVED 40-45MINS!!! TO GO BOX AND CHECK 20MINS!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Noodle King is a fantastic place for a cheap, tasty lunch in the Financial District. I stopped by for lunch today having seen all of the positive reviews, and I wasn't disappointed.

I ordered the lemongrass chicken with rice noodles, and an order of pork wontons on the side. The total came to $9 which is very reasonable, given what that would get you at other fast food places. The lineup was long but moved extremely quickly and the service was friendly and efficient.

The noodle and broth were exceptional and the chicken was of decent quality and was perfectly cooked. The wontons were hot and tasty, but didn't come with any soy or other dipping sauce. I noticed a sauce tray by the register so maybe I was supposed to get my own.

I struggled to finish it all and shared the wontons with my colleagues who also said they were pretty good. While I am no noodle aficionado, they are definitely the best I have had outside of Chinatown. A solid four stars and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"So this isn't the first time i've been here, and i remember not being that impressed being here a few years ago. According to my friends review, it was in late 2015. Came here again recently with family by recommendation by my mother's coworker. One thing to notice, is the name of the restaurant is NOT what they serve anymore, and it's almost borderline \"false advertisement\". The chinese name of this restaurant is also ridiculously similar to Joe's Shanghai in NYC. It is NOT the same ! ! 

So back to the review. Considering the location of this place, on the NW corner of Rainbow and Sahara, facing south, adjacent to the Harley Davidson, it is not what you would expect a chinese restaurant to be at. Upon my late arrival after getting off work, there was no other customers besides my own family at the restaurant. They were in the midst of ordering food so i just sat down. One thing they had called to \"reserve\" beforehand is the tea smoked duck. Apparently theres limited quantity per day or something to that nature. 

Rice is served/charged per bowl/bucket. $1 per bowl, or $4 or $5 options for a bucket of rice. I dont know what the difference between the $4 or $5 option is but we had gotten the $5 option, and gets about 6 bowls of rice. 

So about the food, for those i can actually find a name to match XD 

Tea smoked duck (???) - This was actually pretty good. Very nice tea smokey flavor in the skin and meat. The skin was pretty crispy. We only got 1/2 a duck as that was all that was left for the night but it was enough (or rather more than enough for 6 people). The duck is served with mini steamed buns that you can eat the duck similar to like peking duck, except not only skin. The flavor was pretty decent overall and i think is one of their better items that we had. 

Chives pocket (????) - This is a \"pocket\" style dish with a housemade dough pocket stuffed with chopped chives, glass noodles, eggs. The flavor of the stuff was fairly mild, could use some additional flavoring, but it was pretty decent. The pocket itself was well made and had a good chewiness to it. Add a little splash of vinegar and it was yum yum ! Each order comes with 2 pockets cut in half, so 4 pieces. 

Beef roll (????) - Green onion pancake wrapped beef with some spears of cucumber and hoisin sauce. As with the chives pocket, the green onion pancake also seems housemade as the outside seems quite good, and pan fried to a crisp but not entirely. The outside was flaking off but inside was still nice and chewy. The cucumber adds some freshness to the \"heaviness\" of the beef/hoisin sauce which makes this dish a nice appetizer to share. Each order cuts with 2 rolls, cut in half, so 4 pieces. 

\"Water Cooked Beef\" (????) - This dish seems quite differently made compared to other ones i've had at other restaurants such as Chengdu taste, Yunnan Garden, etc. The \"spice\" factor seems quite mild in terms of flavor, numbing factor, and heat level, but the beef they used was very tender and \"soft\". We had actually taken the leftovers and added more ingredients to it a day after, and was spicier XD ! 

Twice cooked pork (???) - Fairly standard thin slices of pork cooked with large pieces of leek, onions, and bell pepper. Nothing too special in terms of preparation or flavor. Typical twice cooked pork, or at least what i can remember LOL

ok, now the uh im not sure what this is actually called.... LOL 

Cold appetizer - we had a cold appetizer that consisted of beef stomach and some sort of beef slice. I think this is called ???? which is made of thinly sliced beef, and beef offal (according to Wiki). Lol. The offal was a bit soft but overall, the flavor was nice. Its served cold so its not so spicy. Has a nice mild numbing factor. 

Vegetarian thing.... - overhearing convo, it was supposed to be a vegetarian duck but it was more like rolled soybean curd with a light dizzle of sesame oil, and maybe some other flavor. Very simple and light. Also served cold 

Spicy noodle seafood soup thing... - This is something i definitely dont know the name of. The noodles are housemade or resembled handmade noodles. Inconsistent thickness. Nice and chewy. If i recall correctly, the name had something about stir-frying but for some odd reason, it was in a soup form. We didn't question it. The soup base was mildly spicy and red. Various seafood inside like mussel on a half shell, imitation crab, and some other stuff. Not bad of a dish to share or eat alone. This was probably the \"most spicy\" item. That being said, it wasn't that spicy. 

Overall, this place is ok. Mildly out of the way compared to other similar restaurants. The duck is probably the only thing i'd return for, if anything."}
{"text":"Over the past year, there have been a lot of resto's popping up around the Valley promoting the traditional taste of regional Chinese cuisine. A lot of these restaurants are doing authentic dishes of the Yunnan, Sichuan, among other local provinces in China. There is a place that I believe to be doing the best version of this recent trend in Vegas, and that place would be Yunnan Cuisine.

Located on a slightly divey strip mall on west Sahara, if you walked in the door, you would think that it's just another Chinese restaurant, doing the same fare that most people in this country have grown up on. But, looks can be deceiving. 

If you've never had traditional Sichuan or Yunnan style food before, this might seem like a brand new experience. My advice? Order everything. No, I mean, stick to the noodle dishes first, you will not be disappointed.

I decided to order some appetizers. First were the cold pork ear strips. The pork ears were cut thinly and gave a great crunch and chew to the dish. They were lightly coated with a red pepper flake sauce that gave a sufficient amount of heat without overpowering the pork ears. The celery were crisp and fresh and complimented the pig ears well. The spicy chicken cubes were ok, and so were the  Sichuan pickled vegetables, which were more like pickled cabbage. They had a slight tanginess to them.

Next, we had some entrees. The steamed fish with green peppers came out first. It tasted like they used catfish or that sort, and it was very good. It was steamed in a ginger scallion broth, and was topped with some crisp green peppers. A very addicting dish, with my spoon constantly begging for more. The lamb pot came out next. This was an all-star dish. There was a slight sweetness to the dish, with combining the savory aspects of the lamb, created a winning combo. There was no gaminess to the lamb whatsoever, and if you would have told me I was eating beef.. I would have believed you.

Where I think Yunnan really excels is their noodle dishes. They even have a page on their menu dedicated to what they truly specialize in, their Yunnan rice noodle dishes. I tried out their Spicy Chicken Rice Noodle soup. As soon as it arrived at my table, I knew the yum yums were about to begin. The broth wasn't too spicy but provided enough kick that I was looking for. And, I liked the fact that their was a lingering garlic flavor to the broth which I enjoyed very much. The noodles were fantastic. Imagine a thinner version of bun bo hue style noodles, rice noodles in a thin tube shape. For a second, I thought I was eating flour based noodles, but they were indeed made of rice. Well balanced all around.

Another home run for me was their Chongqing Street Noodle Soup. I saw pictures of the soup, and I just had to try it. The broth was amazing as well. I liked that they balanced their Sichuan peppercorns in their dish, not too much, but just enough to elevate it without numbing my mouth completely. The noodles were chewy and well cooked, and the ground pork and vegetables rounded out all the flavors.

The service here was great, it's a new team, but I think they will find their footing very soon. They get better every time I visit. The prices are fair and the portions are really good as well. I wouldn't necessarily call this place a dive, but it is borderline, and I like places like that. Out of all the Sichuan and Yunnan places in Vegas, this may be my favorite. Even though there will always be places that do beef and broccoli, and crab rangoons, I'm glad that their are business' that are willing to step out of the box and bring people more of their traditional foods and taste from their homelands. Yunnan Cuisine is 5 stars in my book and I can't wait too come back!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy beef with thin egg noodles.  With a pop total of $10.20 with tax.  Not sure noodles are made in house. Broth was good with the right amount of heat. After 2pm no crowds."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today after looking for a place with good won ton soup. Once reading reviews on yelp that Noodle King place has good soup for reasonable prices ($6 for a large shrimp dumpling soup) I had to give it a try.

TIP:  Noodle King is in the underground PATH network assessable from the Sheraton Hotel on Queen St W

The soup was good but didn't have much in it. Mine had shrimp wontons, noodles (of my choice, which was a plus) and 1 piece of broccoli and a few pieces of bock choy. I wish there were at least more veggies in the soup. Overall though it was yummy, but by the end of the soup I was bored from eating the same tasting mouthfuls. 

Will go back again when I have craving for wont ton soup but will request more veggies in it."}
{"text":"The food is really nothing special other than being \"cheap\" by downtown standard. That in itself should earn 3 stars. But their service was terrible, not to mention they did not accept my card saying they don't have the machine that works. But then the guy behind me used the same and they let him use it. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for lunch.  #1 busiest place on the PATH.  Go early to avoid long line ups.  You can choose from 4 type of noodles.  I usually get the BBQ chicken noodles for $6 after tax.  They take debit/credit as well.  Service was super quick they literally have your food within 30 secs.  The food court seating area is small so if you go on prime time you might need to wait."}
{"text":"Cheap, good broth, good noddles and pancakes. It's hard to find actually Chinese food, not American Chinese. They're pretty legit and still cheap."}
{"text":"The place clearly needs no more introductions, it's a favorite among Chinese noodle lovers, and for people who are looking to save money and get a decent lunch. 

A word of advice would be to get there early and avoid the lunch rush at 12pm. If you find yourself there after 12pm, worry not, the line will be long, but the wait won't be due to the assembly line - like efficiency. The only thing to worry about is finding a seat and enjoy those tasty noodles. 

My personal favorite is the BBQ chicken topping (on your choice of 4 types of noodles), and I would ask them to add a little spicy sauce (from the spicy braised beef) to my soup, which really gives your soup that extra little kick. 

For $8 or less, you will never leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"Very nice cuisine! The food is huge and very affordable. Their signature plates are the noodle, a different noodle from all other Asian noodles. It is called Mi Xian in Chinese and it is smooth when you sip it and sticky when you chew it! I ordered the beef noodle and the broth is also a strong taste of beef. It is a little plain so I add the pepper salt ready on the table. Their cold plate is also tasty for me. I'll come back next time."}
{"text":"- used to work in the area, and noodle king was in the rotation for PATH places to eat. (it's found below the Sheraton hotel in the food court with the mcds)
- the man who takes the orders is hillarious.
- you get to choose the type of noodles for your noodle soup (mein, rice noodle, etc)
- spicy beef brisket is a good one to get... and you can ask for less spice if you are a wimp like moi.
- great price if you want your lunch plus a drink to cost you less than $6"}
{"text":"This place used to be the cheapest lunch by far. Now it is still cheaper but the gap has closed. 

I still give it 5 stars as the food is very consistently good. You have to go a bit early to avoid the lines but this ensures the food is rotated and you are always getting a fresh batch. 

The rice noodle soup with BBQ chicken is the fan fav.  Try it and love it."}
{"text":"Nice to have something good without venturing into chinatown. Pleasantly surprised at their portions. The braised beef noodles were on point. And the handmade noodles were delicious. Enough to feed two."}
{"text":"I've been here twice recently and really want to like this place but just have a hard time finding anything that I really like. I think another Yunnan restaurant has left this one in the dust. I eat and eat hoping my taste buds would find love here but it looks like my taste buds already found love with another Yunnan restaurant and this one just can't compare. 

The lamb hotpot looks great in the photos but when it was brought to our table, I find it sorely disappointing. First, it was smaller that I thought. When we first walked into the restaurant, the lady in the next booth was eating a hotpot and it was huge. Our lamb hotpot was a lot smaller so maybe they were low on lamb today. Second, it had under cooked vegetables and not enough lamb. And I don't know how this is possible with Yunnan cuisine but it lacked flavor besides just being spicy. 

The noodles here are decent but nothing amazing. I would eat this if I was hungry but don't particularly care for it. The Chongqing street noodle was decent but nothing amazing. I've also tried two of their beef noodles from the previous visit, one was the beef hotpot noodle and another beef noodle stew. They were also rather mediocre. 

Service here is generally friendly and decent. They give you incentive to write them a great yelp review with a meal discount or free soda (as seen on their menu). I do feel somewhat duped when I saw that as I had higher expectations for the food."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious and authentic. What more can I say? Can't go wrong here if you're in the mood for Chinese noodles!"}
{"text":"I asked for braised beef noodle soup. They probably ran out of beef and gave me their stir fry beef instead. They also put mushrooms and snow peas in it? It's like they dumped a stir fry into a broth. Not what I wanted at all. Could have just said they ran out instead of try to make money off of me. I also waited for 30 minutes for my food for to go to make things worse. Never coming back again. They were also talking about me in Chinese assuming I can't understand because I don't feel comfortable speaking it. I should have read all the reviews instead of just looking at the rating. I feel less alone that I'm not the only one so disappointed though."}
{"text":"They changed their name from yunan cuisine to noodle king. It's mostly Sichuan spicy food. No longer yunan style cuisine. Noodles pretty good. They do have a sign for a mandatory 18% gratuity for using Groupon. $1 more for noodles when go there on weekend , nights, holidays. But overall the noodles taste fresh, if u order mild it is actually spicy, and pretty clean. It's hidden behind the buffet place. Inexpensive."}
{"text":"Small hidden, clean nice staff good food. Had the house special noodles very refreshing."}
{"text":"Above average Chinese food.  We ordered soup dumplings and beef noodle soup.  I've had better soup dumplings.  The noodle soup was flavorful and full of tender braised beef.  The prices were pretty reasonable and the service was very good.  I would return for the beef soup."}
{"text":"They got the C in 3 months again.food is good.Look like bussiness is ok at this location.Just need cleaning.safety is first at this tourist state"}
{"text":"Let's try this restaurant yesterday, we ordered a spicy beef dish, no taste, this dish and skewer with vegetables and meat. Also don't have any taste. The food here may be more suitable for americans. Leave the waiter gave a $5 cash coupon, followed by handwritten, next time need spending $30 to use! I can't understand! I won't be go to the restaurant!"}

{"text":"I discovered this place because I noticed it was the only place in the PATH for food that had an insane line up at lunchtime. I assumed it to be \"LEGIT\" and grabbed some soup there.

The long line moves super fast, the soup is delicious and one of the cheaper places I have found to eat lunch in the financial district.

You would be doing yourself a disservice by not eating here."}

{"text":"Probably one of the best food court options for chinese food in the city! I adore the shrimp wonton noodle soup with the egg noodles. They add lots of fresh bok choy and I top it all off with roasted chili oil.

Let's face it: there are many terrible food options when it comes to food court chinese. Beyond the scope of sweet and sour pork and fried rice is Noodle King-- Fast, fresh and conveniently located in the basement of the Sheraton Centre.

It's a solid choice for a low cost lunch. Unfortunately, this food court is uninspiring as far as decor does. A better option is to take your food up to the Sheraton's second floor courtyard, or over to Osgoode Hall and enjoy the sunshine.

{"text":"Absolutely the best hot n sour soup in Las Vegas. The tea smoked duck has the right amount of smokiness and the meat is moist and the skin is crispy. Potstickers are pan fried, not deep fried like Most other places. Twice cook pork is tender and the leek is snappy with a little spicy kick. Perfect! Sesame mochi ball in soup is a very traditional northern Chinese dessert and added a great finish to the meal. Only reason for 4 star is because the servers are clueless."}
{"text":"Another Yunnan restaurant in town! I love Yunnan cuisine and I'm on the hunt one that compares in China. 

I hate that feeling going to a new restaurant and seeing a sign that says \"free something for a review\". That's a red flag right there. 

I ordered the Chongqing street noodles $7. It came out pretty fast and the bowl was decent sized. 

Honestly, the flavor wasn't there. The broth was on the thinner and oily side. I keep expecting a nice strong flavor but nothing. The noodles were okay. The noodles reminded me the cheap dry flat noodles my dad would cook me when I was young. 

The service was attentive. Everyone is Chinese and I think it's family owned."}

{"text":"Good food and very spicy. Noddles are really good. We had the hot pot stick it's good shrimp and fish balls are pretty good."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a year, and it's nice to see that their prices are still the same as before.

Lines are long during lunch hour. Note that due to the floor-plan, and the fact that the food vendor next door also has huge lines, you may find yourself in the wrong line. Pay close attention to the direction of the traffic.

Items range from $5 to $8, averaging $6 before tax. I usually pay cash. They used to charge extra 25 cents for using card, but not sure if they still do it. They had a little hand-written sign put up on the side but I didn't see it this time.

The line moves fast. Pick your rice or noodles (4 kinds), pick your meat/vegetables, then proceed to pay for it. There are some condiments on the side if you need some extra flavor. Whole process usually lasts 20-30 seconds.

Portion size isn't too bad: you get your rice or noodles, decent amount of meat, and some fresh vegetables. Taste's alright. Not too oily.

Food court gets busy during lunch, so finding a seat may be challenging.
If you're planning to eat there, I would recommend just getting it to go and walking over to another food court a few minutes away which usually has more seats.

Unless you're heading to chinatown, this is probably the next cheapest place for a bowl of rice or noodles with meat and veggies."}

{"text":"I MADE VEGGIE PHO TODAY!!!!!!!! 

Well, sort of.

Today was one of those days that I should have called HR and let them know that I'll be leaving early because I can't function at work anymore.  After a week of being on antibiotics, I think my stupid cold relapsed and stole my appetite.  I spent the entire day wanting to eat, but really couldn't, and thinking about what would make me feel better, but won't make me throw up.  My co-worker and I had arranged to have lunch today earlier on the week, so even though I was sick, I was looking forward to it, because I know I could always get soup noodles and it usually makes me feel better. Case in point: I was at my sickest last week, but felt a little better after having veggie pho at Thai Island (see my review below).  Although the veggie pho at Thai Island was good, I wanted to go to another place along the PATH that also makes veggies noodles, but at a cheaper price and taste just as good.  I also wanted to compare the veggie pho I had last week to this place's veggie noodle, to see what's so \"PHO\" about last week's pho. 

Noodle King is a fast food joint along the PATH that's between the Sheraton Hotel and the Munich Re Centre. By its name, it's obvious that this place specializes in noodles, particularly soup noodles. Noodle King is operated by a friendly and quick Chinese crew -they know time is money and that the crowd they're serving are the busy, busy business types. Although they serve soup noodles, their menu is not limited at all:  example: they offer about 4 different types of noodles: shanghai, ho fun, egg noodles and rice noodles; fresh meat ingredients: duck, pork, beef, fish balls, wontons; and fresh vegetables: mainly bak choy and broccoli. 

Now for the good news, for my vegans/ vegetarians, and veggie-lovers-who-also-eat-meat-but-can-take-a-break-from-consuming-dead-carcasses: they have a vegetarian soup noodle special every day! The vegetarian special comes with the noodle of your choice, 2 fried tofu squares, carrots, green onions, broccoli, and bak choy. Also, upon request, they have a veggie broth (that isn't full of MSG or salt) to go with the soup noodle. If you read my Thai Island review, you might remember that I didn't like how they didn't have red vinegar, lime and only hot sauce. But Noodle King has them all: red vinegar, Viet hot sauce, hot chili oil, soy sauce, and fresh limes!  Needless to say, I prefer Noodle King to Thai Island. Not only are their soup noodles equally as (if not more) tasty and satisfying as Thai Island's, they are  generous with their veggies, have the right condiments (it's NOT pho without the red vinegar and lime, even I know that, and I haven't had pho until recently), offer a non-salty vegetable broth,  operated by a friendly staff, but their vegetarian soup noodle special is the CHEAPEST soup noodle on their menu! This means you can stay slim and your wallet can stay fat. 

With regards to the \"Veggie Pho\" bit. I found Thai Island's \"veggie pho\" very similar to the \"vegetarian soup noodle\" I had at Noodle King. The only difference is that the Noodle King's creation had finer noodles, and it did not have raw bean sprouts, cilantro, and fried tofu. Disregarding these minor differences, the 2 soup noodles taste very similar. Which is why my claim that \"I MADE VEGGIE PHO TODAY\" is somewhat valid, if not valid in its entirety, and there's also nothing distinctively \"pho\" about veggie soup noodles."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Noodle King.  Quick, cheap, and tasty!
Just be sure to go before 12 or after 1 or the line-up gets pretty long."}
{"text":"This take-away counter features noodle soups (your choice of noodles) and rice dishes with pork, chicken, wonton and seafood (fish balls and shrimp). Located in the PATH in the food court underneath the Sheraton Hotel on Queen street. I come here about once week for my noodle soup fix-rice noodles paired with pork wontons with a scoop of spicy broth for an extra kick-for $4.75! Prices are cheap here, everything here is under $7 and although the lineups can be long from 11-2 the service is quick and efficient. I come here for my noodle soup fix and this place kicks thai express's butt any day."}
{"text":"The wonton is much much better compared to any other ones served in foodcourt. The best part is you can add fish balls for additional cost. If you don't like bak choy you can get broccoli instead.

If you like a kick to the flavour of the noodle, you can ask them to give you a little brisket sauce added to the broth. One of the best wonton noodles for foodcourt. 

Will be back even when the walk is a little far from my office."}
{"text":"First found this place from my mum, great place to have a nice quiet meal. Food is great so much better than the other Yun Nan restaurant in chinatown! The inferior is super cute and warm ^^"}
{"text":"3 1/2 is more fair. The food is very good, and they're bringing many dishes that you don't find too much in town. Duck gizzard with celery was excellent. Cold needles were also excellent. Special fish and tofu soup was decent and a noodle soup was fine, but boring. Over all we'll return. Half a point off because they require customers to post 5 star reviews to get a discount and I think that's deceiving. Obviously I didn't care about a discount. I just saw them do that. 15% off but you have to write a 5 star review and the person I saw them do this with hadn't even ordered yet."}
{"text":"Very solid lunch place for cheap! The taste is great and comparable to places in Chinatown. 

I tried the pork wonton noodle and got great portions with noodles for $6.25 tax included. I also like the fact that the takeout container is a bowl and doesn't make it soggy. The menu is big and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great service! Fast food  I enjoyed the place and will be coming soon the servings are Huge."}

{"text":"This place is really good. It's not Americanized and they hand pull their own noodles. 

I've eaten here twice. The first time I had a lunch special, which was tasty, but not stand-out. Today, I had noodle soup. It was amazing. The broth was flavorful and the noodles were perfect. I will certainly be back. 

The prices are good. $8 for a lunch special with soup, egg roll and tea. The noodles were also $8 for a giant bowl. I'm looking forward to the dumplings!"}
{"text":"The beef Szechuan stew was amazing and addicting! Very spicy, very tasty broth and the noodles were homemade."}
{"text":"Located in a food court in the PATH network.  I entered via Sheraton on Queen and went downstairs.  There were 3 other Asian options, a Mexican restaurant, Hero Burger, Subway and La Prep.  The seating area was pretty full, but we were able to find a spot for 4.

There was actually no line when we arrived for a late lunch.  The restaurant next to it (MR Souvlaki) had about 7 people in line, though.  They offer different soup options (chicken broth, spicy broth, vegetable broth), meats (pork wonton, shrimp wonton, BBQ pork, spicy beef,  brisket), and noodles (egg, thin rice, thick rice).  They also offer the similar dishes with rice instead of noodles.  My vegetarian friend was happy about the options here.

Lunch at Noodle King is pretty cheap!  Probably the cheapest I've been to in downtown Toronto.  

The egg noodle soup with pork wonton was about $5.  It also comes with bok choy.  Plus another $1 for a can of soda.  The noodle soup was very good!  The broth was good and they provided hot sauce if you want to spice it up.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the pork wonton were also good.

{"text":"I hate to give chinese restaurant low rate. 
Look at all the chinese restaurants and massage places around. You will know they are not making money, just for survive. Too much competition. I dont know how long they can last in vegas. 
But the food and service was really not good.

Location too far away from the strip.

Food menu looks good, but the food tastes bad.  

If they have time to ask me about comment, i will ask them straight. Are you hiring chef?
Cant believe the chef(not sure if there is an real chef) cooks worse than me. Maybe the chef is on vacation.

I rely on yelp's rating during my travel. For this restaurant, i will give two star, and will not come back."}
{"text":"This place is in the the Rainbow shopping center by Buffet Asia on Rainbow and Sahara.  They've been opened for about a year.  They are super famous within the Chinese community.  All my family's friends were super excited when they saw advertising for the shop.  


The meat in the xlb was kinda gross to me.  The skin (peel on the outside) was made perfectly; not too thin and not too thick.
My mom also got some Dan Dan/Tan Tan (depending who you talk to) noodles, the beef noodle soup and roast duck.  

The Dan Dan noodles was pretty tasty.  It had lots of ingredients and a little more noodles would have been great.  All the noodles are hand pulled so they come in different sizes

Now the beef noodle soup gave my sisters boyfriend the runs bcs that was all he ate and he spent the night in the bathroom.  Then my lil niece found a piece of plastic in her duck.  She could have seriously choked bcs she loves food (a foodie like her auntie) and she just puts food in her mouth."}
{"text":"We got the beef pancakes, fuqi fei pian, shui zhu yu, tomato and egg noodles, dan dan noodles.

Let's start with the beef pancakes. Wow these were amazing. Normally I love meat, when it comes to beef wrapped in pancakes, I don't like too much. This was a perfect balance of hoisin sauce + pancake + beef. There wasn't so much meat that it drowned out everything else and the pancake itself was perfectly cooked and flavorful (esp with the hoisin sauce).

The fuqi fei pian. Normally places don't have tripe, so that was a little bit different. The tripe pieces also soaked up the sauce so if you like spicy, eat more of the tripe vs other beef parts. Very cheap and great value here.

The shui zhu yu....we couldn't finish it. They put a bunch of filets and stuff the rest with other veggies like bean sprouts and nappa cabbage. Overall the flavor was on point too.

The tomato and egg noodles. OMG the noodles quality is really good. It really feels handmade as it has that perfect inconsistency in shape and a nice chewiness to it. As for the whole noodle dish, the tomato and eggs were so saucy and really got to sticking onto the noodles. A simple yet amazing dish. Probably my favorite out of everything!

The dan dan noodles, like I said above, noodle quality is high. The rest of the toppings in the noodle dish was kind of meh though. Also not very spicy.

Service surprising really good here. Probably helps that we came in for lunch and we were 1/2 customers there :D"}

Please open up....."}
{"text":"To echo other reviews: Fast, Cheap, and Simple.

Situated in one of the smaller food courts in the PATH system, this place is a real find.

During the lunch hour, on your way to or from The Bay through the underground, it's actually easy to spot this place because there is consistently a long line-up. One sign as to whether or not a place as good is if the ethnicity of the patrons match the food that is being served. Looking at the lineup, you'll notice that it's at least 90% Asian (which may include myself).

I actually aim to be there just before noon but if you are stuck in the lineup, they efficiently have the line move along fast. So the point of getting there early is mainly so that you can get a seat in the food court.

I always order the wonton noodles and basically you just point to the kind of noodles you want, ask for scoops of spicy broth if you want and then choose between pork or shrimp wontons. They also have rice dishes with BBQ pork, and chicken and sides of fried dumplings.

The prices have gone up slowly over the years but you can get away with a good meal for under $6 unless you buy a drink."}
{"text":"Very delicious! Worth to try! The yunan noodles soup is authentic and the chongqing xiaomian is little bit specific, they also have hot pot , should try next time."}
{"text":"Great noodles, fast and delicious.  The most efficient line-up, I've experienced.  Be ready to order when you get to the front, or else you're holding up everyone else. 

I usually order spicy beef, with less spicy broth, and it's perfect.  The chunks of beef are generous, and noodles always perfectly done (I prefer the thick egg noodles) with this dish.  It wouldn't hurt to give us a tad more veggies, but for the price, product and location, it's very reasonable. 

When I'm feeling more frugal, I like the roasted chicken noodle with broth and thin egg noodles."}
{"text":"I really don't like to give reviews like this, but when you have 2 kids going to the bathroom all day..it's a must.  First of all, the service is a little too slow for my liking. Hard to understand the waitresses,  so ordering took a bit. (Not being mean here. As a fellow Asian, when you can't understand, it's a pretty thick accent) The food came out very quickly,  and it looked pretty good.  We ordered 2 different types of noodle soup,  mushroom pork and beef. Both were very oily,  but the tsste was good. 
The dan dan noodles were oily also,  and there were so many little peppercorns that made it unpleasant to eat.  Also ordered the cabbage noodle chow fun and green onion pancakes. Both were just ok. 
Thought the meal was decent, but the next day both kids went to the bathroom way to many times.  They ate the noodle soups, so I'm not sure if the broth was too oily for them. We ate there on a Sunday night, and they finally recovered from stomach pains and unpleasant bathroom trips on Tuesday."}
{"text":"It's aiiiiite.  Great value but quality isn't really there and you pretty much get what you pay for.  i'd still go back since i work downtown and it's impossible to find chinese noodle houses unless you take your journey out to China Town."}
{"text":"This place is great. I've always searched for noodle joints around the valley and this one wasn't too far from the hut. Got in, ordered the spicy beef noodle and it came out within minutes. Price is reasonable as well. 

Waitress wasn't attentive as they should. My water glass stayed empty for a good 10 minutes until I had to request for some water. Mind you there is only myself as the actual customer in the place. 

The spicy beef noodle was a huge portion. So good I can go for another. Other than the lack of hospitality, this place gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is such a gem! Great location, plenty of parking. We got a groupon, and this place is definitely on our go-to casual restaurant rotation. Groupons are hit or miss (often miss), but this place is absolutely worth every full-price penny! 

The atmosphere is simple, but very clean. The service was sooooo fast. The place is family owned. Everyone is really warm and attentive, and will explain everything on the menu. 

I had the Chongqing Street Noodle Soup . I highly reccommend this! Definitely err on the side of mild if you can't stand much heat (like me). Mild is still flavorfully spice!"}
{"text":"We ordered the green onion pancake, beef noodle soup and chicken in a dry pot.  Our waitress dd not speak English and brought an order of hot & soup soup in addition to the items we ordered. We had asked if the hot & sour contained pork - a gentleman came over and said it does, however he could make it without pork.  We went with the beef noodle received both.

The green onion pancake had little flavor and was so greasy, the plate it came on was full of oil.  The hot & sour soup tasted bland.  The beef noodle was full of fatty bits of beef which made it very unappetizing. The broth and veggies were eh...  The highlight was the chicken, which sizzled when it was brought to our table and became crispy on the bottom layer from the hot dry pot.  It was seasoned well and the vegetables contained within the dish were plentiful."}
{"text":"When you walk into Noodle King, the first thing you notice is the smell.  It smells like a mixture of herbal products you can't quite put a name on (to me, it smells like a traditional Chinese medicine store). I am actually giving this place 3.5 stars.  The service is pretty standard for a Chinese restaurant but the hand made noodle is what makes this place so unique (and the portion size is ginormous)!  The spicy beef stew comes with a lot and I really mean A LOT of chili oil so if you aren't into that, go for the standard braised beef stew and add your own chili paste/oil that is on the table to it.  Either way, the broth is pretty tasty.  And if you're looking for appetizers, I recommend the beef pancake roll."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever given a 5 for a food court restaurant..
I can see why it's popular, plus it's funny there are 2 asian restaurants side by side; one clearly outdoing the other...
The service was really friendly, I went at off peak (probably best when you see the lines online, I imagine it moves fairly quickly..).
Good lunch for under 10 bucks, rare."}

I got the BBQ chicken leg noodle and added BBQ pork. Soo good! Looking forward to trying other dishes!"}

I might give them another chance by ordering something else next time, but I would not recommend their beef noodle."}
{"text":"There are three words to describe a typical experience with a meal at Noodle King.

Fast, Cheap & Customized

The Noodle King is located in the nether regions of the PATH in the food court of the Sheraton Centre. During lunch time, it is a common sight to see a never ending stream of office workers lining up for their fix.

Part of the appeal for Noodle King is that the staff is quick, efficient and customizes your order to your choosing. 

Off the top of my head, these are the options for noodles. 
Broth: Chicken, Spicy, Vegetable
Meats: Pork wonton, Shrimp wonton, BBQ pork, Spicy Beef,  Soy Chicken Leg, Brisket
Noodles: Egg, Vermicelli, Thick Rice Noodles

*Vegetable is given with each bowl and it is usually bok choy

Customization here is endless and you could end up eating here each time with a different creation of your own. They got customization down pat. Pricing will vary with the choices though. 

The affordability here is bar none compared to places in the PATH. It is one of the cheapest with a bowl of pork wonton soup noodles costing around  $5. 

With lunch options in the PATH becoming more and more expensive, I find myself coming here more often than not. I do recommend you to come here for lunch. Your tummy and especially your wallet will be grateful."}
{"text":"This place has the best Asian comfort food I've found in dt yet. Their shrimp wanton noodles are great and I've tried their BBQ chicken too, also delicious. The prices are more uptown prices than downtown, so it's cheaper than most food courts nearby. I try to come here every week or so.

Avoid peak times but if you see a long line, it moves fast. It's also open during the weekend which is great."}
{"text":"This place is crazy tasty!!!!!!!
I CANT believe there's THIS good of a Yunnan restuarant in LV!

I'm soooo glad we found this place since we were traveling with chinese relatives and they would die to have some chinese food in LV...and luckily we found one on yelp!
Get the LAMB! Everything with LAMB is soooo good! They make the lambs really good, but the QUALITY of the lamb is also the best!
Really wish they had something like this in OC, I would go everyday!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Chinese noodle places, that isn't in China town. Noodle king also caters to your traditional American Chinese food too, but excels in its noodles. Some serious big portions, soups will feed two and the lunch specials are excellent too. The spicy dishes are really good, but they are super spicy so be careful. For 5 people, we ordered 2 soups, beef rolls and a fish lunch special, the bill was around $30. You can't beat that!!! If you like noodles, you really need to try this place."}
{"text":"Noodle King is located in an out-dated but clean food court near Sheraton Centre Toronto inside the Path.

I was a bit disappointed when my colleague highly recommends their spicy beef noodle to me.  There were four types of noodles you can choose from.  I had the slim egg noodle.  The noodle was cooked just right, not too chewy nor too soft.  The soup base was ok with a medium level of spicy which was perfect for me as I don't like my broth too spicy.  The beef, however, was not as tender and the taste was a bit bland.  

After tax, it came to $9.05 I paid in cash.  I know it is in downtown, but I would say it is just a so so for the price.  

Will I go back?  I will when I am craving for egg noodle on a work day in downtown."}

Spicy Beef Brisket on noodles

I got the rice noodle in hot and sour soup. It was flavorful with just the perfect amount of spices. It is hard to explain, you'll have to taste it yourself because of how unique it is. My sister got the braised beef noodle soup and she said the broth was also flavorful and not too salty. The beef was tender and melts on your tongue. Both dishes came with a generous amount of vegetables. 

Their service was amazing, they were attentive, and the food came out fast. No complaints here."}

It's the smallest crappiest food court that one could imagine. I think there are 5 stalls. A subway, hero burger, a random Greek place and another place I can't remember. Then there's this place. 

Family run joint service up awesome bowls of noodle soup and other dishes. 

I only have ordered the vegetarian noodle soup (with egg noodles - my fave). Firstly, it's a huge portion with lots of veggies. Secondly it is loaded with veggies and fresh tofu. Thirdly it's cheap. $6 for a humongous portion. Fourthly it's very flavourful. Fifthly, the owners are really nice. Sixthly, there's no wait. Seventhly the broth is absolutely delicious. Eighthly, you should check out this hidden gem. 

I always love finding hole in the ground (literally) pleases that serve up amazing food at cheap prices to only those that know about it. 

Go eat here."}
{"text":"Yikes... looking at the yelp pics  I was so excited.  Drove there with my mouth watering in anticipation of some spicy, oily, flavorful noodles...but as I got into the parking I saw that there was no sign above the store front... just blackness where the Noodle King sign should have been... what's going on? I  did see the neon open sign in the widow so we went in.  The lights then came on and people arose from the booths.  No not Michael Jackson's Thriller part deux.  Instead,  a replacement restaurant and nap time for employees... although we arrived at 5:45 pm so I'm surprised they were napping. 

Since this appeared to be a Sichuan place,  we ordered the Dan Dan Mein and the Yu Xiang Rou Shi (Fish Scented Pork... but don't worry my friends,  no fish scent at all.  If done right,  my  favorite chinese dish. The only reason it's not yours is because your haven't had it in a true Sichuan restaurant. Sometimes it's called shredded pork with garlic sauce)

With great anticipation I waited for our food.  When the Dan Dan noodles came,  I was very surprised to find out it was delivered by Pei Wei.  I actually like Pei Wei,  but wasn't expecting it.  Tasted just like it. The Pork dish was good.  Tasted nothing like how Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce should have tasted though.   But in their defense it was shredded pork and there was garlic in the sauce. 

The hot sauce there is REALLY good.  I doused the food with it.  Very flavorful. 

Service was also very friendly"}

I had their Spicy Beef with vermicelli noodles. The soup had big chunks of tender beef, bok choy, plenty o' noodles and a beef broth that had loads of chilli flakes swimming in it. For a one size, big bowl of noodles, it cost me $5.99. Noodle King is super cheap!

There is a line up during the busy lunch rush but it moves so quickly that you won't even notice that you're even waiting for food. Noodle King is like a well-oiled machine; they churn out noodle dishes one right after the other that you'll be slurping your noodle soup in no time."}

{"text":"Unfortunately, not particularly sanitary in the kitchen; you risk food poisoning.  (Amended review a few hours later when symptoms were obvious. Ugh. Never again.)

I feel misled by Yelp here; the reason there are so many 4 and 5 star reviews is diners were offered discounts or free items if they posted positive reviews.

Otherwise: Reasonable Chinese food (apparently specializing in Yunnan at some point, more noodles now, but most common dishes as well), and inexpensive lunch combos.  Nice location, well decorated and comfortable.  Staff were friendly but not very attentive, even when there were only a few guests.  The thing which scares me is the C rating with the health department, and appearing on the news as a dirty dining option; couldn't see into the kitchen, but while the dining area and food appeared fine, it is hard to tell what goes on in the back.  Without that concern, would be a solid 3.

(EDITED: dropped it down to 1 star because a few hours after eating here, I had (have) all the symptoms of food poisoning.  Ugh.)"}
{"text":"This restaurant gives large portions and isn't overly salty. The waitress is very friendly and keeps bringing over napkins. The place is pretty slow at the moment, it may be due to the isolated location but it really should get more credit for its food."}
{"text":"Great food court place for noodles. The Sheraton Centre is a bit rundown, but however it's worth coming for this place! Despite the lines, they are very very fast.

Spicy beef noodles are probably their signature item. Has great flavour, however it's very spicy, it'd be a good idea to skip the sauce!

Used to be decently priced but now I find it a bit more expensive, especially for the beef."}
{"text":"Definitely a good find in the most unlikely place in the path. It is depressing location as most of the PATH has been renovated but the food is very good and inexpensive. They have a variety of choices in the menu."}
{"text":"Solid lunch choice for nearby. Their spicy beef noodle is delicious. Really great flavouring and soup. Choice of different noodles (awesome) and a good price considering the area. I've also had their wonton noodles, which is as good as any i've had.

I come here often.

4 stars out of 4.

Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:
[*] Disappointing. Just...no. 
[**] Not very good. Will not return. 
[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. 
[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. 
[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Went here based on reviews and was not disappointed. Place was empty for dinner with one other table occupied. Food was really good with home made noodles. Service was slow and the server never once checked on me after ordering. Only came by to drop off my food."}
{"text":"Solid lunch take-away spot for cheap wonton noodle soup. The only minus about this place is you would have to eat it in a grime-y food court. You can take-away but it's a bit hard to slurp noodle soup at your desk. You get your choice of noodles and meat to go in your soup. I've had the pork wonton soup paired with wonton noodles, and for under $5, felt very satisfied with my meal. Part of my Finance District lunch time rotation!"}
{"text":"Looks sketchy at first in a run down food court but packed during lunch hours. Line moves quickly, but expect at least 15mins wait during peak hours.
Great value for authentic Chinese soup noodles. I had Asian beef meatballs with Shang Hai noodles. Meatballs were spot on, just enough tendon to give it that authentic bite (\"springiness\" as referred yo by locals). Noodles were a touch overcooked for my taste. Soup was fragrant and light, not too flavourful but serves as a nice backdrop. Portion was on the smaller end but not bad for its price in the area.
Take away - Would definitely come back to try other items, which won't be a challenge given the price point and location. But if this was it a more Chinese area like Scarborough, Markham or Richmond Hill with plenty of competitors, Noodle King probably will rank low on my go to list. But having this so close to the financial district makes it a wonderful lunch spot when you crave some real Chinese food."}
{"text":"???is a very famous restaurant brand in Hong Kong/ China. One of my friend told me the head chef is now open a small local restaurant here in Vegas. My mom was so excited and can't wait to go try. We were there on Mother's Day. 7:30pm with no guests.... two servers 2 out of 5 dinner entrees were sold out .... really ?? Then we decide to order few appetizers to check on the quality before we moved on. After we ordered, the two servers disappeared, all I heard were them talking in the kitchen about how to cook ( in Mandarin ). My family and I looked at each other and knowing that we may need to look for another restaurant for dinner. Lol 
Not surprising, only the green onion pancake can consider up to standard. 
Pan Fried Pork Bun ??? ---- pork raw inside ?????
Chicken with Spicy Sauce ???---the texture of the chicken is not even taste like chicken ?????????
Sliced pork with garlic ????---can only taste the garlic ???????????
Really disappointed! Destroy all reputations built."}
{"text":"Noodle king is located in the depressing dungeon looking food court in the Path (If its your first time going, you'll know when you've arrived). While all other buildings are renovating to make their food courts look nicer, this food court looks like it has not changed for decades. 

Noodle King has the longest line in the food court and the you'll see the most asians in a food court in all of the Path. Its basically the chipotle idea of fast food before chipotle. Pick your noodle, pick your toppings and go. 

I've tried various noodles and my favorite is still the egg noodles. Wontons are my favorite topping. The cha-sui, roast duck and roast chicken are all a bit sub-par. Its not bad considering youre paying $6-$7 for lunch, but really not that great. 

The man who makes the noodles every day is somewhat of a legend. He times everything by feel and works very quickly, multi-tasking multiple orders at once. Hes provides quick, but friendly service and is still nice to new customers who come undecided even after waiting in line for 10 minutes. The \"topping\" ladies are not so nice but is expected."}
{"text":"Very good food excellent taste highly recommend little secret spot! Try the street style noodles very delicious"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem! This place is my go to when I crave noodles on a work day. The place is run by a Chinese family and they serve both rice and noodles. I have tried their vermicelli with BBQ pork, fish balls, shrimp wontons, pork wontons, and BBQ chicken (with bones) (almost everything haha). My favourites are the pork wontons and shrimp wontons. The portion is pretty big and the price is very reasonable for downtown Toronto. Should definitely give it a try if you work around the area."}
{"text":"My office got their menu through the mail and it advertised free delivery.  As it turns out, they don't really do delivery, but it's okay.  Less than a mile away from my office.  

The shopping center this restaurant is located in is huge; they are behind that Asian bank facing Sahara.  The decor inside was nice and clean.  It is definitely more quiet than most Chinese restaurants you will find on Spring Mountain. 

They offer a pretty extensive lunch specials menu. We had the twice cooked pork and the pork with garlic sauce (traditional Beijing dishes).  Right portion size for its price.  It was actually very authentic.  The spiciness was perfect. It came with soup, salad and egg rolls. 

I am so adding this restaurant to our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Do not believe all the high rating reviews. The food was quite below the average. Noodles felt like rubber and the vegetables tasted very \"old\". Service was OK but they took 10 mins to get my Groupon coupon redeemed, and another 5 mins to get the credit card machine working. Overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"If you are going to have authentic Chinese dishes in Las Vegas, here is just right place than any other restaurants!!!!"}
{"text":"The outside of the restaurant is named Noodle King but everything inside says Yun Nan Cuisine. Odd. 

Last week we tried eating here but we were turned away because of too many people which was funny because the restaurant was empty. 

 But we wanted to give them another try so we went tonight after work. The service started friendly and ended with me just getting up and requesting a check because no ever came back to the table to check on us. 

We ordered orange chicken, house fried rice and house lo mein.  The orange chicken was small but good. I wasn't  prepared for the rest of my meal because I didn't expect in a million years for their to be hot dog in my fried rice and lo mein. CHOPPED UP HOTDOG!!! 

I won't be going back but if you like hotdogs go ahead and try them."}
{"text":"I loved noodle from this place. Especially when I was tired of all these fancy overpriced lunch options in downtown.

This is place right for you if you:

Like noodle soup 
Noodle
Wonton - shrimp, pork etc
BBQ chicken - moist
Cheap price $6-$7?
Etc? 

There will be long line up if you go there during the lunch time. I found that after 2pm seems to be pretty easy. -in case you are flexible with lunch time-

Hope someone else enjoy this place like me.

Thank you for reading my sloppy writing ;)"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem this place is.  Noodle King serves schezuan food from northern china that includes soup dumplings, beef pancake, and spicy noodles and meats.  Their noodles are hand-pulled and have a wonderful light chewy texture.  Everything is really flavorful and the prices are lower than like restaurants.  

I came here and tried their soup dumplings (xiao long bao), beef pancake, and dan dan noodles.  I loved all three dishes.  The soup dumplings came piping hot and plump with soup inside.  The beef pancake had a really crispy outer onion pancake which wrapped non-chewy flavorful beef.  The dan dan noodles were really flavorful and I love the tender baby spinach they add in it to make it slightly more healthy.  The noodles are hand pulled and extremely fresh.  

Tip:  This place is super authentic so most workers don't speak English.  If you don't speak mandarin, come in and use your fingers and hold up the number of people in your party so they can seat you.  The menu has English as well so just point to what you want.  They offer you tea or water and that in english they can understand."}
{"text":"This is a new place, though far from the strip, but the taste is really good! ?????? ???? ??????"}
{"text":"It is open today!!!!! On Thanksgivings day! 
Yunan noodles are really delicious!! I love this place. Owners are so nice and give us a free appetizer."}
{"text":"This place has really authentic asian cuisine now.  It used to be a yunan restaurant which I disliked.   The place also used to have a funky smell, it's still kind of there but the great food makes up for it.  I only tried the sechuan beef noodles today, but i'll be back to try some of the dinner cuisines.  It's spicy and the flavor is great.

I read some reviews on dirtyness and stuff like that.  I don't know, didn't experience that yet, honest it doesn't look like the cleanest of all joints, but theres a running asian joke.  That's part of the authenticity!    The dirtier it is the tastier food.  No, seriously.  =)"}
{"text":"Great food!Everything is hand made on spot!The girls are very friendly,little language barrier but try their best to be helpful!"}
{"text":"Reasonable price. Many noodles choices, broth is tasty, meat is delicous. There is a reason why it has the longest lineup in the same foodcourt."}
{"text":"Beef and fish over cooked... Not enough spicy... Noodle are not will cooked... Over all food taste ok... No surprise ..
And Also they will force you to give them 5 stars and writing 50 words good review for them before getting the 15%off after checking on yelp... No wonder they having 4 half stars over all..."}
{"text":"Four stars, zero for ambiance. 

Located in a depressing underground food court, you would be forgiven for walking by Noodle King as you meander through Toronto's PATH. Surrounded by dank chain resto stalls, you might chalk up long lunchtime lines to a lack of affordable options narby. 

Noodle King is definitely affordable, and the food's pretty swell, too.

The menu is limited to Chinese lunch staples; proteins including great char siu, chicken and your choice of wonton, served over noodles'n'broth or alongside steamed rice and blanched veg. 

My usual is a bowl of soup with egg noodles, wontons (pork or shrimp) and some of that glorious red-dyed pork. I reach for the chili oil, but those in the know (and with a sweeter tooth than mine) may opt for the \"spicy sauce\", a thing I didn't even know about until someone behind me in line ordered it. 

If I'm starving (which i usually am), I'll add a spring roll. Tasty if I catch it when it's really hot; kinda sludgy otherwise. 

Still, for under $10 it's tough to go wrong."}
{"text":"I like this place's food, espiciall the fish stockpots with pickeled cabbage was bery special and tasty, the house special Yun Nan rice noodle is a must try. I find the food are not oily compare with many other places. Don't forget to try their appetizer spicy Beef cold plate. come try and you'll enjoy this farely new restaurant !!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, easy to find, clean environment. The owner prepares customized water and tea. Dishes come with large amount, enough for more than u think!! We had a Sichuan style boiling food with special hot sauce (vegetable and meat), and it was enough for 3 person. The plate comes with well mixed and balanced meat and vegetables. If u are not a big fan of spicy food, ask for less spicy, and they can make it a little sweet. Would recommend. Worth the price. Also, the price is affordable, actually not expensive compare to other restaurant. 2 for about 25 makes a really good meal."}
{"text":"If we wanna stay away from the busy Chinatown on the weekend dinner hours, we always end up there.

Don't let the restaurant name fooled you, they got more than noodles choices to offer.

We tried to order different food every time, and so far nothing has disappointed us!  Food are delicious and authentic.  I love their portion is medium size and price is good, which means we can order more food! Yay!!

Our family favs were the spicy pork belly, roasted duck, roasted beef pancake, dan dan noodles, etc...

Chef gave us complimentary steamed bun during our last visit, omg, that was the bomb! It was a good size steamed bun (like the size of my hand), when i bit into it, there was JUICE leaking out! watch out for the juice it may explode on your first bite!  Ended up we got 10 more to go, however, there wasn't juice leaked out even thou we followed the re-heating instruction.  Well, still a good bun!

BTW, the menu from the photo gallery belongs to the old restaurant.  It is not the same menu!"}
{"text":"Soggy noodles, I ordered 2 different kinds of noodles, and couldn't tell which was which. I had to beg for a spoon so I can eat my noodle soup. I don't think I'll go back there again."}
{"text":"When conferencing downtown, either at the Hilton on Richmond or anywhere else in that area, this humble foodcourt noodlery is the place to go for MSG-laden Wonton Noodle soup.  Situated in an 80s-era foodcourt under the Sherton, this can't be beat.  Always room to sit down."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here a bit ago to try them out during dinner. It was pretty empty in the restaurant when we went so the service was really good. They were quick to take orders down. 

We ordered their spicy duck gizzard, cold spicy noodle, Chongqing street noodle soup, fish and tofu special, and their lamb pot. We ordered each at either medium or hot spicy. 

Everything looked great. However, the taste was way off. Why? There was no taste. Aside from the spiciness, there is literally no depth to any of the dishes we've tried. 

The tofu and fish special and the lamb pot were in huge pots. It looks big but it's not as big as you may think. They pretty much steamed the food and them pour a spicy chili oil on top. There wasn't much flavor to the dish aside from that. If they had cooked it in a sauce, it would've been better. The Chongqing street noodle also lacks some flavor .. or perhaps some MSG. The spicy cold noodle dish is decent.

I probably won't come here to dine again. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Love this little gem in the Financial District.  A coworker took me here when we were talking about food and how I missed eating shrimp wonton in Central, Hong Kong.  Not the same but still very very delicious!  $5.77 gets you a bowl of 5 shrimp wonton, Veg and Soup--not too shabby for the core.

I have tried their beef brisket with Ho Fun noodles and that was delicious too.  The boss is a Chinese man who sits there and takes your order, very nice man.  I don't speak Chinese and very comfortable ordering.  It is my go to for my team twice a week!  My team is predominantly vegetarian so they normally get vegetables and noodle soup and they absolutely love it!

Highly recommend for a simple cheap lunch!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with group of friends around lunch time with the price for lunch special and with the amount of food for a great price. I would definitely recommend this place. I definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I have been in Las Vegas for almost 2 years and have eaten at several Asian restaurants. However, we just haven't up to now found that one Chinese restaurant that knocked our socks off! It's certainly not a first date place, I don't think they serve alcohol, but the food is off the charts, plentiful, fresh, delicious, scrumptious and unbelievably reasonable. We started with steamed pork dumplings and they were the best I've ever had, I'm sure they make them there homemade. We had a hot and sour soup which is something I don't usually order because it's typically a concoction, it was killer. We had a friend join us and we ordered string beans and pork, salt and pepper shrimp, this scallion pancake that had great crunchy texture and finally, this dry fish dish with jalapeños an onions all soooo fantastically good. The service quick and the ladies were sweet. There is one caveat, they speak verrrrrry little English. Fortunately, their menu has great pictures and pretty descriptive. It's pretty much a point and select scenario. I made for an interesting and fun time"}
{"text":"Food here are very good but the waiting for the food to come out is at least 15-20min per dish. The Waitess doesn't speak English. This place is cater to old Chinese folks."}
{"text":"Located on The Path at the Sheraton Centre in a small food court this noodle shop offers flavorful food at reasonable prices. I have eaten here several times during trips to Toronto and the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Great place. Service is good. The food gets the authentic taste from China. The Sichuan boiled vegetables which I got was delicious! Since I love the spicy ones, I have ordered the fresh fruit smoothie & it is recommended by my friend. She loves it! So do I!( ^ ^ )"}
{"text":"the taste was ok at beginning until i found two small flies in my soup. disgusting?? never going back. a big disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummmmm, just plain yum!    Unassuming place just off the Spring Mountain Chinese restaurant barrage.   These people know noodles.  The Dan-Dan noodles were spot on.   The beef noodle soup was full of flavor and was free of MSG.  The third member of our group ordered a curry noodle dish that was also amazing.  

We all shared a starter of soup dumplings which were quite tasty and piping hot.   We scarfed them down pretty darn fast.  The whole bill was less than 50 bucks and we all left satisfied.  

We will darken the door of this little gem again."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. Came to the restaurant with the wife and kids. We ordered few items. And only the beef noodle soup I thought  was pretty good; broth had nice flavor and noodle had great texture but everything else just average at best.
The soup dumplings were the worst item. My kids love soup dumplings but at this visit no one asked for the remaining dumplings after they finished their first one. The meat inside the dumplings were dry and lack of flavor.
The beef pancake was just okay.
The Szechuan beef with spicy sauce was spicy enough but also lack of flavor."}
{"text":"I had the wonton soup and it was just ok. The soup wasn't hot enough and there were too much pork inside the wontons. I felt sick after I walked back to the office...  ( I get sick easily from Chinese)."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  Simply delicious!  If you like a more authentic flavor and good portions, this is the place.  I don't often like Chinese food and this place is a gem!  If you are eclectic in your taste, then this is the place to visit.  The Tofu and mushroom Noodle soup was amazing, as well as the Hot Pot, the best and heathy!!!  My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"The food is hit n miss, sometimes it's really good and tasty, other times it is bland. Service is not great, once they get 80% full the wait staff forgets to check back with other tables. This new trend of original Chinese cuisine can be found at a better restaurant called Yunnan Garden so check it out."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Chinese restaurant Shanghainese cuisine in all of Vegas, and also the best non Casino Chinese restaurant non Szechuan in Las Vegas.  Their signature dishes unfortunately for those who don't know the history of this restaurant which used to be a legend in Shanghai in the 1940s and in Hong Kong in the 60s, are still available mostly but off the menu.  But if you are lucky and find the lender cooking in the restaurant when u you are visiting you can ask him for suggestions and order then if you wish with a 24 hours notice.  I know of 3 dishes like that which are EXCELLENT.  the sautéed shrimp medium sized, the fish had soup in a clay pot and the \"tee bon\", or pork leg which is fall off the bones tender and extremely succulent and tasty. 
All this on top of all the other regular menu items and the best red braised beef noodle soup in town and one of the 2 best dang fan noodles in town.  I highly recommend you run to go eat here if you have not tried it before yet and you will not be disappointed! But it's indeed genuine Shanghainese Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Not a bad food court restaurant. Enjoyed a bowl of spicy beef with your pick of one of three different types of noodles.

Accepts debit or cash only.

Edit: After eating here a few times. I actually like it. Pretty decent.. And good for a restaurant in the PATH! I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Been here too many times to count. My girlfriend LOVES the juicy pork dumplings and the hand pulled noodles. Everything is fresh and has an authentic taste of Chinese cuisine. Couldn't be more happier to dine here after a crazy weekend on the strip (btw we are not Vegas locals, we should be though!) My favorite is the pan fried pork dumplings, they are enormous. All the portions are huge here and the prices are cheap. 

The staff is friendly and attentive, refiling our waters/tea and making sure we have enough napkins for the mess that we make savouring the delicious food. 

Decor is nice, great open space, booths are comfortable. Restrooms are clean, they even have an authentic Chinese wooden chair from like 800b.c. (just kidding) 

Vegas has it's hidden gems, this is by far the best one."}
{"text":"Good portion size for the price, taste is what you'd expect for the price.

The main downside is how there's no place to dump the leftover soup (water). Since this is in a mall food court, you end up having to pour the soup into the trash, and makes it a tough time for the cleaners."}
{"text":"Quick, delicious, and super affordable! I legit come here every other day for lunch during the week because I work so close by.

A warm hearty bowl of Ramen soup and noodles is perfect for the cold fall/winter weather. And they do not cheap out on the meat slices. I have gotten every type so far, and my favourite is the BBQ pork. It comes out to under $8 for a great meal! If your are still hungry, they have dimsum dishes that can finish you off like dumplings and spring rolls!

This place is a blessing and idk how I'd survive here!

{"text":"The place is at the Sheraton's food court in the concourse level. So glad I read the previous reviews and gave it a try... you will not be disappointed. 
The wontons are so good. I tried the shrimp and ordered one piece of the pork wonton to try. They both were amazing!  I'm so cautious to order dumplings because they look/taste like mystery meat but not here. These dumplings are so tasty and good quality filling."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and new , very authentic Chongqin spicy style noodle dishes , I'm glad I found this place , will be back soon for sure !!! Trey serve hot pot as well!!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot out and was disappointed. Service was mediocre. We didn't get dinner plates jut ate of their tiny app plates. Had to ask a few times for our hot tea, asked for a soup but got noodles instead. Had to. It a bowl of soup since the noodles he already come out. (We ordered them thinking it was a soup, waitress didn't tell us it wasn't). 
Dan dan noodles had a very weird flavor and made your mouth go numb."}
{"text":"I'm glad to find this place on some authentic Szechuan food.. This is their second place from NYC. Really spicy and tasty. Love it"}
{"text":"fantastic service here! super fast. Long line ups for lunch, ALWAYS

It's $0.30 debit fee, or cash only

Noodle King is your quick wonton noodle soup fix in the financial district area. Great portions for $5-6 ($7 for rice combos). Barbeque chicken soup noodle for just $6? Unheard of (in downtown food court)!!! I usually visit earlier (before noon) to avoid the rush. They are opened in the mornings if you need a warm breakfast!

The food is just okay in my opinion. It's not the best. The noodles were quite dull, the soup was a little dull. The barbeque chicken was pretty good given I was soooo hungry when I bought my 10:30am breakfast. It was moist, fairly large, the skin was just a tad fatty if you're into that, there wasn't much barbeque flavour on it (the sauce lightly covered the skin, but didn't reach the meat).

I've also had barbeque pork and their wontons. The barbeque pork was quite delicious! Again, a little dull but I liked it. Wontons were alright.

is it barbeque or barbecue? ahhh"}
{"text":"Holy shit. This place was amazing. We got the Dan Dan noodles and schezuan fish dry pot. The Dan Dan noodles we're spicy and chewy and carb-liscious. I loved the roasted peanuts. It was a great crunchy texture for the dish. But the star of the show was the fish. I think it was pan fried and it had a thin crunch with veggies coated in amazing sauce. I put my time in the main pot to soak up all the umami goodness!! Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Very good try.

I highly recommend everyone to go there.
We tried cold appetizer beef, and hot dish of fish.

A friendly reminder: the address is  6820 W Sahara Ave Las Vegas, NV 89146. Not in the Springs shopping center."}
{"text":"We are locals who came in after a recommendation from a friend. We were the first and only guests at 11am on a Monday and were served Re-Fried egg rolls from the night before, and a Re-Cooked soggy green bean entree. When we dared to speak up about the inside of the egg roll being Cold but the outside shell being dark brown because they had re-fried it, we got a nasty denial, and no apology for the cold center. They did not take away the dish, or give us a fresh one, or even apologize. 
We had also ordered two dumpling entrees but were told that they didn't have it ready so \"early\" in the morning.  When asked why these popular dishes weren't prepared when your restaurant opens at 11AM, the owner's daughter snapped back at my elderly mother saying, \"Do You Not understand that it takes time to prepare?!\"  Well, do YOU not understand that you own a restaurant that should have its food ready when you open?  And do YOU not understand what good and courteous service is, or how to properly treat your customers? I know it's a lot to expect good service from a Chinese restaurant but wow, these people take the cake.  Too bad, because we frequent all the popular Chinese restaurants in town and are loyal customers who spread the good word when we find a good place to eat."}
