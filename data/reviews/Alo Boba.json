Oh?Shot?This is very bad?
The boba tea does not even have boba inside but almost full ice?You can call it ice color water after it melts, the only couples bona left also taste like a stone. The quality of the cup they use also sucks, broke immediately when I looking for \"boba.\" This is a really horrible experience; snacks was just ok."}
{"text":"This boba place is weird in that it seems to be part of the same restaurant conglomeration of Pho Tempe and Papaya Thai, all sharing the same space essentially. When I walked in, there were no customers eating in the restaurant and sitting at one of the tables was a jolly youngish gentleman who was wearing all red, sporting an impressive looking ZZ Top beard and Santa hat. He greeted me, explained the menu and said that I could order from any of the three menus available from the three different businesses if I wanted. I half expected him to end each sentence with HO HO HO! but I was sadly mistaken.

I asked ZZ Top Santa if there was any minimum charge for credit cards, in which he replied \"Only $15 minimum for delivery but none for bubble tea.\" So, I looked through the menu. They have a range of milk teas, slushes, green tea, and smoothies. Boba is automatically included with each drink but you can upgrade to a jelly mix-in for $.50. ZZ Santa then said \"Ring the bell if you are ready to order\" then disappeared to the back, never to be seen again. Perhaps he had a gig at the mall to go to before heading to a bar to do a cover of \"Sharp Dressed Man.\"

Well, it took a few shakes of the bell before someone emerged from the back to take my order. I had the almond milk tea with boba. I had a seat on the very dingy looking couch in the front area while they were making the milk tea. When the drink came out it was presented in a Styrofoam cup and the server/chef(?) then showed me the receipt and asked me to pay in cash. The closest thing to cash I had were a few bits of stringy lint in the empty recesses of my wallet's pouch.

Me: \"The gentleman that greeted me told me there was no minimum for purchases.\"
Milk Tea Maiden: \"Oh he doesn't know anything. There is supposed to be $7 minimum for credit card.\" 

Hmmmm... OK. Well she did end up letting me use my credit card and the total was a little more than $4. 

The taste of the milk tea was super sweet, way too sugary for my tastes. The tea had a strange aftertaste to it. The tapioca had a good chewy texture. I couldn't really finish all of the drink though because it tasted too weird to me. 

It was a bit of a surreal experience ordering from here and the milk tea wasn't that great. Sorry guys, but I must say goodbye to 'Alo!"}
{"text":"They absolutely suck. Rude on the phone. Said they already closed the kitchen an hour early & I advised them to change the time on Yelp, but they say they are still open, but no kitchen. WTF? And they refused to answer if they used artificial flavours or if it was all natural. Never!"}
