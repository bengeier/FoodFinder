{"text":"Like this pizza shop as they do 3 different sizes of pizza. The floor looks a bit grubby but don't let that put you off, the pizzas taste great"}
{"text":"Only gets a 5 star for the fried chicken as it is amazing! They must have discovered kfc's secret recipe! Infact i think their chicken is better than kfc, with much bigger, more succulent portions and chicken breast. Oh, and the chips are delicious and coated in chip spice. Very fast delivery also."}
{"text":"Average takeaway but what makes it stand out above the others is that it is located a way from the town centre post pub idiots and closes at midnight. They do a wonderful mixed meat kebab including lamb chops and will do pizzas for your taste e.g tuna red onion and chilli. That's fresh chilli and not that 'in brine' rubbish. The only downside of this place is the delivery driver. He is not of this planet and consequently uses a sat nav to try and deliver. None of mine have ever turned up !! Ok for a steady away pizza or kebab though - but get it yourself"}
{"text":"Very nice takeaway. Great pizzas with plenty of topping. You can pay by card if you get it delivered (ask for them to send card machine)."}
