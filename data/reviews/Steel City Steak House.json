{"text":"place is okay... Love the inside very artdeco looking and feeling. Prices a bit step for what you get. I ordered the delmonico steak, it was served on cast iron. Loaded bake potato was broccoli and cheese out of a can, very let down by that."}
{"text":"Steak was cooked to perfection but our service was very poor. And the bathrooms smelled so bad and were disgusting this place is lucky it's got good cooks."}
{"text":"Today me and my wife ate here for the first and last time. Were do i start. Waitresses sitting at a table in the dinning room with their boyfriends, filet ordered medium came out bloody, porterhouse ordered medium came out well, salad with wilted lettuce, never asked either one of us for a drink refill, watched tv for one hour when a waitress changed tv without asking any customer. The only way we would ever go back is if someone new bought the place. Good luck if you go there"}
{"text":"From the outside could not tell if they were open or closed. As I stood by the door for my husband a waitress was going in did not even acknowledge my existence. Low & behold Miss Personality from the sidewalk was our waitress, Jessica. While waiting on us she acted as though it was a rough night out the night before. We were the only guests in the dining room, my 1st clue we should have went elsewhere. Smoking permitted in the bar so we couldn't sit where we wanted, strike 2. I ordered Chicken Romano $18.99 wow !!(steaks ridiculously over priced $24.99 for a 12 oz.NY strip) chicken very salty & tough. Baked potato was microwaved & then wrapped in foil to fake it was baked. It was 1/2 hard. My husband had Shrimp Alfredo said it was ok. Jessica was no where to be seen until we were finished or I would have sent mine back. She came back & said \"how WAS it\" really this is your waitstaff ?? Strike 3 & 4. Would have liked a beverage refill. Sorry Jessica $4 tip on $40 check was generous in my opinion. Never again !!! Oh & by the way tell the cook pound the chicken for the romano & it won't be tough."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. Service is very slow.  Steaks are not very good.  Have had to return both Steaks and burgers because not cooked to order.

On other hand have found lunches to be good."}
{"text":"Food and service were both great. I would have given five stars for that part. 

The problem is that they allow smoking in the bar area and the smell was terrible even though there were walls and sports separating the dining area from the bar.

UPDATE: I've heard that they no longer allow smoking. I'd like to go back and try it again now. I'll leave another review when I do"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on our first date at this location 12 yrs ago. It has changed hands and concepts several times since but has not received much in terms of updating. We dined in recently for the first time and left feeling meh about our visit. Great appetizer sampler, open faced strip steak sandwich decent, husbands filet and grilled shrimp not good. Service OK. Decided to try again now that they offer delivery and switched things up- chicken tenders dinner and fish sandwich. This might be a steak restaurant, but their fish sandwich is the best my husband and I have had in this area and we are hooked. The batter is phenomenal and beats any church around we have tried. Paired with fresh cut fries. For $9.99 you also can't beat five delicious breaded chicken tenders with fresh cut fries and soup or salad. I like the Caesar salad. They should change the name to Steel City Fish House :) There is a decent bar crowd with lots of drink specials."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences in a restaurant I've ever had. We went for breakfast. After seeing the banner hanging outside in passing a few times, we decided to stop in. The tables were sticky, the place smelled like old mop water, and the service was terribly slow. We were there for over an hour and the place was virtually empty. The food was very cafeteria like. Sadly, I believe the Sheetz across the street puts out a better breakfast lol. I can't bring myself to try them for dinner, so I cannot comment on the dinner items."}
{"text":"Very disappointed of coming here for Mother's Day. I had made reservations for 7 people. When I came in they told me they gave my table away because someone was in a wheelchair. Which was fine. Just wished they had a back up planned when Doing that or called me ahead of time. So the server told me to fit all 7 people in one booth.. I looked at her like she was freaken crazy! Then she suggested to split us up into two booths... The reason I made reservations is so we wouldn't be in this mess and I wanted my WHOLE family together to eat on Mother's Day and not half of my family! Besides the whole table situation the food was good... But I would never come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We made a reservation and arrived, only to find out that they would not honor their credit certificate. Ended up leaving without eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch at the Steel City Steakhouse multiple times...

The Pros:
Friendly servers
Hearty Portions
Clean Restaurant
Great Turkey Sandwich and steaks
Great draft beer choices 

The Bad:
Bathrooms are gross
Smoking allowed in bar
Drink prices are probably a buck higher than they should be 


Overall I will continue to eat here.  It's a nice out of the way place with friendly service and delicious food (especially steaks)."}
{"text":"We ate there on Easter Sunday. Made a resv. for 6 ppl. (not needed as there was only 2 other ppl there).  They only served a buffet, all the food was luke warm due to the sterno cans being burnt out. They had a fresh veg tray that a blonde haired older lady was re-filling from ziploc bags using her bare hands. The only positive thing I could say is that our waiter was very nice & attentive."}
{"text":"Steel city steakhouse has two personalities, and they are both fantastic. First, the dining side... if you are going to put steakhouse in your name you better be good... and they excel. Comfortable pub feel with high end steakhouse house food. They cook to order, do it correctly, service is family friendly and you begin to feel like part of the family in no time. Then there is the bar side. Live music is often available, karoke on Friday, bartenders that actually know your name (and favorite drink) and the people are all down to earth and friendly."}
{"text":"They have the best stuffed banana peppers in the area! The large fish sandwich could feed a family of 4.
Naked sweet potato was perfect!"}
{"text":"Honestly, probably one of more surprising places to grab great tasting gastropub kind of food even though it's really quite out of the way if you're residing in the city (Monroeville right before the Turnpike). You'll pay an average amount, but the amount of food you get is like mountains that will last you for days on end, if not more. I highly recommend getting the Cod Sandwich (battered fried cod is so freaking huge) 8 or 16 oz, Steak Wrap, or the Reuben. You can also either get fries or chips with each one. In general though, there is some great tasting grub here. Haven't really tried the steaks as of yet, but if I get another chance down the road, I might consider doing so. There is an eat-in section too if you'd rather avoid the bar, which can be loud depending on when you go dine."}
{"text":"We got the prime rib. It was great. They gave us plain cold white bread. A little disappointing. Over all a good meal."}
{"text":"Food was excellent,  wait staff  was friendly and  wonderful, prices were reasonable... other than acoustics, not much to complain about! We will go back!"}
{"text":"Service was poor, the waitress failed every possible rule for manners while serving our party of 7. Reaching in fornt and across the  guests to take dishware off the table that was still being used. Waitress butchered taken the orders. And failed to just be polite to us as we attempted to get her to smile. 

Food: The shrimp in out cocktail was thawed out in water, and i mean soaked in it for a while cause all the natural flavor was gone.  Pasta in both mine and my other half's meal was over cooked. The meatballs in his meal were off colored and off tasting. The shrimp in my meal was tuff and cold!!!  Family members got streaks that were over cooked, under weight, and unseasoned. Ribs were cooked right but unseasoned, it was not even a house bbq sauce on them. Chicken looked and tasted like it was microwaved.  The steak salad that was ordered the meat had more FAT then actual meat. Meals were over priced for how they came out

Drinks: they claimed to have only COKE product, but contradict themselves with having Mt Dew( which is Pepsi). 

Bathrooms: ladies if you have an issue with confined space don't even use them. The heat was cranked up so high my face was red.  Mens( per my other half) was confined and minimal privacy.

Over all we will NOT be going back. My experience was poor and will NEVER suggest this place, not even to people I don't like."}
{"text":"Prime Rib and Steak house. 
Seven PM Saturday night, we went for the Prime Rib. Waited a long time to be waited on. Put in our drink order, waited another 10 to 15 minutes. Server showed up to take our order but still missing one of our drinks.
We three ordered Prime Rib.
Ten minutes later, server came back and said she was told they are out of Prime Rib.

Had to get menus again and reorder. Shrimp Scampi and Delmonico were okay, Strip steak  was somewhat burnt. Cesar Salad was okay, and the corn chowder was okay. Roles were not bad. Steaks up on the expensive side.
Only fair service but nothing really wrong with our server per se. She was actually running around, and out of breadth. Made me nervous.

Steak and Prime Rib house with no Prime Rib on Saturday night.
Sorry we can't really go back with any faith in the system."}
{"text":"Man I just don't like this place. The service is below par and the food is not too far behind. This place is in a good location but nobody is ever here. Point is, if you deliver a solid product it doesn't matter if your establishment is in the boonies, people will flock. This place is in the Mecca of high traffic and nobody comes. That's really all you need to know. Skip this place. Do yourself a solid."}
{"text":"All around \"meh\". Dining room is small, and the wait staff is not very friendly nor attentive. I got the King Cut prime rib and it was very fatty, and not very flavorful. Wife got a sirloin which I tried, and it was overdone and again, lacked flavor. The red skinned mashed potatoes were some of the worst things I've ever tasted. This wasn't the worst steakhouse experience I've ever had, but I would not rush back here."}
{"text":"Steel City Steak House sits at the bottom of Mosside Blvd in Monroeville, across the street from Sheetz outside of Pitcarn. I really think the restaurant could do a lot better have given a better location. Being a prior restaurant owner, location is EVERYTHING. They have given a honest effort to marketing, but I have yet to be in the restaurant when the restaurant is even half full. Each time I have been to Steel City Steak House, it's been easy to pick my own seat, because it's been empty. I am only specking of the dining room, I have not been in the bar. The bar seemed a bit too dark and drab for me and I don't like the cigarette smoke vibe. There is nothing special to say about the place, neither is there anything overly negative to say. I have gone to the steak house for a steak dinner. I can't say it was great, it was eatable. It did seem to take a bit longer than usual for a steak, given that we were the only ones in the restaurant. The prices are reasonable and comparable to other restaurants in the area. The service was always friendly. We haven't had a horrible experience, but we do not have this restaurant on our restaurant rotation list. They offer coupons and discounts if you are able to find them. They do need to claim this on yelp and address some of the issues."}
{"text":"One star given because this place is NOT a steakhouse.  Maybe I would have given another star had I not been lead to believe that it wasn't just a bar with bar food.  My  strip steak was charred and not seasoned AT ALL.  It was thin and tough.  (I ordered it medium-rare and it was definately well done) All the bottled beer arrived frozen and the waitress seemed suprised that we didn't want it.  You had to pick three sides with the steak and they were all pototo based or cottage cheese or applesauce.  What?!  Who eats cottage cheese or apple sauce with a steaK?  Also (this has nothing to do with the food but I think that its relevant for atmosphere) there weren't any sideboards in the dining area.  The cash register was on a folding-like table and the waitresses purses were just stuffed underneath it.  And lest I forget, we were greeted at the door and seated by some guy  in baggy gray sweat pants and a sweatshirt. I never need to go back to this place, ever."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that seems unsure of what it really wants to be.  The decor and prices lead you to believe they want to be upscale, but the presentation of the food and the quality of the wait staff make it feel more like a diner.  For example, the water cups have ads from other local businesses on them .  Not something you'd expect based on the decor and prices.

When we entered, the hostess was on her cell phone.  After a minute or two she finally greeted us and seated us.  Then went back to her phone call.  It was LOUD in the restaurant.  It was so loud you could barely hear the person across the table from you.  When the large party left, it did improve, but noise really carries in the dining room.  

The food was tasty, steaks done correctly and juicy and flavorful.  The plating was very basic.  Overall an enjoyable experience.  

If you use the coupon from Enjoy, this is a great value.  If not, I find it to be overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I've been to the bar section here a couple of times now, because it's convenient to a friend's house and they do karaoke.  Here are my thoughts.

The cool:
Prices are low-ish.
They have this old historical bar setup from way back in the early 1900s.  
The food is pretty tasty.  Not haute cuisine, but not bad at all.

The lame:
Sometimes it takes a while to get food.  
One time, our server was a little bit \"durrrrrr.\"  But nice enough.
Location: It's convenient to a friend's house, and nothing else in my life."}
{"text":"I gotta say I don't understand all the bad reviews, except perhaps this place needs to get it together. We went last night for dinner. They have an  extensive amount of woodwork inside, it reminds me of being in  a 1920s cigar bar.. and they have no windows. Beautiful wood, mirrors and stained glass.  A bit dark, it has potential of being a lovely place but in its present state it needs some work. It also is confused, is it a sports bar or wanna be upscale restaurant... who knows.

The staff was friendly but it took a long time for anything.

Hubby order the barbecue chicken and I had the mushroom burger. First and foremost the burger was not a frozen patty it was real meat. And it was delicious, cooked perfectly with fresh cooked mushrooms. 

Hubby also enjoyed his barbecue chicken although the sauce could have used just a little extra something.

We had a nice dinner reasonably priced all though some of their dinners were much more expensive than needed to be considering the surroundings and their staff was very friendly but  they could use a little more work starting with not hanging out in the parking lot smoking,  not sure why everything took so long. We ourselves had a nice dinner I did see other people have some issues between using some type of coupon online thing to how their food was prepared.

My best advice would be if they could just do something to make sure that every guest has a similar experience as ours and if they stayed consistent with that, this would be a great place."}
{"text":"Had dinner reservations for 12 at 5:30 on a Sunday. Obviously someone there forgot to write this down (verified no res.in the book) but the place was empty so no problem moving tables together. Atmosphere is typical bar like but nice. Ladies room has a lot to be desired. As for food. Many of us got steaks. Cooked perfect but no flavor at all. But serving sizes on all the order were HUGE! You won't leave there hungry! Small fish sandwich was sooo big it could feed two easily. Hot turkey sandwich HUGE! Onion rings were huge and very good. All in all very good food. A little pricey but you do get your monies worth. Great service and very nice waitresses."}
{"text":"Went there 3 times and that is it. Thought we would give it another chance. 3 was too many! Steaks were fatty and burnt on the outside, raw on the inside! Chicken tenders for my kids were burnt!! Mixed vegetables were frozen mixed vegetables from the freezer section of the grocery store! Over priced! Would not recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Food is very good prices r reasonable. Had a chicken salad with fresh breaded chicken and freshly cut frys best I've had in a very long time"}
{"text":"Nestled in the bottom of the valley between Monroeville and Route 30 is a study in contrast called the Steel City Steakhouse. The bar, with its intricate woodwork, impressive overhead lighting system and vast liquor selection beautifully displayed takes on the initial persona of a classy black tie establishment. But that's where it ends. The juke box is blaring classic rock at just a little too loud of volume (with no dance floor), a solo folk guitarist is setting up for a Saturday night performance, the beer selection was mostly domestics with very few craft beers to choose from and the cigarette smell hits you in the face as soon as you walk in. Am I in a ritz gone wild joint?

The service is a study in contrast as well.  My girlfriend and I were greeted almost immediately with a smile. We promptly got drinks and a menu then were left as if forgotten for about a half hour till the bar maid remember to come over to cheerfully take our order.  About another thirty minutes passed until the food came.

The menu itself doesn't appear to be able to make up its mind what kind of establishment this is. You can get steak, ribs, pasta, chicken, seafood, etc . ranging in price between $18 to $28.  Or you can get your standard burger, hoagie or sandwich for under $10

I ordered the chicken parm and spaghetti and my date ordered a half slab of ribs with red skinned mashed potatoes. I must admit though that the food was delicious! The sauce that came with my meal was very flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. The half slab of ribs that my girl ordered was about the size that you would expect if you ordered a full rack  and it was fall of the bone delightful.

All in all I like this place. I just wish it could make up its mind what it wants to be."}
{"text":"The entrees were surprisingly good.   The steaks were cooked to order and were of good quality.  The wait staff was young and inexperienced.  Well decorated place.  Dessert was not worth it -- cheap ice cream,  store bought cake."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of 5 adults and 7 girls from a basketball team.  My wife asked for the Pittsburger ( slaw & ff on top) and to please have it very well done....... It came out medium with a lot of pink.  3 of the girls ordered the grilled chicken bacon ranch sandwich and all 3 were pink in the middle  and another had a plain burger and it was also very pink.  Do they not know how to cook here?   The fries were good and my Philly steak was good.  There was no excuse, Sunday afternoon and they weren't busy or rushed to get the food out..... Just incompetent."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night. I had been there about 10 years earlier when it was called The Gold Rush. The decor isn't as nice, but the food was much better. 
We started with the spinach and feta dip, which was served with warm pita slices instead of chips. The dip was a cream cheese base rather than a cheese base (according to my wife.) It was great. Didn't think I'd like the pita as much as I did. Very good. For dinner I had a cheeseburger and fries and my wife had the Reuben. Both were solid dishes. Pretty much what you'd expect for the price and from the description. The difference - and about the only thing that separates one sandwich from another - was the bread. The bun for my burger and the marble rye on my wife's Reuben were UNBELIEVABLY fresh! So surprised. Excellent meal, worth every penny."}
{"text":"Food is very good at decent prices.    My husband got the combination of steak and chicken (19.99).   The Caesar salad was odd as they gave us dressing on the side instead of tossing it like it is normally served.   

It is a loud restaurant....but our service was decent.    ."}
