{"text":"High end Cantonese restaurant. It is packed full during dinner, so reservation is highly recommended. It can be difficult to figure out what to order if you don't know cantonese food, but our waitress was very helpful in recommending their specialties. You can also look around to see what everyone else is getting since most that visit the place seem to be local Chinese. My gf enjoyed the TIger Prawns the best."}
{"text":"Came here just for the King Crab combo.
It is cooked 3 ways: 
1)Steamed with vermicelli noodles (mainly the thinner crab legs)
2)fried (choice of 1 sauce/seasoning: salt/pepper, Maggie sauce, or duck egg.  You can get this steamed too.  Mainly the thicker, meatier part of the crab legs and body.
3) crab meat with carbs (efu noodles or rice)

$40/lb!  She gave us an 8lb crab.   We would've been fine with a 6lb crab like they recommended, but she ended giving us a larger crab.  Not sure why.  Should have enquired.

Food was good, service was good but a bit confused why they didn't offer us a smaller crab.  Thus reason for a 3.5 star experience instead of 5."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time with work colleagues.  A table was reserved in the private room (that had a minimum spend amount).  When we arrived, we were seated in a small glass walled room that had 2 large tables for 10.  There was no door as well so I don't really consider this private.
The $468 set meal was ordered and I would have to say there were quite a few unique and tasty dishes.
1. Geoduck sashimi.  This was my first time trying and one could either eat raw or cook it by dipping slightly in broth.  Both ways were very good.
2. House Platter which consisted of sausages, pickled cucumbers, deep fried tofu with sesame (crispy on outside and soft on the inside), and black fungus.  Very unique platter.
3.  Deep fried oyster with salted egg yolk.  Light crispy coating with a meaty oyster inside.  A bit on the salty side  but not bad. 
4.  Shark fin soup.  Standard fare.
5.  Shredded chicken with sea cucumber.  The chicken meat was taken off the bones, shredded, mixed with sea cucumber and piled high on a plate and re-covered with thin pieces of the chicken skin.  This was delish and very easy to eat.
6.  Deep fried geoduck with spicy salt.  Very crispy with soft meaty interior.
7.  Stir fried lobster with vermicelli.  Also standard fare that can be ordered at any good Chinese seafood restaurant.
8. Snow pea leaves with braised mixed mushrooms.
9.  Steamed eel with dried tangerine peel and black bean sauce.  Good flavours but the eel was a bit chewy.
10.  Deep fried spare ribs.  Sweet with a good amount of meat per rib.
11.  Dessert was a walnut paste soup which was excellent.  Most Chinese restaurants would serve red bean soup.
Overall, a very good meal!
Will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Quality Chinese food located in a small plaza. Great food and great service. But it is better to make a reservation ahead of time tho, this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Great good but make sure to make a reservation! The egg yolk lobster is good but very very filling and heavy. Would only offer with large groups where you can share and eat some lighter things as well! The mustard beef is delicious."}
{"text":"4 and 1/2 stars.. Really delicious Chinese food. Ordered the meal on the Chinese-only menu that included:

Taiwanese appetizer plate, sausage, tofu and wood ear mushroomk

Lobster 2 ways, one coated with egg yolk, and the other with maggi sauce and vermicelli on top. The vermicelli had those fried coated crispy fish that soaked up the sauce.. Mm mmm

Steamed whole Sea Bass.. classic..

Stir Fried lotus root, sweet peas and other veg

Sweet Sour Pork

We added the soup which was very healthy/nutritious and bowls of rice. Left very satisfied and with couple of boxes of leftovers, so definitely worth the $ compared to other Chinese seafood places. 

Only con is space can be very small when tables are expanded to accommodate big parties... So I would say best to make reservations and keep to party of 6-8 people."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. Service was excellent. Very clean and nice inside. Fairly pricy place to chow."}
{"text":"The food taste actually deserves 3 stars, but it is the service and the cleanliness that really warrants concern.

This was a meal for 6 for $375, I expected better.  My gf and I both had severe diarrhea after lunch today and I think it may be related to the oysters that we had here.  The first time that the battered (and fried) oysters came, they had large lobster shells from what looks to be leftover from another meal in the batter.  There was a slight smell of things gone bad on the second batch but I ignored it and ate it thinking nothing of it only to pay the price a few hours later.

They rushed our bill and did not bring us change for our payment.  We also had called in advanced and booked a table which they did not reserve for us, so even with reservation, we had to wait in line. 

Overall, the food wasn't too bad tasting, and the first 2 times I came, we didn't have stomach aches.  I still wouldn't recommend this place to any friends.  

beware..."}
{"text":"OH NO! I was super excited to like this place.

My dad had come here with friends and saw George - for those of you who frequent Spring Villa, he used to be one of the \"heads\" there. Him and Michelle had left Spring Villa, and my dad saw him here at Ming's. We had to try this place!

This restaurant is small and super busy. There is a private-ish area right by the entrance which fits two tables. Thank goodness the other table was relatively quiet as sound bounces off.

We ordered this Duck dish which was smothered in a sauce that tasted like Chalet sauce...no joke. It was really good, but after a while, I was really thirsty. We also ordered this fried fish dish with tofu which was also very good, but salty. Soup was just enough for 11 people and quite small.

Now, reservations are HIGHLY recommended because this restaurant gets insanely busy and I understand why. For all the dishes we ordered, the total bill came out to be $188 and change. At Spring Villa, I suspect it would have been double if not triple the amount. Having said that, the food was not that great, and salty.

Service was also in the \"growing pains\" phase. As this is a new restaurant, service was spotty. Our dishes went un-cleared. Our pot of tea and water went unfilled. We had to hunt down for service every time we needed something. Because we were in the private-ish room, it made it even harder to get service. 

I don't think we will be back here as Spring Villa is closer and the food, we find, better. Having said that, perhaps there will be improvements."}
{"text":"My new favourite Chinese restaurant.

They executed every dish well. Paying a bit if a premium but I like them over their peers"}
{"text":"Small little Chinese restaurant serves excellent HK cuisine! 

Recommend to go at least 4 or more people. Quantity of each dish is enough for one person. 

Any how, couple dishes need to order before hand (at the time of reservation one day ahead)! 
For example sticky rice chicken - crispy outside and taste sticky fried rice in side. Great!!!

Also, a must have is their daily soup! Surprised this need reservation as well.

One famous dish is their sweet and sour pork. Usually made with pineapple to give the sour taste. Here they used fresh guava! Surprisingly it taste wonderful. Great pairing with deep fried pork."}
{"text":"Ming Ming, every time I come around yo city Ming Ming.  You would think this is your typical Chinese restaurant located in Richmond Hill, but you are wrong my friend.  No matter what time of day or day of the week, this place is rammed to the brim.  Yes people that want to get their egg coated lobster on, or people simply coming to gaze at their Chinese porcelain decor head to Mings.

I came here with the GF and fam, and they loved it.  The food here is not only fresh, it's delicious.  Probably the first place I have ever tried egg battered oysters or fried yellow-fin Garoupa cooked to perfection.  In fact the Garoupa here is the best I've had in Tdot, and I stand by that!

Service here is typical for this part of town, but the food comes out mega quick and their dishes and utensils are spick and span.  Order with caution though, the dishes are ginormous and super rich.  Expect to loosen up your belt a bit after a session at this joint!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Good quality food for reasonable price. Regular family gathering restaurant. Their lobster and vermicelli is delicious."}
{"text":"Love the deep fried tofu with black sesame. Crispy on the outside and oh so soft on the inside.

Besides that, I found the food to be generally too salty. As part of our set meal, we had the choice of lobster either deep fried with egg yolk and pumpkin, or fried with scallion. We chose the deep fried with pumpkin, and I didn't like the batter at all. It tasted very corn starch-y and salty. All the other dishes were pretty average."}
{"text":"Visited this location with some friends the other day. Nothing really to say about this location......it is clean, small restaurant. Traditional Cantonese food was served, Overall, it was a nice experience. 

On thing that you have to be careful of is the parking. The parking here is terrible. There were crazy drivers everywhere, and I almost got hit by one person while I was trying to park. Off to the side, I saw two people arguing over a parking spot. Maybe it was the lunch hour rush, or maybe it was a sunday afternoon and everyone was hungry....Whatever it was....i will not be going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, well-mannered servers & good dinner service overall! I loved the egg yolk battered lobster with pumpkin, as well as the honey coated oysters. I have not been here for lunch, but would highly recommend it for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekend lunch. The food was alright, but not to the point where it justified the more expensive prices here.
 
1) Hoinan Style Chicken with fat rice or steamed rice ($10.99) - they ran out of fat rice so I had to get steamed rice which was obviously more bland.  The winter melon soup that came with it was not bad though.
 
2) Silver Needle Noodle with Shrimp ($10.99) - the noodles were too soft / lacked elasticity.  But the flavour was well done.
 
3) Combo D ($23.80) which included generous portions of:
 
a) Free Range Chicken congee with sea cucumber - very little sea cucumber, more like just chicken congee.
b) XO sauce rice noodles - 1 of our 2 most impressed items we chose
c) Seasonal vegetable with soya sauce - decent, one couldn't really screw up this item
d) Deep fried vegetable with egg yoke sauce - 1 of our 2 most impressed items we chose
 
I found Combo D portion should be good for 2 people."}
{"text":"It's a good idea to make a reservation for this place as it gets busy (thanks to the other reviewers for this tip) . We had the fried egg yolk with prawn and pumpkin,  a vermicelli dish, soup and, garoupa belly with tofu, and the app-fried tofu. Everything was a notch up from other chinese restaurants. Our food arrived quickly and was mouth watering. It is definitely worth going back to try a few other dishes. The portions are large and we had 4 people (3 adults, 1 child) and lots of food leftover. They are really busy so don't expect them to be super friendly. I left satisfied and am currently so stuffed!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a lunch or dinner affair, price and portion are quite reasonable and food tastes great I liked the spareribs and shredded chicken as well the vermicelli in maggi sauce stir fired don't forget to make reservations though it's a small place"}
{"text":"Service has always been decent. This place is pretty much constantly busy and if you want to come at any lunch/dinner time, expect making reservations a have-to-do.

The food quality is quite good, but they are pricier than a regular chinese restaurant. Do not judge them on that scale as they are more upscale and the dishes that are on par with other upscale chinese restaurants, the prices are quite fair and the portion sizes are decent.

I dont like the wasabi chicken though.

Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Price point: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I've always wondered why there would be mad lineups outside. Now I know why.

Their food is a bit on the upscale side, so come in for a fancy feast (see my pictures)

Lobster was fresh and delicious. Their fish is AMAZING (crispy outside and tender inside)

Their sweet and sour pork was okay, I've had better. At least it was pretty lean on the fat.

Staff members are very friendly and attentive (big plus for Chinese restaurants in general as many often neglect this)

There's plenty of free parking in the private parking lot, and a pretty good Chinese bun place in the plaza you can check out while you're there.

I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who likes Chinese food that's a bit on the fancier side."}
{"text":"Points up for the decor! Yummy food :)

We ordered the set meal that came with:
- Marinated sausages & bean curd with veggies
- \"Hand-shredded\" chicken (I liked this one a lot!)
- Sweet & sour pork (The fruit was guava.. pretty special - it was yummy!)
- Salted egg yolk battered lobster (My favourite! There was salted egg yolk battered pumpkin too)
- Lobster with vermicelli
- Bok choy with mixed meats

Dessert: ALMOND SWEET SOUP
I don't usually like almond sweet soup but this place made it so good :D 

We will definitely return and will try their specialty soups (\"done tong\"). We didn't know about pre-ordering this until we arrived. Make sure you mention it in the reservations if you plan on trying this!"}
{"text":"Not too sure if this place is overrated or not but I heard about it through word of mouth and my aunt decided to have a family dinner here to celebrate my little cousin's birthday.

Since both families (mine and my aunt's) didn't know what to expect, we failed to realize how cramped the dining area is and how little (or non-existent) the waiting area is.  So we were eating dinner close to their door and had to put up with random people standing and watching us eat.

Overall, I would say the food was pretty decent but expensive (I could get similar food for a bit cheaper in Markham).  I'm not sure whether my family will come back but it's worth going to once to try."}
{"text":"Nice decor and cozy!  This restaurant is decorated as what its Chinese name implies: \"blue and white porcelain place\".   The lunch combo special comes with double boiled soup, one spring roll and an entree (rice/noodle).  The soup is boiled with lot of ingredients and it is intensely flavored.  The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves comes in big portion.  Before the bamboo steamer arrives, I have already smelled the lotus leaves.  It smells both refreshing and delicious.  The lunch combo is at great price; $8.99!!  Their congee special ranging from $17.80 to $38.80.  The lunch snacks are of reasonable price as well.  Fast and attentive service."}
{"text":"Taking two stars off this restaurant due to service. I always call ahead to reserve soup, lunch and dinner.  I made reservation and reserved soup for out of town guest and when we arrived, they said they accidentally spilled the pot of soup I ordered in the kitchen and it's no longer available.  It's obviously a lie because the server lowered her voice and said it really quickly.  Also it has a semi viewing area to the kitchen from the bar and we didn't notice anything wrong. I stopped coming to this restaurant after the incident.  I was raving the double boiled soup of this place to my guest and we had dinner there with huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with co-workers.  I didn't read all the Yelp reviews ahead of time, so I didn't order a lotus rice or an eggplant lunch combo.  I ordered a vegetarian stir fried vermicelli.  It tasted all right.  Nothing stood out: not the flavour, ingredients or cooking.  I had the special soup.  It had a nice, clean flavour.  Services was friendly, which was always something to cherish in a Chinese restaurant.

I will order a lotus rice next time to make up for this experience."}
{"text":"My first time here for dinner and I must say the food was great and the service was excellent!  The staff was very nice and courteous.  I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is easily one of the better high end Chinese places in the \"Hill\" for food. I'd prefer coming to this place over some of the other more well known High end Chinese places in the general vicinity.

There are downsides, in the sense, I am not the only one with this opinion, as it causes this place to be super busy for most days of the week, lunch & dinner. 

Food is pretty solid and I don't think I have had a bad dish there, since my family and I started visiting this place back in November 2014.

I find that their lunch specials are worth getting; along with the portions being fairly generous, it comes with a double boiled soup of the day; which already brings you good value, since there is a lot more work that goes into a double boiled soup versus the usual Chinese-style soup of the day.

Dinner wise - I love the gun sai pumpkin and their sea cucumber shredded chicken with wasabi - my family will always order these dishes. The gum sai is literally a batter of salted egg yoke coating pumpkin - sooooo good - it's just so salty, sweet and crispy and soft. 

So the downside is that we're not the only family, who thinks this place is the best High end Chinese restaurant in the \"Hill:\" Reservations are a MUST, even on a week night; I can not tell you how many times we've come here for dinner on a Tuesday night and found this place packed to the rafters. If you want to dine here- best make a reservation - they only do two seatings a night (1 at 6pm the other around 8pm) so dining time you are technically limited to 2 hours.

The space is quite cramped; as the tables are jammed together, so you may not find the dining experience to be most comfortable. If you are looking for a large private party dining - they only have 1 large private dining room of two 10/12 people tables off to the site. 

The service is friendly, but it can get extremely disorganized, especially if you are in the private dining area; because you're off to the side and away from the main kitchen area - so you're not as likely to get the attention of the limited staff working the floor."}
{"text":"If I could, I would rate Ming Cuisine as 3 1/2 stars.

We were tired after a long day, and just wanted something to go for dinner to take back to the hotel. We decided to try Ming Cuisine, and they were able to do takeout for us. We ended up ordering four dishes:

Rice soup with pork and oysters: good alternative to just plain white rice, and you get a pretty large serving

Hainan chicken: tender, with ginger sauce

Tiger prawns with maggi sauce: prawns were large and nicely cooked (good sauce)

Grouper with veggies and pine nuts: the fish was a little bland, and not a huge fan of the pine nuts

Overall, the food was pretty good, even for take out. I would like to try their dishes eating in next time."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

I won't kid, this place is pricey. However I felt the food was worth it.

My parents took me to Ming Cuisine for dinner when I was visiting them in Toronto, as they raved the excellent Chinese food and seafood here. The dinner menu was quite extensive, however we went off the board for most of our orders.

One off the board item we ordered was the geoduck sashimi. Definitely a recommendation if they have them in stock (limited supply as I was told). We also had the crab meat and fish maw thick soup, general tao chicken, crispy bitter melon (off the board item), and a manta ray fillet (off the board item). I could probably do without the bitter melon, but everything else tasted very good. Reminded me of Dragon Boat in a few ways.

The decor is quite upscale, which reflected the pricing here. Unfortunately the seating layout wasn't the best, as there's areas near the back where the seats and tables were quite cramped.

Service was excellent, as is expected with an upscale place like this. I'll definitely return and try more items (perhaps even their lunch menu)."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese restaurant so far. The sweet and sour pork was soooo good! over all service was friendly. Would go back again for their sweet and sour pork again!!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but they play favourites. If they have familiar guests, they will always seat them first. We had reserved a table, and had our entire party there, but they ended up seating someone they knew at the open table -- alone and waiting for the rest of their party. We ended up having to wait quite a while for another table to open up."}
{"text":"Ming Cuisine is a seafood Chinese restaurant - the space isn't too big, so you would have to make a reservation in advance, especially on the weekend. We ordered the $148 5pound lobster combo for dinner:

The starter side dishes are Taiwanese sausages with garlic and a vegetarian medley of Chinese vegetables and tofu in a vinaigrette sauce. It is pretty unique and different from other starter dishes that I have had in the past.

The next dish was the first lobster dish - it was lobster with vermicelli. The dish had great flavour, and the vermicelli was cooked perfectly. 

The second lobster dish was lobster meat and pumpkin cooked in fried egg yolk. That's right, fried egg yolk. It tastes like a very rich and umami flavoured tempura. It was very filling even after eating two or three pieces.

The other dishes in the meal included half a chicken as well as beef tenderloin prepared in Chinese style. I found these dishes were mediocre - it was kind of bland, and the beef was a bit chewy. Lastly, there was an almond paste desert which was prepared very well.

The customer service was superb - all the staff were friendly and courteous. They changed our plates a few times and were very prompt with answering our questions on the menu. Overall, I really liked the meal and would definitely go again for their seafood."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here, and the menu featured some unique tasty dishes. Some standouts were Lobster with e-noodles, and the cold shredded spicy chicken. Restaurant is in a small strip mall, and was lively and busy on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"5/6 of us got food poisoning after a seafood combo lunch from this restaurant. The egg yolk battered oysters had lobster shells in them. 
The male server was extremely rude--asked us to pay the bill when the last dish wasn't even served. I actually wanted to call the manager and complain about him, but didn't want to ruin his livelihood if he has a family to take care of. But a restaurant that tolerates his kind of behaviours and serves food that's gone bad will not survive long.

This wasn't my first time here but will be my last time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but yet to be disappointed. Since they are small and full even on a weeknight, reservation is highly recommended.
Consider the area, their dishes are a little more on the expensive side BUT for very good reason. They are not big on using crazily expensive ingredients, but higher quality ones. They are not stingy with these higher quality ingredients nor quantity of food. That's how they keep their quality high and people keep coming back."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food, and I really enjoyed their shredded chicken with wasabi sauce. However, the service was absolutely disorganized, the dishes took too long to serve, and then they had the guts to tell us the next group was here for our table! They did not have a specific server dedicated to each table, but that meant we had EVERY server (I counted 7 different servers) stop by our table to take our order, then ask if we needed rice when we had dishes served, etc. On one hand, that level of attention is unparalleled, however it certainly disrupted our family dinner conversations with so many interruptions to answer the same tedious questions. At times, we were worried they would double-take our orders! Perhaps try coming on a weekday when there are less servers, and less people, and less opportunity for confusion."}
{"text":"This might seem to be an ordinary Chinese restaurant. Dishes are no different compare to others but if you taste the dish, you can tell a big difference. Flavours is just right, steam fish showed great knife skills and perfect steaming time. Seafood is always fresh. Chicken tasted very good with a well balance taste of Chinese spice and wasabi. Not too overwhelming. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Good solid Chinese food!  The restaurant is quite small and it seems to be always full.  We couldn't get a table the times when we came without a reservation so unless we have one we don't bother trying to just walkin.

The seafood here is great especially if you like fresh steam fish.  We also really like some of their specialty dishes like the Shredded Chicken with Sea cucumber with wasabi and Steam Tofu with Scallops in garlic & black bean sauce.  We usually change the tofu to be in garlic sauce only without the half of the dish in the black bean sauce.

Be sure to leave some room for the complementary dessert.  Although prices are a little high, the food is really good.  Don't forget to make reservations."}
{"text":"My review is based on my lunch experience. 

Food: 4 stars - the lunch combo: choose from 10 main dish items and each comes with a bowl of double boiled soup and veggie spring roll. We ordered Hoi Nam style Chicken with Rice and Spare ribs  Steam Rice in Bamboo pot. The quality of food is good. Chicken has a nice texture and flavour. Spare ribs are tender and well marinated. 

Service: This is the problem and I feel hesitate to go back. Ming Cuisine seems to be a \"higher end\" Cantonese cuisine restaurant, but the lunch service is very lacking. We arrived shortly after noon, the restaurant is almost filled. Because of overly crowded, we needed to share a big table with another group (that is common in low end Chinese restaurants/ HK style cafes). After we are seated, We waited for 10 minutes and being ignored; even we waved to the servers numerous times and they avoided eye contact with me. Tea was not refilled during the whole meal. 

My Yelp friend, Jennifer K advised me to go there early otherwise the double boiled soup will be sold out and replaced with other type of soup. This time we are fortunate to get the double boiled soup, however the Hoi Nam Chicken ran out of chicken fat rice but we have to take the white rice after we placed the order."}
{"text":"Food was alright, but they over charged me on the seafood, I saw the scale said 3lbs but the lady told me 3.5lb?!?! If you pay cash you get 10% off. Why? Dishonest business."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite authentic Chinese restaurants. Some of the dishes here are quite unique. For lunch, we usually order the seafood soup rice noodles, where the soup base is made fresh daily and is full of flavour. The sweet and sour pork is extra tasty and is always a dinner favorite. The prices are on the higher side, so it won't be your daily dining room, but it is always a family favorite."}
{"text":"Truth without exaggeration, the wait is not avoidable. I waited for about 45 minutes. I walked in at the same time as another group of three. After 10 minutes they were seated. I then spent the next 35 minutes watching several tables of 4-8 being seated all of which had reservations. RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST. Then a couple walks in claiming they have a reservation. They clearly do not because their name was not on the reservation list I've been staring at for the last half hour. They were about to get seated when I complained. And then we finally got seated. It was a rush. After being seated I waited for 5 minutes and I watched he other table who was seated after us get their tea... So my husband complained and they finally came to get me tea. They also finally took our order. Turn around here is slow, they are understaffed. If they had more employees they would probably get us in and out faster and make more money with quicker turn arounds... Seriously I should give them ZERO stars for service.

Does the food make up for it?! Yes, it does. The originally 2 star service restaurant gets extra stars in the taste and quality of food. I would give this restaurant a 3.5 because all though my lobster noodles were fantastic, their menu is on the small or less choices side especially for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"If you go to a new restaurant on a Wednesday night, at 9pm, and it is packed to the brim, you KNOW there's a lil' sumthin sumthin going on.

Came here with the family and ordered 3 dishes. The price of the dishes are around $15-20 each, but we ordered the fried yellow-fin Garoupa, which is a pricier dish at $30. The meal comes with a big vat of soup, with the meats and veggies that the soup is made with being served alongside. Very delicious, and practically counts as a dish in itself. We ordered the steamed chicken, a classic dish. The chicken is smooth and meaty, not too salty. Also ordered the beef with bitter melon. Everyone on the table agreed that the beef was absurdly good - tender, flavourful, juicy. I think with these two dishes went ridiculously well with white rice.

The Pièce De Résistance was the fried Garoupa. The fish itself is white and meaty, and really takes on flavours well. We got a tail piece, and the main bone was already removed for us. This came with veggies on the side, and most remarkably, the skin was still crunchy and crispy, despite being slathered with sauce. Very very very good.

The prices here are actually very reasonable because the dishes are very large, so it's perfect for sharing. The meal ended with complimentary dessert, which changes from evening to evening. We had the cashew paste, which was fantastic! Smooth and authentic!!! 

Overall, I'd say this is a 4.5 star experience (but Yelp offers no half stars...)"}
{"text":"Came here for the lobster set dinner last night. Food was great and tasty, BUT 5 out of 6 of us got really sick after about 6 to 8 hours. This includes a high schooler and sadly an 82 year old senior. Everybody showed symptoms of food poisoning. The 5 of us were suffering vomiting, diarrhea, slight temperature and body ache all day long. We ended up taking the 82 year old to Scarborough Grace ER via ambulance. Not a good way to spend New Year Eve. :("}
{"text":"Ming Cuisine is a higher end Chinese that opened up recently in Richmond Hill.

The restaurant though smallish but nicely decorated. Love the blue and white theme instead of all those glittering gold. 

Lunch Special $8.99 includes soup, spring roll and a noodle/rice dish. There are snacks and sides for around $5 which is great to share.

Since I arrived for a late lunch, their usual double boiled soup ?? was gone but replaced by fish maw soup which was good and supposed to be healthy too.

For main I ordered  Rice in Lotus Leaf ?????. It does take awhile to arrive as they all made to order. The portion is huge!  Great to share.

Definitely worth coming for lunch. The special order menu can be quite interesting. Just make sure you call for reservations!"}

{"text":"We came on a cold sunny Saturday and were late enough to miss the lunch crowd but early enough to still be able to take advantage of the lunch specials. 

Location:
This place is located on 16th and Spadina Road. Its in a plaza with some other restaurants. There's a bus stop on the corner if you want to bus it but dude, it's the suburbs. Tonnes of free parking.

Decor:
Its small and very elegant. I love the decor. Its dark wood, and blues, with a pretty golden painting on the back wall. The first visit was when it had first opened and they were working out some kinks I guess. Seating consisted of tables and chairs, no booths. There's a biggish private room to the side that looks like it can fit maybe 15- 20 people.

Food:
They have a three 'course' Prix fixe lunch specials for $9.99. We decided to each get one and share.

It comes with soup, a spring roll, and the main that you ordered. We got corn and chicken soup. (The house soup was out. We were bummed, it's delicious), a tiny spring roll, and an order of egplant in minced pork with xo sauce and a steamed rice with Chinese sausage in a lotus leaf.

Soup was delicious I love the corn soup. It always looks like they opened a can of creamed corn in a pot of chicken soup. I really like creamed corn. . The spring roll came on a skewer and was nice a fresh and crunchy. I lived the steamed rice. I tend to find the Chinese sausage a strong flavour because it's usually in big chunks but it was almost minced and I liked the flavour distribution. My favourite dish is the eggplant and chilli and this was not a disappointment. The eggplant was soft but not overcooked and stringy. The xo sauce was really flavourful and enhanced the pork nicely. Nice spice level too.

Service:
Service was efficient. I wouldn't exactly call anyone who waited our table as friendly or concerned for our enjoyment, but we got the food and they refilled out tea fast and efficiently so who needs to make friends.

Love this place.

Now I only need to get a vip card for it because I picture myself coming back over and over!!"}
