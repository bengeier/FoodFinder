{"text":"Harry's is awesome. The brunch is perfect, the staff is friendly, the location is wonderful. What more could you ask? We go there every weekend."}
{"text":"Amazing. I had the salmon, my friend had the ny strip. Both were flawless. The fries were also incredibly perfect, and the server was super nice and attentive. Absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"This place is great. With a full bar, bar seating area, and dining area there is an atmosphere for anyone. I didn't have an entree but the Parmesan crab dip and fried Brie were very tasty.
Def would come back for dinner or lunch again. 
As a side note all of the servers seem to be enjoying themselves which makes for a more light and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Parmesan crab with pita is awesome, didn't have dinner but lots of local beers on tap.  +++"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. Label burger best in Charlotte. You have to get the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Instead of a tasty, well cooked, burger (I ordered medium-rare), I got an overcooked, dry, tasteless burger.  I went to Harry's on a night that was not overly crowded.  I ordered their burger (one of their 'favorites' items.  It was supposed to be a good burger with better cuts of meat than you would find in a cheaper burger.

For a restaurant of this price ($20 for just a burger/tax/tip?) I would expect something quite a bit tastier."}
{"text":"The burger is outstanding, as are the flatbreads and the kids menu. It seems as though anything you would ask (special prep for kids, side item, etc.) was always met with \"absolutely.\" Noise level was fine, service was fast and polite (Casey is fantastic, cute & friendly) and the crowd is a good mix of business, friends & families. I pass through CLT for business 6 - 8x per year & I will definitely be back. For those that complain about expense, I don't understand - it seems to fall right in the middle of places with food of this quality."}
{"text":"Don't use your open table app for this place because you won't get your points.  They didnt understand the system to show that I had checked in.  Neat.

Scallops were small and tasted fishy.  

Bartender was great.  Drinks were cold and plentiful.  Hostess was a dumb-dumb."}
{"text":"First time here yesterday. I went here for a business lunch. It's a nice spot for a nicer lunch. The service was very good. The food was good - though they were out of salmon. Evidently they are famous for their sweet potato fries. On one hand I get that. They were perfectly cooked and generously served.  I ate every single one, but they put vanilla flavoring in/on them! Sweet potatoes are already sweet, why on earth would you add vanilla?  It was very disconcerting. I'd give this place 4.5 stars at this point. I could up that if future visits are good - and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Food good, prices ridiculous !  Burger w/ sweet potato fries and 1 hi-ball drink were $32 before tip!!!  No burger is that good."}
{"text":"What a gem!  We came into town for 2 nights and luckily we found Harry's on  our first night.  We loved it so much we went back second night.  

The first night we had an assortment of appetisers...duck wings, fried brie, and sliders. The duck was so amazing we had to order more. The portion size on the appetizers were pleasantly large.

The second night we had the burger which is a blend of different meats and the surf and turf, a crab cake and a 6 oz rib eye. The crab cake was the best I have ever had and I am a crab cake connoisseur.

The have a great bar as well, and a great selection of beer and wine. 

This is definitely not a place you want to miss!"}
{"text":"I had the bacon wrapped rib eye there one night.  It was very good for the price.  Sweat potato fries were good.  Very good Caesar salad and a good atmosphere.  I went back for lunch the next day and the club was very good."}
{"text":"Flew in to Charlotte and caught dinner here last Friday. Never heard of a bison meatloaf so I figured I would try it and was completely blown away. Another guy I was with ordered the strip steak and took a bite. Not sure if it was the seasoning or the way the chef had it seared it but I haven't had a cut of meat that flavorful in a long while. Good cocktail selection as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Delicious Brussel sprouts, beer cheddar soup and salmon. Service was excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that the $15 burger, fish tacos, Caesar salad and spinach salad with salmon as well as duck Wings were excellent! Delicious and well portioned and presented.

Now...the service.  Amy was terrible. She did barely did the minimum of anything that resembled good customer service. She sat down our drinks without a word. I asked her to  change our TV channel from soccer to baseball and she couldn't be bothered. I asked Amy about a drink I had there before but didn't see on the menu. She answered but condescendingly. She was completely disengaged and should work stocking in the back -- something that doesn't involve people contact.  

Andrew was great however! Asking how we were doing, how our food was, if we needed anything....which is the minimum for any  server! Compared to Amy he was exemplary and I told him we didn't want Amy anymore, just him.  

And to make sure Amy didn't get any share of the 20% tip!

Management should do some training with Amy or just give her a job away from customers."}
{"text":"My second visit, this time with four people. We were trying to avoid a hugely expensive meal so two went with burgers, one did the meatloaf and the other had a mix of things. Overall, it was good but not memorable. 

The meatloaf was a bit dry and the burgers were missing the snap of flavor we were expecting from menu description. Made with three kinds of beef, top led with bacon and cheese, we were hoping it would explode with flavor. It did not. The pretzel role was a trendy twist. It was dense but again not very flavorful. 

We shared two appetizers, a crab dip which was really average tasting and a rib roast flat bread which was the best thing served that night. 

Great local beer selection and terrific service."}
{"text":"Date night and my wife and I were looking for something different.  Searching through yelp I came across this spot, read some reviews and made a reservation.  Harry's is a great place.  We were pleased with the customer service and simplicity of the menu both food and drink. My wife had the pork chop with carmalized onions and apples.  She absolutely loved it along with the polenta cakes and sauteed vegetables.  I had the 12oz NY Strip and it was cooked perfect for me.  My sides were roasted brussel sprouts and the veggie risotto.  I am a big fan of risotto especially now that Hell's Kitchen is back on tv.  Overall, our meal was very good taste and presentation.  The decor of Harry's was also good.  I look forward to getting back there as soon as I can.  Oh yeah try the Deluxe Tuxedo Cake and Blackberry Cheesecake with the raspberry drizzle on the bottom.  AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We always bring our family here when they come in from out of town. The Black Label Burger is by far the best burger we have had! The mix of different meats makes it perfect. The sweet potato fries are delicious and are cooked in a wonderful vanilla batter. The atmosphere is great, the staff was always there and very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.

My family and I eat lunch here about once every other week. 

Their Black Label Burger(blend of porterhouse, brisket, and short rib, topped with Pravin smoked bacon, sharp cheddar, and served on a toasted bun) is the best hamburger I have ever eaten and I will continue to get this menu item almost every time I eat there.

Great beer selection.

The staff is very friendly and helpful.

The place is probably one of the cleanest I have seen.  Dining area, bar, and restrooms are always spotless."}
{"text":"Duck wings are a must and the pork chops & crab cakes were great and our server James made it even better"}
{"text":"Harry's food is always good- especially love their lobster mac and cheese, and their Parmesan crab dip..however, they have lots of staffing issues (especially during lunch). I've had waits of up to 30-45 mins because they were short-staffed...and then there would be open tables as the line grew behind me, which is frustrating when you are on a limited time frame and starving. 

Not sure if they are having trouble hiring reliable servers/kitchen staff, but they've lost my lunch business multiple times to other restaurants in Arysley because I'm not waiting a half hour to eat on my lunch hour.  More than once, I've had very slow service there. Hopefully they are improving front and back of house management to turn this around, because its a great spot."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and it was AWESOME. Excellent food and service. We loved the pimento cheese with smoked gouda. I had the eggs florentine and it was delicious, loved the cream sauce though it was a little too runny for me but the mushrooms were yummy. Our fantastic server recommended the potato cakes and they were perfect! My husband got the black label burger and loved the combination of beef cuts. We would DEFINITELY recommend this place and come back for more!"}
{"text":"Okay, seriously, this place...  Caught up with my husband and daughter there, nearly done eating.  Ordered a crab cake, and commenced to pick at their leftovers while I waited.  Amazing-delicious.  Both husband and daughter had the fillet mignon salad -- melt in your mouth fillet  The prices were really, really reasonable -- fillet salad was $13.  Unfortunately missed most of a slider trio they'd already devoured.  I got a bit of an andouille slider but didn't care for it -- but I'm not a huge fan of andoullie  But then my daughter gave me half her fillet slider, which was too  rare for her.  Score!.  When the crab cake arrived it was so freaking good -- filled with lump crab, topped with some kind of maybe asian slaw, on a -- for lack of a better word -- \"smear\" of wasabi dressing.  I'm picky about my crab cakes -- this probably was the best I've had.  If not, it's one of my top two.  (Other is at The Pharmacy in Southport NC)  If you are in the Charlotte area, run, don't  walk.  It's actually in a new, very large town center kind of condo-retail-entertainment development called Ayrsley, which, at this writing, was mostly vacant, giving it the feel of a studio lot... or a town where something's gone very, very wrong..."}
{"text":"My wife and I like riding motorcycles and we jumped on our bikes to ride over and have a nice lunch experience for lunch.  We entered the bar for the left.  It was a really nice bar.  My wife and I eat at the bar but there was not a bar tender in sight.  Well, we thought that someone would greet us to say someone would be with you in a minute but nothing. We sat there for about 5 minutes so we assumed we were invisible so we got up drove our Harleys out from the so called restaurant.  They might think that HD riders are low class red neck bikers but I will tell you that my wife and I have a lot of friends and the word of mouth travels very fast.  I would never ever go to that what ever it is ever again. I will do my be to discourage any from going to that whatever.  Don't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up w/friends or sit at the bar and have Jessica mix a cocktail for you. Food is good and drinks are plentiful."}
{"text":"Great service, great selection, great atmosphere.  If you have ANY questions about the wine list or the beer list, ask to speak with Bryan, the GM.  He was amazingly helpful and knowledgeable.  I had the mac n cheese and a flatbread - both were good."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant that was near the Embassy Suites that two friends and I went for lunch. First off, we had really good warm bread with a honey herb butter. I had the spinach salad with grilled salmon. The salad was fresh, the salmon was grilled perfectly with a nice crispy exterior, but moist on the inside and the wine vinegarette was delicious. My friend had the Grown up Grilled Cheese, which she said was really good. The fries had a good crisp on them that didn't whimp out under the ketchup. Other friend also had the Spinach Salad, which she said was fresh and crisp. Waiter service was attentive and good, he answered all of our questions and kept our glasses filled. I don't remember the waiter's name though. I would definitely eat here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon, risotto, & green beans... It was really good food that filled me up & left me feeling satisfied with me decision to eat healthy. I would go here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had the great black label burger. Hubby had the pork chop. Both dishes were delicious. For an appetizer we shared the duck wings and the jicama slaw. Very tasty. Adrianna our waitress was patience with two out of towners.  Will be stopping this way again on our way thru Charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had dinner here for our wedding anniversary. The Manager was so friendly - he came to our table and wished us a Happy Anniversary. He even brought us champagne! 

I have a gluten allergy and ordered the broiled salmon with lemon & thyme, caramelized Brussels sprouts, and parmesan risotto, with a small mixed greens salad. It was excellent! 

I was very pleased that the manager took the time to talk to me about how the restaurant prepares 99% of everything in-house and that they are very cautious with food allergies. I learned that some items, although not listed as gluten free on the menu, can be modified to make them safe. 

We would have returned to Harry's for the food & atmosphere, even before meeting the manager, but now it feels like a neighborhood place. 

I would have given 5 stars if someone had told me prior to ordering that I wasn't limited to the 3 entrees on the menu that were marked as Gluten Free. It would have given me more options.

We look forward to our next dinner @ Harry's!"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of food and drinks.  They don't waste their time putting things on the menu that are ok.  This menu is a good size and allows them to focus on making each dish great.  We really like the soups, sliders...and everything else.  Good atmosphere and a really friendly staff 

Great beer selection celebrating many of the local beers from the region which is a testament to their commitment to local motion...buy local, support local.  Truly a gem."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon.
Was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.  Shrimp and grits on points and chicken sandwich was perfect.  Our server  Brooks was awesome!!  Thanks Brooks and best wishes on your wedding day!!"}
{"text":"This is LITERALLY the best place to get a spicy shrimp pasta. First time here and I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Beer selection was nice and the food was memorable."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, dark, great variety of beer, simple menu, good food but not impressive. 

Made reservations but when we arrived they had given our table to an older couple so my coworker and i had ti sit at the bar. The waiter was either tired or not in the mood to work.

In general not the place i would go back to."}
{"text":"Had a great meal while traveling through.  I had the Cajun pasta, it was wonderful as was the rack of lamb my husband had.  The service was very good as well.  A very good find ! The grandkids had good meals as well, they had a great menu for all."}
{"text":"Not impressed
Ordered the \"fresh catch\"
Happened to be swordfish, which I love.  Unfortunately their idea of grilled means, cook it till its dry and flavorless
I had the whipped potatoes (very good) and grilled asparagus (which never can near a grill, and were about the size of my show strings)
Overall, would not recommend or comeback.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Had the burger everyone said was good... Unless you like paying $15 for a so-so burger, don't waste your time. 5 guys has a better burger than that... Waste of $21 for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars if their shots of Jameson weren't $11. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch and I think everyone should visit to try the grown up pimento cheese sandwich.  Delicious.  Also had the cheese and beer soup.   Impressive beer list both bottle and tap."}
{"text":"Not sure why it's taken me so long to write this review but I've been here 8 or 9 times. This place is a hidden winner (I'm not big on giving out 5 stars) and here's why:

1st the food is amazing - I haven't eaten anything here I regretted ordering. I always leave full and happy. I struggle to decide what to have because the menu items are all so good.

2nd The wine list is solid.

3rd they have great local beers on tap - and it's a pretty big selection.

4th The price is reasonable - standard bar pricing for above standard everything.

5th The service - by the 2nd or 3rd visit the bartenders know you. They are friendly and attentive. It feels like you just belong here.

I read here that the table service isn't as good - I can't speak for that. I'd recommend the bar/lounge area but thats just me.

Thats it go try it.... if you see me, say hello."}
{"text":"We love coming here.  Fantastic staff,  great atmosphere and delicious beer that satisfy all palates. And no worries, they serve wine and liquor too. The staff is very knowledgeable and are able to suggest any desired request. 

We are not huge on staying up late on New Years Eve and being relatively new to the area,  really had no where to go.  In addition, I'm not a huge Valentine's Day fan, in fact, I think it's overrated. Yes, I am a female and I just said that and my husband loves me for it, LOL! Well, this place advertised three course dinners for a flat rate of $50. We came here on. New Year's  Eve and the day before Valentine's  Day and took advantage of their delicious menu. I am talking about choices from fried brie with mango chutney & vanilla apples to spinach & goat cheese puff pastries with balsamic & basil tomato for apps to pistachio crusted rack of lamb and two petite filets (blackened & rosemary crusted) for entrees to assorted chocolate truffles and warm caramel & cinnamon apple slices with angel food cake & french vanilla whipped cream for desserts . Mouth watering yet?!

I have to say this was a welcomed change and we loved every bite! Keep a watch out for another and take advantage as its definitely worth it.  Love that you have choices up to four for the entrees alone, which includes a fish dish, of course. 

And can I say anymore about the staff - Tiffany,  Drew, Brian, Amanda, and Jessica will totally take care of you."}
{"text":"We always arrive in Charlotte just in time for a late dinner.  As soon as we check in we head to Harry's.  Perfect bar food, but well above average.  I got the special beef hamburger with bacon (can't get menu to come up online atm so I don't have the exact name), but it was amazing.  You could tell the quality of the meat, and they are more than generous with nice crispy bacon (I hate it when it's soggy!)  The fries are amazing (some you try, and some you try to finish...these definitely fell into want to eat them all category!).  Everything we ordered was good and satisfied 2 kids and 2 adults.  Great bar spot for adults, and separate dining area friendly to kids.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Looking for something new and lively as I travel solo often. I asked the bartender what she recommended and she asked all the right questions. How hungry? In mood for? What you leaning toward? After I answered she suggested the Cajun Shrimp Pasta.  And you know what? It was spot on!!! Just enough and very flavorful. A+"}
{"text":"Since I am here just southwest of Charlotte on a job assignment, decided to try this place out with a coworker buddy of mine. The menu was definitely very impressive with lots of healthy choices of gluten free, grassfed and vegan foods. I had the bison meatloaf in which Bison is one of the healthiest and leanest meats to eat especially since it's grassfed. I had it along with the Brussel sprouts and sweet potato fries. The meatloaf was definitely up there with the best meatloafs I have ever eaten. The meat was succulent, very tender and just melts in you mouth and with the infused cheddar cheese and chipotle aioli just has you saying wow. The Brussel sprouts definitely flavorful and the sweet potato fries to die for. Simply an amazing dish and highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service.  It's true about the sweet potato fries, they are absolutely delicious.  A good mix on the menu, but a lot of it is pretty pricey.  Highly recommend the duck wings with bourbon bbq sauce."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time it wasn't very busy but the food was VERY good.  Definitely will be going here again."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Wow the food and service is amazing. 
Got Brooks nice guy and great server. 
The host down in the restaurant was great and helpful. 
I ordered the meatloaf boy was that a mistake now I don't want anything else. 
The Brussels were so good."}
{"text":"I like Harry's it will do in a pinch, I just never crave anything on the menu. The burger is probably the best item they offer. The brunch is also very good. It is just a bit expensive for what you get. It is one of the better places in a bad food area.

{"text":"I've been to this business several times, food and service was always good. Tonight was no exception. I ordered the lobster mac which had a really good taste. But as i was wrapping up i mentioned to the bartender that it didn't really seem to have the lobster there, only in one bite. I was sort of given a cold shoulder about this. Which was weird, i didn't ask for a manager or a comp. Just let him know what i thought which is why i gave them 2 stars. Always address a concern no matter how big or small. I also noticed the gentleman next to me consumed less than half of his large plate and declined to take a bag with him but didn't voice any concern so i did when i thought it was questionable. However the glass of wine and cocktail was Great. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place when I saw its location, and even higher once I saw its decor, needless to say, it blew them all out of the water. The food was phenomenal, the service was exceptional, the prices just right. From the most basic fries, to the steaks and meatloaf. It was all above anything I could have expected. Truly this is a hidden gem you have to try.

The service is well above par. The bartenders, the wait staff, all the way to the hostesses were fantastic at their jobs, excelled at customer service, and truly made you feel like they wanted to share in your wonderful dining experience. 

Without a doubt take an evening and dine here. You won't regret it. Bask in the ambience, have a (fantastically priced) bottle of wine, and definitely order a dessert or two."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday evening with a Living Social deal.  There were not many people in the restaurant so, it was nice and quiet with great service!

We got the bacon wrapped ribeye and chicken risotto.  Both were excellent and had wonderful flavor!  The mashed potatoes with the ribeye were awesome!  

We also got the chocolate cake cheesecake - can't remember the name of it, but it was fabulous!

I'm not sure if we will be back without another deal since it can get a little pricey and it is out of the way, but it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great food.

Stiff drinks

sweet dessert.

Try their steak from Omaha Steaks reserve."}
{"text":"This is just an average place thinking it is a lot better than it is.  We were with a group of 15 and while service was competent NO ONE said there meal was great.  In fact everyone said it was just OK and thought was pretty pricey for what they got.  No need to return for a long while"}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Saturday night after making reservations for 6 pm. We were seated quickly and offered drink and food menus. The wine  list was extensive with a good by the glass selection. The dirty martini was up to par. No appetizers were ordered. No bread was offered. I had the scallops and steak entree while my companions ordered steaks. I loved the side dishes- I had risotto (phenomenal!) with asparagus with I believe a béarnaise sauce while the others had Brussel sprouts and fries.  The asparagus and Brussels were delicious.  The scallops were tender, sweet and had a nice sear. My steak was medium rare and I thought a little tough but I'm not complaining. All in all, I appreciated the quiet atmosphere, the waiter was top notch and the food quality was very good. I will come back if I get the chance again."}
{"text":"Excellent burger....not cheap at 15$. Wife had the brunch omelette with steak...eggs were done perfectly but steak tasted burnt...overwhelmed all the other flavors. The fries were amazing...definitely recommend those as a side. Kids meals are tiny so recommend more as a date night than a family place but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Service awesome at lunch, the crab cake sandwich is full of crab meat and flavor,  bun over buttered, but crab cake did not need it.  Salads are fresh, side salad is a decent size.  Salmon on the regular salad was a large portion and cooked perfectly.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never been to Harry's before. It happened to snow today, but my girlfriend and I wanted to go out. They were opened and we heard good things about them. The food was excellent and it is well worth the try. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I have gotten the pretzel bacon burger every single time. It's just the best burger around. Seriously. The bun is always soft, the bacon is crisp and the meat is organic. I LOVE coming here and every single time the burger has been exceptionally. The staff here has been super cool and attentive and I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a fab burger. 

I can't talk about the other items because I every single time I eat here I get the burger. It's sublime."}
{"text":"Kevin was awesome,  martinis were great and the food was off the chain! Worth the price!"}
{"text":"So I have to give a shot out to James,the greatest server ever!!!! He is so much fun and makes this a great place to eat!!! Keep up the good work. So enough about James let's talk about the best sweet potato fries in Charlotte. #AMAZING!!!!!! Duck wings!!! AMAZING!!!! Lobster Mac and Cheese is pretty good. This is literally 3 miles from my house and my new favorite place!! #love"}
{"text":"Made a res and got a table with a very nice, thick and cumfy seat cushion. The staff is very friendly and everything on the menu looked great. Got the surf and turf (filet and crab cake) with risotto and polenta with some green veggie in it and it was all the bomb. Added a side salad and devoured that too. Had some extra to take home, great value. For a $$ this place is 5 stars. Beware the seats in the bar are wood."}
{"text":"Emily was wonderful! 
Sat in the bar area, whole restaurant was busy on a Monday night at 630p.
Drinks were fast,  ordering was quick. Food was brought out not long after. Great timing on everything! 
Salmon w/green beans & risotto yummy good, tasty and fresh. Not heavy on salt or seasonings. 
Pork chop w/mashed potatoes & vegetables very good!
Full & satisfied didn't want to order desert.
Will come back!"}
{"text":"We ate here after a long day at Carowinds with our 2 young boys. Judging by the name of the place, we expected a casual tavern, but when we walked in we felt a bit underdressed. We sat anyways and since they brought out some kid menus and crayons, all seemed fine. I'm glad we stayed!!

I loved the ambience and food. Would love to come back for a date night. I ate the sirloin flatbread with goat cheese and balsamic reduction and it was amazing! The flavor combo was so unique. The sweet potato French fries were also the best I've ever had. My spinach salad was also good. My drink Carolina on the Beach was excellent. Our boys split a kids pizza and my fries and had plenty to eat."}
{"text":"Honestly really was excited to try Harry's out. The brunch was quite bad. Over cooked omelet. Spinach Florentine with an entire cream sauce, couldn't eat it. Potato cakes extremely greasy. Really wanted it to be great but it really disappointed me and my wife.

Wish I could give it a zero stars. Maybe lunch and dinner is nice good food. But you are better off at Burger King than brunch here."}
{"text":"Best Burger I've had in Charlotte... Mueller's was the best... until their owner passed... Liberty gets all the kudo's but Harry's is great... plus other menu items as well."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything I didn't like from here. Food, drinks, apps, and service have always been great."}
{"text":"When we walked in there was no one at the hostess station, we waited a bit then I had to ask a waiter to seat us. Once we sat down we had a miserable waitress \"greet\" us. My Aunt and Mother ordered coffee, which did not come with sugar, they had to wait for her to walk back by and ask for it. We waited for lunch quite a while and we had to get up and ask for a coffee refill. Lunch was just ok, I had a bigger with an egg, both were well done, even though I asked for medium. Waitress got slightly more friendly but brought check while we were still eating and did not offer dessert."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in that side of town. Good selections and everything I've had was great. I really like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had Dinner there the other night. It was a very good meal and attentive service. I had the filet sandwich that was prepared perfect. 1.50 domestics on Monday made it a good deal. They also had a ton of beers on tap as well.  My gal had the tuxedo cheesecake, it was awesome. 

Bar was busy but not overcrowded. Good place for drinks or quiet dinner. Hope to see y'all there sometime.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"So we actually never ate here but judging by the non welcome at the front door I can only imagine what else was in store for us.We were in town as we evacuated Charleston due to Hurricane Matthew. we had my elderly father in law who happens to walk with a walker.
After trudging thru the rail to get to the place we entered and met a hostess and what appeared to be the manager.
Asked for a table for 4 and the reaction was we are totally booked. head down back to facebook or whatever they do when not wanting to make eye contact.

Gee I wonder if \"Oh sorry we are all booked up because our food is so good\" Or maybe \"sorry we can seat you in an hour\" nope, nada, nothing.

Maybe they didn't want the walker in the lobby. Who knows enjoyed a great dinner at Portofino right next door.

A successful restaurant is so much more than great food. The food might have garnered more stars but as for the experience not so much!"}
{"text":"I could have ordered everything on the menu! We got the lobster mac as the appetizer. Delicious! My mom got duck wings, I got the triple choice sliders and my friend got the Cajun pasta. I thought everything was delicious. The service was very good, we sat in the dining area on the other side of the bar. It was a bit cramped and noisy but overall we shared a great experience there and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant  late on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was closed but the bar and lounge was open with a full restaurant menu. The menu has a nice selection of appetizers and main entrees. Since it was late I decided to order a hamburger with fries and chicken tortilla soup. The soup was excellent, served very hot and it was a little spicy. The Hamburger was absolutely fantastic, it was served on a buttered pretzel bun. It would be hard to go wrong with this tasty burger so do not hesitate to order it. The fries were crispy and just right. My dinner side kick ordered a salad and crab cake. I was told the salad was good and the crab cake was a little dry. 

Overall a very pleasant dinner with a good wait staff."}
{"text":"Hip spot, staff all seemed to be enjoying themselves. Bison bacon meatloaf w Brussel sprout side was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once for drinks and once for brunch. Both enjoyable experiences. 
At the bar I had my usual xtra dirty martini but not a lot of bartenders can make it right. It was delicious. She made us try the jalapeño infused tequila. Had a kick. Not bad. 

2nd time was for brunch. Bloody Mary's on point and my omelet was delicious. Definitely going back for another taste!"}
{"text":"Visited Harry's with a group of six people on a business trip.  The locals highly recommended and said it was their go to spot close to the office.  

We had a long day and were looking for a good meal with fast service.   Service was great, our drink order was taken a minute or so after we sat down and drinks were served quickly.  Great drink selection!!

I was looking for something a bit healthy and found it in the poached salmon with two side.  The salmon was cooked as ordered and the Brussels sprouts were caramelized and a bit crispy.  My favorite way to prepare them!! YUM!!!  The other side I ordered was the steamed veggies - wish I would have gone double Brussels sprouts!  They really were awesome! 

Overall, great place for a casual but great meal with terrific service."}
{"text":"A class act. . . loved this place and will plan to return when I visit Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Very poor quality of cuisine here. We ordered from sunday brunch menu, my husband had the eggs florentine and I had the omelet with creamy grits. Everything was made with very little vision or culinary talent. When they said creamy grits, instead of getting very nice fluffy grits perfectly balance with butter, milk, I got a bowl of soupy grits made with cream. The omelet was extremely greasy and over cooked- to the point it was browned ans crispy. The potato rounds were greasy. My husbands florentine said it sat on a bed of creamed spinach- what came was 3 poached eggs on top of spinach soup with lots of cream. The way they delivered their menu is very different from what Ive experienced elsewhere when it says \"bed of creamed spinach\". The waiter was very lackluster, we arrived when it was totally empty so he should not have been rushed or inattentive, but he was. He never smiled, didn't ask us anything but what we wanted, never offered any insight into the menu. I asked if my order came with a bread, he said no, so I asked what they had for bread and he said only thing they had was english muffin. However, we saw a breakfast sandwich on their menu with croissant, so we knew that was an option which he failed to offer. We asked about it and he said he could offer that as well.  I wont return here mainly for the food- its very amateur. Anyone can make creamy grits if they cook it in the same amount cream to the point its swimming in it. Sad the steele creek area has little brunch options - but I would opt for waffle house over this."}
{"text":"That grilled chicken sandwich is soooooo good. I drive out of my way to hit Harry's on the way home. So worth it. Cool place, nice employees, make the time to stop by."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem...  it's not often you can find a place that has a look and feel of your home town corner bar with food that would rival any high end restaurant.  Not to mention, has Kraft beer that I'll come back for...  well done!!!

Risotto was a little underdone, but the rack of lame and the lobster Mac-n-cheese were spot on."}
{"text":"Good food, wonderful service, and a good vibe. It was a little loud for our large group but would be fine for a table of 4 or smaller."}
{"text":"My second time here. I forgot to review it the first time. Shame on me. Had James as my server both times. He is awesome. The food is delicious and sweet potatoe fries are to die for. Love this place."}
{"text":"Pure perfection. Cannot say enough good things about the quality of food here...the sauces, texture, temperature, aromas. Service was also stellar. We had the Filet and Surf N Turf and we were both savoring the deliciousness. Even the salads were especially tasty, everything from scratch. Approximately $100 plus tip for meal and beers and worth every penny. Delightful experience."}
{"text":"Good bar/restaurant combo. Pretty girl behind the bar with a great can do attitude.  Farmhouse burger with sweet potato fries was very good. Egg cooked perfectly.  They have a bunch of craft beer on tap. I was here for lunch so I didn't partake in the alcoholic beverages. 
Private rooms for parties is a great addition to the place."}
{"text":"Very lovely tavern.  Best pimento cheese EVER!  And the jalapeño bacon jam?  TO DIE FOR.  That's all I can tell ya because we just stopped in for a quick beer & appetizer, but it was VERY worth it.  I'd definitely go back to try more."}
{"text":"First time here tonight.  Little busy but seated right away.  Brooks our waiter was outstanding.  
Had the Black Label burger and fries.  Amazingly delicious. 
Also the Meat Loaf and Brussels sprouts was AWESOME!!!!!
Love this place and def will be back!"}
{"text":"Best beer cheese soup and the duck wings are Awesome!! Wish Sunday had other things besides brunch items but everything we have had here has been great! Took some family for dinner one night and were disappointed the steaks and sides didn't have much flavor to them...good drink and a great spot to stop before or after a movie at ayrsley!"}
{"text":"What to say... My steak was really delicious albeit pricey. The sides are average. Waiter said the brussel sprouts were excellent, but they struck me as pretty flavorless. The risotto was okay. All-in-all a good place, but I would not go out of my way to eat there :("}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here! I liked the atmosphere, our waiter was attentive and my food was on point! I had the Maine Lobster Mac and Cheese, there was soooo much lobster! I tried to evenly distribute it amongst the Mac and cheese and still ended up with just lobster at the end. I would definitely recommend this place to people and would definitely come back! Well done!"}
{"text":"Good variety, friendly staff, and the sweet potato fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and good beer selection. Been here several times and it is really consistent."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and need to give credit to the consistently friendly and mostly attentive service I've gotten. Decent beer selection great appetizers and flatbreads. 

Warning though to vegetarians - I asked about chicken stock in the beer cheese soup and the polenta and was told two different things by two different servers! If you're serious about what ingredients go in your food, I'd be wary because I feel like I couldn't get a straight answer."}
{"text":"So I've eaten here quite a few times and only at lunch. I work in the complex so it's an easy place to grab food. I'll be honest the food just doesn't wow me. Pretty much like all of the restaurants here in Ayrsley. It's rather pricey for what it is and the quality isn't great. The chicken sandwich isn't too bad and normally I would say the sweet potato fries are the best thing about this place, but last week I got  a to go order and brought it back to work. My fries were burnt. I'm not sure what cook looked at that and thought yep that looks tasty.

 I have quite a few co-workers who have had issues there as well. At one point I guess it was the assistant manager came up to our office searching for someone who had left there unhappy. He was pushy and annoying and pushed his way into the office. I went into our secure area to find the person asked him to wait and he pushed himself in accosting her. It was very disconcerting and highly unprofessional and really just made me never want to eat there again. However again it's convenient so I ordered from there again. The burnt fries however was kind of the breaking point. They just have no care about their lunch patrons or their lunch quality. 

I assume dinner is better or if you are there for \"Sunday Funday\" and drinking. However if you're there for lunch and not drinking well you aren't going to fare well. I'll stick with Portofino's or risk losing my parking space to go elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"So this place is now Harry's. Before it was Red Lion a little while back. The place is the same inside, which is fine, because I liked it before. Nice, dark wood and a welcoming interior. It has a little couch/lounge area down the steps away from the bar (but it is still inside). They may get more people there if they had a larger outside patio. The beer and full bar have good selection. Our server made us a Hurricane and she did not use a mix, which I really like. I dont like the fake syrup stuff. It was just rums and juices. Good stuff! I ordered the lobster roll, which had great flavor and a Nova's bakery roll, but too much mayo. Nice place to grab a drink and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Went here last week with some friends/coworkers for dinner out. Their food is really good and hearty. Creamy tomato soup is homemade and delicious, OMG! I had crabcakes and green beans. Unlike many places, you will not be disappointed with the size of your two cakes. Their cakes are more hamburger sized, seasoned well and consist of pure lump crab meat. My coworker had the best hamburger ever, it had three types of meat including bison. I am a bacon burger fan and I must say, it was one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. I would come back just to have that burger. The fried duck wings were also good, almost like small chicken legs. Our server was very attentive.

Only drawback: If you are not familiar with the area, you have to look for the restaurant because it is kind of lost in a strip of businesses and residential buildings. Street parking is available if you can get it. I parked across the street at the movie theater. Interior is not also that large. Good as the food is, I can see the place filling up quickly with a long wait, but I could be wrong."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place in the area and where we take friends when they are in town. The food is consistently good and we love that they have small plates. The lobster mac & cheese is amazing! We've eaten there quite a few times and I've never had a bad experience. The wait staff are always very friendly and helpful. They have a room that is great for large groups, or you can just walk in and sit at the bar and grab a quick bite. They have a good selection of craft beers and nightly drink specials."}
{"text":"Well lets start with a positive, that Harrys is located in the \"town Ayrsley\". This was the first time I've dined here, and I was not throughly impressed with the menu. I had a large party of 7; 5 adults and 2 kids.  4 out of 5 adults ordered hamburgers. I myself actually ordered the NY strip, it was cooked to order (med rare)..but  it just wasn't very flavorful at all. One of the kids (my son) ordered the alfredo but it was so dry, not creamy at all. It lacked any flavor, so much so that it just tasted like plain noodles. My son and his friend both shared the pizza the other child ordered. I think a little more TLC needs to be put into these dishes to bring them to life. It would be nice if the menu was revamped to add more variety, I just felt like something was missing. My dining experience was nothing to write home about, and I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"Harry's has never let me down. Nice local place with really good food. The lunch menu is great and won't break your pocket. Dinner menu is a little pricier than one would think for a \"tavern\", but it's good. 

The atmosphere is cool &inviting. During the summer, they break out the corn hole and have comfortable outdoor seating available. 

I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and sweet potato fries (my absolute favorite meal at Harry's). The lobster mac and cheese is loaded with lobster and it's pretty good. The crab cake sandwich is another hit along with a few other items. However the mini steak sandwiches with au jus was not my favorite. 

Give Harry's a shot...you won't be disappointed :) Your all in one local spot!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area. First visit with California friends was a complete surprise. Outstanding ambiance and friendly staff. Lots of menu options. Took a chance on the Black Label burger - Good Choice. Lobster Mac & Cheese another good choice. Great service, very attentive and pro active. Numerous visits since my first and have never been disapointed. Special events are the best. Chef Mike is full of surprises with outstanding menu additions."}
{"text":"Food has always been good. Have been here several times for work lunches and events. Service is generally OK if sometimes a bit slow."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. However, a double call gin & soda was $24. I'm not sure where they get off charging $24 for 2oz of Hendricks gin when a bottle is 35-40 dollars. I spoke with a manager and he claimed that there were 6oz of gin in the drink. I can say with absolute certainty that there was not. First off, I would've felt that one drink in the same way I would've felt after 6 shots of 88 proof liquor taken in the course of an hour, which I didn't - not even close. Second, ice takes up about 7-8 ounces of a 16 ounce glass. Meaning, there would've only been room for 2-3 ounces of mixer and the drink would've tasted like almost straight booze, which it did not. Then there's the straight price of it. Even if it was a well (bottom shelf) liquor (and Hendricks most certainly is not) a shot would likely go for around $5. It's not likely they would take a $6 loss per double they poured. That would be an incredible hit to the restaurant's gross profit of an item which normally displaces the lower GP generated from the kitchen. Not wise to lie to a businessperson. 

On a positive note, the scallops were cooked perfectly and the brussels sprouts were flavored to a point that allowed the veg to still be tasted, yet complimented well by the simple flavoring of red onion and olive oil. Also, the server was kind, attentive and thoroughly apologetic about the absurd and possibly abusively high price of my one drink, which was 1.5 times the cost of my food. He still earned the just-shy-of-25% tip I left. 

Needless to say, I will not likely return to Harry's, unless they rethink their drink price arrogance and figure out why a manager feels it's okay to blatantly lie to customers. Maybe he thought I was stupid or maybe it's because he can tell I'm from the Northeast by my accent."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time and looking forward to my next visit. I got the filet mignon.  It was amazing. Perfect size, perfectly cooked. They get their meat from the same place as Ruth's Chris. Everyone was friendly. And the manager Jeffery came by and chatted with us for awhile. The atmospher is nice and I can't wait until the outside seating area is done and they start getting in some live entertainment. Check it out. A must. I wish them the best of luck."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always clean, tasty, and the best battered sweet potato fries I've had.
I recommend the black label burger or the bison meatloaf. The fish and flatbreads are ok. I think the lobster mac has huge potential but could be more flavorful.

The pimento and artichoke are also great, and I look forward to trying dessert.

Edit: Shout out to Jenny behind the bar for great service and wonderful recommendations!!

Happy eating yelpers!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  You'd expect to find the 20 to 50-something white collar crowd at this place.

Went here on a Tuesday night for an early dinner (6pm) and found the staff very friendly and attentive.  I actually sat at the bar but did order any drinks, just dinner.  I did however look at the wine list and found around 15 bottles each of whites and reds, primarily California, 3x pricing with most expensive bottle around $45-$50.

Dinner: I tried their Chilled Sesame Noodles small plate, then I had the Seared Salmon encrusted with Panko and Dijon large plate.  The small plate was pretty good.  It came with julienne carrots and zucchini.  The Salmon was good but by the end was too rich as I could also taste plenty of butter.  Honestly, what I liked most were the spinach polenta cakes which came with the Salmon.  Harry, the owner (very friendly guy) came by a few times to check on me and asked me is I was enjoying the meal.  I commented on the how good the polenta cakes were and he told me they made the polenta in-house and fresh daily so it explained why it was so tasty - but this too was a little rich.

I almost dropped the rating down to 3 stars due to how rich the large plate meal was, especially since normally Salmon is typically a healthy meal, bur since the polenta was so darn good and the Salmon overall was also good I just can't penalize them to 3 stars for such a good meal."}
{"text":"It might be a gastropub, but tonight I came for a sports bar. Great bartenders, salmon was solid, and the regulars were friendly and fun. Plus they put on the Spurs game. About all you can ask out of a bar on the road."}
{"text":"This place rocks! They have a creative menu with delicious and fun items -- think lobster mac,crab cakes, bison meatloaf, andouille sausage sliders, tapas, lots of salads, steaks and a lot more. Everything I've had is prepared with quality and finesse that is a big step above your typical bar food.

VERY friendly and helpful staff and a comfortable bar atmosphere. 

Just a block away from The Hilton Garden Inn makes this place perfect for a business traveler like me."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and drink wine. Love the bar and staff. I would prefer more vegetarian choices on food."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed about this place. We read the reviews and the hotel highly recommended this place. The fillets were not good at all. Sent them back and came out the same. The waiter was awful. Only reason for three stars was for the manger he was good and try to make it right."}
{"text":"Service is okay. Food flavors in foods, but mediocre execution. Gordon Ramsay would be pissed, because the risotto was undercooked. The atmosphere and marketing is better than the food and service. I would consider it a good dinner if the meals were $5-10 less."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a snack after seeing the Avengers. I wasn't too terribly hungry but my friends wanted to swing by so we did. 

While I did not order anything, I got to taste the hummus & pita bread.  YUM! It was fresh and very flavorful a perfect snack. 

Service was great! I wish I was hungry so I could have tried their dinner! Oh well.  

If you are staying in the Homewood Suites near Aysley, this place is within walking distance."}
{"text":"Great food, staff and environment. What more could you want!?"}
{"text":"always a great experience. The food is wonderful the staff is wonderful. Great place to have a party too!"}
{"text":"Busy during weekday lunch with professionals from the area. Has a good selection of salads, burgers and sandwiches. Lunch combo for soup/salad are well portioned. They have 2 separate entrances, one for the bar and one for dining. Reasonably priced. Sweet potato fries for the win as well."}
{"text":"Brunch!  On a lazy Saturday, not many folks in the restaurant, but a very delicious salmon eggs Benedict and potato patties were rapidly consumed by yours truly. Staff were attentive and friendly, prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was casual and comfy. I'll stop in for dinner next time!"}
{"text":"I go out of my way to come here. The steaks are UNREAL. In fact, it's all amazing. 
The duck wings are A+. The Surf and Turf is sublime. The charcuterie? Ridiculously good. 
Cracker-Jack staff. Delectable infusions. Great atmosphere. Pricey, but dang... take my money."}
{"text":"Awesome location.  Menu is full of surprises. Full bar with drink suggestions. Duck wings were crispy, meaty and succulent. Scallops were the best I have ever eaten.  Tuxedo cake was drool worthy.  The kids selection of sliders were adult worthy.  Customer service was rushed and so details were missed. Food will bring me back again."}
{"text":"We are thrilled that Ayrsley finally has a place where we can consider ourselves to be \"regulars\".  This is definitely NOT just another bar.  

The atmosphere is modern and classy.  The attention they pay to detail is evident in the preparation of the food.  There are some creative and eclectic small plate items on the menu as well as entree options.  Several varieties of burgers are available including a burger of the day.  I have tried several of them and have been blown away each time.  There are a number of local craft beers on draft as well which I really appreciate as a fan of the local beer scene.  This place is truly a great addition to the neighborhood and is highly recommended for anyone who likes high quality food in a comfortable and trendy environment."}
{"text":"Rarely do the dining gods allow such a combination of food quality, drink indulgence and service mastery. Thanks for a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Cool wood panel classic atmosphere for meal and a drink.  Got crab cake sandwich.  Very good!"}
{"text":"This location has excellent service and the food was great! It is located in a nice center with a movie theatre and bowling alley close by. I got a Farmhouse burger and it was very sizable as well as affordable! The fries are delicious as well! If you ever find yourself in the small town of Ayrsley, I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Quick service, clean, friendly staff, beer cheese soup and grown up grilled cheese were perfect portion size and delicious.  Only complaint is it's a bit confusing to find coming from the parking garage-more signage would be great!"}
{"text":"A otherwise nestled away beaut of a eatery is Harry's. I first found this spot s few years ago in the midst of my evening stroll around the arsyley community. Harry's is a fabulous location for that intimate rendezvous, business gathering or first date showoff spot. Today's fair is wings and sweet potato fries. They also make an awesome mushroom burger worthy of many repeat digesting...  Wonderful setting...Great food..  Perfect for me in that its walking distance from my house, and just enough of a walk back go help digestion from overeating...."}
{"text":"My kids and I wandered into Harry's on a Saturday afternoon hungry, hot and hoping to find a Nebraska game on.  We had walked out of BT's in Rivergate because the line was out the door.  I needed a hot burger, a cold beer and a side of sweet potato fries STAT!

WOW!!!! My blue cheese hamburger and sweet potato fries were spectacular!! I enjoyed a Triple C smoked amber served in a frosty glass while the NE game played on EVERY television. I had asked our server to please switch it to the game.  Go Big Red!

The servers were friendly and attentive. The restaurant was clean, cool and empty!!! The televisions were clear and plentiful.  They had a variety of ales and lagers with some unique brews. They even had OMB on tap! The prices were fair and the food was excellent!!

So where was (is) everybody??  This place should have a line out the door!! I have been back three times since our first visit and have experienced the same level of service. The food continues to be amazing! The place is clean and cool with a cozy ambiance. 

My daughter had a big, delicious oriental salad with lots of goodies on it. My husband (the picky eater) had the pesto burger (special) and raved about it for days.  The fries are thick and crispy. The tomatoes slices were huge. Even the pickles were fantastic. Everything just tastes fresh and good.
I eat out OFTEN and am hard pressed to give a Yelp review unless a place knocks my socks off!!!  I give Harry's 5 stars because after 4 visits this place has yet to disappoint!! 

PS. I was fortunate to experience the Double Decker Pumpkin desert last Saturday. This is Harry's pumpkin cheesecake with (made from scratch) pumpkin cake and cinnamon Mascarpone mousse, then topped with a caramel glaze. This sensational seasonal desert is reason enough to stop by Harry's!!"}
{"text":"Greatly enjoyed! From the minute we walked in, the manager and waitstaff were extremely welcoming. We sat in the bar area and had an awesome waiter named Jackson that was attentive and friendly. Started with the lobster mac&cheese, and then my boyfriend had the bison meatloaf with mashed potatoes and I had a Grecian salad with sirloin. We also had two of their specialty cocktails. Everything was outstanding! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love going to Harry's, whether it be for brunch and bloody Mary's or dinner on Friday nights. The burgers are always a good pick. The menu has a variety of items, including crab cakes, steak, pasta, flatbreads and of course, tons of specialty burgers. You can't go wrong with what you pick. There's usually a drink special going on that accompanies the burger of the day. 

We enjoy ordering the small plates occasionally, especially the fried brie and pimento cheese! While Harry's looks like your run of the mill bar/tavern from the outside, it will surprise you once you go inside. Recommend sitting in the bar area over the dining area. The staff is friendly and usually very fast with service."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in awhile but decided to have dinner prior to a movie. Staff was friendly and helpful. Duck wings were really tasty! You don't need any of the sauces offered. Caesar salad was good---not really a good judge of salads but it was fine. Had one of the flatbreads---it was ok, a little too much cheese for this thin crust pizza, IMO. I would recommend this place....they supposedly have a a great burger. Several other items on the menu caught my eye if I wanted a more full entree for dinner."}
{"text":"Happy with the beer cheese soup, salad and slider trio that I ordered. Service was solid and good atmosphere for the solo diner."}
{"text":"I came here on New Years Eve, and we pretty much just had an appetizer and a drink and that pretty much sums up my experience. The bartenders were nice and very accommodating of what we needed. We just got a hummus dip which came with three dips and that was pretty much all we got as we had dinner just an hour before. This was our last meal of 2017 and it was then filled with just drinking for the rest of the night.  They have a spacious bar and nice facilities. I wish I had more of an appetite as I would have more of their food, as I believe this place was on my list for a long while. Their service and company were great so I will definitely revisit this place and try out the food whenever I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"My first visit to Harry's I tried the Hawaiian and grilled chicken flat breads and they both lacked flavor to say the least. They are a bit smaller than flat bread's I've tried in the past but that would've been okay had they not tasted so bland. On the upside they do make their own infused liquor and the beer list here is solid. Maybe I will give the food here another try in the future."}
{"text":"While staying at one of the hotels near Harry's I thought I'd walk down and enjoy a nice meal, the positive Yelp reviews had me looking forward to finding a new local
place. Well, I left without eating a thing. After flagging down the the bartender I managed to get a beer. She gave me a menu and said \"I'll be right back\". Well after two other separate couples sat down at the bar near me and were serve their drinks and refills and their food order was taken I had to ask someone else to have her come four spots further down the bar to where I was sitting. My beer glass was empty, and had been for quite sometime, so I just ask her for my check. I paid my tab and left without eating a thing. There are way too many restaurants around here to be ignored.
On the plus side the beer was good and cold but I can get that anywhere. I was really looking forward to lobster Mac and Cheese and a burger. I guess we'll never know."}
{"text":"Everything was incredible.  The signature burger, a beer flight tailored to my tastes, the service and follow up, the atmosphere and the price.  Very hard to beat!  Very!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My second visit to Harry's and I will definitely be back for more! The service, food and attention to details was refreshing! The filet and Parmesan risotto was melt in your mouth delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm very underwhelmed by this restaurant. Harry's seemed like it had promise but it just wasnt to my liking. 
Price: the food was really overpriced, everything was about 5$ too expensive.
The menu: The menu has a very small selection and not much variance. It seemed like they had a few things on the menu that stuck out.
The ambiance: Seems really \"date-nightish\". Dim warm yellow pendant lantern lights and candle light. The booths where long and spacious, so you have lots of room, but also high, so you feel like your in your own little spot, not being crowded.
The taste: The all important taste test. I am a burger guy for sure, so I ordered the Black Label Burger. The composition was ok... They put the vegetables on the side, so the cheddar cheese sticks to the bun which makes it hard to pull apart. I think the burger may have under-seasoned because it had little flavor other than the bacon and unseasoned beef. They also don't pat the bacon dry before putting it in the burger, and the burger was really juicy, which is a good thing, but it ended up being very greasy and soggy by the end. Nothing was unappetizing or gross, but I think all in all, it may be best to look for something somewhere else."}
{"text":"We tried Harry's again since we had a Living Social deal.  I really wanted to like it, but it seems to be suffering from an identity crisis.  Is it a restaurant with fine wines, brie and mango chutney appetizers and $27 surf and turf, or is it a bar with $5 Whiskey Wednesdays and \"pre-made\" flatbreads?  Unfortunately, it's both, and the two don't gel.

The fella made a wiser decision than me and got the meatloaf, which had an almost smoky, barbecue flavor to it.  The side of Brussels sprouts were solid - a little garlic and lemon provided a nice flavor - but they're generally pretty hard to mess up.  I got the chicken flatbread and asked the waiter to leave off the tomatoes.  He very nicely said he'd see if they could do that since the flatbreads are pre-made.  Um, 'scuse me?  He checked with the kitchen and said they could do it.  Unfortunately, it tasted like it was straight out of a Stouffer's box; the crust was way too thick and doughy, and the toppings were bland.

Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, Harry's, shame on me."}
{"text":"Best brunch and american food in town! You gotta try the French toast and pretzel bun burger!"}
{"text":"Bottom-line... Good, albeit, pricey food served up with tasty drinks.

Harry's Grille & Tavern in Arsley is a pretty classy joint. They have many styles of seating to choose from. There is a traditional dining area, tavern seating with bar height tables, a lounge area with couches and an outdoor patio. They serve up classed up bar favorites. They always have a special of some sort worth trying. I've enjoyed everything that I've tried. For those didn't know, I'm somewhat of a sweet potato fry connoisseur. Harry's serves some killer sweet potato fries. Up there with my faves in Charlotte. Vanilla battered, thin cut and served perfectly crunchy. I'll ask them to go easy on the salt next time, though. Otherwise, I'll be leaving with hypertension!

Their bar serves up some great drinks and the service has always been friendly. They have a brunch menu (served Sat & Sun 11-4)  I'm interested in checking out. Did someone say $10 bottomless mimosas?! Maybe they'll make me a beer-mosa!

Housekeeping notes... Plenty of parking. I've never seen it get that busy, but I'm usually there at off times. A great place to grab a drink before/after a movie!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, groups, lunch. I have tried many things on the menu and while nothing fails, nothing has blown me away. Service is great, good atmosphere  for cocktails with friends or coworkers. I would steer somewhere else for a \"great\" meal. Today I tried the spinach salad & added a crab cake...salad was good, crab cake flavor was off...sweet, heavy breading...almost like stale bread was used...it was odd. Sandwiches/burgers have been much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurants I've been to recently. We went for lunch. My girlfriend had the crab cake sandwich and I had the grilled chicken sandwich.  Both were amazing. Every time the staff walked by with plates we couldn't stop staring and imagining coming back to try each of the dishes we saw. I will definately be back with my husband. Great job!"}
{"text":"Harry's continues to impress with friendly service and great food.  It's a little pricey, but worth it.  I feel welcome here.  On my most recent visit it was freezing outside.  What a welcome sight to see Brian's smiling face at the bar, suggesting the perfect wine.  I'm a little old fashioned and also think the bartender's uniforms with dress shirts and suit vests are very classy.

I met a couple of friends at the bar for drinks, then we moved to the dining room for a dinner of small plates.  When we requested a warm table away from the door, the host accommodated immediately with a smile.  We experienced great service throughout the meal, with visits from the server at appropriate times and team service to deliver the food so that we all got our dinners in unison.  Ahhhh....how nice. 

The crab cake is solid.  I'm super-fussy about sub-standard cutting-corners fishy crabmeat in the expensive cakes that many restaurants serve, but Harry's has nailed it with a great recipe - with plenty of lump crab!  I had the small plate with Asian pear slaw, which was a nice accompaniment.  A few of us had salads, and the ingredients (including produce in the middle of winter) are high-quality here.  They don't serve their dressing on the side of salads in a flimsy plastic containers with lids, a terrible practice beginning to settle in at even nicer establishments.

One person at our table ordered the lobster mac and cheese, which looked delicious and decadent, and two others enjoyed the night's small plate special, three lamb \"lollipops\" served with brussels sprouts.  What an excellent selection, and impressive gamble on brussels sprouts (which were excellent!).

I certainly hope Harry's keeps it fresh and stays in Ayrsley for a long long time."}
{"text":"Delicious  recommend the bison meatloaf and the southern sliders. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not from the area and need a nice tasty meal?  Harry's is it! The black label burger was pure!  Easily one of the beat burgers I've ever had.  The pretzel bun was a nice touch and the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! However, I do think this restraint should be $$$ not $$. I thought Duck wings were okay but my husband did not like them at all. The crab cakes were very good but they were stingy with the sauce. The sautéed vegetables left something to be desired yet the sweet potato fries were scrumptious."}
{"text":"Went here for a corporate happy hour. The food was very good, even if it was just \"heavy apps\" and the local beer selection was great. I did sample just a few of the 30+ on tap. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I'm visiting in Charlotte and a friend came up from Greenville to have lunch. What do we do? We look on Yelp for a place to have lunch. We wanted wine, too, so we found Harry's had good reviews. 
My dining partner and I each had a glass of wine and the lobster macaroni and cheese. This is listed as an appetizer on the menu, but believe me, it is more than adequate for an entree. And, it has nice pieces of lobster in it, not just tiny flakes. It was REALLY good!!! Delicious!
Brooks was our server and he was very attentive, friendly, and wonderful.
What a wonderful experience to add to my visit in Charlotte. 
Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Burger was outstanding. Good selection of craft beers.  Very friendly staff. I'll certainly come back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"The overall rating of this restaurant was four stars to me. It would of been five but the Maine lobster \"Mac n cheese\" didn't even have a Mac n cheese texture. It was also super bland. But on the bright side, my boyfriend's Cajun shrimp pasta was great. The booths in the dining room are huge, I'll come again; but not for the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"They make really good bloody marys and have a nice selection of craft beer. The food is overpriced for the quality. The philly cheesteak is $13 and they charge an extra $1 to add jalapenos, which is a little ridiculous. Our friends love this place, but it's just ok."}
{"text":"Had lunch today good food good prices
Waiter was nice and cleaned off table before I had my
lunch
Had ice water and wanted lemon with it but no lemon 
Ordered black coffee which was ok but was never asked if I wanted a refill 
Place was crowded 
Will go back"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance! This place could totally be my living room!  I love the various options for seating: bar, lounge chairs/sofa, booths, tables.  The decor is very swank and modernistic ;-)

I visited because there was an \"Art Wine Down\" event being hosted here, which was great! So I decided to stay for dinner.  I had the chicken risotto which was delicious (or perhaps I was starving). It had a very homey taste to it and was certainly plentiful. 

Staff was cool although my waitress was a tad annoying with the frequency of her checking up on me. Surprisingly despite it being a Saturday evening, the place remained somewhat bare. Perhaps too much to do in Charlotte ;-) The menu is moderate and they offer a variety of wines.  I would certainly visit again and recommend trying this place.

There was parking available on the street, but there is also a structure and a lot behind the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Place is whack. Went here for brunch today  and was SUPER disappointed.. First off, let's start the food. I ordered the usual brunch I typically  enjoy. Basic eggs Benedict. The eggs was over Cooked with no yolk running. The hash browns is salty. The \"ambiance\" was dead- literally was separated from bar and dinner lounge with about 4 other people in there when we arrived.  We arrived around 230.. Anyways, my mimosa was good at first (bottomless mimosa) after literally two glasses our waitress comes by with a pitcher full of orange juice and filled my cup. I knew for a fact that it was orange juice and not champagne due to the other two patrons in the restaurant that had to send back there glasses. When I called the waitress over to tell her I prefer a mimosa n not orange juice, her face was blushed and said it was mimosa\" she refilled my mimosa and I got my check. Please.. Don't come here for Sunday funday! The place is awkward. No music. the watered down the bottomless mimosas was a joke."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer.  Sweet potato fries were great.  Salad was wonderful.  I'll be back.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"We came here spur of the moment on Father's Day and were well taken care of. Great service and food with a small Father's Day staff says a lot about mgmt."}
{"text":"Just happened to walk in this bar for a cocktail after we saw a movie at the Ayryllis theater. Cool bar kind of loungey they have a huge selection of liqueurs some vodka whiskey a and tequila homemade infused drinks. Martinis were delish the staff was super friendly I didn't try any food but did notice they had a Sunday brunch with bottomless mimosas and an awesome menu  so I will be checking that out keep ya posted"}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon wrapped ribeye, it was really good. The server was friendly but obviously the place was busy so things were but rushed. In general good food and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"My normal lunch routine has consisted of cheap, fast food contraptions and bowls of Progresso soup. So, a change in food was very much needed. My co-workers mentioned this restaurant a while ago. Today, I decided to feed my culinary curiosity and order lunch for my co-worker (aka my lunch homie) and I. Harry's Grill and Tavern, here we come! Here are some of the items that we ordered :

Mapleleaf Farms Duck Wings w/Bourbon BBQ sauce and Jicama Slaw

1) Initially, the chicken looked a little parched. Last night's chicken? Ummm, I hope not. However, the taste was decent. Portion size was good. 

2) The Jicama slaw was an excellent take on slaw. Traditional slaw (cabbage) can sometimes become very boring. However, the Jicama put a nice spin on it. The lunch homie, though, with her traditionalist, non-risk taking tongue, let the slaw fall gently from her mouth. You can't please every palate.  

Small Mixed Green Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette and Mac - N - Cheese - Lunch Combo

1) Harry's Mac - N - Cheese was the greatest joy that I experienced during this meal! The consistency and texture was great...not too dry and not loose...just creamy goodness in my belly! The levels of cheesiness was outstanding. And the light sprinkling of panko crumbs provided that last bit of contrast and crunch. The Comfort Food gods have bestowed their blessings on this particular dish.

2) Bought the Small Mixed Green salad to eat for dinner. The portion size definitely small, but it's packed with some good stuff. Can't wait to get my greedy hands on it later this evening!
 
Harry Old Fashioned Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Fries

1) My lunch homie ordered a Harry's Old Fashion Burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. I snagged a few and they were good. I've ordered sweet potato fries at other establishments and I've always needed additional condiments (i.e. Honey Mustard sauce)  to add some taste. However, we both agreed that these fries were great by themselves. The slight sweetness of vanilla gave the side item a little more depth, while the salt reminds you that it's still a fry.

She was less enthusiastic about her burger, though. I believed she said that she had better times with a BK Whopper. Hey, I'm not a burger connoisseur,  so who am I to judge? The presentation of the burger was well put together. Wasn't sloppy or unappealing. Just your typical pub burger waiting to be consumed.

All items were moderately priced. My tab totaled to 31.12. Our lunch take out order was timely ( ready in 15 minutes) and accurate. Great location and if you're a non-parallel parker such as myself, they have easy access to the restaurant from the parking garage.  I will definitely return to see what Harry's has to offer for dinner and brunch. I must try the Lobster Mac - N - Cheese!!!"}
{"text":"I happened by this place last night, I was immediately impressed by the friendliness of the staff. They introduce themselves then ask for your name and remember it. They have a great selection of beer on tap and were knowledgeable about each one. My wife had the same experience when choosing a wine. They are also very quick to offer a taste of one of the beers or wine to see what you like. On to the food, wow. I did not have very high expectations and the knocked it out of the park. Caprese salad was delicious. Hummus was great though they should either have super fresh pita or warm it up. Crab cakes in the top 5 that I have ever had, my wife says maybe the best she has ever had. Salmon salad came with a big piece of nicely cooked salmon. Trio of sliders was very good. I also had the 5 spice pork with mango salsa, nicely cooked but I did not love the flavor, something tasted off. Great atmosphere and the staff makes up for any deficiency there was in the food."}
{"text":"Won't overdo it on this one. Average food in a welcoming atmosphere. Beer was cold. Duck wings were good, the dipping sauces ok.
Menu is fairly well written and they advertise a signature burger with a customs house formulation. Sounded exciting and ended up underwhelming me. Not bad but don't drive too far out of your way"}
{"text":"This place was so good I had to go back the next day! I'm not sure who Harry is, but I need to find and thank him for the deliciousness that his restaurant whips up. We dropped in on a Saturday while exploring the area, and were seated immediately. It was around 3pm but we were presented with a brunch menu, which was nice. Their brunch runs until 4pm on Sat and Sun. I had to go with the shrimp and grits and it was very good. All of the flavors meshed well and it had a great balance. The amount of food provided was great. The next day, I went back for brunch again and this time ordered the blueberry french toast. This was some of the best french toast I've ever had. The blueberry mixture on top was so great, I really didn't even need syrup. I definitely have to go back and try some of the dinner menu items when I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Good place, quick service.
Fried brie was really tasty. Trio of sliders a bit on the dry side, but good overall."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos are to die for!  My husband got the Angus Burger, and it's probably the best I  have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"We are just slightly obsessed with Harry's. First of all, the atmosphere is great. Very welcoming and cozy. The staff is very nice, attentive and helpful. Second, if you want the best sweet potato fries ever ... this is the place to go. They have a slight hint of vanilla which is different yet absolutely delicious. My personal favorite is the Pulled Pork Bourbon Tacos. I am drooling just thinking about them! Lucky for me, I live in the neighborhood so I can pop in anytime ;)"}
{"text":"We went to Harry's hoping to find a regular spot to hang out and have a few drinks. The atmosphere was calm but still lively (on a Monday night). I had the culinary dip sliders and they were fantastic. Harry's has an upscale atmosphere so the prices were complementary to that atmosphere. We will be back to Harry's."}
{"text":"Round 1 at Harry's was for some appetizers and drinks at the bar.   The bartender was great!   Shared beer cheese soup and tavern pimento cheese.   Tempted by the lobster mac and cheese but not enough room since we had some hh appetizer's at Mac's first.   The pimento cheese and the soup are made in house and both really good.    So we decided to repeat this place breaking our own rules of no repeats in Charlotte while there for 2 weeks on business.  Round 2-
Fried brie-with apple compote , mango chuntey and balsamic reduction.   This was a 3 for me.  After having an exceptional blacked brie a few days earlier this seemed more like a dessert to me and less impressive.   For our entrees we both got the same meal.  Harry's surf and turf.  can't beat it for 24.00!  And with 2 sides.   Us both being the carb addicts we are we opted for the roast garlic whipped potatoes and spinach polenta cake.   Both get 5s.    I should know by now i can't get a good crab crab in Charlotte except at Del Friscos but it was worth a shot.   it gets a 3.  The steak had a nice flavor and was cooked correctly-rare.  A little tough but for the price i was okay with it.  No dessert.   I just really like the atmosphere in here."}
{"text":"I love a gourmet burger and this place has a fabulous burger: great quality meat, sharp cheddar cheese, crispy bacon and on a toasted pretzel roll.  I substituted fries for Brussels spouts and they were delicious. They have an expansive list of local beers on draft, with representation from many of Charlotte's local breweries.  I'd pass on the beer cheese soup next time; it wasn't very flavorful or creamy."}
{"text":"I was told about this place by a neighbor so I looked at all the reviews and felt I needed to try it.  It's located in a nice little area with many storefronts.   We started out with the fuckin duck wings, sorry for the rhetoric but that's my mood today.  They were pretty good, not something I would try again, like chicken wings better.  Then the broad I was with has the chicken salad sangwhich with tasted good as I stole a bite.  Sandwiches are rather big, I had the slightly blackened salmon tacos which were cooked perfectly to my liking.   The sweet potato fries had a hint of vanilla and were delectable.   We also had hicama  slaw for the first time and enjoyed that as well.  The service was great, greeted as soon as we entered the joint and the waitress was great.  We saw a lot of nice dishes coming from the kitchen that looked incredible,  especially the lobster macaroni and cheese, I will be trying it next time.  They give you large portions of food for lunch, good thing I'm retired because there is no way I would be going back to work after a meal line that, nap time.  It looks like it would be a great place to go for a cocktail at night, nice long L - shaped bar."}
{"text":"Love it they make a great martini and a manhattan and their bar food is fab... Nice place to meet friends for drinks ..."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best meal I have ever eaten. Ordered the crab cake dinner; better than any crab cake I've eaten in Maryland! Our waiter Jackson was so fun, and made our evening!"}
{"text":"How many more stars are available? Any more than 5?

The small plates menu is amazing.
Had the spinach salad with fab red wine vinaigrette that reflected the use of top ingredients. Hubby had the creamy tomato soup that was rich in texture.
We shared the Maine lobster Mac and cheese and then dueled for the culinary dip sliders!

Nicki and Jessica treated us so well and led us to the perfect selections.

Make it a point to visit and sample the extraordinary menu."}
{"text":"We were a party of 8, the only table at the bar with maybe one or 2 people sitting at the bar. For what it was the service was kind of slow. I think the food is way overpriced fit what it was. I tasted almost everyone's did at our table and everything was pretty bland. The one and only thing that was perfect was the lobster macaroni and cheese!!! It is amazing!! All in all this place was alright. I may try it again and give it another shot."}
{"text":"My husband had a shrimp flat bread pizza which was okay. I had the \"special\" of the day which was trout stuffed with crab and spinach. The trout did not taste fresh, guess that is why it was the special of the day - my bad... The piece they served was really small and the crab and spinach it was supposed to be stuffed with were barely noticeable. to make matters worse the fish was not seasoned. My bill for the small portioned trout \"special\" was $33... Shame on me for not asking the price, but really $33 - that is way too much to charge at this restaurant/grille and for a cheap fish such as trout...The waiter was great and deserves to work at someplace better than this. We will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise! We had dinner at this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised how good it was :-) I have the crab cake dinner with a side of mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts, my meal was excellent! The staff was all friendly and the environment was pleasant!"}
{"text":"This was too bad, it looked nice and the food looked good.  Other than continually being referred to as \"Boss\" by the server, he got my very simple order wrong several times.  The cook came from the kitchen and asked \"What's wrong?\"  When there was really nothing wrong.  Nobody had even complained.  They took part of the meal off--which was cool.  It just could have been a better experience overall for the price paid."}
{"text":"The club sandwich I had was decent. It's one of those \"we put a spin on it\" deals, part of which I liked (the bread: hoagie in lieu of the usual tri-level) and not so much (the lettuce: something \"fancy\" and tangy where I prefer iceberg's crunch). The fries were good -- not too thin or too thick -- and they were served fresh and hot. The service was friendly, but we waited a while on refills. I would return, possibly to try a burger."}
{"text":"Spectacular experience! Enjoyed an incredibly delicious meal in a relaxed atmosphere. Service was good. Would definitely recommend and will be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Two stars just because of the atmosphere.
Came in for drinks before a movie to underwhelming service. Wait staff could not keep orders straight, even though the bar was barely 1/4 full.
Beer keg ran out midway thru a pour & when that was pointed out to to the manager, he was defensive and condescending. Mixed drinks  were ok."}
{"text":"On a business trip to Charlotte a co-worker and I went here for dinner. Nice selection of 16 local craft beers to chose from. For dinner we split the lobster Mac and cheese. I have had better but it was still very good. We both ordered the surf and turf which consisted of broiled scallops and a petit center cut ribeye,2 sides were included so I chose the whipped mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. The dinner was really good. Fairly priced and our server was excellent."}
{"text":"Love Love Love! The lobster Mac and cheese was absolutely amazing along with my burger. My friend and I went for lunch and it was exactly what we needed. I'm excited to come back for dinner and try the Cajun shrimp pasta so I can give them a full 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Harry's.  The manager told us they have only been open about 3 months.  I can tell you that if they keep serving food as good as it was today, they will get very popular.  I had one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  Cooked perfectly and not just thrown together.  I had the regular french fries which were good, but my wife had the sweet potato fries which were the best I've ever tasted. We were ther on Sunday for lunch and didn't have any drinks but it looks like they have some great specials.  I will be going back!!"}
{"text":"We came in for brunch as the menu looked so yummy. There was no one at the front desk, we had to wait around for a few minutes. We were the only ones in the restaurant so you would think our server would have been more attentive. Empty glasses sat unfilled for some time and it took forever for our order to come but when it did it was quite delicious. The eggs were cooked to perfection, rich and light at the same time. The presentation is so pretty you almost don't want to eat it at first. Not too much food and not too little, just right and at the right price for brunch. So I give it three stars because of the lack of service but the food was pretty great."}
{"text":"Best CrabCakes EVER!!! 

It's Sunday Funday! I booked a reservation on Open Table, I was seated right away. Our waiter was super friendly! He had the best jokes!!! I was hoping to enjoy the endless mimosas special. Please note this offer is no longer offered! I was so bummed.

My friend and I purchased bottle of champagne For $12. This worked out perfect! We could make our own mimosas!

This was my fist time visiting. I live close by, of course I've never had the pleasure of dining here. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict with a side of Andouille Sausage! So amazing!!  I thought about ordering the shrimp and grits but decided to pass. My friend ordered it! The smell and presentation were EVERYTHING !!!! 

I cannot wait to return!!! I wanted to try the Lobster Mac & Cheese. I've heard good things! I may host a ladies brunch in the near future! I noticed an empty room for larger parties. This could be useful!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes me so happy. Nestled on Ayrsley Town Center Blvd., Harry's is fine dining at an affordable price. I've come here for brunch and everything has been amazing.

The crab cake benedict was SO GOOD and plated so well. They also have really good build your own omelets. My bf has gotten the shrimp and grits and he raves about it; I plan on trying it during my next visit.

They offer specialty cocktails. The peach honey bourbon tea is amazingggg. The bourbon is infused w/ peaches & honey. OMGosh, I heart it so much!!

The bartender is so friendly and accommodating. You'll never feel neglected as a patron."}
{"text":"Great variety of burgers.  The Big Mess BBQ is great!!  Nice big bar and TV's for sports."}
{"text":"Went with my team on a \"business trip.\" I got the surf n turf since there were a ton of pictures but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. However the appetizers (lobster mac n cheese and crab cake) were delicious and my team members loved their NY prime steaks. The parmesan risotto is definitely a side you want to get too!"}
{"text":"The service was lacking,  very unattentive and it wasn't very busy.  As far as the food,  the lobster Mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever had.  You would be shorting yourself by not taking advantage of that dish.  Wine selection was great and the salmon was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had and the Cajun shrimp pasta was delicious"}
{"text":"We went to this place on a Sunday after driving around Charlotte for almost an hour. Obviously we are not from the area, but I have to admit the good was outstanding and the best part was the endless Mimosas! The staff was amazing, kept our glasses full and definitely our tummy's happy! Def recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Harry's is a upscale restaurant with a very modern bar. The ambience is nice, warm and inviting. This is a great place for a romantic dinner.

The service was the best I've had in a while! Ashley was so exciting, helpful and attentive, she's the best!

The lobster mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, parmesan risotti and the burger were very good. The only downside was that we didn't like the fried duck wings, maybe it's just our taste buds. We will be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I see Five and Four star reviews, guess if you like over priced/cooked burgers and dry food, this your place, and I gave it two chances, and both times sucked.
I live here and the only thing I've tasted that is decent at Harry's is the beer, and french fries.  If you want good food, head over to the Piedmont Social House which is owned by them too."}
{"text":"Waited on a glass of wine for 15 minutes and the waiter wasn't very with it. The food was great especially the chicken. The main downside is the price point."}
{"text":"I have tried Harry's lunch and dinner and neither have provided a great value. However, Harry's as a bar has really grown on me. So I will keep this review to the \"Tavern\" part of Harry's Grille & Tavern.

We went last Saturday night to take advantage of their $4 craft beer special. The band that was playing was totally on point (I didn't catch the name but they play the first Saturday of every month). They played a lot of covers of mellow 90s songs. They were laughing and joking around with the bartender. The whole set up created a really great vibe.

Our bartender, Nikki, was friendly and made sure to check on us throughout the night. We tried some of their infusions and enjoyed the peach whiskey but not so much the rum infusion. A nearby patron ordered wine and seeing the generous pour I did the same. 

Overall it was a fun and laid back bar environment with a local bar ambiance. The prices were great for the craft beers and for the generosity of the wine pour. We don't go out in Ayrsley as often since it is no longer within walking distance but we will return to Harry's next time we are out that way."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. But was really disappointed in the mashed potatoes. It was a cross between box powdered *yuck* and seemed cornmealy... not sure if it's a southern style mashed tater but neither me or my bf could eat more than one bite.... the sweet potato fries, Brussels sprouts and lobster macs were amazing though!! Will definitely come back, but will never order mashed potatoes here.




UPDATE: order today was okay, was disappointed with the very tiny portion of asparagus for 4 bucks in comparison to the portions of all other sides ordered. But what I am most upset about were the salads... had two Cobb salads both had nasty lettuce throughout, and even an entire \"butt\" of the romaine stall which took up significant room where there could've been more actual lettuce. Out of both salads only half was edible due to the disgusting lettuce they threw in it. Attaching a picture. Also there was avocado skin in my salad..... it's frustrating getting something that is supposed to be fresh but then having to compost half due to its condition :("}
{"text":"Went there last night and had the meatloaf.it was very good. The service was good and the staff was very friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"Great food and service for the most part. I had the bacon wrapped ribeye and I'm sure there are a few people that would've accepted making this their last meal. Portion sizes were good as well. 

The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the support staff being not so friendly and a manager who had an even worse attitude. My main waitress was awesome but it would've been nice if other employees acted the same."}
{"text":"Harry's was a great spot for lunch. They have really fresh food options, friendly-service, and a pleasant atmosphere.

I enjoyed the crab-cake sandwich on brioche with sweet potato fries. The fries were perfectly light and crisp. The brioche was super-soft and the apple or pear (can't recall) slaw was a perfect addition to the sandwich. 

Priced at $13, it was at the top range for a sandwich or buger- most were $8-12 so pretty standard.

I have heard from other co-workers that it can get slow- so arrive early if you're eating lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and had the Grecian. I loved it. There's something special about their grilled Portabellas... I think they marinade them first. Only downside is I stood at the door quite a while before going to the bar to ask if I should seat myself. Not the most attentive place when it's slow I guess. But the server at the bar was very nice and informative. I'll be back for the grille Portabella sandwich soon"}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have eaten here with my family! I have been looking for an edgy eclectic place for brunch! This is it! Menu is small and delightful... Brunch beverages are EXCELLENT! Bartender Nikki... All I have to say is GO SEE HER! 
This isn't a drunken review by far... I'm just stressing how wonderful she is and how attentive she is. Amazing! This is place is a must have on your restaurant radar. 
Oh yeah.. The food.. Again.... So if I haven't raved enough about the venue... The same rave goes for the food too!"}
{"text":"This place was great, food and staff was wonderful. Had a few drinks and apps and was taken care of all night long. This is a place I would recommend over and over again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a date night or to get a different ambiance than the usual PSH here in Ayrsley. Service here has always been fantastic. They always recommend great apps to start and they always have daily drink specials! 

This is actually a bit more upscale than you think. I would put this more on the higher end of the double dollar sign. $$. I think it's worth it if you are craving a good steak. 

I haven't been able to pull away from any other appetizer other than the hummus & pimento cheese dip dip. The hummus is really good! 
Another great go-to if you are here to drink and munch are the flatbreads. They are actually more like little pizzas, not flat at all and very good! Very filling because they are doughy. Finally, when I am craving a great burger, this is my go-to. Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"I like the aesthetics of Harrys. It has a masculine feel and a nice business casual ambience. I was not impressed with the food. I felt that it lacked salt but I did think they had some interesting combinations. I had the creamy tomato soup and I loved the presentation of it. It had pesto sauce drizzled in an \"H\" and I thought that was not only a nice touch but also a nice added taste to the soup. What I did not like about the soup was that I found a piece of chicken marrow in the soup. My friend ordered the lobster mac and cheese and unfortunately she found a piece of lobster shell in her food. I had the southern sliders and they all needed some salt and friend had crab dip which also needed some salt due to its blandness. We had a great waiter named Brookes and I enjoyed talking to him and he provided great customer service. I did not have any drinks but there were some interesting concoctions on the menu I wouldn't have minded trying if I hadn't already had a few that night. However, I don't really think I will be back."}
{"text":"We had a no repeat rule on our business trip, but we liked Harry's so much we broke the rule.  First stop, we shared beer cheese soup which was fantastic, and pimento cheese.  We never had pimento cheese, and expected it to be warm.  It was chilled, but good.  They must  not stock a lot of Moscato because apparently I drank all they had.  We returned for another round a few nights later craving the fried brie.  We had just had the most amazing blackened brie at BlackFinn and thought this would be the same.  It was more like fried cheese donuts, good, but not amazing. They were still out of moscato, so that was disappointing.  We ordered a meal this time, surf and turf.  The steak was cooked perfectly rare, the crab cake was ok but had a lot of filler.  The steak did not melt in our mouth like Def Frisco's but for $24 it was still good.  We had a lot of fun at Harry's and would definitely go back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night for a friend's birthday celebration. They easily accommodated 16 people in their private area. Besides that, they do have space for sit down dining as well as a surprisingly adequate bar. It wasn't packed and I don't think it usually is due to its Ayrsley location (not much foot traffic and not easily seen from the main road).

I had the ~$16 burger which pales in comparison to the much pricier options of steak, etc. But for an 'expensive' burger it was well worth the ambience, service, portion size and taste. It is ground with various beef cuts and topped with bacon. Also comes with your choice of side. The veggie risotto was fine, nothing spectacular, but I wouldn't recommend the fried polenta, just bland.

Next time I'll have to try their main staples and adjust the review accordingly."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Harry's. Food is consistently great. Service is top notch. Love those Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place I liked it but I left it after when I ordered beer with my friend. The server was bad it looks like he doesn't like people with an accent. When he found out I'm Russian he started to behave rude. I was talking to him, he started to go somewhere and blah blah blah. He didn't want to listen to us."}
{"text":"Love this place. The drinks are strong, bartenders are friendly, and duck wings to die for. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome again!  Just had the bacon bison meatloaf with the julienned vegetables and sweet potato fries, you can't go wrong with that! delicious!  The wait staff is as usual wonderful very sweet very attentive."}
{"text":"A fun hangout. A little loud, but not so much you can't talk. I had the mozzarella flatbread and it was fabulous! Service was friendly and fast. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Great prices. Good food. Generous portions. Friendly Service. Mediocre atmosphere/ambiance. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Hoping for good food, but pleasantly surprised with excellent cuisine, and a nice dirty martini. Enjoyed the duck wings and crab cakes with Brussels sprouts & polenta"}
{"text":"Stopped while we were passing through Charlotte and hit heavy traffic. The food was fantastic and the drinks were good. We both had the bacon cheeseburger. The only downside is that the bartender weren't really attentive, which was kind of odd since we were sitting at the bar and I didn't think it seemed all that busy. Regardless though, I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Really nice place with great service and good food. Each night has a different \"happy hour\" which by NC law that cannot change the price of the drinks during the day so the drink prices are for \"all day\". Tuesday night is \"Martini Night\" so they are $8.00.
Salads are very good and I totally recommend the polenta cake as an add on. Prices are reasonable and food portions were good. Nice neighborhood place for local and traveler staying at a nearby Hilton Property."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  Great food, good drinks, great atmosphere.  The service is amazing.  A while back my steak was a little over cooked.  I didn't complain as it wasn't bad, but at the end when they asked how the steak was I told them.  I had eaten the steak and told them just for reference.  The manager came out in a few minutes later with a complimentary bottle of champaign. We were shocked, but they made a great impression.  We have been back many times since then.  Sometimes we just stop into the bar for a drink.  The bartender Jessie makes a mean Cosmo.  This is one of our favorite places when we can get out just the two of us."}
{"text":"I always make sure to stop in when I'm in Charlotte and enjoy a delicious bacon cheese burger  perfectly cooked. Spinach salad on the side makes for a complete amazing flavor surprise to my mouth!! They have other delicious food to offer too and great atmosphere that is very classy casual."}
{"text":"This isn't what you're expecting. This place embodies both characteristics of a dim comfortable tavern to enjoy a few drinks after work, and a high quality restaurant that is perfect for date night, entertaining clients, and taking mom to after church.

I don't know how they did it, but I could see myself coming here in sweats one day, and next weekend wearing heels and a pencil skirt. 

The food is FANTASTIC. The lemon salmon was on point. I also had their house cab because on Thursday its half off ($14)... I can kill the rest of the bottle in the movie theater across the street. Would could be more perfect?

For excellent service, ask for Jax."}
{"text":"Shrimp Cagun Pasta was very good.  Nice bar and the house pilsner hit the spot.   Others had the lamb and ribeye and all would return here again."}
{"text":"Was craving some duck wings and did a quick search. Saw that Harry's had them. Wasn't disppointed. The fried duck wings were very good. The duck is naturally fatty and very flavorful. You can get it with dipping sauce but it's good on its own. If you do get a sauce I'd recommend thr sweet habenero one. The flatbread was ok. The pita, hummus and dip was ok also. But thr duck... I'd highly recommend it  they also have a wide drink selection. The cocktails were pretty good. Nice and strong, they don't skimp.  The service was quick. It's a nice restaurant slightly on the pricey side but not terribly so."}
{"text":"Wow. Highly impressed with Harry's. The boy and myself stopped in for dinner this past Sunday night. Started with the cheese plate which is four cheeses selected by the chef for the day, meaning the plate could always change offering something new. The app came with sliced apples, bread, pear jam, grapes and walnuts to pair your cheeses with. All quite tasty! I ordered the steak flatbread which was actually sirloin cooked mid rare (upon my request) and topped with blue cheese crumbles and a vinegarette reduction. The flavors mixed absolutely perfectly and the flatbread was topped with plenty of steak, no skimping here. The boy ordered a burger, noted to be a blend of porterhouse and brisket - also a winner! Tasted amazing and we were both highly pleased. 

We topped off our night with two flights of beer - for $5 you pick 4 - 4 ounce samples. Works for me! The atmosphere was also highly noted! They have several lounge areas where red couches could fit in 6 to 9 people and have TVs around it, perfect for a girls' night out and a chill evening with friends. Harry's has one area more secluded - best for a date night or a dinner with family. And they also have an area separated by a half wall, closer to the bar, if you are looking for more of a lively, bar type night. 

Loved the set up, the ambiance and especially the food - hate that it took me this long to discover Harry's over in Ayrsley. Already have my eye on the pulled pork bourbon tacos and a cup of the beer cheese soup so we will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I have had to come back and update as I have come back several times since the first visit. For some reason the service has declined. Waiters don't seem to care. The food is not consistent either. I have gotten soup a few times and one day it's runny the next day it's thick. We have gotten take out a few times as well and just overall the food is average. Nothing special especially due to the price. The only thing I can say I enjoy each time is the pimento cheese plate. Unfortunately is not a go to place for us."}
{"text":"Great place! Andrew the bartender was great! Fried Brie was great with presecco! Had bison meatloaf ... Wonderfully flavorable!!!"}
{"text":"Good food.

Stuck up hostess, very unprofessional 

They had an hour wait and and half the tables were empty....."}
{"text":"Harry's is good food in a great location.  The service is top notch, the menu choices substantial and quality is excellent. The bar area is lively with quality top shelf drinks and interesting apps.  Dinner here is so good, you need your appetite and wine palate ready.  I have only had good experiences at Harry's. Need to go more often!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here many times and have enjoyed everything from the great beer selections to lunches, appetizers and Sunday brunch! The bloody marys (my kryptonite) are nice and spicy + only $5 on Sundays. I like the vibe here whether it's hanging out after work w/ friends or stopping in for a little day drinking on your day off. Whenever I'm in the Steele Creek area, I try to stop by this place."}
{"text":"Harry's is a fantastic hidden gem in Charlotte. Their food is great - I highly recommend the blue cheese burger. The salads are also great. Extensive drink menu and a lot of local beers. Jess and Nicki are an amazing bartending duo! They make an outstanding martini!!"}
{"text":"It's good for dinner and it's good for brunch. Always a good plate coming out of the kitchen here. Mid day today I munched on the amazing crab cake benedict. It's a savory meal and my eggs were perfectly poached and just melted in my mouth.

However, my server left much to be desired. Lucky for him, I don't believe in putting the names of staff members on a public forum for a one-time incident.

Don't let the staff keep you from the culinary goodness!! Also? Try the vanilla battered and salted sweet potato fries. Wowzers!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, clean with good food and an awesome attention. I was there on a sunday around 5pm. Bartender was super nice and very helpful. Food was good. Not extraordinary but very good. Good place for a date or a meeting."}
{"text":"Fat G. coming from Ayrsley. Having got off the plane in Charlotte and looking for a place to eat in town, we came across a place that looked nice and different and was actually open Sunday night.

Harry's is a combination bar/restaurant in the town of Ayrsley. Surrounding the area are trees, small office buildings and the highway, along with some local businesses and such. When you go in, there is someone to greet you. Directly in front of you is the bar along with some small seating on the left. On the right are some booths and tables for larger parties.

They have a small menu for food, but a larger menu for drinks and cocktails. I ended up ordering their burger of the day, which came with fries and one other side that I can't remember right now. The burger was big and satisfying and so were the fries, albeit a bit salty.

What surprised me was the cleanliness and the amount of service they gave us. The server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but in light of this review, I would consider it a positive aspect to mention.

I wish I were able to review other food spots in the area, but even considering this was our only place that we went to eat out, it was a good choice. The place is good for watching the game, or hanging out with people."}
{"text":"Food was great, manager was terrible. We came for happy hour and food with a group of managers from work as we had an out of town guest from California. There was 8 of us and we all squeezed into the one booth provided so we didn't have to split up. Most of us had not seen each other in months, and the guest of honor came from California and we wanted to show her a good time. He came up to us and told us he would prefer if we split up for dinner as all the food would not fit on the table. We told him we did not want to do this and we would play it by ear. He blamed us that our reservation was last minute and that it was hard to accommodate us. Once the food came, sure enough we were able to fit all our food comfortably on the one table in the booth. As we are all managers and work in the customer service field we were appalled at how he treated us. The food was good but he service was not. Will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy coming here for dinner or drinks.  It's nice that there's separate areas to accommodate either (we've used the couches in the lounge area by the bar many times).  It's nicely decorated inside without feeling fancy, but the atmosphere is much better than a beer sports bar (although they have sports on the bar TVs).  

The food is pretty good too.  The sweet potato fries have a sweeter baked flavor to them, not greasy.  I haven't branched out on my selections there but I bring a lot of out-of-town guests there who really like it and always find something to eat.  

Definitely worth coming to, especially on their 1/2 price bottle of wine night!"}
{"text":"The only thing that saved my meal was the company that I was with and the wine.
Crab cake appetizer was SWEET--like w/sugar--& not from the jicama slaw.  Parmesan risotto was neither flavored w/parm, nor a good risotto.  After a mgr pointed out my pushed away plate did someone come and ask about my food.  Ordered the Sirloin Dip slider app.  1 slider was one solid bite of gristle.
That was enough for me."}
{"text":"We used to come here often, but I think tonight will be our last visit. Their menu is very limited and all I ever end up ordering is a burger. Their burgers are okay, but outrageous at $15! Way too expensive for what we are getting."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite restaurants in the Steele Creek area.  Definitely a hidden gem. It seems like things come and go throughout the Ayrsley area so I am have been very happy that this one has stuck around for a few years.  I hope it stays around for a very long time!  My favorite thing happens to be on their lunch menu, which I hate because I never seem to make it there during lunch, but their dinner menu is just as great. If you ever get a chance to try the portabella sandwich it is amazing.   They also have a great selection of local and craft beer.  

And the customer service has always been amazing! I never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the black label burger with a side of grilled Brussels sprouts. Both were great. A pretty fair selection of micro brews and local brewery offerings and many other libations but I'm a beer guy. Dessert was chocolate peanut butter cake and it was fantastic. Staff was excellent. Nice mature crowd. Great atmosphere, not quiet but not terribly loud either. I watched food go by as I always do, and the scallops looked and smelled fantastic, and the steaks look EPIC. Next time I think a steak is in order.

Edited, Updated:
I went back and had the Duck Wings for an app. Fantastic. It comes with choice of sauce but the wings are so delicious They stand on their own. The Jicama slaw that comes with duck wings was very good, it has apple in it as well. One of the best creative slaws I've had. For my entree I had the Surf and Turf.  Pretty good crab cake and a really great tasting steak. 

Went back a third time, this time for lunch. Chicken salad sandwich was pretty good. The tomato soup was the BEST I've ever had, by far!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Bruce K.  I would give it 4-1/2 stars if allowed.  It was so good, that we went back the very next night.  The beer flight is great with pretty good selections.  Wait staff was very good.  The hostess gets 5 stars for \"creating\" a table for us and turning a 45 minute wait into a 5 minute wait.

The waitress on the 2nd night was missing in action from time to time and that's what bumped them down.  Steaks were great, winter vegetables and garden salad fantastic."}
{"text":"Upscale Tavern meets romantic sports bar if that is possible.  Found this place on yelp as I was traveling and wanted to check it out.  We were greeted by Melody who was laid back and friendly.  She allowed us to take our time to peruse the menu and offered some fantastic suggestions.  

They have plenty of interesting beer on tap and she recommended the \"Baby Maker\" IPA.  She then said to follow it up with \"The Problem Solver\" IPA which we both thought was humorous .  

We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese which was very rich, cheesy and delicious.  You could taste the different cheese in the pasta.  We also enjoyed the Brussel sprouts which were a little too oily for my liking and then the crab cake which was good.  

The ambiance here is nice, dark and relaxing.  The service was excellent.  Definitely would recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"WOW!  I placed a To Go order, but I was told to order their Adult Grilled Cheese sandwich.  I must admit it was not your little kiddie grilled cheese...no way!  First, it's on a French Loaf.  It has pimento cheese, bacon, and a tomato; all grilled to crispy perfection.  I choose to side mine with a side of sweet potato fries.  When I took the first bite I didn't come up for air until everything was gone.  I'm sitting here thinking that I should pick up two more for dinner tonight with me and the bf. I know he'll love this.  If you're in the area stop in and definitely try this Adult Grilled Cheese Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Complete coincidence that it's four years later nearly to the day that we're back to Harry's for a late lunch. My lovely wife was in a mood for a cheeseburger and I remembered the great burger that I'd had here. 

This time, I went with the club sandwich. Not the usual four cornered stack, instead served on a short sub roll but still with the usual cheese and ham and turkey plus lettuce and tomato and mayo. Quite good and improved with the sweet potato fries.

Service was excellent and the food was very good. It's still a challenge to find but they're in Ayrsley just past the YMCA. Street and parking deck available."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in at Harry's for lunch, it was the first time I had been there since it changed ownership. The place still looks the same, sort of a classic bar and medium sized bistro style dining area.

My wife has a grilled chicken sandwich while I had the crab cake sandwich. Overall the food was good. My crab cake was served on a brioche bun, topped with an apple cole slaw. The slaw was tangy and added a good bit of zest to the sandwich. The actual crab cake fell a little flat, it has a decent amount of crab but was dense and overworked. The sweet potato fries that came with it were pretty addictive, they had a sort of honey cinnamon crust on each fry.

It was a nice lunch, I plan to go back before a movie and check out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Last night I went to dinner with a friend at Harry's and remembered instantly why I live going there. Our waiter Kyle was friendly. My steak was perfect. The berry custard was amazing. The atmosphere is nice and quiet so you can really talk to your company and enjoy your meal. What a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Harry's. We ordered Caesar salad & tomato soup for starters & both were fantastic! For dinner we ordered Bacon wrapped Ribeye & surf n turf - both entrees were excellent. Only negative were the sides which were less than wonderful. Our server, Ashley, was the best server we have had in any restaurant; she was friendly & efficient!  Very nice dinner,highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Both times we've been here, service has been *excellent*, food average. This time one of our steaks was very overdone, but the other was perfect. The green beans were the best I've ever had, hands down. Menu reads more sophisticated than you'd expect (8), but the actual food produced ...  Overall, not bad, not great."}
{"text":"Really excellent excellent service. The hamburger was off the charts, as we're the flatbreads. Brussels sprouts were perfect' and reasonably priced wine list was a plus.

Will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"We sucked it up and drove the 15 mins south to grab some good bar food at Harry's in a foreign place called 'Ayrsley'.  Luckily they still use legal US tender down there, so we weren't too far out of our element.

The atmosphere of the place is pretty nice, and it comes across as a 'classy' bar, but the temperature was probably hovering in the range of 40-45 degrees...depending on the wind chill.

We fired some drinks right away and got the Harry Houdini and the Dirty Harry.  Both drinks were tasty, but seemed to be missing a key ingredient....alcohol.  The Dirty Harry was a quality mix of olive juice and olives, but a few sips in I could have really gone for some vodka.

For dinner, we ordered the pimento cheese, which was great.  The pita bread was warm and the jalapeño bacon jam was a nice complement.  We also ordered the Southern Sliders, which provides a decent sampling of 3 different burgers.  All were pretty good.  The beer cheese soup, on the other hand, was pretty tasteless and disappointing.

If I lived around there, I would probably head back to Harry's and grab some beer and maybe a burger, but it's not a place that was memorable or very impressive.  If you want to head there for a drink, make sure to bring a flask or order beer."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday evening when business was slow. Was quite impressed with a varried menu of both small and large plates. Food was very upscale but atmosphere was relaxed and laid back. Wait staff was helpful and attentive, yet not clingy."}
{"text":"WOW! Customer Service!! 

We were greeted and seated immediately, checked on consistently, drinks never hit 1/4th empty - this place is on it's game for lunchtime traffic!

The food was scrumptious too! A bit above casual - nice & classy.

Best tip about this place: the parking can be a little tricky, don't worry you're not lost!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner today! Appetizer scallops were good! Steak was very burned on the outside and taste blend! Brussels sprouts were burn as pictures shown! When I told the waiter he answered I don't think it's burned ! Wow ! Disappointed ! Will not recommend or return!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed everything I had here as well as the atmosphere. Good place to eat with friends or significant other and they have drink specials everyday of the week. My friend and I shared a few of the small plates, lobster Mac and cheese, the crab dip and the steak flatbread. All were fantastic. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the way there place looks inside. Plenty of seating. I went for lunch. I ordered the black label burger. 3 meats blended, brisket, short rib and can't remember there 3rd. I am a burger snob. I can say this burger was outstanding. I will go back and recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for a nice dinner. I had a beer flight. I'm trying to expand my beer knowledge, so this was a nice plus. I had a very good steak as well. Good atmosphere. You can bring your kids here also, but its a little more upscale than some of the local sports bars. So, its a little more expensive and your kids probably won't appreciate it. So, save this place as a dinner for two."}
{"text":"I decided to try something new for lunch.  I had heard good things about Harry's and decided to give it a try.

I always found the Ayrsley development to be poorly planned for retail space.  Parking is a bear here but at least there is a parking deck within a short walk of Harry's.  

I parked myself at the bar which was a bit awkward for seating.  My knees hit the intricate work on the front of the bar so it was a bit uncomfortable.  Also the chair to bar height ratio was a little off.

The lunch menu wasn't large but it had a good selection of small plates, sandwiches and salads.   I was also looking at the beer selection and it looks like they have all craft beers on tap with many of them local.  

For lunch, I ordered the fish tacos.  There were 3 of them which were quite messy.  They were decent but the fish was a little tough.

Service was ok.  It wasn't busy and there were 2 people somewhat working the bar.  But yet they only refilled my tea glass when i was ready to leave.

Still this place intrigues me as I looked over their dinner menu, I find myself wanting to return and give them another chance to impress me."}
{"text":"The salmon was cooked perfectly. Sat at the bar. The service was prompt and attentive. The homemade pimento cheese was delicious. Hope to be in Charlotte to visit Harry's again soon."}
{"text":"Located in Argosy Plaza, limited street parking, and has a parking deck nearby. There's a dining area and a bar area. Waiter Josh was very kind and attentive. He can also rap, so ask him about his mixtape.  

was excited to try the bacon wrapped Ribeye(cooked medium). Ordered a side of Brussels, whipped potatoes (waiter said it was creamy), and asparagus. Along with the  salad with Raspberry vine & Tavern Dip Sliders.  

For dessert: The seasonal which was a strawberry  shortcake layered over a  strawberry cheesecake. 

The verdict:  Ribeye was a bit dry. Torturous to finish it. Couldn't really taste the bacon wrap. 

Brussels WERE ON POINT! I could recommend these for all my friends and their mommas. I'll get them every time for every side. The perfect  balance of crunch and a surprise smack in the taste buds of flavordom. Mashed potatoes were not creamy but great presentation. The asparagus are very skinny, but hey ? they are asparagus and tasted fine. 

The sliders were AMAZING, I double dipped the au jus. Ahhh maaa zzinnnggg. Wish I got a second order instead of the steak. 

The dessert, looked great, but I was disappointed. The top half was an okay shortcake (airy, thick mousse ) but the cheesecake was sad. It didn't have much flavor, but the aftertaste was cheesecake. I didn't taste the cheesecake unless you chew it for a while. Never had cake like that before.

Note to self: order tavern Sliders, Brussels, Brussels, and try the tuxedo cake next time."}
{"text":"Me & James had to make a trip to Mt Holly and then Gastonia before catching out flight out of the CLT.
Ben & Dora suggested we meet up here for lunch since it's so close to the airport. Ben said he had met Jason B here at least a dozen times for lunch over the recent year or two as they wrapped their Realtor biz.

I have to admit I was  bit surprised at the style and vibe of the place. It has the feel of a swanky steak or chop house as you enter. 

We arrived just a shade after 11am for lunch and the place was near empty. We got a large table in the back to make room for the youngsters.

Kyle was on the ready with menus and water and we had the hummus appetizers with the pita points, wow what a great idea for several people to stare and a great healthy option.

I had the grilled salmon tacos which came with flour tortillas. What  a great meal it was, the salmon has pan seared and blackened and 3 tacos is more than enough for a meal.

James had the crab cakes, Ben had the Tavern Dip & Dora had the Club. Each entree came with a side and the sweet potato fries were very tasty.

We all liked our food and the service was great. By the time we left about an hour later the place was packed.

The do have an outside patio but there is no wait service there, you can take your beverage outside but no food."}
{"text":"Bbq duck wings are the best sause! The jalapeño and buffalo are not spicy at all.  Bbq is sweet!"}
{"text":"The only reason I heard about this restaurant was from an entry in the Charlotte Burger Blog. It sparked my interest and I made a mental note to try it out. I happened to be in the area and hungry, so it was a great day to give it a try. There were only a few people at the bar, mid afternoon time, but I loved the ambiance and the decor. 

I ordered their Black Label burger. I went back and forth on getting the Mac and cheese as a side, but I decided I'd just focus on the burger this trip. 

From the first bite, I knew I would be back. Very tasty, and cooked medium well as I requested. The pretzel bun was a great choice. I did not get to try dessert because I was completely full from the great burger. Maybe next time I'll have the space. Definitely going to return."}
