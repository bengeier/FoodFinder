{"text":"It is a small family restaurant and only 2 or 3staffs including the chef.   We ordered lobester bento box around $18.  their food wasn't impressive"}
{"text":"Sakura Sushi isn't the most crowded sushi place--in fact, I'd usually come here for lunch, and it would be all but empty, although there'd usually be a few people coming in to pick up take-out orders. As a result, the guys manning the place would spend much of the time watching TV by the counter, which was tuned either to Japanese programming or English-language kid's shows.

They have a good range of lunch specials here, from sushi bento boxes to teriyaki to a big bowl of udon soup, from about $6-$9. They're all pretty good, making this a reliable place for a quiet meal around Jane and Annette."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out regardless of the mixed reviews. It's a small restaurant run by a very friendly couple. The server was very attentive. I thought the sushi dishes were really good and the fish was fresh. We ordered the mountain roll and the double spicy salmon roll, which were both yummy. We also ordered the bulgogi and chicken teriyaki bento boxes, which came with salmon sushi and sashimi. The meat was good, but it wasn't hot anymore by the time it got to our table. I think the server had been waiting for us to finish our rolls before bringing the bento boxes, giving the meat time to get from hot to warm. Overall it was a great meal. I would definitely come back here for the sushi rolls. Not to mention, the food is priced well and might even be cheaper than your average sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hidden away at the back of the T&T plaza, Sakura is a very reasonably priced joint, serving good quality Japanese food at this price point. The owners are Korean, and I have received nothing but nice service from them even when we walk in 30 mins prior to closing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A decent AYCE if you are in the area. I've been here a few times for lunch and I've haven't had any really bad experiences yet.

The sushi was okay, except for the salmon, which were pretty good. The spicy tuna, crab, salmon rolls didn't have much distinction because there was some batter in them. The shrimp tempuras had way too much batter, but they weren't the worst I've had. The green dragon rolls and salmon sushi pizza were surprisingly good, the stand-out of my entire order. 

The service was really good, considering there were only 2 for an almost full house. I would definitely come back unless I was looking for more premium quality sushi."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this sushi restaurant after a friend recommended it. Found out the food was great (better than the average sushi restaurant). Nice cozy environment with friendly staff. The price was one or two bucks more than the average place but overall it was worth it!

Will come back"}
{"text":"Great value and tastes much better than any other All You Can Eat places in the area. Complimentary tea, salad, and soup was nice. Myself and the others were pleased with the sushi and service. I would not recommend the Salmon Sashimi. Small place, likely not good for large groups."}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE Japanese restaurant to go eat in Markham because of the high quality of food for low price that you pay for!

For dinner, I usually order Bento Box 1 (Sashami, Sushi & Tempura for only $11). Their raw fish, especially Salmon, is always fresh and fatty! And I love the way they make their tempura!

I also carve their udon noodle soup! Usually, I'm not a udon guy but this place has a special way of making it taste so good! Don't forget to add some chilli powder to the soup. =-)

It is a small restaurant owned by a family. I have been coming back here for 10 years so I felt like it was about time for me to share this gem in Markham with others!"}
{"text":"The 1 star is for the seaweed salad and for the spider roll which was half decent, however that's we're it stops.

1. Most of the servers do not speak English making it difficult to ask any questions if you wanted anything
2. When the food came out before we even started eating this guy told us \"you know you can't waste any food\" ... Which was clearly listed on the menu. Very rude!
3. Giving us ketchup on a few deep fried dishes
4. Fried rice is not Japanese style, more like Indian style mixed with English rice
4. Sashimi is poor quality
5. Tempura batter quality as describe by previous person
6. Tepanyaki skewers very dry and har
7. Lastly (not really just getting tired of writing) green tea ice cream had some fruity flavor.

Do not go, there is much better sushi in the city!"}
{"text":"Defintely my go-to sushi place in markham. Their 2/3/4 people set menus always leave us feeling super well fed and being able to eat a bit of everything (terriyaki, sushi, sashimi, handrolls). Love their handrolls tons of sashimi stuffed in...more than any other places I've tried! Great for dine in and take out!"}
{"text":"The sushi is a solid 9/10. But it is really cheap. 13.50 for all you can eat for lunch and 21.99 for dinner. Service is fast and staff is friendly. Favorite sushi restaurant by far. You cannot eat al-la-carte."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Always hot and fresh.  One of the reasons I am a repeat customer is that the Dinner Box specials are always a treat.  I really enjoy the lobster dinner box (comes with sashimi, sushi, rice, salad and miso soup).  Although it is not gourmet, it is pretty good for the price. A dinner box with the lobster tempura is $14.  If you wanted shrimp tempura it is only $10.  I have visited many times and also never got food poisoning.  

Service: Good service, not as attentive as some places but always kind.  My friend got two lobster tempura stuck together (he didn't see and bit into the hard part), they apologized profusely and offered to remake the tempura.  My friend said that it was okay and not to worry.  Later during dinner, they brought over two complementary hand rolls. 

Overall: I would say it is a cute little place to have dinner or lunch.  I kind of wished they opened later (close at 10 on Saturday).  I wished that other items on the menu had more variety or a better price.  I find the dinner boxes to be of best value for what you get to eat."}
{"text":"Good food at a good value. The lunch menu has some solid options. Definitely a great option if you feel like having sushi and are in the area"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch here. Good selection and very affordable pricing. The sushis and nigiris are made fresh upon every order. It's a buffet but the good is all made to order. Guaranteed freshness. It's my kids' new favorite place. They could improve on keeping the orders straight though. Some of the items we ordered didn't come to our table. Only got our waters refilled twice during the entire meal too. Could improve on that. However, the overall experience was great and we will be sure to go back there again. It's our new sushi place now."}
{"text":"I used to go to Sakura all the time when I went to high school close by and I have to say, I used to love it. It's perfect for a student budget and there's something nice about walking in, taking a seat, and having the staff bring your drinks to you because they already know what you want. Sometimes they'd forget to bring out something that we ordered, but there's no hassle in just letting them know. I've been to AYCE sushi restaurants before that bring back your order sheet and argue with you when you do this but Sakura is totally cool with it. They also don't ever kick you out if you've been there for 'too long' which is also awesome. I once sat there with friends for three hours (eating the whole time) and their service was good the whole time. Yes, there are better sushi places out there but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"13.50 for lunch and 21 for dinner. A huge menu of items that will please everyone in your party.  I went for the sushi and definitely won't look back. I've been back three times and the service is excellent. I highly recommend you to try it out."}
{"text":"I didn't have a lot of expectations. I chose this place because it was on our way and had 4 star rating.
It was a pleasant experience. The food was good and the service is personal and friendly. It seems to be a family restaurant, and they treat you well.
I would come again if I'm in the area.
The pleasant surprise was the light colour of deep fried shrimp and spring rolls, it seems they change oil often, which for me is a big +"}
{"text":"Great food, service and value. Went there for lunch. Very fast and excellent service."}
{"text":"We ordered the AYCE. Nothing terrible, but nothing really good either. The crab in the spider roll came out a little tough. The rolls were pretty badly made, and the sashimi was sliced two times thinner than other places. They didn't skimp out though; we could order more and the fish was good quality, but it just seems a little kitschy to do that. The wasabi also tasted a little... off.

Other items (shrimp/veggie tempura, tonkatsu, gyoza) were decent. Overall, I wouldn't come here again. For the price there are better options -- but I live in Scarborough. If you live downtown and aren't a big fan of rolls, you could come to like this place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Service is always courteous and it appears to be a family run business. Whenever I'm craving sushi, this is my go to place. I always get the bento box specials cause they're cheap and filling and the food always comes with a typical Japanese salad and miso soup."}
{"text":"Very good lunch special, ordered udon special; tasty and worth the price. Will be back in the future if around the area."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi spot around so far, as the others have all started declining - hopefully this one doesn't!

Sakura is the Chandler/East Valley equivalent of Akita up in Scottsdale. Same menu, likely the same owners. Akita started really well, and then declined slightly - they seem to have upped the quality a little bit at Sakura and you can definitely tell. A lot of the special rolls have a decent amount of raw fish filling (as opposed to shrimp tempura, crab mix, etc.) - my favorite is probably the \"Out of Control\" roll, which has a mix of salmon, yellowtail, and tuna inside in fairly big and noticeable chunks. Their menu includes a lot of stuff, from the usuals like edamame, nigiri, and rolls, to the more unique things like teriyaki, udon/soba, fried rice, and even sashimi at dinner. The nigiri is not packed with a ton of rice like other places, and while the sashimi is cut pretty thinly into strips, you're at an AYCE place where you can just order more.

I've been really impressed with the fish quality here. The fish has always been served cold and never at room temperature, and the orders come out pretty quickly. We've come for lunch and dinner, and both times it's been the same. The dinner menu includes sashimi and also a couple more of the special rolls at a decent cost, especially when compared to the other places around."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is not bad, but you can't really beat the prices for all you can eat. 
The sushi and sashimi here are really good, and the seafood udon is very good as well. I would also recommend getting the eggplant teriyaki and the chicken or pork cutlet. 
The service is very good they are very nice when you walk in the manager there says hi and welcomes you. 
The inside is pretty big with a lot of tables so this is a good place if you want to bring a big group."}
{"text":"Came to this little sushi joint based on recent good reviews, boy was I disappointed. ....

Though the prices were cheap the food was among the worst sushi I've ever had, worse than supermarket sushi by far.

Once we ordered our food we couldn't stop hearing a microwave in the kitchen! Every time it beeped something else was thrown in to be heated it actually kept going until we left.

The seaweed was stale and tough you couldn't chew through it! My friend kept trying to eat her California roll only to spit out the half chewed bits of seaweed.

The tempura was hard and over fried, not light and fluffy like it should be. it was like eating a cracker or kettle cooked potato chip.  The shrimp was overcooked and dry. Additionally, the oil they used was rancid and old.

Worst of all the sashimi was spoiled and was most likely sitting in the fridge for more than a week.  The tuna was discolored and turning brown. The butter fish was absolutely sour and foul and in no way was edible.  If I didn't spit it out right away I'm sure it would've caused food poisoning.  

Would have been okay if the fish was fresh.  Prices are very reasonable and it's a family owned restaurant.  I hope they read this and hold themselves to a higher standard instead of serving past-due food for patrons to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place. All you can eat sushi in the desert seems to good to be true. But the sushi is on point and there are tons of other selections, like teriyaki or soba, if you want something different. Would go more, but it's so good that I eat too much every time."}
{"text":"This is my favourite cheap sushi place.
My family orders from here quite frequently, and becoming frequent customers, the owners often give us a few extra orders of tempura or Jap Chae. It is a small mom-and-pop Japanese/Korean restaurant tucked away in the same plaza as Ajisen Ramen, T&T, and Shoppers Drug Mart. We often get the sushi party tray, an extra order of spicy salmon rolls, and some of their set dinner meals (bibimbap, teriyaki, bulgogi). We've tried most of their food and have not been disappointed yet. It is very reasonably priced for sushi (around $45 for a sushi tray to feed three people). Though it is not the most amazing sushi I've ever had, it definitely satisfies any sushi craving you'd have and a great bank for your buck.
Small note: they are closed on Mondays! I've driven there a few times and was disappointed to find they were closed.
Try it out!"}
{"text":"My Hawaiian wife and I have lived in Ahwatukee for nearly 30 years, usually counting on the \"standard so-so others\" for sushi. Sakura Sushi had opened just prior to the holidays, so we ventured in for lunch. We had read the reviews, and we agree with our predecessors ... they got it right. Clean attractive environment, great sushi, excellent service, and follow-up attention from the host to make sure everything was okay! All you care to eat pricing was a terrific value. As one other reviewer suggested \"If they're able to maintain their high standards\", the concern in giving 5 stars is that it's going to be harder in the future to get seated. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"This was my first AYCE sushi experience. I went in a couple weeks ago while passing through Phoenix. I was largely unimpressed. All of the rolls were bland, despite ordering from the specialty rolls, with a lot of rice and little flavor, despite the use of various sauces. When my friend ordered sashimi the first time, it came out in a balled up lump of wispy thin sliced meat. The applied that same super thin slice philosophy to their rolls too.

They charged extra for the iced green tea, including refills, even though after tasting it, hot tea would've been preferred. Their ice cream was sub par. My friend ordered the green tea ice cream and I took a taste. It was basically run of the mill ice cream, with artificial color and flavor that only vaguely resembled green tea. My mom owns a Japanese restaurant, so I've had the quality ice cream."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Service is excellent and sushi always taste fresh.  Lunch is worth every $"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi, unlike many all-you-can-eat places in the valley. Once you place your order, the food gets to your table in less than 5 minutes! We came right when they open so that might be the reason for the quick food. The restaurant started filling up as we leave Sakura. The three star is for the waitress yelling at us for forgetting to sign the credit card receipt like we didn't leave any tip, even though we left a cash tip underneath the receipt. Very rude. Got the entire restaurant staring at us. Definitely lost a customer."}
{"text":"As mentioned by others, small mom/pop restaurant with parking being a disaster in that plaza.

I've been there a few times with coworkers, however the most recent visit with the wife was not as good as the previous ones. 

I had the pork bone soup which was very tasty. She had the bento box which she enjoyed. 
The bad part was was the green dragon roll that we ordered. The avocado was off/a little bit more mushy/brown than we would have liked. Definitely could have been a bit less ripe."}
{"text":"Yoooooooooooooo, they don't jip out on the unagi like matsuda on middlefield and steeles does or that sad ajisai sushi on yonge & bloor.... *clapping hands emoji*
you fuggin deserve a 7 star just for that.... like actually, actually..... really appreciate that.
although it's small and looks pretty dim and run-down lol, don't let that put you off - the service is great and very friendly, they never forget shit, and the food is just on point. it ain't that hard to please customers with this place. truuuuuust

coming back forever and ever amen *praying hands emoji* lololllllll"}
{"text":"So.. I decided to come here based on the yelp reviews and the rating

Personally I find the place is a little sketchy, at first when i went in i had second thoughts.. I walked out of the restaurant  and decided to come back since I couldn't decide where else to go. 

Service Is pretty good, But the floor probably could use some work, and also the tables were a bit sticky.

As for the food, I ordered the special bento box (i think that's what it was called) It was $10 for the sashimi&bulgolgi box. 
 I would think sashmi is cold... but... mine was warm and hot... Maybe not fresh? or maybe because the weather was hot.. But still! It should be cold!
Also the rice was too soft......

But I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"all you can eat\" deter you.  The food is great and the prices are very reasonable.  The drinks are cheap and the service is very good.  I hope they're around for a long time!"}
{"text":"My go to place!!! So much so after 3yrs + hiatus (cause I moved away) they still recognize me!! Reasonable priced and very fresh each time I go!! I call this hidden gem :) We ordered number 6. Lunch special, tempera appetizer, and chirashi don... My complain: toooo satisfying!!!"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover!

The outside and inside of Sakura Sushi looks fairly dilapidated and in much need of a makeover.  However, the quality of food and price more than make up for it!

A tasty $11 shrimp tempura dinner bento box was amazing!  And definitely rivals (and beats) most other Japanese restaurants that charge twice as much.  This comes with miso soup, salad, sushi, shrimp tempura, and rice.  All of which were fresh and delicious.

The spicy salmon rolls were some of the best I've ever had!  They put on small fried noodles (?) that give the roll a nice little crunch.  The spice gave it a nice little kick and the salmon really stood out.

For dessert I got deep fried bananas, which were pretty good and a nice end to the meal.

My sister got seafood udon and upon stealing a spoonful I can tell you that I was very surprised with how good it was.  The soup base reminded me of some of the udon I got when I was in Japan, so I'll have to get it next time!  There was also quite a bit of seafood for the paltry $8.50 that it cost.

Overall, the food was delicious and the prices were almost too low.  Sakura Sushi has won me over, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A local hidden gem

It's in the warden and steeles T&T plaza....but it's in the row of shops near where wendy's was (replaced by green grotto 2.0) 

I discovered this gem one time while trying to get to new AYCE in the same plaza (thank goodness I went here and not in the new place because it really sucks) I only tried sushi and Bologagi, but so far everything was pretty good. What really hit the spot were the rolls though, they were so fresh! Made on the spot so often the rice and tempura is still warm (as it should be) and the sashimi aspect is still just a bit below room temperature (also as it should)."}
{"text":"I think bold c. might have gotten food poisining from some other place as I have been eating here for years, very often having the sashimi dinner or lunch, and have never had any problems. Their tempura is the best I've ever had, and the prices are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I read that the place was small, but it still felt smaller than I imagined upon arrival. They have good lunch sets and are willing to accommodate substitutions. Giving it an average rating though because I think the sushi is better at Gal's sushi and it's around the same price."}
{"text":"Best pork bone soup I've had so far. So good I came back the same week because I craved it. :)"}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of All You Can Eat challenge and this met my ravenous appetite. I came out winning and scoring the best dinner meal for my post workout. 

Situated next to one of the few Ahwatukee bars, you might end up parking far, probably the Safeway parking lot. You'll thank yourself for doing so after the food you devour. 

Dinner was an affordable price of $21.99 and all you can eat off the menu. I naturally went nuts over the appetizers, sushi selection and dessert choices. I didn't have enough room for the odon noddles dishes or the stir fry. If you buy beer, you get one free and that's pretty good at $8. It's the large size and love that they carry Asahi. Appetizers are sized for sampling but you can order a lot more as I did. The gyozas were nice and crunchy just like the assorted tempura. Loved the butternut squash and eggplant. The fried spicy tuna roll will not disappoint. Seaweed salad was as expected. The sushi selection is incredible and so generous. I had several sashimi and both the Sexy Roll and Fire Dragon Roll. To finish my feat, I had the green tea ice cream and fried bananas, a honey one and chocolate drizzled one. 

 Staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. Come here if you don't skip dessert or food for that matter. Definitely a perfect post workout reward for you and your wallet."}
{"text":"We were bummed to learn Kobe in Tempe stopped offering their all you can eat but I remembered seeing a post about Sakura. Checked yelp and reviews looked great. 
We were not disappointed. Everything is made to order but was delivered quickly. Portions are great as many are one piece or two so we got to try several appetizers and salads. Then we got the specialty roles and sashimi. Everything was cooked well and the fish was fresh and tasty. The menu is huge and all included in the price. We,love be back for sure to try more of the offerings."}
{"text":"This review is being done on the second day this restaurant is open. I rate every restaurant on several key points, my ratings are as follows:

**Atmosphere: 8 out of 10. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. Very open feeling yet each booth feels appropriately private. Beautiful murals on the walls. Just plain comfortable. You can see televisions from any seat. The sushi bar also looks very comfortable, with sports on the TV behind it. Not too loud, moderate noise with nice music always playing.

**Staff: 9 out of 10. There is an abundance of staff here. Everyone is extremely friendly and caretaking. Service was very good. We never wanted for anything.

**Food: 8 out of 10. Excellent selection, shocking how many appetizers, specials, desserts, sashimi choices, soups and salads, wok items, soups and other items are offered, and all are \"all you care to eat.\" We found the quality to be very good on all items. The raw fish items were extremely fresh. Everything tasted good and appropriate. It certainly didn't feel like an all-you-can-eat place, certainly not like a buffet, which this place is not, everything here is made to order and served beautifully by your server, directly to your table.

**Value: 9 out of 10. we've been going to the same sushi place for many years. We loved the quality, quantity and the service. But, in order to stay under $50, the selections were limited. That's not the case here. It's one price here, for absolutely anything and everything on the menu, excluding alcoholic drinks. This means that for an extremely reasonable price, you can select from well over 150 different items without any limit, they are happy to keep bringing whatever you'd like. Portion sizes are excellent, they are not small just because it's \"all you care to eat.\" They are full-size, high-quality and very good.

** Overall: It's difficult for me to give a full five star rating to any restaurant after dining at Kai. But, that's not this restaurants fault and based on our experience here tonight, I think many people would give Sakura five stars. The service was outstanding, the food is very, very good, the selection is amazing, and the overall value is excellent.

I would absolutely recommend trying this place, it may become your new favorite!

We will be back."}
{"text":"Its more of a 3.5 star rating, really. The place is very cramped. When we walked in, none of the tables were cleared. They still all had dirty dishes on them, which was sort of offputting. I think they were understaffed. The server quickly cleaned up a table for us which was good. 

We ordered 3 bentos, tempura chicken teriyaki and two tempura sashimi. The price was quite good compared to other sushi joints: 9.95 The wait for the food was sort of long but it was worth it! The tempura was really crispy and the sashimi tasted fine. It's a good, cozy place to enjoy some sushi in a quiet environment."}
{"text":"Had takeout the other day from Sakura Sushi! My mom decided to get me and my sister Japanese food the other day, and it was so good! They also provided chopsticks, spoons and soya sauce with the takeout.

I believe this was the Chicken Teriyaki lunch special for $10, without tax. This Chicken teriyaki lunch bento came with rice and salad, along with sashimi pieces with sushi in the other box, and miso soup!

Sushi box came with fresh salmon, white fish, surf clams, and with salmon and white fish nigiri. I don't really like white fish as much, so I gave them to my sister as she enjoys it more.

I really loved this entire combo. The teriyaki sauce wasn't too sweet and sticky (compared to many others I've tried before)... and because the sauce is usually drizzled all over the chicken, the difference between the sweet/savoury/thick/gooey is really important. The chicken is soft and chewy, which is a really nice combination balance of the sauce and chicken.

Now, I know the salad wasn't appealing to me in the beginning. But it was actually so good! & Honestly, it's all about the dressing. The dressing was light and kept making me want to eat the salad because of the overall harmony.

I enjoyed this meal a lot! A simple, typical Japanese dish served in Toronto, it was good because of the balance with the sauce and the chicken - It really makes a difference for my taste buds as I don't like the sauce to overpower the chicken."}
{"text":"If you want to stuff your gullet with bad to mediocre sushi for a decent price then this is the place to go.  Want quantity over quality?  Perfect!  Stuff your fat belly and roll yourself to the car.

The quality has declined from other reviews.  Presentation was not like the pictures and none of the food was good.  The  fish was room temperature.  The tempura items tasted like fair food (old grease.)  

We got quite a few items hoping that some were better than others, they weren't.  I watched to make sure the server immediately brought the sushi out to us because the fish wasn't cool enough to be the right temperature in the case.  She was quick which means the fish isn't properly stored.  The tempura was brought out in a plastic basket with paper underneath and the paper was drenched in grease.  We covered the menu trying items from each section, nothing.  By the time dessert rolled around I was completely disgusted and wouldn't try the ice cream.  My partner said it was the only good part of the meal.  

The drinks were buy 1 get 1 and the large saki's are definitely a large for under $8.  For that price, I would only come back in this place again to drink and not eat.  Good luck if you try this place!  And make sure to get a couple sakis in before you eat.  It might make the food taste better."}
{"text":"This place is not fancy but food is good value for money. I usually order the individual dishes and chow down. I've tried the bento boxes before and they do a good job for lunch. Seating is tight so be warned about trying to get in on weekends."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees! Great service, great food, and the price is fantastic :)"}
{"text":"Wow service is super fast and the staff is extremely nice! There is no pricing anywhere so it was sort of a guess on what we were doing since it was our first time here.  The restaurant is clean, artwork meticulously hand painted.  There was a cricket on the floor but it's hot outside and not like there were multiple or crawling all over. It was one bug no big deal. Now to the sushi. Well I'd say it was mediocre at best. I read other posts that the fish was warm or hot and really it's the sushi rice that is too hot and warms the fish quickly.  The slices are pretty thin and the rice on the nigiri just falls apart. Sign of too warm of rice.  The rolls are just okay. The spicy tuna isn't very spicy but it's the texture that threw us off. It was definitely pre made and almost a day old but couldn't confirm it.  Green dragon roll had very little if any eel and there were bones. Las Vegas roll had way too much breading and was dry. Shrimp tempura roll was average but wished they didn't use mayo in it. Sexy roll I'd order again it was tasty.  So if your looking for grocery store type sushi you'll find it here.  Green tea ice cream is good but tasted sort of like kulfi and the fried banana was too oily for our tastes. Not sure we'll be back... check showed up and it was 73.46 for 3 people for dinner.  There's another ayce nearby has a bit better quality fish."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that serves good sushi with probably the best prices around the area. Their lunch bento options are great and sashimi is always fresh. It's not a fancy place but definitely a cute, family owned small business."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and you just want something to eat, I think this place will do the trick. This is an ALL YOU CAN EAT. I went during lunch so for one person it was $15 which is not bad at all. I personally like sushi rolls so I really enjoyed those most. My favorite was the Angry Dragon Roll because I'm a shrimp tempura fan. I find it funny that the Sushi Nigiri only comes as 1 piece per order. But I only needed one piece anyway. I liked their seaweed salad too. The waitress was nice and I wouldn't mind coming back here if I just wanted cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Food is okay, sometimes the fish is really really badly cut. They do give you extra freebies in addition to the standard soup and salad so that's a plus. The lady server is also nice and prompt. 

The place is very small and quite run down, its good for lunch or a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"I just want to change my rating because I think they deserve 5 stars for their good food and hard work."}
{"text":"This place is really good for all you can eat. Everything is fresh, and it's all you can eat!! Servers are friendly and the host made sure I was comfortable and tended to. Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"I'm pretty particular about my sushi, but this place was a pleasant surprise. The spicy salmon roll with added crunch was delicious! And to top it off, the service staff was great! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend put it best, \"what is the catch\" at $13.50 for lunch this place is a phenomenal deal. The selection is extensive, the service is good and the quality is decent considering (good taste, but not gourmet, wont get you sick). 

Some neat little things, 
You can order tempura veggies by the piece , no long must you waste or eat a fried veggie you don't want!
Nigiri is also by the single piece, so just want a taste of tuna, or smell of roe you can do it.
They have some cooked items, fried rice, udon, cooked salmon, and a few other kid friendly options as part of the AYCE. 
Desert has a fried banana option. Need I say more.

Sure you can complain that the fish is not the finest quality, or the tempura may be a bit greasy, but be honest you found an all you can eat place since you want mass quantities not mindful eating."}
{"text":"Went ot this restaurant fro a saturday night, it is a small restaurant, that is not very busy. This restaurant was surprisngly in many ways, as it is tucked into a corner of the plaza, and kind of hard to notice. However the food there was not bad 

The Spicy Salmon Sushi Roll was a very decent offering, as contained a fair amount of salmon inside, and was well made. 

The Bento box was a mixed portion. the sashimi was certainly not bad, and the tempura was well made. However the Sushi the salmon sushi and the like, the one problem was the rice, and same with in the box, they had added too much water to the rice, and it was overly moist, and that was not very good for sushi. i think they had just finished a new batch of rice, and had made a mistake with the water. since the previously sushi roll the rice was pretty good. 

Overall the service is nice, as it is a small family restaurant, and the price was fair for a sushi place. This is definitely more of a casual restaurant for family and friends, and definitely not a date restaurant. i would recommen people aroudn the area to try it, as it is a fair al la carte sushi place."}
{"text":"First time here and we will Definitely be coming back! There were 15 of us and I have to say they handled our rowdy bunch just fine. Very impressed with the service; everyone was so nice and the All you can eat sushi!! Very good! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"So delicious!  The quality of the sushi rivals some we have eaten on actual coasts. We love the all you can eat menu. We feel like we get so much wonderful food for such a good price!"}
{"text":"Went here for their all you can eat lunch sushi.
Sushi was kind of dry, and didn't seem very fresh. But it was worth the price I paid for. We tried the nigiri, tempura items, fried tofu, and some of the meat skewers. It tasted like normal buffet food, nothing special. Even their ice cream tasted average.

Everything on the menu was average. Nothing stuck out except how cheap the meal was."}
{"text":"For a Tuesday lunch a day after Monday Holiday, everything was still consistent EXCEPT the Tempura batter.  The Shrimp Tempura was more of a Flour Batter making it more batter and doughy.  

The Shrimp Tempura that was made into a ROLL was lacking of any kind of batter and looked like someone attempted to batter the shrimp but the batter came OFF.

Maybe the REGULAR Cooks had their shifts on the 3-day Long Weekend and a TEMP filled in.  Unfortunately, I have to drop HALF a star for them at this point.  *2.5 Stars*"}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the better places in ahwatukee. My only complaint is that any of their deep fried dishes like the Vegas roll or the deep fried banana, it comes out super super dry and also like burnt or something. I'd definitely eat here again because their price is awesome and their fried rice is amazing, but it's not the greatest sushi with the greatest variety."}
{"text":"These guys are always on point! I've ordered take out from this \"all you can eat\" place about 5 times. They do not discriminate! Ask them for take out from their all
You can eat menu and they don't resist! Always fresh, fast and awesome! Great addition to Ahwatukee!!!!"}
{"text":"Going into an \"all you can eat sushi\" restaurant, one knows that they should lower expectations but still enjoy the food best possible.  The first time I went, they were open for a week and the pieces were fresh and surprisingly big for all you can eat. They did tend to \"forget\" the individual pieces twice (I count total number of rolls ordered as I'm that \"fat American\" haha). Once you brought it to their attention, they brought the pieces out. I've went a couple of more times and the rolls slowly started to get worse in quality and smell. The final straw was this past weekend when I went. As stated, I'm that \"far American\" and ordered 16 pieces of nigiri sushi (2 of 8 different types). The sushi came out and the tuna didn't look too fresh, the roe pieces had the rice to the top of the roll so truly the bare minimum was put on top and th straw that broke the camels back was the Saba (mackerel) had a bone in both pieces I ordered. Only found out after biting into the first one. Needless to say, this ruined the entire lunch and decided after this lunch, I'd never go back (which is sad b/c they are 2 minutes from my house and it was my 5th time there. I pointed the bone out to the waitress who didn't say anything but just took the pieces away...at least apologize for serving that. 
I always had the seaweed salad which is delicious (also from a bag you can buy at the local Chinese grocer but good nonetheless). I can't speak for all the other items on the menu as I'm a sushi eater through and through.
I've eaten at the nicest sushi restaurants in Japan and even tried a sushi buffet in Yuma, AZ and would NOT recommend doing that) so I like to think I can speak on expectations of a sushi buffet. 
Sadly, I won't be back. Main reason they get two stars instead of 1 is the service was always great with quick refills of the iced tea or water and the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Happy hour is worth it! $13 all you can+ buy one beer get one free! Done. Next time I'm in chandler, going there."}
{"text":"This is definitely an AYCE sushi joint... there's no doubt about that (referencing sushi quality). Sushi is so-so, mediocre at best. It looks good upon its delivery for sure.

RED FLAG: when you taste the sushi it should NOT be WARM................... every single one of our dishes that was prepared came out warm which if you know anything about the \"danger zone\" temperature of food- this is extremely dicey, especially for raw seafood.

AYCE was $14 so it makes sense. Restaurant was well kept in respect to cleanliness. This was my second time here. Servers are friendly and quick to deliver dishes."}
{"text":"I have always gone for AYCE and the selection is great! I also really like how they have recently started to serve rolls and sushi with brown rice (you have to request this though).

As with other AYCE places, tempura sushi is only available for dinner unfortunately. 

Service is usually pretty quick."}
{"text":"I am hesitant to write this review, not because this place is bad but because I'm worried word will spread too much and I won't be able to get in. 

This place is fantastic from friendly staff to quick service to great sushi. 

Came for dinner tonight with the girlfriend and another couple and was really impressed. The menu is huge for an all you can eat sushi place from apps to cooked food to sushi pretty much anything on a menu at a most sushi restaurants is available here and it's all AYCE. Note: there doesn't appear to be an a la carte menu for rolls. Looks like it's AYCE or bust with only drinks being extra. 

I was really impressed by how fresh the fish was. The salmon was melt in your mouth good and I think the yellowtail was more flavorful than most places. Nothing tasted old or had that weird fishy taste. The fact that the sashimi is available for so much stuff on AYCE is a major value and win here. 

Was also really impressed with the roll selection. We tried some different ones with the Sakura, NY and Out of Control being winners. Feisty Dragon was also good if you like crab. 

The staff was very friendly and the service was quick. Don't think we waited more than 5-10 minutes for anything to come out.  

Also of note is that my girlfriend doesn't like seaweed so when she ordered her rolls with soy paper not only did they get it right the first time (a near rarity) but they didn't charge extra for it. 

At one of the lower prices for AYCE in Phoenix and given the quality being on par with most non-AYCE places Sakura is a great find."}
{"text":"$13.50 all you can eat lunch? Sign me up! Sakura Sushi has a good selection of appetizers, sushi, entrees, and desserts. The fried calamari and shrimp tempura roll were unimpressive and a little bland. However, the Spicy California hand roll and green tea ice cream were delicious! The service was excellent (we didn't feel rushed to finish our food) and the restaurant itself has a nice setup that doesn't make you feel crowded. 

Will I come back for lunch another day? You bet!"}
{"text":"When I think of an all you can eat sushi place I generally think: dingy interior, less than fresh fish, and only a few basic rolls to choose from.
This place was the opposite of all that: beautifully painted interior and comfortable seating, fresh and delicious fish, and a variety of different rolls to choose from.
I expect this kind of service and high level sushi from a fancy sushi restaurant, not an all you can eat place!
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They are good but they serve too much salmon I wish I had more variety since we got a boat.

Food was fresh but I've had better. Price was ok not too expensive."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this plaza forever now and have not noticed this sushi place. It definitely gets overshadowed by yamamoto, which is huge, red and practically screaming \"come eat our sushi!!\" 

The place is tiny and dingy, but whatever right? It doesn't seem very busy but you know what, that's good for me. There are daily bento box specials, and let me tell you.. I've got a special place in my heart just for bento boxes. I hate AYCE sushi because I can never eat more than one round. Bento boxes are the perfect amount for me, in terms of sushi. I had salmon + california rolls + gyoza + edamame in mine and that was way filling. The sushi tasted fresh but some of the rice was overcooked, I think.. it was a bit too limp and soggy?? It wasn't a big deal, so it didn't bother me that much. Wes L. got the kalbi box and the kalbi was delicious. If I could digest meat better, I would definitely get that next time. It was mouthwatering, just staring at it.... damn. 

The prices are reasonable, and I don't see any reason why I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect of this small restaurant but came out satisfied. The food was great and the value was really fair, there's not many places you can get a $10 bento box for dinner. 

The first thing I noticed was just how small this place is, but we still managed to walk in and get seats on a Friday evening. The menu is great with many choices of bento boxes, rolls, and Korean items. 

Don't expect to be amazed but the food is good and is great for the price. We each ordered bento boxes - most come with some sashimi, sushi, and rice with a 'main item'. I got the tempura, while my friends ordered the bulgogi and chicken terikyaki. All were standard and good. Don't expect heaps of food in your bento but with the prices of these bentos compared to other places you can get something else to compliment it and the price would still be comparable to other restaurants. More choices, power to the customer right?! Like get some rolls..

We also ordered the spicy salmon crunch roll ($6) and the spider roll ($9). The spicy salmon was great and had a good amount of salmon but I expected more than six rolls though. The spider roll was huge and they even gave us extra spicy mayo. It was crunchy and satisfying. 

Overall a great place and I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"First time and will be the last time. Slow service when it wasn't busy, only 6 tables. Our food brought to wrong tables twice. We ordered spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy scallop sushi, we didn't know which is which and asked the server. He told us \"spicy something\". Server doesn't even know what they're serving? So sad. No scallop can be found in the spicy scallop but tempura flakes....octopus and red clams don't have it own taste but taste like frozen instead."}
{"text":"Didn't realize it was all you can eat when coming here for the first time. I was thinking the sushi wouldn't be as good because of this but it was actually delicious, especially for $21.99 a person!Will be back."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Wednesday night at 7.30pm. We were the only table when we arrived. Within the 1.5 hours we were there, there were 2 other tables that were filled. The place itself is very small fitting about 25 people inside, with pretty much no decor. Service was the regular asian style - not friendly but not horrible, the food arrived pretty quick which was good.

We got the $9.95 bento box which came with miso soup, salad, 3 pcs of salmon sashimi, 3 pcs of a white fish sashimi and 1 surf clam. Also came with 4 pcs of sushi and assorted tempura (2 pcs of shrimp, pumpkin, sweet potato and zucchini) and white rice. For all this food and the price it was a good deal.

The sashimi was good could have been a tiny bit fresher. The wasabi inside the sushi was also inconsistent, I had one pc that had a lot and was definitely nasal clearing. The tempura was good, felt crispy and fresh. We also split a spicy crispy salmon roll which was a bit disappointing the fish was really lost and felt a bit mushy."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place for lunch today and it was excellent! Nice environment with a beautiful mural on one wall. It's only 13.50 for all you can eat quality sushi. I expected the sushi to be under par because of the price but I was dead wrong. The sushi is delicious. Made with quality ingredients and wonderfully crafted! Well worth the price and more. The service is also wonderful! The waitress was attentive and very sweet. We will definitely be back here and I will be recommending it to every sushi lover here in AZ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! You get anything on the menu for $13. The sushi is fresh and the plates are yummy. The waitress Lisa was so so so great and the food came out so fast. Everything was more than we expected. Me and my fiancé just found our favorite spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Interestingly enough a true all you can eat buffet. Multiple courses lots of variety consistency with the plating. A very good date night or just to get down and eat night. Manager is very polite."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see the rating for this place has dropped.  I hope it drops more as a warning other yelpers. We came here a couple months ago when we saw a 4 star Yelp rating. Perhaps the quality has dropped substantially since whenever it first opened. 

I was surprised at how run down this small little place was.  It has limited seating. Yes, the prices are reasonable but the sushi quality was terrible. 

The salmon and other fish did not taste fresh.  My wife couldn't even finish her meal, which rarely happens as she and I both love to eat and don't like to waste food. 

The sushi chef was sleeping behind the sushi bar probably because things were winding down after the busier lunch hour. 

There are too many other good sushi lunch options then to waste your time here.  Move on!

Good:

- Cheap prices for bentos and other lunch options. Korean food options available.  

Bad:

- Sushi (fish) was not fresh. 
- Small restaurant with limited seating. 
- Looks old and run down"}
{"text":"Not much to say, wouldn't be fair. Came here with friends but my diet is very strict so I was unable to try any of their food as is. But my friends had a lunch special with fried chicken cutlets, shrimp and a bunch of stuff, huge portions great prices. It's a little cramped trying to move around in there but over all no complaints really"}
{"text":"ordered the spicy salmon roll & black dragon roll
rice was mushy & warm; fish was not fresh
totally fell apart when picked up w/ chopsticks

it wasn't like this in the past 
but i only saw the wife that day, not the old man (sushi chef)
so maybe it was her who prepared my dish 
either way, i wont be back"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I am a sushi fanatic. Wanted to try something new in the area. Worst decision ever. Let's just start with... our server didn't understand English which makes it extremely hard to communicate to a server. We ordered the spicy tuna rolls, and we got them warm!? We've worked in restaurants in our past, we know how the business runs. We didn't complain - instead we asked for our check and we paid full price. My advice is.... try a different sushi place!!!"}
{"text":"Quite surprised that this place was not only good but close to home.  Tucked away in a busy plaza on the Northwest corner of Steeles and Warden, Sakura is a small Japanese dive that's serving some pretty good sushi.  Thankfully we came here for lunch, so reservations wouldn't be needed, unless if it was dinner since this place is quite quaintly small.  
We were quickly greeted, seated, and within a few mins our server provided us some complimentary beansprouts.
For the works! we ordered three rolls:
Lobster Roll
Catepillar Roll
Red Dragon Roll. 
Overall all three rolls were an enjoyment. The presentation, and ingredient ratio (portion)was bang on, and most of all, it was pretty good!
The lady who was serving us was very polite and always asked once in a while if everything was good.  The overall interior is quite cozy, small, and warm with its choice of color scheme and decor.
Definitely a place I wouldn't mind coming back to, price, portions, proximity, and presenation was bang on!"}
{"text":"This may be the best AYCE sushi I've ever had!  For $13, it's a steal!  The sushi was really exceptional and the service was on point!"}
{"text":"Sakura sushi is a new all-you-can-eat sushi spot in the Tempe/Phoenix area. Their menu compared to other all-you-can-eat sushi spots is much better and simpler because they offer more of a variety of sushi than a very few select items. You can have any type of sushi from the cheap ones to the expensive ones all for the price of $22 during dinner time and this also includes dessert items. Their menu has 2 sides full of the different items you can get from appetizers to soups to sushi to dessert. The only items that are regular price at this establishment was soda and sake. For the price, it was worth it but some of the sushi wasn't as great as others. At the time I went, the  service was somewhat slow even though there were not that many customers but things did pick up after some time. In addition, the atmosphere was also another great thing about this place and their music choice was definitely A1. This restaurant had a lot of nice open space and they had a cool mural of their wall. 
Overall, I would not mind coming back to this spot."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 6 stars! 
I used to love Sushi Ken but was disappointed the last time I went to find it was under new ownership. 
The food at Sakura was delicious, beautiful and made to order so quickly! 
Definitley, my new favorite local sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"The place wasn't packed but the sushi was great. We ordered a bunch of sashimi, nigiri, and maki rolls. Everything was fresh and tasted great. The shrimp tempura could use a little work as I just didn't care for the panko bread crumbs. I prefer a traditional tempura batter. 
You can see from the pictures I posted that the color on all of the fish is bright and fresh. 
And the mural on the wall is awesome."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! Lowest of the low grade sushi!! Almost all fish was room temp. They even had warnings on there menus about raw fish making you sick. I have never seen such thing in my past 15 year of eating raw fish. If prepared and stocked correctly there shouldn't be any problems.  I never felt sick after eating I seriously had to throw up my food. I didn't ask for my money back because I ate my meal. FAIR WARNING TO ALL."}
{"text":"This is a great place for all you can eat sushi. Sashimi at dinner.....dang! Fish taste fresh. Im a very happy camper. You gotta try it"}
{"text":"This place was great. Not sure how you can give this much sushi for the lunch price they charged. Mine and my wife's all tasted fresh and tasted as good as any $80 lunch at various other sushi places. They not only have sushi but cooked entree's as well and all for the same price. No wandering around a table to pick up what you want, its cooked to order too which was a plus. And you can get apps and desserts as well all covered under the same price you paid for all you can eat."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want a decently priced lunch that doesn't taste too bad. The service is great and the food is decent. In terms of quality, the sashimi is really not that good and I would probably say AYCE sashimi is better than Sakura's. Regardless though, you can get a pretty good meal here for under $15 a person so that's not bad.

Verdict: It's okay.
 If you want to get a quick fix for your sushi cravings, I recommend just getting one of their dinner boxes as it's a pretty good valued item. Lots of options and you will definitely be full. 

That's all."}
{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! The waitress threw the food to us, she was so rough. Food was suck, it seem like they kept the fish for 1 month. I will never come back again"}
{"text":"Delicious, great prices, service and atmosphere :) if you like sushi it can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Who could pass up unlimited sushi. I definitely couldn't when I knew about this place. Only $14 at lunch for all you can eat is a steal for any sushi lover. Be prepared to stuff yourself"}
{"text":"The food was great however the customer service was seriously lacking. Waited 15 mins after we were seated before anyone came by the table. Seemed as if the tables were not assigned to a server. Other people had the same problem and were leaving unhappy."}
{"text":"A quiet and small Japanese restaurant tucked in the warden and steeles plaza. They had many lunch box options without sashimi for 8.95 and daily bentos with sashimi for 9.95 and up.All bentos come with a salad and miso soup. They also offer pork bone soup for 7.95. 

I ordered the lunch bento A - tempura (2pc shrimp, 1 pea, 2 yams, 1 pumpkin), 3 pc maki,  bulgogi. The tempura batter was delicious and very crispy. The bulgogi was very flavorful and not dry at all. I feel like there couldve been more makis but overall very satisfied and would come again."}
{"text":"Sakura Sushi is one of my cheap and affordable sushi joints in Markham! 

I usually order rolls at these restaurants as you can't go wrong with a red dragon roll (8.95$) - dynamite roll topped with salmon . I also ordered a golden dragon roll (8.95$) which is a dynamite roll topped with unagi and salmon. 

I'd recommend the golden one as it is the same price and you get both salmon and unagi! The restaurant is snug so it'll likely only fit a group of 6 max. Great for lunch too."}
{"text":"Went with my family to have some lunch on the weekend. We ended up getting the all you can eat of course. Kids ate free which was awesome as well :). 

We tried the nigiri assorted (salmon, yellow tail, mackerel, white tuna etc.) and they were all fresh and tasty. I also ordered the salmon skin hand rolls which were delicious! The best part was the rice incorporated normally in all you can eat places is normally HUGE, but Sakura Sushi was normal in size. 

We also tried the shrimp tempura (great fry), the chicken fried rice (pretty good), and some of the assorted udon.

Lastly, the dessert was included and unlimited. We had the green tea ice cream and the flambe banana (both of which were delicious).

All in all, I'll definitely be back given the affordable price and the good quality food."}
{"text":"Decor was very sleek and modern .   Service was fast.  Menu had great variety.  I love AYCE sushi that Includes appetizers, drinks and all menu items.  

Food was fantastic.   Enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place when me and my coworkers were craving sushi! Great food, great prices, and good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Me and my 12 y/o love this place.  We are officially regular s and are welcomed every time we walk in the door.  My son loves the sushi and I love the sashimi.  The price is always right, the service great and the food yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday.  Ordered Bento boxes. Wanted to get the kalbi, but they were out apparently. Settled for the bulgogi.

Note: when my girlfriend poured out the soy sauce, a little fruit fly actually fell out and into the dish as well. It was a little off-putting.

The food was okay... I didn't find the sushi particularly fresh. The picture on the menu suggested more fish variety. The bulgogi was a little salty. I didn't enjoy it that much, but the service was friendly and price is on the cheaper side. I don't think I'll return any time soon for dinner. Maybe for lunch seeing as most of the positive reviews for that."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch today, loved it! Had a few appetizers, sushi rolls, and nigiri. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"this place is exactly like Akita in Scottsdale, same menu same choices. Would recommend going for lunch at $13.50 per person. If you're a sashimi savage like me, dinner would be most worth it since they use better quality fish for their sashimi vs nigiri(lunch). The appetizers like shrimp tempura, crab wontons, gyoza are good since they're made to order, correction - fried to order. Their rolls are decent too, menu had plenty of basic and custom house rolls. Big plus was the included desserts of course. You're better off eating here than the revolving sushi places since you'll get fresh plates every time :) long story short, good lunch spot!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch to try our first sushi buffet. We love sushi and enjoy a great quality sushi often. Here are what i thought about this place. 
1. Quality of sushi : sashimi piece r cut thin and small. And the quality of the sushi is about average. 
2. Sushi rolls: plenty of choices and it was better than expected. 
3. Tempura : anything that came out fried were very tasty and crunch. We loved the shrimp tempura. 
4. Price : this is the best part of this place. U will be happy when u get out. 
Overall, I really liked this place since the dishes were served fast and the server did not mind going back and forth as we ordered little by little. The sushi quality is not the best but good enough. If u r sushi roll fan and big eater, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Try the tuna mango roll! I really feel like I got my money's worth with quality food. Staff was also very friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"We came because the 4-star rating. Very DISAPPOINTING!  Service was slow, sushi rice taste sad and looked like it was formed with a sushi machine. Sashimi was cut unevenly. Miso soup was fill with MSG...

Please beware with the false rating. This is a two stars place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Fresh fish, perfect portions, wonderful ambience and yummy dishes! Wonderful place for the lunch price. If I lived here my brothers and I would be here every week. Truly All you can eat off the whole menu, super fast service. The hot food was hot & crispy when it came out. Cold food came out cold. Love it!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi I've ever had in my life.

A few years ago this place was fine. A few months ago I got cooked food and a few pieces of sushi and it was fine. Mediocre but edible.

I got a red dragon roll (avocado/salmon). When it says shrimp tempura... it's a shrimp tempura base. Not a dynamite roll base. I could see the chef making the roll out of the corner of my eye and I feel like by the presentation I could already tell how it was going to be. It was just really clumsily made and it felt like they really didn't care. The pieces weren't even stuck together - in my photo we already started eating so that's not an accurate idea of it. I didn't think I was going to take a picture but felt like I needed to after I tasted it.

1. The portion was tiny. I'm 4'10. I really don't eat a lot but I was still hungry. So was my friend.
2. The salmon, same as last time, was not fresh. It didn't taste like anything and almost looked dry.
3. Worst shrimp tempura I've ever had. It wasn't that light flaky crispy breading/flakes you usually see on tempura. It looked like the fish and chips style of breading. It was so tough to chew - breading and shrimp (which was tiny and there was a lot of breading). Not fresh. At all. 
4. The avocado was overripe and tasted like it. So overripe that when I picked up the roll with chopsticks, it just totally sunk in. You can see in my photo that the avocado is near mush.

Put it all together and it was actually the worst. The unagi was okay though.

Is it possible for even the wasabi and ginger to not look fresh? The dab of wasabi was tiny and looked dry. The ginger on the other hand had a pool of water around it. Even the edamame that came with our meal didn't look like a fresh green, it looked like it'd been sitting there for a while and had a dull brown tinge to it. 

I feel bad - this is the harshest review I've ever written. But if I made this for myself at home, I wouldn't even eat it. It was really, really bad. Service was fine for an Asian place. Tables and placemats felt grimy. It's funny because they have a steady stream of people every time I come. Mostly middle-aged Chinese ladies who order the boxes with cooked things. That's probably what I should have done... but I'm not coming back so I'll never really know."}
{"text":"HOT YUM! 
New management is Great - the service is fast, prices are wonderful, menu options are nice! Don't fill up on the apps...but DO, everything is good from the salad to tempura to sushi to desert!"}
{"text":"Super tiny place and seats about 20 people. Run by Koreans. I love when Koreans do Japanese as this gives you more menu options. Lunch bento box meals came with salad and miso soup and also edamame beans.

Shrimp tempura bento $9.95 - comes with some sushi and sashimi with rice and also some veggie tempura. I thought the food was great and everything tasted fresh.

Kalbi bento $13.95 - comes with sushi, sashimi and rice. The kalbi that also comes with it was amazing. Good quality cuts of beef ribs. Marinated and grilled very well. 

Only one waitress but more than enough for such a small cozy restaurant. She always had a smile on her face. Service was excellent. Great value for all that you get."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre. There are probably only a few tables in the restaurant and the table we were at was sticky. 

Food is okay. Prices I'd say are cheaper than your average sushi place.

Service is pretty good.

Overall, I'm not sure I would go back. If you want cheap bentos, try this place."}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi, friendly staff, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I hate to be of the opposite opinion, but I find that this place does not meet my expectation of sushi. I liked the concept of a made to order all you can eat sushi and japanese cuisine, but this place is just not good. The staff just kind of did their job, not too friendly but not too cold. We often did not get water refilled right away but the food comes out pretty fast once you get started. 
My problem lies in the quality of the food. While it looks good and is well plated the taste of each roll is not fresh. The yellowtail sashimi had black veins and a fishy flavor. The rice did not have sushi rice flavor leaving the nigiri to be bland overall regardless of the fish's own taste. I tried the vegetable udon and again it was bland. The tempura was soggy and cold. Everything was not up to par.
 The portions for these are a little small because their AYCE style calls for smaller portions. While I have nothing against them, and their concept, I find that it is poorly executed due to the lack of authenticity. However if you have a nondiscerning palatte then this is a good deal at $21.95 per person you can get sashimi, rolls, fried rice, appetizers, and noodles."}
{"text":"excellent little restaurant. not much seating. food is awesome at s low price. seems family owned. relatively quiet untill the restaurant gets filled up. overall probably my new sushi go to place"}
{"text":"This place is the best food and value in town. Very friendly staff and extremely reasonable pricing for lunch/dinner menu. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The sushi is average to be honest I had the bento box which comes with California and sweet potato sushi and salmon teriyaki it is quite filling and also miso soup and salad I always love those items would I comeback here no this is a one time thing. The customer service is good which I greatly appreciate it and it was packed but the place is small"}
{"text":"We went to dinner here, and really liked it. Our waitress was a little disorganized, but I think they were understaffed that night. There were plenty of options on the menu, which did take a little while to come after we ordered but we weren't in a rush so we didn't mind. Sushi rolls were delicious, sashimi pieces were great, appetizers were great and dessert was yum. Overall, it was a positive experience for us, and for a little over $20 for a dinner buffet it was a steal! We would definitely go back if we were ever in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Sakura sushi is a bit hard to find in the plaza because the sign does not actually light up, but it's actually a quaint little restaurant that is nicely decorated. Our server was very nice to us and we were very happy with the bento box prices (~$10). The food was good and well worth the price. They were also open to making minor changes to the menu (ex. Assorted sushi could be changed for just one kind). Would come here again!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip Sakura Sushi. On my first trip I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food we got as well as the quality. However, take note. This establishment is an ALL YOU CAN EAT restaurant. No where on the menu does it say a order limit or that they charge for leftovers. On my first visit we over ordered a little not knowing what the expect portion-wise. However, on my second trip when we had some leftovers left after doing our best to eat as much as possible WE WERE CHARGED. This cost took our very affordable sushi lunch far more expensive then we had planned. Order as you eat which I assume is the best tactic however they never explain this."}
{"text":"Was given a recommendation to go here and ended up basically visiting when my girlfriend and I wanted something close by Warden & Steeles.  Queue, visit!

The recommendation I got here was basically to try the udon.  So I ended up ordering udon with tempura (I only like yam tempura so I told them to hold whatever else it came with).  I immediately loved when I was tasting.  This is easily the best udon I've had within Canada - the soup base was THAT good.  The tempura was just about as good - super crispy and cooked well.  I don't normally like tempura sauce (I usually just use soy sauce with tempura) but my girlfriend noticed it had something in it that made it unique - and in a good way.  This for the reasonable price of $10.

The place is very small - I think I counted 25-30 seats - so there's only one waitress who works really hard.  I came pretty late so I wouldn't be shocked to see this place being crowded.  So come early or late to avoid waiting.  The inside honestly doesn't look like much they won't win you over with atmosphere.  Because of the size, I wouldn't come here with much of a crowd.

They also have some Korean dishes - spicey pork bone soup is what my girlfriend got and she was pretty happy with it.  She also got some Korean noodles, which I shared with her.  They were pretty good, though nothing special.

I do plan to return here if I'm in the mood for udon - 100% recommended.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Mom brought me here. Great quality food at a good price. Awesome service!!  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly impressed with this place. I always feel a bit skeptical about \"all you can eat\" places and the quality of the food , but this restaurant was great! Friendly staff and fresh seafood . Quick service but with quality. I'm coming back many more times.

{"text":"We've been regular patrons of Sakura's since we moved into the neighborhood over 20 years ago.  We've always loved their sashimi.  My favorite is seared tuna and my wife likes the salmon.  Our kids have grown up on Sakura's and love the calamari."}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about this place & we thought we will try It out. 
It was AMAZING.
From start to finish it was the best. The staff were so friendly. The Manager/owner Allen was so nice. Inquired about the food & if my Mum had anything to eat. They were so kind.
Our server was Sherry, I think she said her name was, she was so friendly.
It is all you can eat Sushi & the food comes out in minutes.
The drinks are buy 1 get 1 free.
This place takes me back to my days in Tokyo. The look of the place, the smell & the food.
I wish them the very best & hope they have more business & stay on forever."}
{"text":"The Korean dishes that they offer a very authentic and extremely delicious... The Sushi prices for the bento boxes are very reasonable"}
{"text":"It's good for a quick bite. Service was ok. You may have difficulty finding this place, you can barely find or see the sign.

The menus were quite sticky and food is ok. They have a lot of bento/box specials and the rolls look really great (in pictures) 

We ordered 2 of the box specials, both $9.95. The bulgogi was okay, most of it was veggies.  The fish slices of the sushi and sashimi were way too thin and cut so unevenly for my liking."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!
So THRILLED to find this little Gem in the desert.  We just moved to Phoenix from Reno which is Famous for All You Can Eat (AYCE) Sushi.  

Wonderfully friendly staff and great atmosphere to go with it. 
Our party of four got there 30 minutes before closing, and even though it was a long day for the staff they were still very accommodating to us.  

Even though they are located 25 minutes South of Phoenix, it is well worth the drive.  I would even consider spending an hour riding the transit to get there... it was that much worth the trip!

My wife is born and raised Japanese and I lived in Japan for 17 years. Although not Japanese Sushi, it is very good Americanized version without a doubt.  My wife really enjoyed the Sushi and talking about Japanese food with the Chefs.  

If you are daring, ask the Chefs if they have any experimental dishes they've been wanting to test out, and volunteer yourself to be their crash test dummy.  We did and we really enjoyed a new Long roll they have been toying with.  

Don't miss this place !!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place, great quality Sushi and sides that are unmatched by any other sushi buffet."}
{"text":"We found Sakura on Yelp and thought we would take a chance! They had great reviews and I can see why! :) Service was amazing! Our waitress name was Lisa, she was very sweet and kind and seemed very genuine. 
The sushi was great, but the nigiri was AMAZING!!! We tend to lean toward salmon for our nigiri and it was delicious. It went down smooth and wasn't chewy like other places we have been too. The all you can eat is AWESOME for the price! They had soups, appetizers, sushi and dessert on the menu. :) 
We definitely gorged ourselves on the sushi and had ice cream at the very end. I'd recommend this place for anyone and everyone who loves fresh fish and sushi as much as I do! Great for family, friends and kids. :)"}
{"text":"I have to tell you, the other positive reviews are true!!! This is an all-you-can-eat without the annoying buffet atmosphere and seating. Just like any proper sushi restaurant, you are given menus to check what you wish to eat, and they bring it to you. This menu includes EVERYTHING!! Appetizers, soups, salads, udon, sushi nigiri, sashimi, rolls, hand rolls, and even desserts!!! I am quite enthusiastic about finding such a place. I plan on coming back many more times."}
{"text":"This may be an all you can eat sushi restaurant, but the quality is far above most all you can eat type places. The items are made to order so they're very fresh. The service was really good, our waiter made sure our drinks didn't stay empty. And to end the night, a small scoop of green tea ice cream was perfect!"}
{"text":"Such a great little spot for Japanese food at a more affordable price. Its really unfortunate that they have a hidden unit, but then again is it? You would think that its a dead joint but walk in and you will be surprised. Each time I have come here (4 times now) they have always been busy!

The menu here is huge. It was actually a little overwhelming for me to pick and choose an item, but because I was really longing for some bulgogi, thats what I got. There are roughly 20 different bento boxes to choose from. Most of them include sushi I believe, but they all include a salad and miso soup.

For a non-ayce Japanese restaurant, the prices of rolls are really below average at the sub $10.00 mark. This lower price, however, has no effect on the quality of the food. The fish is fresh and the rolls come out tasting good. The only negative part is the rice, which I feel is slightly overcooked. It leaves you with a texture that is more mushy. It wasn't all that unpleasant for myself, but for some who like their rice dry, this could be a problem. 

On busy nights, especially those with less staff, the waiter/waitress (owners) will have a little bit more difficulty in paying attention to everything you say. Along with cooking and serving people sitting in, they are also fulfilling orders for pick-up. Perhaps they would benefit from another pair of hands working? 

Anyways. Good Japanese food! Love the prices!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas, and was very impressed with this all you can eat sushi. We usually pay $35.99 in Texas, and they only charge $21.99 here for dinner! 

Very friendly staff, and good grade sushi."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here writing this review while still enjoying my Sakura Sushi food coma. Sakura was recommended to me by a co-worker, and I thought I would try it out since it is so close to my workplace. I was very pleasantly surprised!

This \"All-You-Care-to-Eat\" sushi place just opened last week, so I was nervous that they would have issues with food quality, serving speed, etc. However, they had none of these problems! The food was just as good as RA or other higher-end sushi places, and it was great that I could order as much Nigiri as I wanted to, without worrying about breaking the bank. I have also attached photos of my food when it arrived to the table. You can tell that they take pride in their presentation.

The way it worked when I was there:
  *The host sat us down at a booth
  *We looked through the lunch menu
  *We placed a large (first) order with the tiny pencils and paper
  *We indulged (received food in about 5-10 minutes)
  *We filled out another order with the tiny pencils and paper
  *We indulged (received food in about 5-10 minutes again)
  *We received our check (Base price of about $13.50 for lunch, but soda adds to total...My total was around $16, with \"add-ons\".)

The atmosphere was really cool as well. It wasn't too big of a building, or too small. The servers, hosts, and Itamae, were all extremely friendly!

Overall, I was very impressed. I will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Sakura is inside the T&T plaza tucked into one of the little units facing inwards to the parking lot.

There were enough tables to roughly seat 30 people ... squished & we were definitely squished. 

There were roughly 3 tables when my family walked in around 6:45.  We were seated and ordered a sushi boat to start as we were still debating on the menu.
We ordered the pork bone soup, the pork katsu, and the beef teriyaki.

The pork bone soup had a somewhat odd sour after-taste to it ]: didn't enjoy it so much.
The pork katsu was very, very, very dry so I distributed most of it to my fam LOL
The beef teriyaki was not bad. Yum. It was still a little rare and delicious.
The sushi boat arrived by one small plate and then another small plate and then the big boat.  I think the owner was getting worried we were waiting for too long and tried to serve at least some of the sushi as it was being made. This was nice. The price was amazing. It came out to less than $1 per piece but it was all of the lower quality pieces.

This place was a nice once give it a shot restaurant but I don't think I'll be back unless to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Never fail to impress. Service is always good, they're so friendly :) I love this place! Tonight we had:

Avalanche Roll - definitely a must try. It's soo good. Love the toppings on it. They always top it up with extra stuff! 

Crab Salad Roll - mmmm my favourite! Love it when they use extra mayo

Golden Roll - good but typical

Salmon Tempura Roll - a deep fried roll with salmon and I think a little bit of cream cheese? Not sure. But this is a comfort roll. Warm and chewy - delicious.


Price: All that for just $32 after tax. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Sakura a new AYCE spot to the East Valley. Walking in there are bright red designs a tribute to the land of the rising sun Japan! When you eat here you will feel some deja vu because the menu is almost an exact replica of Akita's. 

The hits: Lots of nigiri on the lunch menu with long slices of sashimi and the prices for AYCE is only $13.50. We had an interesting tobiko that was green! At first when I looked at it I thought it was jello but it tasted the same. 

The misses: We ordered the tempura and it came with sweet & sour sauce (Whhatt?!) not tempura sauce 

 -They didn't have Unagi nigiri and when we ordered the eel avocado they put the tiniest sliver of eel. 

-Ice Cream: Butter Pecan was too sweet and Green Tea Ice cream didn't have any taste. 

Verdict 3.5/5 
Take your friends for lunch because it's a good deal at $13.50 and you want to just fill up. But if you want the sushi boat experience this is not your ship."}
{"text":"Went to the door to ask how much their dinner was:

Me: \"Hello, how much is dinner?\"
Lady:  (rude voice) \"How many people?\"
Me: \"3 people\"
Lady: \"We can't serve you now, last call 9:30\"


It was 8:35pm"}
{"text":"**shudders**

I was in the third circle of hell a couple days ago. I was forced to come up to the middle of nowhere for sushi because my friend wanted me to meet her boyfriend. As I sat there suffering, I casted silent judgment on the guy who thought a sushi restaurant should:

1) serve sushi with ketchup or overly sweetened sauce,
2) have spring rolls (aka egg rolls in American English -- those Canadians!)
3) give you FAKE crab meat being sold as scallops
4) have mediocre sushi at best (even the rolls where you can dress up with various stuff were terribly bland)
5) makes up the worst stuff for uneducated North American taste buds, like Japanese hash browns (deep fried hash browns with creamed corn in the center)

And for all these reasons, that guy thought this was the best sushi restaurant in the world. I realized that I could never date anyone with bad taste in food. It's just pure torture. 

The service I had was great. The servers were really nice and I felt so bad for them having to give us this terrible stuff. I would be embarrassed. For the service I give them two stars."}
{"text":"I came here for the $13 all you can eat sushi lunch and was pleasantly surprised! The employees here are friendly, helpful, and attentive! This is truly a deal! Everything on the menu is included in this deal and tasty to boot!! Unlike places with all you can eat that make you wait forever for your food, anytime we reordered, food was in front of us in under 5 minutes. Did I mention everything anyone did here was with a smile? Even the chefs!! I will definitely be coming here with referrals! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants! I always come here when I'm in the area and I am a satisfied customer every time! Most of the time when I'm here, it's always packed! However, I'm willing to wait because it's worth it. It's a small restaurant with about 5 tables. 

I always order their bento boxes either with sashimi or bulgolgi beef. It comes with rice, 6pcs of California roll, vegetable and shrimp tempura, miso soup and salad. Their bento boxes are ranged from $8-10 which is great! They also offer a complimentary side dish; either JapChae or Edamame, depending on which day you go. Oh, did I forget to mention that they have Pork Bone soup for only $6.50?!

Service is great with an attentive and friendly staff. Affordable prices with a great portion of food. 

I have nothing but good things to say about this establishment. I definitely recommend this place so, go and check it out!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times with my family that I think we come here out of habit. It's a family run restaurant with seating for maybe 20 people max. Around dinner time it gets full, but there's usually a few seats at lunch. The food quality is slowly sliding here. On my most recent visit my bento box had room temperature chicken teriyaki but ice cold sashimi which didn't make for a pleasant combination."}
{"text":"Excellent sashimi, salmon and yellow tail, great service and wonderful atmosphere.  Awesome value too!  We didn't order any rolls, but they looked good too.  The only disappointment was they were out of green tea ice cream.   Great place and great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Our friends recommended this place to go for dinner. I was amazed. 
Interior design is modern and cozy.
Clean
Great deal on food. All you can eat is on all of the menu. The portions are small but you can order them many times. And it's actually better then a bigger portion because then you can watch your amount of food consumed and not overeat."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. They were courteous and kept our orders coming. 

The menu has a great selection of items for the price. Excellent choices of items through out.

The food was also very good and tasted fresh. 

We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Sakura Sushi is one of those places you will overlook.. you don't even know it exist unless you look really really hard.

It is hiding at the same plaza of T&T Supermarket behind Ajisen Ramen. You won't see it from either Warden or Steeles... I really feel sorry for this little place.. which is owned by a Korean couple.

They do have lunch specials everyday for $7.95 that includes salad and soup. I order the sushi combo. The sushi taste quite good. The fish quite fresh. The miso soup is hot and one of the few I enjoyed. 

There is complimentary appeitizer too.

The service is fast and friendly.

I will for sure going back to try out their dinner box specials which starts from $9.95.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had by far! If you're a sushi lover this place is for you! All you can eat sushi and much more?! Who can pass that up?! Very friendly staff. And good price for how much food you can get."}
{"text":"Came here last night and am pretty stoked about this place. It's clean, wall decor is pretty awesome and quality of the food definitely met the small expectations I had with all-you-can-eat establishments. With a menu that's half cooked plates and half sushi, this is bound to appease everyone's appetite. If you are here just to eat the sushi alone, definitely worth it!

You can pretty much order an unlimited amount and it's like not like they were trying to push our party out after a certain amount of time which was great. I am a sashimi lover and even though the quality isn't as great as a normal sushi restaurant - I thought that it was a small price to pay considering that they were pretty generous with how thick each slice was and it around $23 dollars with tax. A sashimi plate alone is already $14 bucks. My oompa loompa fat ass was definitely happy with that as I waddled to my car, stuffed to my heart's content.

I was curious to see if they were going to make the rice and veggie ratio higher to actual fish high to offset the all you can eat cost, but surprisingly all the hand/rolls actually came with less rice and normal sized fish pieces. The only thing is that you won't see some favorites on the menu like soft-shelled crab probably due to costs. Looking through all of their rolls, you'll see a reoccurring pattern where most consist of some combination of avocado, eel, crab stick, crab mix, shrimp tempura, salmon, and tuna to the point where you feel like one roll sounds awfully similar to another that you just read. I ordered some tempura, katsu, and my second favorite were the noodles which turned out to be pretty good as well. 

I would recommend you make the effort to come here for lunch rather than dinner. Portion sizes and pretty much everything on both menus are the same except for the sashimi option which is only available at night, but you can easily substitute that at lunch by ordering a bunch of nigiri. 

Service could have been a little better - but I just hope that the quality doesn't go down as that's usually what happens with these kinds of places after they've opened for a while. Try it out for yourself and bring some friends to join you in their ridiculously oversized booths!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for lunch, after I had received an ad in my mail. Lunch per person costs about $13. All items are indeed made to order, and items like Tempuras, come out piping hot. Enjoyed all items that we had tried out - fried rice (chicken and beef), chicken cutlet (excellent!),  chicken and Salmon Teriyaki (excellent!), as well as different types of Sushi. 

The way it works - each table has a number of slips that list all the items on the menu, and there are pencils at the table . Each customer can then mark which items they want, and the quantity. The server then takes these orders. The portion of each item is small,  but at this restaurant, I would not have it any other way.  The small quantity allows one to taste multiple items at a time, and minimizes any food waste. We did not have any left overs, and so there were no additional charges. One can also order the same item multiple times. 

Our drinks were quickly refilled, and service was fast! However, at the time of out visit (late lunch), there weren't that many customers. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the sushi as well, but honestly cannot remember which ones we had. 

I can say for sure that I will be back to Sakura Sushi. I had a wonderful experience with the food and the service there. I would also encourage others to try this restaurant, if you haven't already done so. 

Do try the fired bananas and the ice cream!

The only sad thing is that they have only one location. I wish they would expand to Chandler/Gilbert!"}
{"text":"My go to place for sushi when it comes to dinner (lunch maybe not so much IMO). Pretty well hidden in the plaza that it's in, it's got good service, it's cheap ($10), and you can get a dinner which has bulgogi and sushi, both of which are great at that price point. Add to the fact I live close to and my family have become regulars here."}
{"text":"So good! First time here we came for lunch, sushi was fresh and delicious! Lots of great options for sushi, appetizers, noodles, and rice. Definitely will be back.  Who can turn down all you can eat?!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Sakura and we loved it!  Restaurant is clean, staff is very attentive and friendly. Food is fresh and lunch all-you-can-eat only cost $13.50 per person."}
{"text":"Food is bomb!!! You should come & eat here because it's a small ma&pa kinda of joint and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I owe Jared for introducing me to my new favorite AYCE Sushi place. The hand rolls are on point and delivered with a smile. My sons are 50% off and free,  which I think is great, especially because my oldest eats salmon, tuna, squid, and salmon roe nigiri like most kids eat tater tots."}
{"text":"Doesn't quite compare to AYCE in San Jose, CA but I haven't found anything close so this wins my vote. I don't know why sushi in AZ is very cold. Aside from that, this place does AYCE sashimi. Not the largest selection here, but the ambiance is nice and service is friendly & quick!"}
{"text":"Fast and awesome... price is not bad... server is super nice... they have plenty of good sushi, udon noodle too."}
{"text":"All you can eat but order to preference, it's not your standard buffet line. You choose off a menu and they bring you the portion. Will charge for waisted food but I didn't waist anything, it was all tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome first experience at Sakura. Staff was all super friendly and great. Enjoyed all the food I ordered. Liked that you can order individual pieces so you can have room in your belly to try many different things. Found out I really like mackerel."}
{"text":"Small restaurant. Could probably fit about 20-30 people. 

I came here with a friend around dinnertime. It wasn't too busy, but there was only one lady serving all the tables. She was very friendly despite looking a bit frantic and continually dropped by to see if we needed anything. 

I think prices are very reasonable here. Both my friend and I ordered a bento box which came with additional items such as miso soup and salad (which has become pretty standard with these types of restaurants). Everything tasted fine; there was no fishiness to the sushi whatsoever. We also ordered gyoza which came crispier than I would have liked and were a little small, but not too bad. 

Generally speaking, our food was fresh and filling. The service was great. Prices are good. I see no reason to not come here again, so I'm going to give this place a very solid four stars."}
{"text":"Cannot understand how this restaurant got even a 3-star rating. We ordered a sushi boat, very basic. But it came back with dried and unfresh sushi and sashimi, overly salted soup... Nothing about this place is good quality. The couple running it were nice, that's pretty much the only good thing about it."}
{"text":"Ordered the chiraishi don. Didn't even bother looking at the menu. In my opinion if you are a sushi place and you don't serve chiraishi then you are not worth my while. JT Sushi is an example of one I wont bother. Only exception to that rule is Solo Sushi ya. 

Anyway got some salad, miso, edamame and seaweed for appetizers.  Standard gate for most Korean run sushi places but still good nonetheless.

The main dish arrived pretty quickly. Though we were the only ones in the restaurant.  

Taste and texture is pretty much standard fate. Nothing special, but nothing bad either. 

The price is very good too. Only $10 plus tax for the meal. Cheaper than others. 

This restaurant has now earned a place as my default Japanese restaurant as Ninja Sushi quality just went down and Sashimi House is far for me."}
{"text":"Super clean restaurant- great service- and fresh and tasty sushi and food! Definitely recommend!"}
