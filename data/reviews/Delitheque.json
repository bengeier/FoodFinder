{"text":"Great food, amazing atmosphere, very clean, family friendly, excellent prices and staff is wonderful! I highly recommend this restaurant. Been goo there for years for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Furthermore, they deliver and food is always on time and of best quality in the city."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I've heard good things about it but it was barely average. I liked that it has a varied breakfast menu there is an option for everyone. 

Breakfast starts with a cup of fruits which was appreciated. The waitress was good with refilling coffee which is nice but we felt rushed. The portion was quite good but the pancakes were bland. 

One disappointing fact was that one of my friends wanted a pancake with strawberries and was immediately told there were no more strawberries. About 4 min after getting our breakfast, we see a pancake plate being served at a different table that contained strawberries. 

There was nothing special and nothing especially bad. Unfortunately, that is not sufficient to make me come back."}
{"text":"Good place for a family dinner, they have lots of seating inside for groups and modern decor , their own parking lot , cheap prices, big portions and a menu with lots of choice for kids and picky eaters and they offer a salad  bar. Service was excellent , very friendly and quick and didn't miss a beat even though he restaurant was packed and we were one of many big groups. The food is not fine dining by any means but it's fresh and the portions are big. This isn't a place I would go for a date but good for a casual dinner or family dinner with kids or a large group."}
{"text":"This is exactly the place to go with family and friends when everyone wants to eat something different. Like all deli they serve italian, club sandwich, little bit of chinese, seafood and greek. The portion are really generous. I also go there for breakfast and it's really good. Big portion and good price."}
