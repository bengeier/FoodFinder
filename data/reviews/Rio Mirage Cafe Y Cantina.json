{"text":"The food and service aren't terrible, but like so many unfortunate restaurants this one suffers from being bland. I'm about as white as you can get, and I'm not into food that's so spicy you can't eat it, but at least throw in some spices to your food."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Tuesday evening, service and food was good, a little pricy but worth the stop.  Will stop back when wanting Mexican food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The chips were so-so but the salsa was very good. The house margarita was yummy. And the Burrito de Fajita was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Bartender was rude and ignored me completely. I left the bar once and he was really chatty with my wife. Never checked if we were OK. He made a point to talk to every other person but me. Even left my drink on his side on the bar too not giving it to me. Never will I go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Got super sick from the pollo fundido burrito.   Was throwing up all night long.    Gave me horrible food poisoning.    Won't ever be back and sad I wasted $40 in horrible Mexican food"}
{"text":"LOVE this place, BEST Mexican food in the Valley and the bonus is.... the entire staff are so accommodating, they make you feel like you are the only one in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious! You can get three sizes of margaritas (if that's your thing), sometimes for half off or for $1. My parents, boyfriend, and I went after a day out in the sun at the botanical gardens and shared a plate of nachos supreme along with a few beers. Yummy!! For $11 the nachos were more than enough for the four of us. I like how they put enchilada sauce on them. They were very accommodating putting the meat on the side and adding beans on top instead. Our waiter was really nice and made sure we had everything we needed. The front of the restaurant smelled a bit strong of cleaning products, but hey, at least I knew it was clean :) Oh, and if you want to sit on the patio, be ready to listen to the train that passes right by the place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chili Relleno combination platter. This combo also came with a taco and I went with the shredded beef taco. The platter was rounded out with the Rio Mirage Cafe's rice and beans. Ordered Guacamole as a side and shortly, was enjoying my meal at home.  I really like the relleno they create here at the Rio Mirage Cafe. The batter is just right. Not to thick and not too eggy. The shredded beef taco was delicious also but you can see I only came for the relleno.  The Cafe Mirage can be difficult for some to find, I am in this group, they are located on the corner of Grand and Santa Fe just NW of Primrose, where the railroad tracks cross Grand in El Mirage."}
{"text":"We should have known when the menu offered pumpkin flavored margaritas.  Very poor food quality...Not real guacamole, the carnitas were so dry, and the special margarita with mango purée had to be sent back.  When we were leaving at 8:30 they had already brought out the mop and started cleaning the floors. Not restaurant we would recommend."}
{"text":"Brunch food is cold, didn't get drinks refilled once. But the homemade tortillas are soooo good!!! As are the churros... Not having drink specials for brunch probably won't bei g me back to this place..."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, we stood at the host stand looking for someone to seat us since there was a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\". It took forever for someone to come to the front even though we could see into the kitchen and the staff was just standing back there chatting. After finally getting sat, our waitress came and had a bad attitude. She looked like she would rather be anywhere but there and she never smiled and was just unpleasant. I think her name Adriana or something like that? If you can't be somewhat friendly, and think customer service means being snappy, then you're in the wrong line of work."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times and every single time it is amazing!! The food is hot, fresh, and always tastes delicious!! The service is great too. Even if we come in close to closing they always have a smile on their face like they were waiting all day for us   We will keep coming back. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is the good location. Awesome food. Friendly & warm atmosphere. They have a mariachi band!!! made me smile. :-):-):-)"}
{"text":"Chimichangas were great! Loved the crispyness. The service was less than attentive however. And they wouldn't  let use the Yelp 1.99 coupon for a Margarita because  they said it was for a different  location."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Mexican restaurant in Surprise but the last three times we ate here it was awful. We kept going back hoping it was a fluke but unfortunately it wasn't. Shredded beef tacos were terrible. The meat was a weird mushy texture and no flavor at all. I doused them in salt to get some flavor. Beans were dry and over cooked. Chips tasted old and stale. The salsa is different from when we first started going there. I could go on and on but really it was terrible. Not getting my money anymore."}
{"text":"We ordered the buffet, the food was not very good and almost cold. The waiter we had did not say a word to us after taking our drink order, overall I'd say to avoid the buffet it, it was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Here from Fort Worth Tx, Rio was recommended by friends.  Was as good as they said, authentic Mexican atmosphere, freindly staff, great servece. The fajitas were great both steak and chicken, would go again."}
{"text":"This cafe is in my neighborhood of El Mirage. We Love it here....the food, Margaritas, especially the Coyote Margarita with jalapenos, the service and strolling Mariachi band, the decor and ambiance.  You are greeted like an old friend and valued as a customer.  The manager walks around and asks if you are happy.  If you want hot and spicy, ask for it otherwise, the food is generally on the mild side.  What is superb about this place is that locals, others and snowbirds flock here like an oasis in the desert. Also, patio dining is romantic if you choose outside.   It is always crowded, busy and great positive energy!  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Me and my Husband are new to town hes a very picky eater Lol we read other reviews and decided to try it. The food is amazing the drinks are Delicious and the over all look of the place was nice n authentic the service was outstanding great staff very nice people and a very clean environment. We will be back soon We loved it."}
{"text":"Arrived about an hour and half before closing on a Saturday night.  They had already put chairs up and mopping the floors.  Another group had come in about the same time as we did.  Seems like they were going to close early, however they decided to seat us.    The food was good no complaints as was the service.  Salsa and chips awesome.  If you area in the area it is worth the stop."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time after moving in down the street.  The first thing that struck me was that their tortillas are homemade amd extremely fresh.  I had some albondigas soup.  It was well seasoned but not overly salty like at some other restaurants.  Happy with what I was seeing so far I decided to order my favorite Mexican dish, Chile Relleno, to see how it stacked up against some other places I had tried it.  Once again I was pleasantly surprised.  It was cooked perfectly.  There was still some firmness to the pepper but it was very tender.  They did not overpower the dish with spices or sauces, so the flavor of the pepper shined through.  Not the most delicious Mexican food I've ever had, but up there.  The service was standard.  Staff was nice and food and drinks came out quickly.  The ambiance was warm and inviting.  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a solid Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is average. The prices are high compared to other mexican restaurants. But the staff is great. Always greeted with a smile, attentive, and caring. I keep going back cause it's not so bad. Although I think the chicken flautas could use more flavor. The Carne asada is good."}
{"text":"4 of us had dinner, everything ordered was bland and uninspired. The ambiance is nice but beyond that you won't find anything worth ordering again. Even the Cadillac Marguerita that was supposed to have Grand Marnier was totally bland. Oh, and one of us got severe food poisoning.  A 1 star rating is generous."}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to post this review because I'd hate to see this place get too popular.  It's perfect the way it is.  We ate here again last night - that makes three or four times for me and several more for others in my family.  It is outstanding and the prices are very reasonable.  I always order the fish tacos (delicious but messy) - other popular entrees in my family include the carne asada and el bombero (also beef).  The margaritas are also wonderful (and enormous).  Highly recommend this place, but sure hope it stays the way it is."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant on four separate occasions. We are three out of four. On this last visit the food was not very hot, so we returned our meal. The food returned hot, hot lettuce, hot tomatoes, pretty half ass."}
{"text":"Everything was fast and delivered precisely. The food and drink were very delicious!  Will return again soon!"}
{"text":"This is probably tied with another Mexican restaurant on Dysart and Thunderbird as my least favorite Mexican food joint. Maybe it was just me, but they didn't have a wide variety to choose from. Also, everything I asked the waiter about was \"hot.\" I realize it's a Mexican restaurant and that type of food is usually spicy, but give us spice fearing gringos some wiggle room! I was going to get a chimichanga but figured that if I was going to pay $13.95 for something I could easily get for $6 at one of the fast food Mexican joints I would just pay a buck more and get fajitas. I got the chicken fajitas and they were NOT good. It seriously tasted like how my garbage smells. It was gross. Plus, the pico was put onto the hot plate with the meat. Hot pico=not good. The salsa and chips were delicious though, as was the guacamole. Our server was very nice, but not very attentive at all. He took about 15 minutes to come back and take our order after getting us our drinks. Then he said he'd get us more chips. Yeah, never happened. I still tipped 20% because, like I said, he was very nice and seemed like he meant well. They just seemed over busy and understaffed. That's not the waiter's fault. Even though the chips and salsa were great, I will not be back. Ever. The price is way too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. We recently moved to the southwest and this was the quality of Mexican food we were excited to be able to get."}
{"text":"The food is great, shrimp cocktails have an authentic flavor. The shredded beef tacos are my favorite. Fresh tortillas are a must! Would have given more stars but the wait staff is inconsistent, the food is with it though."}
{"text":"Everything contributed to an all-around excellent experience. The building was surprisingly large but very welcoming, with wonderful pottery and murals. The staff were helpful and humorous. The salsa was relatively mild and quite chunky in the best sense of term. I ordered \"The Firefighter\", spicy steak in onions, chili sauce, etc., and it was flavorful, hearty, and delicious (yet not as spicy as I expected, though I am a native Arizonan who eats plenty of Mexican). Not to mention, if your meal comes with their fresh, thick flour tortillas, they can be refilled on request, and they even come in a colorful wicker basket. I would definitely return. I would also like to note that they were accommodating to a service dog, even though he didn't even have any bandana or identification."}
{"text":"Great drinks (get the strawberry margarita!)  and delicious food! The bathroom was disgusting though and the parking lot is kind of hard to get to... otherwise, it was a nice dinner spot! Our waitress/bartender was sweet, too!"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall. Took awhile to find it but it was worth it. Their silver margaritas were good, not too strong though. We had their rolled quesadillas with steak which were very tasty. Not fancy but good eats in a cozy environment."}
{"text":"Took my wife and a couple of friends there for the first time and all four of us loved our dish. It's got a nice setting, the service is great, and there was a mariachi playing for tips, which I thought was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. The food is amazing and the staff is always so pleasant.  ."}
{"text":"A local favorite around here. This was one of the first places we ate at when we moved into the neighborhood. The food is tasty with a very large selection of items. Their pricing seems to be in par with mainstream mexican food restaurants even though you would expect it to be cheaper as it appears to be more of a \"mom and pop\" kind of place.   They have a small cantina where you can come and sit down in and enjoy a very cheap but very tasty margarita. They even have $.99 margs on mondays.   We've come back multiple times and each time have had a pleasant experience each time. The best part, it's practically walking distance."}
{"text":"Great food and nice servers, but extremely slow! It is slow every time, but we come back for the food, it's great!"}
{"text":"I was able to visit this establishment on 3/29 after Spring Training in Camelback.   A friend of mine found this place based on the star rating on Yelp so we decided to give it a go. Upon arriving things looked like they were headed in the right direction, however, things changed once we sat down.   They were able to accommodate our large party of 8 which was nice, got in right before early dinner rush came in. Once we sat down, my girlfriend asked if we could get some water, the waitress responded \"Now?\", no we wanted water as were about to leave. The waitress did bring out one glass of water while everyone else waited. 15 mins later, a new waitress came out and finally brought water and took drink orders, after my friend had to flag her down and ask if we could order drinks. 15 mins later, the drinks finally came out, with a different waitress, even though there were was a surplus of workers. The Michelada was a bit watery, not enough tomato juice.   The service is a it slow, almost as if they are the tortoise in a race. The responses to questions felt like a forced, almost put off, response. Our drinks weren't cleared until the chip man came around and had to be asked, even then, he removed the chips and two glasses. The other glasses were left behind as if they were two week old enchiladas.   Once the food came out, that sort of brought it up to par. I shared the carne asada plate and it was pretty good, the flour tortillas were the highlight.   I'm not sure what the 75 4-star rating is about, there was nothing amazing about the place and probably wouldn't go back if I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Margaritas were refreshing and delicious! Beef Chimichanga and Chicken chimichanga were really delicious! Made note of the Sunday Buffet. We were there about the time it ended but looked like it might have been a good option earlier! The tamales are decent sized and they make maza like I do , with chili in the dough!!! How good was this place? Good enough that hubby asked me to book mark it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun. Service was spectacular. Fare was less than fair.   Yet another gringo-gone-bad Mexican restaurant. I've HAD good bad Mexican, if that makes sense, but I can't understand why Mexican restaurants must insult the potential of the American palate! Maybe most rural Americans DO expect and desire bland, fatty, cheesy, fried foods served in embarrassing gigantic portions, but given the chance, with truly traditional Mexican cuisine, they might cultivate a different taste profile and expectation. The subtlety needs to be explored.   As I said, I enjoyed the space (kitschy as it was), and the service was prompt Bd friendly, but too bad I had to try and eat there!   PROXIMO!"}
{"text":"Good food. Watered down drinks. Doesn't honor coupons. Under staffed. Food was only good experience about it.."}
{"text":"I always go to this location and I love it!  food is always good, atmosphere is great and staff is friendly.  It can be very loud on Friday nights because of the Mariachi band that plays but it adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really love the El Mirage location of Rio Mirage.  The food tastes great, the service is awesome, the atmosphere is nice, and the Monday margarita deals are phenomenal!  I will mention the Surprise location does not earn the same rating, but the El Mirage location is the best Mexican around!"}
{"text":"4 stars on yelp? Really? Service was very slow.  Booth seats uncomfortable. No Horchata or Agua frescas. We split the mahi mahi taco plate. Fish was very dry and I have a doubt that it was mahi mahi. Probably Talapia. No taste! The only bright spot was the chips and salsa. Needless to say, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"great food and great service.  I accidently came upon this while starving for lunch.  what a find. very nice, helpful and friendly staff.  lots of menu selection and very good food. just wish they had Chile Verde on the menu."}
{"text":"Been going here 10 years plus  We always have great food and service  2 locations Surprise and El Mirage  El Mirage is the best Old school Mexican and always spot on"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we ventured into this neighbourhood for a Mexican meal.   First a note on the neighbourhood. It is beside the tracks and away from the sanitized neighbourhoods of Sun City. Some individuals may not be comfortable and should consider a noon meal. For those more comfortable with world travel, this should be in the top of their list.   Walking in immediately brought me back to a Mexicaleri in Merida, Mexico. The bright colours, painted walls and multiple rooms are typical Mexican.   The staff match the decor and know their stuff in regards to making suggestions and attentively keep diners happy.   The food was amazing. All of the usual dishes are in the menu. The flavours are fabulous. The balance of chilli, cilantro and cumin was perfect.  This would be a regular for me if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"YUM!!! Haven't had good Mexican food like this in a while! This is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We dined at this restaurant during a $2 margarita night.  The service was slow and the food was mediocre.  I have a feeling that the huge crowd draw revolved around the cheap drinks. I did not find this to be anything special and quite honestly I would rather pay more for my drink and have better food. The atmosphere was a little shabby as well."}
{"text":"MY absolute favorite Mexican restaurant!  They have 2 locations... 1 at Litchfield and Bell, and this one in El Mirage off Grand Ave.  I like both, but LOVE the Grand Ave original location.  On Sundays they have the annoying mariachi man thou.  ;/  LOL"}
{"text":"Gross food. Not authentic Mexican food at all. I didn't like it one bit. To each her own though."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.  The first few times the food and service were fine.  This last time Thursday evening the food and service were awful.  The waiter  came to take our drink order.  He was not able or willing to answer any questions and was openly inpatient.  I got a giant margarita that was very good. The reason for the two stars.  We both ordered beef fajitas.  The meat was tough and tasteless.  We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm from NM and it's very hard to find good \"New\" Mexican food in AZ.  I'm not a fan of Tex Mex. I love sauces, hatch green chile and posole.   Rio Mirage is a great place to enjoy some good Mexican food in Surprise, AZ.    The atmosphere is phenomenal and the buffet offers just about everything you can imagine and some!   The service is outstanding and the food is great!!  You will get your monies worth by ordering a plate or enjoying the buffet.   I wouldn't recommend the Rio Mirage on Bell and Litchfield.   This location is 100 times better for some odd reason. The food, atmosphere and customer service just isn't the same on Litchfield."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for over 10 years now, never had a bad  meal yet, don't expect to either. .... we visit there about once a month or when company comes to town and we want to treat them to a good mexican meal...."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Since I moved to AZ. from TX. I have been searching for good Mexican food and I finally found it.  Our server, Eric, was the best.  Took time to answer our questions, always with a smile.  The salsa was great and so were the tacos.  We went on Monday and the Margaritas were only $0.99 and were better than most other places.  We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"Ok so there Prices have gone through the roof! We had 2 orders fajitas beef an chicken  2 sodas....That's all bill was $40.00 left $6.00 tip,service was good....Alot of onions not alot of meat ....plate didn't even sizzle when brought to table...Was not $40.00 dollar good...epically at lunch time"}
{"text":"If your a vegetarian there is only one dish on the menu. The . My wife asked about that dish and our waiter copped an attitude when asked about the #5(  Chile Relleno & Green (only) Tamale) and #6(Red or Green Chile Burro & Cheese Enchilada)  items on the menu. The #5 dish had no meat which constitutes a vegetarian dish.  I had the Slow Roasted Carnitas. The waiter asked me if I wanted flour or corn  tort i l l a s. I asked for corn and was never given them.  I have never experienced such a lack of customer service from a waiter in my dining at any restaurant. I wish I had his name so I could tell someone about our experience.  The food was good but I seriously doubt I would come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Every single time I have ordered to go, I have waiting at the desk for at least 15 minutes while staff try to figure out where my order is. Last time, I had to wait for the person that actually took the order to get my food and they couldn't find her. One would think the food would be back in the kitchen. The food here is good but the long wait for to go orders and the fact that they now limit their $1 margaritas on Monday to 2 is why it received the lower rating. The management tried explaining that they limit them to 2 for legal purposes but when questioned how many large margaritas I could order at full price, he said as many as I wanted. So, they are not so much concerned about drinking and driving (I've always taken an uber there), the bottom line is trying to lure customers in with the $1 margarita and then telling them they can only have 2 after they have sucked the second one down. I was recently there (again, I said the food was good) and received excellent service from a blonde headed waitress whose name I cannot remember. I've always gotten good service while seated but she gave exceptional service."}
{"text":"This place was FANTASTIC! Everyone's food was fantastic, but I like burritos and they have this burrito(El Rico) that is slightly fried so the tortilla is a little bit crispy, then you add in poblano peppers, steak, cheese, onions, and mushrooms, and you get the best burrito I have ever eaten! The service is excellent and the food comes out relatively quick so you dont have to wait forever to eat!  We were also blessed to go on a Friday night, where there is a mariachi band that will play right to the table! What a great experience and my mouth is still bursting with flavor from eating here."}
{"text":"Our server, Mike, made an excellent recommendation, and  I highly recommend 'Carne Machaca Dinner' which is served with their home made flour tortillas - outstanding!  We nearly licked the plate after finishing the flan; some of the best ever. Friendly service, welcoming atmosphere. Family-friendly too. We'll be back, and hope to take advantage of their happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here once, and the experience was great. This definitely is a hidden gem in El Mirage. We just moved to the area recently, so we will be going back to this restaurant soon. Hopefully our next trip is just as nice.  It is a bit noisy but nothing that bothers me. I have 2 kids so I prefer the noise. If you're looking for a quiet intimate dinner then this probably wouldn't be the place.  The service was a teeny bit slow but it was packed, so that's understandable. The food was worth it. I got the tacos Mexicanos and it was delicious. The tortillas are excellent, I could eat them plain! So yummy. The food is a bit greasy but I've never gone to this style of mexican restaurant without having greasy food. It kind of comes with the territory.  We will be coming back for happy hour soon. I'm so glad we found this place! I recommend that you at least try it out, as there's not much else to choose from if you live in El Mirage."}
{"text":"On our way to Sedona and used yelp to determine where to stop. Easy location off highway. Staff is super friendly. Authentic food. We ordered chicken Mexican pizza and it was great. Large. Their salsa is good, tad different but wonderful. Warm chips served. We split the 3 combination plate with 2 tacos and enchilada. Looks like a amazing outdoor patio. Huge disappointment to be told 40 minutes on fresh tortillas. It's the item they brag on and not available.  We arrived at 2:30pm but full parking lot and lots of full tables. Fresh tortillas are the reason we venture out to authentic Mexican.  Tacos were ok. Enchilada was wonderful."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner June 2nd to celebrate my friend's birthday: we ordered drinks and never saw our server again after he brought them 25 minutes went by. The saving grace? I went up to the front and said something and we got a new server who was amazing and apologetic. I ordered another drink and she said that ut (along with three other drinks) were on the menu but unavailable. She recommended a watermelon cocktail that was, however, DELICIOUSI ordered fish tacos that were delicious and my friend was very happy with her  chicken fajitas. I have been coming here for years and live the atmosphere and patio. Eventhough this location is not in a nice neighborhood like the Surprise location, this one is worth visiting. I unfortunately had to give them 3 stars due to the wait time for service otherwise, I highly recommend. I will note that food is not as spicy as some might like though children and seniors would appreciate this fact."}
{"text":"The only reason why I did not rate as 5 stars was the very slow end service. It took 20 minutes for the waiter to pick up the payment and cash us out. Otherwise the food was great! I will be returning."}
{"text":"We love coming to Rio Mirage when we are on the west side.  We have come in several times with a group of 8+ and everytime we are accomodated quickly and with execellent service!  The food is always amazing and had never disappointed.  Two people at our table tried the Bonitarita and the Margarita..wow...the Bonitarita knocked it out of the park.  It is a great margarita...it is a little more expensive but worth every penny!!  We also ordered fajitas (two of us split the order), I was so impressed with the number of shrimp and veggies in the order, but a little disappointed they only gave 2 tortillas."}
{"text":"My family and I just came to have brunch and the waiter wasn't friendly. She would take so long to come back to bring our drinks. We also had the complementary champagne that comes with the brunch. When we asked her if she could refill our glass, she said that it's only 2 per customer!! This is the first time I go to a place for Sunday brunch that only serves 2 glass of champagne per customer!! The food wasn't as I expected. Won't come back here again!"}
{"text":"My mother took me here a while back and I finally wanted to write a review. Rio mirage, both locations, has really good Mexican food. My favorite thing on (or maybe off) the menu is the flaming Toritos. That's what you want to come for. On another note, I think it's really tired and old to age bash residents of sun city and sun city west. Show some respect.  What are you people?  15 years old?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we have ordered from here many times prior to tonight and never had any issues.  Until tonight.  I always order the Burrito De Fajitas with chicken.   This time, it had 4 pieces of chicken and was filled.....I mean filled with onion.  Not even fresh onion.  It tasted like it sat out for two days before it was cooked.  I couldnt eat past the first couple of bites.  This is ridiculous!  I will not be returning after this experience.   You've lost two customers due to this.    I have pictures to add if yelp let's me..."}
{"text":"It's okay.   I went back again after misremembering that it was the same the last time I went.  There are lots of options in the Phoenix suburbs--I will continue to look to those."}
{"text":"My parents and I are visiting my grandpa who lives in the area. Yelpers said this was the Mexican place to go! So glad we did! The previous reviews did not lie.   We arrived around 6 and the place was packed! They were understaffed tonight so the wait was longer than usual. No big deal.   The food was awesome. Huge portions. Plenty of choices. Reasonable prices. The margaritas were good as well. They could have been a little stronger, but that's okay given that we were driving. I hope my grandpa comes back because we certainly would if we lived in the area!"}
{"text":"I have come here every time I've gone to Arizona. So when my grandma recommended we go here for authentic Mexican food and margarita's I was super stoked.  Sadly this place blew it on every level. When we came in we were told it was a 5 minute wait. Instead we waited 15 minutes. I didn't really care because I was hungry. We were finally sat down and I realized it was so hot in the restaurant that I started sweating.  But I was so excited for the food that I looked past this.  Finally the waitress came. She recognized my grandma and remembered her order. And took it. So then it came my turn to order so I tried to order my food and drinks. The waitress literally told me that she would not take my food order. I was super confused because she took my alcohol order but wouldn't give me food. I ended up getting a jumbo margarita on the rocks. So when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me. I told the manager he questioned my age and then tried to card me again. So I ended up getting carded twice for a drink that took me 15 minutes to get!  While we were waiting for our drinks and food I realized it literally took 30 minutes for them to clear a table. I don't know if they were short staffed or just did not care but the restaurant was messy and the staff was super rude.  By this time I was starving, sweaty, and drunk before she even decided to take my order. This waitress what the rudest person I have ever met! I ended up ordering the enchiladas del mas. Which was a seafood enchilada. In the past they were amazing. But this time it took 30 minutes to get my food. The tortillas were stale and tasted like cardboard. The fish and seafood were rubbery and the only thing that was good was the refried beans and rice. Seriously though, how hard is refried beans and rice. You can't mess that up!!!   By the end of the night I was drunk, sweaty and hungry. his was possibly the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. I have never gotten disrespected so much in a place I was a patron.  If my family hadn't gotten good service here and good food and drinks I would have complained to the manager. But since I was the only one who had an inedible meal I just left. You could not pay me to come back here. And I'm making it a point to tell the people of yelp about the horrible service I received here. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were fresh, and they kept them coming without us ever having to ask for more.  I had the lunch special, Chile Relleno, with refried beans and rice, and all three items were fresh.  Can't ask for much better in Mexican food.....will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Good, quality food.  Friendly staff.  Bummed I missed the $ .99 margaritas."}
{"text":"Currently sitting at the table... arrived at 9:12 pm closing time is 10 pm. Realize that we arrived 48 mins til closing. Not only were we hurried to order but our server looked at his watch and pointed at it and said \"we're going to close\". The staff were obnoxious and cussing at one another. When the plates arrived they were piping hot and couldn't even eat fast enough since they wanted us to hurry and leave. We weren't even half way through our late dinner and they were already asking if we wanted boxes for our food. Very rude. The food was good but the atmosphere was not welcoming."}
{"text":"Excellent food,great atmosphere,phenomenal service! Great spot for a large group, next time we're in town we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered their speciality borritio, El Rico. It was a absolutely amazing! I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour at the bar for our food and then didn't get what we ordered no explanation or apology. We will not go back very disappointing"}
{"text":"We've been going to Rio Mirage Cafe for many years, since before we were even Surprise residents, and 9 times out of 10, we have had a great experience.  The food has always been hot and yummy.  Never had a complaint about the food.  Good margaritas,  Great value, not too expensive but not the cheapest Mexican food out there.  The customer service is almost always on point.  We have had a few servers that weren't so friendly (end of night, not busy, but seemed bothered by us) but MOST of the time, they are friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Rio Mirage, give them a try, and don't forget to order a margarita."}
{"text":"I usually goto the other Rio Mirage location. This was a great location for dinner with my folks, dad has a hearing aid and always complains of too much noise. Place has cozy seating with booths and seating in dark corners. You can seat yourself at the tables by the bar or wait in the que. at 7:30pm it was a 15 minute wait. Huge portions and carb overload of course. Great service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very good food. Busy on Mondays. Parking is tight but worth a short walk. Authentic Mexican. Will go back."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this location and they have sold me for life.  Amazing customer service and delicious food.  The 99 cent margaritas on Monday don't hurt either ;)"}
{"text":"An unfortunate bad experience. We stopped for lunch and ordered a caldo de res and a carne asada.  The caldo was so salty we could not eat it. The Carne asada y as a tough cut of meat without any flavor. Tortillas we're hard."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and tried this place based on the reviews. It is Soooo good! Probably one of the best chicken chimi I have had. I got it with the jalapeno cream cheese. The guacamole is really good. The ambiance is warm, colorful and inviting. The service was fast and friendly. The beans and rice were very good, and so was the salsa. I would definitely recommend this as a place for a date or friends night out."}
{"text":"This review is totally about the food.  It is fantastic.  We went on a Monday, first time there, and didn't know it was margarita Monday so it was a madhouse.  99 cent margaritas with food purchase.  The server was very non-talkative, rushed and busy and kind of left us there to find our check at the end of the meal, but the food was hot and really good so we were happy.  I have had Mexican food all over the US and I am so picky, and am super happy to find this place.  Just be prepared to wait a long time on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Rio Mirage in El Mirage has gotten kind of blah. The food used to be spicer, more flavorful, just had some pop to it. The service has been meh as well the last few visits. This most recent visit, he never came to check on us nor did we get a single refill. I hope that they will take this to heart as a long time El Mirage resident who has been a regular customer that they should NOT tone down the flavor of the food to satisfy the old-sters who only come for a few months out of the year. If you are wondering why your place isn't as packed when those folks go home--now you know why!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and still the best buffet in town! The food takes me to another place, as if I'm in Mexico City again! Full of flavor and not just thrown together.   The service was ok. Felt like was being a little rushed but it's all good. I do appreciate the hostess she was nice. I will definitely be coming back and inviting other people."}
{"text":"Amended review: we walked in for a Sunday dinner and the girl said they closed at 8p. When I responded it was only 7.45p she said that she didn't think we could eat that fast. The place was full of people...Does that mean they kick everyone out at 8p? It was very unprofessional on top of not making any sense. She just didn't want to serve us and stay later. Won't be back.  Original review: Really liked this place, one of the better texmex places I've eaten at in az. Was pleased to see them doing a deep cleaning while they were slow. The waiter recommend the Rio Burrito which was delicious. Topped off with .99 margaritas on Monday. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The locals favorite Mexican restaurant for sure.  Best salsa and chips in town and the prices are reasonably especially from their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I got this tip from a fellow yelper who told me to try this place, and I wish we would have gone earlier in the trip because we would have gone back a couple of times. The food was awesome!! The best chips and salsa, I couldn't get enough of them, very crisp and not greasy at all, salsa was fresh and chunky and full of flavor.  For dinner, my hubby got the El Rico Burrito, it was the best, it was a cross between a burrito and a Chimichanga, with the best sauce covering the top. Give it a try you won't be disappointed! I ordered the Spinach and Chicken Enchiladas, you get 2 larges ones and they were very good also, served with beans and rice. Everything was wonderful and fresh, also the Margaritas on Saturday are 1/2price which is a big plus.  We had 2 jumbo ones each, and they really buzzed us up, good thing we ate big meals!  This is a cute quaint place, decorated very well with the Mexican flare, made you feel like you were there!  Now the reason for the 4 stars instead 5,  I was going to give the 5 until we both went into the bathrooms, each bathroom had a lot of water on the floor, not sure where it was coming from but it needed to be mopped up.  In the women's someone had used the toilet and did not flush, it was not pretty. If they regularly would have checked them it would have been noticed since there is only toilet.   Don't let that scare you off, it must have overlooked that night, they were very busy at the time.  Rio Mirage Café Y Cantina is worth the trip! Try it out sometime!"}
{"text":"Ok I am updating it again!!! From 2 to 5 stars!!! Love this place and glad that service changed , except for Jose!!!!! Great people and great food!!! Love it!!!!! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos.  They were amazing.  We both loved them.  The salsa is great, and the atmosphere is very festive.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved everything. The salsa , the beans, the service, the ambiance, the food, the portions. I tend to be a bit picky about Mexican food.  The parking lot was packed when we arrived at 8 pm and it's an odd location. I finally found a restaurant I'll go back to time and again."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Mexican dinner place in Surprise. All food is fresh hot tasty... it beats all the rest"}
{"text":"Great food  Great service  The hostess is very nice Clean restaurant  Clean bathroom  Very friendly place to eat at."}
{"text":"Just left the Sunday buffet at the \"Rio\" and had a great meal! I was able to meet the Alda today who is the resturant manager and we discussed a small issue I noticed at the buffet today. I have to say that she has done an excellent job since we first discovered the \"Rio\" about 6-8 months ago.  I wish her and the \"familia\" the best for thier two resturant locations!   - Daniel -  ;-)"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Rio Mirage (the original location in El Mirage) for years.  The food here is really good and we've always had great service.  The service gets a little slow on Margarita Monday, but that is expected."}
{"text":"What a surprise it was finding this place. Amazing tortillas made fresh as you order. Not often do I give five stars."}
{"text":"First time at the original location.  Love the restaurant. Classic Mexican food. I ordered a shrimp burrito and it was outstanding! Their rice and beans are exceptionally good as well!  I also ordered a sangria. Different than what I was expecting-they add orange juice to the wine-but good and refreshing nonetheless!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love buying fresh tortillas by the dozen also. Owners is very friendly and always walking around. Only reason for 4 stars is the salsa tastes a bit sweeter than it used to. Not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Server sucked but food was good. Waited quite awhile for someone to even take drink order.  Then had to ask for her to place food order.  Never saw her again. Someone else brought food and our bill."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!! We had Mother's Day brunch here and the food was amazing. We will continue to come back for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Still like this location. However, lost a star since the recording says they are open at 9:00am on Sunday for brunch. Sitting here at 9:45 and still not open."}
{"text":"I believe this might be the best Mexican food I have had in Phoenix.    To start, be ready for a possible walk....because their parking lot sucks!  haha  It's just too small.  I often have to park in the dirt lot across the street by the train tracks.  However....once you are inside, it is wonderful!  The place is well-kept and clean.  Atmosphere is great.  All of the staff are friendly, and the Managers are usually running around helping out and just chatting with the customers.    The food is Awesome!  I have been several times now with friends and family, and have tried many of their dishes.  My personal favorite is their specialty burrito - the El Rico!  Great mix of ingredients and spices.    If you get a chance, stop in.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Rio Mirage is an amazing small spot in El Mirage!!  Great drinks! Chips and salsa!  Sunday Brunch is delicious!!  Service is always quick and friendly !!!"}
{"text":"Good Service. Enjoyed the chimichanga, which was with shredded beef and delicious.   Someone else at our table had the beef enchiladas and enjoyed them as well.  Great salsa with chips as well. The location was hard to find the first time but now that I've been there, it is easier.  Parking can be hard, but you can park on the street with no problem.  Get there early for no wait during dinner."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is goooooood. When we got there they said there would be a 40 minute wait, but we were seated within 15. I can see why they were so busy! I had the combo with the green corn tamale and chile relleno with a side of flour tortillas. My fiancé had the spinach enchiladas. The flour tortillas were being handmade in a corner of the restaurant and omg they were delicious. The chile relleno was super flavorful but the breading was a little thin. The tamale was so good! It was full of corn and cheese. The spinach enchiladas were different but they were very tasty. They had a red sauce on them and not a ton of cheese, but they were very flavorful. The margarita was very good, not too sweet. Our total bill for two entrees, a margarita and a beer was 29 and change. They also had a mariachi band playing which was fun. Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"I was back here a couple of days ago with my family. And although I remember The food being a lot better than this time around. I was kind of disappointed.   The service was okay since I had no Jose this time. Nothing to mention here just refills chips salsa and beverages when you need and food when it's ready. This waitress was just doing her job. And I guess that's fine for a lot of people but not for me remembering how this place used to be.   At no time did the waitress hostess or owner manager came by our table to ask us how our food was.   This magical Mexican Cantina has lost it's magic"}
{"text":"We took a break from the Christmas shopping craziness and had dinner at Rio Mirage tonight. The food was delicious.   Chips and salsa are complimentary. The chips were a little oily, like they had been re-fried to reheat, but the salsa is sooo good!  Hub had a fried burrito (chimichanga) enchilada style. The steak inside was super tender and flavorful.   As usual, I ordered more than I could eat.  I ordered albondigas (meatball soup), mainly because I have made it but never eaten a restaurant version (and I was cold). It was great and would have filled me up all on its own. Savory meatballs, carrots, celery, onions, potatoes, cabbage (I think) and rice, floating in a thick chili broth. Comfort food.   For main course I had Mahi Mahi tacos, with double beans since I don't like  rice much. Cubes of well seasoned fish, grilled and served in soft fried corn tortillas (soft but not dry) with lots of perfectly ripe avacado chunks. With a jicima pineapple salsa on the side. I prefer a cabbage slaw with fish tacos, but it was good. The beans were black beans, which I love, evenly cooked and topped with cheese. Luscious.  My margarita was made from a mix, but, hey, this is a low priced neighborhood restaurant. They did get the lightly salted rim part spot-on!   No room for dessert!  All of the service was great, from greeting to drinks to packing up my leftovers.  Erik is an awesome waiter. Give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"This place is a good lunch break spot if you are on your lunch break and have an entire hour to spare. The service seems to always be great, but it can get pretty crowded during lunch.  If you are in Surprise and have a more authentic Mexican food craving and alternative to Chipotle and Caramba's where you can sit down, kick back and have a few margaritas, then this place is your choice.   The tacos and lunch enchilada specials can never be beat during lunch. When you order the fish tacos or enchiladas del mar (with shrimp), the soft taco shells are soft and oily versus just regular soft flaky corn tortillas or crunchy type tortillas. I just end up eating the inside of the taco, so it's a bit rich for my taste to eat the oiliness. Don't get me wrong, I know that when I'm eating Mexican, it's not necessarily going to be healthy, but it gets overwhleming when you have 2 layer soggy taco shells to eat per taco so it doesn't fall apart on you.   Chimichangas are pretty good here. Again, not really the typically true Mexican fare, but they satiate the craving for crunchy friedness filled with shredded beef or chicken goodness. Overall, this place is \"A-OK\" in my book, but nothing overally spectacular."}
{"text":"Hidden gem here in the Phoenix area. Was very crowded but able to get a seat outside. Great pre game chips and salsa and guacamole.  Fish tacos were top notch."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on the reviews, glad we did!  The coyote margaritas are awesome, very nice flavors. Food wise, I had the Carne machaca  dinner which was also very good!  Service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"You know how you go to a place for the first time and its totally awesome.. then you go back sometime later and the experience is not as good then the first.. thats Rio Mirage in El Mirage, AZ.  The first time we stopped in this place was awesome! They had the yummiest rice and beans.. as well as very good chimi's enchiladas etc.. but since the first time we've been there it just hasn't been as good.. the rice dry and greasy.. the beans, run of the mill.. food being burnt and greasy, greasy, greasy.. spotty service and in my opinion sub par ingredients make this place now an avoid.. what a shame too since they had so much going for them. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican restaurant. We went for Marguerita Monday for $1 Rita's. Off menu is a pork carnita plate that is super. I ordered the chili rellano and green tamale.   The tamale was overly sweet and the rellano was just okay."}
{"text":"The mariachi band really made our visit enjoyable. The food was great, and so was my margarita. The enchilada sauce was spiced differently than what we expected, but who wants the same old thing every time?  The only thing that detracted from our experience was that our virgin daiquiri was a bit more expensive than we expected. It costs more than did my medium margarita! Overall, though, I am convinced that this will be our \"go to\" Mexican restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Well prepared and served with ride in this authentic restaurant. Presentation as well as atmosphere are only outdone by the quality drinks, food and service. Don't miss the pride of El Mirage. It is simply the best! RB"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great and feels like your eating authentic Mexican food not like Chipotle! I prefer the El Mirage location over the Surprise location because of its authenticy and the fact that its the original! If you go try the El Rico burrito in beef or chicken, or half and half you won't be disappointed! Only drawback is it that during our cooler Arizona months its packed with snowbirds!"}
{"text":"They gave us a buzzer to call us when our table would be ready. We we're the only people waiting to be seated but other people would walk in and they would sit them right away. Finally someone noticed that we haven't gotten a table then apologized for not seating us before other groups. Once we got to our table, someone came and brought chips and salsa, 5min later someone brings us utensils, 5mins more chips and salsa... We waited 20mins til someone took our order. The server that waited on us kept saying over and over that he wasn't our server so it felt like we were just a bother so we didn't ask for a drink refill or anything so we sat there thirsty. Ordered chicken nuggets for our son and they were burnt. The Pollo special was bland and I don't see a point frying it when it's drenched in sauce making it soggy. The ambience was nice though. Live mariachi band, cute restaurant but I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"I have had more than my fair share of Mexican food but this place is no-questions-asked the best Mexican food I have ever had. Unless your question is 'what should I get?' Our server recommended El Rico and his recommendation did not fail me. Chicken, poblano peppers, onions, mushrooms, jalapeño cream cheese... Oh, jalapeño cream cheese. Then smothered in cheese and whatever other heavenly stuff they did to that burrito. Pure perfection. If I'm ever back in Arizona, I will certainly find my way here just to order El Rico again."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time with friends, will not be back. Sat at the bar for almost 10 minutes before bartender even acknowledged us. Once we were seated it was fine  waiter was nice, took our order right away, but once the food came it was a different story. Someone else brought our food, my friend and I ordered fajitas and we're not given our tortillas. It took 10 to 15 minutes before I was able to flag down our waiter to ask for them, when he brought the tortillas back we told him that our meal  hot and he offered to \"reheat\" them... we declined, as our other friends had almost finished their meals.  He never asked us if we wanted another round of drinks. He brought the bill and didn't take anything off our bill or offer free desert to compensate. I asked for the manager who listened, apologized, and said he'd adjust the bill; our waiter brought the bill back telling us he had taken $5 off each of our meals.  As we were leaving, the manager came back to offer us a $10 off coupons. We turned them down because we felt disappointed in how they handled our situation...why would we want to come to back here?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just found this place and loved it so much we went back two days later. We've lived here in AZ for about four years and haven't really been able to find a good Mexican place but this place is by far the best Mexican good we've had here. Very good margaritas as well. I also I want to say the staff has morals because I left a pair of sunglasses there and didn't realize it until the next day, called them and they still had them. They made my day!! I was almost in tears thinking there was no way they still have them. They were a gift from my daughter and she's currently in BMT and I've missed her so much. You can't replace a gift so whoever turned them in, thank you so much!! You made my day!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food we've found near Surprise, az.  i like their Sunday brunch but i LOVE that they have mariachi on fridays!  so even if i can cook some of their dishes with more flavor, i will come for the mariachi."}
{"text":"We went for Saturday lunch which was excellent. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The decor was excellent.   The portions were very generous and we enjoyed everything from the chips and salsa to our entrees to our drinks.   Definitely a return visit in our near future."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know what you're thinking... \"this guy leaves a lot of 5 star reviews\"... Damn right I do!!  Because the places I choose are either based off Yelp or word of mouth recommendations.  Anyways, back to the review... When we visit my parents in Surprise we usually hit up Macayos... that day is done!  My wife and I agreed that Rio Mirage is added to our Phoenix Bucket List (along with In N Out and Don Pancho's).  Their food was fantastic!  I also tried their habenero salsa and it melted my face off, I had to slam 3 frozen margs till I got the sensation back in my head.  Well done Rio Mirage!  Our server rocked and as I looked around their authentic atmosphere everyone working there was busting their asses off!!  It was great to see.   My burrito was muy grande and bursting with deliciousness!   I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Overall the experience was great! As me and a friend walked in, we were greeted with a smile. The atmosphere felt like we were in Mexico and the band playing only added to the experience! They were very enjoyable to listen to! The food was tasty, especially the retried beans and guac. I recommend you visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! great mexican food, authentic mariachi band and awesome margis.... what's not to like?"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places around. The owner always greats you with a smile. Lately it has been kinda a hit and miss. But still good. Sunday Brunch is always fun."}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"sit down\" Mexican restaurants. Their chimichangas are the best! The only problem I've ever had there is the slow service, but the food makes up for it every time."}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law have taken me to this place several times during my visits from San Diego. Atmosphere is truly what one would expect from a Mexican Restaurant and the people working there welcome you at the door. A lady makes the tortillas right there to order. I always have the chimichanga and it is fabulous."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas, the food was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere! A true gem and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the food, +1 star for the ambiance & service :)   Having said that, they put cheese on EVERYTHING.... luckily they didn't douse the drinks, lol!  I don't know, when it comes to real Mexican food, I'm a purist :) If you're going to put cheese on something then let it be an authentic Mexican cheese! I don't like my food smothered in Jack, American or any other Velveta like substance :(  Now, I'm sure that if you ask for no cheese they will oblige! Learn from my mistakes :)   The machaca I salvaged from beneath the layer of cheese was good.   I did not want the rice & beans (don't judge me) so the waiter asked if I wanted a salad instead. I said YES, & could it have avocados? Oh yeah!  I did get my salad. Iceberg lettuce, little tomato & about 3 slices of avocado. I ate the avocado & when my bill came realized that although I did not get rice & beans my meal was priced the same AND I was charged extra for the avocado. I paid it, but I don't think I'll do that again.   I did not have any alcoholic beverages, just coffee, & that was not great either."}
{"text":"Have gone here 2x. First time was during the week at 2:00. Taken right to a table. Love the salsa. Just right amount of flavor. Also really liked my chicken enchiladas. Red sauce is yummy. But on 2nd visit at 1:00 on a Sunday, had a 2 minute wait which they said would be 10 minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even half full. Maybe short handed? We could tell a couple waitresses were rushed and not very happy. Took a bit to get our chips and salsa even. Food finally came, didn't like the fajita burrito as much as my first meal. Same good red sauce, but had dark meat chicken and I only like white meat. A couple at a table by us got up and left because they were tired of waiting. Not sure if I will return myself. Seems like it might be hit and miss with this place."}
{"text":"Half-priced margaritas on Saturdays? WOO HOO!   We've taken our family here for dinner, maybe 10-12 times over the past 9 years. That doesn't really represent how much we like the food; we're just usually shuttling around other parts of town.   So here's what to like:  1. Consistently good Mexican food. From their standard combos to the chef's selections, everything we've tried on the menu has been really good. Yum!  2. Chips & salsa until the cows come home. And it's really fresh salsa with super-tasty, hot chips in a bottomless bowl. Yum!  3. Fresh tortillas, hot off the press. You can even buy a dozen for about $4... it seems pricey until you taste 'em. Yum!  4. My little chitlins actually eat the rice and beans here. Nowhere else. Weird, eh?  5. Did I mention half-priced margaritas... on SATURDAY?? We got their jumbo-sized house margaritas for $4. Even better, the bartender did not have a light hand. The worst part was deciding who got to drink, and who had to stay sober to drive... lol  6. VERY reasonably priced. Dinner for five, with alcohol, was under $70, including tip... AND we had leftovers.  7. Their whole menu is available to-go. Score!  8. Friendly, efficient staff. I've never had to wonder where our meals, drinks or bill were, and everyone is smiling and courteous. BIG plus in my book.  9. Mariachi music... ole!   Not so great:  1. Yeah. It's right by Sun City, which means a lot of golden oldies. More power to them, though, as they appear to lap up those margaritas like water. Just wish they weren't driving after... :/ 2. The parking lot ain't great. This place can fill up, making parking only possible across the road... next to the railroad tracks. Meh.   So based on my scientific analysis above, this place is a good value for a great, casual Mexican dining experience. Great spot to hit, on the way to/from the lake or Vegas, or if you're a local!"}
{"text":"This is the best mexican food I have ever eaten! Everything was fresh and so tasty! The service was great too! I just moved to Arizona a couple of months ago and this restaurant is by far in the top 5 of my new favorite places to eat. I practically cleaned my plate. I ordered the cheese crisps for the appetizer. So yummy! I also got the enchiladas del mar and it was so flavorful! I would highly recommend this place. I know you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute building and festive interior.  Friendly staff from the instant you walk in the door.  You kinda feel like friends coming to visit and having a delicious meal!  Food was really good!  We left happy and full.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok.   We were invited here for dinner and our friend who invited us loved it, and she paid, so i kinda feel bad that i didn't like it half as much as she did.  We had a GREAT time with our friend and that's what matters here.    The first thought we had when we walked in was,  \"Where are all the locals?\"  It made me think that there must be a better place for authentic Mexican food. I think i was right. I want to find THAT place and go eat.   My carne asada was bland and colorless. The meat didn't have that char or defined grill marks that add so much flavor. It had more of a steamed light brown look and didn't have much  flavor at all.  I was disappointed.   The chips were good and light and not too oily. The homemade tortillas were good.   The bar area,  isn't really a bar area.   there were a few high top tables between the front door and the bar but there was no defined area for the bar seating.  We had people sitting in chairs waiting to be seated right behind and next to us.  It was pretty awkward.    The margaritas were marginal and not freshly mixed. They were super weak and poured from a pitcher. Again,  dissapointed.   I want authentic Mexican food where the locals go. Not just a place where others think the locals will go.  This resturant was in predominately residential area without the local demographic representation. What I mean to say is that there seemed to be a lack of Mexican and Hispanic patrons in here.  Where were they and where are they eating?  That's where I want to go."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!  It had been a bit since I had been to rio but we had a coupon from a local fundraiser.  Chips were warm and fresh, had the Rico special with beef and hubby had the pollo especial.   Both were excellent but I will do chicken in the rio next time.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's ok.  The wait staff was really really slow.  The food was good but greasy. It's location is hard to find."}
{"text":"Can't say anything about the food, as we were never served.  We never saw a server, even after sitting at our table for 15 minutes. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this restaurant!!  The location was not an issue and was easy  to get to. The food was fresh, authentic, and delicious! Chips are made daily and the salsa was the best we have ever had. Portions are plentiful and most entrees include rice and beans, both which are very good. We will definitely be back to try other menu choices!"}
{"text":"Wow best Mexican food so far. I live out in surprise and it's not to far. Food is amazing. Staff is so friendly. This is our new place!"}
{"text":"we went to this place with a group of 8 people. the restaurant was VERY busy but we got in promptly. we had the $.99 margaritas which were fine. my wife and I split the chicken fajitas which were excellent. I'm not sure how one person could possibly eat them all.  the flour tortillas are made on site and are amazing. service was prompt and pleasant. prices are very reasonable.  a great find!!,"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great ambiance. My only complaint is I wish they had better or more spaces to park as it gets crowded here quick. Otherwise the staff is friendly, the food is served fairly quick, and the restaurant is cute with a nice Spanish background. Also, the food here is not very spicy but still packs a punch of flavors."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Ambiance was awesome, shrimp tacos were to die for and the service was awesome. Will come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Friday's are fun and entertaining with the Mariachi band - they add to the atmosphere and the food is great !"}
{"text":"Walked in and was looked at by 2 employees, stood there for a few minutes then watched as the server took a phone call while looking at me, then put her finger up in the (universal sign for hang on) Amazingly, continued on to the couple that had walked in about 90 sec after me an proceeded to help them. I was a single person nust looking to grab a bit to eat... Hey ownership, I'm new to the area and lookikg for a place to spend my money, it wont be with you."}
{"text":"We have been long time customers at this location. The service has always been great! However, the last 2-3 times we have eaten here the food has been off. Our chicken in the pollo especial tasted old, like the taste of chicken that has sat in the fridge to long after being cooked. And the chips had a very weird dust taste to them. We notified our server about the chips and she brought us out a new batch that tasted even worse! We now drive the extra 5 miles to the surprise location. The food there is much better!"}
{"text":"This place is a 5-Star neighborhood gem. It serves excellent Sonoran Mexican food, fresh tortillas, flavorful salsa & chips, tasty 99 cent Margaritas (on Mondays) all by very friendly servers.  The beef fajita salad is really tasty, their salsa is some of the best, the food comes fast and hot. And a big plus, the Carnitas plate is back for our winter season (see photo). I took half of it home there was so much!"}
{"text":"We just move to Goodyear from Texas.  The food here is 5 star awesome.  The chicken El Rico was so tender, juicy and flavorful.  The service was great and the atmosphere was authentic.  We have found our place."}
{"text":"We stopped by the day before Cinco de Mayo to get our fix and we were pleasantly surprised at what this place had to offer. The pitcher of margaritas hit the spot. My daughter loved her kids meal. The only reason I can't give it five stars is that we had to wait forever for the check."}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be my last.  Outstanding service and great food.  Wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for new Mexican spots to try out as it's my favorite cuisine.  Had visitors in town and so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived at 5 on a Friday and we just beat the rush.  After ordering a happy hour margarita at the bar we were seated.  Many people arrived after us and you could tell there was a long wait.   Chips and salsa were great.  A nice little kick to the salsa.  The menu is really nice but a little confusing the way they have it put together-I kept missing items!  I'd think I knew what I wanted to order and then bam, an item I'd somehow not seen would pop up and I'd want to change.  I ended up with the Tomatillo Enchiladas which were delicious.  Everyone in our party of 7 were quite pleased!  We had just received our bill when the mariachi band showed up.  They found a spot right next to our table and we were able to enjoy a couple songs which the kids LOVED.   Also you can take home their amazing and fresh tortillas for a decent price.  I'm going to remember that little factoid! We are very pleased we tried this location-the music, fun decor and ambiance added to our night and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"We met at this restaurant with our friends. It was half way for both. It was on a Sunday and very, very, very nosiy. But should have known as alot of people are out on Sunday after Church. Food was okay, nothing to write home about. My order was wrong, instead of the Taco I got a tamale. The tamale was sweet and to much masa, very little filling. Really could not tell what was in it. The Chili Relleno was good. not much breading wtih some fire in the chili. Rice and Beans were so, so. We were a party of five and tho I did not check with the rest, I did notice food left on the plates. Margarita was excellent. Will we go again. Of course. Can not judge a place by the first visit. Salsa needs work. I refer to it as \"Gringo Salsa\""}
{"text":"With my minnie me in a so needed outing.......NEVER EVER have I had anything bad here.....ALWAYS GREAT FOOD & SERVICE. I recommend U give them a try if U already haven't.....U will be back"}
{"text":"Food comes out to you hot and fresh, in generous servings. Service is friendly, venue is big, and features colonial Mexican decor indoors and a large outdoor patio for seating large groups. Overall good experience. But, menu is somewhat limited in that no ala carte single items are offered, nor any carnitas or pork dishes. Our party of three enjoyed the dinners, but were mostly unimpressed by  the sauces which seemed somewhat bland. Would try this restaurant again but for happy hour instead. Or, maybe Friday night for Mariachis performance."}
{"text":"Ok, Midwest guys, best ever Mexican.  Why?  Authentic.  More locals than snowbirds which tells you something.  Right flavors on my mexican comfort food list.  The homemade red sauce on the cheese enchilada.  The tender beef chunks in the red burro with just the right, again, red sauce that was different than the enchilada sauce.    The lovely Maureen had the mahi tacos with chunks of fresh avocados. Homemade corn tortillas not the standard flour tho that's available.  Environment is fine: that's not the reason to come here."}
{"text":"When I moved to Arizona from Chicago 3 years ago, I thought I would find the best Mexican  food ever.  But I soon learned all Mexican food is not created equal.  Thank goodness for Rio Mirage Cafe.  It fulfilled my dreams of wonderful flavored beans and rice, warm tortillas, fresh made salsa and the best fajitas ever.  And did I mention the 99 cent frozen Margaritas (Monday special)?  The tortilla chips and salsa are so good, it's a \"can't stop eating them\" experience.  And at Rio Mirage  the baskets and bowls are kept filled.  The sizzling plate of steak fajita so delicious and so much, certainly more than enough for 2 people so most of it when home to be enjoyed again tomorrow.  The service was great.  We were a group of 17, with separate checks for everyone and Juan C, our server, was kept busy.  Head to Rio Mirage if you're in the mood for wonderful Mexican food where you are welcomed when you arrive and thanked when you leave.  And did I mention the 99 cent Monday frozen Margaritas?  Delicious!"}
{"text":"We went at the height of the dinner rush on Friday.  We wanted something different outside of Surprise and this was just what we were looking for.  The place was packed.  Lots of retirees and locals it appeared.  I would give the Rio Mirage (3.5)  4 Stars overall since there is not an option for halves.     Ambience: 4 stars!  The  Rio Mirage was a nice old school mexican restaurant with plenty of seating.  Very well kept and clean. I also noticed that there was patio seating which looked comfy.  I would like to sit out there next time on a nice night.   We also loved the roaming mariachi band.  That was a nice touch and the kids loved them.  Lastly,  another note...when and if you try this place, you may expect to wait to be seated, but rest assured you won't go thirsty.  The bartender is stationed right next the entrance and the margaritas are pretty tasty.  I upgraded to the ulitmate, to get a splash of grand marnier.  3 stars on the margaritas.  Food: I give the food 4 stars.   My wife ordered the fish tacos, which looked great. Fried white fish and shredded cabbage on a corn tortilla.  She gave them 2 thumbs up.   The kids had the \"Kid's Taco\" meal,  which came with a choice of beans.  They devored most of thier meals.  Their tacos were fried with shredded beef, lettuce & tomatoes.    I had the El Bombero Picado.  Strips of asada steak, covered in a green sauce with sauted peppers and onions.   It was real tasty, but was not as spicy as the menu was leading on.   However, real good.  My meal came with rice and beans on the side and a choice of tortillas.  I chose the \"homemade\" flour tortillas, 2 large tortillas (equivalent to 4 regular sized).  They were awesome.   My meal was great, I would just make a note to have them exclude the melted cheese on my beans next time.  It was a little \"overkill\" , but not a dealbreaker.  I just scraped the cheese off and it they were set.  The rice was nice and fluffy,  real subtle, with a great flavor.   Service: 2 stars.  I am giving our server the benefit of the doubt, SIMPLY because she was very friendly and helpful when we did get her attention.   She just seemed very overwhelmed and maybe she was having an \"off night\", which may likely led her to forget my tortillas after asking her twice.  Lol!  Once I get the \"homemade\" tortillas...muy bien as mentioned above.  Everyone else seemed to be getting served promptly and had smiles on their faces, which was a plus.    Overall,  I would recommend this place.  It is worth your time to try.  Remember,  avoid the rush and tell them to hold the cheese on the beans!  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Only came in to pick up some of their homemade tortillas. One word, meal. I could eat an entire dozen just for dinner. Add a margarita and I'm done. Gotta try those tortillas!"}
{"text":"I never rate anyone this low.  Drinks were ok to good. What didn't impress me was the sub par service.  I felt the waitress was lacking patience and hospitality. Definitely an older crowd at this place but that made me think do others experience this? Hmm well I won't be returning can't comment on the food. I'm sure a different staff member would have made the experience more pleasant to the point I would of tried it a second time if desired.  The surprise location is always great to go to! Been there about 4 times."}
{"text":"Just OK. Friendly efficient service, but the food was not too flavorful. Three of us went and none of us were thrilled. On a good note, the chips and salsa and flour tortillas were good quality. I had to ask for the hot salsa though."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Flavors were awesome. We had the guacamole to start and shared the mahi mahi tacos and the chili relleno and tamale combo. The tamale was a sweet corn. Best ever. Great great food!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!  What a wonderful delight in the barrio! Cute and fun decor with a great atmosphere! Handmade flour tortillas sealed the deal for me! Hot, chewy, pillowy and just plain deliciosa!  Micheladas are so fun! Enjoyed the brunch which was amazing in their flavor and freshness. Did not taste like dishes had been sitting in warmer if you get my drift.   Chorizo egg scramble was yummy! Bacon and eggs are solid but unremarkable. Need to stick with the ethnic dishes-- puerco verde, enchiladas, sopa pasoles etc were amazing. Too full for the menudo and missed the chilaquiles. But the homemade churros are a must-have!  And best of all--very reasonable $$. A definite must-return not only for the brunch but the rest of the menu also."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican restaurant in the town of El Mirage. Food is good, atmosphere is old fashioned as if you were in a Mexican cantina. Old rustic building adds to the flavor.  I like the fajitas. A nice meal that can be shared. Wash it down with a margarita and you just saved a trip to Mexico!  Cool to sit outside on the back patio if it's not too hot outside. Inside the booths are cool too. I've been going here for years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent margarita, wonderful service. I had the chili relleno & taco .i ordered the large margarita it was HUGE and delicious. Really enjoyed my experience at the restaurant"}
{"text":"Very tasty but way overpriced.  You will leave hungry unless you order several plates of food."}
{"text":"A mixed crowd from Surprise & Sun City. Crowded but quick, efficient service.  Everybody loved their food... Guacamole was fresh and very good. The chicken & spinach enchiladas were yummy!!!!   I would definitely come back if in the area and might even drive from the other side of town for the incredibly delicious specialty Watermelon margarita drink (can't remember what it was called).  I think the guac and the enchiladas were described as \"spicy\" - I did ask the server about it as I'm a whimp and neither were spicy... So not sure if he adjusted or if you should order extra spicy if that's how you prefer it. Parking lot is tiny and you have to back out if it's full... Unless you can see that there is a spot, I'd just park along the street/railroad tracks.    Charming patio... Wish this was in my neighborhood..."}
{"text":"While looking for an old favorite Mexican restaurant we couldn't find, we stumbled upon Rio Mirage.  It was very busy, which is always a good sign.  We were not disappointed.  The food was very good but a tad bit pricey.  There weren't enough a la carte items.  However, the four of us all enjoyed our food.  We also went to the Rio Mirage in Sun City West, but for some reason the one in El Mirage seemed to be better and tastier."}
{"text":"Delicious. We arrived at 5:00 on a Wednesday and it was packed. They were out of the yummy looking drinks they advertised and it took awhile to get served but the chips are hot and fresh and once we ordered, it was fast.  The food was yummy and the mango margarita was delicious."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food we've found in Phoenix area, as well as best we've found. Well seasoned but not spicey hot. Salsa was the best and chips were fresh.  Lunch Special #2 Chicken Enchilada ($7) came with Mexican rice and refried beans excellent flavor. Two-item combination #5 Chile Relleno and Green Corn Tamale was superb. Tamale light and Relleno batter flavorful.  Omar gave us friendly quick service.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Went in this past Sunday about 10:30. We were seated promptly by a very friendly and open Manager. Our server came quickly to take our drink orders. He was not overtly friendly or chatty, but polite and thorough. The food came quickly. I ordered the Ensenada Fish Tacos which were MASSIVE and DEVINE!! My plate also came with Beans (topped with cheese) and rice, and a side of chopped lettuce and diced tomatoes. My kids ordered a side of beans and rice which tasted fresh and which they rated as AWESOME. My husband ordered the Chicken Nachos and they were HUGE!! He said he was starving going in, but was only able to finish off half of his plate (even with some help from our 6 year old). Our food was fantastic. The chips and salsa were so good that we ordered a bag of chips and a Quart of Salsa to go! Our server came several times during the meal checking on the levels of our drinks, and refilled quickly, but wasn't so overtly chatty or buggy that he interrupted our meal or conversation. I would DEFINITELY go back again. I was happy with the food and service.   ** I have also had their catered Platters which are kind of pricey, but HEAVENLY!! They serve mini tacos, mini chimis and mini taquitos, with sides of sour cream, salsa and guacamole and a bag of chips. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Been there twice both times food was excellent with good service and price is reasonable. Margarita's are huge and very good as well. Maybe we go tonight. Go eat at this place you wont regret it."}
{"text":"For the amount of time it took to get our food, you would have thought everything would be super fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, not the case. Had to wait 20 minutes to order and another 40 minutes for our food. Then 15 more minutes at the end of the meal to get our waiter's attention so we could pay. Probably could have walked out without them noticing. The food was average, and had it been quick and with great service might have warranted a better rating, but unfortunately nothing was stellar about this restaurant. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"The service was Great! The drinks were even better! And the Mexican pizza was better than I expected."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend, we have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant on this side of town. As you know, there aren't many. This place hit it out of the park. Walking in it is clean, bright and inviting. The staff is friendly and non intrusive. Beverages were filled and chips and salsa were flowing. The chips are those thin, light freshly fried kind that no one makes anymore. The salsa was fresh, not too spicy, a little heavy on the tomato. I like a little more onion and garlic in mine. That didn't slow me down from emptying 3 bowls of it! I had the mahi-mahi tacos with fresh slaw and pineapple relish. The fish was moist and flavorful and the corn tortillas were almost buttery. Margaritas are delightful!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the server took quite some time and they were out of more than a few items as far as drinks go. Shocking considering it was mother's day and cinco de may weekend. Regardless, a decent place if you don't mind the wait and the lack of some waiter complaints. Customers should never have to hear about the waiters many struggles."}
{"text":"I only have one warning about this restaurant.  The food is so amazing that you cannot eat Mexican food anywhere else.  My wife had the shrimp fajitas which huge shrimp and were cooked perfectly.   I had chicken and beef enchiladas which had homemade corn tortillas and the most tender meat I had ever tasted.  Pair it up with the margarita special and I was a happy camper.  I will be a customer for life here!"}
{"text":"The Fajita burrito and The Rio especial burrito are stuffed full of cooked onions with very little meat and at a cost of $14 a piece I find it very rude. The menu said topped with enchilada sauce but the entire plate was soaking in it. The rice was super dry and inedible. The salsa is good and drink prices are ok but they need to find a different burrito maker. Such an expensive disappointment for my birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Omg this was one of the worst experiences I ever had in a restaurant,  to start the lady at the front desk kept repeating her self that the restaurant was closing in 45 minutes , she turn around 2 Mexican families away, and then at 746 a White family shows up and guess what? They get an option of get there meals to go, unbelievable!  Its all about them apparently ...there is clear tables in the back of the restaurant but there are not longer available because is closing Time.  This manager in Duty is not in control,  the employees are... hahaha I'm a facility manager my self and this crew should be ashamed of there selfs .. one of the server's comes out and screams NO MoRE! ..I don't want nothing free I'm just gonna use my Christmas gift card and let my customers and friends know about the service on this place."}
{"text":"We had fond memories of this neighborhood restaurant when we lived in Surprise. Our return was disappointing. In fairness, we arrived just after the crest of the SunCity surge. The dude at the bar was great, while we waited for a table, churning out one marguarita after another.  The Cadillac marguarita was good but not likely to cause many dui's.   We had always been seated in the smaller back room in the high booths. Tonight we got a table in the front room which was \"bright\" to the point my ears hurt.  The salsa is to die for. We used to buy it by the quart. Food was -  ummm. I had a relleno/taco plate. The relleno was way above average but the chicken taco was a lost cause. The lady's had the carne which had good flavor but chewy.  Half of it came home for Chuck. Our waiter, bless his heart worked his patoot off, of a little militarialistic manner. Took our orders quick, brought the food out quick, brought the check quick, even before the ladies could talk themselves into the flan. Then vanished. Esto no fue bueno."}
{"text":"While I don't think there is a river or a mirage anywhere near this place, there does always seem to a large puddle of water in the parking lot. At least I think there is, unless, it's a mirage. Hmmm...What isn't a mirage is a restaurant full of local Latino families and a sea of blue haired, varicose veined, AARP folks from Sun City. I should know. Cuz my Sun City living mom and dad love Rio Mirage. This is where me and mom let loose and bond over a couple margs. While dad sips his ice tea and flirts with the waitress. I've had good luck ordering the same thing here. Carne Asada with beans and tortillas. I kinda put the steak in the tortilla, roll it up with some fixins. Chew. Smile. Chug more margarita. Mom loves the grilled quesadilla and dad's finicky ordering style is accommodated with \"ground beef tacos. Hard. Nothing fancy.\" We always get great service and I love the local vibe. And the margarita buzz gets me through an entire game of bridge with Big Daddy and Momma Jo!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  I recommend the Rio Rico burrito.  I would also like to compliment the ladies at the check-in counter.  I've been in the restaurant when the lobby area is mobbed with diners, and the ladies are always very polite and courteous.  First class restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and the margaritas are no joke! We have eaten here a few times and recently went with our son and some friends. My son (who lives in San Diego) lived it too! The homemade flour tortillas are no joke, my husband had the red chili and wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the El bombero. It was very good. Very authentic and delicious. The other 7 adults really enjoyed there meals also."}
{"text":"Second time here and both times the service and the food were great. The corn tortillas they use for the enchiladas have a nice texture. Overall the food is higher quality than most of the other Mexican restaurants in the valley"}
{"text":"My family & I have been coming here for almost 5 years. We've never had a bad experience. Discount Margarita nights are the best & my kids love the Mariachi band on the weekends. They opened a new one in Surprise, but it's not the same. The original is the best . If your on the fence to try it or not, give it a chance you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the live entertainment. The rolled quesadilla is huge! The salsa that comes with the free chips is amazing! My husband went through 4 cups of it! I went on a Friday night at 730. There was about a 30 minute wait and it was very crowded. We couldn't really see the band from our table but the music was still enjoyable. Our server seemed busy. The manager had to take our drink order. Although I would have liked better service and a better view I still had a good time and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit tucked in to the neighborhood in which it sits. So much larger on the inside and the place was really cool inside. We were seated and the host and the waitstaff were very accommodating and friendly, giving recommendations and good conversation, as it was our first time here. My aunt and son went with a rolled quesadilla thing and they were not disappointed! Tasty and plentiful! I had a smothered burrito, and I was so pleasantly surprised, the meat was tender and even though it looked huge when it arrived, it was a good portion.  When in this area again, we will return!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I so happened to stumble upon this place amongst Grand Avenue and residential homes. The parking lot was so full and the streets were crowded, but we are young so we decided to do the Arizona thing and romp in the dirt to park.  We arrived with friendly faces, the bartender was a lovely lady with a great sense of humor and good taste for margaritas! Our server was excellent and was a great conversationalist without being up in our faces. The restaurant was crowded with blue haired couples on the night out in the town with margaritas and smiles on their faces.   We ordered too much food, but glad we did so we could have left overs. The margaritas were yummy and they hit the spot. You have a choice of small, medium, and large...I say go with the large!   We ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was good, but I probably won't order it again. Then we had the posole (pozole) which was to die for! They make it with beef...which I am not use to but...wow..what a great soup. I am a menudo fan so for those of you who cannot stomach menudo (pun intended) then try their posole. Plus, the soup comes with tortillas that are homemade and they are the best tortillas that I have had in Arizona!! My great-aunt might have to do a tortilla off with this place!   Then we topped our meal with enchiladas del mar with imitation crab meat. It was tasteful, but I think I will come again and try something else. In the end we loved the service, the mariachi band, and the food and drinks are not stained with chain restaurant after taste but seemed to be made from the heart."}
{"text":"First time ever going to this place,  have drove past it thousands of times over the years.  Must say that it is a shame it took this long to find.   Very good food and large portions make it that much better. Will definitely be a regular place to go.  Service was also good"}
{"text":"A true mexican delight. We go here most of the time, when closed we head out to the sister location. Rio Mirage is the go to destination to bring visitors, large groups of friends and just lunch or dinner with family and the friends who first introduced me to the yummiest ever traditional mexican food. This is a must try for a special occasion or a Prickly pear margarita and lunch, or just because your hungry, The wait staff is attentive, warm and friendly, the restrooms extremely clean as is the rest of the restaurant. Sunday brunch is fantastic, I always enjoy trying dishes here that I may not have tried elsewhere. Never have I been dissatisfied. The portions are huge and  the Flan is amazing. When closed we head out to Surprise location and enjoy everything equally as much."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. We had a very nice dinner on the patio (minus the mosquitos) and our service was fantastic. The manager made rounds that seemed timely and appropriate...while our server was very attentive and went above and beyond. The food was great too! Seemed very fresh!!!"}
{"text":"LOVED the food at this place.  No doubt I'll make a trip back when I'm in town again.  Bonus points for having a habanero salsa option, too."}
{"text":"Great food, authentic atmosphere, friendly staff: this place has it all. Probably about 12 different margaritas varieties, I simply cannot express how much i enjoyed this restaurant. We just moved here from California (My gf and I) and I have found my new Mexican place! ;-)"}
{"text":"Valentines day 2011. Bad service, bad food, Place has really gone down  hill since our last visit."}
{"text":"Great food and very authentic. Service was good and quick.  Ask for the hot sauce but beware it has a little kick to it."}
{"text":"My first impression was this is Mexican restaurant for non-Mexicans in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood but regardless, the food was amazing all around our table.  Don't miss the homemade tortillas.  Mild spicing."}
{"text":"No draft beer or even any beer for a froday!!! You can't get a burro enchilada stable either. Poor service also!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  This was the third time this season we ate there. Not sure why we returned as we encountered many problems.  On one occasion one of our group did not touch his entree after tasting. To their credit they took it off the bill. Other diners that night had just barely ok fare.  On second occasion we were told a vegetarian request could not \"be made tonight as it was too busy\".  This waiter continued to be downright rude several times! Just tonight (three strikes and you are out) I ordered the fajita taco salad and it arrived with cool steak not even warm. Had to send it back. On second attempt meat was hot if not good quality, shell was cold and not crisp and overall not good. The usually very tasty salsa seemed like overripe tomatoes dominated  very very disappointing.  It was Monday night and margaritas are only a dollar. First one was ok--half ice but as expected, second 3/4 ice and when tried from the straw was very salty.  Now I know it was salted on rocks but this was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Below average food. Was served cold tamales. They reheated it and served it again. Should have made a whole new order. Rice was hard & crispy. Seemed left over from previous day."}
{"text":"This restaurant struck us all as a solid 4 star establishment.  The four adults had different dishes from a combination plate to the burrito de fajita to different dinner plates.  Each was very good and all came with the rice and beans.  We pretty much give thumbs up or down based on the rice and beans and these were some of the best any of us have sampled and we all hail originally from CA where they flow freely.    The manager runs a taught ship and the service reflects his hand.  Everyone is very professional providing just the right amount of attention.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice, homey and comfortable.  We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I so wanted to love this place. I grew up in Cali where I've had great Mexican food and after reading these reviews we wanted to take my mother out for a great Mexican  dinner while we were here visiting.  We tried 4 different dishes and they were so mediocre.  I kept trying every one else's thinking it was just mine, I had the spicy shrimp dish.  Not so much.  My mom had the chimichanga which was ok but everything else was meh...  If it was just decent I may go back and I understand every place has an off night but this was so far off I don't know if we will go back.  On the plus side and the reason for 2 stars is the service was very good and extremely friendly."}
