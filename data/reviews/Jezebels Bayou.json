{"text":"I grew up in Louisiana, so I'm picky about Cajun food. Jezebels absolutely delivers. The food was excellent - the fried green tomatoes were the best I've had, the shrimp creole was pretty good, the seafood étouffée was to die for, and the red beans and rice was spot on. They also had some jalapeno cornbread muffins which were good, and only slightly spicy. Service was very good, and fairly quick. They even have Abita Amber available. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"LOVED our first visit to Jezebel's Bayou! We had reservations on a Saturday night. Arrived, seated right away, and asked to be reseated because it was freezing underneath the overhead windows. We were promptly moved and the manager turned up the heat, which was really nice. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and provided such great recommendations and service. I had the blackened salmon and my husband had the seafood etoufee. Both were wonderful! The jalapeno cornbread muffins are adorable and delicious. We didn't order any fancy drinks, but the beer and wine we ordered was very generous in terms of size. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the appetizer we got, which was the catfish bites. The texture was nice but the taste was pretty bland (then again, it's catfish, so not the most flavorful to begin with). In terms of ambiance, this place has certainly got a NOLA feel, but not over the top. Definitely going to return to Jezebel's!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was rather average quality, actually.  Our server was inattentive at times, and kept forgetting things we asked for.  Maybe was there on an off-night--lots of other good reviews."}
{"text":"Jezebel's Bayou is a really cool place! The staff was friendly and the decor was really cool. I had the Alligator Voodoo and the Jambalaya. I haven't had alligator in twenty years and it was as good as I remember. The Jambalaya was also very good and had just the right amount of spice. I will be making another trip to this place soon."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and staff were all great. We really enjoyed our visit. It was perfect for a date night. The honey mustard sauce that comes with crab cakes was so good I wanted to eat it on everything. The crab cakes were also delicious. And the blackberry cobbler was amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Excellent portion for the price and a majority of our party of 15 seemed pleased with their meals. I had the paella served at the right temperature and with plenty of large shrimp, chicken and mussels. I didn't see a bunch of crawfish but it was still an extremely good value. I normally clean my plate but I had to get a to go box.  My wife got the salmon and absolutely devoured it.  Add in the complimentary valet parking, surprisingly low dinner check and chill atmosphere, I can definitely say that we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"We went to Jezebel's on a Sunday afternoon in August. Three sisters out to celebrate one sister's birthday. The decor is simple and really pretty, we took pictures of the New Orleans masks they were so gorgeous, we never take pix of decor. The restaurant was 3/4 full. The staff was VERY friendly, the owner came over and shared the story behind his place and he is clearly proud of it.  The food was really good, having been to New Orleans many times I found it very authentic. I was disappointed that they were out of Jambalaya, since this is a staple I think I might have been at the store at 6:00 AM to pick up the supplies but we found other things to have. The salads were healthy and full of several types of lettuce which isn't always the case in Nawlins.We shared the mac and cheese which was delicious so creamy and thick! The alligator appetizer and fried green tomatoes didn't disappoint. I've had alligator that was greasy but this was perfect. I had the grilled chicken breasts with beans and rice, very good and so much I had the other half for lunch the next day. The service was a bit slow but we weren't going anywhere and it was so friendly. If I were in a time crunch I would definitely mention it to the wait staff. As we were leaving the owner came out and said goodbye. Wow! It's been a long time since someone cared that much about their customers. I will definitely be back, there's so much more to try!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe that this restaurant could be out of their featured special by 6 PM on a Saturday night!   Boy does that say a lot!  And they don't know how to make the native New Orleans drink called the sazarac.  Ours was pretty nasty.  On the plus side the waitress and the staff were very friendly.  But be sure to look at your bill before you leave. There were four of us and we split or four entrées amongst us. However the waitress billed us for five entrées. Shame on us for not looking at the bill more closely when we split the checks up.  However, the manager has not refunded us the cost of the extra dinner despite at least three of our requests.  He agreed to credit our credit card but has failed to do so after two months.  I guess we're stuck but we will never go back."}
{"text":"Once again I read reviews on here and decided to go and give this restaurant a try and I was sooooo excited. I am such a geechee woman and I loved me some good ole' creole food. I went expecting the Cajun food to take me away and I was taken away alright, because I wanted them to take my food straight to the garbage. Ok so maybe I started this review off wrong, but definitely with great reason. So let me tell you all how my Mother's Day Brunch here was all kinds of awful. I should have known when I saw women with big hats leaving this place and it was only 1pm .  Walking through the door we were half greeted by a server and he advised us that because it was Mother's day the half of the room to the right was reserved by people who made reservations and the half by the door was available to sit at. This was perfectly okay with me, because I had already commented to the my cousin that I didn't want to sit on that half of the room because it looked so crowded and cramped, so this was news to my ears.  When the server took us to our seats he sat us and din't provide us with any menus and we didn't get any for a good 15 minutes!!! Due to wanting a ZEN kind of day we tried not to stress out and make a fuss, we had already figured before we left home and made plans to come here that because it was Mother's Day that where ever we went there would be a crowd, so we more than willing to deal with the hustle.   After we finally received our menus the server came about 20 minutes later.......to take our order. By this time I was starving and reading all the good stuff on the menu had my mouth watering. But that's all I got was a eyegasm because the food was terrible. I ordered the alligator bites and I have had plenty of creole and cajun food over my life span but this was not it. The alligator was tough and bland and had all this cajun seasoning on top. Cajun food does not mean that it has to be drowned with cajun seasoning you can buy in the seasoning aisle at the grocery store. I thought maybe  it was just the alligator so I asked the waiter if I could send it back and he offered me to order something else on the menu, so I ordered the fried green tomatoes. My cousin suggested I get it because she knows I love me some fried green tomatoes. Keep in mind that at this point we still hadn't ordered a drink, because the waiter ran off yet againnnnnn and we didn't see him for another 15 minutes. I was beyond starving at this point so when I got the fried green tomatoes I dove in and just about choked. They were disgusting. I have never had such horrible food. They were once again smothered with that same heavy seasoning and just bland. I thought maybe my taste buds were off so I asked my cousin to try them and I say this to say that she is a licensed and trained chef and she spit them out just as quickly as she put them in her mouth.  She had ordered wings for her appetizer and let me try one of hers and they weren't bad. We waited for our entrees and the server finally came and took our drink orders, but it took another 20 minutes before we got it. The place wasn't that jam packed but the issue was that there were 4 servers and a slew of kitchen staff and our server was working the door, serving, bartending, and answering phones.smh. I mean they didn't know to prepare for Mother's Day and then on top of that they were very attentive to the customers with reservation but not to us or the 1 other couple there. Another couple came in and after waiting to get service for 30 minutes they leftl! We were still trying to be ZEN so we stuck it out. The drinks were strong and good. I ordered a hurricane and it definitely put me at ease until the entrees came out. I ordered the Shrimp po' boy and fries which was simple enough and my cousin had the catfish w/ spinach and mashed potatoes. Everything looked amazing, but looks are definitely deceiving and I spoke way too soon, because it all tasted terrible. BLAND with that same seasoning. We politely waited for the server to come check on us for 35 minutes and I know because I checked my phone and requested to send all the food back. I told him I wasn't happy with he meal or service at all and would pay for the fries which I half ate due to hunger and the alcoholic drink. He asked my question if she liked her food, which he should have known she didn't because our food looked about the same as when he brought it out.   To make matters worse, we heard the 1 couple behind us complaining to one another that there food wasn't good. I was glad to know it wasn't just us.It took another 30 minutes and with the kitchen staff staring us down for him to bring us our checks. I was soooo excited to dine here and had even bookmarked this place to try and everything from the service to the food was lackluster and left a bad taste in my mouth. I've never had to walk out of a restaurant until I came here. FYI if your going to have rsvp's and still keep the restaurant open treat all your guests equal."}
{"text":"Not a fan, crummy service. Everything was heavily doused in the same spicy Cajun seasoning. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Considering the other reviews, it sounds like coming here is like playing the lottery. And if gambling was what we did, we certainly won. (The 4-star instead of 5-star rating has to do with the crowd--there were a few really rude patrons here while we were and it seemed like this was a regular occurrence. Patrons create atmosphere as much as decor, music, and service do.)  A friend and I split the catfish entree and shrimp po'boy (with red beans instead of fries). Both meals were amazing. The fish was tender and basically just melted away, the potatoes were fluffy and tasty, the po'boy was a good ratio of sandwich parts to bread (my biggest fear is too much bread), and the only thing I wasn't wowed by were the beans! I'd say that's a great outcome during what sounded like what COULD have been a flop of a dinner. I would certainly come back and eat this entire meal again. Even the drinks were good! I had a strawberry gin mojito, which was fantastic and I'm super wary of gin (and I can't remember what my friend had, but she was happy and it was fruity and delicious).   The only weird thing that happened had to do with other diners---err, drinkers. There was a couple at the bar and they sent a message to us through our server that we'll never find men if we keep sitting alone at a table together. A little strange, as my friend and I were clearly having a wonderful time together, laughing and enjoying our dinner. We weren't shooting lonely looks around the dining room...and I'm married.  I guess the moral of the story is that people are weird and make strange assumptions and the food here is tasty!"}
{"text":"Best Cajun ever! Try the alligator app."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, the first time my experience was wonderful, the second time I came back with 2 additional people and the experience was even better, if thats even possible! We had a server named Camille, both times, that made recommendations that were all spectacular. I have to admit, the server was a huge part of the amazing dining experience each time. She has a great attitude, is full of life and genuinely good a what she does, definitely an asset to the company. I have had the chicken etouffee, the redfish po'boy (and I am not a big fish person), and several desserts (including a bread pudding with bourbon--yumm!)- all out of this world!! The fried green tomatoes have a great cajun spice added to them, complemented by a delicious sauce. The only thing I didn't fully enjoy were the beignets- not because they weren't good, simply because I was expecting them to be small and light, as opposed to big and doughy squares.They also do a great job of making things extra spicy if you ask them to! This is the place to go for great service, delicious new orleans- style food and gorgeous atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times my favorite item was the jalapeno corn bread. It's the perfect amount of jalapeno mixed with the sweetness of the cornbread. Could not be more perfect.   I ordered the seafood etouffee and was very pleasantly surprised. There was so much seafood in the dish and everything was soooo wonderfully flavored. My only qualm was that it was a little too spicy for my taste. Everyone else at my table who ordered the dish loved it though!  Both times I was here, I came with a large group of friends. I was scared about the splitting of the bill because it always gets to be a hassle for us and the restaurant. The waitress was incredibly nice and took 7-8 credit cards and swiped them all for various amounts. It was such an easy transaction.   Thumbs up for the great experience and the delicious food."}
{"text":"In all fairness, the food was on par--not extraordinary, but on par. The four of us enjoyed appetizers of calamari, (on which we loved the wasabi sauce), and crab cakes, (which had an awesome sauce that was--unfortunately--too sparingly provided); then, we had the lobster mac n cheese (can't go wrong there), the blackened Louisiana catfish (a little dry around the edges, but great overall), BBQ shrimp, and jambalaya. Again, great food. However, the service was not. We had to ask four times for the biscuits that come standard with dinners, our server had no idea what wines or beers were on the menu/in the house (My fiancé ordered two before he was successful and able to have a drink), and our table vigorously wobbled until we asked to have it fixed. Point: at $18 for your average dinner (add in drinks and apps and you're at $30), higher expectations need to be met. Our leftover food should have been packaged for us, our server should have known what drinks were in the house, and the bathrooms should not be dirty and out of toilet paper. Your money will get you further elsewhere. My advice? Order the delicious food to go, and save yourself the tax and tip."}
{"text":"We came here during the Larchmere Porchfest. The food is decent but the red plastic cups and plastic ware is the epitome of tackiness. What looks to be an upscale Cajun restaurant turns out to be more like a fast food restaurant. Their bar also couldn't make a traditional martini. We were told they weren't making \"fancy\" drinks today. My glass of wine was served in a lovely red plastic cup. Tacky!  Their excuse is that this is what they do during the festival. Their prices, however, still are more akin to an upscale restaurant notwithstanding the tacky plastic ware and cups."}
{"text":"I was originally waiting for a table at Zanzibar, but the hostess told us to check out this restaurant around the corner because it was less crowed (lol), and we took her advice and never looked back :)   My first impression of Jezebels was that it gave off a very homey yet festive vibe, with Mardi Gras decorations displayed on the walls and dimly lit candles around the restaurant. I felt as if I were in New Orleans!   Rather than the ever so mundane bread and butter at every other restaurant, Jezebels started us off with some amazing mini jalapeño corn bread. HOLY COW, these were just PERFECT! For appetizer, I ordered the herb chicken wings. I loved this dish! The wings were so crispy and the tangy flavor simply sealed the deal. For my entree, I ordered the jambalaya. It was my first time trying jambalaya, and I'm so glad that I did it at Jezebels :)   I seriously have no complaints about this restaurant, and I can't wait to come back to try their other items!"}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday Friday night. Love that they take reservations. We started with hurricanes, which were super strong & quite tasty. I had never tried catfish, & the pecan crusted catfish bites were amazing. We also tried alligator which was good but not my thing. For dinner, I had the crab cakes as my entree. Three perfectly done pillows. The waitress asked if I also wanted a salad, which was also really good, but it was an entree salad, not a side salad. If I had realized that, I would have said no, but not a huge deal. They also messed up a friend's order, but corrected it as soon as they realized. The beignets & coffee were also a nice end to a great meal with friends. The checks were a little off, but again, not a big deal & we were a party of 6. We ate & drank a lot, the bill wasn't cheap, but all in all a good experience, fun for special nights out."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I have never been to NOLA. So I suppose I've never had truly authentic Cajun/Creole cuisine, NOLA style. BUT damn. I really hope that this was it because it was SO good!   Fake boyfriend and I went last night and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meal.   We started off with a beer and a cocktail. I tried the Cajun Lemonade. Very interesting (with hot sauce!) and refreshing -- I'd definitely drink that again.   For an appetizer we chose the pecan-crusted catfish -- delicious and you could tell that the fish was super fresh. We also got a Caesar salad because FB likes to try them almost everywhere. It was good.   Entree was the Classic Cajun etouffee. WOW. The flavor of that dish was simply incredible. It included country shrimp, crawfish, and redfish \"seasoned w/ Creole spices and vegetables then smothered in a rich crab stock with red-brown roux and served over steamed rice.\" I typed that out and a little bit of drool fell onto my keyboard. I can't recommend this dish enough.   I really wanted to try a po' boy but I just didn't enough room in my stomach. Next time, for sure!   Service was really great. Our server, Jake, took care of us splendidly.   Only negatives were:  it was really loud inside, even though it wasn't overly crowded. Bad acoustics, I think. However, the dining room had cozy lighting and overall nice ambiance.   We opted to sit outside on their street front patio. It was nice and they pipe music out there. Plus, you can sit and watch all of the yupsters who are out walking their dogs.   LOVE Jezebel's. Can't wait to get my happy ass back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We had a party of four, and we all ordered different dishes.  Everyone raved about their orders.  These folks know how to cook!!!  A real cut above."}
{"text":"Not happy at all. Food very bland. Service not happy. Server was nice. But I can't see myself returning."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this restaurant and I was apprehensive due to all the mixed reviews. However I was pleasantly surprised. I went on a Wednesday evening for happy hour and there were only 3 other patrons present. The atmosphere was inviting, the waiter was very attentive, and the drinks and food were fabulous. I do plan on returning very soon."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  We were the only table there.  Hostess/waitress was nice but took 15 minutes to bring drinks. Stuffed mushroom appetizer took 20 minutes, only to discover a BIG HAIR ON THE PLATE. Couple this with the kitchen staff and cleaning staff yelling and cussing at each other made for good reason to leave and not want to go back. No manager seemed present and nobody seemed to care. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We came here today (on Mardi Gras) with no reservation, and the owner/manager went way out of his way to open up a table for us.  As busy as it was the server was prompt, very friendly, and very knowledgeable about the food items.  They had a shortened menu for the holiday but we were blown away by their cajun rub wings for starters and the Po Boys (we got the fried catfish and the blackened catfish).  Had a great time and definitely hope to go back to try the jambalaya (they had a vegan version as well) and the seafood etouffee.  Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a fun evening with some great food and great service."}
{"text":"The Etoufee and Lobster Mac were good but the portions were tiny for the price. Could have been four stars easily if the portion was larger and recieved more than one small piece of lobster."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of food from \"The Big Easy\". My last visit was during Happy hour and everything that I sampled was nothing short of  stellar!  The catfish was light, crispy and just like grandma used to make. The Étouffée was a reason to come back in itself; perfectly draped over a bed of fluffy rice, this spicy dish is even mild enough for the faint of heart. The happy hour hurricane from the bar was crazy strong and made me wonder how they could afford serve them. Over all, I will definitely make sure Jezebel's is on my monthly rotation."}
{"text":"Authentic New Orleans cuisine. I had the blackened red fish and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned right. Also had a few appetizers - gator bites and mussels. Both were spot on!  My wife had a pork chop and beans and rice and they also were on the money. We sat outside on the sidewalk and enjoyed the scenery. It was a busy night at the restaurant. The service was a little off, but nothing that really impacted the evening.  Definitely recommended.  Cleveland food scene keeps going up!"}
{"text":"Very nice experience for first visit. We went on a Sat evening with reservations and were seated promptly. Small, cozy but open environment. For meal I got the sampler which was excellent and for apps the Oysters Rockefeller and a pecan crusted catfish. Both were very good. Bathroom fairly clean but not great. Our server was very nice but didn't know a great deal about the foods on the menu. The only negative was that service was pretty slow and i waited a long time for a refill on beverage."}
{"text":"This has been a very pleasant discovery. Jezebels Bayou offers fair priced, good portioned, flavorful New Orleans food with good atmosphere and very friendly staff.    DECOR: This is a newly opened restaurant.  The decor is trendy and modern with jazz at the background.  FOOD: Tried the Calamari, Jambalaya, seafood Paella, Fried catfish platter.  None of which disappoint. They also have these small Jelapano cornbread, which are difficult to stop eating.  Had a very good dinner.  They also give a personal touch where the Chef, the Manager all came by the table to shake your hand and inquire about your experience.  Will definitely come back and try the rest of the menu.  On a side note, they also have a happy hour, where they offer discounted drinks and smaller portioned dishes."}
{"text":"Not enjoyable at all. I should've sent my food back to the kitchen. The seafood étouffée was bland and watery. I ordered crab stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and received 4 small ones that weren't delicious for $10. The service was atrocious; my group was rarely checked on and it took 45 minutes to receive the check.  The management here needs to do better with improving the food as well as service. The servers are extremely slow and inattentive. Recipe for a short-lived establishment. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Rude staff at Felice down the street chased our group out at one cocktail and luckily we found Jezebel's. MUCH better choice! Don't even bother with Felice."}
{"text":"Just the scent of the SAZERAC took us right back to NOLA, and the taste... well it was spot on! We loved our dinner at Jezabel's and will definitely return very soon. I had the SWEET & CRUNCHY PRALINE SALAD and ate every single bite. The combination of the flavors in the salad were absolutely delicious! My boyfriend had the Seafood Paella and enjoyed every bit of it. For dessert we shared Beignets and the Bread Pudding, both of which were scrumptious. To finish off the evening, an authentic cup of Café du Monde coffee was the perfect end to a great experience."}
{"text":"Oh man, I loved this place. Going here was on the recommendation of a friend, because I live in Lakewood and can barely be bothered to figure out the baffling labyrinth of (most of) the East Side. But this Larchmere neighborhood is cute, and if the other restaurants around here are anything like Jezebel's, I'll be back.   Now, I was in New Orleans once for, like, 14 hours. So my main food memories of that time include drinking too many hurricanes and eating hot dogs from a street vendor in the chintzy tourist area known as Bourbon Street. But I will say that I haven't had a fried shrimp po' boy this good in a real long time.   My friends got jambalaya and etouffee, which both looked and smelled delicious. The bill was surprisingly reasonable, especially because the portions of food were crazy huge compared to what you'll get other places. This isn't a fancy-grilled-carrots-for-nine-dollars type of place. Service was fast and friendly, and their patio was nice for chilling outside on a gorgeous late-summer night."}
{"text":"This was a dining experience! The decor is friendly and comfy. Our waiter made us feel welcomed and made great suggestions. Between the four of us we had jambalaya, pastalaya, king crab, and blackened  catfish. Everything was delicious including the alligator voodoo and crab stuffed mushroom caps. This is a must go to restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I've watched too many cooking shows but I didn't expect to get a decent vegan meal in a Cajun inspired restaurant. But I was totally wrong.   My fiance and I stopped in on a whim after going to happy hour elsewhere. I looked up Jezebel's Bayou's menu online and when I saw there was a vegetarian section, I figured we might as well give it a try.  We were seated immediately. The restaurant was about half full on a Friday night. It looked like there were a lot of large, loud parties everywhere. Not saying that's a bad thing. I suppose the spirit of New Orleans calls for a spirited vibe.  To start, I ordered a hurricane. I should know better than to order a drink with 151, but whatevs. It was very alcohol-y. They had a very large menu with a ton of specialty drinks. I probably should have ordered something more my speed.  For dinner, I ordered vegan jambalaya. Yes, there was a vegan item on the menu and I didn't even have to ask for anything special. Score! And it was some damn good jambalaya. I've attempted to make jambalaya myself but I can't seem to get the flavors right. But this dish? SO good. Lots of rice dishes in restaurants are merely ok, but this one was packed with Cajun flavors.   I also have to note that our server Camille was attentive without being overbearing, friendly, and funny! She really made our meal seem special. If I had a restaurant, I'd want a staff of servers like her - people who know their stuff and have a really friendly attitude.   This place is definitely worth checking out if you like Cajun food or just want to try something new. Especially if you're a vegan or a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is quite nice.  We felt a little underdressed though.  The service was great until a huge party came in.  The drinks were good, I got a peach house wine, it was amazing!  We even went out on a limb and tried alligator.  It was good, just weird.  Our meals were very good.  I got a po' boy and my husband got the catfish platter.  Good flavor and quality."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night. And good thing; we made reservations. It wasn't too busy at first, but it definitely picked up later!  Our server was very nice and we actually were recommended the hurricanes. And let me tell you; they do not disappoint.  For our app we got the jumbo crab cakes. I must say I was kind of disappointed because I was expected really big crab cakes. And they came out and were bite sized. They did pack a jumbo flavor though.   For our entrees we got the jambalaya and the BBQ shrimp and mashed potatoes. Both of them were delicious and not too spicy. Which was nice.   For dessert we got the beneits and the mixed berry cobbler. The beneits did take a little bit to come out but they were FRESH.   All in all it was a great experience. And the nice part is; they have complimentary valet. We did not use bc there was super close street parking. I definitely would go back and try something else; or potentially sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Stopped by here late this evening for a light meal after attending a function. Started with gumbo. It was nice and flavorful. Full of sausage and chicken. The catfish was excellent. It was fried crisp and was not greasy or to hard. It was served with a nice sauce. Finished the evening with a nice warm cup of coffee that was rich and flavorful. The service was good. Meals were brought out quickly."}
{"text":"We just stopped in tonight on a whim and had a wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere at Jezebels was so comfortable, the music set the mood. It was quiet, but appealing jazz that didn't overwhelm. The tables weren't crammed together so you could feel confident that your conversations would be kept private. The staff was attentive but not intrusive.  I had the CHICKEN ÉTOUFFÉE over rice. It was a delight to eat. My wife had the blacken redfish po'boy with fries. There was so much she took half of it home.  I'd recommend this place in an instant. It's always nice to find good place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour...5-7. Definitely a worthwhile menu...$5 plates and $5 drinks. We all split wings, jambalaya, catfish bites and the chicken etouffee. Wings and catfish were delicious. Rice dishes were good(not amazing) as well..jambalaya better than etoufee which was not spicy enough for my taste. Service was great. We also got dessert...beignets were surprisingly delicious (even tho they were no cafe du monde). The bread pudding was just okay...too dense. Have definitely had much better bread pudding in Cleveland.  The regular menu looks delicious however...esp some of the seafood dishes! Will be back for both hh and regular menu!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Jezebel's and I must say... I'm glad I did! I'll definitely be coming back to this place. I've never been to New Orleans, so I can't personally speak to the authenticity, but everything we had was delicious, stick to your ribs creole soul food! Fried Green Tomatoes: Great! Good flavor, crispy but light batter, and the spicy sauce was delicious. Alligator Voodoo: Worth a try. I'd never had gator before. It kind of tastes like chicken, but it's tougher, kind of like calamari. For obvious reasons, it's a bit pricey though. You don't get very much for $10. I'm glad I tried it, but probably won't get it again.  For my entree, I ordered the shrimp, crawfish, and redfish etouffee. I CANNOT say enough about this dish. It was very delicious. Spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. All the seafood was cooked to perfection. The roue was delicious.   I also tasted the jambalaya and the paella. Both were excellent.  The service was also very good.   I only gave 4 stars for 2 reasons: 1. The dessert was just so-so. I tried the bread pudding, which was very dense, although it had a good flavor, and the beignets, which were also fine, but denser than I'd like them. 2. The ambiance is more casual than the food. You feel like you're in a mardi gras themed TGI Fridays (with fewer decorations). Compared to the personality of other restaurants in the area, they would do well to spruce it up inside.   Overall, fantastic food, and I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great environment and the food's pretty good.  I recommend the fried green tomatoes, and seafood etouffee."}
{"text":"I went to Jezebels with a very large group of ladies last night (18 people).  The food was excellent., and our server, Jake, did a decent job.  I had the jambalaya (of which they offer a vegan version), a glass of the Lohr Chardonnay, and the praline cheesecake.  The jambalaya was spiced perfectly.  The Chardonnay, while one of the more expensive pours, perfectly balanced the flavors in my entree.  I thank Jake for the excellent recommendation.    As to the service:  we were missing a few place settings, some ladies didn't get water right away, and our food was very slow to come out.  We began to arrive at 7pm and I think that the main course came out around 8:15pm or so and the time on my check is 9:56pm.   Now, considering we were a large group, we weren't in much of a rush.  We were there to socialize.  However, had I realized that it would take over an hour to get our main course, I would've ordered an appetizer or a salad.  I strongly suspect that we would've had a superior experience if our group wasn't so large.  I saw other tables around us that were being served very quickly.  So, while the service wasn't quick owing to the size of our group, the food and atmosphere are worth a trip.  Also, the prices are very reasonable, and we received complimentary valet parking.  So, I say GO - just stick to a smaller group of people...or if you are taking a large group, perhaps don't go on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here on Christmas Eve because there weren't many options and this place came recommended by other friends. I was pleasantly surprised. We shared the vegan jambalaya and lobster mac and cheese. The jambalaya was delicious. Lots of veggies on well seasoned rice. The lobster mac and cheese was very cheesy, and I was so glad we were sharing because there's no way I could have eaten it as an entree myself. It's pretty heavy as a standalone entree. I think my favorite part of the meal may have been the cornbread muffins that come with dinner. I loved the jalapeño pepper kicker."}
{"text":"If the service here had been as good as the food, I would be giving them five stars and would definitely go back.   Everything we ate was fantastic. My husband and I ordered the calamari appetizer which was crispy and delicious. Our table mates had the alligator and it was so yummy and unique! Our cocktails were all delicious as well. Between the four of us, we ended up ordering two plates of étouffée and two plates of paella. We all devoured them. Everything was perfectly spiced and seasoned.   Unfortunately, we had to sit almost ten minutes before we were even greeted, received our cocktails waaaayyyy after our appetizers arrived, and waited a long time for everything. We were one of only four seated tables so it's not like they were overwhelmed.   I may go back, if it's someone else's idea, but there's a LOT of restaurants who do better that are closer to my house. Oh, and management? If you're reading this, do something about your music selection. The 50's pop hits would be cute if you were a burger shack, but if you're portraying New Orleans, how about some bluesy jazz instead?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice and cozy. The food was good but I definitely want to try something else. My friend and i went on a sunday for brunch it was empty which was nice we were served fast and the waitor was a nice guy. My favorite where the crab cakes they were Delicious. Overall a nice restaurant.I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"New Orleans may be my favorite place on Earth, so anywhere I can have a good NOLA-inspired meal is already up there on my list.  Seriously though, Jezebel's is a great place for po-boys, jambalaya, gumbo and all your other Creole favorites.   The service is always great and the atmosphere is always lively.  The drinks here are great,too.  They make a great Sazerac (my favorite) and if you like spicy, try the Cajun Lemonade.  If you are feeling brave, try the alligator bites - flavorful and interesting."}
{"text":"Went for a happy hour... What a neat place.  Happy hour until 7pm.  4 beer, 5 wine and apps...had the blacked and fried catfish bites which were very good , the chicken wings were so yummy...my favorite.  Primarily African American afterwork crowd who were friendly and very chatty.  Would definately go again"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to trying out this restaurant.  We were in the mood for some creole food.  Too bad what we got was not authentic creole. It was like fast food creole, at best.   Although the server was very nice, that didnt make up for the very poor quality food.  The jambalaya that my husband ordered was missing most of the meat (no sausage and just a few TINY pieces of chicken) but mainly was a dry rice dish.  Very disappointing.  The P-Boy alligator sandwich was terrible.  VERY chewy alligator that had light breading falling off of it.  I didnt each more than 2 bites of the sandwich.  The fries that came with this dish were soggy.  Although the server saw that I didnt eat my alligator dish and I told her that I didnt like it at all, she didnt take it off of our bill or notify a manager (if one was even there).  The place was mainly empty on a Saturday night. That should have been our sign to turn around and find another place.  We will not be returning..."}
{"text":"My friend and I were deciding as to whether or not to come in; and the hostess came outside and welcomed us in.  Good form!        We were there for happy hour during which they have $5 plates.  I got the jambalaya and pecan crushed catfish.  Both were very nice.        My friend got the chicken etouffee and friend green tomatoes.  The seasoning on his tomatoes were a little too much and more Italian then southern.        The cooks know how to cook their proteins very well.  Chicken was moist and so was the catfish.  They need a little work on plating.  I would have liked the edges of my plates wiped.        If you like sweet tea.  This is the place to go!"}
