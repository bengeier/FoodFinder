{"text":"I just had two Michigan's & coke at Sandy's Deli. The staff welcomed me cheerfully as they did for the next six customers that came in as I sat there eating. The hot dogs were very good, and the sauce on top had the authentic flavor I've always enjoyed. They have a wide variety of food available listed on a wide chalkboard above the counter, and in their menu. All the locals eat here and I recommend it for lunch."}
{"text":"I've had their egg salad sandwich and potato salad a few times. No problems with it.  Not a bad place to go for lunch. My friend had the fried chicken combo with fries. It was rather too oily and could be much better. I've never tried their pizza's yet. Place is clean and has a large selection of choices of what to eat. I often see people there eating, so it must be good enough to go."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place in town to order from. Now for my last 3 orders the food has been cold or gross or both. It was like they ran out of gravy for poutine and mixed it with water to make my fries. It was so wet it spilled all over my car through the paperbag. Thinking it was a fluke I have ordered twice in the last three months but my fries aren't cooked tonight and the last time the sub I got had so much dressing the bread fell apart and was mushy. The service used to be great too but my last two visits they've been distracted and rude. I didn't even complain about the food being poor because they seem frustrated they had to serve me in the first place."}
{"text":"I went here twice in a week because of the lure of poutine...which is why I'm not gonna be able to keep this weight off for long...anyway.  Round one: interesting counter service, ok attitude, pretty good poutine. Fries were nice and crisp, gravy was warm...curds did not melt. Eh...off day?  Round two: again with the quiet service, fries crisp, curds still not melty...and what is this strange crunchy thing in my poutine??? Not a french fry. Felt like an egg shell, or a small bone. Not sure...but until I can forget about it, I probably won't return."}
