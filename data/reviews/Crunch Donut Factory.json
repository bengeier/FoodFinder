{"text":"The service was pretty good. He was very friendly. He didn't have every donut, but said if we wanted a donut that wasn't there he would make it, and he did. I am NOT a donut person. I'm still not. These donuts aren't that good. My friends hyped it up. Maybe if you're a donut person you'll like it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Open 24 hours is a HUGE PLUS. When I went, the owner was there to greet us and I wasn't sure that I could handle 6-12 donuts...but, these donuts are not overly sweet to where you feel sick if you give in to your donut cravings. I had the Whippi Goldberg, Heaven Bacon, M&Ms, Taylor Crunch one, peanut butter, Oreo, etc... all were equally good. 
So yes it's more like a yeast-cake donut which my refined palate prefers. They even stayed fresh for a few days in my house with no problem! This place is a better value than Pink Box for example, you get a lot more creativity. They are always adding new flavors so keep your eyes peeled."}
{"text":"Literally the best donuts I have ever had. My friend and I each got 2 donuts, and all of them were delicious. The Katy Cherry is so good. Can't wait to try the funnel cake next !"}
{"text":"Great variety of sweets including waffles and ice cream. Doughnuts were all great and the uniqueness was not lost either. All the doughnts tasted were great for their flavor and the toppings did not disappoint. Even at 11pm on a Thursday staff was friendly and genuinely seemed to care about the customer."}
{"text":"I got home from a long night of partying and I really wanted something sweet at 3AM. Lo and behold, this little shop was on uber eats and I was so pumped. I ordered the one with fruity pebbles on it, and that was okay, but I also ordered the one with cinnamon toast crunch on it and it was amazing. I also got one of the waffles that came with ice cream and it was soooo good. Would definitely order drunkingly here again."}
{"text":"Inside the store, it was bright, cheerful, and clean. The service was great; there was a very nice friendly lady behind the counter which made me wish I liked the donuts better.  The concept is a cute idea but the donuts themselves were disappointing. Even the plainest donuts were too sweet even by donut standards and unfortunately half of the donuts we had tasted stale."}
{"text":"This place has awesome donuts. For two reasons,
1. The dough although common to most grocery store types is still very good a homemade. 
2. The frosting and toppings are some of the best I've ever had. 
So far every donut has been amazing and the flavor combos go great together. Good job!"}
{"text":"Greaaat! Everything we needed in this area - great customer service , great atmosphere, and above all great donuts ! So happy they are here ! Try the Unicorn donut!  Try the Maple Bar! Oh and they are hilarious with the funny names of the donuts too ! Yipppeee!"}
{"text":"This must be one of the worst places I've ever been to. They charge you $2.49 for a dried up old donut that can wake the dead.  They have these cool celebrity names and nice design to it, but the quality is terrible.  There is no one walking into this place so they have no turnaround, so forget about freshness.  I'm more than sure their donuts are at least 48-72 hours old.  Never again."}
{"text":"The tine turtle iced coffee was watery and didn't even taste like a coffee. The gentleman working there was nice but had dirty fingernails and he had long hair that wasn't put up properly. The glaze donut was good."}
{"text":"Crunch donuts are the best. Katy Cherry is the bomb.com. I just wished Ubereats listed all of their donuts in the list for the dozen donuts. There's a few I haven't tried yet because of that."}
{"text":"Quality has gone SO FAR downhill. Donuts don't look or taste the same. Placed an order through uber eats at 8am for a dozen mixed donuts. All of our favorites from before were no longer the same. Donuts tasted stale and were very sloppy. We threw more than half of them in the trash. So many other options in the area that are far better taste and quality."}
{"text":"Their donuts are old and dry. I don't know if they make their own ice cream or where they get it from but it's the worst ice cream I have ever had. The waffle was the best part. It was good, but it looks weird like a wheat waffle. I asked if it was wheat and she said \"no, we are trying a new batter\"..."}
{"text":"Every city has an abundance of baked and fried delicacies.  LV is no different.  A bit off the beaten path, Uber or Lyft make getting here a breeze.  In addition to the smells that hit you once you enter, the names of each donut is listed on the wall.  Each unique with celebrity inspired names I couldn't decide so I did what any normal person would do.  Ordered one of each!

The flavors were each unique and satisfying. Peanut butter and jelly, oreo crumb and birthday cake were just a few of the flavors I tried.  Prices are quite reasonable, with discounts for orders of half and full dozen."}
{"text":"Great donuts.   Great service.  They guarantee all of their products.   Anyone with one star reviews on here did not bother to take them up on their guarantee and just came on here to bash them."}
{"text":"You need to go there not only to taste delicious donuts and out of this world donut burger, but also make stunning pictures of the limo outside and of the menu -- you'll be surprised at the names and will have a good laugh. My favorite one is the one with cherry (not telling you the name from the menu, just go and see for yourself). Reasonable pricing, a donut for a dollar...for real! 
The owner has a huge experience of working with pastry and desserts, and if you ask her and be persistent, she'll make you a personalized cake for your celebration or special occasion."}
{"text":"Love this place, super friendly staff, tasty donuts, and super cute names for them. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Donuts aren't good and are extremely over priced. The names are definitely better than the taste."}
{"text":"I don't live around here, I am visiting for the week. I needed a sweet did so I decided to check grub hub for options. I found Crunch and decided to go for it. They have the dozen of their premium flavors for $19.99. I selected *Ellen Doughgeneours 
* Kim KarDoughshian 
* Brad Fritter 
* Taylor Crisp 
* Samoas Hyack 
* Nutshell DoughBama 
* LeoNardo DiOreo 
* S'Morgan Freeman 
* Eminem 
* Christiano RonalDough 
* The \"Crunch\" 
* Marilyn MonDough. I received 2 Taylor crisp, 2 Samoa hayack, Leonardo dioreo, smorgan Freeman, Eminem, the crunch, nutshell doughbama, Cristiano ronaldough, Ellen doughgenerous, and the Marilyn mondough. Seriously? If some thing wasn't available I should have been called and given the choice to cancel my order or substitute. Second, they were all stale. Why???? Are they overproducing and they just sit out???? The Cristiano filling was sour, so they can't tell me any of these doughnuts are fresh. I also ordered a doughnut shake, the smorgan Freeman. Terrible. Why was it so watery? I paid a good amount which I DO NOT mind, I don't mind spending money on quality food that I am satisfied with. I was not satisfied with any part of this order. The cereal toppings, coconut, etc were hard and stale. I wish I could get my money back for this waste. DO NOT EAT HERE UNTIL THEY GET IT TOGETHER. The GrubHub driver was on time and courteous."}
{"text":"So I hate this place, because it's soooo good. UberEATS delivers to me in 20 minutes which sucks because I'm now considering ordering 3 more donuts for the second time today. I'm not even a big sweets and dessert person but wow. I'm a big fat fatty."}
{"text":"They have delicious and interesting donuts. I saw this hole in the wall while driving and craving for some donuts. This place did not disappoint. I got half a dozen of assorted donuts to go home with. My husband ate them all the moment i went home. Gonna come back to try some more of their donuts!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEES KNEES!!!!! 

So inlove with the doughnuts but the donut icecream sandwich is especially my favorite. I definitely have never experienced such deliciousness. I normally order a couple donuts but I always go home with an ice cream sandwich donut togo and stash it in the freezer for later. I have not tried any of the waffles yet. The milkshakes are good but can be a little too sweet. 
My favorite donuts are the Katy Cherry and the Cristiano Ronaldough. 
The Snoop doughgee dog and the samoa hyack are also great. 
The Vegas location is super cool because they have random, fun flavors asides from the standard menu. I am looking forward to trying the Margi-dough-ritga-ville sounds super good, infused with a bit of patron lime filling  :)
One thing I have not tried is to create my own donut... this place is so dangerous!
Viva Crunch Donut Factory!!!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to order a delivery ever since they published an ad. BUT!!!! They never answer their phone so you can not get a delivery. Does this place even exist?"}
{"text":"Love this place! The names are just part of what makes it fun. And each one I've tried, I've enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's Day at 7:30 am hoping to find some theme doughnuts for the occasion but they didn't. But it didn't matter cause these two are just perfect, also the service was great I was greeted as I came in, and the girl told me right away I'm making new doughnut right now so just take a look at the manu and tell me what  you want which was great cause the dounuts I ordered weren't  in the counter so I got so happy, cause I now I was gonna get fresh doughnuts and I did!"}
{"text":"these are probably close to the worst doughnuts i've ever had they are kind of stale not much flavor, the smore doughnut things had NO FILLING very disappointed, I would never eat here again everything is over priced even for las vegas. would've done negative 3 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Donuts weren't worth the price.  Waffles were terrible.  Staff didn't know how to make the waffles.  Ordered a waffle with strawberries and got about 6 pieces of a terrible strawberry on it.  Won't go back!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something sweet. I noticed that they had this on UberEats but I wanted to see what they had on hand and find out if they were made fresh. I did call in advance and asked if they were made fresh throughout the day. They had told me yes. Given that it is open 24/7 I wanted to see for myself. 
I came here with friends employee greeted us. As we looked at the menu I did notice that they also serve a donut burger. I thought that was interesting. Not sure if I am down to try that just yet. 
We ordered a half dozen. I personally liked the Samoas Hyack and the Cristiano Reynaldough yummy. 
I would definitely be back to try the others."}
{"text":"Love this place! Was originally looking for ice cream or shakes and found this gem. I got a pralina Gomez ice cream shake and it definitely was worth it! Soo good! Best I shakes ever! I love the funky names that each donut has, super creative and entertaining."}
{"text":"Came in craving something sweet after lunch and found this place so decided to come in around 1pm on a Saturday. Upon entering you see a brightly colored interior of pink and green and a wall full of the donuts available to order. 

We got a kronut, and two other specialty donuts along with an iced coffee. After my first bite of my donut I knew I was in for a real disappointment and unfortunately nothing else we ordered saved this experienced. All the donuts we had where stale and didn't have any real flavor. The iced coffee was very  watered down and it tasted like it was powdered iced coffee and couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"I love trying new donuts. After seeing many advertisements for this place I finally had the chance to try it one night. Well I'm not a fan of this new trend of overly decorated donuts as they are already a sugar bomb to begin with. At Crunch Donut none of them looked appetizing I think it was the lack of lighting in that place so I just decided on the glazed. If the glazed isn't good then typically the others will be just the same or worse. Well for $1 each it tasted about the same as a grocery store donut, but I'd be paying half as much at my local grocer. A $1 donut is relatively expensive for the quality you receive. Just go back to the basics its worked for Master Donuts, Winchells, Dunkin and Krispy for decades."}
{"text":"First time here and we had the Bananarama Split waffle and it was awesome. Nicole despite having to deal with several customers on her own had great customer service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok,
So we went and got 7 doughnuts: Heaven Bacon, Andes Sandburg, Leonardo Dioreo, Matt Frankdough, S'morgan Freeman, Dough Wayne Johnson, and a plain glazed Buttermilk Bar....

I have never been so happy in my life....ever....and I have children....

The heaven bacon is the best thing in the world....period."}
{"text":"Great donuts.   Great service.   Will be back.   So many selections.   The kids love this place.  Great atmosphere! They even offer limousine birthday parties for kids in their big pink donut limousine."}
{"text":"My son wanted donuts and instead of going to your run of the mill locations I decided a place unique to Las Vegas would be fitting. Before heading out I had to refer to my fellow Yelpers to help me find a great spot and I wasn't disappointed. With all the great reviews it made effortless to choose. The only negative would be the iced coffee but, I must mention my family are a bit of Starbucks fanatics. My daughter didn't finish her vanilla iced coffee as there wasn't any vanilla and the coloring was very dark. It didn't look anything like what was shown in the picture hanging on the wall. 

We were very happy with the selections of donuts and had lots of fun going over the funny names like the \"Dough Wayne Johnson\" or the \"Justin Timberglaze\". I have never before been to a place that served donut bacon cheeseburgers so, we had to try one! At first to me it seems like an odd combination but, the flavors do go pretty well together. The colors of the decor inside is fun and fresh and was an inviting atmosphere. Very cute and would be fun for little ones. Our visit here was a fun way to end our trip."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best gourmet donut place the make your own bar is so fun always get carried away"}
{"text":"What they have going for them: friendly people, creative names. 
Besides that, the yeast donut was dry, the old fashioned & vanilla cake ones had an odd flavor and were overly sweet with the toppings especially, the paint job is terrible-it just looks kind of ghetto inside & the music is way too loud. 
I personally won't be back.."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing the Kroprah all week (yes the names are very lulz). Finally decided to order it and was not dissapointed! Flaky yet chewy, creamy yet crunchy...its like a mix between a drumstick, a croissant, and an eclair. Lovely! Thanks, Crunch !"}
{"text":"A gourmet DONUT culinary ADVENTURE ;) The executive chef, master Donut maker / owner brings her unique twist of eastern europen creativity in combining NEW flavors and beutiful presentations of yummy donuts. Open 24 hours, and strategically located across the street from UNLV, a Las Vegas MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Update: I use to love this place. My girlfriend and I would constantly go here because they had such fun donuts and new ones would come out often. In my personal opinion, this place couldn't keep up. We would go when the place was still fresh and new and the quality of their donuts were amazing. As soon as they gained more popularity it's like the quality of the donuts was replaced with quantity. I can understand high demand, but the donuts were just stale, the cream cheese and the caramel they used tasted like they were a bit sour. I just really hope they find a way to change the quality so I can give a more positive and updated review.



This place is hands down amazing. 24 hrs and the owner and the people who help manage it are wonderful people and very nice. Very nice and delicious selections of specialty donuts and kronuts. I enjoy their donuts and how fulfilling it can be when eating. I love the way they name their donuts and is pretty clever. This is my new favorite donut spot! My favorite is the the Russel Kronut and the David Doughy. All I can say is keep it up guys because the hard work and service you guys provide is very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"I ordered uber eats thinking I would try out these gourmet donuts. Although we all appreciated the creative and tasty recipes, our dozen, every single donut tasted day old. Maybe because we ordered in the evening? Whatever the case, this is the most money I have ever paid for donuts that were not fresh tasting."}
{"text":"I was looking for a donut place that had unusual donut creations and found it here. Pleasant interior and fun selection of donuts. It was a decision between the Bradley Pooper and Snoop Dough G. The Sheryl Kronut won though. They tasted good although I guess they were sitting there for a lil while so they didn't have that fresh taste. We also had the Banana and Peanut Butter Waffles which were freshly made. Overall a fun visit and will return if I'm in Vegas and in the mood for a Bradley Pooper!"}
{"text":"Wife and I ventured into this place today.  The donuts were delectable.  I tried the Doughwayne Johnson and she had the Katy Cherry.  Whimsical names, good tasting donuts.  Hope they do well, we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Theses donuts are amazing!! I was very happy to discover this location. The area was a little questionable, but the service was good. The young lady did not know much about what was \"in\" the donuts, but they were absolutely DELIGHTFUL! 

This place is a definite must! They have some of the coolest donuts! We had the Leonardo Dioreo, the Katy Cherry, and the Beyoncé Doughles.

Can't wait to try another! But the Katy Cherry was off the chain! I could eat these in bulk!"}
{"text":"Poor review as we ordered from here using Uber Eats and our order was not what we ordered and there were NO UTENSILS in the bag!  This made eating the waffles very messy!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by after work to give this place another go... Back story though! My first order (about 6 specialties, bout 3 yeast specialties 3 cake specialties) I made was during a holiday, New Years Eve or New Years day, fairly late and I was definitely impressed the first time but only by the yeast donuts really and not so much the cake donuts (fairly dry). So I don't know if it was because it was a holiday and so late I got a stale batch of the cake donuts or something. Eh, still pretty good. The Samoas Hyack I was looking forward to, being a fan of the cookie. It just didn't hit the mark. Cake donut itself was kinda dry like the others, but the toppings itself just didn't smack me in the face like the cookie and it was really the most disappointing out of my order.

I mentioned this to who, I imagine, is the owner tonight and he decided to throw in a Samoas one for free as it is his favorite and was perplexed that I didn't like it. Case closed, this time around it was AWESOME. Took a bite and knew I had to throw up this review asap. I've yet to try the other 6 donuts out, but I'm sure I will enjoy them. 

Ultimately, I think the only thing that might hurt this place is the prices BUT being that these are specialty donuts (they have some regular kind too) that's open 24/7, that could be it's saving grace. Plus, out of all the specialty donut places (Pink Box & Donut Bar), this one seems to hit it's mark a lot better. It's not AS expensive either I believe (i.e. someone stating almost $7 for 2 donuts...) I believe their specialties are $1.99-2.50 range and you can get half a dozen specialties for about $10.99 or a dozen for $20. Not too bad. Their donuts are pretty big. Apple fritters were probably the largest I've seen and they were $1.99. 

Either way I was pleased the first time with some disappointment, but this 2nd visit definitely swayed me to return a couple more times..."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so good. I found my new donut spot. I've been to so many different donut places in Vegas & nothing compares to this delicious place!!! The names are super funny too which is a plus. I live all the way in Summerlin & I would gladly drive all the way down here for a donut. If you love Pink Box or Fractured Prune, YOU WILL LOVE THIS PLACE EVEN MORE."}
{"text":"Decent donuts with creative names, but nothing spectacular. Nice spot for UNLV students to grab something sweet since its right across the street from the SU."}
{"text":"SHORT VERSION: They've been open a few months and the space already looks run-down, donuts on display are unattractive and old-looking, the \"fresh, made to order\" donuts are not fresh at all, and they're overpriced for  the size. Service is worst of all: 5 customers walked out after waiting over half an hour for their orders because staff prioritized Uber Eats orders and ignored the people who were present. Maybe they were understaffed, but those present were working in slow motion, ignoring customers' questions and concerns, and unable to actually put out product. 

LONG VERSION: Entered to an empty store, ordered 3 single donuts, received them in about 10 minutes, at which point there was a line. 2 of 3 donuts were correct, staff seemed annoyed about having to correct the one wrong donut, we ate correct donuts on patio. S'Moregan Freeman was dry, marshmallow was hard. Cristiano Rinaldough was okay. Their award-winning free-trade coffee was alright but oddly served with powdered creamer and no sleeves for the hot cup. Waited 20 minutes for our last PB Angelina Jelly donut, went inside to inquire and was told they're working on it. Meanwhile, the dining room is full of seated patrons but none of them have received any donuts. 20 minutes later, still waiting. Customers are walking up to the fabric curtain to the back work area where staff are hiding, asking about their orders, and are told by employees (who don't make eye contact or even turn around!) that they're busy working on an Uber Eats order first. When the rest of the patrons realized I'd been waiting over half an hour for one donut, they all up and left. No refunds, they were just done. A few minutes later, with more verbal prompting, Andrew finally locates our donut.. in a box on the counter. Staff were indifferent to the fact that several customers had left and in lieu of an apology said, \"Yeah, we still have 1 dozen to make for Uber Eats and another for PostMates.\" The last donut? Lopsided and visibly smushed, tasted old, finally received after I asked for a refund and staff was unable or unwilling to provide it. 

PROS: They have patio seating, late-night hours, and fun donut names after celebrities. The toppings available are nicely on display in mason jars with tags and bows. But that's about it."}
{"text":"I'm a retired cop and I've had hundreds of doughnuts in my life time and these doughnuts are absolutely the best in the world. I want to overnight some to myself!"}
{"text":"Our experience here was not good; initially we were told the donuts in the case were for display and too old to sell. Then as the kid is filling our order he grabbed a glaze donut from the case WITH HIS BARE HANDS and put in our box. At first we thought surely we didn't just see that, then he comes out from the back carrying another donut in HIS BARE HANDS. When asked why gloves or tongs  were not used we were told he washed his hands often....uh, no thank you. If you don't mind some teenage kid grabbing your donuts with his bare hands, than this is the donut store for you!!"}
{"text":"I love the funny, cute donut names like Reese's Witherspoon, Ellen Doughgenerous and Brad Fritter. I asked the lady serving me who David Doughy was named after, but she didn't have a clue. I think the employees should know the celebrities the donuts are named after. I got the Reese's Witherspoon and Samoas Hyack. 

The decor is cute with green chairs with green and pink decor. The customer service was alright. The lady asked how old my son was.

The Reese's Witherspoon didn't taste good. Even my 2-year-old son didn't like it! The chocolate cake and chocolate topping had a weird flavor together. We didn't even finish it. I thought it would be good since it was mostly chocolate, but the only edible part was the Reese's pieces on top. The Samoas Hyack was ok. The donut part was sweet. I didn't think it tasted like a Samoas girl scouts cookie. The flavor was ok. 

For $2 per donut or so, I would expect the quality to be much better. I guess you're paying extra for the funny names."}
{"text":"Everyone that knows me knows I'm a donut junkie and that I absolutely love donuts!

I see them on uber eats and was near the store so I decided to pop in and see what they had to offer. (This was at 7 PM ) so I knew the donuts wouldn't be as fresh as the morning. When we arrived the only girl working there was putting an order together for UberEATS and said she would be with us in a moment.  She greeted us and took our order...she pulled the few donuts that I ordered and  I also ordered a waffle ice cream dessert.  She packed up the few donuts went in the back to make the waffle dessert and came out and asked me if I wanted drizzle on my dessert which I said yes but then noticed it was a donut not a waffle on my dessert. So  told her that was the wrong  thing but she said I already made it so I just said OK I'll take it and didn't argue about it or tell her to make it again. 

Got home to try the donuts and they were very dry the donut desert hardly had any drizzle on it at all. This concerns me because the owner of this shop is letting an  employee destroy their business as she just didn't care if the product look good or that my order was wrong after even telling her.

They don't have stellar reviews as it is and really should be five stars to compete with some of the better shops in town but this place is struggling."}
{"text":"Found by accident, one of THE best doughnut shops I've ever encountered.  Tim greeted us and told us all about the shop.  Tried two kinds of their funny named and great tasting confections.  Cannot wait to go back and try another!  Thanks for the great treat!!"}
{"text":"I'm not understanding the hate reviews of this place. It's a donut shop, duh, get over yourself. I admit it's not the best donut shop but it's open 24-hours and it's close-by to my house. 

Donuts, 24-hours, and close-by is a dangerous combination. Yep, I visit this place way more than I should. Mainly I go late at night when I want something ridic sweet and this place is the ticket. I've stopped getting their doughnuts because the consistency is so awful. There's days when they're awesome and days when they look like they've been picked from the trash. Pro-tip: the employees are really friendly, so if you see a donut that looks good in the case, ask for that one, else they're going to give you whatever random donut they pick. 

I usually stick with their donut shakes (yum!) and their waffles.  

I love their Facebook page. Their names are hilarious and they're always holding contests."}
{"text":"Awesome spot with great product! The doughnuts are all unique and great. I liked the one with Carmel and cream cheese. Quick walk from campus. I haven't tried the coffee or anything else.  They were even at the boxing matches Downtown. Great stuff."}
{"text":"I had a Chocolate covered Reeces Pieces Devil's Food Doughnut, and my son had The World's only Crount Twist best dougtnut ever! Returning soon for the doughnut burger because my son has been searching for months for a place that has them."}
{"text":"The donut bacon cheeseburger!!! OMG!! YES!! Mike was super cool and helpful!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't think this place couldn't mess up twice, but boy I was wrong! They didn't have a classic chocolate glazed bar donut and lady surprised me but saying no worries if they didn't have the donut they could make it. Let's start with that the donut itself was refried or a better description was a greased flat mess refrosted. 

The lady was friendly and did the best she could not totally her fault but this place being opened since March looks rushed to make some quick profit and showcase some dirty walls and floors good luck I won't talk about the disgusting box of 4 donuts I had the first time."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place and drove all the way from other side of Las Vegas to spoil my son and mom. There is a new owner, so hint of positivity and fresh wave is definitely there! Bright, cute place! So many choices of flavors! It is a perfect place for small group celebrations, enough space for party of 10! Owners are very opened and kind! Recommend!"}
{"text":"Fair prices for gourmet donuts are available anytime at this 24-7 cafe near UNLV, McCarran Airport, and the Strip. We ordered the Beyonce Doughles Lemonade, Sheryl Kronut, Angelina Jelly, and Kim Kardoughshian ... and that was plenty for the four of us to share."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with this place!

I went with the waffle with a banana split on top, basically. I forget the creative name they have for it but they have catchy names for everything on the menu. Really entertaining to read them all. 

The waffle was good, but not great. A little over cooked even. However it was made to order so nice and fresh. 

The place is nice and clean and has a cool theme inside. The service was very good. One young lady working and she was very friendly and welcoming and made the experience even better. 

Reasonably priced, and a good location (for me anyways since I work in the area.) 

I'm a big donut guy so i can't wait to go back and try their donuts. There's currently another donut spot in town that has my heart but I have a good feeling this place will be a contender. 

I highly recommend you stop by and give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Honestly they have good doughnuts; the Sunday I went in I got the apple fritter (the brad Pitt I think it's called:) and the Katie cherry? Anyhoo both good and fresh; even brought a cup of coffee and that was good; the decor was a bit tacky but I kinda think that's what they are going for ( I mean look at the big pink limo out front); they were yummy; I'll go back"}
{"text":"Dough Wayne Johnson? S'moregan Freeman? These puny doughnut names are just as enjoyable as their tasty donuts! 

Crunch Donut Factory has a wide variety of donuts, or you can opt to making your own. These donuts are on the sweet side.  The secret to trying all their donuts: bring all your friends and later split some of theirs and share some of yours (only if you want to!!) 

This location is convenient and a short walk across UNLV. Very clean and friendly service. 

Donut miss out! My faves (so far) include the fruity pebble and mint chocolate donuts. I'm definitely coming  back to satisfy my cravings!!"}
{"text":"Maple bars weren't good, the dough was fresh, but the maple flavor was overpowered by cold, extremely chewy bacon. The Samosas, were all right, but 17 dollars for 6 donuts is outrageous. The customer service left something to be desired as well. When we entered we were greeted with a \"Hello\", but when we said that it was our first time, we were met with a dismissive \"Well, we just opened, so...\" Overall its okay for what's there, but the maple bars at the seven eleven next to it would be a much better choice, for the wallet and pallet. I doubt I will be going again, regardless of the convenience."}
{"text":"I had been stalking this business for a bit here on yelp and finally decided to go this morning. As soon as you open the door the yummy smell of fresh donuts greets you! Happy fun bright colors andvery nice girl working the counter. My husband got the reeses witherspoon donut and i had the lemony snicketts .. wow so flipping good! We are from the east coast so we had been dunkin donuts fans but this place is now our favorite. We will certainly be back to try something else"}
{"text":"Having personally learned how to make donuts from scratch, my review may be a little more critical than others so I'll try to stick to the other things first.

Strange smell upon arriving inside. 
Not only was the girl sick while handling the food AND money by herself but she seemed to kind of be rushing me while being extra friendly to others. Two guys in front of me and she was chatting it up with them. With me, it felt like I was annoying her by asking what is popular to try. Then, at the register, as I'm paying, a customer wanted more coffee and was all up in my face trying to push his way in. ALSO, another customer that was just coming in ( who it sounded like she knew ), her attention was on him before I was even done. Tables were dirty. 

Ok, so onto the actual product, the donuts. I'm not so sure I like the idea of being able to create your own. I learned how to make donuts from scratch and I found that the toppings need to be applied while still warm. The donuts for create yourself are in room temp storage so I'm curious as to how those actually are. But, tasting the donut, I realized why...they use a different type of flour that is more of a cake type batter so it can sustain the sitting. Furthermore, the toppings are also more of a cake icing ganache based topping. 

This place should be called CAKES....not donuts. So, in that sense, they aren't bad cakes but they certainly aren't traditional type donuts. They are just shaped like donuts. Donuts are fluffy and moist. These are full bodied and more towards the dry side which is why the icing is important. 

This is why I give 3 stars. If there was another helper and the service was better, I might give a better rating. But, with donuts a block away that are real donuts and less than a dollar for one, it's gonna be hard to compete. Also, 7/11 next door with dollar donuts ( given again that these are more cakes ), I will be curious to see how this place does in the coming year."}
{"text":"24hrs...best of both worlds when you order a donut into a shake awesome service too! Can't get wrong the donut names too."}
{"text":"I had a peanut butter/jelly donut and a maple bacon bar. The peanut butter/jelly was okay and the maple bacon had barely cooked bacon on it which just grossed me out lol so I couldn't eat it. Both donuts cost about $6.00 which is pretty high unless your donuts are off the charts in taste (these are definitely not). They are across from UNLV and if they want to even cater to students they'll need to come down in the prices. I predict they won't be around this time next year. I can't recommend due to taste and cost."}
{"text":"I came across this place online and thought I'd try it out and compare it to some other donut places I've tried. It's not well advertised, so if you're not actually looking for it, you'd drive right by it and miss out. Inside, it's pretty small, but very colorful and cheerful. It took a bit before anybody came from the back and greeted us. We went in the evening so some of the donuts were already sold out. They name all their donut flavors based on celebrities. We got:
Heavon Bacon 
P.B. Angelina Jelly
Marilyn MonDough
Prailina Gomez
Katy Cherry
Dough Wayne Johnson

Some I liked. Others I didn't really care for. The yeast donuts, flavors were good, but they were a little dry. I liked the heavon bacon one and the Katy Cherry one the best. The flavors were great. The PB Angelina Jelly was good, but there was ALOT of jelly. I wish they just filled it with jelly and covered the top in the peanut butter icing instead of loading it up with more jelly. It was a bit too much. The cake donuts weren't as soft as I was expecting. The Marilyn MonDough has an icing on it that left a waxy coating in my mouth that I really didn't like. My boyfriend didn't mind it tho. Prices weren't too bad. I think we paid $10-11 for a half dozen of the premium flavors."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw this was a new Donut shop!!! I am OBSESSED with donuts, lol!! My husband and I were surprised to see how large of a Donut selection there was. All different kinds, with all kinds of yummy toppings and/or fillings. We decided on the \"Katy Cherry\" & \"Beyonce Lemonade\". THEY WERE BOTH DELICIOUS!!!! Very well made and fresh. My only complaint is the young man behind the counter didn't really explain their menu or how everything worked but the again I didn't specifically ask him to so can I really complain?

You can also customize your own Donut! The have a station with a variety of toppings and sprinkles. I also saw that there is cupcakes and milkshakes. I'll have to try them for sure!! 

The decor inside is cute and I really hope this shop can be a new hit in the neighborhood. I'd love to see them stay and expand!! I'm not sure how much their food cost to make the donuts are but if the prices were just a tad lower that would be awesome but everybody's got to make a living. Definitely reccomend stopping by this place!!"}
{"text":"They have good donuts here. I came in one early morning Monday to get my week started but the two ladies here weren't in that much of a good mood. Bad vibes, but decent donuts..."}
{"text":"I tried all the donuts in the display case and they were all coyingly sweet so it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. I prefer Pink Box Donuts because the flavours seem more blanaced. Ill probably return to Crunch once more to try their waffles and milk shakes but the donuts arent even comparable to Krispy Cream or Pink Box."}
{"text":"Mike the owner makes the most creative, delicious and original doughnuts ive ever tasted. Very friendly service. 5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"I walked in the store expecting a huge selection of donuts but it was very limited.  The store didn't look very attractive , however I got me a Reese's chocolate cake donut to try.  It was moist and not too sweet just the way I like it, it did lack the chocolate flavor, overall taste is ok.  I thought $2 for a donut  was expensive ."}
{"text":"Great menu of different donuts, waffles and even cheeseburger donuts. I ordered a variety for National Donut Day and brought them to work. I was very popular with my colleagues. Fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Place is Great. Smells awesome. Great for late night eats. Big variety of donuts. Ordered the burger with bacon and cheese."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one near UNLV, but when I discovered this one near my house, I am hooked. Place is small, clean, and staff is friendly. I like it way better than the other place. Offer the same great donuts, same taste, better experience."}
{"text":"These are some of the best donuts I've ever had!  I am NOT a donut person at all but I could probably eat a donut from here every day.  We've been to several donut shops in Las Vegas and none can compare to the quality, the names of the donuts, or the prices.  The people that work here are also very friendly!  It's pretty funny that people are complaining about the prices because these are really inexpensive donuts especially compared to Donut Bar.  The whiners must think 7/11 is gourmet or something.  
Our favorites are the Katy Cherry, the Beyoncé Doughles Lemonade, the Cristiano Rinaldough, and the Russell Kronut and it was all $9 for 4 large donuts.  DEFINITELY not a bad price.  If you're too poor to eat a $2 donut, maybe you should stick to 7/11. 
Seriously, go here and you won't be sorry!  They also do deliver through Uber eats and it's awesome because they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"The aroma slaps you in the face as soon as you hit the door! Warm sugar goodness fills the air as your eyes begin to fixate on the multitude of colorful doughy delights that await you. The Crunch Donut Factory will excite you and send you into sensory overload with fun & creative selections like the Andes Samberg, David Doughy, Katy Cherry, and my personal favorite...The Bradley Pooper. If that's not enough, you can order a donut burger ... yes an actual burger between two donuts!!! There are many other great treats to be had here as well. So, if you are out in the North Valley stop by and treat yourself... you will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, tacky decorations and pretty good donuts, been there a couple of times. I enjoy it. The fact that it's open 24 hours is a big plus."}
{"text":"Tim helped us get all our favorite donuts!  So happy they have this new location closer to our home. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a snack since it was almost dinner time so we decided to stop in and check out Crunch Time you walk in and you immediately become happy it's such a fun atmosphere love the colors and the doughnuts have awesome names!  Soon as we walked in we were greeted by a Very friendly face named Ash!  She was very delightful and cheerful and was so very happy.  We ended up getting 1/2 fox doughnuts and 2 chocolate mills and they were amazing!  We will certainly be back!  Hopefully all the staff is amazing as Ash is!"}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious! Coolest donuts and coolest names! Late hours and great customer service! Must try. :-)"}
{"text":"Very unique & fun donut shop across from UNLV! 

We tried the Leonardo DiOreo and the Bacon Maple bar and honestly the Bacon Maple bar was super delicious!! It's the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The bacon is cured so it tastes freshly cooked which I very much enjoyed. The maple glaze on the bar wasn't very sweet which I was worried about at first but after having a bite, it's one of the best donuts I've had compared to Dunkin Donuts, Winchell's, Krispy Kreme, and even Donut Bar in downtown. 

Highly recommend you check this place out, they even serve milkshakes and other goodies! :)"}
{"text":"Getting donuts at night is awesome. It was fun to read all the cute celebrity donut names.
Only 1 guy working but he was friendly. The donuts were inventive. Not the freshest but we did go at night.
Will definitely check this place out again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a dozen from this place and it came out to over $30. They sent me 8 instead of the 12 I ordered, and 2 of those 8 were not what I ordered. The food is stale and looks like it's been sitting all day long. Fortunately I was able to get a refund due to this colossal screw up. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I see crunch donut on my fb timeline just about everyday. So after class my friend and I decided to stop by. What really grabbed our attention were the pink limos. This place is decked out in pink and donuts. The walk of fame stars are hilarious.  Each celebrity name has to do with donuts.  Well of course there's a variety of donuts along with ice cream and waffles.  These sweet treats are mouth watering. The prices are reasonable too! I enjoyed my donut with coconut, caramel and plain donut. It wasn't that fresh,  but next time I'll choose another one."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have not only a new donut shop in the neighborhood, but HELLO- it's a CUSTOMIZABLE donut bar!!! Oh- AND YOURE OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY? hello new friend! 
I bought a premade one because it was already perfect- blueberry cake with a ring of cream cheese frosting and a  dollup of blueberry goo- and it was delicious!!! It wasn't too sweet , which I find in a lot of donut places lately. It was really good! 
They also have donut milkshakes and frozen custard sandwiches. 
DONUT MILKSHAKES.
You should go, right meow."}
{"text":"My niece was so excited to go and get donuts we get home and they are all stale like they've been out for 2 days or so totally disgusting and a waste of my money!! It was only 11:30 am there is no reason for the donuts not to be fresh"}
{"text":"I have to say that this is definitely a great find around UNLV; A cute gem hidden around the 7/11 and Roberto's. 

First of all, the place itself is adorable. Bright, fun colors of pink and green highlight the place. As you enter through the front you see an array of donuts to the left and numerous booths to the right. It reminds me of a candy store or a cute sweets shop, which it is, but with amazing donuts! 

If you've been looking for delicious donuts as well as a wow-factor, I'd say try this place out. The donuts have super fun names that describe the donuts well. (Lemon filled yeast donut called \"Beyoncé Doughles Lemonade\" and \"David Doughly\") and they are the spot to find CRONUTS! I've been looking for cronuts every where, and I've finally found them hidden amongst other delicious donuts. 

Another fun factor: they have donut SHAKES. You heard it right. You can select a donut, some toppings I believe as well, and they turn it into a shake. I've never had it, but I will definitely be back when I'm in the area :)"}
{"text":"The donut place claims to open 24/7 however I stoped by on a Friday afternoon and it was closed, I went back another time and it was open for a big disappointment the doughnuts do looked good but didn't taste good. The frosting on the doughnuts tasted like thick canned frosting, not fresh at all and  flavorless"}
{"text":"When I went into the store I was let down by the size of the display case and then realized how small some of these donuts really are despite your pictures people!

So I picked out the 2 largest donuts I could find: the Katy Cherry and Angelina Cherry and was seriously let down!

First of all idiots, the Katy Cherry has no cream cheese inside her as its just on top of a plain yeast donut!  That's it idiots!  What a crappy donut!  No surprise in the middle as I wanted to eat her out deep from the inside expecting all that gooey cream cheese.  This donut is nothing more than a plain yeast donut serving as a carrying vehicle for very plain topping.  

Next, I had high hopes for Angelina Cherry but was also let down.  Very little peanut butter taste to the frosting which made it taste more like a cupcake rather than a topping for a donut.  Inside her was bright red artificial cherry filing so I ate out Angelina from the inside unlike the dry Katy.  This was a big donut in size but just plain.  I was tempted to try the Brad Fritter but it kind of looked like what my cat throws up.  Maybe next time I will make a trip to choked down Brad.

I passed on the tiny $1 donuts as they were just too small to waste the calories.  Seriously I laughed so hard at the size of those little suckers!

The guy behind the counter was nice and told me they charge an extra $0.35 for credit cards which none of you morons posted.  Also, the Angelina Cherry had a sign saying $2.50 but was only charged $2 for it!  HAHAHHAHHAHA!  Man these UNLV students are really dumb with their friggin social media crap wanna-bees-kim-craptasian!  Stick to writing term papers and not reviews of donuts children!"}
{"text":"Young lady was nice. Got home & realized she didn't put one in I had requested but thank goodness I was not charged. My family & I bought 8 donuts & one scoop of ice cream w/m&ms for grand-she loved the ice cream. Two out of 8 donuts was dry but all the others were very good. We will go back from time to time. I noticed there were fresh do nuts on a rack which probably should have been pulled from since it was obvious b/c Ines we bought there were maybe one or two left after we bought our choices. I would have requested it if we had not noticed when paying the rack was suiting there. Next time if it appears there are fresher ones on rack I definitely will ask!"}
{"text":"I walked in an began to look at the selection and I wasn't even acknowledged by the staff. They were having a what must have been a very important conversation for them to completely ignore a customer. Maybe it was because I'm a black male and they just assumed I didn't have money. I'm just going to bank on the fact that they must be doing very well for them to ignore customers. The hospitality industry is suffering because of places like this. Rude inhospitable employees."}
{"text":"This place has  very good tasting desserts variety of range and delicacy of donuts with desserts & many side topping for ice cream or desserts."}
{"text":"Went here with all the fantastic reviews and pics. All I can say is don't do it. I was there at 8:00 a.m. and the donuts tasted like they were made yesterday at best. Very stale!  I walked 4 miles for this and it was simply bad. Went to 7-Eleven for breakfast since this was so bad. It was better."}
{"text":"Tried a Sheryl Cronut on my 1st visit here. It was good.  Sort of tasted like canned apple pie filling and a Pillsbury Grands \"Flaky\" biscuit. Unfortunately, I was accosted by not one, but two beggars on my short walk to and from the door to my car parked just feet away. I would like to come back to try the iced coffees, but all the beggars trolling the area are a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"Coziest donut place in town. The whole thing. Ordered on UberEATS, and no regrets. Everything was cozy and awesome."}
{"text":"I really hate to give 3 stars because the place is really cute and the girl was wonderful but :( my order wasn't good. I had a \"donut shake\" and well sad to say I would never recommend it. Technically you pick a donut then it's blended with vanilla ice cream and served as a shake. Well sounds bomb but honestly just taste like milk and bread nothing too special and my donut was a chocolate cheesecake caramel and my shake tasted nothing like it. I'd say get just a donut and a shake on the side :)"}
{"text":"The only thing I expected from this place was just simply.. Donuts. Hence, the name. lol So I was taken by surprise when I saw they had a waffles menu, with the option of customizing one with different toppings. For all you pancake lovers out there, waffles are better. :]

The lady working behind the counter seemed nice at first, but when it came time to order, she looked really annoyed. I don't know if it's because it was late or she had a bad day, but it was not a good interaction. I felt like I had to hurry up and order and not ask too many questions before she gets even more irritated. 

I customized my waffle with just vanilla ice-cream and Nutella drizzle. We tried another dessert place before coming to this one, and I needed something that wasn't too much over the top! Hahaa

My sister got the Bananarama Split and my brother ordered the Pecan & Nutella waffle. All were pretty good and we had no major complaints. Although, my sis did complain to me that her waffle was overcooked and a lil hard.

Almost all their menu items are named after famous celebrities. However, they have a lil twist on them. I think you know who Leonardo DiOreo, S'Morgan Freeman, and Dough Wayne Johnson are. LOL I thought that was pretty clever.

We were all just too full to try any donuts or take some home, but it gives us more reason to come back. Despite the hint of unfriendliness in the beginning, I think we'll give this place another chance to redeem themselves on that. At least when we left, that same employee gave us a nice farewell.

Pro-Tips:
-Open 24/7!
-It's across the street from the UNLV campus"}
{"text":"Donuts were amazing.  It was my first time and Tim showed me what was popular and told me about other products they had like the shakes and desserts.  My favorite was the cronut with the chocolate & peanuts on it. I think it's called the cropah. I think it would be more amazing with almonds on it. I'm definitely taking my kids here for the donut station and the donut ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"The names of the treats are worth the trip. Heaven Bacon was quite heavenly!  Love maple and bacon!!!"}
{"text":"First time stopping by after seeing them on postmates so often.  Boy,  am I glad I did,  its a really beautiful shop that smelled of deliciousness. They had the old fashioned doughnuts that my pregnant belly was leading me on the late night run for and a huge selection of specialities.  My kids got a doughnut with fruity pebbles and my birthday girl chose a really cute cupcake with pearls.  What made this place really unique was the lady running the shop,  Lita, brought out a cupcake for my baby gul with a lit candle.  What an experience, will definitely be back as this baby grows!"}
{"text":"Today was the first day I visited this place. I guess all those bad reviews were from previous ownership. Now it's under new management and ownership. The lady is very  nice and the place is pretty welcoming. Nice flowers  on the bar area with the outside view. There was a couple sitting next to me on their first date, and I think this place suited their romantic mood very nicely. Coffee was well brewed and donuts  OMG! How fresh they are! I've heard that before with previous owners they baked everything elsewhere and where delivering them to the store. Not this time. They bake it right there, fresh from the start. So if you happen to be close to the strip, check this place out. You won't regret it!  And bring you loved ones to share those sweet moments. Don't forget to take a picture with Mr. Donut. He loves hugs also"}
{"text":"Clever names on all the donuts. The ones we tried were delicious....but the Andes Samberg milkshake was to die for. Service was great! Will definitely be coming back to try the waffles."}
{"text":"This spot is open 24 hours and has specialty donuts/cronuts with cute celebrity-based names. What's not to like!? The staff has always been friendly and helpful...you can also have them make a custom one for you. I have visited plenty of times and have tried a variety and I'm usually always pleased. However, there has been a time or two where I have discovered the donut had probably been out for awhile. If you know they've been sitting, please just make a fresh one! But to be honest, this place is still pretty good so I will be going back."}
{"text":"We came for dessert. The doughnut names were funny, but that's about it. They seemed understaffed. The people there were nice but seemed frustrated with each other. There were 3 employees there however only 1 of them was scheduled to work that shift. We ordered a shake and said there was a wait due to there only being 1 blender with 3 orders ahead of us. One of the girls came up front mad because the other 2 that were helping customers didn't hEar the waffle maker ding and burnt the waffles. Employees were talking under their breath about how they'd be happy to go home."}
{"text":"Awesome doughnuts even better service from Ash ... yay got a 4 pack of greatness  and there open 24hrs"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I live super close and they are open 24 hours a day! The lady made the donuts fresh for us! They were delicious and all the donuts are named after celebrities!"}
{"text":"Literally the best donuts I've ever had. They were so soft and delicious. You honestly can't go wrong with any choices and the names are so funny and cute! I'm surprised there not as busy for being so darn cute. Makes you feel like a doughnut factory."}
{"text":"Went there on 5/7 at 2:13 pm. Business hours state they are open mornings Sun 8am-10pm and Sun evenings 630-10. Posted business hours are a little confusing. We walked up to the door the door was locked for some reason, but an employee unlocked the door and let us in. No greeting, nothing said, leaving us at the donut case to start deciding on our choices. She eventually comes up, my husband tells her he wants one of their cinnamon roll looking donuts. She says they don't have that one for sale, even though they have 2 in the case. We thought ok no biggie, maybe they don't sell them after a few hours because they're not as fresh.  She then states that some of the donuts are not available for sale. I asked her which ones were available, she reiterates that the cinnamon is not available. At this point we decide to not continue to try to figure out which donuts in their 80% full case were available. We thank her and tell her we weren't getting anything, she looks at us and says \"someone will be here at 3 that could make more donuts\" we said it was ok and we walked out. We weren't even 5 steps away from the door when she locked it again! Not sure why the door is locked during what seems to be business hours and not sure why their case is just about full of \"display\" donuts. Overall, it was a very poor first impression and will for sure not be back. Sad to see a new business in the community be so dismissive of the people that it depends on to continue to stay open."}
{"text":"Im from LA. We have some pretty good donuts shops around so I may be a little bias. However the donuts were pretty stale. Maybe its because we ordered them late or perhaps since we ordered delivery they sent us the stale ones on purpose. 

I love the name concepts and all that but I was not impressed by the product."}
{"text":"Loaded up my kids for a 20 min drive. Walked in place was cute on the Website they had many options to choose from. When we arrived not to many options left Customer service wasn't that great felt a little rushed I think her guest that she had there was waiting for her so she was trying to rush us out. The Ellen donut wasn't that good the cereal tasted a little stale. The donut it self has a diffrent texture not light and airy like a regular donut. My kids enjoyed it but he they are kids."}
{"text":"I had the other location bookmarked, so when I saw that this new one opened up in the former Tiabi spot, I was excited to check them out. Walking inside I was greeted by, Tim. He said that I could pick from one of their custom donuts or choose my own toppings and he'd add them to some made donuts in the back. The names of the donuts were both comical, cute and clever. Inside there is some seating, but not much. Besides donuts they also have waffles and donut shakes on the menu. 

Crunch Roast Craft Coffee ($1.99 for 12 oz) - I originally asked for a French Vanilla Cappuccino, but Tim was going to make it with a packet of powder and water. Ummm, no thanks! I noticed a coffee bag with their name on it, so I asked about it. Tim said that it's their very own special blend that they get from a place in Colorado. I asked to have that instead and he switched my drink with no problem. I then head over to their little station in the corner that has the cream and sugar. I was so surprised that this place would have their own coffee blend, yet have a can of powdered creamer out to put in it. I decided to just add cream and sugar when I got home since I was taking my donuts to-go. I have to say that I was very surprised at how fresh and delicious the coffee was! I'd stop back by just for that and of course add my own cream and sugar. 

Priced at $7.99 I got a 4-pack of donuts and a 5th was thrown in free which was nice.

Samosas Hyack - This is their tribute to the popular girl scout cookie and it was very very very good! I wish I had gotten 4 of these lol. If I stop by for coffee again, I'll try this one to see if it's consistent. 

Beyonce Doughles - Lemon filled and dusted with powdered sugar, this donut was not packing the lemon flavor I'd hoped though the donut did taste fresh, unlike some of the others I picked out. 

Leonardo DiOreo - This chocolate cake donut was a winner between both myself and hubby. It wasn't dry and there was a generous amount of crushed cookies on the top. 

Katy Cherry - The cherries they used for this donut straight up tasted like cold canned cherry pie filling. The donut itself was dry and didn't taste fresh. The icing used had good flavor. 

Churro - There was a good amount of cinnamon and sugar on the outside of this one, but the churro itself was dry. 

One thing to keep in mind is they are open in the morning from 7 am until noon and then they open back up again later on from 6:30 pm until 10 pm at night during the week, but are open all day long on the weekends (call to check the hours might change). I like the concept they have going, however not all of the donuts seemed fresh and that's super important. Lots of hits and misses."}
{"text":"I love donuts, and I love ice cream, so this place is like heaven. I had a fruity pebble donut milkshake and split a Dough Wayne Johnson donut with my brother. Both were delicious. He had a s'mores donut milkshake that was also out of this world."}
{"text":"So good!! We stopped here after a show because my husband wanted something sweet. They have a really awesome selection of doughnuts with very clever names. You can even build your own doughnut! They are open 24 Hours. Nicole was very friendly and was happy to answer all of our questions and make suggestions. We cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here as and ordered the Cinnamon Roll it was crunchy and filled with grease.  The apple Fritter wasn't any better.  The Oreo and the Butterfinger donuts were hard and dry.  The Katy Cherry was ok and the strawberry glaze.  We spent $22 getting 15 donuts WE WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"While it is nice to have a gourmet donut store in North Las Vegas, this donut facility falls far from the mark.  It is creative - they have interesting combinations and flavors - but reality of the donuts is far from the beauty the name entices.  The donuts where thick, and you could feel the oil in them.  They tasted stale and hard and  there is an over reliance on cream, and there is an over sampling of cereal ontop of a donut.  

I have never in my life seen a donut box left uneaten- we got 4 donuts, and threw them out- kids took 1 bite and spit it out. We will even eat day old donuts from other places, but these - straight to the dust bin.    We are sorry to say, you would be better off with a grocery store donut than these."}
{"text":"Eclectic mix of donuts with plenty of combinations that I have never seen or heard of before. All of the donuts have cute/silly celebrity names and I appreciate the extra flair.

I would definitely recommend the Katy Cherry donut and my husband really likes the Beyonce lemonade donuts.

This place has excellent customer service, and on my most recent visit I was helped by Ash. She is bubbly, helpful, and clearly enjoys her job. Definitely check this spot out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here and I personally liked the donuts. I love the creative combinations and names. We were helped by Kevin who is awesome and friendly. My kids enjoyed 3 each as well as myself and my boyfriend. They did not taste like they were made the day we went but they weren't too bad. I had the Katy Cherry, Smorgan Freeman and the Doughwayne Johnson. The Katy Cherry was my favorite then comes the Smorgan Freeman then the Doughwayne Johnson. The only downside to this place is the coffee and high priced milk. We paid $2+ for a 16 oz or 24oz milk. And the coffee was very gross. I'm not sure what brand they use but its a BIG step down from a gas station coffee. It's on the Krispy Creme level of coffee which is disgusting to me. 

Other than the coffee the inside is cute and we enjoyed the day went because it was not busy at all and there was enough seating to go around. I think if they get better tasting coffee this place will be THE PLACE to go to especially when near a college."}
{"text":"Super fun names for their unique doughnuts.

Arrived there before midnight, and even though it's open 24/7 there was not much of a selection. The ones that were left were actually all pretty similar as most of them were cream filled. Was hoping for a traditional doughnut to go along with our special blend but it wasn't offered on the menu and didn't see any."}
{"text":"I will try their donuts and update our review later... 

We ordered on uber eats...

We were excited this place was open late and we were looking for a midnight desert, they had some delicious looking waffles....

Bananarama Split was supposed to come with ice cream and it did not. My wife ordered the Heaven Spacey. Neither was good. 

They both were supposed to have fresh strawberries, they seemed like the canned strawberry syrup with chunks of strawberries. 

My kids wouldn't even eat them. 

Anyways, we are quite annoyed. But we ordered 4 donuts for the morning, I know they won't be as fresh, but they have to be better than these failed waffle deserts!

Unless these donuts impress us in a big way, I will never order from here again, open 24 hours or not....

Update:

Moved it up a few stars. The donuts were delicious. I mean very good. I had a Samoas Hyack, caramel icing with a crunchy coconut with chocolate drizzled. I didn't taste the donuts the rest of the family had, but they also like theirs. 

I will probably go back for donuts, and it is possible our waffles were just made by the \"B\" crew, not sure. But I will never order a waffle from them again.

UPDATE 2: Back to 1 star due to employee incompetence. 


We had a guy from their business respond saying sorry and offering free food.  However we didn't take him up on it because I wanted to do so in person. 

We ordered UberEATS again, but just ordered their delicious donuts. The delivery was here super fast. Thanks uber!

We ordered their dozen donuts. And we ordered 2 extra bacon maple bars. The receipt was correct. We paid for everything. 

In our dozen, 2 Angelia Jelly were supposed to be included, but somehow got left out. 

The guy who responded to my original review, admitted my waffles were made by the \"B\" crew in the middle of the night, guess the daytime weekend crew must also be a \"B\" crew?

2 out of 2 times they botched our order and didn't give us what we bought. And one time they gave us horrible inedible food. 

So... I no longer have interest in the free food they offered as I don't care to have another order messed up, I can get my order correct elsewhere for half the price."}
{"text":"Super nice owners. Went the extra mile to make my coffee fresh and the donuts were super yummy. It's perfectly pink inside. Super cute atmosphere and very clean."}
{"text":"Our new fav dessert place! Huge selection, open 24/7 and names that will make you lol! Mike was super nice and helpful. We got Christiano Ronaldo which is like a Boston Cream and S'Morgan Freeman (and four more). Our son got a donut shake and had his mind blown! All of them were good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great doughnuts and imaginative names for everything I personally like the blue Carey their blueberry doughnuts and the crunch a cake doughnut with pink frosting whipped cream and sprinkles topped with a red gumball"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying donuts here and let me tell you these was the best donuts I've ever had! Taste super fresh. They have a huge variety of donuts to choose from. Cute and clean place. Check them out! 
Thank you for the great customer service! I will definitely going back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Went there today around noon with my dad since we were nearby and hadn't had breakfast yet (donuts are breakfast food, right?). Service was friendly and quick. I had a Lemony Snicket donut and my dad had a Katy Cherry. They were so good that we took a half dozen to go. Prices are decent too, with basic donuts for $1 and the special donuts for like $2-$3."}
{"text":"Finally made it BEFORE NOON! my tummy is now satisfied to try this scrumptious place. Super adorable little doughnut shop! I was greeted with a friendly smile and run through of all the doughnuts. I've never been to a create your own donut.  I wasn't feeling artistic during my visit since I was on the go so I wasn't able to get creative. Fruity pebbles are my WEAKNESS! So my tastebuds were going bananas as I ate the Ellen doughnut. I recommend this place! And it's not crazy busy which is a plus! Can't wait to bring my sister here"}
{"text":"I'm not usually into \"crazy\" donuts; however, we saw this place on UberEATS and decided to give it a try. It was around 7pm on a Saturday night. We expected our donuts to be a little crusty as it was so late in the evening. We were wrong! Our donuts were super fresh and tasted great. They were decent sized and had a good amount of toppings. 

This is definitely not the kind of place you can eat everyday, but next time I'm craving something really unhealthy, this place tops my list."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the doughnuts we got today. I was hesitant to order anything when we entered because the even though the place was empty the tables were dirty, the floor was really dirty, especially from what I could see behind the counter into the kitchen area, and the doughnuts looked pretty small for what they cost. Once we got home with our box we noticed the guy didn't get our order right and they were not fresh at all. This was such a fail for the amount of money spent. There are better doughnut shops in town."}
{"text":"Omg I had to try them all and they are in UberEATS so that made it possible lol love the Ellen doughnut lol"}
{"text":"I brought my two year old daughter in for her birthday along with my best friend, who is from out of town. The young lady helping us striked up conversations with us and even put a birthday candle in my daughter's donut! I thought that was very sweet. 

Customer service was excellent and the donuts were great! I can't wait to go back and try the waffles and shakes!"}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in Vegas and when I was a kid there was a place around the Lakes called Lamars, they had these amazing cake donuts topped with mini m&ms but they were ahead of their time with the crazy donut fad so they closed years ago. I was so excited to see another place doing these types of donuts so I was eager to try this place. 

I'm giving this place 2 stars because it's 24/7 and my husband liked their soft serve, but that's the extent of the positives. We get there and I get it was late because this was about 130 am, we'd just left a friends birthday and we have a friend staying with us so we figured it'd be nice to get some donuts. We get there and it was us and another couple and the girl says \"I'll be with you in just a minute.\" I've worked retail, I'm very patient, so I say \"no problem.\" I understand she's by herself so I wait. She's gone for 5+ minutes and the other couple starts whispering wondering why it's taking so long and I'm wondering the same. She finally re-emerges and doesn't seem thrilled to be at work and she seems like she may have a cold. I request a few donuts as the case is missing several of the flavors, it's the middle of the night, I get it, but the few other 24/7 shops make the donuts fresh every few hours. She starts packing my donuts into a plastic container, I've never seen this at a donut shop and I try to use as little plastic as possible, so it was a weird to see. She then crammed all my donuts into one container which smushed my donuts into each other and got icing from some of them onto the others, so that was annoying. 

The donuts were a complete let down, they tasted like gas station donuts and were not worth the price tag. 5 donuts and soft serve for about $16. Cake donuts should have a firm and somewhat crisp exterior with a cake center, these were insanely soft throughout but not in a good way. They tasted like the box donuts you get at the store that are basically just sugar and preservatives. I've never had a more disappointing donut in my life. Also, the Eminem donuts are advertised as being covered on top, when in reality it's a slight sprinkle of m&ms. 

Honestly, I just think this place is trying to do too many things. They do specialty waffles, make the fad cereal and bacon donuts, and also do soft serve with a toppings bar. Pick one thing and be good at it, don't go so overboard. They're trying so hard to be Voodoo donuts on steroids and it's a cheap imitation. I really don't understand the positive reviews, maybe some of them are from closer to when they opened. I definitely won't be back unless they changed their cake donut recipe, made the Eminem donuts as advertised, and used boxes like every other donut shop and not plastic."}
{"text":"Maybe its not cost effective to have fresh donuts in the middle of the night. 

I was on this side of town for sushi that was too packed to get in before close, so i stopped here for a quick snack to hold me off before getting back to my side of town. $2.50 for a single donut? Maybe it's that good.. nope it was dry and tasted like it had been sitting in that window all day. It was about 11 pm at night so i figure this was the reason why but still that's a bit disappointing for the money. If you have had a plain glazed donut from Randy's, and taste how it melts in your mouth....THAT is a donut. This is a gimmick with too many ingredients on a dry donut to try to spruce it up."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place!
We spent a good breakfast there.
Also I want to say that owners are great and friendly guys too"}
{"text":"The most amazing donuts I have had.  Bright and fun atmosphere.  Help was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in after drinking at Container Park for Chinese New Year.... we had a drunken hankering for a sprinkle and an old fashioned. 
Located by by UNLV, by Robertos, not in the nicest area, it is open late, so that's nice. 
Greeted by the owner who explained that donuts are in the case are there for purchase, or if you have something special he'll make it for you quickly. That sprinkle that had been whispering in my ear for an hour was not in the case, so yeah, go makes me one, por favor. Then my hubby grabbed a glazed old fashioned and an old fashioned with chocolate icing. I took a bite of each and each was delicious. The cake donut is my favorite over a raised donut, I must admit. 
The names of the donuts are quiet cheeky, the Brad Fritter, Bet E White, Snoop Doggy Dough, or something like that, I'm probably butchering the names. 
They also have waffles and I read there donut shakes? Craziness..."}
{"text":"After waiting several months I was excited to try Crunch Donut Factory and to be honest with you I was shocked at how tasteless the donuts actually were.

They look amazing and the price is decent but I will have to see the overall taste was very much below par when it comes to donuts.

The lady who served us was very very kind and I do appreciate the great customer service but I probably would not return based on the fact that the donuts tasted like they had that weird waxy taste that gets stuck on the roof of your mouth when you have a low-quality ingredients."}
{"text":"It was Sunday morning and there was only one worker. Apparently, there were no waffles or bacon. It took forever and much respect for the man that had to be the only one working that morning for keeping a good attitude. Donuts were okay and prices were kind of high."}
{"text":"Walked in here on Christmas Eve at about 3 AM. Was greeted by a very cheerful and attentive associate. Donuts are super creative and ingeniously named. Definitely cured my 3 AM sweet tooth. Whenever I come to visit Vegas again I'll make sure to stop by.

P.S. - I highly suggest giving your donut a 10 to 15 second warm up in the microwave before indulging. Trust me and thank me later. Don't forget to add a swirl of vanilla ice cream on top."}
{"text":"Ever since I have discovered this place through ubereats I literally can't stop ordering food from them everyday. I really shouldn't be having Donuts as often as I have been, but this place is soooooo good."}
{"text":"Stop by today on a fluke. I was reading online the different names and flavors of donuts. My fav anywhere is the apple fritter and this place did not disappoint  me. I was greeted warmly and the display case is the first thing you see  once inside.  There it was, my Brad Fritter looking all yunmy and stuff :).  The size was impressive and the taste was delectable.  I will be back again. Great donut shop for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is not that great coming from a person that tries a lot of different donut shops. The names of the donuts are creative named after famous actors etc and they look good but the actual donuts themselves just aren't very fresh or good tasting. My husband and I tried three different kinds, we tried a regular chocolate bar which they add their own chocolate topping on top after you order it and it was just ok. I like regular glazed chocolate on top, the donut and chocolate they added really didn't taste that good and it was a sticky mess. We tried the Elvis and a Apple pie filling donut and we were not impressed. It was like a crappy tasting donut with a store bought can of apple filling. You can just tell the quality of ingredients is very simple and not fresh. The customer service and prices were good but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their pun names for their doughnuts with celebrities names~ It's cool that it's up 24/7.  I ordered the Ellen Doughgenerous which had Fruity pebbles on top. The donut wasn't stale and taste delicious~ It was nice and soft on the inside.  My friend bought the Russel Kronut which had Bacon bits on top. She enjoyed it~ The place is nice with a retro feel."}
{"text":"Great variety, friendly staff. Doughnuts tasted great and were very fresh. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! My sticky fingers are writing this review after consuming my scrumptous donut! It has the perfect balance of donut to cream filed ratio... I had the Snoop dough-g with added butterscotch drizzle. I sware I mouthgasamed!! 
Melissa was the staff member who helped my friend and I. She was uber friendly and even joked around with us. I highly recommend this place and most definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited this location on Centennial and Simmons I had the opportunity to meet the owner. He was very nice, welcoming and even offered us a t-shirt. The donuts all have quirky names and the display of donuts makes you salivate. I was very pleased with the donuts we ordered. I even went back the next day for more."}
{"text":"The BEST donuts EVER  they are soooooo tasty and they have huge selection for any taste. I tried bacon burger that is AMAZING  and roll Mike is so TASTY 
 Vitaliy and Elena are the cutest people I have ever seen



They REALLY care about what they do 
Can't add anything else just I LOVE IT 
See my pics"}
{"text":"Changing review now that new management has taken over. I really liked it here before, but now it's even better. The owner said they make the donuts fresh a bunch of times during the day and evening, so not only does it smell great, but everything I've had has been super fresh. Most days I go the same guy is working (Daniel/David?) and he's always great about making custom stuff if I ask. The girl that works overnight is also really cool. They give student discounts, so make sure to ask about it before checkout. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"These donuts are nasty AF. Never thought I would rather eat dirt than a donut. Save you taste buds and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Used to frequent Al's Donuts before Crunch took over, they definitely hold up the quality. Although trendy they still make a damn good donut and for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"So far I can only give it two stars. And that's just because they have a decent looking website. Other than that I have no idea how they are because when my wife, daughter and I loaded into to the car to go get donuts this 24\7 place was closed. Lights off, closed. 


Update. Have now been there a few times and the donuts are amazing. Please go check them out!"}
{"text":"I'd just had an awesome dinner, but still ha room for dessert. But the clock was ticking - I needed to get home to my babysitter. This place happened to be on the way and I'd been meaning to give it a try - perfect opportunity!

Coming in, I was overwhelmed by the number of options. But the girl behind the counter was friendly and patient. After careful consideration, I opted to do one build-your-own and one cherry cream cheese fritter. 

For the build-your-own I started with a glazed donut, iced it with strawberry icing and covered it with Oreos, mini M&M's and chocolate drizzle. While I really enjoyed the flavor of the icing, over all I thought the toppings were on the skimpy side. 

However, that cherry fritter hit it out of the park! It was just the awesome, simple goodness of a fritter. And the dallop of cream cheese icing on top was the perfect combo. Honestly, I'll go back just for this!!"}
{"text":"This is not the best donut place, the donuts too small for 2.00 and dry. They are not fresh and they dont taste great. I guess our journey continues for tasty donuts close by."}
{"text":"Cute little whimsical donut shop where the concept is that you get to create your own donut. They offer a variety of flavor toppings, frostings, fillings and sprinkles. Choose from different kinds of nuts, candy, cereals like Fruity Pebbles, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Fruit Loops, and so much more. If you are pressed for time, don't despair they also offer pre-made donuts with playful and fun celebrity names. 

On this visit, I was cheerfully greeted by Cameron. A very sweet and knowledge clerk with exceptional customer service skills. He explained the process of how to place an order, and also informed me that they offer frozen custard and cupcakes. 

I went with the Katy Cherry. A name play on pop singer, Katy Perry. A decent size vanilla donut with cream cheese frosting and a cherry fruit topping. Cameron expressed that I made an excellent choice because the Katy Perry was their most popular and best selling donut. I could see why. The donut was pillowy soft, the cream cheese frosting was not too sweet and the plump cherry fruit topping was nice and tangy. Absolutely delicious! It was worth every penny of the $2.49 price tag. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of Crunch Donuts...yum!!  :D"}
{"text":"The donuts were delicious. That's really all that matters (lol). Small spot, so if you're bringing a large group, take orders in the car and send in 1 or 2 people. 

We got a dozen fancy-schmancy donuts with names like \"Katy Cherry\", \"Reeses Witherspoon\" and \"S'moregan Freeman\"  as well as a donut burger for about $25. Everything was fluffy and fresh. My personal fav was the Ellen (fruity pebbles!). The burger was off-putting, but my sister liked it. 

Staff was really slow... but all in all, it was a good experience. 

Better than Pinkbox imho."}
{"text":"The doughnuts were amazing! I tried \" THE CRUNCH\" and \" KIM KARDOUGHSHIAN \" both of them were really good, but the crunch was definitely my favorite out of the two. the pink vanilla icing tasted amazing, and the sprinkles were really good also. It's not like your normal Dunkin' Donuts or krispy cream. The dough is a lot more cake like rather than fluffy on the inside, which I personally prefer. Both of them were AMAZING. however I ordered a donut shake in the flavor \"SAMOAS HYACK\" and I was really disappointed, it wasn't really blended, and was pretty bland :( , I had high hopes for this one. Also by the time it got to my house due to ordering from UberEATS, it was a little melted. I should have just got 2 more delicious doughnuts, instead of ordering the shake. their doughnuts definitely have more flavor then their shakes. By far the best little doughnut shop in Las Vegas though a little pricey at $2.00 - $3.99 a doughnut, especially since they're pretty small. Other then that, I will definitely pay the price again for these delicious doughnuts again, next time I feel like I need to treat myself."}
{"text":"So a couple of them were good, a regular chocolate donut with nuts on top was SO stale. Overall disappointing for donuts that were $2.50 a piece. The least they could do is make them fresh. Also avoid anything with the white frosting, it has a funky taste to it. The samoas were good though, customizable concept is cool but not if it's stale....."}
{"text":"First time and last I will probably attend here due to the fact that I ordered milk and it clearly tasted expired and spoiled for sure. The donuts had no sweetness. Not the best at all"}
{"text":"I tried order through UberEats and my order was canceled on 3 separate occasions, I kept trying on different days and times because #1 the reviews says these donuts are worth it and #2 I have not found a true custard filled donut in all of Las Vegas. #3 this place was listed on UberEats as not available for almost 3 weeks after I sent a message to UberEats Customer service. I have been in the mood for and was expecting a custard style Bavarian cream filling, but was very disappointed, as these tasted like the prefab custard out of a giant plastic tub, similar to what I can get from a grocery store bakery. they were not bad donuts, per say, they just were not worth the inflated price, cutesy name puns or not. 3 fancy donuts and a burger for nearly $20, and for that price I can get 13 better tasting donuts without the hype at Pinkbox. learn how to make real custard filling, and then it might be worth over $3 a donut."}
{"text":"The donuts were delicious! Highly recommend this place. I had the Scarlett Doughhanson. A red velvet cake donut with cream cheese frosting. Dude!! Then I had the blueberry cake and it was the bizness! Check them out!!"}
{"text":"Good donuts but sadly, I didn't go on Friday so missed out on the specialty fritters.  The signature namesake Crunch donut was very good - worth the price if you are in the neighborhood.  Maybe I'm too picky but as good as the quality and innovations are, I'd pick reasonably priced, mundane donuts over these on most days."}
{"text":"Great service, not too crowded for a second breakfast! Great location and yummy donuts. Very friendly, will be returning!"}
{"text":"First time, last time. I bought 2 doughnuts and the total was $5. I had high expectations that fell short. The lemon doughnut was good. Great filling to dough ratio. The doughnut with fruity pebbles on top was HORRIBLE. The doughnut was stale, the icing was ok but the worst part was the fruity pebbles. They lost their crunch and they were soggy. I feel like it was about 2 days old, at least.
Two positives- the girl helping me was friendly and I loved funny names of the doughnut!"}
{"text":"Had the old fashioned and it tasted stale.  There seemed to be a hint of lemon in the batter.  I only stopped in because blood sugar was getting low and I'm on the run.  Didn't have a chance to say anything."}
{"text":"Horrible doughnuts we bought 5 of them an the 2 we got with bacon where just awful when we bit into it all we got was a mouth full of grease and it made me sick so I refuse to give the rest to my kids I'm sorry but don't think will be going back again"}
{"text":"It was donut day, we had to head over to the nearest donut shop from our home, I had to please my kids of course. Me not being the biggest sweet tooth I still had to give it a try and not only that this place has the coolest names on their donuts made it an even better experience for the kids. I'm glad I didn't just got to our nearest grocery store or a bigger franchise, this place was awesome!!! Donuts surprisingly very doughy and just delicious. I'm definitely a fan now. (Not good for me) ha haha 

Translation in Spanish below 

Era el día nacional donas así que teníamos que ir al local más cercano de nuestra casa. Tenía que complacer a mis hijos. Yo no siendo la más grande fan del dulce pero eso no me detuvo para probar estas donas, además este local tiene nombres muy curiosos para sus donas que convirtió en una experiencia mucho más divertida para los niños. Estoy contenta de que no fui a cualquier tienda o una franquicia más grande este lugar fue increíble y las donas sorprendentemente muy suaves y deliciosas puedo decir que soy una fan ahora (no tan bueno para mi) jajajaja"}
{"text":"Super fresh and delicious donut, cup of coffee and cozy atmosphere what else do you need to start the day just the way it should be started!"}
{"text":"Great service! The donuts are amazing. The waffles with ice cream is so good. Custom donuts, wow!!!"}
{"text":"\"It's Crunch Time\"! With some spare time on my hands and being on an empty stomach, I thought it logical that a donut from Crunch Donut Factory was in order. Located next to Roberto's on Maryland Pkwy. just across UNLV, Crunch Donuts is offering up a gourmet selection of creative donuts. Each donut has a cute name. For instance, I got the \"Whippy Goldberg\". I think all donuts are named after celebrities, with most ranging from $2-4. 

WHIPPY GOLDBERG ($2.49): A double chocolate donut with chocolate frosting and a huge dollop of whipped cream on top. The chocolate donut and frosting were great, but I wasn't too keen on the whipped cream. It was thick and super sugary. I guess I like more airy, lighter whipped cream. 4/5

The shop is super cute and modern. I definitely want to come back to try an apple fritter or two.

Recently opened in the same shopping plaza as Al's Donuts, a location directly across Maryland Parkway from the UNLV Student Union seemingly the perfect spot for 24/7 fried treats, Crunch Donut Factory brings its concept west from Arlington Texas and with clever celebrity names for each of their concoctions the results are mostly impressive.

Not exactly as 'artisan' as Donut Bar pretends, yet not as slipshod as a place like Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland, Crunch Donut Factory on Harmon Avenue splits the difference between tradition and modernity with a bevy of Cake, Yeast and Filled choices topped with simple glaze or many preconceived combinations, an added bonus offered by way of building one's own at the Crunch Creation Station.

Decorated in pink and white stripes with green detailing, each booth bearing a logo with a bizarre Donut man smiling for selfies in back, service at Crunch just prior to 6:30am on Saturday came by way of a chipper youngster, gleefully shouting greetings about Crunch Time to each patron who enters.

Perusing the glass case, Donuts fried throughout the day to replenish supply as needed, most options range anywhere from $2-$3, a cheaper-by-the-dozen-or-half deal yielding six carefully boxed rings plus a Fritter for a pre-tax cost of just thirteen dollars.

Chuckling at the seemingly nonsensical references involved in some of the choices, though Betty White makes perfect sense in the setting of a soft and rich Old Fashioned while the knockoff of Voodoo's \"Blazer Blunt\" based on Snoop Dogg proved superior to the original despite Vanilla Cream only filling a quarter of it, \"David Doughy\" was lost on me both in terms of taste as well as title as the 'yeasted' base was far too dense, particularly with the glob of unsweetened Cream Cheese filling.

Pun-infesting an Apple-heavy Fritter that could have stood to be crispier with Meet Joe Black as a whole lot of sour Citrus filled a fluffy pocket topped with Lemon frosting for Mrs. Jay-Z the best bites from Crunch Donut Factory came by way of their Cocoa-heavy Cake choices, the Marilyn Mondough accenting moist Red Velvet with Strawberry Cream while Matt Frank Dough was intense and indulgent with Darker Chocolate first shellacked in Chocolate Icing and then slathered in German Chocolate Frosting.

**** Anticipating this opening for some time, the signage replacing a Shave Ice spot several months ago, Crunch Donut Factory brings good Donuts to a neighborhood in desperate need of them, a strong competitor to Donut Mania or Pink Box with the ability to customize to ones liking presenting something entirely new to the Las Vegas area."}

Expanding out of Arlington Texas in late 2016, the first Sin City location on Harmon Avenue directly across Maryland Parkway from the UNLV Student Union, Crunch Donut Factory recently made the move to an underserved area on Simmons Street in North Las Vegas, the corner slot next to Roberto's Tacos and a popular nail salon generating plenty of foot traffic for a store similar in style to the first, complete with 'Crunchie' the Donut Man awaiting his photo-op.

Open 24/7 just like its sister store, the space a bit tighter on the inside but offering an outdoor patio with metal tables and chairs for those wishing to indulge al fresco, Crunch Donut Factory North Las Vegas sees the locally operated venture expand its selection from fried rings and stuffed pockets to a collection of freshly made Waffles and Shakes with Donuts blended in, the prices competitive to those of Pink Box, Donut Mania or the recently opened Fractured Prune with several pre-set choices plus the choice to build one's own by way of the \"Crunch Creation Station.\"

Staffed by two youngsters at the late-morning hour of eleven on a Saturday, the Grand-Opening paraphernalia still hung with flags flapping in the breeze and roadside signage alerting passers-by to a store that is not particularly visible at first glance, it was with a few other patrons making their selections that a case of thirty varieties was perused along with a small box of Fritters and Cronuts, the poster on the wall listing additional made-to-order options, plus cheaper-by-the-dozen, or half-dozen bargains.

In no way purporting to be an 'artisan' doughnuttery like many others, the majority of the choices made from a mix with square or circular bases offered in either Cake or Raised varieties, those unfamiliar with the brand will likely get a quick chuckle from names based on Pop Culture stars like Beyonce Knowles or Leonardo DiCaprio, some of them admittedly a bit of a stretch such as \"Adoughl\" which requires one to go Rolling in the Deep to establish a connection between the British musician and Vanilla Cake topped in rich Chocolate Frosting and crumbled Butterfinger pieces.

Freshly making new Donuts throughout the day, popular choices replaced as needed with most others able to be made fresh on request, it was with an $11 half-dozen of Specials plus the $1 \"Halle Strawberry\" boxed that choices were taken outside to enjoy during one of the Valley's last 70°F days, the Strawberry flavor similar to that of the classic Pink Doughnut served at Dunkin' but more natural and less sweet, a similar attribute noted in the pillowy square topped in Chocolate and chopped Nuts, though one is left a bit perplexed as to how such a pairing relates to the seemingly unflappable former First Lady.

Impressed by most of the Fruit flavors during a visit to the Harmon location, and thus investing the majority of this tasting in similar, additional picks included the \"Katy Cherry\" which placed the same base as the one before it beneath tangy Cream Cheese Frosting and a dollop of Pie filling, the typically cloying sweetness actually not so bad in this context and similarly mellowed in the case of Blueberries by the combination of a soft Cake Ring with a center piped full of Cream Cheese named after the Mississippi-born Blues legend. 

Taking a look at two 'occasional' specials to round out the tasting, both fairly sizable but not charged extra like other Donut shops in town, \"Mike's Cinnful Apple Crumb Roll\" took the idea of a Cinnamon Roll and married it to that of a Fritter by placing Apples both in the Dough as well as amidst the Streusel, the lone remaining Fritter a best-of-the-best contender thanks to the crispy exterior and soft layers of Strawberries and Dough within, a virtually greaseless creation with a sugary shellac and a spoonful of Jam adding even more flavor.

**** Store number two of what could very well be an ongoing trend, Crunch Donut Factory ups the quality of North Las Vegas fried breakfast treats in a similar way to how it did so at UNLV, the 24/7 hours probably less relevant on Simmons Street but the quality and prices exactly the same and a worthwhile place to visit for those in the area or Doughnut fans looking for something different."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cheerful feel with its pink and green decor. 

I did experience a bit of sticker shock when I spent close to $7 for only two donuts. Granted, the names of the donuts are so creative because most (if not all) are named after celebrities. Still, I should not have to pay Hollywood prices for average tasting donuts."}
{"text":"When I found this place online, i was excited to try some slightly \"outside of the line\" donuts. The combinations of flavors sounded fun on paper and they all had punny nicknames relating to celebrities. Very Vegas. 

In reality, this donut shop is nothing to go out of your way for.  Mediocre donuts in a mediocre shop in a kinda sketchy part of town.  Another donut shop (Al's Donuts)  is practically next door but I hear it's even worse. 

My suggestion: Skip this one. There are plenty of donuts in this city and there's no need to stop at this one (especially at night) hiding not-so-special donuts behind celebrity puns near the strip."}
{"text":"Just got back from my first visit to Crunch, the place was packed tonight (Friday) which is good because I need this place to stay in business because well DELICIOUS donuts! L
Alot of customers in front of me asked for all kinds of weird things...Oreo donuts...not for me. I was a tad worried my request for 6 regular chocolate bars was gonna be turned down but he said sure and had them in my hand 1 minute later. They are fantastic....keep it up Crunch, I can see this as a place classic car guys pick for a Sunday morning cruise in on the weekends...."}
{"text":"o just say.....I should have listened to all the bad reviews. 

1) it said they are open 24/7 but upon string at 5:45pm there was a sign that they were closed until 6pm 

2) the gentleman who I later found out was the owner unlocked the door and didn't invite us in as he saw me with me two kids 

3) walked in and he was busy on his laptop to even acknowledge us

4) majority of what's on their menu was not available. I understand they said they don't have all bc each day bakers but majority unavailable is a little weird especially for a donut shop that's supposedly open 24/7

I ordered 2 dozens. 1 dozen of just the original glazed known as \"Justin Timberglazed\" and the other dozen with 3 each of Blue Carrey, Choc Carter, Halle Strawberry and Buttermilk Bars. I also ordered 1 Russel l Kronut which is the maple syrup and bacon style. 

I was really excited to each my kronut. I love kronuts and I love the maple syrup bacon flavors! First bite, DISGUSTING! Kronut was stale and doughy and the bacon was thick and  chewy. I'm sorry Kronuts are suppose to be fluffy and crispy. Bacon is suppose to be crispy!


I also tried the Blue Carrey and it was ok. I just took one bite though. Blueberry flavor was there but again doughy.

I don't recommend this place and indefinitely wouldn't be back. Like I said I should have listened to the reviews but I was asked to pick up donuts and unfortunately this was the only one in the area that was \"open\" at that time."}
{"text":"Ive been here 2x and Im sad to say the donuts were stale and flavorless and expensive, esp. considering how they tasted. The donuts look good and the owners have a cool concept( ie make/ decorate ur own donuts) but if the donuts arent fresh, whats the point?"}
{"text":"Donuts were pretty and it's a cute shop with really nice people working it BUT the donuts did not taste fresh. My daughter still enjoyed her donut but I didn't care for mine so I doubt I go back unless I can find out when donuts are freshest there and then give them another try"}
{"text":"I very much believe there the best doughnuts I ever had ...so soft delicious and with funny names ... I truly wish they open a location in Summerland they will make a killing"}
{"text":"Glad to see we finally have a decent donut shop in our area! Great donuts! Build a bar donuts for the kids to create their own unique donuts! Definitely worth a visit and I will be coming back, but earlier because these are so good, they sell out quick. So get here early."}
{"text":"Great variety of donuts and kronuts. The Golden Knight donut is very good. My new favorite donut place"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype don't waste your time or money. They don't taste fresh at all. Way too overpriced and they smash all the donuts in a little box."}
{"text":"Amazing about sums it up! Food for fat asses! Doughnut shakes and bacon topped donuts! Like I said AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Everyone is in their pajamas and I say, load up boys! It's Crunchtime! Naturally, they had no idea what I meant and thought we had to rush out the door for something. 

We arrived to an empty store. The boys were excited because donuts were the last thing they expected and twas all mommy's idea? Okay, let me add...it was close to bedtime annnnnnnd on a school night. I'm such a rebel. Lol. The casings were certainly not short of donuts. Lots of fun Hollywood inspired names, large menus to the left, and cronuts featuring in their own case, and a topping bar.

We entered with no one to greet us. But, it didn't take long before the owner came out from the back. He seemed friendly, yet, I could tell his mind was running with all kinds of tasks. There were times I coudnt understand what he was saying because he had this sort of rushing mumble. So I pretended I understood the words that was xoming out his mouth. As I ordered everyone's donuts he said, good choice they just got done cooking. But at the point I wasn't sure what donut he was referring to?

We ordered a samoa, sheryl cronut, Brad fritter, Taylor crisp, and a Mike something...which is simply a chocolate cake donut (named after the owner), and a Justin timber glaze which is just a glazed yeast donut. The samoa is what we all know of a samoa in terms of cookies, etc...my husband didn't like it. Absurd as he lovvvves him some samoa and is a coconut enthusiast. He noted a couple times how it kept tasting like a lemon donut and the coconut was more like a mirage in flavor. 

My eldest had a Brad fritter which is basically an apple fritter. I picked it up from the box to serve it to him and it was pretty hot. However, hot may seem like a good thing but this was more like heating up an old donut, melting it's glaze, to mask the oldness of it. I picked it up and it was limp in the middle. Then I wondered, is this what he meant by just cooked? Because i'm pretty sure he stepped away to warm it up. I wish he hadn't. It was a terrible idea for that donut. My son said nothing which meant he wasn't thrilled. He will always say something if tis good.

My other son had the Taylor crisp. Vanilla frosted cake donut with cinnamon toast crunch! I love that cereal, so I had to catch a bite. Love the idea but the donut itself was dry. 

I had the sheryl cronut, now I'm no cronut connoisseur but this cronut did not disappoint or bum me out. It was a tad sweet for my liking, but I enjoyed it. A cronut with apple filling, vanilla icing, and then topped with more apple. The croissant was not dry, and actually THIS cronut tasted like it was just cooked minus the warmness. 

The just timberglaze and the husband's Mike cake  donut are the dollar donuts as they are just regular yeast and cake donuts. I wasn't impressed by them and think the cake and yeast donuts from smiths bakery are way better. The hubs enjoyed the chocolate icing, which probably doesn't mean much because he has a chocolate weakness.

None-the-less, it's always fun to have a fun donut shop in this area. I'm always a fan of such spots that make their way on this end. We would certainly come back for a treat, but will probably come earlier in the morning versus later in the night to see if that'll cure our minor gripes. 

I thought the inside would feel fresh and rejuvenated since it is occupying what was Tiabi...but, between the wobbly table, seating that doesn't look new, a paint job that seemed rushed to me, it didnt. It actually felt like it has been there much longer than Tiabi was.

Patio seating available but beware because when we were there the trash outside was overflowing, is located right near the entrance, so if you're enjoying the outdoor and the garbage is flowing out, you may feel torn between the bite of sweetness from your donut and the bite of funk making its way to your nose. 

Anyway, definitely kid friendly (duh). There isn't much space in there, but you could surely fit a stroller in there. If it's busy, the line could definitely create a full room.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The wait is ridiculous... 1/2 hr over just for a dozen donuts.. this thing better be worth it.. No go!! Walked out!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious . Most of the donuts are pretty delicious , they are a little bit pricey but hey it's a 24 hour donut shop! Recently I tried the Elvis waffle and it was delicious!!! If you like peanut butter and bananas , I highly recommend this sweet treat."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! The donut names are so cute and creative! Taylor Crisp, Kim Kardoughshian! That's what drew me in but after the donuts themselves are delicious! I went at two in the morning and the lady made the donuts fresh for my boyfriend and I! They're so nice, I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out. Im glad they have this location in north LV cause i really hate having to go to the strip.  I got nearly one of each doughnut, whatever was available. But of course i had to make sure that I got the Dough Wayne Johnson, cause i heart The Rock. 
The cake donuts were meh...some of the frostings on a few of them were gross and left like a wax like film in your mouth, it was weird.  The cronuts and donuts (the non cake ones) were probably worth it.  I think the coolest part of this joint was the Create Your Own Doughnut bar.  We don't have anything like that where I live in California.  A little pricey for the size of donuts you get though.  I'm used to the monster sized donuts that i get here in my hometown in Cali."}
{"text":"They're open 24 hours and have delicious donuts. The Katy cherry is my fave. It is a bit pricey, but good. They also have donut shakes and a flavor your own donut station. Service is fast & friendly."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. My sister and I stopped in later in the evening because we found it on yelp and it sounded so cute and yummy. The names of the donuts we so cute and they looked good in the case even though the selection was very very poor. We settled on the 4 out of 6 choices and shared. We ended up have a bite each of the 4 and that was it. They were all stale. They were definitely not as good as they looked. We were mad that we wasted our money, and they weren't cheap. We probably should've asked for our money back but were too tired to hassle it. Wouldn't go back :("}
{"text":"The creativity behind the menu is impressive. 

Katy Cherry? Kim Kardoughsian? I mean, c'mon. They have lots of donuts, waffles, milkshakes. They even have a burger on the menu with a donut bun. The space is wild and colorful and there is plenty of seating.

I am convinced I love donuts until I order them and realize I only eat a few bites. I like donuts and I liked Crunch Donut Factory, I just didn't love it. 

We stopped in mid-day and noticed Crunch is open 24 hours. Not sure when or how often they are baking, but the donuts didn't taste fresh The space was also looking a little neglected and needed a good wipe down for how slow it was. 

I will say that I loved the Katy Cherry. A yeast square donut topped with a ring of cheesecake and a cherry filling. I'm a sucker for anything cheesecake and anything cherry. Out of the four we ordered, it was my only favorite. The flavors of the signature Crunch and Lemony Snicket were very artificial and the donuts were very dry. I was most looking forward to the Taylor Crisp (for obvious reasons *ahem, my name*) but was so sad that the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal was totally stale. 

The staff seemed pleasant enough and one of the patrons assured me that I could look like him if I ordered a dozen. We both had a good chuckle as he rubbed his belly.

It might have to be a late night before I return to Crunch, but I have high hopes for this creative group."}
{"text":"This place is so cool they make donut shakes !!! Donut sandwiches and waffles I will be fat by next week lol"}
{"text":"Really very tasty  donuts.                                        Great service..                             Thanks.                                                                            I 'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering from Crunch, The first time, was great, but this time wasn't the best. I don't know if we ordered to close to closing time but a couple of the doughnuts were very dense and dry, also had minimal toppings.
The Leonardo oreo one was very dry and dense,
The Adoughl one looked amazing with Butterfinger bits on top. Again, had minimal toppings and was very dry.
The Sheryl Krognut was extremely delightful, flakey layers filled with Apple cinnamon, just delicious. The Nutshell Doughbama was nice, not completely overwhelming but likeable.
I did fancy the Angelina jelly, it's like eating a pb&j
I'll definitely buy from here again with hopes of only getting fresh, fluffy treats that look beautiful:)"}
{"text":"I took my nephew to work this morning and as I was driving by on my way to work I noticed this Donut shop, even though it was really early and sorta scary there I stopped in to buy some. The young lady that helped me was very pleasant and helpful!!! Let me tell you all the donuts I bought were simply amazing. If it wasn't in a weird location I would stop by more often. But they are on Bite Squad as well!"}
