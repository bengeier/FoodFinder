{"text":"We went on a Friday night and thanks to their renovation and added tables, there was virtually no wait time to be seated. The menu offers a fair amount of options-- I might even say too many, as some of the salads and bowls really have only one omition or addiction of ingredients separating them, making it somewhat redundant.  I'm vegan and it really seemed as though the two non-vegans who dined with me were more keen on the food than I was. My perception of Aux Vivres is that it's basically another trendy, Plateau hipster haunt that's geared towards capitalising on the vegan craze, targeting non-vegans more than vegans themselves.  I don't tend to cook with tons of seitan, TVP, tofu, tempeh, etc., nor do many other vegans I know, and yet most of their meals are laden with them. Fresh produce and inventive use of veggies (plus a chia seed there or a nut here) are more than enough to create an appetizing vegan meal. My veggie burger and fries were extremely, extremely heavy. The fries were more like soft slabs of potato than crispy French fries.  My two friends split a bowl (Dragon, I believe) and a BLT. The BLT was drenched in sauce and wasn't a taste I particularly enjoyed from the bite I had. I won't hurry back to the restaurant despite its relatively good service due to its overhyped, overpriced and under spiced food."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to or pass through Montreal, I have to stop here for their BLT on chipati. Smoked coconut, lettuce, tomato and (vegan?) mayonnaise. It's incredible. My one regret the last time I was there (last Sunday), that I didn't buy a BLT to go."}
{"text":"Smoothies here (Banana Blast with a touch of cocoa for me and Blue Monkey/Tropicana tries for the girlfriend) are delicious treats. They should not be passed up.  The food is equally wonderful. Healthy, filling portions of quality vegan ingredients. The salad was huge and colorful. I added coconut bacon from the BLT to it. Great choice. Girl got the Buddha bowl and enjoyed it. We came back again for sandwiches and shared half-each of the Dragon and Mekong sandwiches. Lovely food. Although it's on the pricier than bang-for-the-buck side, it's not enough to detract from a five-star rating in my book. They're open till 11pm on weeknights: THANK you. :)"}
{"text":"A friend took me to this great vegan restaurant.  I had Buddha bowl and celery smoothie. The meal is very refreshing, tasty and creative. One of the best meals I had in Montreal."}
{"text":"A large very creative selection of vegetarian friendly food! Me and my friend ordered the Dragon rice bowl and a Chana wrap. The Dragon rice bowl was a little complicated for my tastes, (But thats completely  at the fault of me for ordering it, since I knew what I was getting) But I still really enjoyed all the fresh tasty vegetables on it. But WARNING: Those rice bowls could feed a family, if you're thinking about sharing it instead of ordering two, sharing would be the better option. The Chana was warm flavorful and something I could eat again and again. Plus they have a lovely selection of pastries which I have to go back to try!   OMG I almost forgot about the service too. It was so incredibly fast. My friend and I went to the restroom and when we came back the food was already at our places. It must have been less than 5 minutes. I've never had service so fast. The waitresses were also very smily and helpful when we were having troubles with the credit card machine. :D Great restaurant! If you're a vegetarian its a must!"}
{"text":"This review is only about the cheesecake, which is amazing. Not dense, it's a fluffy cheesecake and had a really delicious berry topping. Sure it's $6, but it's a heaping helping."}
{"text":"We had the dragon and Buddha bowls. They were very good but as other reviewers have mentioned, rely on sauces instead of more flavorful ingredients.  No kids menu.  Fried potatoes were dry."}
{"text":"Oh I wanted so badly to give this place five stars! The food was magical. It was the best carrot cake of my life, no question. But the server did not check in, except to order our dessert, and did not even bring a water refill once, not even when I asked for one. Otherwise a wonderful dining experience. The latke burger is crazy good!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in all of Canada, and perhaps all of North America, and that said... probably the world. Okay, yes, this is my new favorite restaurant in the world.  Thank you for making me a vegan Gyro with Tzatsiki to die for everyday I was in Montreal. I know it was on the menu, but I feel like somehow the item was placed there with me in mind because everyday I go in, there seems to be yet another with my name on it and no matter how much I try to believe that my mind is a unique separate instance of cognizance, isolated from the universe, this sandwich is proof that someone out there knows me and my innermost thoughts, desires, hopes and dreams, and loves me enough to feed it to me, rather than using it against me as some form of sick torture like I would expect from an investigator into my psyche from some other, lesser creator, some sad restaurant that is not you. Yes, you are benevolence incarnate.   It's you, Aux Vivres. It's always been you. You complete me.  Blessings to you beautiful Aux Vivres!"}
{"text":"Every believer of staff made us feel every one of special and was attentive. It was a in fact customary dining experience to be repeated."}
{"text":"This is a solid vegan place.i love checking their specials and the breakfast burrito in their to go store is one of the absolute best.  They're worth checking out for brunch too!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty for vegan. I ventured out to Aux Vivres early on a Thursday (6pm) to be sure to get a spot as this resto always looks full!  My friends ordered the Thai bowl and I ordered the Dragon bowl.  I think mine definitely looked tastier.  In any case, they were all a pretty good portion and you will definitely feel full after.  Too bad because those Energy Balls they had for dessert looked really tempting."}
{"text":"Montreal's filled with beautiful people speaking a beautiful language, so after soundcheck at La Sala Rossa we decided to walk down St-Laurent, taking in the sites and possibly some dinner.  We spotted a VEGAN place across the street that looked real healthy and the clientele was nothing short of bonny, so we took a booth.  THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!  If yer touring through Montreal, you MUST eat here.   So many good things on the menu and they're all made with some serious love.  The wait staff is super pretty and nice too...   Giancarla had the Dragon Bowl and thought it was \"excellent.\" She felt the cabbage and the carrots and the sauce that came with it were \"so fresh\" and not \"vegetabl-ey.\"  She went on to say, \"the dressing was real yummy and the rice on the bottom had some sort of sauce,...I didn't know what it was, but loved it anyway.\"  Sondre had the Buddha Bowl and states, \"I come from this with a perspective of someone who's not a vegetarian or vegan, but I like exploring and I thought it looked like a great establishment and I was VERY impressed.  I'd say it was Ace. I felt very good about the meal and I'd never had tofu like that before.  [the tofu] Tasted so good.  And the healthy portion of broccoli is always a plus.  You know me, I'm not big on dressings and dips and all that shit, but this sauce was perfect.  The stuff on the rice was super good and I liked all those pumpkin seeds.  It felt like a full, hearty, and healthy meal.\"  As for me, I had the Thai Bowl and was real happy with all the carrots, those big stems of bok choy, the brown rice, the peanut sauce, and tofu, but I must say, If I were to do it all over again, I'd go with the Buddha Bowl.  I was so jealous of all that broccoli!  (Luckily, Sondre was kind enough to share)  The Bowls are definitely big enough to share or take half home for the van ride later, so keep that in mind when yer planning ahead to your post-show-midnight-meal.    All 3 of us got the fresh juices and were blown away. Sondre and Giancarla got the TONIC (Apple, Lemon, Ginger) which was super spicy and made them feel like it was immediately working on repairing the throat and boosting their sinus immunity.  A+!   I was elated to drink the (Apple, Carrot, Beet) juice cuz I know Beets are so good for me. Health...in a glass.  Sondre even went nuts an ordered a fancy green tea on top of all that (for his pipes).  He was in a decadent beverage heaven, of which, he'd make a solitary promise to re-visit as often as possible through the consumption of fresh and healthy juices around the country; or die trying.  (at least that's what his expression supposed)  We didn't have time to eat dessert, but I can't imagine it'd be anything less than \"fett.\"  GO EAT HERE!!!!  ~Dave \"Herremannen\" Heilman"}
{"text":"This is by far the best vegan restaurant I have ever been to. Not only is the food delicious and the menu varied but the environment is inviting and friendly.  The clientele is a nice mix of families and punks and hippies you would expect at a vegan place.  The menu is deep enough that it requires multiple visits!   It's in a great part of the city so if you haven't explored that neighborhood yet it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great vegan restaurant. Try the Popeye beverage with the pollenta dish."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere. We ordered a breakfast plate and a smoked coconut BLT (loved it!). Even though the portions are huge, my husband actually ate two of the breakfast platters, one right after the other, and really impressed the waitress.   We had to wait awhile to get a table, but the service was friendly (if not super fast) and bilingual. I remember the restaurant being kind of noisy, but I'm glad it's so popular.  I would definitely go to Aux Vivres again if visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I live the food here... I even crave it. I always have the BLT on chapati and the dragon bowl with tofu. I have seen this restaurant go from a small business to a full blown money Nanking restaurant. The I Lu thing that bothers me is that they are constantly raisin their prices... The food used to be made fresh and seemed to be made with live and now it seems to be mass produced and the quality is going down a bit. I will continue to go there until either the price becomes unaffordable or when I just stop craving the food. But I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone even non vegetarian people can eat here and learn how to eat tasty healthy foods."}
{"text":"They have very tasty fake cheesecake I always take their special of the day and it's always good. Very fast and good service"}
{"text":"You really do not have to be vegan to enjoy this restaurant. They serve a delicious healthy brunch!"}
{"text":"Astonishingly great!! The Dragon sauce with Dragon Tempeh bowl is so fresh & fantastic! I do enjoy a good steak once in a while but this food will make you feel like your glowing from the inside.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"J'ai découver Aux vivres lors de mon passage à Montréal en juin dernier. Je ne suis pas végétarienne mais une yelpeuse qui aime découvrir des nouveaux endroits (surtout quand on en dit que du bien!).  Ma moitié qui était avec moi voulait tout de même se mettre un morceau de viande sous la dent avant d'aller retrouver nos amis. Finalement c'est le ventre vide qu'il est arrivé Aux Vivres et qu'il en ressorti le ventre bien rempli et heureux d'avoir découvert une nouvelle cuisine.   Les desserts sont à tomber. Le faux-mage est juste extra et franchement, végétalien ou pas, il a un goût de vrai cheesecake (peut-être un peu plus consistant).  Le seul gros point négatif c'était la serveuse hardcore qui venaient toutes les 30 secondes nous demander si tout était ok. Si elle avait pu lécher la table, elle l'aurait fait! Elle était tellement limite qu'à la fin du repas, elle nous a sorti le couplet sur le pourboire en se mettant presque à genoux et cela, sans se douter qu'elle parlait à des personnes qui vivaient à MTL depuis plus d'un an.  Pas de réservation alors, arrivez tôt! Très tôt!"}
{"text":"Ambiance très relaxe et sympathique!  C'est vraiment un bon endroit pour aller découvrir de nouvelles recettes originales végétariennes/vegan! La découverte qui m'a le plus épaté est le sandwich BLT à la noix de coco, vraiment délicieux et excellent mélange de saveurs! Définitivement un endroit à essayer pour tous!"}
{"text":"Pretentious, boring, contradictory.    Their menu totes \"freshest ingredients, giving priority to local and seasonal produce, to create surprising flavour combinations and unusual dishes that you won't find anywhere else.\"    This statement is a stretch by any means, I have been to many vegan and vegetarian restaurants, that have blown my mind with unique and innovative cooking. This is not one of them.   Tofu and tempeh burgers are a dime a dozen. As are asian fusion bowls but not with the hefty price tag of 13 to 15 dollars, for a veggy bowl.  What is local or seasonal about daikon, dulce or wakame?   Let's be honest about what this restaurant truly is; it does not cater to much of the vegan crowd, because most vegans wouldn't pay the inflated prices for things they could easily make at home.  Most vegans and vegetarians have had their share of tofu and tempeh burgers, if not a few hundred veggie bowls.   Therefore, lets truthfully admit that this restaurant caters to the curiosity of non vegan and vegetarians offering trendy fare at a price.   The staff were rather aloof, and had us standing at the host station for 10 minutes, while looking over a virtually empty restaurant. Furthermore when we were seated by who we thought to be our server, she said nothing to us and walked away from the table after seating. She then returned  with a bottle of water (for 3 of us)filling our glasses with water and walked away. 20 min later our glasses were empty and we were still waiting to order. When we finally made eye contact with one of the other employees behind the juice bar(who was leisurely chatting with other staff behind the bar), the original host/server finally came over and begrudgingly  took our order. After our food arrived our water glasses remained empty ( we think that they only allowed us one bottle of water because they expected us to buy drinks, such as $4.50 for 8oz of juice) and no one came to check on us to see if the food or order was to our satisfaction. To top it off the server had forgotten to bring a bowl of soup, but didn't realize.  Then another sever showed up at the table with soup in hand after we had already finished our meal.  After asking him to pack it to go, he returned with the bill and has the audacity to start chatting us up, almost as thought he was hoping to get a good tip. WTF?!  The food was satisfactory, but all in all the place left a bad taste in our mouths and a hole in our wallets."}
{"text":"We visited aux vivres three times in one week because we loved the food, concept, and service. This would have been a five star review however our first visit was a deal breaker. The hostess took our name and said it wouldn't be long. She took the names of three French speaking couples behind us and sat them before us. She even gave us a smug look as she was doing it. To the owner... so sorry for the one star but we are restaurant professionals who know blatant contempt when we see it. Not sure what her problem with us was other then that we did not speak French. We try to come to Montreal every summer so perhaps after our next visit, if your host staff treats us fairly, you'll get the five stars you deserve.  Update, looks like we're not going to get to Montreal this year. Here's the five stars you deserve. That hostest is probably long gone by now."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal. Big portions, good price. It's not the classiest joint, but it's easy and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Ate here over the weekend, had the Le Complet, it was awesome.  Only gripes are that the service was too slow and their cheesecake was kinda vile."}
{"text":"Outstanding fresh, healthy food. The kind of meal you feel great after eating. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a salad or brown rice dish with a tasty sauce."}
{"text":"This was the first vegan restaurant in Montreal and I was super surprised to learn that it was the best food I tried during my weekend visit there! It has not only provided an example for other health/compassionate establishments, but it has kept up the pace as more competition appears in the vegan resto realm. Service was fabulous. Huge portions with beautifully displayed meals, a late brunch (score!), lots of protein (tempeh!) options, and delicious, DELICIOUS ingredients and bites. I wanted to eat here every day (and almost did). There are lots of options including juices, big salads, veggie bowls, and more. I had the blueberry pancakes and it even came with a chai latte. If you are vegan, or even open-minded, you MUST go here - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food, and smoothies! The pancakes for brunch and bowls for dinner are amazing! Deserts and especially cheese cake are awesome!"}
{"text":"Love it! I have yet to try something here that I didn't like.   My personal favourite meal here is the mekong wrap with a creamsicle smoothie. Delicious. Corn bread with guac is a solid starter.   One thing I always find bizarre though, is that when ever I upgrade from bread to the chapati wrap, the wraps are in fact just made of pita. This has happened several times. Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm pretty sure that chapatis and pitas are not generally considered to be one and the same. Note to Aux Vivres chefs/menu-makers, if you are reading this: Miriam Webster defines 'chapati' as \"a round flat unleavened bread of India that is usually made of whole wheat flour and cooked on a griddle\". Just thought you should know.    The chana 'chapati' is also very good, though can get pretty soggy (again, this may be because it is in a pita, not a chapati).   Personally, I enjoy sitting at the counter (or anywhere on the lefthand side of this place), but hey, it's all good."}
{"text":"My first time in Mtl, and friend who lived here recommended this place. Went around noonish on a weekday and it was packed! It was just the two of us so no wait. Lovely, bright place, good service and lots of variety in the menu! We ordered the soup of the day, I think it was curry lentil, and I had the Mekong wrap/sandwich. Soup was delicious, full of flavour and not too runny, with a good consistency. The Mekong was HUGE! I got it with tempeh instead of tofu (first time trying it) and it was really good! All the flavours went really well together. Would definitely recommend it and would love to come back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Love that it's open late. Bombay Banane smoothy is the business. English and French menu. Slaw that comes with burgers is great and I don't even like slaw!  One less star because each item is at least $1.50 pricier than seems reasonable. However, I still make this a regular stop whenever I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was only in Montreal a week, but went here twice! The food is very fresh, amazing, the portions are huge, and best of all, *everything* is vegan. The first time I went, I got the buddah bowl and nectar juice (apple, carrot and beet) and my boyfriend got the seitan sandwich and the creamsicle smoothie. Everything was soooooooo wonderful!  The second time, I got the la polenta brunch, which is fried polenta, black bean refritos, guacamole, salsa & salad. I also got a side of tofu scramble and espresso. The polenta was probably the best polenta I have had in my entire life. I don't know how they prepared and breaded it so perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the faux lox sanwich on chapati bread and a cafe frappe. All of that was delicious. My boyfriend also got soup, which wasn't memorable. We also shared cheesecake, which was excellent. We always have to take advantage of vegan desserts.   The prices are well worth it for what you get.  To those who complained about the service, maybe you should stay in America. I recommend Red Robin, where they're up your a-- every 5 minutes."}
{"text":"La bouffe est plutôt bonne.  Pourquoi deux étoiles ? - Pas d'alcool. - Des mouches partout."}
{"text":"My friends and I are vegetarians that enjoy trying interesting vegan fare. We ordered a Thai bowl, Mexicali plate and the Dragon Wrap. The wrap was rather bland and tasted very raw, but the Thai bowl and Mexicali plate were flavorful and filling. The atmosphere inside the restaurant didn't seem that nice, but we ate outdoors in the back patio area which was very cute and relaxing. The menu is offered in both English and French, which turned out well for us since we don't know a lick of French. Overall an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, nor a vegetarian, but I love me some Aux Vivres.   I find it really difficult to find restaurants that give you large quantities of cooked leafy greens in Montreal, unless we're talking about Chinese food. But Aux Vivres does just that in their rice bowls, particularly the Thai and Macro options.   I make it a point to have a meal here every time I'm in Montreal. I initially came for the chapati wrapped sandwiches (especially the CLT, duh!), but since finding out about a gluten intolerance, I also really appreciate that Aux Vivres makes it very clear which items are g-free on their menu.   Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I ordered the Thai bowl with smoked coconut on the side. My boyfriend ordered the Sirocco and a salad. The food came quickly, the service was great, and we didn't feel rushed. The dressings and sauces were very unique and tasty... and I liked the light marinade they used on my tofu.   I keep on wanting to try their desserts, but I just keep on getting too full from my main dishes! Until next time, Aux Vivres!"}
{"text":"We are in town from Virginia for a few nights, traveling with our 3 kids, ages 12, 9, and 4. My husband and I are vegetarians, but our kids love meat whenever possible. We decided upon this cute little vegan spot based on reviews and proximity to our VRBO condo. It didn't disappoint.   We ordered gyro, Portabello burger, a Thai tofu bowl special, chili, cornbread, and humus. Ingredients were fresh. Portions huge. Nobody left hungry, but we all felt healthy. Our 9 year old couldn't believe there was no meat in his chili (and he loved it!)  Highly recommended for healthy, tasty, family-friendly meal."}
{"text":"Nice vegan fast food-style restaurant. It was very busy but we got a table right away and the service was friendly and quick. I had the portobello burger, which was very nice. I was maybe a bit disappointed because I had expected an actual burger but it was really just a portobello mushroom on bread. The potato wedges and accompanying salad were delicious. My partner liked her assiette Kosmos. The only downside was that it was very loud in the restaurant (including the music), which didn't make for the most relaxing meal."}
{"text":"The food is delish. It is rare to find good vegetarian/vegan food and this place served it up for sure. Although I have noticed the prices sneaking up of late the food is still worth it.  And yes the coconut bacon BLT Wrap with vegan mayo IS that good.  There hasn't been anything ordered that I didn't enjoy, and that includes the bites I have stolen off of my friend's plates :) kudos to the cooks.  I recommend: Veggiepâté Chili BLT wrap Buddah Bowl the Soupe du Jour is usually bangin' the Brownies are yum and so is the Chocolate/banana Pie  Staff is bilingual which is bonus and they accept cash/debit and CC.   Downside? Holy lineups Batman!   To be fair the first few times weren't too bad and the staff were friendly, however last time we waited for almost an hour to be seated (no exaggeration). Granted we were a group of  7, not as easy to seat, but I feel that with better seating management and planning this could have been avoided. People with only 2 or 3 were constantly given priority over us and then there was a couple who walked right by the line of about 15 people, went up to the hostess whom they obviously knew, and were immediately seated at a table that was just cleared. When we were seated they tried to fit us at a 4-seater table even though the table next to us was free. So we pulled it over and made it work, which noticeably pissed the waitress off and would explain the extra slow service and attitude we got that night.  As soon as we got our food though all was forgiven... or at least forgotten :)   And yes I do plan on returning, several times, although I will probably avoid going in a larger group and Thurs-Sat evenings. Or evenings period. Come to think of it take out is prob best."}
{"text":"I've lived here about a year and this place is so far my favourite Montreal food - and I'm not vegan.   You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches but my faves are the Mekong and the BLT (with roasted coconut as a bacon replacement - YUM).  Also the chocolate cake is to die for.    Service-wise very good and fast.  They are especially great about keeping water cups filled and replenishing you table pitcher of water.  I love that they have a separate side for to-go orders too, so the two are not competing service wise."}
{"text":"I was told ahead of time that Aux Vivres was the first and is still the most popular vegan restaurant in Montreal. Being vegetarian, I had to try it!   I was not disappointed. The place is fairly easy to get to and there are enough options to suit even the pickiest eater. The place was packed (with silly hipsters) when I got there. Unfortunately I didn't get to eat much, but I did get the chilli, and it was delicious! The drinks looked really good, and a lot of people near me were getting dessert, but I was already full...next time. Also, the staff are really nice here. Definitely try it out if you want quality comfort food."}
{"text":"The day they started selling dragon sauce in a bottle is the day I expressed my joy in song: 'O Happy Day'!!!  When start to run out of dragon sauce at home, my head starts to hurt... And the faux-mage cheesecake? Heaven on a fork!!  I will go to this restaurant again, and again, and again, and again..."}
{"text":"Terrible service and totally unoriganized. The waitress was randomly pick customer to serve instead of seating customer in order. The food is very average, but i guess there is really not much vegan places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Uninspired overpriced vegan food. I cannot believe they got rid of the rye bread. RIP rye bread"}
{"text":"This post will be like most other on here, I'm going to sing the praises of the aux vivres BLT, it's simply the best sandwich I've ever had. I will say that I have almost perfect this sandwich myself all that's off is the chapatti bread, I can't seem to make it the same way. The coconut bacon, has a smokey, sweet and salty flavour, as well as a slightly greasy aspect to it because of the fat in coconut. The secret to that sandwich is the vegan butter sauce that they spread on the chapatti before applying the vegan mayo, Bacon, lettuce and tomato.    I've also tried there new breakfast burrito, it's great, a generous portion plus a coffee or tea for 5$. Other items I've had include, the portobello burger, the channa wrap, veggie lox, the veggie pate, chilli, faux cheese cake, choco banana pie, many smoothies and fresh juices.    I've been here 20+ times in the past 3-4 years, I've never had a bad meal, the only thing I hate about going to aux vivres is when my meal comes to an end, I just never want to leave.   I've been a vegetarian for about 8 years and   I'm trying to be a vegan, this restaurant makes it that much easier."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal!! And the service!!  The server was so kind, and informative. He wasn't vegan but had amazing suggestions for my non vegan friends.  The burgers were all delicious!!! I was very impressed!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great vegan food, good service. I liked the soup du jour.  For true vegans, this is a real find, so I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant végétarien. J'y retournerais volontiers.  Le service était adéquat et accueillant. Un repas santé avec de bonnes proportions. J'ai hâte d'y essayer d'autres plats."}
{"text":"Sans doute l'un des meilleurs restaurants pour se familiariser à la cuisine végétalienne (aucun produit ou sous-produit animal). Aux vivres propose un riche menu coloré et inspiré de plusieurs cultures du monde (Mexique, Inde, Liban, Thaïlande, etc.) Ceux qui croient encore au mythe que la cuisine végétalienne n'est point bourrative, venez faire un tour ici; le personnel décontracté vous servira des portions toutes autant généreuses qu'inventives.  En entrée, je vous conseille le dahl; il est particulièrement réussi. Ça se corse lorsque vient le temps de choisir son repas principal. C'est qu'on hésite surtout entre les « Bols » ou les Burgers. Les bols sont des ramassis de nature, accompagnés d'une sauce. Le bol thaï est un franc délice : bok choi à la vapeur, carottes et daïkons marinés, coriandre avec une addictive sauce aux arachides. Le tout est servi sur du riz brun avec du tofu grillé. Je ne suis pas trop fan de tofu, mais j'ai bien aimé celui-là!.. Surprise!  C'est un grand restaurant doté, imaginez-vous, d'un large bar à jus!... Essayez le Creamsicle, un mélange parfait de lait de coco, jus d'orange, de carotte, vanille et sucre bio... Le tonique est assez efficace aussi : pomme, citron, gingembre. Simple et bon. Pour le bonheur de caféïnomanes, du véritable café équitable est offert ( allant du filtre jusqu'au frappé au lait de soya). Sans oublier l'immanquable Kombucha, presque devenu un symbole tendances de bien-être au naturel. Au moins, ça ne fait de mal à personne...  - Parmi les oeuvres d'art affichées sur les murs (elles sont à vendre), l'on y retrouve une magnifique toile de hiboux..."}
{"text":"I've been here around ten times by now. Every time I have been blown away but the quality of the food (service sometimes leaves a little to be desired, but they do their best). Get the dragon bowl... It's like the vegan answer to Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"This is a delicious restaurant. Whatever-tarian you are, you will ENJOY this restaurant... The food just TASTE AMAZING.   What I like about Aux Vivres:  - Delicious, fresh and creative menu - Good smoothies - Beautiful presentation - Reasonable prices - Veggies, veggies, veggies!!! - Real good portions - It is always crowded (more people in there=more healthy people!) - Colors, health and quality!!!   What I like less:  - The \"plain\" service (it's fine, it's just not super friendly) - Could be hard to park if you have a car.  /////////////////////////   I am in love with the \"Deluxe\" salad... And, must try the brunch on week-ends; the polenta is yummmmy!   THANK YOU Aux Vivres!!! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! It has become a superb must for me on the regular. They make the most delicious & refreshing food and drinks- it's unbeatable for breakfast, brunch....yum!!!!!!!!!!!! go here now!!!!"}
{"text":"J'ai pris Los Huevos Rancheros. Je m'attendais à être déçue puisque je suis Mexicaine et je connais le vrai goût de ce met, mais à ma grande surprise, j'ai adoré mon repas. Les haricots avaient bon goût et gros bravo pour leur tortillas de maïs, elles étaient très bonnes, elles ne goûtaient pas le conservateur, une des meilleures tortillas que j'ai mangées à Montréal. Le prix est très abordable et c'est sur que je reviens!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dragon bowl! So happy to have fresh, flavorful and healthy food after two weeks of indulging on vacation. It was so good it still felt indulgent! Great spot for vegetarians or anyone wanting to have a good for you meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and fresh. Creative and really well executed menu and nice staff. Worth the trip from anywhere."}

{"text":"The first time i came in i had a most delicious greek grynos but the next time i came in their veggie burger option with fries was a disappointment-too spicy and i got a soso waiter. The meal with tip-in the end is too pricey. I remember when this restaurant was a hole i the wall and much more humane on a side street at another location now its a yuppified diner. Its hit or miss with this one."}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as I heard it was. We had a tempeh burger, which was okay at best. Not very flavorful or exciting, and the bun tasted stale or gluten-free. The potatoes that came with it weren't very tasty either. The Mumbai thali was better -- the dressing on the salad was delicious. Overall slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"Went three times in three days during our Montreal stay. Lively, friendly atmosphere in a good location. If you're vegan, AV has everything you could want. All dishes are generous and tasty. Smoothies, tea, apps, mains. The polenta plate at brunch is stellar, as are the burgers/wraps. We also loved the mezze dip app. The tzatziki is well-made, as are the potatoes. You can't go wrong. AV presents and constructs solid, nutritious and delicious food. We learned about the shop/take-out side the day we left -- they do a great job there, too."}
{"text":"Staff are calm, attentive and not over bearing. Food was fast but it was just a salad so cannot judge. The Dragon Salad was delicious! $12. Brown rice was tasty and a good soy and sesame vinaigrette but I was left a little hungry ( just a bit more vegetables) and the grilled tofu could of been marinated for flavour or seasoned and cooked more than the mere scorch line it bore. Overall a great spot for a Sunday light supper that seems to attract all ilk."}
{"text":"One of my favorite vegan place in Montreal.. Big menu with a lot of options!! The BLT wrap is sooo good!!! If you are for the brunch...try Los Huevos Rancheros."}
{"text":"Prices double every year. I miss the old pre-macdonalized aux vivres. Still good dragon bowl if in a pinch but not what it was."}
{"text":"Hier j'ai eu une envie soudaine de boire un bon jus frais. Ayant déjà entendu parler des jus Aux Vivres, j'ai convaincu mon chum de faire un détour pour aller m'en chercher un. J'ai pris le Popaye. Un bon jus vert pleins de vitamine !! Miammmmmmm...ce fût un délice dans ma bouche :-) J'y retourne c'est sûr pour essayer la nourriture la prochaine fois !! J'ai entendu dire que le bol du dragon est à essayer absolument car la sauce dragon est plus que délicieuse."}
{"text":"Même si je suis une carnivore, j'adore passer à ce resto pour les jours où je n'ai pas envie de manger de viande.   Je vous suggère fortement le burger de Tempeh!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but the service was very slow. I went for brunch on a Sunday and was able to sit down pretty quickly. First course came out fast. We ordered food to go when we ordered our breakfast, but waited an excessively long period of time to get our to go order, and then waited even longer to get our check. But the staff was extremely friendly and the prices were very reasonable considering the large portions given."}
{"text":"No soy vegetariana y sin embargo este es uno de mis restaurantes favoritos para una comida informal en el Plateau. Después de haberlos probado todos, los mejores boles son, en mi opinión, el \"Thai\" y el \"Buddha\". Los sándwiches no me acaban de convencer; algunos son demasiado secos. La hamburguesa de la casa, eso sí, está buenísima, y es una alternativa algo más ligera a la de ternera.   Tienen una buena variedad de zumos sanos y refrescantes y los postres están ricos, aunque un bol suele saciar el hambre. No obstante, si la sopa del día es la \"Dhal\" de lentejas, siempre le hago un hueco porque es mi favorita.   El servicio es muy agradable  y el espacio es amplio y alegre, además siempre está lleno de gente y abre hasta las once de la noche. También hay una tienda dentro en la cual se venden algunos de sus productos y se recogen los pedidos para llevar."}
{"text":"Great food if you're looking for mostly fast food vegan. They offer a variety of options, everyone is sure to be satisfied and not left hungry. Meat lovers approve!"}
{"text":"No visit to Montreal, historically, has been complete for me without a visit to Aux Vivres. While a bit of a challenge to find the first time I trekked up that way, it remains probably my favourite Montreal vegan restaurant. On my most recent visit in town for Pycon, I managed to get here twice. Looking forward to my favourites, the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich (where else can you get a good vegan version?), and the delicious brunch waffles.  ALAS! Neither remain on the menu. Instead, on visit one, I had their gyro, splitting an order of chili fries with my dining pals. The gyro was great, made cool and tasty by the tzaziki. The chili fries were a little so-so - about 10 wedges, on a bed of chili, topped with sour cream.  The second visit was a bit disappointing. I branched out into trying the Dragon Wrap, with a side of sauerkraut. The calling card of this dish, I assume, is the \"Dragon Sauce\", which is best described as \"orange\". It was maybe a bit like French salad dressing. I don't know. All in all not too impressive a sandwich, and I had some serious FOMO towards the BLT that a dining pal was eating, and the gyro that my ghost data from the day before was eating.  Topped it off with a coco-cashew cream pie, which was actually pretty excellent, and turned it into a pretty positive experience overall.  Still, do I yearn for you, O Montreal Smoked Vegan Meat Sandwich. Maybe I'll try making one at home. I really had my heart set on it."}
{"text":"On Sunday, after working up an appetite at the Lindy Hop workshops and just before leaving Montreal and heading back to Toronto, we had dinner at a vegan restaurant called Aux Vivres.... Read the rest of the review:  http://alltheveganthings.com/post/16444279031/vegan-dining-restaurants-review-montreal-aux-vivres#.Tx9u57ytM6w"}
{"text":"Trekked in the snow just try out this renown Montreal vegetarian restaurant, definitely worth it! Food was delicious and well priced. I had the kosmos plate which curved all my cravings, and first time trying tempeh was so yummy! Both me and my friend was amazed by the rich, smooth chocolate apple cake, and was even more so when finding out that the secret ingredient was zucchini. Definitely recommend everyone to try, vegan or not"}
{"text":"it was my first time at any vegan restaurant and it was a great experience. even though I am a meat lover , the bowl I took (dragon bowl) had great flavors and taste. It was pretty big and filling , I had trouble finishing it"}
{"text":"I have had the brunch, lunch and supper numerous times. Every time the food is scrumptious and so filling! The service is generally good, unless it is jam packed. The place fills up quickly for suppertime and if you are a group of 4 or more, be prepared to wait as they do not take reservations.  I am allergic to dairy and being able to have some non-dairy whipped cream on my waffles make me happy camper."}
{"text":"Generous portion, reasonable price and fresh ingredients. I had the buddha bowl (with tofu), which came in a large colorful bowl of veggies and rice.My only small complaint is that I wish he proportion of rice to veggies was more equal, as there was way too much rice and not enough veggies to balance it. However, the sauce was very good and complemented the meal well.    The price point was very reasonable. $11 for the sandwiches and $13-15 for the bowls. I wish i had the room to try their desserts as they looked so so good. Will definitely return to try the sandwiches and chocolate desserts !    P.S. Their menu is extremely extensive, so great place for non-vegan/vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"Love it here! Polenta brunch with beans and tofu scramble. The guacamole is awesome.  Vegan brunch goodness galore!"}
{"text":"Indifferent to neglectful service on a Friday night. The food was good once it finally came, but we considered eating our fingers in the interim."}
{"text":"Un des mes restaurants favoris à Montréal (et je suis même pas vegan)! Essayez le gâteau faux-mage! Superbe!"}
{"text":"Go there. If you are reading Yelp and wonder where to go, just go there. It means you either want to discover something new or want a safe choice. Either way, go there. This is the type of place that you simply have to know. Nope, I have nothing to recommend. Veggie food with awesome taste. I give it 5 stars for the price."}
{"text":"We both had burgers with fries, and were disappointed by the meal. The patty and bread were dry and thin, the bare garnish (one thin slice of tomato and lettuce) had been over-refrigerated (?), and the potato wedges were uninteresting and had a granule texture. Service was mediocre, food was lacklustre, and way over priced for what it was. Not worth it by any measure. People must come here to play into a certain image of themselves because this food is not good."}
{"text":"A must visit whenever I'm back in Montreal. I first tried it back in the day when Aux Vivres was still a dank closet with staff with dreadlocks down to their waist and a strong scent of patchouli in the air. They used to have a standard brunch for $11.  Then, the tides mysteriously changed and it renovated to the current look and menu. I think a lot of hipster Montrealers took this as a betrayal to the restos' hippie roots and always refuse to go here. I used to adopt the same stance until I tried the deluxe salad, creamsicle smoothie and coconut laced BLT (which tastes far less burnt than it used to).  It gets pricey but its good if you want something light. And as a former vegetarian, it's a just try for a menu that you don't have to worry about.  Slow service and can get packed in the evening. Decent patio."}
{"text":"I like Aux Vivres, but I think it needs to challenge itself a bit and improve it's food. Vegan food does not have to be just \"good for vegan food\".   Having lived in Portland, Oregon, I've had some amazing meals in vegan restaurants. I understand that the vegan culture in Portland is way more prevalent leading to more competition and therefore leading to restaurants having to challenge themselves and make the best tasting and more creative options on their menus. I think what Aux Vivres lacks is that healthy competition in the city.  I had the Aux Vivres burger for my main. The patty itself was good, although the consistency was a bit dry and crumbly. the potato wedges it came with lacked taste and were not prepared properly. they were not crispy at all. I only ate three.   The dessert I had was the Chipotle brownie and it was definitely delicious!   So, quick conclusion: great try, first of its kind in Montreal, obviously there is a large market for this kind of restaurant considering how there are consistently line-ups to get a table.   Perhaps a little bit of competition in the city would make them \"up\" their game a bit."}
{"text":"It's so good, we ate there twice on a three night trip and I wish we went three or more! The food is exceptionally delicious and fairly priced. I can't wait to go back for the uncheesecake alone!"}
{"text":"Up until recently, I had only ever had takeout from Aux Vivres. Which is fine for me and my lazy-arse homies, aside from the fact that when it did reach our plates, it wasn't all that warm (i.e. it was cold *heavy sigh*). As a result of these experiences, however delicious, I may have initially given this place 3 or 4 stars. Luckily for me and the Yelpers who are reading this, I managed to get my booty to the establishment last week, and what a gem this place is! Pretty cute place I have to say, with equally cute employers. I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to throw that in there, but really you should all be checking out this vegan hotspot for its, ahem, food. My friend and I split the Aux Vivres burger and Mekong wrap, which equalled glorious choices on our parts. In the past, I've had the Dragon and Thai bowls, and oh man....even when made 45-60 minutes earlier (thanks SLOW delivery service!), they were still brilliant dishes.   To end this lil review, I will most definitely return to delight in more vegan cuisine. After all, I love healthy food and this food will make you feel good. What will also make you feel good is oogling the nice looking staff that work there - unless you get caught. Then, you're just creepy like me."}
{"text":"Always busy...even on Monday nights! A sign that there is not enough vegan restaurant in Montreal...  Vegan fares that will make you come back for more...not all dishes are a hit in my opinion but some are highly addictive!   Try the pate samples with chapati or the dragon bowl. The vege lox is quite surprising, it does really taste like smoke salmon!   Delicious smoothies and fresh juices! Friendly service. That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but praise for my favourite little vegan hotspot on the Plateau - and Aux Vivres should not disappoint a grumbling (and earth-friendly) appetite. Their ingredients are super fresh, and I mean \"crunchy\" fresh. Salads are great. Also tried their pizza, which was served semi-warm but delicious nonetheless.. sometimes it's hard to believe they can substitute animal ingredients out and still be hearty - but they deliver. A+"}
{"text":"Aside from getting PICKPOCKETED and having $120 and an iPhone STOLEN, the food was terrific; just watch your belongings!"}
{"text":"Here I go, my first review on Yelp.  Let me start of by saying that I have never bought any of the items from Aux Vivres but I have gladly munched on many items that my girlfriend has gotten from there.  As a non vegan, I would not have paid the money for these items. But as of 11:35pm on a Tuesday night, I have officially changed my mind. Everything that I have eaten from this establishment has been superb! With the exception of the faux egg and bacon brunch plate. That one was a bit of a let down, rather bland if I may say so myself. But everything else has been so on point that I am thinking that perhaps I should try out vegan-ism. I would like to throw out a big shout out to whomever came up with these delicious recipes. Especially the guy that came up with the vegan BLT and the chipotle brownie. I cannot express how satisfied I am with those two items. If i could, I would like to shake hands with the creators.   Bravo Aux Vivres, never did I think I would be writing this review. Hopefully you guys can sprout amazing locations like this throughout North America. But until then my allegiance lies to Montreal for the best Vegan food!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm addicted to the Vege Pate. I had to run over to their take-out shop next door and buy some for home.  Aux Vivres was one of the best meals I had in Montreal. Everything is vegan and perfectly executed.  I had the dragon bowl because I wanted to try this dragon sauce that  I have heard so much about.  It was creamy, nutty, rich, and soooo good.  The bowl was so big I couldn't finish it!  Beets, carrot, red cabbage, daikon, lettuce, sprouts, and in-house made tempeh ($13.50).  As for fresh juices, the Popeye (5.95/7.50) was a magical spicy blend of cucumber, celery, apple, lemon, cayenne pepper.  I'm totally coming back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Also so good, healthky, full of colors, and so delicious! Always have tontake the dragon bowl (12$) worth alll the penny.  The restaurant is now twice space as it was. Veryconfortable, sunny seats and banquette. No wifi  Also the boutique allows us to bring back good food at jome. All vegan, all flavourful - so many things to try. The cakes can be brought home for a birthday or party. The smoothie has a perfect snack. But try to take away just one thing. Everything is so appealing"}
{"text":"Définitivement mon restau préféré  a Montreal ! Preuve que végétalisme ne rime pas avec monotonie ! C'est bon ,goûteux et sain ! Ma préférence va au bol Thaï mais J aime Le dahl de lentilles corail,  le bol dragon, les sandwichs. Adresse incontournable de Montreal !"}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas végé, mais si je pouvais manger aux vivres à tous les jours, je le deviendrais sans hésiter!! J'ai gouté à la salade Deluxe, dans laquelle il y avait du tofu grillé et végélox, c'était trop bon! J'ai aussi pris le wrap aux aubergines, IMMENSE et excellent! Évidemment nous avons partagé ces deux assiettes et c'etait parfait. J'y retournerai tres bientot!!"}
{"text":"We loved Aux Vivres! The Caesar salad, mixed dip platter, and the potato wedges with chipotle mayo were all so flavorful and fresh. We wish we lived in Montreal so we could go back regularly. THAT CASHEW CHEESE!"}
{"text":"Always packed. It's better to order takeout. for vegan food (which usually tastes like cardboard) it's excellent. I recommend the dragon bowl with Tempe."}
{"text":"Good vegan food!  I am happy there is an all vegan restaurant in Montreal. Au Vivre has a good size menu, the huevos rancheros for the weekend brunch menu are so good. Good coffee as well and great combinations for fresh juices, the popeye is green power and delicious.  They also offer cakes and desserts, I am excited to try some f those.  The restaurant itself has a diner feeling to it.  Nothing special.  The service is good and fast. Prices are reasonable.  Overall, a good vegan option!"}
{"text":"Aux vivres est LE resto santé par excellence.  Tout y est Végétalien! Il y a des salades, des burgers avec galette jardinière ( un style de pâté aux légumes) , des sandwichs en wrap, des smoothie décadent avec lait de coco ( MIAM ), des thés bios - tous cela et plus sans gluten, sans soya et sans noix . Le truc qui saute de l'ordinaire aux vivres ce sont leurs ''bols'' , un assortiment de légumes avec tofu grillés et riz bruns. Pour cette fois-ci,  j'essaie juste une entrée, le pain de maÏs servis avec Guacamole . La portion , que je trouve à première vue un peu petite , est toute fois un satisfaisante et à un goût succulent. C'est surtout le Guacamole qui me charme, il faut dire que j'ai un penchant fort pour l'avocat , donc en servis en purée avec un goût un peu citronné est une concoction parfaite à mes yeux. Le pain de maÏs est épais mais moelleux et a un goût délicieux avec ou sans la guacamole. Comme boisson, j'opte pour le Smoothie Lassi à la mangue qui est fait de mangue, lait de coco et lime avec une texture velouté et pas trop sucré - c'est idéal !  L'ambiance et la déco me rappel un resto des années 50 plus moderne, style 50's diner bar avec des petites banquettes aux sièges rouges et j'aime bien la terrasse qu'on retrouve tout au fond.   J'y retournerais pour essayer d'autres mets sur le menu notamment un burger portobello ( fanatique de champignons) et un des fameux bols.  Le sil hic est que je trouve le tout un peu dispendieux, j'ai payé 15$ ( pourboire inclus) juste pour une entrée et une boisson.  Certains diront que je suis trop lésineuse et Je sais très bien que les restos végé sont souvent plus dispendieux à cause des aliments bios qu'ils utilisent dans leurs plats mais sa serait appréciable de pouvoir déguster des mets santé à un prix un peu plus raisonnable et sa inciterait plus de gens à vouloir essayer!"}
{"text":"So a few years have passed and I think it's time for an update! Food, as usual, is delicious. Lots and lots of fresh veggies. Good flavours. Lots of choice. And service is excellent! Not sure if its the newfangled tablets the servers use to take orders, but everything went a lot more smoothly and quickly than in the past. And our waitress was so kind, checking in with us on a regular basis, and even chatting a bit about our days."}
{"text":"This is an EXCELLENT vegan restaurant. I'm a huge meat fan but I know it isn't good for me or the environment, but I can't help loving what I love (mmkay?)  I came here, ate the dragon bowl and LOVED IT. It was so delicious, satisfying and not at all \"vegan\" which you would think would not fill you up but it was so good.   I am definitely re-energized to become a vegan / vegetarian again. That dragon sauce is killer. Delicious. DELICIOUS. I want to eat everything on the menu now."}
{"text":"Great vegan food. They have gluten free options. I've been two or three times (it's a little pricey, but worth it). I've tasted the Dragon bowl (my favorite), tempeh burger (good), and the vegan BLT (good but you must like coconut).   I would recommend it and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious and affordable vegan cuisine, this is my number one pick in the city. They recently expanded, due to the constant flow of people, which has really helped minimize lineups. The food is fantastic and offers a mix of Indian, Greek, Thai, Mexican and other inspired flavours - but all with the Aux Vivres twist.   My usuals here are the curry lentil soup, the Thai & Dragon bowls with tempeh, the Thai choupati wrap and of course one of their fabulous desserts, notably the GF banana-chocolate torte or the apple-chocolate cake. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Nice, hip, yet friendly ambiance which is tough to pull off. Food is healthy and extremely tasty. We had a girl put together an awesome tasting menu for us with what in her opinion were the essentials which included: The Dragon Bowl (tempeh), Vivant Salad (tempeh), and my favorite this plate with an assortment of dips called the 'Mezzé Aux Vivres'. Was great. I went with Amanda, my girlfriend who wants to be included in this review. She thinks i was rude to the waitress but I wasnt."}
{"text":"Everything i've tried here is amazing. Their desserts, their food, the teas, the juices, all of it yummy. The prices are reasonable and the staff always friendly. One of the best vegetarian spots in Mtl"}
{"text":"Je ne peux m'y prononcer que pour les plats à emporter, mais je peux déjà donner mon avis et vous encourager à vous y rendre et déguster par vous-mêmes les plats qui y sont concoctés! Si vous avez des préjugés sur la bouffe végétariens, je vous encourage à faire face à vos propres opinions et à vous ouvrir l'esprit en faisant vous-mêmes l'expérience de ce restaurant! Vous verrez que la cuisine végan ne se résume pas qu'à de la salade verte et des pois germés!  Rien qu'en consultant leur menu, vous constaterez que le choix est large et les plats originaux."}
{"text":"Je vais aux Vivres quand mon frère et sa blonde viennent en Ville car je ne suis pas Vegan moi-même.  La bouffe est bien présentée, délicieuse, fraîche et invitante pour ceux qui ne s'y connaissent pas ou craignent de ne pas aimer les alternatives a la viande. Le comptoir pour emporter est invitant. Les smoothies et les desserts semblent alléchants.    Je trouve par contre que c'est relativement dispendieux pour ce que c'est... et il y a vraiment toujours beaucoup de monde, ce qui rend le service plus ou moins agréable."}
{"text":"Although I'm not the prototypical client of Aux Vivres, I can certainly appreciate good vegan food and this place offers it up in spades.   I usually have the Dragon Bowl with grilled tempeh or the Sirocco sandwich. Both I think are great options for someone not necessarily used to eating this kind of cuisine. Tasty, fresh and healthy, what more does a body need? Maybe a smoothie to wash it down. I personally love mangoes so I recommend the Lassi À La Mangue.  It also makes a great meal when you're working late as its not heavy at all and leaves you energized. Maybe all employers should start feeding us Aux Vivres?  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Some years back, I got the pleasure of visiting Aux Vivres. The ambience was wonderful and hip (do people use that word any more?). It wasn't too busy for a Saturday night, and it wasn't too cramped even for our big group. Although I was immersed in a French country, the English menu and atmosphere made me feel like I was back home again (The US).   Afree going over the menu extensively, I ordered the Thai Bowl with Grilled Tempeh. I am not sure (nor was I able to put my finger on it) but I wasn't \"wowed\" by it. I still enjoyed it especially once the dressing was smothered on every delicate green and orange veggie, but if I ever get another chance to visit again, I am gonna try something else. My other \"amis\" (aka friends) really enjoyed their cuisine, so I guess I was the only one that thought my dish was \"just okay\"  - The ambience and location gets a 5 - My dish gets a 4  I say it's still worth checking out, so if you are ever in town, head over there and bon apetite!"}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco and we are spoiled with vegan cuisine there so I was excited to try Montréal's 1st vegan restaurant! I brought an omnivore friend who lives here for Sunday brunch and we shared the Tempeh Satay, Hercules Salad w/Tofu & Huevos Rancheros. We each tried two juices. Then we had our own desserts (I'm gluten-free):  carrot cake for him and chocolate banana pie for me. The meal was wonderful. It was Frank's 1st time having tempeh so I was happy to find out your artisan tempeh was made locally.  I loved the tzatziki that came with the salad (I'm Greek!). So creamy!  The desserts were amazing!  So happy I tried you all out.  Highly recommended for casual dining."}
{"text":"Holy Crap. This place a wonderful. I am the type of person who tries to eat at as many different places as possible. When I travel, I try not to waste precious stomach space on the same place twice. BUT this place is SO AWESOME. I ate here 3 out of the 4 days I hung out in Montreal. Their food is AMAZING! I am one who is not easily fooled by so called 'healthy' desserts, however, their desserts while healthy are delicious as well! The only item I am critical of are their shakes and smoothies. Mmmmm... Dragon bowls. Don't miss out on their Veggie Lox"}
{"text":"This review may not reflect the quality of the food since this was my first vegan experience as a non vegan. Therefore It only helps compare vegan with non vegan food and from my taste view! I had the BLT and it was a recommendation of a vegan friend who had enjoyed it already. Did not like it!  They make coconut bacon which is neither. A semi sweet sandwich which is closer in essence to dessert than to main course. It also is pricy i say comparatively. Staff were nice and service was quite fast though."}
{"text":"Incontournable de la cuisine végétarienne à Montréal!! Très belle introduction à ce type de cuisine!  J'adore le bol du dragon avec du tempeh et leur pain au mais qui succulent avec leur gacamole !  Dernier favori le jus tonique vous donne un bon coup de fouet !!  J'ai même réussi à convertir mon mari a manger plus souvent végétarien grâce à leur plat!  Ambiance sans prétention mais très chaleureuse! Très bon service! À essayer!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Aux Vivres after hearing the hype for many years...and it does live up to its reputation. There were about 7 choices on the menu that could have been my #1 choice but I went with the chili fries with sour \"cream\" ... tasted like the real thing but no bad side effects from dairy afterward. A big win in my books. I hope they'll start stocking their sour cream in the store soon so I can bring some home and have it with pierogies.  Serving sizes were pretty large so if you have an appy or a juice, you might have to take home half your roti sandwich for lunch the next day.   The food came very quickly and our server was very pleasant.  Next visit: dragon bowl or buddha bowl, creamsicle smoothie, maybe the potato/chickpea curry roti or \"lox\" sandwich... Oh, man. There are going to have to be many next visits to fit all these in to my belly!"}
{"text":"Aux Vivres has some great portions spread out over a varied menu. My personal faves are the dragon bowl - a huge heaping pile of veggies and brown rice, the various sandwiches and the saturday-sunday brunch.  Some deserts are awesome (the brownies, the cookies), some - not so much (the pies - which can be a bit bland and served as small portions).   Everything on the menu is about $2 more than I feel good paying, but it's a clean place with some delicious stand-outs."}
{"text":"I don't eat here very often because my boyfriend is allergic to soy and nuts (I know, I know -- poor me :( ) BUT when I do come to Aux Vivres I milk it for what it's worth.   First, what I like about Aux Vivres is that the staff is always very welcoming and friendly, the establishment is always clean, and they have booths (a.k.a privacy). You always see a mixture of people from stay-at-home moms in Lululemons, hipsters, tourists, yogis, business people that work in the hood, etc. so it's wonderful for people watching while you're waiting for your meal (in the privacy of your booth, obviously...)   Recommended dishes (and drinks): Bombay Banane smoothie (I swear that I hear the voice of angels singing when this drink is brought to me), corn bread and the Dragon Bowl with tempeh (mmm..). The brunch is always solid -- le complet is delicious - to reduce the soy intake, I like to have palenta rather than scrambled tofu for an additional 2$ - and the pancakes are tasty and filling (order with appetite).  Also! According to my friends who love Aux Vivres as much as I do, the BLT sandwich and the carrot cake come STRONGLY recommended for all you fat vegans/vegetarians/omnivores out there.   My only complaint about Aux Vivres is that it's always busy and you may have to wait for seating ;) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were starving and in a hurry, so found this place quickly on urban spoon and glad we did. Great menu to choose from, we went with a Buddha bowl and a dragon sandwich, or was it the other way around?! Cornbread to start with and the dip was superb. Really light and fluffy bread. I had a chocolate shake, really thick and rich but not too much. We bought two corn breads and an apple crumble to take home! Yummy when toasted and reheated later.  My small dislikes were the incredibly squished in tables - we couldn't get up to use the washroom with asking our neighbours to move their tables."}
{"text":"At a convention in Montreal and needed real food. The choices were overwheleming and as an all Vegan rest I was giddy! Ended up going back the second nigth too. The Tempeh Burger was great and tasty, the portabella burger was amazing too.   Carrot juice brought life back into my soul. I am grateful for place like this when I travel. Helps me survive the madness. Staff was great and service was perfect. Love love loved it"}
{"text":"The food was incredibly good and there was SO much to choose from. The only complaint I have is that it's too far away from where I live. If I ever get back to Montreal, this place is definitely on my to-do list."}
{"text":"We took the BLT wrap and the tempeh skewers. Seriously can't eat them. The tempeh tasted so weird. Definitely not my cup of tea. The coconut bacon basically just tasted like sweet coconut with a bit of a reddish color. It was too sweet to be put in a wrap.   There wasn't much ambiance in the restaurant. It just felt like eating in a cafeteria. The staff isn't that friendly.   Overall, we didn't enjoy it and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Another place to fall in love with! The menu is varied and original,  place has a nice ambiance and staff is friendly!  Loved it !"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this small place in Montreal for their healthy and delicious vegan meal!"}
{"text":"Des crêpes, des crêpes! Oh oui j'en veux, surtout en brunch le dimanche!  Mais les crêpes vegan aux bleuets de Aux Vivres j'en voudrais tous les jours : leur moelleux n'avait rien à envier à des crêpes classiques. Oui oui, je vous l'assure. L'essayer c'est l'adopter. De plus cette portion généreuse est accompagnée de sirop à l'érable et d'une crème de noix, et des fruits : un délice!  Toute la carte semble appétissante, il y a des bols de crudités, des sandwichs, des burgers. Bref beaucoup de choix que je suis impatiente de pouvoir essayer lors de ma prochaine venue.  L'ambiance était plutôt familiale ce dimanche midi mais très agréable, un peu de musique. C'est très spacieux et le service roule bien donc peu d'attente malgré le monde, ce qui est parfait."}
{"text":"a treat to dine at Aux Vivres. critiques: service is slow (but they are often very busy), their portions are huge and prices are on the expensive side. other than that, yum yum!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, the server was very nice, food itself fresh but essentially a giant thai bowl of carrots and three wedges of tofu with undercooked rice. The desserts looked amazing. I feel like this sort of place has built such a rep that they focus on image expansion and commercialization as opposed to actual food, there are cheaper vegan restaurants with better food in the city."}
{"text":"Great vegan brunch  it was simply delicious!   I personally loved the Huevos rancheros, but my boyfriend's polenta was also very good. You can see everything is freshly made.  Good service. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Whilst in town for a music festival, we needed a quick healthy kick in the gut. Aux Vivres served up a satisfying brunch full of health. We started with a Juice and coffee. The Juice was so hearty I could've had it as a meal on its own. The coffee was good and strong but note they're not keen on giving free refills on your cup.   Most places had a wait for brunch but there is an enormous amount of seating here so we got in quickly and scored a corner booth.  I had a quinoa scramble meal. It was incredibly fresh and made me feel clean without feeling like I had to eat cardboard. Win!"}
{"text":"This is a review of Aux Vivres' takeout annex. The restaurant has always been great--dependably delicious food, generous portions, efficient service. The takeout spot, however, is overpriced. My partner ordered and paid $7 for a piece of pie that was laughably tiny when arrived. (Think of a playing card cut diagonally and you'll get the picture.) He said it tasted okay, but he would never go back there again. It's insulting."}
{"text":"Plesantly surprised! We tried a variety of things. I have the Latke Burger. It was okay, not the best, everything was falling out and slightly bland. My boyfriend had the Dragon sandwhich/wrap which was amazing and HUGE! We were worried it would be small and not filling but wow... He eats alot and half was already enough. All the sauces were amazing and tasty you wouldn't even know they're vegan. I loved the tempeh, especially since I hate tofu."}
{"text":"Still one of the best vegan joints in town; special brunch options on weekends, though they recently changed the brunch menu and added heuvos rancheros and replaced their awesome waffles with moderately okay pancakes.  If you're going for weekend brunch make sure to go early, massive lineups after 12:30 (parking is free before 1pm also)"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious!  My grumpy carnivore husband did not want to go with me.  He met me in front of the door of the place saying he had to brave himself to enter a world of veganism.   When we left, he admitted to having had an excellent meal!   Their cornbread was delicious, so was their tempeh appetizer.    Most of their dishes are naturally vegan, that is, they are not typical meat dishes where tofu replaces the meat.  They come from a variety of cuisines but mainly Indian and Mediterranean.     Everything is fresh and tasty.   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I feel this place deserves an update not because my opinion has changed, but because I was recently in Montreal for three days and ate here twice. That's the second time that happened. And that says something.  The staff is just amazing. They're patient, kind, give great suggestions, and, on the whole, really rule. My server told my indecisive self to go with the tempeh burger, served with excellent cole slaw, chipotle ketchup, and potato wedges ($9), and I'm happy I did. Fantastic. And it's absolutely massive, so prepare to enjoy the glory of a light-night snack!  It's a great place to take yourself on a solo date too. No wait if you sit at the counter (where, if you feel like it, you'll get to shoot the shit with wonderful strangers. Trust me.)."}
{"text":"Spent a year traveling weekly to montreal for work - aux vivres was my go to spot. I'd eat here at least 2 meals a week - i got to try most of their menu! Love everything ! Tons of flavour and variety - from heavy to light meals, lunch and dinner, there is something to suit your mood. Yummy desserts and great loose leaf tea selection too. Reminds me of 'Fresh' in Toronto - similar vibe, menu and style."}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food with great deserts and a liquor license. Prompt service regardless of how busy it is.  Delicious smoothies- particularly the chocolate one and the blue monkey.  Big portions- awesome for lunches. (French-Canadian translation)"}
{"text":"Je sais que la plupart des gens aiment beaucoup Aux Vivres, mais chaque fois que j'y vais, je me dis \" Meh! \". Ce n'est pas que ce n'est pas bon... C'est simplement ordinaire à mon avis.  Ils proposent une grande variété de plats végétariens, végétaliens et sans gluten que ce soit pour le brunch, le lunch ou le souper. Le personnel est poli et sympathique, et n'hésite pas à faire des recommandations. Les portions sont hyper généreuses et les plats très abordables."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan restaurant giving me a feeling where i can get re-energize not only with the bright decor but also with the colourful food they served.  The Mekong sandwich with the peanut sauce is so yummy and the portion are big.  And the desserts are not too sweet. I love it. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant vegan....qui saura également convenir aux non-vegans!  La carte est diversifiée et alléchante....et vraiment très intéressante pour les \"non pratiquants\" du veganisme! Tous les plats goûtes autour de notre table étaient goûteux et originaux....une vraie découverte!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal! Yes, I love poutine and crepes, but if you want some amazing veggie comfort food come here! Every time I'm in town this is a go to spot. The staff is very welcoming and always gives us a booth in the back(which is less crowded and more intimate than the front of the house). The chili is very good, the vegan soups hit the spot( if you make trips up to Montreal in the cold months esp., as my husband and I always seem to.)  The veggie burger is homemade (unlike the frozen stuff you get elsewhere).  I have not tried their brunch yet, but I will next time I'm in town. Also Blvd. Saint Laurent and Saint Denis are filled with nice shops, eateries, coffee houses, so you could spend a whole just food hopping and absorbing the culture.   If you're driving, you can find parking on the side streets off of Blvd. Saint-Laurent."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food. I have been here numerous times, and my favourite entree is the \"blt\", made with smoked coconut chunks. The potato wedges are a nice side dish, and come with some interesting dipping sauces. The atmosphere is very casual and the staff are friendly and helpful. The neighbourhood has a fun vibe, so you can go for a walk and explore the neighbourhood after dinner if you are new to Montreal or travelling."}
{"text":"Great vegan. Dragonbowl or thaibowl + vege pâté wrap for 2 are filling and tasty. Ginger cookie is a must.  Ambience is slightly lacking, but the good food and prices make up for it!  Aux Vivres is our go-to vege takeout spot."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Montreal. Maybe Anthony Bourdain considers skipping Joe Beef next time he's in town and trying this place instead to test his anti-vegan views --- dude, the food here is really good!   Some of best brunch and lunch food in Montreal. Just happens to be vegan.   If you still just want steak, at least come for the dessert. There is no reasonable emotional objection to at least trying a vegan dessert."}
{"text":"i appreciate the prompt service in aux vivres in montreal. i ordered the tempeh burger with a side of fries and purple cabbage which i extremely enjoyed. the lettuce in the burger was fresh and plentiful. the texture of the patty resembled meat to me. the moisture of the burger was delicious and again reminded me of meat. even though i am vegan, i found it still delicious to taste meat. i also enjoyed the ketchup sauce which was created by tomatoe sauce it seems like which i think is a good idea to make ketchup sauce"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and even though I'm not vegan, it doesn't matter, I love this place!  The service is amazing, everybody is beyond friendly and the food comes fresh and quick!"}
{"text":"I remember Aux Vivres when it was a small restaurant on Saint Dominique back in 2000. Sadly the quality has declined substantially since then. The dragon bowl and the vege lox sandwich were my former go to orders and the chapati with nut butter was one of my favorite snacks.    Yesterday we ordered take out and everything was disappointing. Tofu was not replaced with tempeh as requested, the brownies were prepackaged and fell flat with everyone, the rice bowls were missing rice, and the sandwiches were weak on fillings and heavy on carbs - I had to remove a large amount of chapati to taste the vegelox I was craving. The dragon sauce remains delicious but can easily be recreated at home or bought on site. The chapati is more authentic these days but it does not pair well with the nut butter.  I had a pretty big craving for aux vivres yesterday and am beyond disappointed. Can no longer recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was sooo yummy! I had the blueberry pancakes and my boyfriend had the huevos rancheros. The service was lovely and our waitress was super sweet and nice. The place was clean and so were the restrooms. This was our first time in Canada and I was so happy to find various vegan food places. I'm vegan and my boyfriend is vegetarian. I definitely want to come back here and try more of their food, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegan eats in the plateau. If your gluten intolerant, they got you covered as well. I recommend the vegan BLT, where the \"bacon\" is toasted coconut. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Great all vegan menu. Attentive staff and bright environment.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch!! WOW! Haven't had much of their lunch/dinner options but the Dragon Sauce is the best."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and original. I had vodkabiscus to drink, végépâté as a starter and blt cesar as main. Huge portions, and everything truly tasty."}
{"text":"The first vegan restaurant in Montreal with a store and food to go place next door. I had the Popeye green juice which is delicious and taste like a lemonade. The salads are huge! I couldn't finish it and was delighted to save the leftovers for another meal. They have an interesting desert menu. Not everything is gluten-free but there are indications on the menu. Their tempeh is handmade in Montreal."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food you can order at the express counter. Their dragon sauce is an all time favourite. We can't stop eating their sushi, sandwiches, dragon bowls. Healthy and nutritive."}
{"text":"The food at Aux Vivres will not disappoint vegetarians or meat eaters alike.  The place can get really crowded, but the line moves quickly. Reservations aren't a bad idea.   The offer a very diverse menu and portions are huge.  I love their salads and bowls The last time we went I had the chili which was excellent.  Service can be a little hectic, but pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Aux Vivres is by far my favourite vegan restaurant in Montreal.  I really want to try out more dishes, but the gyro pita and mexicali plate are so good that I never want to order anything else. Even my carnivore brother & boyfriend love the chilli.   I also love that they have a take-out store. Vegan tzaziki? YES PLEASE. Chocolate chip cookies? YES PLEASE. It's all soooooooooooo good.   Aux Vivres makes being vegan a breeze."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food! The server was friendly and informative. Maybe one of the best servers I've ever had. The food came lightning fast (it wasn't a particularly busy time of day, but still) and was delicious. I had the burger with fries. My friend had the wrap special of the day. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I stopped into Aux Vivres to-go cafe today for a late-afternoon lunch and it was great. I had the BLT and a chai latte. The BLT was HUGE - it could easily be split between two people for lunch- and the latte was perfectly spiced. This is a perfect drop-in spot for a quick bite. The staff were friendly, and the food was really tasty!"}
{"text":"Omg I want to try everything on this menu! I hope I get to go back before the end of my trip!  The wrap portions look humongous!  So many starters to choose from... I started with the Tom Yum soup, and the Tempeh Satay served with spicy peanut sauce. Wow yum yum yum!!!  Then I had the Chili with roasted potatoes as my main, soooo good! Of course I had plenty of leftovers to take home.  My friends had the Dragon Bowl and the Mexicali Plate and they were all equally satisfied. I was actually a little bit surprised about their UNcheesecake, I usually love vegan cheesecake but this one definitely wasn't one of my top faves.  This place is nothing fancy, just quality clean ingredients and good vegan comfort food. And reasonably priced, so it's perfect for an everyday lunch or simple dinner! Very happy :) ."}
{"text":"Was my first time at a vegan restaurant and I was pleasantly suprised. Food was really good. Had some tofu scrambled eggs as part of my breakfast and taste was great. Only downside is that you don't have free refills of the coffee, which some people  I went with were disappointed but since I don't drink coffee I did not mind."}
{"text":"There was a line to get in for dinner. We waited about 20 minutes. We got the BLT, which was just okay. We also had the Cosmos plate (souvlaki-style seitan, tzatziki, salad, potato wedges & brown rice). It was very tasty. Even the brown rice had flavor in it; could be from the souvlaki. We decided to try the signature dessert - the (un)cheesecake. It was so delicious, although a bit on the tarter side than expected, that we wanted more desert. We ordered the chocolate apple cake, that was really delicious as well. Would go back when in the area to try perhaps their bowls, which a few people had ordered and I am curious about it."}
{"text":"Aux Vivres is one of the few vegan/vegetarian restaurants in Montreal and is located on St. Laurent. It's a great option if you're looking for healthy, fresh and tasty cuisine. The restaurant itself reminds me of a dinner (so it's very casual), and the staff were very friendly. I think they have a terrace somewhere but.... I didn't see it so maybe that's just a rumor ;-)  I started with the Tonic (ginger, lemon, apple) - my immediate reaction was to purse my lips and widen my eyeballs because DAMN it was tart! But it was refreshingly delicious once I got over my sensory shock!  As a meal, I opted for Le Complet (tofu scramble, Tempeh bacon, cornbread, fresh fruit, salad and sweet potatoes). The tofu scramble was good - I liked the texture and flavor. The cornbread was delicious, as were the sweet potatoes. The salad came with this amazing Dill vinaigrette that was so good, I bought a bottle before leaving. The Tempeh bacon did nothing for me. I can't say I enjoyed the taste or texture at all.  Overall, the portion size was quite good (for me, anyway) and the price was appropriate ($11 for the plate).  I plan to go back and try one of their infamous bowls - I've heard they're amazing!  They have a small shop out front where you can be pre-made meals, or other items like their vinaigrette, baked goods etc."}
{"text":"Meh, try once kinda place.   I love vegetarian food and all but just wasn't feeling this place you know? We came right when they were open so maybe the kitchen wasn't ready yet so my sandwich took awhile to come out. I saw the BLT sandwich on Yelp and it looks so good.   They saw us struggling reading French so they finally gave us an English menu. They should just always leave out English menu!   |BLT sandwich| 11.25 CAD  About $8 US money for a sandwich is not bad considering it's vegetarian. So they replaced the bacon with coconut pieces that had a lot of flavor on its own but too dry for a sandwich. We bought a small box of it on the side for our road trip and it tastes better as a snack. What its lacking was the sauce. It was too dry with all 3 ingredients: coconut pieces, lettuce, tomatoes. I'm glad I shared and only had half of it. Could barely make it through."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy fare after a day of airport food. The smoothies were a little icy to start, but the Thai and Dragon bowls and the Caesar salad were all sumptuous."}
{"text":"J'ADORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everything on the menu is VEGAN friendly. That means I ate safely here without worrying about eggs or milk ingredients.   During a recent last-minute escapade to Montreal and after a night of fine red wines, sangrias and la terrasse, my friends and I woke up and came here for brunch.  My girls are awesome, totally not vegan, but was totally agreeable in coming here because I wanted to check this place out so badly before departing the city the same day. The place was packed around noon on a rainy Sunday morning and we waited about 15 minutes for a table. The waitress was rude, maybe she didn't like anglophones.. BUT we spoke FRENCH to her, so it's totally NOT us.  I ordered a brunch option called Le Complet, which came with a side salade with green dressing, stir-fry tofu, fake bacon, and corn bread. While my ladies found the stir-fry tofu amazing, I found it a tad bland, the corn bread was good, fake bacon was meh, BUT the side salad was amazing, it was fresh and crisp and the green dressing was divine. This meal also came with coffee or chai, so I chose the chai because it was vegan friendly and I could have my coffee black anytime!  We finished our meal with Gateau Faux-mage... fake cheesecake. It tasted exactly like a real cheesecake.. only less sweet and totally better for you because it's vegan and soy... and probably made with cane-sugar, not the refine white sugar crap.  I would MOST DEF come back here. If only I lived in Montreal. This city has blown me away, I did not know it was veggie-friendly!! :) *LOVE*  Montreal, je t'aime! *bisoux* A la prochaine!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés un midi pour luncher entre collègues. Nous avons tous aimé nos plats mais certains ont trouvé que ce n'était pas assez copieux. Effectivement, j'ai l'impression qu'il y a moins de patates dans les assiettes avec burgers, qu'il y a 4 ans... De mon côté, j'ai pris la soupe thai cette fois, et elle est vraiment délicieuse, accompagnée de 4 petits pain... Moi ça m'a suffit comme plat.. Je recommande Aux vivres à tout le monde, c'est une institution vegan à Montréal! :)"}
{"text":"Un classique! Toujours aussi frais et savoureux ce bol Dragon. Le personnel est toujours sympathique et le service est rapide. Le stationnement sur StLaurent est toujours accessible. Très peu à dire parce qu'à chaque fois c'est fameux."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go to a vegan/vegetarian place because I've been trying to lead a meat-free diet. However, I was rather disappointed with the food.   My friend had the Soup of the Day (pea soup). She liked it, but I thought it tasted a little under-seasoned, and the texture of the vegetables in the soup was grainy (over cooked?).  I ordered the BLT in a chapati wrap, at a friend's recommendation. The coconut chips were great taste and texture wise (although my friend thought the chips were too hard). My biggest problem was the ranch dressing -- over-powering and way too salty.   I had half of my friend's vegetarian chili, which was great! Good, hearty flavour. Could hardly believe that it didn't contain meat.   Friend's mango lassi was thick, but had too much ice. Not enough of that mango and yogurt tang flavor.   Service was AMAZING. Though the restaurant was busy, we got seated and served very very quickly. Really nice waiters!"}
{"text":"I just had best potato wedges I have ever tasted. Their brunch menu is delicious, but I honestly don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The mango lassi was delicious and very filling. Also the chocolate shake was probably the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Oh man...I am so disappointed to have to give Aux Vivres only 3 stars. I want to give it at least four, but here's the scoop:  The food is tremendous, really excellent. The portions on everything are huge. I ordered the famous coconut BLT (they use liquid smoke and nutritional yeast, then dehydrate the coconut meat) and, stupidly, got a side of roasted potatoes. Wrong! The sandwich on chapati (delicious bread BTW) was the length of my forearm. Potatoes were so much overkill, but still wonderful too. Rounded it off with a Santa Cruz pink lemonade. Yum. Wife got some sort of hummus wrap on chapati and dahl soup.  The service was okay, pretty indifferent, but Montreal waitstaff works at its own pace and stupid Americans who may be used to faster service should just come and chill for a spell. don't worry about the service.  So here's the issue: it was hot as balls inside the restaurant (no AC?), we opted to sit outside. As we finished the meal, we noticed that the bricked in patio (cute with all the veggies growing in raised boxes) must be next to the alley. There was a strong smell of the dumpster and garbage floating across the restaurant and it was so nauseating that I almost threw up! No joke. It was terrible. I literally had to leave the restaurant and go out onto the boulevard  to get some fresh air. It took quite a while to feel better.  People can't smell rot while they eat. It tricks the body into thinking you're eating poison. That is what the gag reflex is for. I cannot really fault Aux Vivres for this, but then again maybe I can. Poor planning on the part of the owners, or maybe they just didn't know.  I will be back to Aux Vivres for sure, because the food is fantastic, but I will be getting it TAKE OUT!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend found Aux Vivres as a place she wanted to check out on our long weekend trip to Montreal.  We arrived for brunch on a Sunday morning.  The location was a short walk from the nearest subway station.  We only had to wait a few minutes while two groups in front of us were seated.  The staff and atmosphere of the restaurant was welcoming.  We had both looked at the online menu and picked out a few items we wanted to try.  In the end we both went for the Huevos Rancheros; mine with sweet potatoes and coffee and hers subbed with regular potatoes and chai tea.  She also ordered the granola bowl.    We travel fairly often and usually hit up a couple vegan places; and the Huevos Rancheros at Aux Vivres is one of the best vegan brunches I've had to date.  The tofu scramble, beans, guacamole, pico de gallo and the sweet potatoes with the sauce on top were all perfect to taste.     All the flavors worked together for an awesome plate.  The coffee was okay a well, but nothing special.  I wasn't able to try the Granola Bowl due to an allergy, but the girlfriend enjoyed it and the fruit choice on top of varied and freh.  Overall our visit was an excellent experience.  If I am ever back in the city I'll make it a point to visit again and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! The asian inspired bowls are better than anything you can find in china town. Fresh veggies with amazing homemade sauces and great presentation make this a visual delight as well as mouthwatering, delicious, and healthy.  The food is filling and satisfying.  My daughter always orders the greek platter. Best tzatziki ever. Then there are the vegan desserts. Fantastic! This restaurant is all around amazing. Decor is cute, staff is attentive, and location is prime. If you're in Montreal Au Vivre is a must!"}
{"text":"Great vegan joint! The place is clean, service is fast and friendly. In terms of a vegan restaurant they might lack diversity or \"originality\" in cuisine but the food is great, portions are healthy and the price is worth it!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite vegan restaurants.  Nearly every dining experience I have had here has been great.  The price of a meal might make a bit of a dent in your wallet, but it's more than worth it.  In any case, for $12 I usually end up feeling full or nearly full.  The frustrating thing about Aux Vivres is that there are so many things to choose from, and so it is a constant inner struggle every time I visit on whether I should order something I've had before or try something new.  The last time I went I opted for the day's special - some pizza with a side salad.  It was fantastic.  I ordered a gyro to go as well and it was just as good.  During the summer months the creamsicle smoothie is one of the best fluids you could ever put down your throat.  In the colder months (or actually, any time now that I think of it), one of their delicious lattes hits the spot as well.  The staff are knowledgeable, generally friendly, and bilingual.  I have had some servers here in the past give me some attitude after they received my tip (which is always more than 15%), which I did not appreciate - but guess what?  They no longer work there.  The servers usually fill up the water regularly, which is very much appreciated.  It's as if they know I'm dehydrated every time I walk in there.  The atmosphere is semi-comfortable, but not always that inviting.  Sometimes I'm seated right next to other couples and they comment on the insane things I'm saying to my date/friend/self, which can be a little annoying when it's uninvited.  However, the setting is a great place to play the \"Guess Who's Not Vegan in the Vegan Restaurant\" game, if you're into that sort of thing.  I am glad I don't live next door to Aux Vivres because I would eat there every day.  I would bring my jars of pennies to the bank just to get extra cash to eat another tofu burger.  The staff would know me by name and frown as I would dump change on the counter, begging them to give me just one more slice of uncheesecake.  Yeah, so it's good.  Go try it out if you haven't.  You'll like it."}
{"text":"I went to this place on two occasions. Once with my vegetarian friend (who showed me the place) and once with my girlfriend. Both times were different experience and both were amazing. On my first visit with my friend, there was a pretty big line (I might be exaggerating, the line was maybe 10 minutes), so we decided to use the pick-up counter and eat in a nearby park. We both had sandwiches in chapattis and both we super good (I can say without a doubt that mine was, my friend said his was too). I was looking for something refreshing and fresh, and that was exactly what I got. On my second visit, we got a seat inside. The waiters were very kind and the service was fast. My girlfriend and I both ordered the dragon bowl (a nice bowl of veggies with rice) and a shake (I got bombay banana). The dragon bowl was so delicious and the shake was super flavorful. We had been walking around in the heat all day (and had some sugary stuff earlier) and we just wanted something fresh and healthy. The dragon bowls delivered! Plus it came to 40$ (before tip) for the both of us! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants something fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Wrap dragon, sauce dragon, chili, crêpes, smoothies. Pour vrai, j'adore ce resto. La déco laisse un peu à désirer dans la première (ancienne partie) mais à part ça rien à dire sur l'ensemble incluant le service impeccable."}
{"text":"I had heard so many great things about Aux Vivres (and I absolutely LOVE their tzatziki), so I was disappointed to walk in and find it to be more of a \"diner\" than an actual \"restaurant\".  It's definitely more of a casual place for a quick bite than somewhere I would go on a date night.  Sadly, there are not many other vegan options in Montreal yet, so despite our trepidation, we stayed to try the food.  Our waitress was very friendly and efficient.  She knew the menu well and was able to suggest a great organic beer for me and a smoothie for my husband that he practically finished in one gulp it was so good.  She also suggested a delicious curry soup that both my husband I and I loved - the Chana  Paratha appetizer did not go over as well.  After that, we opted for burgers, my husband choosing the seitan burger and I took the Aux Vivres burger.  Both were under-cooked and mushy and the roasted potato wedges they were served with seemed like they were yesterday's leftovers; coldish and soggy.  I bet they would have been delicious if they were served fresh & hot from the oven.  Tables were TINY and very cramped - we could barely fit our food and drinks on our little table for two, so I had to keep using the empty table beside me.  I would have liked to try some of the delicious-looking desserts, but we were feeling claustrophobic in our tiny cramped booth, so we   skipped dessert.  Probably won't be back :-("}
{"text":"As a guy who is vegan I appreciate the number of options to have here.  It is a massive menu unlike most places where there a binary option of 1 or 0 .  That being said I did not much care for the main dishes of food and I wanted so much to fall in love with it :( The dragon bowl I did not like the sauce, and it wasn't too good dry.  The chili was pretty good, although that's not something unique to vegan restaurant.  The blt was okay but I didn't really like the taste too much.  I tried another appetizer of dipping bread into a nice sauce , that was good.   The carrot cake was excellent and I would like to try more deserts.   The service was great, very friendly both times, nice vibe in the restaurant .   It didn't seem healthy food to me, the dragon bowl certainly was, although the rest seemed to be a one way trip to gut city.  Maybe I just need to order different dishes to get a better experience , but I'm not gonna try again until next time in montreal."}
{"text":"Tester lors de la fête d'une amie, nous avons pris à emporter.  Malgré la file d'attente et la salle du restaurant plein à craquer, nous avons été servis rapidement.  J'ai goûté deux de leurs jus .... juste hallucinant (sinon j'en aurais pas pris deux ^^ ), le popeye et le tonique (mon préféré).  Pour le repas j'ai pris le burger Aux Vivres, vraiment bon, pour un burgers VG, il était vraiment bien garnis et ça goûte tellement plus que burger normal.  J'ai aussi pu goûter le BLT ( Bacon Laitue Tomate) d'un ami, oui oui bacon, mais du bacon VG, fait à base de chair de noix de coco, et bien sincèrement c'est excellent, malgré mon scepticisme au début. On retrouve la même texture et le coté fumé aussi, sauf qu'il y a un goût de coco."}
{"text":"Interesting diner type feel , ugly decor and very dim,, also in front of the front door they have nasty plastic curtain ,,, first thing we got was the water received in a large mason jar,, tasted like water from a Chinese food restaurant, not cold at all,, I got the Thai tofu side with a lug head beer,, beer was interesting, tasted very carbonated,, and had a really bitter taste of hopps,, got my food,, rim of the dish was dirty,, Tofu tasted like it was frozen ,, taste very bland (cardboardish) and it was very tough,, peanut sauce that came with it was quite good actually along with the roasted peanuts ,, it seems the only thing this place knows how to cook is the veggies ,, the Bok choy was really good along with the pickled cabbage and carrots ,, lettuce tasted old and I got something that resembled turnips which tasted like nothing,, I didn't dare taste the rice ,, my friend got the dish and her brown rice looked overcooked I tasted it and it was utterly disgusting ,, it was mushy and so bland,, basil on top of my dish was also old ,, this was my first time to a vegan place and vegan restaurants pride themselves on fresh food , this was a disgrace."}
{"text":"Well for a non vegan...let me tell up you that this place is excellent! I was brought in there by a friend to try it out and what a surprise!! I loved every piece of my meal: I got the brown rice bowl Dragon and I have to say it was delicious. We also got te chocolate banane pie at the end which we swallowed in 2 bites ;) overall excellent service and food, don't hesitate to go!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent vegan place that I frequent when I am in the plateau/mile end area. The portions sizes are decent and the prices are pretty cheap. When the food is good, it's really good, when it's bad, it's downright awful.   Good : The Sirocco wrap, if you get in the take out section is only $5.49. The Dragon sauce is probably the best to compliment that wrap. The 'cheese' scone and 'un-cheese' cakes are probably my personal favorites and I would go out of my way to get those. The Mezze Mediterranean w/ Chapati will not disappoint either!    Bad : Avoid brunch if possible, the blueberry crepes are really dry. The chili fries were a bit cold...and dry. Not impressed with their portobello burger either. There's not much flavour in the tofu, I think it's grilled without seasoning.   Bottom Line : I have my favorites, but this is not the place to be adventurous because most stuff are pretty bland without the sauces or just really dry. However, it's still my go to place for cheap vegan foods."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Monday, very busy restaurant. There were four of us, each tried a different dish and all were pleased. Waitress was attentive but reserved. Lacked spark or personality. Otherwise, a good meal for all."}
{"text":"Alright let me start off by saying that Montreal's vegetarian scene is mad strong. And I'm only realizing this now that I'm away from all of my faves :(  Anyway,  Aux Vivres always gives me these \"I can't believe this meal has no meat\" moments. The food is top-notch, super flavorful, and gets me to eat food I normally wouldn't (who knew tempeh is sooooo good??)  My go-to meal used to be the polenta brunch, but then I stumbled upon the famous dragon bowl and never looked back. Honestly, if you don't know what to get, just go for this guy. It's full of flavor (the sauce is key) and also filling!   I've gotten takeout from Aux Vivres, been to the restaurant, gone there for brunch, gone there for supper, had one of their premade bowls... I feel like I've experienced every aspect, and it's always been a good experience!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and unusually large-portioned for a \"Save the Earth\" place.  Despite everything I'm a fan.  This is probably because they are really friendly as people though others may disagree.  The \"everything\" I refer to is...  EXPENSIVE, slow service, sometimes long lines, hippie tree huggers everywhere, dirty  washrooms, no daily specials, crappy desserts (because they are vegan!), uncomfortable seating, renovations that took months instead of weeks, and completely untrained service."}
{"text":"Get the dragon bowl! I got a burger when I came here (which is not bad), but when I took a little sample of my friend's dragon bowl...oh the regret! Definitely coming back here to devour the whole thing myself.   The decor here is simple and clean. The waitress who served us was very helpful in giving us recommendations and we had a nice little chat about that secret sauce in that dragon bowl too. I heard their smoothies are pretty awesome, so there's another thing to add to my \"to try\" list."}
{"text":"I stopped by this wonderful small vegan spot to try out one of their awesome smoothies. Aux Vivres has two sections...the resto where you can have a sit down meal and the takeout section. The smoothies come in 6 flavors and are truly delicious! I tried the mango smoothie which was pefect for a warm summer day. The ingredients are fresh and the smoothies themselves are refreshing and so tasty! Will defintaely be back!"}
{"text":"A must for vegans visiting Montreal. We went on a Saturday night, and we got in just before the big dinner rush. There was a wait for tables the entire time we were there. Lots of variety on the menu, and very reasonably priced. I'll be going back on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm a meat lover, which is the reason I can't give this restaurant 5 stars. Having said that, this place is sublime...they're food is absolutely delicious!  A friend and I arrived a bit before 1pm on good Friday and the place was full, but they gave us a table within a few minutes. As the meat lover I am, I had a hard time navigating the menu so I asked the waitress for help and she helped me very diligently. My friend got the Dragon Bowl with tempeh and I got the Buddha Bowl with tempeh...I didn't even know what tempeh was! Food arrived and we devoured it, and I can stress how surprised vegan food can be so good! For dessert we even shared an \"uncheesecake\" (in French the pun was better, at \"gateau au faux-mage\") and however they make it, it tasted exactly like cheesecake. In the end, my friend and I each spent about $20.  If you're a carnivore and you're looking for a small break from meat, or your date likes vegetarian/vegetalian food, this place will be appropriate!"}
{"text":"Being condemn to live in suburbia, I have not been to an establishment with such cool vibe. I had the Mexicali Plate. Well presented with colours and textures, it's a pretty incentive to eat healthy. Dare I say it, meat may be overrated."}
{"text":"Coconut! Bacon!  Is there anything else left to say?  Ok, maybe a little. Housemade flatbread, fresh vegetables, huge portions, a cheesecake that I honestly didn't love...but...coconut bacon! I love vegan BLTs with tempeh, but coconut bacon is just so much more exciting."}
{"text":"Okay, so, my first meal in Montreal, this is a famous vegetarian/vegan place in town.  The wait was not very long, about 20 minutes, but hey, must be good!  The food was actually good but not amazing.  The sandwiches are a bit blend, needs seasoning, even for vegan you need seasoning.  They did gave us some dipping sauce for the sandwiches, but how does that work with sandwiches which aren't even in a torpedo shape?  I got an shake to go with my meal.  I was starving and had to get some sort of protein.  Overall, the experience was a bit rushed and crowded but the food justified the wait.    Here's my horrible experience with the hostess.  She should not be a hostess at this restaurant.  I'm a Canadian myself, but lives and works in the US.  At the counter, I handed my american $20 bills to the hostess to pay for the meal.  Her first reaction was \"This bill is fake!\"  I said what?  What do you mean by fake?  She claim the graphic design on the american $20 bill is fake.  I assume she was joking with me so I laughingly told her the bill is an older version of the new bill.  Its still valid, just was printed in the 1970s not the year 2000.  She then yelled at me called me a liar and ran off into the kitchen (the restaurant is crowded and loud).  Leaving me, my friends, and the poor waitress staring at each other blindly.  The waitress said \"sorry.\" and smiles and sneaks away.  I then pulled out my other $20 USD with the UPDATED graphics.  The hostess came back and I handed her the $20 USD bills.  She stared at them and examines them with her high tech possibly racist eyes.  She stared at me and angrily shelved me the change.   By this point I'm ragingly angry.  I was determined to get her fired, but my boyfriend talked me out of acting as silly as the hostess.  I walked to the waitress and gave her a $10 CND for tip, since she was so nice to us.  Then we left.    About 6 blocks later, I realized the hostess gave me back the wrong change, she had given me $10 CND short of change.  At that moment I had to decide whether I should make the rest of my trip about getting her fired or enjoying Montreal with my fellow french canadian friends.  I chose the third option, yelp."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I enjoyed my meal here. I had waffles for brunch. Wasn't crazy about the soy \"bacon\" but the rest was really good.  Haven't been back in a while but would recommend even if you aren't vegan."}
{"text":"Bland, Overpriced. Plus bad service.   We stumbled upon this cool-looking place, hungry and tired after a bike ride. Nice décor and signage, great playlist, but surprisingly lacklustre food.  One of us had the assiette mumbai - under-spiced, overcooked, and disappointing at 14 bucks. I ordered  the soup de jour, which arrived only after I asked about 5 times.  It too was devoid of any flavour, really. If you want really good, tasty vegetarian food in Montreal,  just go to any of the numerous falafel joints you run into.  This place is seriously, inexplicably overrated."}
{"text":"THEIR BLT IS THE BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN. My friend who lived in Montreal for a while told me that its his favourite BLT (and he's not even vegan.) So i had to check this place out. SO worth it. Amazingly large blt wrap filled with fantastic coconut bacon and a really amazing flavourful sauce. So fresh and huge!  I want to visit Montreal just to go back there"}
{"text":"First visit to a little vegan place and we loved it. The staff is bilingual and incredibly helpful and polite.  However what most reviews fail to mention is that Aux  Vivres is also a small vegan food shop as well! It was pleasantly surprising, mostly because we could freely shop around while waiting for our fresh food. The smoothie was fantastic- raw and pure fruit juice, and the portion size for the burger and fries we had were perfect! The burger was absolutely delicious, moist, and the right amount of spicy. We would definitely go again :)"}
{"text":"The sandwich are okay, the portions are really big though. The tempeh was really good, especially the sauce coming with it. Planning on going back to taste other stuffs on their menu  I was really impressed by the gateau fauxmage A MUST seriously.   The staffs are really friendly"}
{"text":"Alright. I found it. The best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal (and believe me, I've spent a lot of time and money searching).  We had the sampler plate of spreads, served with warm chapati. We were blown away by the beauty and creativity of it. Tofu cream? How cute! Olive tapenade - mindblowingly delicious. We promised ourselves we'd eat lightly - but everything disappeared! Who stole the chapati? We couldn't have eaten all that?! Ok, ok, fine. We just had to.  My dragon bowl is what I wish every meal could be. Warm, filling, delicious, and exciting. Hello, delicious, incredibly unique and inimitable sauce! Where did you come from? Can I marry you? Why is my friend kissing her BLT? Does she want to marry it too?  There's also great music playing and a great, brightly-lit atmosphere. Waiters are all warm and attentive. The desserts make symphonies resound in your head for hours.  Next time I'm bringing my sleeping bag and never leaving."}
{"text":"Great food here! There were so many good looking options, which did make making a decision hard. We got the Bombay smoothie which had masala in it, yum! We also got the spread platter served with chapati, probably my favorite. We ended the meal with the Thai peanut bowl, which was also very fresh, yet hearty. Servings are large so you get quite full even though ingredients are plant based.  We went on a Monday during the lunch hour and they were so busy the servers were literally almost running around. The service was slower than what you would expect, but it was fine given we're on vacation."}
{"text":"The food here is substantial and delicious. This tied with au pied de cochon for favorite restaurant in Montreal.  Mekong was delicious, satay sauce and normal fillings.  The lox spread is out of this world. Amazing. Exactly like real lox. Magic from dulse and carrot pulp.  The multi-spread appetizer is a great intro to the food here.  BLT is also amazing. The coconut is smoked/salted just right to swap for bacon. Maybe too much lettuce and not enough mayo for me, but very good.  Souvlaki is good. Burgers are amazing and meaty."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. My vegetarian boyfriend said it was his favorite meal in Montreal! He got the Aux Vivres burger, and I had the Chana Chapati sandwich -- both were great. I also tried the Bombay Banane smoothie to begin and we shared tempeh satay. Excellent! We had a reservation. Service was excellent - one small irritant was that after we were seated, it took about 20 minutes for a server to come over. Other parties came in and were seated and served before anyone came over. But overall, excellent food at this busy restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nous avions pris à livrer. Cela semblait réellement appétissant, et un peu hors de nos habitudes (c'est bon la viande !). Puis tant de monde nous en avait dit tant de bien !  Mais vraiment, quelle déception. Au final, c'est une salade composée sans rien de bien particulier sauf la sauce et le tempeh. Pour la première, une dragon, et il reste un gout bien étrange dans la bouche, qui masque le gout des autres aliments. Pour le second, une découverte : ça ressemble à du poulet, mais c'est pas du poulet. Et c'est juste pas bon.  Bref, on ne fera pas l'effort d'y aller."}
{"text":"Super cute vegan diner with ample amount of choice! I had the Thai bowl, but it was a little underwhelming compared to some of the rice bowls I've had at places in Toronto, like Fresh. The flavours were a little bland and nothing really stood out. However, it did taste okay and it was a good, sizeable portion. My friend got the sirocco chipati and it was massive! It's definitely an item you can share amongst two if you aren't extremely hungry. Overall the service was great, the staff really knew the menu items like the back of their hand. I only wish the food was slightly more flavourful!"}
{"text":"We dined at this restaurant and tried about 4 dishes, all of them were fine but its more a lunch place then for dinner.    I wouldnt come here expecting a gourmet dinner, but i would come again for a simple lunch!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurants végétarien à Montréal.  Vous ne vous tromper pas en allant mangeant à Aux Vivres. Le plus plate à manger là-bas est qu'il faut faire un choix sur un seul plate.  Je recommande le bol dragon pour une bonne assiette.   Si vous êtes plus du genre sandwichs, le BLT goûte vraiment le bacon et vaut le coup d'oeil. Même chose pour le sandwich avec des pois chiches et de l'hummus. Mon meilleur moment est quand j'y vais à deux personnes et qu'on échange nos moitiés de sandwich.  Vraiment un bon choix de restaurant, que vous soyez végétarien, végétalien ou carnivore comme moi."}
{"text":"Really like their home made wrap with choice of curry sauce or eggplant. Though the other stuff I'm sick off pretty quickly. Tastes good everytime but it's not a place I go often."}
{"text":"Vegan vittles have never tasted so good as they do at this bright cheery cafe. I went here on my birthday after reading Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The waitress told us that the recipe for the sauce on the Dragon Bowl was a secret and it wasn't hard to figure out why--it was amazing! It tasted like the love child of tahini, sesame oil and several other things I'd love to identify. With a pile of veggies and rice, it was a party in my mouth! We also tried a Thai peanut salad with tempeh, which was also delicious, and their \"Tonique\"--a blend of apple, lemon and ginger juices. This was probably the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Why can't making healthy choices always taste this good? I plan to try and replicate the dragon sauce and Tonique at home, but it's hard to imagine my own efforts would stand up to the amazing Aux Vivres. The rest of their menu looked as enticing as what we had. I'd probably be in danger of going here 2-3 times per week if I lived in Montreal. Happy birthday to me!"}
{"text":"I finally visited Aux Vivres after hearing so much about this place. I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  I ordered the latke burger dressed with vegan tzatziki, tomato, pickle and lettuce on a whole wheat burger bun, served with potato wedges. There was a long hair on my plate under the burger so that wasn't a great start. I threw it away as a reflex before I could say anything to the waiter so that's on me. But how did they not catch that? The patty itself was made of sweet potatoes and beets so that was pretty yummy. I also liked their vegan tzatziki but their potatoes were bland and the pieces were way too large.  My sister ordered the BLT that comes with coconut chips instead of bacon. The wrap was so huge she had to take half home and it doesn't even come with a side! She would have preferred if the wrap was half the size but with interesting sides like a soup & salad.   I hated that they sat us near the window as it was way too hot there from the sun. The people who got to sit away from the windows were better off. The banquette side is pretty uncomfortable so I just wanted to leave the whole time. The service was great though. Fast, friendly, polite. The food legit came out within 5 mins!  We shared a large berry smoothie, which was delicious and refreshing. We also tried the banana chocolate pie; it was rich and decadent. Yum. I just wish that instead of a coconut crust, it was a graham cracker one. They should describe it or make it more clear on the menu.  So overall, I feel like the menu relies too heavily on soy substitutes (tofu & tempeh) to replace animal products, unlike at Green Panther, Crudessence, Lola Rosa, etc. I'll probably give their new Westmount location a try when it opens since it's so close to me but I think if I'm craving healthy, I'll just go to Mandy's or Green Panther. Great option for vegans though!"}
{"text":"I NEED TO STEAL THIS RESTAURANT & TRANSPLANT IT INTO TORONTO/GTA.   Montreal's first vegan restaurant and definitely one of the BEST I've ever tried. They have a huge menu where EVERYTHING is vegan and I don't have worries on 'hm, would this have egg/dairy in it?' ..needless to say, it's so blessed. We ate here pretty much daily on our montreal trip and we were so so so happy with it.   Service is top notch and they're super friendly AND bilingual. Bless. Food came out very quickly too. The menu is HUUUGE and I wanted to eat everything, to be honest. I was sad that I didn't get to try the blueberry pancakes for brunch. I did try the BLT made with coconut bacon and the portions made my inner fat kid extremely happy.. it was pretty much good enough for two people. I'm used to the vegan restaurants in the greater toronto area charging people $30 for a lettuce leaf so when the food came, you can tell I was a happy child.. I couldn't even finish more than half of the thai bowl. In addition to that, heir food is very high quality & definitely fresh.  The star of the show is definitely their desserts - if you're vegan, you definitely feel me on this one: it's SOOOO difficult to find vegan desserts just anywhere. I definitely took advantage. Did I order vegan cheesecake (gateau faux-mage .. so cute) for brunch dessert? You bet the hell I did! It was definitely just like real cheesecake and unbelievably creamy. Um yes, please. Can someone please make this for me back home?!?!? I crave it, just thinking about it and I don't even like sweets, so wtf?   Definitely one of my top must-visits whenever I come back to mtl."}
{"text":"Everyone is right. The Dragon Bowl is divine. Sitting solo at the bar, I was served quickly by a friendly waitress, and had the perfect perch to watch the smoothies getting buzzed. Do I want a creamsicle? With coconut milk, orange juice, carrot juice and vanilla. Yes I do!  It's a busy bustle, full of healthy looking people sporting yoga mats, talking about tennis and scarfing down the best tasting veggies I've had in a long long time. And yes, we all were taking pictures of our big bowls.   I'm already craving my next meal here, and I'm still munching on the leftover beets, carrots, grilled tempah, organic brown rice, daikon, rice, cabbage as I write!"}
{"text":"Ah! Aux Vivres! Un classique des restaurants végétaliens de Montréal! Un de mes préférés, mais vous allez comprendre pourquoi je donne 4 étoiles et non pas 5. À ma première visite j'ai commandé le complet: Exquis tofu brouillé, parfaites patates douces, savoureux bacon de tempeh, une belle salade avec une délicieuse sauce à l'aneth et le meilleur pain de maïs que j'ai mangé de ma vie. Je suis littéralement tombée en amour, et mes autres visites ont confirmé que Aux Vivres était mon restaurant végé \"to go\".   Je vous dirais que les classiques sont sans hésiter le BLT (wrap (énorme) composé de bacon de coconut, laitue, tomate et beurre végé), le Burger Aux Vivres (Galette jardinière vraiment exquise, oignons caramélisé, mayo chipotle) et le fameux Bol Dragon (Plein de légumes, tofu grillé à la perfection du riz brun bio et une sauce qui vous fera hésiter à chaque fois que l'envie vous prendra d'essayer un autre plat que le Bol Dragon: ELLE EST TELLEMENT BONNE!).   J'ai essayé le Burger portobello, qui n'était pas si fantastique que ça; le champignon était imbibé d'eau et franchement ça goutait pas grand chose. Les patates qui viennent avec les burgers sont aussi pas si fantastique (on perd des points ici, je suis une vraie fanatique de patates!), elle sont un peu trop grosses, ce qui fait qu'on perd le goût des assaissonements qui les entourent et qui ne sont pas assez abondants.   Le bol Bouddha est à tomber par terre: La sauce Wafu est excellente! Les smoothies sont tous bons, j'ai pas peur d'en commander un au hasard je sais que je vais être satisfaite. Le tonique Pomme-citron-gingembre est un coup de coeur! Ça goute beaucoup le gingembre, mais l'acidité du jus de citron et le sucre de la pomme vient bien balancer le tout!  Une de mes amies a déjà pris les frites au chili; même remarqué pour les patates exprimée plus haut, le chili était bon mais il faudrait retravailler les frites! L'assiette Mumbai est très savoureuse aussi.  Pour ce qui est des brunchs, mon préféré reste le complet: La Polenta est bonne, mais je ne suis pas fan de la genre de \"bisque\" de fève noires. Et pour les gauffres elles sont exquises! Et énormes! Un must! Mais personnellement je suis plus du type salé pour le déjeuner :) Finalement les desserts. Je n'en ai gouté que 3: Le gateau choco-pomme ne goutait pas les pommes, le brownie était un peu sec, mais la tarte choco-banane, WOW! Mais j'abandonne pas, il me tarde d'essayer le Brownie au Chipotle et leur fameux gâteau aux carottes!  Alors Overall: Un must, les prix sont juste et puisqu'ils font la livraison, ça me fait des bons repas équilibrés quand j'ai pas envie de cuisiner! Malgré les quelques points négatif (qui, dans le fond, sont juste une question de goût) je dirais que c'est mon restaurant préféré, je n'en suis jamais ressortie déçue et il remplit beaucoup plus de mes critères d'appréciations que la plupart des autres resto, végé ou non. L'ambiance est toujours agréable, le staff est charmant et la nourriture arrive rapidement. Parfait pour un souper en famille ou entre amis; il ne manque que la bière et j'aurais donné 5 étoiles! Osez, la viande vous manquera pas je peux vous l'assurer!"}
{"text":"Solid vegan restaurant. Coming from Toronto it was nothing mind-boggling, but it was respectable. If you've never been to a vegan restaurant before you'll enjoy yourself.  The gyro and the aux vivres burger were both good. A friend ordered the thai bowl and said it was disappointing.  After all the rave reviews for the desserts on yelp I was fairly disapointed. Boyfriend and I shared the chocolate apple pie and the chocolate banana pie and they were both pretty meh."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and I'm sure any vegan you take here will be happy and impressed with the options. However, the sandwiches are mostly lettuce and cost more than $11 - so that is never my order. I usually go for the dragon bowl or the veggie burger or the \"soul food\" mumbai plate - all of which I think are delicious.  I've taken out of town visitors here who have been impressed with the menu - and they've enjoyed their meal! There is a nice terrace out the back for the summer months.  I did have one ridiculous experience where I ordered the Chana Paratha, described in the menu as: spiced Indian flatbread topped with chana, sour cream, cilantro [now it seems to have changed to mint] & tamarind chutney. When it arrived with 2 cilantro leaves, I asked for a little more and they said they'd have to charge me .75cents. Sure, whatever. A plate arrived with one sprig of cilantro and another 2 leaves. At the same meal, they also charged us for extra dressing. The whole thing struck me as a little classless and a bit ridiculous; and having been a regular, kinda pissed me off. One star docked.  The food is good and creative but if you've been going here for a few years, then you may remember when the staff were friendlier, the portions more generous and the prices lower... Second star docked."}
{"text":"I went here on my recent weekend trip to Montreal after read recs on yelp. We went pretty out of our way to go here for lunch and we enjoyed it but were not blown away. We shared the cold plate with a delicious veg pate, hummus, veggie puree, and a veg lox which I was less excited about. We also split a seitan sandwich was good and a choc coconut smoothie. Would love to have a place like this near me, but again did not fee like a place worth walking 25 blocks out of our way."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for their huge, fresh selection of vegan options. I've eaten here for the past 2 days and couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"+1 = loved the Buddha bowl +1 = excellent apple pie +1 = friendly service! +1 = healthy! +1 = fair prices  Will definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal"}
{"text":"great food and smoothies!! Had the blue monkey smoothie which was insanely good, I actually didn't even want to order it but the person I was with wanted it so I agreed, and it was just really the best. The BLT is crazy good too, coconut \"bacon\" is insane, I just don't know how they do it! And the chapati is great. The only thing is that the portions are huge so probably splitting one sandwich would be enough for two people, and a smoothie of course."}
{"text":"So when I travel I always look up the best food in the area. This place was on the top of the list for vegan food and I hopped in an uber and came straight here.  The concept of the food is what got me. They're food is an Indian Mediterranean fusion, and you could taste it in the food. The spot is very homey, and the servers were really prompt. Also price wise- very affordable!  I got the coconut bacon BLT because that's what I read was good, but it personally wasn't my favorite dish at the table. It was too little bacon and too much lettuce for my preference.   But wow at the rest of the food- the tempeh in peanut sauce, the La Companion brunch plate, and everything else. Just wow.   Please go here if you want large portions of really great food!! Ive never eaten a tempeh dish made this well!"}
{"text":"I do not care if you are vegan, vegetarian, carnivore or omnivore, but you have to try this restaurant out!  I came here on a Saturday night with a friend and here's how it went:  Pros: - Extremely friendly staff, smiles on everyone's faces - No wait or minimal wait to get seated - Fast service (Saturday night from appy to dessert took us only 45 minutes) - Delicious smoothies! I had a Bombay Banana smoothie and miss awesome had a zesty lime-celeri smoothie (forgot name). They were made on spot and were refreshing! - Generous portions: had us rolling after we were done - Food? YUM. We had the large Chili and a Mekong sandwich and we couldn't finish them all. But we saved space for a choco-banana cake!   Cons: - Price-wise is alright but not too shabby! - Mekong's peanut butter sauce was a bit on the sweet side, but not that bad!  Extras: I am actually omnivore but I really enjoyed it! I will definitely return.   Thank you Aux Vivres for being vegan-friendly."}
{"text":"This is just one of those place that vegans and vegetarians alike enjoy going to. And they have done a good job of it.   Everything we ordered I enjoyed. Particularly I liked the Bombay smoothy and the channa with paratha.   One thing I noticed is that there were three either recent-made-moms or about-to-be-moms there. I don't know if it means anything, but it is something I observed while I was there. I guess it is a family friendly place.  This place is worth a visit. You will not be disappointed. There is tons of variety. You might only be disappointed that you can't eat it all at once. :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We could hardly believe everything was vegan. We're pretty sure the food is made out of angel livers and unicorn poop.  Particularly mind-blowing: The carrot soup and the brownie with nuts.  Guys, please open a restaurant in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"This place is a decent vegan restaurant but today i found a 1\" piece of plastic in my salad and it reminded me of the time they had to close for 2 months because one of their employees lost his arm in the bread maker."}
{"text":"The amount of vegan options at this restaurant was amazing! Absolutely everything!! It's a relief to be able to go into a restaurant not have to pick and choose and ask 1 million questions. I was only in Montreal for the weekend and I went to days in a row! Love this place I highly recommend"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  We tried 3 different sandwiches.  Sandwich Sirocco, Sandwich Dragon, & Sandwich Chana.   Each one was delicious,  We also had theTempeh Satay which we really liked.  It was Saturday afternoon and bitter cold but the place was quite busy with a lot of young people enjoying a really nice ambiance. Our server was very friendly and efficient.  Parking is in the street but we had no trouble finding a spot.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I expected to hate it... Now I'll probably go back. I must admit the thought of eating in a vegan restaurant was about as interesting as the thought of sawing my own leg off!   In a restaurant world of fatty food, this place fills my need for some healthy grub.   The warp was huuuuuuuge. The salad was gorgeous. And the service was very pleasant. No complaints!  GO!"}
{"text":"My sister is OBSESSED with this place. I'm actually not a big veggies fan, so this place was really awesome for me because it made vegan interesting. She ordered takeout one night during a visit to Montreal. I particularly enjoyed the frites. But she raves about the bowls."}
{"text":"As a vegan who has lived in some extremely vegan-friendly cities , Montreal's most famous vegan restaurant is nice but nothing spectacular.  The positivies are that even though it is always busy, the service is very quick and friendly. The menu is huge with something for everyone, and it is very reasonably priced.  The food itself is good but can lack flavour . The salads and bowls are large and fresh, but often rely on the (pretty good) sauces for flavour. I also have had a burger which was pretty stodgy and dry, as were the wedges that accompanied it .  The best part of my meals there are the smoothies, the creamsicle is particularly good!"}
{"text":"This place has almost a cult following for its coconut bacon alone, but the rest of the food selections are equally rich in character, and delicious.   I've been here a couple of times and always leave stuffed and completely satisfied. It's decently affordable, too. The juices will give you *super powers* (just kidding, but it feels like that when you drink it), the servings are really substantial and there's excellent selection, whether you're vegan or not.   I've gotten chana paratha, which is an entree but was plenty enough eats for me, along with a juice (although I wasn't starving when I got there). I've also gotten the Assiette Mumbai, which was simple fare, and also really tasty and satisfying - seems I have a thing for chickpeas. Next time I go, I'm trying their famed Dragon Bowl.   Honestly, you can't go wrong here. The staff is sparkling, there's a ton of seating and you're being good to your body with every bite."}
{"text":"Being able to get a healthy dinner at 10 in the evening - priceless.   I go to this place whenever I am in Montreal for business and I always come for a late dinner. (Never been there before 9pm)  The staff is friendly, the food is great. I always try the soup of the day and know all the items on the menu by now. Also, the quantities of food are large, I simply love it."}
{"text":"I love vegan eats and Aux Vivres is a Montreal staple. I had the Aux Vivres burger and my boyfriend had the tempeh which he didn't like. The Aux Vivres burger was pretty mediocre however the ambiance and service was nice.  I probably wouldn't go back as it isn't particularly affordable on a student budget nor am I vegan. I prefer Lola Rosa!"}
{"text":"Oh man. This place. The French Canadians really know how to make a Jewish vegan New Yorker's dream come true. Vegan lox! Do I need to say more?! My childhood...and that butter! I've tried to smoke carrots myself, but to no great end result. If I lived in Montreal, I would likely be here every day. Everything was delicious! The living salad was insanely delicious. I actually couldnt stop eating, I ate everything....Top top top vegan find ever and I have traveled everywhere in the states. Merci, MERCI!"}
{"text":"My group of friends decided to try this place out since one of the members is a vegetarian and said that the menu looked amazing. It certainly smelled like it upon walking in, and it was surprisingly less crowded than I expected it to be, so getting a table of four was relatively easy. The menu itself was so large and diverse, so don't worry about not having any solid options because there's something for everyone.  Three of us decided to get smoothies to start, and we ordered the Tropicalia, the Blue Monkey, and the Mango Lassi (I'm not exactly sure why it's under smoothies but okay I guess???). Each of them were delectable and definitely required some sort of self-control to not drink them all at once. In addition, I got a malai kofta appetizer, and it tasted wonderfully homey and divine with the combination of chickpeas, various spices, and the sauce that they were cooked in. My friend also got the Tom Yum  soup, which I found to be flavorful, but she said that she felt they OD'd on the ginger a bit.  For our main meals, I got the Aux Vivres Burger while my friend got the Mexicali plate and the other two got the Bombay Thali. The burger was really tasty and clearly was made with fresh ingredients, but I felt that it kind of fell apart quite easily so that I was left with a quarter of the patty and one bun by the end. Also, the coleslaw wasn't the best that I've had, but they do serve up some mean roasted potato wedges that I still dream about. All of my friends seemed to like their individual plates, although my friends who had the thali didn't eat the salad on them because they don't consider it \"real food\" hahaha.  I skipped dessert this time, but two of my friends ordered the chocolate cake and apple pie. The chocolate cake was served in a really thick slice and was really good, but the apple pie was served in a really flat and thin slice? Both were priced the same as well.  Aux Vivres is one of the better vegan dining places I've been to in Montréal, although it can get slightly expensive. While it's by no means a completely cravings-free substitution of meat, it does a decent job of creating spinoffs of classic world dishes that are delicious in their own right."}
{"text":"I'm a health-conscious and open-minded omnivore with a vegetarian partner, so I've tried a lot of different vegetarian and vegan versions of things and been able to compare them with \"the real thing\". Sometimes they closely imitate the real thing. Sometimes they don't compare, but are still tasty. And sometimes they're a failure on the scale of Aux Vivre's veggie butter, which I think they must have really worked on to make sure it resembled actual butter in no way whatsoever. If you've ever wondered what corn bread would taste like with Asian salad dressing, Aux Vivres is for you!  Aux Vivres makes to-go food that can be found in local groceries and markets. I recently picked up the BBQ Tempeh wrap, because I'd never had BBQ tempeh I didn't love, at least until that day. Would recommend this wrap for anyone who finds tofu just too flavourful. If I had to rate this tempeh's flavour on a scale of 1-5 where 5 is a plain hard-boiled egg and 1 is the tap water at my mom's house, I might give it a 0.75.  Aux Vivres makes what my partner calls \"California hippy vegan\" food, the hallmarks of which are a fetishization of certain \"superfoods\", the vege bait-and-switch (it's just like regular butter, in the sense that both are yellow!), and a focus on the foods' health benefits at the expense of rich, full-bodied flavour. Definitely come here if you are looking for an interesting salad to Instagram, not so much if you're after comfort food.  The redeeming quality that gave this review the extra star is Aux Vivre's Dragon Bowl, specifically Dragon Sauce, of which you can get a bottle to take home. Whatever Dragon Sauce is, it is delicious, and tastes vastly more like butter than whatever's in their veggie butter."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for our takeout lunch. I ordered the Mumbai Thali. It was a small yet filling dish. I think I missed my salad amidst the hubbub, but scored some delicious reddish bread. Perhaps it was Paratha with slightly spicy flavors. Overall, a good meal."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and then dinner on another occasion.  For breakfast I got Le Complet and it was incredible.  The best vegan food I have ever had.  My friend got the blueberry pancakes and they were lacking honestly.  The waitress had something up her butt b/c she was pretty darn rude.  For dinner the next day I got the lasagna, which was bland but the salad was awesome.  Had the banana chocolate pie for dessert, which considering it was vegan was quite good.  Really impressed by the coconut crust. Service that night was great and made up for the other experience."}
{"text":"Superbe découverte de ce restaurant vegan. Mon 1er restaurant de ce genre.  Les plats sont relativement copieux et raisonnable en terme de prix.  J'ai pris le sandwich sirocco à base d'aubergine grillée, houmous, poivrons rouges rôti, laitue et tapenade d'olives le tout enveloppé d'une feuille de chapati. J'ai vraiment aimé ce mélange.  Ce que j'ai adoré c'est le smoothie blue monkey à base de bleuets, banane, jus d'orange et agave, miam une tuerie ! Et n'oublions pas la tarte choco-banane vraiment excellente.   Le service est très rapide nous avons attendu une 15aine de minutes avant d'être servi, c'est génial.   Penser à réserver car il y a beaucoup de monde et ce restaurant est fameux pour tous les vegan et les autres !"}
{"text":"Ambiance décontractée et service rapide ! Plat copieux et coloré! Les enfants ont adorés !  La qualité de la nourriture ainsi que la diversité seront plaire pour tous. Les néophytes dans la bouffe végé seront également conquis et surpris!!!"}
{"text":"Since I'm GLUTEN and DAIRY free, this is seriously the only place where I can confidently dine at in Montreal while knowing I won't feel a little off the next day. I frequent AV around once a month but now that it's getting nice out I'll make the walk here probably once a week. It's the closest I can be to eating at home if not healthier. They take cross contamination and food allergies seriously and their food is just plain healthy, which makes for a healthy Yelper.  My favorite dishes here are the small house and the BLT Caesar. Their lentil soup has been hit or miss but I'm not sure if it's the soup or me (sometimes I am pickier than other times if you know what I mean)  I love their thick cut roasted potato wedges, smoothies, and gluten free desserts too!  Gluten free and Dairy free Montreal peeps PLEASE PM ME with any similar restaurants that have no cross contamination like these guys do. I'm at a loss but this seems to be it for me thus far. Help me out y'all."}
{"text":"Had blueberry pancakes. We're a little light, but very good overall. My GF had huevos rancheros. Those were excellent.   Also had mango lassi. Very good. So was fresh OJ.  Server disappeared for a while. So took 20 mins or so to get our check."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants hands down. Even if you're not big into vegan food, you will enjoy this place. The Thai bowl is very delicious with a great combination of raw ingredients like the carrot and lettuce and the warm like the rice. The peanut sauce tops it off quite nicelty. The service is great, ask for Melissa."}
{"text":"We tried the SANDWICH SERVED IN CHAPATI, it wasn't good at all, it was so salty I couldn't finish it, they put way too much sauce in it.  The price is WAY WAY too expensive for a non-meat meal, it's basically a pita wrap with lettuce, nuts, tofu, spices and a yucky sauce, $11 for that? Really? We had two of those with 2 ginger ale, it was almost $40.. WOW..   The service was awful too, we were served by a girl that didn't give a f**k. I guess we interrupted her afternoon nap, since the place was mostly empty on a Saturday.  When I left I felt ripped off, I can't believe that so many people recommended this place.. Montreal has some really low standards."}
{"text":"Very delicious, fresh, vegan, awesome food.  The service was very friendly, attentive, and really fast.  Not only is the food great, but there is also a variety of cool teas to go along with it.  Decent portions and again very fresh. Relatively inexpensive.  There's an awesome seating area ouside in the back.  Also, I discovered you can catch very fast WIFI in there, so if you're looking for sweet sweet internet you'll find it here as well.  CLOSED MONDAY."}
{"text":"Get everything.  Seriously, the food is outstanding.  The smoothies and juices are ridiculously good.  The soups and sandwiches are just amazing, too.  I forgot it was vegan."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. I think they have a good selection on their vegetarian menu. They give a hefty portion so be prepared to get  a doggie bag or bring your appetite. Their wait-staff are bilingual which is great & so is their menu. Check it out,because it is delicious."}
{"text":"Save room for dessert on this review.  * * *  This is a vegan restaurant with lumberjack portions.  One meal here and you will not have to eat again all  day.  Individual dishes range between four and five stars.  I had an absolutely first rate vegan chili - with soy cream and lots of garnishes and a lot of high quality tortilla chips.  The bowl was the size of half a bowling ball.  The chili substantially exceeded Texas chili standards - and I should know being a Texan.  Vegan chili has no meat and meat is the essence of a successful chili.  Most vegan chili has to work hard to qualify for \"that's nice dear\".  This was the real Texas stuff and was a downright pleasure to eat  Even if no cow was actually hurt in the making of this production.  * * *  My wife's Thai bowl was just okay.  This was another half-bowling-ball bowl filled with grains, tempeh, and vegetables cut too large to conveniently get in your mouth and eat.  Flavor? Meh.  * * *  A first course of gazpacho was better than Health Food Store Gazpacho and worse than Barcelona Gazpacho.   Nearly every health food store makes a gazpacho in the summer, and they may as well call it  \"Cold and Insipid Tomato Soup - But Eat It - Its Good For You\".  This was better than that.    It had good tomatoes.   It had personality.   It had its own non-standard taste.   (I suspect a serrano pepper was lurking in the background).  It had cilantro which I personally can't stand.  But the vegan at the table who came with me to insure fair judgment of cilantro dishes   Told me that - even giving the cilantro a break - the soup wasn't that great.  Give it a B.  * * *  Now for the accomplishment of this kitchen.  Dessert.  One of the dishes is a chocolate apple cake.  This is a purely vegan cake with zucchini as a binder and flaxseed taking the place of egg.  There are a lot of vegan restaurants that try dishes of this ilk.  The result tends to be a sodden heavy mess.  In contrast, this was an intriguing fascinating dessert.  The apple taste was very subtle but it was there, giving the cake lightness and personality.  The cake was delightfully moist.  It had fascinating flavor.  Is it as good as a cake from the finest patisserie in Paris?   No.  But it leaves Moosewood and Rainbow Collective and Casa de Luz cakes far back in the pack.  I admire the technical skill of the baker of working out the exact proportions of these recondite ingredients to make the cake a textural and flavor success.  * * *  So if you need to eat your healthy vegetables, this is a great place to do it.  Zucchini in your main course.  Zucchini in your dessert."}
{"text":"Shame on me for not coming here sooner. The truth is though, I thought this place was a militant vegan place that would smell the seafood-eating fear in me if I dared to walk through the place. (I'm serious) It turned out to be this sunny looking place with abundant seating.  Unlike others I was with, who favoured the revered dragon bowl, I wanted to venture out and got me a Macro Bowl. It was delish but I admit, I like seaweed (wakame) in its natural state and then they had me at the miso-tahini sauce, which is a super combo in my opinion.  We ordered a banana chocolate pie to split, and as a crust-head (yes I've coined a new term for those who enjoy crust) it was yummy, pie was a bit too sweet but the smooth and creaminess was very WOW, and I am glad that we split it four ways, otherwise, I would have been groaning the way home.   One of the best parts of the meal I think is how awesome the server was, I don't know her name, but she was not only attentive to our water needs, but she was friendly and non-pushy.  She also was honest about her favourites when asked, and seemed very genuine. We also had a baby at the table, and she provided the baby chair thingy no questions asked, (can you tell I wasn't the mother? hahaha \"thingy\").  Overall I had a lovely time here, and will definitely come back for MOAR!  Rumour also has it that they have a beautiful terrace, but I didn't venture there."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food right in the middle of the plateau. Although I'm not a fan of the lighting (very fluorescent and uncomfortable), the food is really good. My favorite is the chili on potatoes, served with a cashew cream cheese. So delicious! Their brunch blueberry pancakes are also very good, though I wish they had a bigger brunch section!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Vegan places to eat in Montreal! The absolute best is the Dragon Bowl - it will become an addiction!"}
{"text":"Very refreshing and tasty food, I always go to this place whenever I can. My favorite things to order is the BLT,the dragon bowl and the carrot cake."}
{"text":"Wow! Very happy to have found this place. It seems like in Montreal all the vegetarian/vegan places are insanely expensive for what's actually put on the plate. This place, on the other hand, satisfies every bit of hunger I have for under $13.   That aside, it's actually really really tasty and they have plenty of options. It's worth trying and ill definitely be taking some friends there!"}
{"text":"Pour calmer la folie végan de Laura on est venu tester un repas dans ce restaurant qui jouis d'une bonne réputation. Nous avons pris le brunch qui vient servis avec un chai latté ou du café. Le chai était assez intense au niveau épice. C'était dans la partie supérieur pour ma part, plus ça coupe trop le gout de la boisson ! Au niveau du plat mes huevos rancheros étaient bien bons, une bonne portion qui m'a permis de tenir jusqu'au soir. J'ai adoré les patates douces avec la petite sauce qui va bien. le guacamole était bon. On a aussi pris un smoothie au fruit qui était bon et aussi un peu épicé ce qui rehaussé le gout des fruits. Satisfait de notre repas, le service est correct. A tester pour d'autres plats dont notamment le gâteau au fromage qui semble assez bon :)"}
{"text":"We ate brunch on a Saturday morning at Aux Vivres during a short trip to Montreal. We sat in the back garden, which was really nice. Loved seeing basil and tomatoes growing in their boxes instead of fancy flowers. My bf and I shared the waffles and the polenta cakes brunch options - and both were very very good. We loved the cashew cream and fruit topping that came with the waffles. Normally I hate polenta anything, but their's was delicious, as was the guac that came with it. My only minor complaint would be that the black beans not be pureed, but served whole, but the dish was still good. The mango lassi we had was excellent - not too sweet, and with yummy pieces of real fruit in it! We also tried the coconut \"bacon\" on the side, out of curiosity - it was interesting and nice - it would have been great as part of a trail mix. My bf (who is not vegan) said the waffles were one of the best brunches he'd had anywhere. The prices ($10-$11 per brunch plate, which included coffee!) and service was also fantastic. If we get to Montreal again, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"For years we have gone to Montreal only to strike out finding any decent vegetarian options.  Finally, someone told us to check out Aux Vivres and it was so worth it.  Clean, classy & a great variety of veg & vegan fare.  This is a must check out & worth going to the mile end for the shops that are also around it!"}
{"text":"Came here end of August with my surprisingly open-minded father (furthest thing from vegan)! I loved it. I got the Thai bowl with tofu which was served with a delicious peanut sauce and brown rice. My dad tried the Tempeh satay sticks with peanut sauce and the cornbread with veggie butter and guacamole. He loved the cornbread, not so much the tempeh (but I think as a meat eater he might have been put off)! Overall I loved it! And I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Le restaurant est toujours plein et la nourriture est toujours bonne. Parfait restaurant pour un soir de semaine."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great atmosphere. Additional pre-made items in the refrigerator make this a great stop for lunch and snacks to get you to your next destination hanger (hungry anger) free. Had the seitan gyro and a can of Yerba mate tea. it was filling and delicious. No regrets."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch on a Sunday around 11:30am- surprisingly no major line up!  We ate: - Mexicali plate (3/5): the guac was awesome, but the chilli was cold and lacking the wow factor. A+ tortilla! - Portobelo mushroom burger (3/5): While the mushroom itself was delish, the toppings and potatoes left more to be desired. - Fresh apple juice : (4/5) umm 6$?  Overall it was okay,  but I could find these dishes at other non-speciality Restos and it would be probably better.   Ps. Upon leaving at 1ish there was a crazy line!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, sensational service, and superb company made this a place to remember.  The staff is friendly, efficient, and generous with the coffee, and even the most finicky eater will find a favourite here.   I had a Bombay banane smoothie to start, with sweet dates and spicy ginseng blended with cream soy coconut milk.  Indulgent yet light, and the perfect accompaniment to a generous portion of chick pea curry that I inhaled whilst awaiting my friends.  The curry was savoury and nourishing, and could easily satisfy a lunch time craving by itself.    I had a Bouddha bowl for my entrée, and it was more than I could eat even if I'd begun on an empty stomach, so yay for leftovers!  The vegetables were perfectly steamed and crisp, with an excellent Japanese sauce that blended well with the fresh veggies and brown rice as well.    My friends shared a stunning cornbread starter with vegan butter, and fresh green salad, and BLT that quite honestly made me wish I'd heeded their advice. Arriving on a fresh chapati, the layers of juicy tomatoes, verdant lettuce, vegan mayonnaise, and coconut bacon, had me transfixed on what I could only imagine to be the best tasting vegan sandwich ever.  My friends seemed to know, yet didn't offer even a single bite.  Well played."}
{"text":"Mais assez décue dans l'ensemble... Je m'attendais à beaucoup premièrement parce que j'achète leurs produits quand je fais mon épicerie et je les trouve très bons, deuxièmement parce que j'en avais entendu du bien. Peut être que j'en attendais trop, mais ca n'a pas vraiment fonctionné avec moi. En revanche, ca ne m'empêchera pas de continuer à acheter leurs produits.  J'ai choisi les pancakes et honnêtement je les ai trouvé ratés. Bien trop secs et fades à mon goût. De plus, l'accompagnement est minimaliste, je trouve que pour le prix ca mériterait un peu plus de choses.   Le service est correct, ni plus ni moins.  Je n'ai pas vécu ca comment une expérience extraordinaire et il y a peu de chance pour que j'y retourne un jour, pour y manger sur place en tout cas.  Si je mets 3 étoiles, c'est grâce à leurs produits que j'achète en épicerie uniquement"}
{"text":"It's odd that I haven't reviewed Aux Vivres yet. Maybe in an alternate universe I did, but anyway, just to make sure I'd like to note that the bright clean design, the light wood benches, the relaxed funny staff, the leafy back terrasse and convenient takeout counter are all soul soothing. Most welcome though is the hit of fresh, healthy, and tasty always to be found here.   The dragon bowl and vegan bacon are my usual picks, but my personal highlight is the creamsicle smoothie. Coconut juice and all manner of healthy things winningly combined to taste exactly like those orangey ice creamsicles you remember from sunny kid days at Grandmas (If you don't have this memory you can borrow mine and then go to Aux Vivres to re-live it. I hope you enjoy!)"}
{"text":"I've been to Aux Vivres more times than I can count. One of fave restaurants!  The first time I went I was less than impressed. My bill was $40 and it included an appetizer, main, dessert and drink; I disliked everything! I ordered the kosmos plate which came with a salad that had literally no dressing - that, and the blandness of it all, is what everyone assumes to be vegan cuisine.  I couldn't get over all the positive reviews so went again, and ordered different things - can't get enough of it   - Sandwiches are awesome... the gyro pita is amazing. Have never had such great tzatziki!  - Best chilli - so flavourful. Love the vegan sour cream and guacamole on top - LOVE their brunches. Wow. So filling and so much for the $ - be warned there are line ups on the weekend for brunch  - Take out counter is awesome. You can buy their cakes at reasonable prices (carrot cake - amazing)  - Service is prompt and friendly   Of course there's areas for improvement: renovations are really due - booths, chairs, etc very very out of date.   If you went and didn't like it, try it again, try something different - awesome"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and I have nothing but love for this little place.   I think I may have actually dreamed about their roasted cornbread. It's hearty and slightly spicy served with a vegan butter sauce. I recommend this in combination with the GIANT veggie chili served with guacamole. It keeps very well overnight.   Their macro bowl is also particularly good. It is a cleverly conceived combination of fresh organic veggies over steamed brown rice. To my taste, I think this dish could be improved (ever so slightly) with some enoki mushrooms, but I'm not sure how those fly with the macro lifestyle.    As for the ambiance, I very much enjoy their summer patio. They've done very nicely with it."}
{"text":"I love love love the food here! If I lived in Montreal this would be my go-to place for everything. After partying it up super hard - this is the place you wanna go where your body is just going to vaccuum up all the nutrients it lost the night before. Electrolyte love! My body is like a dry shriveled up sponge when I come here and I just suck everything up till I'm wet... wait a sec... this food porn thing is going a little far.  I am back home in Vancouver, WISHING we had a place like this, where you can get yummy veggie food and have decent service, and not pay an arm and a leg to get it. I am already looking forward to my next trip to Montreal in September so I can gorge all I want and not leave feeling like I do right now after this festive seasonal break people call Christmas. All I got for Christmas this year was fat, but that's just more of me to love less!"}
{"text":"I just feel good eating here. It's a bit pricey for me, but I can tell everything I've ordered is made with quality ingredients (and it's good for me!) Being a bacon lover, I was a little skeptical of the BLT since the bacon is replaced by smoked coconut but once I tried it, I never looked back. I went with a group of both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and everyone left happy. Favourite dish: BLT Favourite juice: the Popeye"}
{"text":"This vegan joint is truly a treat.   The food is decidedly delicious, and the service is truly outstanding."}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm not even vegan. I'm no where near vegan but I leave here completely satisfied. The service, the food and the price are fantastic. My 9 yr old daughter loves it too. I may become vegan if all the V food tastes this good.... Well probably not but I can contemplate it now without getting the shivers. So eat here and enjoy feeling almost vegan. I have a false sense of vegan smugness that is completely temporary but good."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal for a long weekend. After trying brunch on the first day we came back every day after! The chai was delicious and the pancakes were the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Slouvlaki tempeh sandwich was not my jam. Carrot cake had a bit of a strange flavour. Not my favourite vegan carrot cake. The banana chocolate cake was delicious."}
{"text":"When traveling, it's always hard to find great healthy food that's easy to grab and go.   In Montreal - Aux Vivres is not only a great place for good food, but a must try if you even remotely like vegetables. Their Dragon Bowl was amazing. Great mix of veggies with brown rice.   The food was so good I picked up a bunch on my way bag for my veggie roommate. She's now in love with their veggie burgers, so it looks like I'll have to head back to Montreal shortly to bring more great vegan food back home."}
{"text":"Auz vivres ! Un bon classique, toujours agréable lorsqu'on a envie d'un bon repas végétarien et savoureux !"}
{"text":"Bombay banana smoothie was very interesting, pretty good, but my sister absolutely loves it. It contains banana and chocolate but is strongly spicy, tasting of masala and ginger. Malai kofta balls were good, also spicy.   Now...the real thing... Dragon sandwich with grilled tempeh is DA REAL BOMB!! 5 stars on the very first bite. Huge portions, fresh ingredients, and warm bread wrap. Normally not a big fan of tempeh, but it was absolutely fantastic here.  Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything is very innovative and fresh.  There's a huge variety on the menu, with creative combinations and uses of vegetarian ingredients, and the selection goes beyond anything I've seen at vegetarian places in the Southern California area.  The place is casual, so service is minimal but very pleasant.  Vegetables are crunchy, sauces aren't too heavy.  Portions are very generous, and prices are reasonable despite that it's vegan/vegetarian.  I'd recommend the BLT type of wrap, which has lots of flavors and textures going on. Soup was also really tasty and satisfying on a cold November day.  I'd definitely recommend it for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike."}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que je me délectais du bol dragon, en vente dans différentes boutiques à Montréal, comme au marché Maisonneuve par exemple, il me tardait de découvrir plus de recettes au restaurant. C'est un dimanche matin que nous décidâmes d'y venir prendre le brunch et ce fut un réel succès! Sur 4 convives, chacun prit un plat différent et tous étaient délicieux, les jus, café et thé également.  Et pour ceux qui sont accro au tempeh, la boutique d'à côté vous propose pas mal de produits vegan, bio etc... Une façon originale de cuisiner chez vous comme \"Aux Vivres\". Arrivez tôt, l'ouverture est à 10h le dimanche, car la salle se remplit très très vite, au point que lorsque nous sommes parti, la file d'attente allait jusqu'au dehors. Une adresse que je recommande à tous, vegan ou non, vous serez conquis!"}
{"text":"Un incontournable pour tous les végétariens: du burrito matin, au BLT, au jus d'orange fraîchement pressé, même mes amis carnivores y trouvent leur compte! De plus, je reçois un service rapide à chaque visite Le magasin \"Pour Emporter\" collé sur le restaurant est mon arrêt #1 pour de la bouffe sur le pouce. Aux Vivres revend même quelques uns des ses plats préparés dans différents marchés de la ville. Dieu merci.  La seule chose qui manque est une terrasse."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! The vegan food is so delicious and everything just melts in your mouth. Just delectable and always busy for a reason."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I can.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I love my vegetables enough that I am very happy when I see a vegan restaurant.  I got the tofu dragon bowl (tofu, daikon, shredded vegetable with brown rice).  I wish they'd mix the vegetable a bit more.  It came in a bowl (duh), but it was somewhat hard to eat as there were a lot of shredded vegetable falling off.  So I ended up eating a lot of carrots at once, cabbage another time, etc.  Nothing extraordinary about the vegetable.  The sauce with brown rice was good though.  My friend had the tofu burger, and she wasn't too pleased with it.  Another friend got the cornbread with veggie butter and the curry cauliflower soup.  They were both very filling, and she didn't care for the pepper in the cornbread.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular.  The waitress was really slow with our service."}
{"text":"Went here twice, and had two very different experiences! The first time the service was fast and the staff were kind, however the second time I was disappointed. They have a great selection of sandwiches, salads and rice bowls. Fast and comforting food with options for anyone!"}
{"text":"Great food! Loved it a lot! Wish there would be more gluten free options tho. Staff was friendly and super nice. It takes time to prepare healthy food people so don't bit..h about the waiting. Can't wait to come back yum yum"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend, which was busy. I got the yogurt with granola. It was my first time trying nondairy yogurt, and it was actually really good. I would definitely go for one of the veggie bowls next time, which was what my friend got and it looked so good. I also got a mango smoothie; I was hoping that the smoothie was thicker though."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Aux Vivres during my week in Montreal. My dad and I did takeout for an early dinner one night. Luckily there was no line and the service was quick and friendly. I ordered the BLT on their dark bread and a slice of carrot cake. The portions were surprisingly huge. The coconut bacon was delicious after the first couple bites, but then it made my stomach a little uneasy. Still the sandwich was tasty and I loved the mayo. The carrot cake was a little too moist and the frosting didn't look fresh, but it was still pretty good. My dad really enjoyed the vegie pate sandwich and he's not even a vegetarian!   I wish I could have tried more of their interesting sandwiches/bowls. I'd definitely come back if returning to Montreal."}
{"text":"I have never been to the restaurant itself as me and my roommate have only been ordering online, but I cannot wait to find the time to actually go there. We have a bad habit of ordering food when we're tired instead of cooking (really, ask our banker, he's not very happy with us right now) but we are still trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We were very happy to find Aux Vivres and it has become our undisputed food provider for lazy days, and for others too.   We are both vegan and it can sometimes be tricky to find good, fresh and healthy food for a reasonable price. Now I won't say Aux Vivres is cheap, but the food is worth the price, and we have not been disappointed once. Not once! And we've tried a lot of different things, from their burgers to their sandwiches, their specialties to their desserts, and even their brunch! (You can tell we have a lot of \"lazy days\", I'm not even ashamed)  I have to say, one of the best thing about Aux Vivres is that even if it is considered a \"trendy\" place, your grandmother would still approve of the portions (you know, the one who keeps saying that you need to \"put some meat on those bones\")! I had a hard time finishing the sandwich in one sitting, and you can be sure that every single item on the menu will probably fill you up! (One thing to remember when you want to order dessert, take something on the lighter side before! And no, not the sandwich!)  We would recommend the Chili Fries, the Vege Burger and their brownies, especially for non-vegans eating there! Otherwise, everything else is absolutely delicious and it mostly depends on your personal tastes!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem after a road-race - absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Tried twice and it disappointed again. The fresh juices were the best things on the menu. I'm vegetarian and this did not really cut it for us. The Dahl soup was so watered down that it didn't taste like much. Just murky water. The chili tasted like they just threw a can of red beans and a can of tomatoes plus some chili powder and they warmed it up for 5 min. Three quarter of the wrap was lettuce the rest was marinated carrots. Service was friendly at first but once we got our food she never came back until the end and the place was not busy. There is potential here but I find that they need to put a bit of love in their cooking. Try Lola Rosa which is hands down the best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant végétalien est bien connu et se passe de présentation. Pourtant, je n'y avait jamais mis les pieds. C'est chose du passé, car j'y suis allée avec mon fils.   Ai essayé le bol Dragon (luzerne, pousses de tournesol, betteraves, carottes, choux rouge, tofu grillé et riz brun) le tout, bien arrosé de leur sauce dragon. Un délice, même mon fils a grignoté la salade avec moi! Essayez les jus fraîchement pressés! Celui aux pommes, citron et gingembre était très intense... en gingembre et fort en bouche.

{"text":"My wife and I recently traveled to Montreal and since she has gluten and dairy allergies this place looked like the it would be great for a visit. We stopped in sometime between 1-2pm on a Monday and it was still kinda busy. This place has a lot going for it. It's got a pretty decent size, lots of choices on the menu, friendly wait staff. Normally I would be giving this place a much higher review.  The reason for the low review is this: After sitting without any water or any word from a waiter or waitress for I thought too long a time, one arrived and I ordered the Chili Frites (without sour cream) I believe it was called. The menu said it was \"roasted potatoes with house chili and sour cream\". I was expecting a type of chili topped poutine, or a type of chili cheese fries. What I got instead was a big bowl of chili with carrot shredded to look like cheddar cheese and guacamole. Absolutely no sign of potato. It came in a generous portion but, without any warning from the waitress, it was served so incredibly hot that when I took my first bite I immediately burned the end of my tongue. Not hot as in spicy but hot as in temperature. I actually spit it out before it could burn my whole mouth. This was the first day of a week long visit and the last thing I wanted was for everything I would be eating to taste like rubber. In an attempt to cool it down I began to stir it and blow on it trying to cool it down. In doing so I stirred the little strings of carrot into it which began to cook it was so hot and when it finally cooled enough to eat, the carrot had a very off putting texture being 3/4 of the way cooked, not quite the softness of cooked carrots and not the crispness of raw carrot but somewhere in between and unappetizing. I ended up taking maybe three bites before I gave up.  The good news is the waitress boxed it up for me and I ate it for dinner that night. Truth be told it was one of the better things I ate while in Canada, unlike other things I ate on my trip, it was nicely seasoned. However, between the long wait, burn on my tongue, lack of potatoes, and unpleasant texture I can only give my experience 2 stars."}
{"text":"J'adore \"Aux Vivres\".  En plus d'y manger santé, les plats sont tous savoureux et colorés.  Un must SANTÉ à Montréal. Ils ont maintenant un comptoir/épicerie pour emporter. Quel bonheur!  Le bol du dragon est formidable! Et le pad thai, wow!   On y retourne sans hésiter, et ce, régulièrement! MIAM! :)"}
{"text":"Had the dragon bowl for lunch and it was delicious and beautifully presented! They gave me a heaping portion of extra sauce when I asked for it, no charge! The bowl itself is fairly simple, you can easily make it at home and I believe they sell the sauce. The place was pretty busy at lunch time but the service was still quick."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very pleasant waitress the moment we stepped in. I like that you have the option to either sit in the restaurant or in the cafe. We stuck with the cozy booth seating. The interior is very clean and I loved the art that was hanging up. I even walked around the restaurant to look at the prints.  The souvlaki-style seitan and tzatziki were fantastic! The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit too strong, but the seitan, cut in thick 'meaty' chunks, was flavoured nicely. The soy chai latte was tasty but could have been a bit bigger. My friend devoured her chili. The only disappointment was that her dish was served lukewarm.   I just wish that the brunch was available on weekdays; I'll have to try it the next time I'm in town.   Solid all around."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was great and the menu had a wide range of options, inspired by Indian, Greek, Thai, Chinese and Mediterranean cuisines, to name a few. I had the Sirocco wrap, which was okay, and my boyfriend had the Dragon bowl, which was awesome. I was pretty jealous. I wish I'd tried the BLT -- it's got good reviews here, and a good vegan BLT is so hard to find."}
{"text":"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #8]  A great selection of vegan food, which not only includes salads but also juices, smoothies, tempeh, tofu, burgers made from tempeh or tofu, alcoholic beverages, and rice bowls.  I needed something healthy to counter all of the poutine, pastries, and desserts that I had been eating in Montreal.  This restaurant isn't quite in downtown, but it was worth the cab ride from downtown.  It's nice to be pleasantly full, but still comfortable because the food is all relatively healthy.  Highlights: I ordered the tempeh burger, which comes with a vegan coleslaw and a side of potato wedges.  It's been a long time since I've had tempeh, and that last experience was in a college dining hall.   Eating the tempeh burger here gave me a fresh perspective - that a vegan burger patty can actually taste good.  The patty (more shaped like a rectangular slab) was very moist, unlike the first time I ate tempeh.  There was a tasty spread on the sandwich.  I liked how the burger was served with potato wedges instead of fries.  The vegan coleslaw was very light.   Critiques: Bread for the burger was just okay, in my opinion.  I also ordered a mango lassi, which was decent but average.  The drink tasted differently from what you would get at an Indian restaurant.  Overall: If you're vegan, this place is awesome.  Carnivores may still prefer real meat over the vegan burgers, but the dishes were well executed and a nice change of pace from fried food and buttery pastries."}
{"text":"This was just an okay meal for us on our trip to Montreal.  We went for lunch and the food was too heavy on sprouts without enough dressing or flavor.  The breakfast foods look more promising.  The staff was fine, just nothing that stood out to us above average."}
{"text":"Yum! Great food. Reasonable prices. Long hours. Need anything else? My two favorite dishes are the pancakes and the lasagna (take out only). So tasty!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan food, can't say enough about it.  One of the few places in Montreal I can go to and know that I can order anything from the menu.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"I guess this place needs no more PR, but we really had a great experience here.  Awesome curious menu with so much variety to choose from. All vegan, all specially made and unique enough to warrant trying. I am not vegan and it all looked really appetizing. Not bad prices either.  Got their with gf about 5pm on a Saturday. Super nice server, which surprised me as I expected passive aggressive judgmental vegans, to a degree. Ordered lentil soup, veggie pate. Both were just awesome. I had a burger, and gf had the BLT. BLT is huge, but as close and amazing to a real BLT I had ever tasted. Really good. And my burger was really good too. Though it left me with that full vegan burger feeling for a while after. We also had two Kombuchas.  Everything tasted really unique and GOOD. I'm not vegan, but if I could figure out how to cook like that, then shit I'd probably give up meat in no time.   Really great stuff. Had a great experience and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was very good and I would suggest this restaurant. I like food that doesn't taste as healthy and I have had better raw food, like Pure Food and Wine in New York City. For the price and taste, I rate Aux Vivres a 4."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Aux Vivres for years, and after the build-up, the disappointment seemed inevitable. Now, I don't like either rice or tempeh, of course being a vegan establishment, most of their menu is based on both. Sadface!  I wanted to maximize the variety of food and eat something warm, so I ordered the cornbread, a small chilli bowl, a creamsicle smoothie and a side of coconut bacon. The cornbread is not really an appetizer, it's massive, 4 sticks of bread + sauce! Umf. It's surprisingly sweet, with peppers baked in. Not at all what I expected since I come from a garlic cornbread background. The chilli was good, but not remarkable. Now the side of vegan bacon is pretty massive. Delicious, crispy, actually close to bacon in flavour, but sooo salty! I'd actually recommend not ordering it at your table and instead buying it at their store, it's a lot cheaper.  The smoothie was the highlight of my meal, and made a fantastic dessert: the taste is exactly that of an orange creamsicle, but with only vegan goodness inside.  The space is beautiful, and surprisingly homey, that being said, my waitress was surly and oddly avoidant. Minus points! I left ridiculously full, and a bit miffed. They do seem to have delicious desserts, so I guess that'd be a nice occasion to change my mind.."}
{"text":"Cute little vegetarian / vegan restaurant.  I personally am a true meat-eater, I'm all about steaks and hamburgers, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy some vegetarian delights every once in a while (that and my friends wanted to go and I didn't want to be Debbie Downer)  I started with a apple / ginger / lemon juice which was ok, but not great.  I wound up leaving half of it and just continuing with water.  Maybe had I been a bit more adventurous then I would have liked something else better?  My sandwich (the Sirocco - eggplant, humus, olive tapenade) was excellent.  It was a bit too creamy, but with those types of ingredients what do you expect.  My friend got the BLT, which is made with coconut bacon, and I wasn't that impressed.  Would have preferred the real thing in that situation!   The decor was a bit of a snooze-fest, vinyl booths and regular ol' tables and chairs.  All in all an average experience, but I'd go back again and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Nice little diner-type place that is very popular - Montreal must be teaming with veggie-people (and here I thought it was the land of smoked meat!)  The menu was heavy on the tofu, which I'm not a fan of in general, but the hummus and smoothies were both very good.  The staff & patrons are a bit on the alternative side, so get ready to show your tattoos off.  Overall, a cool spot that I'm sure is 7th heaven for true vegans."}
{"text":"I am by no means vegetarian or vegan but I really enjoyed this place. I had the dragon bowl. The sauce was soooo great! Meal wasn't too expensive and I even had the \"Gateaux au Faux-mage\" or Uncheesecake.   Very good food :)"}
{"text":"Aux vivres is a classic vegan/vegetarian restaurant with many delicious meals. As you walk in no matter the time of day it always seems to be PACKED! It's located north of st laurent. Easy street meter parking. The atmosphere is very \"homey\" and healthy. A lot of hipster/hippie people my kind of resto. It feels like a dinner but an upscale one.   I usually get one of their bowls this time I had their popular dragon bowl with tofu. DEELICIOUS. I got the tempeh before but it feels very dry and sandy and you can taste the soy bean powder after taste. You can't go wrong with the tofu. Their vinaigrette is to die for. I also shared their chilli and nachos. Loveeeeee the guacamole oh mahh goodness was it amazing. I love coming here it makes me feel Sain and healthy. They also serve alcohol but its very limited. They only have 3 cocktails on the menu and I tried the mimosa hmm kind of regret it :/ it was super sourish and bitter with freshly squeezed orange though.   Service wise: very slow at times but its understandable with the amount of orders they need to handle. The waitress was super friendly and patient. She really catered to us and came around often.   Overall, you cant go wrong with aux vivres its a fantastic little gem in the mile end of montreal fabulous and will definitely be back when I feel like being healthy again ahaha"}
{"text":"LOVED it.  Amazing Vegan food, huge portions, good prices.    The place is super crowded, we went for Sunday brunch, and luckily found a seat.  The service was super quick (if not a bit rushed, but I get it, they were busy), food came quickly, and service was good.   No complaints here.  I had the big breakfast with tempeh bacon, tofu scramble, cornbread and sweet potatoes.  Very filling, and kept me energetic and going all day.  What a treat to have the creamer be soy creamer!!  Very exciting to be able to pour cream in my coffee!!  Very exciting to find a Vegan restaurant in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"With my relatively new vegetarian preferences, I'll try just about any restaurant with tempeh on the menu. Aux Vivres rewarded me nicely.  Great rice bowls, sandwiches, smoothies, and desserts! Food portions were just right for me. I loved the BLT, buddha bowl, thai bowl, bombay banana, mango lassi, and chocolate smoothie. Food disappointments were the veggie lox sandwich (done well but not something I would normally crave) and the cafe frappe (the flavor wasn't quite right for some reason; maybe too much soy milk).  During my recent vacation in Montreal, I sat at various times at the counter, in the dining room, and on the terrace. I visited for both lunch and dinner, and never had to wait, although the dining room was often near capacity. The interior of the restaurant is nice, although the layout is quirky, and one of our tables was right below an air conditioner that gave us the chills. The servers were almost consistently friendly, and service was quick."}
{"text":"If I lived in Montreal I would eat here every day and I would be broke! Ordered the dragon bowl with tofu to go, thoroughly enjoyed it and the serving size was very generous but it was still about $14 after taxes which is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Une adresse à tester à Montréal, peu importe son régime alimentaire !  Je suis allée chez Aux Vivres pour bruncher un dimanche matin vers 11h30 avec deux amies. Première bonne nouvelle : pas d'attente.  La carte est vaste, il n'est pas évident de faire son choix car de nombreux plats ont l'air très alléchants (bowls, sandwichs, salades et autres) - je vais donc devoir y retourner pour satisfaire ma curiosité !   Je me suis laissée tenter par le brunch \"Huevos Rancheros\" avec tortillas, haricots noirs, patates douces, tofu brouillés et guacamole. C'était délicieux, frais, copieux et plein de saveurs. Le tout pour $12,95 avec un café bio ou thé chaï, donc très raisonnable.  J'ai également goûté les crêpes (pancakes) aux bleuets d'une amie, la texture était satisfaisante mais le goût de lait de soja était un peu trop présent à mon goût. Côté jus de fruits frais, j'ai beaucoup aimé le Tonique (pomme, citron, gingembre) qui porte bien son nom. En revanche, je ne recommande pas le Popeye à moins qu'on ait envie de boire du concombre pressé."}
{"text":"was amazingly delicious and i'm not vegan! i just felt so healthy but full eating there! the place is kooky and casual... need to go back"}
{"text":"Really good, different food. Highly recommend the mezze aux vivres and the chile! The tom yum soup wasn't the typical tom yum but still tasted very good.   The food arrives very very quickly and service made the experience even better as everyone was pleasant to talk too!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place. I will certainly make it a habit to stop by every time I find myself in Montreal.   They do an excellent vegan brunch (a very good tofu scramble). And the dragon bowl is pretty good (would like to see the tofu marinated). But all in all a great place. The whole experience was pleasant both times I've gone. No matter how busy they are, the staff never rushes you.  Great atmosphere, great staff and great food."}
{"text":"I admit I was a little wary of this place, which is ridiculous as I'm a vegetarian. But then I read the menu, walked in to a cute diner-y looking room with great art and music, and had a wonderful meal. It was so freeing knowing I could have anything on the menu. My little girl loved it too. Granted, she spent the whole time sucking down a mango lassi and eating a wee bit of cornbread. I did wish there were a few kid friendly options. I'm excited that we'll be here another day, so we can go back."}
{"text":"31% of Indians are vegetarian, yet for some reason it's hard to find incredible Indian food that's vegetarian in Montreal without it just being \"yeah we took the chicken out and added, I don't know, cauliflower?\"  Finally I found it at Aux Vivres. I realise I'm going to sound like a total hippy here, but I was looking for a light vegetarian lunch before my acupuncture appointment (I have anxiety, and it seemed like it might help.)  I ordered the starter Chana Paratha and a side of potato wedges with chipotle mayo.   The Chana Paratha was thick and incredibly flavourful, with more spice than I was expecting. I was glad to see it wasn't watery or weak, but instead, hearty and delicious, full of chickpeas and peas, and very filling for a $6.50 small meal.   The wedges were good, with a light vegan mayo that was a little less thick than egg mayo but still basically the same thing (you can even buy it in shops!). Pretty good portion sizes, too - I'm glad I didn't get a bowl meal because it probably would have been too much for lunch!  The service was fast despite my table being hidden behind a 4 foot wall, which was a relief, and despite being full I got a table pretty quickly.   I'm excited to come back here! It's not quite as groundbreakingly delicious as Cafe Resonance's much smaller all-vegan menu but it's definitely going in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, really. The food and service are amazing. Seriously, the BLT is as big as your head, and if you close your eyes, it tastes like real bacon. Not for nothing though, I find that a lot of the place's sauces are overly-acidic. The magnificently-crafted Thai Rice Bowl is somewhat diminished by what I see as a saucing that should be slightly thicker, and a little more \"peanut-\" Despite this, and no pun intended, this place is awesome sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent place!! Delicious food, amazing desserts, family friendly with vegan options available. Fast service with a smile. Love it."}
{"text":"Mmmmm même pour les non végé ;) ils ont un excellent comptoir de produits pour emporter."}
{"text":"If Montreal's winter beauty, adorable vintage glasses clad folk strolling the plateau, or charming architecture did not steal my heart over the weekend, then Aux Vivres sure did the trick.  During my week's visit to Montreal, trying Aux Vivres was one of the most prominent things on my agenda. It sounds silly, but vegan restaurants like this do not come around often in Canada. Vegans, picture going into a restaurant, and being able to eat anything on the menu ever. This drove me crazy. After much debate, I eventually settled for the Kosmo's Plate- an incredible array of seitan, tzatziki, potato wedges, greek salad, rice, etc. I finished off my meal with a pot of soothing chamomile, and the BEST slice of gateau faux-mage (uncheesecake), I have ever been served in a restaurant in my life. I mean that, and I have been to some pretty famous vegan restaurants in my time. That makes me sound like an old woman. I am also a vegan baker myself, and wouldn't have done much differently.  When Montreal and its charming swagger finally wins me over and I decide to move there on a whim one day, this is where I will take all of my non-vegan friends to convert them, and where all of my food dates ever will be. Aux Vivres, I might be in love with you. I don't even care if the feeling is mutual. I love you so much that you can still see other people. :)"}
{"text":"Overall we had a great experience here.  It is hard to find nice vegetarian places when traveling.  The smoothies were awesome.  The selections of items were great as well.  The one thing that was a turn off was there secret \"cheesecake\".  We asked what was in it and was told it was top secret and can't be told.  This was because people might make it at home.  I'm sorry but most people can never make the same recipe from a restaurant even if they try.  I own a restaurant and give away all of my recipes.  I am honored when people ask for recipes.  So of course we skipped dessert :("}
{"text":"Aux Vivres is a great spot- crowded- so we aren't the only ones who think so.  We needed something relatively healthy after many hours in the car travelling from the U.S. and this place definitely delivered in both taste and portion. The burgers are huge- HUGE- and really tasty. I had the Burger Aux Vivres- very veggy-y and tasted amazing. The handcut fries are a great touch as well as the homemade ketchup.   Really no drawback to this place- other than it's popular- so you might have to wait a bit before getting a seat. Absolutely would go back."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! There are not many full vegan restaurants around but this is the best one in my opinion. I had the peanut sauce tofu burrito and my friend had the \"coconut bacon\" burrito. We also had some fresh juices. I recommend the beet apple ginger carrot juice. I've been many times and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience! Le menu est très varié et l'ambiance est charmante."}
{"text":"Aux Vivres is a perfect take-out option and also a great spot for a quick, affordable and different meal ! I absolutely love their Dragon Bowl but many other great options are yours to discover ; fresh juice, vegan chili and BLT sandwich wrap (made with coconut bacon) will please even the strongest meat lovers !"}
{"text":"This place on St. Laurent needs no introduction or review. It has its own fan following already, vegans or non-vegans, everyone is crazy about it. I wonder why I forgot to review it earlier. Have been there multiple times. Perfect recipes with a huge variety and good service. It is one of my favorite sunday brunch places. They serve brunch specials with free coffee or tea. Each if their dishes are prepared with a good mix of protein, carbs and fats to start your day, in addition to being presented beautifully. I am super happy with all the wonderful vegan tasty options I have here."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant few times, to be honest with you, I am not very impressed with the food. I usually get the burgers, maybe that's my problem. I should branch out to other items on the menu. The burgers are a bit bland and dry for my taste. Last time I was there, I got burned potatoes, like pretty black on the edges. Yes they changed them but come on, the fact that they thought it was ok to give them a customer is already a no no in my books.  The restaurant itself is nice, pretty big and great for groups. The staff is lovely."}
{"text":"Francais plus bas  If somebody has to sell you that they are Vegan and that it isn't that bad and you bought it, it's most likely because you ate at Aux Vivres. I'm currently on a diet and it's tough. It's tough because I can't find what to do except boring salads and healthy sandwiches. Well Aux Vivres has a great variety in the menu. One of the complaint I always do about vegan/vegetarian it's that they hide they crave for meat by creating a weird toffu mixt simili-meat veggie version. I didn't felt that feeling about Aux Vivres. It has a heavy hippie cuisine flavour to it. Really creative vegan cuisine. Slightly asian inspired but also being audacious in some great smoothes (One with Celery, Mango and other stuff I can't remember and tasing awesome is pretty bold. Great portion an UBER-CHEAP. Which explains why it's always pacted.  Si quelqu'un veut vous vendre qu'être végétalien c'est le Paradis et que vous avez embarqué c'est parce qu'il t'as fait manger chez Aux Vivres. Actuellement, je suis sur une diete et c'est difficile d'être créatif avec de la bouffe santé quand t'as étudié en cuisine française (Beurre beurre beurre). Une des plaintes que j'ai de la cuisine Végét (Arien ou Alien) c'est l'obsession de créer des mets qui contient de la simili-viande parce qu'ils sont intrinsèquement carnivore-endormi. Je n'ai pas eut ce feeling chez Aux Vivres. Au contraire, on démontre un menu risqué mais simple avec des plats du jour. Des smoothies qui combien céleri et fruits exotiques - bizarrement délicieux. Il y a une certaine twist asiatique et même fusion mais c'est surtout de la cuisine de hippies avec une tournure bien végétalienne. Belle découverte! et VRAIMENT pas cher, ce qui explique pourquoi la place est toujours remplie."}
{"text":"The ultimate finale for my Montreal visit.  After a day of wandering around the neighborhood looking at the hipsters, vintage shops, and record stores, we decided upon a recommendation to dine at Aux Vivres.  I was starving when I got in which was fortunate because having so many delicious-sounding things was too overwhelming (when I usually get to choose from one or two options on the menu tops) so we ended up ordering an appetizer, smoothie, and dessert to accompany our main courses.  The food was incredible, the decor was adorable, our waiter gamely answered all our weird questions, and we met a group of really nice Montreal-ans who were eating at the table next to us.  Totally worth the bill."}
{"text":"So Aux Vivres has excellent food, it really is comfort food.  They make everything themselves, including the ketchup! In the week we were in Montreal, we went there 3 times just because there were so many things we wanted to try.   They have a special on every day and we tried it twice and it was delicious!   The paratha with homemade veggie butter is not to be missed and their juices and smoothies are excellent. They also sell take outs and desserts as well as their own sauces next door.   The only problems are that because the place is very popular, there is a long line up after 7pm, and the tables are quite small and close together so you end up hearing everything that happens around you.   On the first night, we had to put up with a loud couple who on top of that were rude to the server so it was off putting.   The restaurant is also quite noisy.   All the desserts we tried were amazing. I wish we had an Aux Vivres in Vancouver!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place.  Other than the fact that it's overpriced, everything about it was awesome.  Ordered the BLT that looked massive, until you go to pick it up and then it feels light as a feather.  Probably about 75% lettuce, a couple tomato sliced and some (what i think is) roasted coconut and mayo sauce (obviously not real mayo but still quite good). I couldn't tell that the latte didn't have real milk in it.  The restaurant in general looks more like a giant diner than a normal place, and service is kind of slow. If you're vegetarian or are curious about it, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Est-ce encore nécessaire de présenter Aux Vivres? Les plats sont délicieux et 100% vegan, du burger jusqu'aux desserts en passant par les bols. Un incontournable à Montréal. Si vous venez pour la première fois, choisissez le tempeh plutôt que le tofu. Aux Vivres a une façon unique de le préparer (et que j'aimerais être capable de répliquer!). Juste à côté du restaurant, il y a également un comptoir à emporter, incluant les plats principaux du restaurant et plusieurs produits d'épicerie difficilement trouvables ailleurs. À savoir toutefois que le menu pour le brunch n'est pas très vaste. Je vous suggère davantage d'y faire un tour pour le dîner ou le souper. Highly recommended overall."}
{"text":"The food here was good.  We started off with an order of cornbread, which I thought was fantastic.  I would never have guessed it was vegan if I didn't know.  The 'butter' didn't really taste buttery but I liked it.  I had a Dragon Bowl and my girlfriend had a veggie burger.  The dragon bowl was the better of the two.  I wish I had a chance to try the coconut bacon but they were all out that night.  Service was good, but the best part was that everything was pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Very good vegan place no raw food there but the staff is awesome and the food is fresh I was a little disappointed that they don't have a lot of soy free option but hey this place is great:)"}
{"text":"Première expérience vegan dans un restaurant et vraiment pas décevant! Le gateau pommes-choco etait DÉLICIEUX!!! On pourrait jamais dire que c'est fait sans oeufs ni produits laitiers! Service rapide en plus :)"}
{"text":"Simply amazing vegan food! The BLT chapati sandwich was massive - the coconut bacon definitely stole the show. We also ordered the chilli fries. Both are must-tries. You can tell everything is made with fresh and quality ingredients. A homey diner feel with bomb indie/soul music Only downside is that service was incredibly slow (worth the wait though!)"}
{"text":"Mon resto végétalien (vegan) favori à Montréal, comme plusieurs autres, j'imagine ! Ouvert depuis 1997, je suis un client depuis quelques années déjà, j'y viens lorsque je veux manger santé et je prends généralement mon plat chouchou, le ''bol dragon avec tempeh''. Menu très varié pour les végétaliens mais aussi pour tout le monde, jus frais / smoothies / sandwichs / salades / burgers / desserts...Ils servent aussi des brunchs les week-ends. Ce restaurant est toujours plein et très populaire. Déco rétro. Service rapide. Prix raisonables & grosses portions. Seul truc que je déplore, la malpropreté des toilettes, ça aurait besoin de rénover et nettoyé. Je donne quand même 5/5 car on vient ici après tout pour de la bouffe santé vegan. Ils ont une petite boutique à côté du restaurant pour acheter leurs produits.  5/5 visité en juillet 2016"}
{"text":"Vegan food and fresh juices are O.K. It will please individuals who like diner-style food. Portions are large and prices are moderate. While the food is edible and will fill you up, it is certainly flavorless. You definitely pay what you get. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"10 janvier 2013 Un saut chez les végétariens. Curieux ? oui ! Herbivore à mes heures, c'est toujours bon d'explorer et d'essayer d'autres plats, comme maman disait. De bons jus/smoothies. Je fais un saut en compagnie d'une charmante brunette asiatique. J'essaye le tonique (gimgembre, pomme, citron) ! WOW ! Un snack ? Pourquoi pas. J'essaye le sandwich Mekong (Tofu, corriande, laitue, carottes, daikon, menthe, sauce thaï aux arachides). Malheureusement, on ne goûte pas la sauce aux arachides et le tortilla géant dans lequel c'est servi ne tient pas la route avec une sauce au basilic trop abondante. La sauce thaï aux arachides, c'est pas ça. Tout se défait, ça se mange très mal. Il y a beaucoup trop de laitue pour rien. Moins, c'est TOUJOURS plus. Il faut qu'on puisse bien sentir les saveurs et qu'on puisse apprécier la croustillance des divers ingrédients sinon c'est peine perdue.  L'ambiance globale est très bruyante. C'est dommage lorsqu'on veut discuter avec une charmante demoiselle assise à notre table :-)  January 10th 2013 A jump with the vegetarians. Curious ? yes ! Herbivor on occasions, it's always good to explore and try new meals, like mom always said. I decide to make the jump accompanied by a splendidly charming asian brunette. Good juices/smoothies. I try the tonic (ginger, apple, lemon) ! WOW ! A good snack ? Why not. I try the Mekong sandwich (Tofu, coriander, lettuce, carrots, daikon, mint, thaï peanuts sauce). Unfortunatly,  you don't taste the thaï peanuts sauce within a giant tortilla filled with too much basil sauce instead. The tortilla doesn't stand, it crumbles completely and it's really messy. Thaï peanuts sauce it is not. There is too much lettuce for not much result. Less is ALWAYS more. It is premordial to be able to taste all the flavors if you want to call it a good sandwich. You need to appreciate the crunchyness of seperate ingredients in your mouth when you bite otherwise it's just a lump of anything.  The general loudness of the place is a problem when you want to sit down and talk with a charming lady, at your table :-)"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan but sometimes you just need to eat healthy without having to compromise on taste. I came to Aux Vivres for the first time today, I don't know why it took me so long to try it since I've been hearing about this place for years from friends both in and out of the yoga scene (where they are all vegan practically these days). I usually have a lot of misgivings about veggie restos because sometimes the drinks taste like grass and the food is usually tofu or tempeh done up in such a way to hide the blandness of the meat substitute. I was actually quite surprised, I ordered the mango lassi, a large vegetarian chilli and tried out their choco-banana torte and it was all very tasty. All the tables around me had food like salads, sandwiches, chapati bread and it all looked super fresh and vibrant, people were clearly enjoying their food and lingering over their lunches with their friends. The vibe here is very casual and friendly and well-lit and bright. Next time I come, I'm bringing a big book so I can read while I try their coconut bacon in a sandwich and some of their other desserts because it's so chill here."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan, but I still enjoy this place. Never ate in but ordered out a few times. I go pretty often to their little grocery store next to the restaurant.   The prepared pita wraps are good... Some very good. Steer away from the scirocco... The taste is ok but the condiments wet the pita making for a very mushy sandwich.  The desserts are decent. The salads are great. The guacamole is particularly good.  Where it felt short: the famous BLT. The first bites are good, but it is SO sweet, you will be unable to finish it. Same problem with the cornbread and the peanut sauce. Too sweet!  Why only 2 stars: they charge 34.99$ for a regular apple pie! I never complain on price, but that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm studying, I love ordering from here as they have awesome food. It's a bonus that they have several gluten-free options - very accommodating for those with allergies.  Their menu is super detailed and you know exactly what ingredients every dish includes. The portions are perfect, and the prices are super reasonable. Two doors north of the store they even have another store where they sell some of their dishes/ desserts as well as several other vegan products.  The only downside was that the service was a little bit slow, but the food definitely made up for it. I would 100% recommend Aux Vivres!"}
{"text":"We had brunch here on a weekday during a quick trip to Montreal. As we entered, we were surprised at how busy the restaurant was, but we were actually seated and served rather quickly.  We ordered: -earl grey tea  -blt wrap -Mexican soul food plate (forgot the actual name of it- sorry!)   The tea came in a pot and I wasn't given and creamer or milk with it. This was a bit disappointing but the tea on its own had a great depth of flavour, which made up for the lack of soy milk.  The BLT wrap was giant in portion size and very filling. It was well enjoyed and was balanced in its flavours and textures.  The Mexican soul food plate had chilli, brown rice, salad, and corn tortillas. This dish was gluten free and I highly recommend it. Extremely filling, delicious, well seasoned, and incredible value.   The food was served extremely quickly and managed to maintain a beautiful presentation still. The staff knows what they're doing at all times- they were very attentive and made sure every guest was taken care of.  Highly recommend for quick vegan meal with gluten free options in the city! I hope to be back to try the weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"??I've never been to a completely vegan establishment before since I'm an omnivore, but a friend of ours suggested us this place while we were visiting and I thought, why not.  Can't explain how surprised I was ?by the deliciousness of things. We only came for coffee ?and a dessert, but still. Maybe if we return some day I'll order a main dish as well (or just a ton of desserts), but for now...  ... the desserts were amazingly good (not cheap though, keep that in mind). I had the Gâteau Faux-Mage. Heavenly! Seriously?!? It was waaaaay better than a typical cheesecake you can order anywhere else.? I'd kill to have the recipe and be able to ?make it at home ?myself ?over and over. Husband ordered Apple Pie which was great as well, but the Uncheesecake got me so bad I hardly wanted to try his dessert. :)  Coffee came with almond milk and so did my Earl Grey tea. Both great.  This place has very friendly staff. They speak English and menu has two sides - French and English. What ??more could one want? I'd give them 10 stars if I could. :)?"}
{"text":"Order a Ginger Tonic as a drink. With a coconut BLT. So good."}
{"text":"Amazing Vegan food in Montreal, went here as my last meal while visiting, and had brunch on a sunday, this place was pretty full within 10 minutes of opening.  Their smoothies are amazing.  I had a complete brunch breakfast with a tofu scramble and cornbread and tempeh bacon...it was amazing, i polished my plate off in 10 minutes. The soy creamer here is also great in their coffee...decently priced, great service. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dessert and tea. Desserts were nothing special - cakes, cookies, and brownies. Was expecting something more creative. Carrot cake was a little dry but the chocolate desserts were a little better. Many other vegan options in town so I doubt I'd recommend this as a must-do."}
{"text":"First of all I'm a bit of a carnivore, but having eaten my fair share of poutine the night before I was dying for some healthy food!   Luckily on my trip to Montreal, my lovely friend and host is vegetarian and this was the first place she took me to and boy was I pleased!  Aux Vivres is bright and lively, beautifully furnished with a cool trendy atmosphere. Reminds me of a diner but with a brand new juice bar and with wooden furnishings. Tres Cool.   There's a good selection of smoothies, fruit juices, espressos, teas, organic everything - then sandwiches, burgers, rice bowls, and more! They even had a glossary of terms for non-vegans like me that don't know what Tempeh was!   I got the Tofu Burger ($11) with an Organic Soda (2.50). The Tofu burger has this great oniony/mustardy spread and it came with yummy hand cut chunky wedges with a chipotle tomato sauce, and some coleslaw. Everything was pretty tasty - but I kinda looked over and wish I'd gotten the Aux Vivre burger now!  My friend got a Souvlakian plate(?) and she said it was really good.   All in all DEFINITELY would come back here, get a smoothie and try a bowl - the food is so bright, colorful and healthy it makes me happy to not have any Poutine for awhile!"}
{"text":"Tout est bon ! Les bols dragon et thai ont ma preference mais les sandwichs le sont tout autant ! C'est toujours la lutte pour choisir entre mes traditionnels et le special du jour ! Je reviendrai (encore) pour tester le brunch !"}
{"text":"I have such a soft spot for Aux vivres. Met a special person there for the first time. Plenty of options, nice open space and Food was on point."}
{"text":"I support this place because it's fully vegan and offers an amazing menu. Nevertheless I wasn't completely convinced by the food. I ordered the Kosmos Plate, at 14.95 CAD the most expensive dish on the menu. Unfortunately the \"souvlaki-style tempeh\" didn't look or taste like souvlaki, the \"pita' was anything but Greek pita, and the potato wedges were just not good and a bit on the raw side. The only thing worthy of its name was the tzatziki. As a half-Greek I can confirm that the taste was pretty close to the original. For dessert I ordered the \"cheesecake\" but that also didn't taste of much. I'm hoping I just made some poor choices and the rest of the menu is better executed. Maybe the breakfast options or the burgers will win me over next time. I'm not giving up on you Aux Vivres!"}
{"text":"I went to Aux Vivres with my parents (who are vegan) and we weren't too impressed. The dishes had exotic flavors which I appreciated, but I didn't leave satisfied at all.  We had the dragon bowl, the buddha bowl with tempeh and the coconut blt wrap. All were okay. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"How much do I absolutely adore Aux Vivre? Enough to go daily... and twice in one day! They boast such a vibrant menu chock full of both healthy and indulgent vegan dishes, plus desserts, smoothies and juices, that any vegan/vegetarian/omnivore should be satisfied.   What I love the most:  -Popeye juice It's so gingery and refreshing! Even if you're the type who suffers through their glass of green juice if it's super green, this one is sure to change your mind.   -La Polenta (on the brunch menu-- available only on the weekend) My god, this plate is absolutely what the doctor ordered. It's hearty and delicious, with big hunks of tasty polenta over refried beans + zesty tofu scramble(cooked with nutritional yeast), perfect guac and salad (that dilly dressing is dreamy). The perfect plate if you don't actually eat until the mid afternoon when you realize you're fucking starving.   -Buddha Bowl It's simply a huge bowl, abundant with veggies, rice and grilled tofu that is out of this world delicious. But what really takes it to the next level is that ramekin of Buddha sauce (think: umami and not sweet!)  And this may not seem like a big deal to you, but their soy cappuccinos are perfection. Coming from an espresso fanatic!  This is more of a note for me and shouldn't discourage you at all, but I wasn't crazy about the the BLT because I prefer a more savory fake bacon, maybe made of tempeh, rather than the sweet coconut variety, also way too much mayo. The wrap isn't my favorite kind, but that's because I'm weird about wraps and probably shouldn't order them. But! My friend couldn't go on ENOUGH about how spectacular the Dragon wrap is and just know that it holds up to the next day as she took it to go!   Final note: The key lime pie is disappointing. To be fair, I took it to go and perhaps it just needs to be eaten immediately, but it appeared rather unappetizing when I first received it and when I went to eat it later, I found it inedible (mainly because the texture is too gelatinous). I'm sure their other desserts are much better! They appear quite enticing, for sure.  Besides the great options for all and the fact that Aux Vivre is Montreal's very first vegan restaurant (kudos, mes amis!) I want to note that I just love every waitress I've ever had here. They are the sweetest girls and really take good care of you, even when you're there, ahem, past closing (sorry to be THAT table, but thank you, Aux Vivre, for being open so late because *this* vegan often doesn't sit down to dinner til 10pm!)"}
{"text":"Aux Vivres, the staple of Vegan Montrealers and foodies alike. Originally fashioned as a sandwich and smoothie bar (and still retaining these qualities), Michael Makhan (owner, chef, menu designer) expanded to a full size restaurant in 2005.  Although the entire menu is strong, Aux Vivres remains strongest in their fundamentals: sandwiches. The BLT (with smoked coconut bacon) is a must, and the option to put it on chapati should not be an option - there is no other way to have it. Two of their seitan based sandwiches are among my faves: their Montreal smoked meat, and their gyro. I know some meat eaters would cringe at the thought of using a meat substitute in such venerated meals - but trust me, your palate will thank you.  In other options are their bowls, which while good, I'm not overly blown away by, as this is closer to something I can make on my own. The dragon bowl is probably the best here.  In their comfort foods section, their chilli and chilli fries are both great, as well as their \"Mumbai plate\", a terrific fusion dish of Indian flavours.  The only downside is that they have no alcohol license (bring your own nor table service), and the setting is just not that welcoming for languishing after a meal. But they've got it where it counts, the food."}
{"text":"Went with my wife, 2 daughters, my niece, and her girlfriend. We were seated quickly. We ordered snacks (fries, light sandwich) and then some desserts. The desserts were the real reason we went. The milkshakes were to die for. We have dairy and gluten issues in the group and they accommodated without an issue. They would have 5 stars if the service had been faster - the server quite literally walked past our table several times while we were calling out and did not come. Even when we did so in native french (as we had a couple of french as first language folks with us). But I'd be willing to bet it's an anomaly and I'll give them the next star if I go back and see different. The food and atmosphere were directly on target."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Recently I have been really into tempeh, organic food, and in the end vegan food. This is a great restaurant to convert people to the way of the bean, soy bean that is. I've eaten take out, where I mostly order the Dragon bowl. It is filling and delicious, it's a must have along with grilled tempeh.  On one of my more recent trips I order a the living salad (I think) with tempeh and it was great and surprisingly filling. To start that day we had the corn bread with guacamole, very good. I've had it with both the guacamole and veggie butter, my favorite is with the guacamole, however I think everyone must try the veggie butter. I also shared the Uncheescake Cheesecake which was very good, I am still wondering what they put in it to make it soooooo good.   If you are a vegan or enjoy eating healthy you must stop by here. If you want to bring some friends to try their first taste of a vegan restaurant, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"great place you walk out feeling UNGUILTY about eating ofcourse the sauces r fat but so what"}
{"text":"One of the most legit vegan restaurants I've ever been to, period! And I've been to many! The bowls are fan.fucking.tastic. And I'm an unapologetic omni. I could turn veg if I had access to this place on a regular basis. I love bowls with raw veg in them for some reason and they make it so, so, so, good and not like some cheap imitation of omni food."}
{"text":"The best in Ontario and Quebec that I have had. Great tasting food and reasonably priced.   Service is very good and atmosphere is pleasant for any type of outing. Always make it a stop when visiting Montreal. It is also in a great location."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this was my favorite restaurant during our Montreal visit.    First time, we ordered take out via the ala carte delivery service (like seamless in the US).  When the food arrived (Buddha bowl, a wrap and the apple pie), it was cold due to the winter weather and didn't warm us up after our long day snowboarding.  Needless to say, we were disappointed.  This was the place my best friend recommended us to try in Montreal.     Second time, we decided to give the restaurant another try in person and we came on a sunday night, the last supper of Montreal.  Surprisingly, it was packed.  The red seats and decor are intimate and trendy, suitable for a romantic date.  This time, we ordered the Masala plate (chickpea and potato curry with chutney) and the chocolate banana pie for dessert.  The entree was warm, fresh, tasty, and filling.  And dessert was delicious and more impressively, it did not leave a poor after taste as most desserts usually do.  For drinks, we had the chai; it's unique because it uses soy milk instead of dairy milk.  My girlfriend, who is picky about food, was impressed with Aux Vivres. We would definitely come back here if/when we come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for four days and ate here twice! The food is excellent, the wait staff is friendly, attentive and quick.  The polenta during the weekend brunch is AWESOME!  I'll be sure to come back on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"The lunch here is so-so but the brunches are bordering on fantastic. The veggie 'meats' are tasty and cooked just right but the soy milk they give you for the less than impressive coffee just ain't right, it curdles, YUCK!  I would have given this place 4 stars, but on my last visit, I was meeting a friend for brunch. She has a Mira dog named Joey that has to be with her at all times as he is in training. He is well mannered, sits under the table and sleeps the entire time. As he was snoozing away and other patrons were smiling at him, the manager walked over and explained that she knows what a Mira dog is and informed us that she called Mira and was told that she does not have to accept the dog into her restaurant.  No one complained about him and we were thrown out...but not before they made me pay the 5,50$ for the smoothie that I was sipping on while waiting for my friend to arrive. I was stunned that they would make me pay given that we were being tossed out into the cold because of the Mira dog and so I handed over 6$ to which she said \"sorry, I don't have any change unless I go and open the till.\"  Joey has been to restaurants all over Montreal: fancy and casual and has never been unwelcome before. And here I thought that vegans were animal-friendly, guess not!"}
{"text":"I bring all my friends here. My favorite foods for take out are :  The veggie butter is amazing and a great addition to a sandwich or just a plain bread.  Coconut bacon is an awesome meat alternative. The texture and flavor is so unique and very distinctive, you can add in your salad, to give it am extra crunch   My only issue with aux vivre is the Indian food, maybe my standard are a bit high . I have eaten Indian food my whole life and I know what it is suppose to taste like. There is little to know flavor and the chickpeas are always hard. My friends that visited me from India agreed with me."}
{"text":"Pour une cuisine vegan, réconfortante et originale, je vous conseille plutôt Antidote Café, du côté d'Hochelaga.  À Aux Vivres, mon petit copain Kevin, a pris une assiette type tempeh et pomme de terre avec salade sans gout pour masquer le manque de cuisine.  Déjà fait chez soit 5 fois plus savoureux en 10 min en rentrant du boulot.  Alors que pourtant je travaille beaucoup.  Pour ma part j'avais pris le burger vegan, celui qui te donne envie de remanger de la viande.  Si vous voulez vraiment rester vegan, allez gouter un burger chez Lola Rosa plutôt ;)"}
{"text":"It's so cool to have this in Montreal - be warned: come in starving because their portion sizes are large and the food is too good to not finish.   The fifth missing star is for a lack of attentive service."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this restaurant! Their menu is diversify and everything is good. I already taste the dragon wrap and the deluxe salad both are delicious. Even if you aren't vegetarians you will love it."}
{"text":"Stop whatever you are doing and go here. Now. Vegan or not, the food is amazing. If you don't like sweet main dishes (and I don't) avoid the dishes with the Thai peanut sauce. I found them to be horrendously sweet. However, the dragon bowl is on a higher plane of existence. I hate beets but loved them in here.   The tempeh burger is so good that I actually enjoyed the Taste and texture of it. I really don't like tempeh. The chili is warming and comforting. Avoid the chili fries. The potatoes are cut too large for it to work well. However the chili and corn nachos is worth it.   The blt with coconut bacon is refreshing and not as weird as it sounds. I've never et bacon before, so I have no frame of reference but as a sandwich the dish is a solid win.   Cheesecake is dense and rich. Carrot cake is loaded with big flavour. The mango lassi is creamy and tart but not too much like a yoghurt drink as I recall lassi to be. Still tasty in its own right. The creamsicle smoothie is exactly what it says it is.   Waitstaff are extremely friendly, and attractive. Decor is a little like a diner but still nice looking. Prices are reasonable for the mountains of food you're getting. Sandwiches are served on chapati and not bread so they are easier to pick up and eat. Not at all messy. Great place to bring a date. Just get one appetiser, one main, and one dessert to share and you'll both be pleasantly full.   This restaurant has  its act together."}
{"text":"Holy giant/cheap/delicious vegan sandwiches, batman! This is a must-do when I'm in Montreal and anyone who joins me adds it to their must-do list as well.   We were on a tight schedule so we did a call-ahead order. Hmm... there are going to be 5-7 of us eating, so maybe we'll get six sandwiches? After all, they're only about $10 each.  We picked up our order and started unpacking the sandwiches. I thought I was cutting them in half, but really I was slicing each half into a quarter. These are like giant burrito sandwiches (I would call them wraps), and one is easily enough for two (hungry) people.   As you may have guessed, six sandwiches was about twice as much as we actually needed. But it worked out, because we wrapped up the remainders and saved it for dinner to-go the next day.   Every item was tasty, but stop everything and get the BLT. Flaky and tender smoked coconut (\"bacon\"), lettuce, tomato, and vegan mayonnaise. We have smoked coconut at a place here in Rochester, but this is easily superior. It has the meaty texture of coconut, the smokiness of bacon, but still a strong sweet coconut flavor.   Get your hungry tummy over to Aux Vivres and fill it up right."}
{"text":"Bonne option santé, restaurant et comptoir rapide à l'autre porte. Jus frais, smoothies , burritos, chips d'epinard et laitue à 10$ lol ( joking ) etc ..."}
{"text":"Get the Me-kong sandwich on chapati, but ask for the sauce on the side. I'm gonna ask for that next time since the past 3 times i've had it there, it has been soaked with sauce. Also love their orange creamsicle smoothie, the chipotle brownies, the BLT, and they have a decent tea selection. Oh and lattes are nice too. Go in the summer! They have a lovely outdoor seating area, decorated with lanterns and plants and herbs. ALSO: Tegan AND Sara eat there ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to Aux Vivres more times than its worth counting for over the years. That being said, I've seen this place change somewhat radically in terms of atmosphere, food and service, which makes it all the harder to review. At another time I could count on a quality Mekong sandwich large enough to be shared between two broke folks- now I find the lunch and dinner quantities underwhelming and the sauce overbearing. Definitely not the kind of meal to be shared. This is also accompanied by a different atmosphere- it's not the intimate little vegan nook it once was.  I wouldn't recommend visiting the joint for anything other than brunch- which is the only legit. vegan brunch I can really vouch for in the city (check out that perfectly cooked polenta!)."}
{"text":"D'après mon expérience un des meilleurs resto vegan à Montréal où on peut bruncher, dîner  ou souper. Je recommande !"}
{"text":"LA POLENTA: This is only on the brunch menu. The polenta wasn't as flavored as I'd hoped it would be, but I loved this plate for brunch. It's so good and definitely filling but not in a way where you need a nap after.  DRAGON BOWL: Oh my glob, so good. That sauce though... It's a huge bowl of veggies with an amazing sauce. I don't know what kind of food they have in the afterlife, but I hope it's a shit ton of this. I want to try ALL OF THE BOWLS. Scratch that - I WANT TO TRY THE ENTIRE MENU.  THE PLACE: It's big and friendly. Is friendly a word you can use to describe a place? I don't know, but I love Aux Vivres. I want one in LA. Now. Also there's a to-go location next door. I wish I took advantage of that."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan food. Fantastic menu! Generous portions. Can't go wrong...especially when you live a three minute walk away like I do!   They have a diverse menu. Smoothies and juices, comfort food, salads, sandwiches, bowls, burgers, cornbread, chilli, and deserts. They also have brunch on the weekends which I have yet to try but it looks really tasty!   The Mexicali Plate is very satisfying for a chilly day and completely filling! It is house chili, brown rice, guacamole, sour cream, tortillas, and a side salad. It is one of my favorite things on the menu! The chili is so delicious you won't miss the meat!   Another favourite is the Dragon bowl or the Dragon sandwich. The sandwich is very big and served in chipati which is so tasty! It is stuffed with goodness: tofu, beets, carrots, red cabbage, daikon, lettuce, sprouts, and their special 'dragon sauce'. The bowl is essentially the same thing as the sandwich, but in a bowl served on brown rice. They also offer tempeh for an additional cost.   My absolute favourite desert there leaves me so happy that I get it every time and I haven't ordered any other deserts because I don't know if they will be as good as this: the chipotle brownie. It is huge! I think it is $4.25 but totally worth it. It is a chocolate delight!   I can't wait to try more of their menu!   They also offer take out but you order it in the store entrance rather than the restaurant. They have a nice little bar you can eat at in there and it has much more of a coffee shop feel than the restaurant."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: carnivore review. I know this sounds nuts, but I had one of the best BLTs of my life here. And the smoothies are totally on point. I actually went twice in one day..."}
{"text":"In a city where hot dogs, submarine sandwiches and poutine are considered staples - this restaurant appears as an oasis.  I love the menu and recommend the channa sandwich. I have had better smoothies but the desserts looked delightful and plenty of choices."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Aux Vivres for a couple of years now and every time we go there, we come out extremely satisfied. Their food as well as their service to their clientele is excellent! Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"To balance out the poutine we ate while in Montreal, we sought out some restaurants on the healthier side of the spectrum.   Aux Vivres was one such restaurant that was not only healthy but truly satisfying. My Thai sandwich wrap was really flavorful and filling, and the Creamsicle smoothie tasted sweet but not sinful.  Prices are pretty reasonable, too, with dinner for 2 coming out to about CAD$30.  Service was pretty laid-back -- for the first 10 minutes, we wondered whether we actually had a server. Perhaps they were just making the Americans chill out for a minute..."}
