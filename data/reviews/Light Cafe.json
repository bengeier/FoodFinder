{"text":"Popped in the other day to try out this place after dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. I would say that this is a complementary dessert cafe to the Stay cafe on Spadina, whereas Stay has a lot more fruit-based desserts, e.g. their crushed ice, Light Cafe's menu seems to focus on the sweet and savory.   We ordered the creme brulee trio and the strawberry ice cream waffles. Both were very delicious! However, the creme brulees should be ordered with caution as they are very flavourful and creamy. The trio consists of early gray, dusted coffee, and white chocolate as flavors. Although there isn't a precise way to enjoy this I would go from the dusted coffee and have the Earl Grey last! This is the perfect dish to share with a party of 4 + due to the sheer richness of the dessert.   As for the Strawberry waffles, they were delightful! Super airy and light unlike a Belgian dessert waffle, this is the perfect alternative to a heavier dessert place like La Creperie.  Although I didn't get a chance to experience their drinks, this place is on my regularly to-go place so that I will check those out next time. Bonus points for the modern, clean, and well-designed interior, much Instagram aesthetic! Probably one of my top places to go on a second date at, or a very prospective first date.  I would have given them 5 stars, but unfortunately, it's cash only thus far, which is kind of silly in 2016."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.   Typical Taiwanese cafe owned by five young people. Couple of them had studied at LE CORDON BLEU in Ottawa.   What is a typical Taiwanese cafe?  1. Selections of coffee, tea, slushes, and other nonalcoholic drinks.  2. Sandwiches, croissants, personal-size pizza.  3. Desserts: waffles, cakes, etc.  4. Nice deco.   Came here with husband for a light dinner. We ordered:  - House soup: mushroom soup.  - Truffle mushroom croissant.  - Grilled wasabi chicken sandwich.  - Earl grey tea.  - Cotton candy coffee.   Soup was ok. Pieces of mushroom, onions. Can be creamier in my taste; however, for a typical Taiwanese tongue, this is upto standard.     Truffle mushroom croissant is good. Croissant is freshly baked in store daily.   Wasabi chicken sandwich is decent. Tender, well-seasoned chicken.   Earl grey is nothing to rave about. Regular Pluck tea taste.   Cotton candy coffee: you get the chance to adjust coffee/milk ratio, and watch cotton candy melts into coffee at the same time.   Will I come back again? YES! This is a place for friends to chill, gather or just simply enjoy personal quiet time with light meals."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cute cafe but the only annoying thing is that it's cash only and ya girl never has cash so it's stress. But atmosphere is pretty AMAZIN"}
{"text":"Comfy atmosphere, and food was tasty! Ordered the duck breast salad with yuzu dressing  and the wasabi chicken sandwich. Both were delicious, although service was a bit slow.   The iced coffee was strong (which is good), and came in a cute serving tray with coffee-bean shaped ice cubes.   I hope they can keep their living plant wall alive, it's interesting to look at while waiting on your order. Menus were nicely designed, which I appreciate! BONUS: Snag a window seat and watch as the people lining up at the ice cream shop next door look miserable in the heat.  It's unfortunate that they accept only cash, which is rather ridiculous in this day and age. Had to pay fees at the ATM, since I don't THINK I saw a visible sign on the front door to warn me in advance...  Either way, had a good lunch, and left feeling pretty full and happy! Will probably be back to try their dessert."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place a few times and always wanted to try it out. Finally had a change to try it out this past weekend. I ordered the lobster bisque combo and my friend ordered philly cheese steak croissant.   Lobster bisque combo: tasted alright but I find it kind of bland. Food came lukewarm which I was kind of disappointed. Salad was the best out of everything.   Philly cheese streak croissant: I took a bite of my friends food, it was nothing special. My friend said it wasn't bad but she probably won't order it again.   I'm kind of disappointed with their food, doesn't taste as good as it looked. I will probably go again to try their drinks but don't think I will order food from them again. There are other better restaurants on that street if you are looking for yummy food."}
{"text":"The service was good! Loved the mushroom croissant and refreshing peach tea! A perfect place to relax and chill!  plus, the waters and waitresses were pretty hot!"}
{"text":"Modern decor and super friendly staff. Tried the truffle mushroom croissant, and it was delicious! Will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Good Taiwanese food with a French twist. Had the truffle mushroom croissant sandwich and a mango slush. Slush was a bit icey, not as smooth as I would have liked. Sandwich was messy to eat but really delicious. Fruit cup that accompanied the sandwich would have been nice except I found a short hair inside the cup.   Overall, I would come again just for the sandwich but will be inspecting my food before I injest it."}
{"text":"What a sweet place! The coffee is really good, I had the almond milk latte and it was delicious, had a nice kick to it. I started with the smoked salmon salad and it was great and the sesame dressing is worth mentioning as well.  I love the dishes at this place everything is so quaint and decadent. I've been a few times and never been disappointed :) Love the greenery on the back wall, it\s nice to see a place with fresh plants..."}
{"text":"Cute place to chill with friends, ordered the creme brûlée and was pretty good. Taking a star off because it's cash only and a little inconvenient."}
{"text":"Not bad. Only went because I wanted to take some cute photos for Instagram lol so I guess that was a success. But the food wasn't as good as I expected and had pretty small portions in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a cafe with some bomb food. Oh, but the employees were suuuuuper friendly which was a plus!"}
{"text":"A lovely cafe on the picturesque Baldwin Street. I think a huge draw is how versatile of an option it is. You can enjoy savoury soups and sandwiches or just come for dessert (or do both!). They have plenty of beverage options with several unique lattes and a fabulous selection of teas.  There is free wifi, so this makes it a great place to do some work or to just come and catch up with friends over a coffee or a meal. The aesthetic inside is perfect for any instagrammer out there. There's a wall of plants behind one of the rows of tables that brightens up the whole interior. The kitchen is open concept adding to the atmosphere.   I would recommend trying one of the teas - you get an entire pot with free hot water refills to steep as many times as your heart desires. We had the Spadina blend (as in Toronto's original Chinatown), and there are plenty other unique kinds to try."}
{"text":"Light cafe is a restaurant that serves waffles, desserts, tea, coffee and some light meals. I came here two times, and have found it good enough to get by. It's not superb, as the food quality is a bit cheap compared to their desserts. If you're coming here, eat the desserts, NOT the food. Disclaimer: they don't accept card, you need cash.  For desserts, I've tried the infamous charcoal waffles and the strawberry waffles. Although the former is def insta worthy, please go for the strawberry one instead. It tastes better, and the strawberries taste fresher.   For food, I've tried the duck salad, the hot potato dishes, and the grilled chicken sandwich. The duck salad is not worth the hype. It tastes like they use the cheap frosted duck and defrost it for serving. The grilled chicken sandwich tastes nasty.  The protein seemed like leftovers from another dish they used. Tasted also bland and unfresh. The hot potato tasted like normal potatoes you can make at home. Don't waste your money.  The service was good, but I was annoyed at the fact that they don't accept cards. They have a small shady ATM near the washroom. This is illegal and should be reported TBH.  I would come back here for the desserts, but wouldn't dare to order any of the food as they taste very unfresh and bland."}
{"text":"I've been here once for dessert and it was good.  I ordered the Charcoal black sesame waffle with a Cotton candy coffee. The charcoal black sesame waffle was visually quite different from other waffles I have had before. However, I feel it falls a bit short in terms of the amount of ice cream given with the waffle and the waffle not having that strong of a black sesame flavour.  As for the cotton candy coffee, it was definitely different in terms of display. However, I found that it was a bit too pricey for what was given.  Overall it was a decent dessert place."}
{"text":"Very cute place! Came here around 5pm on a Saturday and beat the crowd. There are signs where it could be a 2 hour wait, but since I came early it was only a 5 minute wait for them to clean the tables. They had very friendly staff that greeted right when I stepped into the cafe. I ended up ordering the fruit tea and the charcoal black sesame waffle. The fruit tea was very sweet, tasted like a warm passion fruit bubble tea and the black sesame waffle was very dry and hard. My friend got the rose tea which had a strong taste and smell of rose which was really nice. A very nice place to come with friends to talk and share desserts! Didn't get to try their sandwiches and salads, but they looked very good."}
{"text":"I got the strawberry au lait over ice and the wasabi chicken sandwich. I really enjoyed both, and they were made after a short wait. The waitress was very nice and always kept our water glasses filled. The decor was lovely and gave the entire restaurant a very calm atmosphere. There were many couples when I went, it seems to be a popular date spot. It's in a nice location, a 5 minute walk from St. Patrick station, and I'd definitely go back if I'm in the area again. They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM in case you forget."}
{"text":"Saw an article in blogTo with some unique pictures so I decided to go try. Worth the visit to check it out.  Food: Very cute and tasty. Presentation of food and drinks is great. For drinks, tried cotton candy coffee and tiramisu latte. Both came out very nice (see pics). Beware, drinks are strong which is good. The truffle mushroom croissant was delicious, fresh croissant with a noticeable truffle sauce. The bread pizza dish was less memorable, alright. Both came with a salad, chose the Yuzu sauce, it was refreshing. The waffle as well done with good pairing of green tea red bean.   Decor: Beautiful, clean bright place. The minimalist decor and feel really suits the cafe. It's very inviting to come to chat, stay and rest."}
{"text":"Light café is an amazingly bright and beautiful space to eat. It seems to serve a large variety of lunch foods such as soups, salads and sandwiches as well as some interesting and creative drinks. I had a dessert that you can get from the fridge at the counter. They have a few mousse and macaron options. I would say the food is pretty average, I found the desserts really sweet but the decor and ambiance is great. My friend had a cotton candy coffee and the ingenuity of that dish is awesome. You pour the coffee over the cotton candy and add milk. Great place for beautiful pictures and a quiet lunch. I just wish they had more of a selection of baked goods and desserts. I would rather eat food elsewhere and come here for a dessert.   Pros - decor/ambiance - service  Cons - pricey - average food"}
{"text":"Dining here really brings me back to Taiwan. The service is friendly and attentive and the interior decor is simple with an open kitchen.   The menu is not long and there are more drink options than food. I opted for the lobster roll (the picture in their menu only shows one roll, but in comes in two!). To drink, I ordered the cotton candy coffee purely for picture purposes.   The coffee was actually very flavorful, although it was hard to pour into the cup without spilling it everywhere. The milk was warmed up too, which was very nice. After the cotton candy has been stirred in, the sweetness is very subtle so if you like your coffee sweeter, you'll need to ask for extra sugar.  The lobster roll was really good too! The bread was toasted to perfection and the lobster chunks were pretty big. This came with a side salad with your choice of dressing.   Light Cafe has a very chill vibe, and it's a great place to catch up with friends over coffee and cake (which I will try next time). I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken terriyaki salad. The chicken tastes like plastic. Not pure grilled chicken at all. Reminds me of Tim Horton's fake chicken. Had to throw it out actually and added my own protein. Will stick to places like IQ that actually serve good pure chicken. vegetable soup is alright I'll give it that."}
{"text":"Great spot for a late lunch or afternoon tea with the girls. Bright open cafe with efficient service, mouth watering waffles, and perfect tea/coffee pairings."}
{"text":"This place is CASH only! They do have an atm inside the restaurant just incase. We enjoyed our meal here and give it 4.5 stars if it weren't for cash only and had good service throughout the meal I would've given it 5 stars.   My bf reserved seats for 12:45pm. He told me it was busy before 12:45 since the lunch time crowd came by, got less busy as we finished our meal. We got seated right away and was given the menu. To start off I got the cotton candy coffee cause I'm a caffeine junkie as well as wanting it for instagram (kristinerella54) purposes and my bf got the Taiwanese inspired fresh fruit black tea. We both enjoyed our drinks.  I got the lobster roll bf got the philly cheese steak croissant and we got the charcoal and black sesame waffles for dessert with added mochi.  Lobster roll was light and refreshing Im definitely glad my bf talked me into getting this cause I was contemplating between this and the duck breast salad. He liked his food but liked mine better. The salad dressing was light and delicious. I got the yuzu dressing and he got the house dressing which was a yummy tomato based dressing which kinda reminds me of a marinara type sauce. For the dessert I enjoyed the different texture the mochi gives being inside the waffle batter, it gave it more texture and was yummy paired with ice cream. Service was great but slowed down a bit closer to the end of our meal. But would definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Food was good, cafe aesthetic was pretty. Enjoyed it, but isn't a place that I would go back to again and again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, pretty good food, and nice service!"}
{"text":"Overall: The dessert was not worth the price and the waitress was rude. The food options have nice presentation, but I find it quite gimmicky.  Location: on Baldwin Street a couple minutes away from the subway.   Price: $12 for some waffles and ice cream. The waffle was probably only as big as my hand. Their coffees are also very expensive. $6 for the deconstructed coffee, which is coffee with milk and cotton candy (which is like a spoonful of sugar). Gimmicky!  Food: The sesame ice cream was decently good and we enjoyed it, however it wasn't worth the money.   Service: We were waiting for a friend in this near-empty cafe, and the waitress was very rude in asking us when the friend is coming. After our friend came, I think she was trying to redeem herself by acting extra nice. At least she tried!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite cafe - I've been here on multiple occasions and every time has been a great experience! There is a good selection of drink and menu items. I've tried the Truffle Mushroom Croissant (would highly recommend - so good!), Montreal smoked meat croissant, Black forest ham croissant, and lobster bisque - all of which have been delicious and very tasty.  Most of their dishes come with a salad where you can choose a dressing (yuzu is my favourite!) and some come with an additional side which varies from day to day (I've had assorted fruits, mashed potatoes). Their loose leaf teas come in little pots with mini pitchers of honey or milk for you to mix as you like (so cute! - the Spadina blend was very nice) and the vanilla ice cream coffee is a good choice if you'd like a cool drink (it also came with a biscuit).   Although it is more on the expensive side (~$10 - $13 for a sandwich, ~$5 for a drink) and the portions aren't very large, I have yet to be disappointed by any menu item. The presentation, decor, and atmosphere have really made my experiences here outstanding and the service has always been very friendly and attentive! I have yet to try the dessert options which I will definitely be back for at some point."}
{"text":"With all the Instagram hype around their cotton candy coffee, I took my mom and brother to check it out.  We ordered the cotton candy coffee, chicken club sandwich (with a side salad), Mexican taco baked potato and the egg and bacon potato.   We waited a lifetime and a half for our food to come. They microwave the baked potato which was a BIG turnoff for me..   Everything tasted good (minus my microwave disappointment) and the interior is cute- earthy and minimalistic.   NOTE: They only accept cash."}
{"text":"Fancy, cute little place. Food presentation is great. Dessert was a treat. The lobster roll was yummy. Great for a light meal."}
{"text":"Nice new spot on the Baldwin strip.  Came with some coworker's and had a soup and sandwich.  I had he mushroom soup if the day. It was good and size was good too.  I got the Philly cheesesteak sandwich on a croissant.  It was nice but a bit messy the cheese gets drippy.  We shared a waffle dessert that was good too.  Would be better value if they had a soup and sandwich combo in the menu as I had to order separately.  Nice decor too."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on yelp a week ago and was confirmed that my table is booked for 7 people. When my group arrived there they said we were not on the list and that they never take reservations through yelp. I showed the staff the confirmation email and he recognized that it was their manager who replied me. There was nothing they could do and our group waited 40 mins for the table.  The staff were very friendly and the food was alright. Maybe it was the weekend but it feel as though they were a bit under staffed. I liked everything on their menu and I really want to like this place. But the screw up just disappoints me."}
{"text":"Clean cafe with a live plant wall. Good place to hang and study, reliable wifi. They have charcoal waffle that actually taste charcoal-y!"}
{"text":"Does not accept credit card and does 1:1 conversion rate with USD when conversion rate is 1.34. Walked out of the place feeling really disappointed."}
{"text":"Service: 0/5. They're understaffed, wait times are long. Cash only.  Novelty: 4/5 An interesting menu with items such as early grey waffle (which we tried, it was alright), tiramisu latte, cotton candy coffee (which is coffee with a small cotton candy), and charcoal waffle (which is just waffle batter with black sesame powder). The ambience was cute.  Food and value: 3/5 The food was alrigt but a bit pricey.  Overall: it's an interesting place to try if you don't mind waiting a long time."}
{"text":"Light Cafe is a lovely cafe on Baldwin st. This place is always packed for good reasons.  They serve variety of cool food and dessert.  The decor is nice and modern and the staff working there are friendly.  The truffle mushroom croissant is very good and the smoked salmon salad was not bad.  Will def be back to check out their dessert next time"}
{"text":"A nice cafe. I had the lobster bisque which was really good. The wait took a bit of time because it was a small place."}
{"text":"This has definitely been one of the restaurants on my bucket list. I came with my friend and we both left satisfied, money wise and stomach wise.   I ordered the vanilla ice cream coffee and the truffle mushroom croissant. The latter came first and I loved the way the ice cream added a sweetness to the drink, different from simply sugar or honey. The truffle mushroom croissant came with a small fruit salad on the aside as well as green salad. The croissant was flaky and soft while there was an abundance of mushrooms with a delicious truffle mayo spread on the inside. It was light yet filling.   But it wasn't filling enough so we ordered the charcoal black sesame waffle with mochi. The most amazing part about this dish was how the mochi was inside the waffle as opposed to laying on top. This gave the waffle a soft chewy texture which accompanied the heavier flavour of sesame and sesame sauce on top. I highly recommend trying this dish when coming.   Overall, The Light Cafe has great prices with delicious foods and a nice ambiance. It wasn't too loud or too quiet. The decor was neat. The service was great. The wait wasn't long, either for a table or for food. I will definitely come back in the future to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Taiwanese cafe in the heart of Kensington Market just right beside Arctic Bites. This place serves up quite a variety of things from croissants, soups, salads, waffles, crepes to various tea/coffee drinks and smoothies.  Philly Steak Croissant - A heads up that this can get quite messy to eat but overall it was decently executed. The croissant was decent though it could have been a bit more moist and buttery on the inside. I would prefer having less cheese and a bit more onions to cut through the saltiness as the cheese somewhat overtook the rib eye steak. The mango salad as well as the spinach salad were nicely dressed.  Choco-Banana Waffles - The texture of the waffle was quite different. It was more on the stiff and chewy side versus crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. However, it does hold up well with the ice cream as it does not get soggy overtime which is good. Flavour wise, the waffle could have been a bit more intense but perhaps this is how they intended it to be.  Brûlée Latte - This is one item that fell short from the rest. The espresso shot that was pulled is not that intense and the micro foam definitely needed work. Also it came with two arrowroot cookies that was store bought from Mr. Christie which totally dragged down the overall impression.  Service was attentive for the most part and quite friendly.   Decor was quite nice in the front section. It is brightly lit as well as having one wall covered with living plants. I felt the back portion of the cafe was a bit dark and could add in more lighting and decorative items to keep the overall experience consistent.  I would come back to try the other sandwiches as well as their soups."}
{"text":"Servers on point, staff friendly smiles all around. Felt really relaxed being here for about 1.5+ hours and the staff didnt rush us at all. However the food did take about 40 minutes to arrive but once it did start arriving, it arrived quite consistently it how fast we ate our food.  The regular food was okay: the truffle mushroom croissant and the lobster bisque was good, but nothing too great.   My friend ordered the tiramisu latte but despite its beautiful appearence the taste was watered down. We were expecting something more sweet and strong in coffee flavour.  The lobster rolls were surprisingly very nicely toasted buns with a very unique and refreshing lobster filling. I would definately order this again and recommend it if you haven't tried it before.  However I'd rather order the Black Sesame Charcoal Waffles when I come here again. The waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the interior, it came with a sesame sauce dressing, a scoop of vanilla icecream, a scoopof black sesame icecream, whipped cream and a tiny slice of dragon fruit and a blackberry on one.   Id have to say that the tea I ordered went along really great with this sweet dessert we chose.  The Taiwanese Fruit Tea I ordered was so good served hot with the apple slices; I loved munching on them while I was sipping the rest of my tea. I am definately going to come back for this refreshing drink which is perfect for gloomy, cloudy/rainy days!  Thank you so much for the experience I'll be back again to try more sweets and relive the refreshing taste of the fruit tea I look forward to having again :)"}
{"text":"I literally stumbled upon this while eating at the Arctic Bites next door.  I happen to stare in and they had this cotton candy on top of a coffee cup contraption. I had to go in.  Going in with a group of friends,  I got to sample a little of everything on the menu.  The infamous cotton candy coffee,  the staple Light cafe special, the caramel Macchiatto, and my order--the peach tea (hot). Couple of notes: these are definitely quality coffee roasts.  I like my coffee bold, and this definitely delivered.  The caramel Macchiatto does not taste like your usual Starbucks Macchiatto...it's BETTER.  And that's an understatement... but then again,  Starbucks Coffee really isn't anything special and shouldn't be your coffee standard.  There was a quality fluffiness to the Macchiatto.  The cotton candy coffee is overrated... not sure what the aesthetic is besides the sugar rim left behind. I enjoyed my peach tea.... just the perfect hint of sweetness. Overall,  the prices are reasonable and surprisingly not an arm and a leg for good coffee and great ambience.  Plus no laptops and WiFi hoarders!"}
{"text":"Located in core-downtown area. A good place to have brunch with friends and families. We ordered the Truffle mushroom croissant, Charcoal black sesame waffle, chamomile herbal tea with fruits and the peach slush. Delicious meal, made with fresh ingredients. And it is a good place to take selfies as it has beautiful decorations.   Its a little bit expensive, but will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A cute cafe that is perfect for that perfect instagram shot. I heard this is a Taiwanese chain so I was excited to try it out.  We ordered a chicken club sandwich - which came with egg, bacon, teriyaki chicken, lettuce and tomato. It also came with a side salad and a side of fruit. It was good and the flavours blended really well together. The downside was the bread was a little on the 'rough' side but it was still a good decent sandwich.   We also ordered the black charcoal waffle - which came with ice cream and a side drizzle of black sesame sauce and the mixed fruit Mille-Feuille.  The desserts were good. Different from most places that have waffles and cakes. (Again instagram worthy looking food). The waffle and Mille-Feuille were good, but some improvements can be made. The waffle was a little dry and the cake was just A-OK.  The service was good but the food did take a while to make when they are busy. Another downside is they only take cash - which is typical of asian places."}
{"text":"Walking down Baldwin on a cold winter night, Light Cafe was probably one of the brightest buildings on the block, which is fitting. The windows were completely fogged up as well, so one can expect adequate heating inside.  The cafe takes reservations. As a customer, I guess it could be convenient to be able to guarantee myself some seats for whatever occasion, but it looks like it gets really busy during meal time, with lines going out the door as time passed.  The interior is brightly lit and the floor-plan is designed spaciously, with a wide path down the room lined with tables on the sides. As you head towards the back, you'll turn a corner and see an ATM before hitting the washrooms. Being cash-only, having that ATM does help I suppose. While the cafe isn't too big - seating for maybe 25 people - the washrooms are a bit small.  It is an open kitchen, so you can see them preparing all of the foods and desserts. If you're sitting beside the kitchen as I was, you could probably even sneak in some pictures of other people's dishes as they're put out waiting to be served if you wanted to fill out your menu collections without actually ordering all of them...  Menu comes with several dessert options such as waffles, mille-feuille, and cheesecake. Lots of lattes and teas to choose from. There are also meal items like sandwiches, salads, and baked potatoes.  Sitting beside the kitchen, I can see that dishes are prepared at a steady rate. However, given the number of people working in the kitchen and the number of orders coming through, expect to wait 5-10 mins during busy hours.  I ordered a baked potato with smoked salmon and caviar for whatever reason, mainly because I usually don't see an entire section dedicated to a potato. It was a good potato, with plenty of toppings. I think the flavors work well.  The waffles looked pretty good and came out in huge portions, so maybe I'll try a waffle next time."}
{"text":"Second visit to this establishment and a few things have changed.  They are cash only now and they do not mention it until you have ordered.  They have an ATM machine in the back but of course you will get hit with a higher transaction fee.  And the quality of food has gone way down.  The truffle mushroom croissant is not nearly as flavourable as it used to be and the side dish that they added is uncooked potatoes which is inedible and quite disgusting actually.  The service is prompt but really if the food is awful why bother going to this place at all.  Just too bad as this is a pretty establishment."}
{"text":"Light Cafe!!!   I was walking in Baldwin hoping to find a nice study spot at Charidise to study but the place ppl was packed so I decided to go to Light Cafe which was half full. Although it is a cafe, I thought it was more of a dessert restaurant where you dine in for dessert and their food menu. However, I needed to study. I asked the server who was super nice and she said the max alotted time is 2 hours and I could stay longer because it wasn't busy. And so I did! I got the uji matcha latte with soy milk which came with matcha and a shot of espresso. As soon as I found out there was espresso in it, I had to drink it as soon as possible because $6 is not going down the drain in fear of staying up late. It also came with two biscuits.  I loved the bright lighting and atmosphere at Light Cafe, it really helped me study and stay awake. Music is a bit loud, not contemporary pop, but wasn't bothersome. The Uji Matcha latte itself didn't have a strong matcha taste neither did it have a strong espresso taste. It was balanced. I forgot to ask if they added sugar to it as there is no sugar on the side for you to put in. But I didn't sense any sugar... which I hope is true. Matcha latte was 3/5 but service was a solid 5.  TLDR: cute bright light cafe with good service!"}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere and decor. Good presentation for drinks and food. Just had the drinks here when i visited - very appealing to the eye however taste wise nothing special. Wouldn't go out of the way to try out cafe again."}
{"text":"The food is ok, however the management is the worst. The place is cash only, and they force me for minimum purchase. I went there with my friends(4 people), and I didn't have cash at all, so then I decided just not order anything, but the waitress said like they have minimum purchase, I understood that, so I order a coffee which is 3, and she said thats not enough. I can see its not her making the rules and she was trying to help. I feel thats not acceptable. If you have minimum purchase, then set up other ways than cash only for customers to pay."}
{"text":"Innovative recipes, awesome decor, and great service make this an essential place to visit on the Baldwin Street(which is shaping up to be one of my favourite streets to dine on).   I tried the salad which was much bigger than I expected and tasted great. I also tried the ice cream coffee which was also awesome.   I'll be coming back to try so many of the other interesting items they have on the menu."}
{"text":"This Taiwanese Cafe is a great place to get brunch,  tea and dessert. Came here for a birthday date and it was great - the space was clean, well lit, spacious,  aesthetically pleasing. Service was friendly and kind. We ordered crepes and tea, both of which were delicious. Everything was presented in a very pleasing and contemporary way - details were definitely taken care of ; from garnish to plating and utensils."}
{"text":"Lovely interior, spacious seating area, however, the food and drink fell a little flat (for a cafe I had high hopes for).  Friends and I ordered two waffles (matcha red bean and charcoal black sesame) as well as two drinks (earl grey rose steamed milk and president blend drip coffee). Menu is extensive here with light lunch/dinner options as well.  We were underwhelmed by the waffles - as someone who love HK waffles for the fresh from the waffle iron, eggy taste and fluffy texture, these were a bit \"cardboardy\" and flavourless.  The black sesame ice cream was already melting when served to us, and the black sesame drizzle barely added any flavour to the waffle which basically tasted like a black-food-colour-dyed eggo.  The matcha red bean came with mochi and red bean but again the waffle itself was unappealing.  Drinks-wise, the drip was fairly smooth but we've had better.  The earl grey rose steamed milk tasted like a regular London Fog with some rose petals on top for presentation (but added no additional flavour).  All in all the pricing is fair for a dine-in in the McCaul area, and I would recommend it as a place for studying given the interiors but there is definitely better for food/drinks."}
{"text":"I don't think I've EVER been so excited to write a review before. This cafe was breath-taking - from outside on the streets looking in, the cafe has a very minimalistic yet open design. Glass doors and open kitchen allows the cafe to appear as though it's more spacious, the *real* plant wall on one side of the cafe makes the place look a lot more alive (lol). The decor is simple yet everything is so meticulously designed. Me being a girl who loves pretty things, I fell in love with the cafe before I even got to sit down and try anything.  Saw a BlogTo post a few days ago about this cafe and HAD to come for a visit. Dragged my best friend here on a Saturday afternoon (around 4 PM) with no reservations thinking that we probably came at a more low-traffic time but nope, there was a lineup crowding the entrance and we were told upon arrival that the wait would be approximately 30-50 minutes. With that being said, we didn't come all the way here just to turn around and leave so we decided to just wait it out. The wait took about 30 minutes which wasn't so bad as the place was packed.   Upon sitting down, we were given this adorable newspaper-themed menu. At first glance, you can tell they prepare every single one of their dishes and desserts diligently. Everything just looks so good and you just have the urge to try every single item. They had a large selection of desserts and drinks which made it so hard to decide on what to order. In the end my friend and I both ordered the lobster bisque combo, a strawberry waffle, and a charcoal waffle. What I DIDN'T like about the service was that it seemed like they were a bit under-staffed. It looked like only two servers were on the floor and the food prep was longer than I had expected. After ordering I remember thinking that I had forgotten to ask for the soups to be served first, then the dessert. But I didn't bother mentioning it to them after because it was so hard to wave them down and I figured they probably knew that anyways. However they gave me the strawberry waffle first, then the two lobster bisques, then the charcoal waffle which in my case was exactly what I didn't want. Bad on my part for assuming that they would serve food first like other restaurants and cafes. My strawberry waffle ended up melting by the time I finished my soup and the waffle part wasn't very warm or crunchy as I had hoped for. The lobster bisque was so good - one of the best I've ever had, and the salad it came with was fantastic too. Still very pleased with the food and desserts nevertheless.  Apart from the long wait times and slow service, I loved my experience here and this place definitely has a spot on my list of Toronto go-to cafes now. Although the prices are a bit steep, I'm willing to splurge when they put this much effort into making their food look good. Everything from the food, the desserts, the drinks, and the decor of this place is so aesthetically pleasing. I will definitely be back soon (with a reservation) to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I had heard that reservations were recommended here so I made a booking for us four for 6 p.m.  When we walked in that night, there were indeed a lot of people there already and I'm glad that we had a table available for us right away.  After we placed our orders, the items came out in a staggered fashion.  For example, my dessert came out first, followed by one quickly.  However, the next two desserts took a while even though another friend had ordered the same thing as me.  D was the most disappointed because hers was last to arrive and by then, we could have been halfway done our desserts already.  Perhaps Light Cafe can work on timing to bring out all the desserts out at the same time knowing that we were ordering separately and not sharing desserts?  I ordered the Charcoal Black Sesame Waffle.  It came with a scoop of black sesame and vanilla ice cream in a small dish.  The highlight of this dish is that all of the waffles are shaped like hearts.  There was also a mini pitcher of black sesame sauce to drizzle over the waffles.  There was a piece of dragon fruit and one blackberry on some whipped cream too.  I really enjoyed the black sesame ice cream! It was really flavourful. However, for L's portion, it had started to melt really quickly, which was a disappointing part because she detests melted ice cream.   I thought that the waffles were pretty good; they were not too mushy or hard and were easy to eat through with the ice cream and black sesame sauce. It was a lot for one person though and I even gave one waffle heart to my friend.  I tried the Strawberry Mille-Feuille that C got and it was quite good!  It looked like a pastry tube with cream and strawberries on top, a scoop of strawberry ice cream, and a pipette of strawberry sauce.  The pastry was really flaky.  D got the Choco-Banana Mille-Feuille.  This was also a pastry tube with chocolate sauce, bananas, chocolate, and a pipette with chocolate sauce instead to drizzle on top of the dessert.  It was very rich.  Overall, I'm really glad that I got to try Light Café finally.  All things considered, I thought that it was a really cute café, definitely fit for instagramming due to its aesthetically pleasing creations and modern stylish environment.    Also, I think that if Light Café wants more business, perhaps they should provide credit and debit payment options too instead of just cash only.  (They have an ATM on site for which service charge is $3.)"}
{"text":"My experience at the Light Cafe wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  The decor is cute and simple.  Added onto this is the fake greenery on one of the walls, which makes it a great back drop for IG photos.  If you visit, try to cop one of the seats in front of this wall, so you can snap away!   The food is a fusion of western and East Asian elements.  The prices are fair since the cafe's in the downtown core.  Taste and portion wise, the fare here is very similar to other East Asian fusion dessert establishments.  Nothing really stood out to me, so I would say give it a try yourself, but I would be on the fence about recommending it over other cafes.   Pros:  - charcoal black sesame waffle is super trendy  - food is plated well with cute utensils/bowls/pots - cute and IG worthy decor - staff members are friendly  - great lighting  Cons:  - only one server at a time, so you won't get prompt service - waffles were dry and bland  - menus aren't laminated, so they're hard to clean (bacteria concerns) - nothing stood out in terms of flavour for all the items we tried"}
{"text":"They've changed. Last summer when I first  went there they were much better. The salads were perfectly dressed and I loved the Yuzu dressing. The food was delicious, especially the truffle mushroom croissant and the Lobster Bisque. When I dropped by yesterday everything was too sour, including the croissant and the salad. They had run out of the Lobster Bisque so I had the soup of the day instead. It was more watery than a porridge. I'm disappointed and hope that they'll pick up their game again. They were so good..."}
{"text":"They take CASH ONLY! They do have an ATM at the back of the store if you forget to bring cash.   I ordered the Grilled Wasabi Chicken Sandwich and the Kiwi Slush. My friend ordered the Truffle Mushroom Croissant and Cotton Candy Coffee. The Grilled Wasabi Chicken Sandwich is juicy and very flavourful. I do wish they had spread the wasabi on more evenly as I did taste way too much in one bite and none in another. I had a bite of the Truffle Mushroom Croissant and boy was it flavourful! A lot of other reviewers have raved about this too so I'd probably be back to try this for sure!   The Kiwi Slush was packed to the rim, it pretty much overflowed from the glass as I was taking pictures - whoops! The drink was not overly sweet, it had more of a tart flavour, as you expect if you used fresh kiwis.  The cotton candy coffee itself is straight up black coffee topped with a ball of cotton candy, which does not really sweeten up the drink at all. It is very bitter, so if you're not a fan of black coffee ask the staff for sugar!   Would I come back? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We came here right at noon and were the first ones there. However, within 5 minutes people started coming in that eventually it filled up the café.  Even though I knew their cotton candy coffee was nothing special but I still wanted it. It's a cute concept. I heard their truffle mushroom croissant was delish so my bf and I both ordered it.  Our food and coffee came in a timely manner. The mushroom croissant was absolutely delicious! But it can be a bit messy to eat, so do use the knife provided! Their salad dressing is really good, I chose the yuzu dressing and it made the salad very tasty.   Definitely recommend this place, however they only accept cash which sucks if you don't carry cash all the time!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere of the cafe was very modern and great for Instagram photos. My sister and I were were excited for the food, so she tried the mushroom, pesto and asparagus \"pizza\" and I tried the lobster rolls.  The \"pizza\" was just a piece of garlic toast loaded with mushrooms, pesto, cheese, and asparagus. Nothing too special. It came with a salad and fruits, which was a nice addition.  Originally, I was hesitant to try lobster rolls since it's a little on the pricier side ($14), but they were very delicious! I could taste the lobster bits. It also came with a salad and fruits. The yuzu dressing is a must try!  My only complaint was the VERY slow service. We waited almost 30 mins for our food, and it wasn't warm when the dishes came out. On the plus side, the waitresses were very polite and attentive to our needs!   I'll probably return when the communication between the kitchen and waitresses improve to try their famous Cotton candy coffee !"}
{"text":"Very cute little cafe with the cutest interior! Love the lights and vertical garden, its the perfect place to come on a date or just to study!   I got the iced peach tea and it was the perfect sweetness and the fruits were a nice touch. The mushroom truffle croissant was DELICIOUS!! And the salad with the yuzu sauce was light and tangy. Service was great and they gave us 10% off because the wait was longer than usual, it was very nice of them. The only small complaint I have is that I could smell the garbage from the back, it was very strong and unpleasant, hope they don't open it next time with customers in the restaurant.   Overall very good!"}
{"text":"Thanks to BlogTO for finding this awesome Taiwanese cafe. I give it 4 stars solely on the food. -1 for service, I'll explain in a moment.  Let's start with the food! My boyfriend ordered the lobster roll which was two slices of bread toasted and made into a hot dog bun lookalike. According to him  it was \"godlike\" He had nothing but good things to rave about for this dish. A little more on the expensive side (14/15 bucks)for 2 rolls but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the wasabi chicken sandwich. I'm not sure why I wanted to die, but at that moment in my head it seemed like a good idea. Definitely filling, with tasty chicken pieces and lots of lettuce. Simple dish, but decent. The mains came with salad (I chose house dressing...it was pinkish red!) and small bowl of fruit which was pear and orange.   I decided also on ordering a matcha smoothie...holy...it might as well be a meal in itself! It towered high, topped with a garnish of mint leaf. Tasty as heck though, but I could not finish it. I was a trooper though and got close ish to the bottom of the glass.   Now, why I did not give 5 stars is the service was extremely slow. Although, there was only one server...could be why. However, I felt the cafe did not handle the rush period well. I think kitchen staff was sufficient, they had 3 cooks. But for server...nah. Just simply not enough with only one. Overall great place to try. Pretty new establishment as well. I totally recommend."}
{"text":"Located in a very nice neighbourhood with Arctic Bites and Kekou around. Atmosphere and setting of Light Cafe gives me a Taiwanese Cafe feeling with very pretty decor and natural lighting.   When my friend and I got there on a Thursday afternoon for late lunch, the cafe was pretty packed already.   We order a Smoked Duck Brest Salad and you get to pick your choice of salad dressing out of 4 different kinds which were: yuzu, sesame, mustard soy and their house special (strawberry vinaigrette). We got the sesame dressing with the salad...it was AWESOME!  We also got the clam chowder soup on its own. It was actually very overpriced considering the quality of the soup. The soup was $5.75. So we thought that could be a skip.  Ordered the Lobster Rolls which came with a little bit of salad and fruits. It wasn't bad but I probably wouldn't order it again.  Lastly we got two coffees, the Light Cafe Special and Cotton Candy Coffee. They both came in big plates and super nice set up. However, I feel like it was just normal regular coffee but no doubt they were super cute and creative.   I feel like the cafe is a little bit over priced for the food and coffees provided. However, it has really nice ambience and atmosphere. A great place for friends to chill!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute, right on the edge of Kensington Market, a little hidden in plain sight (I walked past it by accident because I wasn't paying attention). They have a cool green wall, and all of their dishes are pretty cool (and instagrammable). I had dessert here and shared a bunch of different things with friends, Charcoal Black Sesame Waffle (so cute, heart shaped, crispy on the outside), Choco Banana Mille Feuille, and Coffee Creme Brulee. They were all quite good but I think my favourite was the Choco Banana Mille Feuille! Everything served here is presented very carefully and in a cool/different way, which was pretty awesome. I would love to come back and try savoury dishes to see how those are presented as well."}
{"text":"The decor is amazing. From the plant wall to the lights hanging from the ceiling, everything about Light Cafe is really cute. I went there on a Saturday afternoon. It was quite busy, and we had to wait 30 minutes to get a table.   Once seated, we were given menus (super cute!!! fit with the aesthetic) and I ended up getting the strawberry waffle (a classic) and the earl gray rose latte. The waffle was delicious and had an amazing presentation. If you're planning on going, you have to get the waffle. Perfect for sharing.   Aside from the long wait, this place is great! It's a cute cafe that's perfect for catching up with friends or going on a nice date. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you ever want a chill place to relax but with some menu items that will wake up your tastebuds and take you to a whole new level, this is the place to come.   I tried the black bean waffles with vanilla ice cream and sesame sauce. The waffle has just the right amount of sweetness when you add a little dab of ice cream to the top and the sesame sauce has a certain aroma that just compliments the tastes so well! I've tried the Italian sodas and they are a bit pricey but for the presentation and fresh ingredients, it's well worth it.   I've taken my dad and then my grandparents and we all loved it!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY CASH ONLY  Lesson learned, their ATM machine cost me $3 to take out cash...sadface  But I enjoyed their mushroom croissant for lunch. They have a nice, cute selection of dessert, which adds to the competition of the infamous Baldwin street with a variety of yummy food and desserts.   The cafe is cute and instagram worthy. They even have a sign that it could be up to 2hr wait, so this place is easily packed."}
{"text":"I went there to get an Americano to go. It took 20 minutes tasted mediocre and came in a small cup. The staff were not particularly rude or polite."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with very friendly service. Food presentation is excellent, but the taste is only just ok, and the portion too small for the price point. Oh, and *** CASH ONLY ***, which is annoying.   We ordered the lobster bisque combo, mushroom truffle croissant, and the Philly steak croissant. The lobster bisque didn't have much lobster taste. The mushroom truffle croissant had way too much mayo sauce. The Philly steak croissant had a huge amount of this cheese whiz sauce that I didn't like. However, the croissant itself was nice and flaky and the roast beef was tender and delicious.   Unfortunately, the portion was too small that I'm now writting this review as I'm waiting for my 2nd course at Kinton Ramen next door."}
{"text":"When the weather is this hot, I crave lighter food options and refreshing cold beverages. Looking through the businesses I had bookmarked on Yelp, hubby and I decided to dine at Light Cafe. First of it, it is a beautifully decorated, clean, bright space with a vertical garden, cool light fixtures, and a nice open kitchen. There is plenty of bench and table seating. Their air conditioning was heavenly given the weather.   After coming inside from the scorching afternoon heat, my first order of business was to order a cold drink. Unfortunately they were out of matcha thus the cold matcha latte wasn't possible, so I went with an iced peach black tea. They serve premium locally sourced bespoke Pluck tea. This was served in a nice tall glass, garnished with fresh fruit and pieces of (likely bottled or canned) peaches. Refreshing and delicious!   They serve mini pizzas, sandwiches, and salads as part of the menu. Sandwiches and mini pizzas are served with a small salad and a mini cup of fresh fruit. I ordered the smoked duck salad which was both beautiful to look at as well as delicious in flavours and textures. There was the slightest suggestion of maple flavour (to my palate) in the duck breast and this paired beautifully with the light citrusy yuzu dressing (thanks fellow Yelpers for the tip!). Hubby ordered the truffle mushroom croissant sandwich, which was also really yummy and surprisingly lighter than I expected given the creamy sauce. I appreciated how they have taken the time to use nice glassware and wooden trays and dishes which further enhances (at least for me) the dining (and photographic) experience.  They have a number of mini desserts on display (the pistachio crunch cake caught my eye) as well as a number of unique beverages including cotton candy coffee (which is Instagram worthy but probably not something I'd enjoy drinking as I expect it to be too sweet). They also have some great looking waffle and ice cream options on the menu for those craving a sweet treat.    Light Cafe is definitely recommended if you're looking for light meals, or a cool place to hang out with friends over drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Light Cafe is a cafe that has plenty of natural lighting, decor is an instagrammer's dream! Marble dining tables with cute lights hanging from the ceiling and a faux green space in the background give an atmosphere where you're whisked away to an afternoon in Europe.   I've been here on two separate occasions: 1st time with my SO and the second with a close friend of mine after grabbing a drink.   Menu: the menu is extensive - with a range of hot foods, sandwiches, salad, and desserts. Mini pizzas and sandwiches are both served with a choice of 2 mini salads served in ramekins. Their yuzu dressing is the perfect accompaniment to the bitterness of the mixed greens. I got the cotton candy coffee and I felt that the coffee was more on the watery side. I did it for the gram... Black sesame waffle was my favourite and I really enjoyed the strong sesame taste of the ice cream. Next time I come here, I'd like to try their fruit teas and the mille feuille   For someone who is paying close to $20 every time she comes here, I would expect service to be more attentive. During peak hours, there is only one server, and needless to say, he's not the most attentive (although attractive..) Min. spend of one drink or one dish to detract from those just sharing a plate."}
{"text":"Ordered this off Uber eats   Lobster bisque - watery. Zero lobster, had lots of red pepper??? Gross.   Lobster risotto - I think they poured the soup onto some rice. Disgusting.  And $18. Rip off.   Lobster roll - mediocre and the bread was hard   Pulled pork baked potato I didn't try but boyfriend said it was good.   It was $70.00 for these items and NOT worth it"}
{"text":"This is such a cute place for either lunch and/or desserts. There's a huge selection of food, desserts & drinks. Must order the truffle mushroom croissant and charcoal black sesame waffle!! Both are worth it! Definitely want to come back to try more off their menu."}
{"text":"On the day before leaving to HK I finally checked this cute cafe off my list!!  Interior was modern and bright! We went right at 12pm so we were their first customers. The place smelled like puff pastries, made me extra hungry after sitting down  The croissant was hands down the best! The layers were so flakey & crunchy, messy to eat (yes don't eat this on your first date) but absolutely delicious! Flavour wise the truffle sauce was not too overpowering and did not cover the original taste of the shimeji mushroom (one of my fav mushroom!! )  As for the wasabi chicken sandwich, the soft bone in the chicken added some nice crunch but I think the wasabi flavour could be a little bit stronger  The fruit tea was a nice alternative since I didn't want coffee, came in such a nice teapot! Friend said she wants to get one for herself xD  {to try next} the lobster bisque & the lobster roll!"}
{"text":"Favourite place for me and my friends to eat at for dessert or lunch, the price are decent and the servers are very kind. Would recommend people to come here to try it out"}
{"text":"Stylish cafe with a nice, quiet atmosphere for catching up with friends or working. The coffee isn't special but the way they serve it is. Everything is beautifully put together, a feast for the eyes. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! I thought this place would be over hyped since a lot of my foodie friends have been here and I've seen all the ig pics. I can't say the food was MIND-BLOWING but I would definitely come again.   Went here to try the strawberry ice cream waffle - it's a lot of dessert (but not so much that you won't finish :P). They definitely do not cheap out on the amount of ice cream lol. I also tried the earl grey rose latte which was super yummy and not watered down at all. My friends had the mango waffle and the truffle mushroom croissant and enjoyed them very much. I really have nothing bad to say about the food!  A tiny downside is how long you potentially have to wait for your food to be prepared (20+ minutes for me). But again it won't affect you much if you're just chilling with friends!"}
{"text":"This taiwanese inspired new age cafe is absolutely adorable. Their decor looks like something straight out of Instagram/Pinterest: clean and bright with a lush wall of green vegetation. Their food is just like the decor: very aesthetically pleasing.   I've tried their mango and strawberry waffles, their mushroom and asparagus baked potato as well as their taiwanese fruit tea. Both waffles were super delicious and the presentation incredibly adorable. They were served with, in both cases, fresh fruits, ice cream and fruit sauce and turned out to be perfect to share! The baked potato was very yummy as well, very flavourful and not too oily."}
{"text":"Nice cafe in downtown. It is so pretty! Worth the travel to DT. We had salad, spaghetti, waffle and Taiwanese tea."}
{"text":"Environment 4: decoration is nice, the seat is hard and not too comfortable. I think they dont have heater.. it was kinda cold 2 weeks ago in store.  Food&drink 5: I love the duck salad, drinks are also creative and healthy. Its pretty cheap too What disappoint me was the cash only issue, they dont even take debit, i think thats really inconvenient and they should at least put that msg at the door. BTW, there is a 2hr seating limit sign at the door for a cafe"}
{"text":"The interior is comfy + modern and insta-worthy. I tried the cotton candy coffee and the charcoal black sesame waffles and both were underwhelming. The coffee, lukewarm and bland. The waffles? Hard. I suspect the waffles were pre-made and were left out too long causing it to dry out. I bit into it and got a little cut inside the roof of my mouth.. yup. I haven't tried the brunch menu but maybe I'll come back if I'm around the area. Not worth the hype imo."}
{"text":"I finally get to try Light Cafe!! Came on a Saturday night at 630 and surprisingly it wasn't too busy, but that Saturday was like -20, so it could impact people's willingness to go out.  Came with a group of 5 people, so we were able to try many dishes.  I ordered the Light Cafe Special Coffee and the Lobster Roll.  The Light Cafe Special Coffee was very interesting, it came in two huge test tubes, one coffee and one milk with nice cups and brown or white sugars cubes for you do DIY your coffee.  I really liked this concept and it was VERY Instagram worthy and as a bonus, I was very happy with the coffee taste, it was perfect for me in terms of the bitterness level.  The lobster rolls took a while to make, but it did not disappoint at all.  Two lobster rolls and the lobster portion was generous and fresh, the breads were also toasted to perfection.  The side dishes, potatoes and salad with Sesame dressing were amazing as well.  Out of all the dishes we ordered, I was super impressed with how the Philly Cheese Steak Croissants was displayed.  It was beautifully displayed and apparently it was super delicious too! I really regretted I didn't steal a bite, but I'll go again next time to try that and order some desserts.  4 stars for now because I still need to try their wide selection of desserts and will update review once I have it."}
{"text":"Coffee sweetened with cotton candy ...so innovative and so delicious. The place was also super clean and spacious. The price was a fair and you absolutely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, solid food (their yuzu dressing is the bomb!), friendly and attentive service, reasonable price (everything under $13 except for the lobster roll. Check out their website for full menu). The only complaint I have is that they ONLY accept CASH, not even debit.They do have an atm machine in the back though in case you forgot to bring cash.  My boyfriend and I came here for their grand opening event. We got 25% off (their promotion). The quality of the food and service was beyond our expectations. We wouldn't have minded paying the full price. With that being said, we can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu. We got a Montreal smoked meat croissant sandwich, a wasabi mayo grilled chicken salad, and cotton candy coffee. Both sandwiches came with salad and a side that could change depending on the season and what they have in the kitchen. You get to choose the dressing for your salad, and trust me, their yuzu dressing is SO GOOD. The croissant was buttery and flaky. They give you a generous amount of chicken breast (very moist). We enjoyed both dishes. The cotton candy coffee really was just for the experience. They also give you chocolate covered coffee beans to finish off (the menu said coffee beverages come with biscuits or you can substitute with a macaron for $1.5. I assume chocolate covered coffee beans were just for the grand opening event).   Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone! They also participate in Ritual which is an app that you can order and just pick up the food without lineup! (use the promo code KATIE8981 to get $5 off each of your first 2 orders!). But only savory items, baked items, smoothies and slushes are available for take-out."}
{"text":"I've had high hopes for this place as it was near my school and I've seen it multiple times on Instagram. All of their dishes looked great, but the charcoal waffle particularly stood out w/ its sleek black appearance. And visually, it was Insta-perfect when it arrived, but the taste was a different matter.   To start, the batter was really dense & dry; to the point that I found it hard to chew & swallow. It was bland as well, and the ice-cream similarly lacked flavor. As for the sauce, it was basically a watered-down version of the Chinese black sesame soups (???). I honestly finished it just b/c it wasn't exactly cheap.     Given the lack of quality for the price, along w/ the wait time (35mins), I doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is decent and reasonable price , portion is a bit small but good for a light lunch .  Service is excellent.  Good oasis for lunch"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and boy, does it remind me of little HongKong. Not only does this cute little cafe remind me of it, the exceptionally nice customer service brings back memories. I loved how the menu looked, it was eye-catching and the actual plating looked like how it does on the menu (you'd be surprised how different the menu vs actual food would look like @ other places). I had their cotton candy coffee and it was less than $5 USD! If this cafe was in the states, it would've easily been $7.95 or something like that. The concept was adorable but I wish the coffee didn't taste so burnt. That was a bummer. Peach ice tea was yummy and I love how they put so much thought into it with the visual display. Their duck salad was amazing as well; pairing with the sesame dressing you'll be very pleased. Also tried their Mexican potato. UGH, I wish I didn't end up getting only the half portion. GET THE WHOLE THING, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday night after dinner on Baldwin.   I ordered a hot chocolate for $4.75 before tax. Was it the best hot chocolate I ever tasted? No, but they pay attention to the details. It was served with a curved spoon and a mug that has a handle that wraps around the hot chocolate itself. The spoon was placed on the right side of the plate and the mug on the left.  The entire top of the hot chocolate was covered in melted marshmallows with a dust of cocoa powder on top. I prefer my hot chocolates to be not sweet as this was the case. It was just the right amount of creamy sweetness.  The price of a medium (or grande for Starbucks lovers) hot chocolate is high for this place, but it is a cafe for hanging out with friends and catching up. We stayed for about 2 hours with each of us ordering one drink.  This is a cash only place so make sure you have some cash on you (ie. they do not accept debit or credit)."}
{"text":"Combined with the living wall, the natural lighting, and delicious yet light food (think the mushroom truffle croissant), and good cup of coffee ( i like the drip coffee), i can easily spend a relaxing afternoon alone or with friends here!!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of this cafe while I was in Taiwan but it sure reminded me of something you'd find in the Taipei cafe scene!   The decor here is amazing! Love the lighting and the \"earthy\" feel. It's similar to Jule (on College).  The FOOD omg..amazing!   We had the...  -lobster soup combo with garlic bread and salad: so good! It's a creamy chowder soup but unlike a lot of the ones you'd find out there, this one is surprisingly not overly salty! It's definitely creamy enough and actually refreshing when you dip the Gaelic bread into it.  -Mushroom croissant with garlic bread and salad: their SAUCE is AMAAAZING! I was so surprised that this didn't have meat in it...as I'm a huge meat eater..but it tasted so good!   -Matcha waffle: The inside of their waffles have mochi filling. REAL MOCHI! It's super chewy. The ice cream was too creamy (like the cream you'd put in coffee) to eat alone, but paired with the waffle was amazing.   -Cotton Candy Coffee: Don't think their coffee is anything special, but it's interesting they used cotton candy as the sugar substitute. Definitely photo worthy (mainly why we ordered it)!   Price? Super decent! All their dishes are around $10-$15.  I'm gonna definitely gonna be back again...might even become a regular customer! So good to have a nice Taiwanese cafe in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is a cute cafe in a cute neighbourhood. The food and coffee is average but presentation is fantastic. They spare no expense in using all kinds of wooden trays and spoons to make sure every item photographs well.  I enjoyed chatting there with a friend, the environment is great. I would come here again."}
{"text":"TLDR: cash only, try the coffee, touch the wall garden, amazing food.  Good coffee, lunches make me feel healthy, decor/ambience is simplistic with a touch of hipster - definitely my place.  It's spacious, white everything, and there's one wall where it's a growing garden forest thing. LOVE it.   As a student looking for some healthy food, this is the place to go. They have very appetizing and filling salads (get the sesame dressing).   I've tried a bunch of things (lobster bisque, grilled chicken breast salad, roasted mushroom salad, smoked duck breast salad, smoked salmon and caviar baked potato), but my favourite has to be:  Bacon and Oesen Egg Baked Potato (9.5) - so savory and so good. All the protein, and all the veggies (potato is a vegetable right?)   Cotton Candy Coffee - ya like all the photos on here, this thing was so bomb. More of a novelty, it's cool to have just once to see how the cotton candy dissolves so quickly when coffee is poured on it. Also it looks like you're doing an experiment so you look real cool.   One star off because of cash only and that the wait for food can be quite a whole (~20 minutes) at times.   Will definitely be back to try all the sweets!"}
{"text":"Light cafe gets 3.5/5 stars (I rounded up) haha. I've seen photos of Light Cafe on Instagram and decided to give it a try with my friends. Service was good enough for me but my friend wouldn't agree because it took her forever to get her drink. It also took her a long time to flag a server down to ask about her missing drink.   The interior of the cafe is very warm and cozy. It reminds me of the cafe they have at the bottom floor of Taipei 101. They had a wall of leaves at the front of the store. Too bad we were seated at the back - we couldn't take pictures with the wall as a background. This place is great for a hangout with friends / date. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you have a big group of more than 6 people though.  DRINKS: * CHOCOLATE AU LAIT ????? (2/5) It was cold D: Why was it cold D:  2 points for the taste because it was actually yummy but it was supposed to be a sizzling hot drink, not lukewarm.   * COTTON CANDY COFFEE ????? (3/5) You should order this for your Instagram photos. As for taste, it tastes like any other coffee. You'll be paying $6.25 for the love of photos haha.  TRUFFLE MUSHROOM CROISSANT ????? (4/5) (Sauteed mushroom, beef, tomato, lettuce, truffle mayo & butter croissant) Light Cafe got most of its stars from this croissant! It's yummyyy!! Love the truffle mayo, they put a lot in the croissant (even the corners.. yay!). This dish has salad and fruits as a side. This is like a dinner portion to me because it was very filling."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for a little awhile.  My friend and I went to the ROM, and this place was a brisk walk away.  We got there just before it opened, but their doors were open.  The waitress said we were welcome to sit but they were still getting the restaurant ready.  It was nice of her not to make us wait outside in the cold!    It's very bright and inviting.  An adorable spacious cafe, with a beautiful living wall.  I really liked the menu selection.  There were a lot of different choices, and unique options that you wouldn't typically see at a Cafe.   So many things I wanted to try!  I ended up with a pizza, latte and a waffle for dessert.  Everything was delicious, presentation was very cute, and the portion sizes were perfect.  Quite affordable, the prices weren't outrageous, and the service was incredibly welcoming and friendly.     I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty interesting decor inside this place -- they really went all-out with it.  It's pretty nifty to see the wall of plants near the entrance and the kitchen is really unique.  Before ordering, the waiter indicated that they are cash-only, so it was good to let us know before it was too late.  They have a lot of things on their menu -- my friends and I came here for a break from Doors Open two weekends ago, so it was our first time there.  I ordered the Uji Matcha Smoothie and my friends got their iced teas -- we didn't order any snacks but from what we'd seen from neighbouring tables, their waffles are something to try for another visit.  The smoothie could've had more matcha flavour, but it was still pretty good.  Things are a bit on the pricier side but the interior is really nice so it's pretty comfy dining-in.  I'm interested in coming back to see what their food is like, so hopefully I can update this review soon."}
{"text":"Really nice place. The food and desserts are original and taste great.  The decoration is pretty cool too especially the green wall at the entrance.  The service is good and fast. The only thing is the price. I find it overpriced but it still a really nice experience to go once in a while."}
{"text":"A nice interior with light wood theme (love the green leaves wall at the front but we were seated at the very back). Maybe better for drinks/snack as my lunch meal was not filling (I guess hence the name 'light [meal] cafe')  I had the Lobster Bisque soup combo - comes with 4 thin slices of garlic toast (good) and small bowl of salad. The soup was surprisingly not bad - hot enough, and not too heavy/salty as most lobster bisques are.  Comments on friends' dishes: Truffle Mushroom Croissant lacked truffle flavour; the smoked salmon-topped baked potato looked nice but was small portion and messy to eat; Black sesame waffle was dry and hard."}
{"text":"Try the Light Cafe special! Super cute and it makes around 2 cups of coffee! Comes with 2 biscuits. Their rose tea and coffee tasted a bit over roasted/over steeped, but I would honestly come here just for the ambiance alone...I just love their decor! I wouldn't recommend this cafe for their teas and coffee alone though.    Nom factor - 3.8/5 (coffee is a bit over-roasted) Service - 4 Price - $4.50"}
{"text":"Everything is so beautiful. Large menu and filling meals. They definitely present their dishes through your eyes first. If you weren't a food photographer to begin with, this is the place to get you started! The only downside I have here is ONLY accepts cash."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. The most recent time was on the weekend about 30 min after it opened for a table of 4.  While the food is decent, sandwiches are pretty good portions, the service was mediocre. From ordering to having the food ready, it must have been 35-40 min. Not only that, they brought everything piecemeal, so you couldn't even really eat together. Everything came separately with prob 5-10 min interspersed between.  Perhaps it was an off day but it left a bad experience and prob won't be back."}
{"text":"Great aesthetics, homely, and delicious! The foods on the menu weren't too expensive and were pretty affordable. I came here for lunch and had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated, but the worker decided to ask for our number so he could call us. Due to this, we were able to wander around the neighbourhood instead of standing in the store for that entire time.   The interior was beautiful, the lighting was very nice, but a bit dim towards the back of the store. It was also very modern. I decided to order the Ultimate BLT. When it came out, it was very well-presented. It was very unique as they made the sandwich using croissants instead of normal bread. It also came with a small bowl of salad and a small bowl of assorted fruit slices. However, when I took my first bite, the flakes from the croissant spilled all over the plate and table. It was very messy to eat, which made me feel a bit self-conscious while eating and the bacon was very oily.   Overall, the sandwich tasted very good and was very filling. I got sesame dressing on my salad which tasted very odd and the fruits tasted very fresh. There are two washrooms and an ATM machine at the back if you happen to not have any cash on you. There is also free wifi, which should be a huge bonus. The desserts looked very promising and I will definitely come back sometime in the future to try some out, along with the drinks! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat good food and take aesthetically pleasing photos!"}
{"text":"If I can put zero star I probably would. Waited 40 min for a chicken sandwiches with side salad. Side salad are those that you pour out from a grocery store bought salad mix. Chicken sandwiches has tiny pieces of chicken  meat that are attached to the soft bone. Pretty much you are chewing on soft bone, if you are eating it at all. Waited 50 min for a baked potato. Not bad actually has an egg and some pieces of bacon on it, only costs you 10 bucks. Didn't have time to try the dresser nor the coffee, cuz we waited one solid hour from sitting down to when our food arrived."}
{"text":"Flavourful. Fast. Good proportions at reasonable prices.   Went here for lunch and ordered the grilled chicken teriyaki mini pizza. It was basically a square pita bread topped with tomato sauce, sliced tomatoes, some chicken slices, teriyaki sauce, and some mozzarella. At first bite, it was splendid. A burst of flavours but nearing the end, I found it to be just too  much flavour. A little bit sickening tbh.  The mini pizza came with a salad with a salad dressing of your choice and a small ramekin of fruit salad: pieces of apples, oranges and pineapples. The fruit salad was nice but it was at room temperature and I don't like my fruits warm!   The salad was spring mix and I chose the yuzu salad dressing (yuzu is japanese for lemons). Pretty good at first bite but again, got tired of the flavour.   The place had great staff (although I did have to ask for more water rather than have them tend to it). Free wifi, good music. I would definitely come back to check out the dessert and drinks menu."}
{"text":"The location is beautiful with a whole wall of plants and nice lighting, white walls and white furniture. The menu has a lot of different items, from pastas, to sandwiches, to a variety of exciting desserts and elegant-sounding teas. I had the Truffle Mushroom Risotto and it was pretty yummy, but this was my first time trying risotto so I have nothing to compare it to. I initially wanted one of the smoked salmon items, but was disappointed to find out that the restaurant had \"run out of smoked salmon\". It was around 4ish o clock when they told me this, so they ran out pretty early. But, the servers are friendly. One thing I want to note is that their cups are so small lol. We kept calling our server back every 5-10min for water refills. She kept a smile on her face the whole time though. I'll be back to try out the desserts."}
{"text":"We had mango ice cream waffle and some drinks, it was pretty good. Definitely recommend it. All the drinks were presented very tastefully."}
{"text":"Just okay food. Wouldn't give me receipt that included my tip amount, and only accepts cash, for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Light Cafe... I call it IG Cafe. It's super aesthetic. They have a plant wall, white stone, dark wood, bright lights and a floor to ceiling glass front.  Completely on trend. Their menu items are impeccable arranged and ready for cameras if your shutter-fingers aren't fulfilled by all the surroundings already.   That being said, it's meh. I came here a few times since it's opened, usually to bring people who haven't been here yet. The service is alright, nothing extraordinary. The food and drinks, meh for the price you're paying. I've gotten a regular latte, the infamous cotton candy coffee, and fruit infused teas... they don't taste like anything you can't get from Starbucks and they cost $2 more for less quantity.  For food I've had the smoked duck breast salad (which I actually like and have gotten 3 times but damn it's pricey) and I've had their also infamous black waffles... which tasted like normal waffles.. but black.  Overall, you come here and you pay for the ambience and the presentation.  It think it's great for a casual business lunch or maybe a first date. It's casual enough because it's a cafe but nice enough to take someone of importance."}
{"text":"Cool decor. Desserts are good. Service is pleasant. Overall a nice experience at this Taiwanese-style cafe.  Tried the black sesame waffles and oreo smoothie. Both are quite unique and interesting. The waffles are not too sweet with a nice hint of the black sesame flavour. The oreo smoothie was a bit bland initially but after it started melting, allowing me to stir everything together, it started to be much better. I'm curious about their bakery-style hot dishes; wouldn't mind coming back in to try those if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of...don't judge a restaurant by it's glass front.  Light Cafe is an Instagrammer's dream, serving food that's so pretty, you'd be begging your friends to wait while you let your camera do the eating. But beyond that point, Light Cafe falls short of it's delivery.   Light Cafe is situated in Baldwin street, and it's instantly recognizable. In the restaraunt, and open concept kitchen allows you to glimpse into the creatively decorated restaurant, comes with it's own vertical garden, and cute decor. My friends and I are swayed to try out this restaurant for a long time, so we ordered several menu items ranging from savioury to sweet. The dishes came out beautifully, but lacked in overall flavours. Savioury items such as the Lobster sandwich had too much mayo, and not enough seasoning, while sweet items such as the waffles lacked any particular depth, other than the taste of the ice cream.   So whilst Light Cafe is beautiful on the outside, suffice to say our camera has eaten enough, as we won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of my friends is the best of the best to finding new places for us to eat at so when she said she had a new cafe for us to try, I was more than ecstatic! It lived up to my standards too, considering I took a couple of my other friends back.  Although I recommend getting reservations first, the wait when you show up unexpectedly isn't that long. When we showed up out of the blue, we were told to leave a number so that we free to roam the streets until a table cleared up for us. Reservations shed off the most, ten minutes of your time since we had walked down the street and back before we got a phone call, telling us our table was ready.  It's a small cafe fit for small groups rather than large parties. Quiet and calm, so some of the customers there were there to study or catching up with friends. All in all, the environment was warm and looked beautiful! Perfect for those of you who want to sneak in some photos for Instagram, hehe.   Speaking of Instagram, the food was great! Their menu carries a variety of dishes from sandwiches to pizzas to desserts! The first time I went I got a Philly Steak croissant with a strawberry milkshake. If you're getting a sandwich, prepare for it to get a bit messy on your plate bc they're stuffed! A crispy croissant topped with steak and warm cheddar cheese with a small salad as a side. The milkshake was huge, but the sweet familiar goodness and perfect for a hot day in the summer! Definitely filled me and was perfect for a brunch meal. The second time I went I got strawberries waffles with an iced lemon tea - again, the perfect meal for the summer day and who doesn't love dessert? The waffles were soft and all the components on the plate were perfectly incorporated (the syrup + strawberries + ice cream = yum!). An iced tea is always a safe bet but The Light Cafe served a refreshing tea that I downed in minutes.   The cafe also has some desserts on display for you to take home, such as cakes and macaroons. The only problem is that they only accept cash but there's an ATM there so this shouldn't have that big of a problem. In the end, The Light Cafe is the perfect place to go for any occasion with a small group of friends or even by yourself. It's my new favourite cafe and I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe on Baldwin St.   I ordered the grilled wasabi chicken sandwich and it came with house sides (beets and another kind of veggie) and salad (they have four kind of salad dressings).  Since it was wasabi mayo sauce for the chicken sandwich and I'm not a fan of mayo I got the sauce on the side.  The meal tasted alright, nothing special.  It was just presented nice.   I also tried the matcha red bean waffle with .  The waffle was a bit hard.  Nonetheless the ice cream and red bean was delicious.  It also came with matcha syrup which I poured over the waffle and made it taste a tad better."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this cafe out for awhile.   Visited Light Cafe on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very busy, only a couple of tables were occupied. We were given menus and water once seated. After looking at the menu, we decided on the Light Cafe Special, Hazelnut Latte and Matcha & Red Bean waffle to share.   Visually, when we got our order it was attractive. The waffle was A-OK but nothing impressive, I don't think I would get this again however it was pretty for an Instagram photo. The latte was delicious and not overly sweet, just the way I like it. The Light Cafe Special, my boyfriend said it wasn't anything special - I also tried it and wasn't overly impressed although visually it was quite pretty to look at.   I didn't get a chance to try the food here aside from the waffle but I'd be willing to give it another try to see if as delicious as it sounds. Overall, I would recommend others to give this place a try as the atmosphere was very calming and decor was quite simple but spacious. Kitchen is open concept which makes the place look a lot bigger and overall service was good as well. But, don't forget to bring cash - this cafe accepts cash only (ATM in the back if you don't have cash but highly recommend you bring cash!) I hope eventually you'll accept at least debit, it'll make it a lot easier since I don't normally carry cash on a regular basis."}
{"text":"What a wonderful café! It's nestled along the same street as a lot of other famous locations (e.g. Kekou's ice cream) and it fits right in with the others! I will definitely come back to dine sometime!  The café itself is really roomy and beautifully decorated. They should really give their graphic and interior designers a really large check because I have never seen designs so meticulously crafted. Light Café is minimalistic, sleek, and primarily features black and white colors. The TOILET is black. The SINK is black. Their waiters are dressed in black. (And, side note, their soap smells fantastic.)  We came at a rather odd time (not quite dinner, not quite lunch) but it was rather full at that point. We still got seated immediately, and we received these incredibly small cups of water to drink from. Our food arrived before our coffee did, but that's alright, because wow the food is delicious.  Everything is quite greasy, so I advise NOT to use your hands, but rather the cutlery they give to you. (I cut my mushroom croissant with a fork and knife.) I'm sure whatever food you get you'll be happy with it, but we got the Lobster Bisque (delicious, accompanied with crispy garlic bread) and the Truffle Mushroom Croissant (a big hit on yelp, for good reason!)  The coffee comes with a little handkerchief to pour your coffee into your cup in case it's too hot, and the cotton candy, while intriguing, is really just a sugar substitute. The drink itself isn't that good, however, so you should get it solely for photographic purposes."}
{"text":"Let me sum up my dessert tasting at Light Cafe: Prompt service, courteous staffs, tasty and creative French inspired desserts, hippish/trendy vibe in a chic/modern cosy environment.   Pretty much a quaint little sweet spot in downtown to catch up with friends and indulge in some desserts. The only downside is probably the only method of payment- cash.... so come with an empty stomachs and a wallet full of dough !   Definitely a re-visit is in the plans..."}
{"text":"The place has stunning decor for a café! The ambience was great and the service from the waiters/waitresses was amazing as well. I ordered the chicken salad and it was very tasty. My favorite part about it was the sesame dressing that had smoky flavors. I wasn't too fond of the chicken as it gave off a slight smell but i'm picky about that in general. The creme brûlée latte was very tasty as well but i believe the waiter brought it a bit late because it wasn't warm. Overall i recommend for a visit!"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable!!!!!! The decor is every instagrammers' dream - marble, greenery, cute lights and perfectly plated dishes and drinks. I must say the place is super popular so you may need to wait for seats. The menu is quite extensive with various drinks (slushes, lattes, au laits, fruit teas, coffee, etc ), desserts (waffles, crepes, mille feuille, cakes, etc) and also savoury items such as sandwiches, salads and soup. The servers were all super nice and helpful with recommendations. We ordered the tiramisu latte, matcha au lait and the strawberry waffle. Everything was nicely presented and added to the experience. I appreciate the fact that they have put in a lot of effort over everything that they serve. The strawberry waffle had a generous amount of strawberries and ice cream. The kitchen is open concept so you can peer in to see what everyone is up to! Overall, we will be back to this cute cafe and looking forward to trying the savoury items next time for lunch."}
{"text":"So a friend of mine took me here. It's a Taiwanese inspired café. The atmosphere and the presentation of their items are beautiful and contemporary. The coffee itself is just average. I ordered the cotton candy coffee. They coffee in one bottle and milk in another. There's an empty cup and a ball of cotton candy. The point is to place the cotton candy in the cup and then pour the coffee over it to dissolve it. It's a fun way to have a nice cup of coffee.   If you order the light cafe special it's simply coffee and milk in giant glass tubes. We also ordered the tiramisu latte and red bean Au lait. Red bean Au lait was actually better tasting than the coffee and lattes though presentation was simpler.   Great for groups, studyin (they have wifi). Unfortunately it's cash only."}
{"text":"Really interesting place given the location.  It reminds me of those fancy bubble tea places (the classy ones uptown, and not the grungy cramped ones downtown).  It is quite girly and would be a nice place to take a date, if your date were Asian (this is exactly what a friend of mine said).  Our service was good.  We ordered drinks and sandwiches, which came with a side of salad and fruits.  The food is very girly type foods that are excellent for picking at, say, on a date.  It was such a beautiful day when we came and it was a shame that Light Cafe did not have a patio.  It was rather hot inside because the AC was not running properly.    Oh, okay I forgot that they only accept cash.  They have one sketchy looking ATM at the back, which didn't work when I tried to take money out.  I maybe would have had to do dishes if my friend wasn't there to pay, in which case it was convenient that they had an open position."}
{"text":"A cute little Asian fusion French-style cafe with beautiful decor (the lights and wall of greenery makes me really happy!). My group came after a particularly expensive meal looking for something sweet to round the evening off.  We ordered some waffles, some creme brulee, and one of the mille feuille with mango. Beautifully plated sweets arrived and we all shared. I've always had a thing for sweets in mason jars and the creme brulee was great (Earl Grey had the most of my attention). The flaky mille feuille, the custard, and the mango also was a pleasing bite. I couldn't recall much about the waffles but it could be that I had reached critical mass and no longer could fully appreciate what I was eating.   I hope to come back to have a proper meal (some of the sandwiches and entrees look and sound really delicious!)."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful! Everything is light and airy and there's even a live plant wall (the watering system came on part way through our visit). We came here for dessert after a meal in the area and it definitely satisfied our sweet craving. We decided to try the sesame waffles and choco-banana mille-feuille. Our server suggested we add mochi to our waffle, and I'm really glad she did. The mochi is added to center of the waffle and adds a nice chewiness in contrast to the crisp exterior. The waffle itself didn't have too much flavour, however it comes with a little pot of sesame sauce and some sesame and vanilla ice cream to add creaminess and flavour. It was fun to fill all the waffle crevasses with the sauce. Entertainment and deliciousness! The mille-feuille was good, but not great. The puff pastry was crisp, but the chocolate cream filling didn't have enough flavour. There was a little syringe of chocolate sauce, but I would have liked a whole pot full to add more chocolate flavour. I did like that they torched the banana to add and extra dimension to the whole dessert. The savoury menus looked impressive, so I'd like to come back to try that out."}
{"text":"Staffs are friendly and  super helpful! It is a great place to spent some quality time with your friends. I truly enjoy the environment there and also the yummy desserts and savouries. I have been to to this place twice and so far I had nothing bad but great experiences.   My favourite is the Earl Grey waffle. Yep. You didn't misread it! They offer waffle in Earl Grey flavour. It is infused with right amount of earl grey tea flavouring in both the waffle and the maple syrup. I think this is a must try item for those who loves to drink earl grey tea.  Besides, the ice creams (vanilla and chocolate) that come with the waffle also tastes amazing. My friend and i love the vanilla one the most. It has some crushed pistachios on top and we poured some maple syrup on top of it. God! It is just perfect!   My friend ordered the creme burlee set. It comes with 3 different flavours. (Red bean, Caramel Custard and Coffee) The red bean is the lightest out of the three and then coffee as the 2nd, Caramel custard as the 3rd. They all look cute and most importantly tasted good.  We paid around $25 including tips for both dishes. p.s. I asked them a question for my friends who need to eat Halal meal and hopefully it helps others who shares the same preference. This store used vanilla powder for all their waffles batter rather than vanilla extract. So there is no worries as it does not contain any alcohol sustains in it. You can also swap the vanilla ice cream into another flavour without extra charged. But no luck for their creme burlee set though."}
{"text":"A cute little cafe perfect for a date or get togethers with friends! I've been here twice and would definitely keep coming back and recommend to others to come for lunch or dessert.   Both times I've been here I did not make a reservation and had to wait about 30-45 minutes each time. This was not an issue as the street it is on (Baldwin Street) had a few neat stores to check out, as well as a huge BBT place to wait at next door (Charidise)  The strawberry Waffle was good. Not amazing by any means but it was still tasty. The Earl Grey Waffle was a huge disappointment for me though. I felt Iike the waffle was a bit dry and the ice cream was not Earl Grey flavoured enough.   The food here was much better than the dessert! I loved the lobster bisque soup. There was no actual pieces of lobster in it, but it was still delicious?! The smoked duck breast salad was also really yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a friend for dessert. We ordered the earl grey waffle and added a sesame ice cream on the side to share. I loved the texture of the waffles, it was soft and chewy. There was the perfect hint of earl grey flavour infused in the waffles. The vanilla ice cream was very milky, just the way I like it. Service was friendly as well. I would definitely come back for another waffle."}
{"text":"By far my FAVORITE cafe. I've been here 3 times. They serve my top 3 things and they taste absolutely scrumptious:  1. Teas - love love love their fruit teas!!! Tried the Taiwanese fruit tea... Kind of too concentrated but once I got some extra hot water it was perfect. The chamomile fruit tea was amazing as well... I would definitely order these again. 2. Truffle croissant -     jus to die for. Had this the other time and how could I resist ordering this again. I'm jus speechless of the flavor combination. The salad dressing that they have for the salad is also really good. 3. Desserts... I cannot resist!!! Black seseme seed waffle with ice cream - heart shaped waffles... Made cute... Black seseme and vanilla ice cream with black seseme sauce... Amazing combo.  The service is great, so if ur in the area... You must must must come visit this place whether it's for coffee, tea, lunch, dinner or dessert!!! Give it a try... U won't regret it"}
{"text":"Love the Earl Grey rose latte and the grapefruit soda!! MUST try the choco-banana mille feuille so nice and light with the caramelized banana!! Perfect dessert after the meal!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with my sister. We came here for the charcoal black sesame waffle and the creme brûlée. The creme brûlée was sold out so we just ended up having just the waffle.   The black sesame charcoal waffle was extremely bad. One of the worst waffles I've had. The exterior is not crispy and the interior of the waffle is not soft and moist. The waffle was dry and chewy. It was so dry that the waffle was wrinkly...it tasted really stale. It didn't seem like it was freshly made as it wasn't hot or even warm.. such a disappointment.   Though the sesame sauce and sesame and vanilla ice cream were decent. They need to work on those waffles.   As for service, it was not that good either. The waiter was not that friendly or attentive.    Overall, probably would not come back again.    P.S. this place is cash only. ATM at the back."}
{"text":"This place probably wins for most instagrammable cafe in Toronto. We ordered a strawberry waffle, fruit chamomile tea, and the earl grey rose latte. Overall I had a pretty good experience, the food looks better than it tastes."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the overall design and aesthetics of this cafe. I've been here several times and most meals I've ordered were good. They also put an effort in the food presentation which I love. However, i do agree that their menu is on the pricer side, especially when you compare it with the portion size. I'd love to come here more often if it wasn't as pricey."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place for insta lovers or food bloggers and if ur Feeling boujee a regular coffee will be great too!  the place is ACTUALLY lit. There is something for everyone. U have pizza with a salad on the side or waffles with a scoop of choclate ice cream on the top. This place has amazing teas!!! The vanilla and milk tea are the best. The items are priced a bit high but totally worth it. They also have cheesecake which tastes heavenly. Overall, if ur going a casual date with a friend or an actual date at 4 or 5 pm then this is the perfect place"}
{"text":"Nice place to chat with friends. The menu is really well designed. The food there is like home-made, especially croissant sandwiches. We ordered a mochi-waffle. This is not my first time to have such stuff, however, it is not well mixed before bake and somehow too hard. The baked potato is too soft and watery. The favourite part is the yuzu dressing on the smoke duck breast salad. Besides, we are satisfied with coffees and drinks."}
{"text":"Light Cafe was AMAZING!! Upon entering you are greeted by friendly waitstaff and the great aroma of waffles. There wasn't a table ready for when I arrived but the hostess took down my name and phone number and told me there would be about a 5-10 minute wait. 5 minutes later I got a call saying my table was ready - that was fast! I was already impressed with their turnaround time.   Upon being seated you are given menus on the aesthetic marble tables which are picture perfect. The friendly waitress gave us water and menus and some suggestions as we placed our order which was a nice touch. They really know the menu well and made sure to ask the chef of any clarifications. We decided on some lattes, coffee, 'cream' brûlée and strawberry waffle.   I read on Yelp the food takes some time to be prepared so I was expecting some wait time. The lattes and coffee were delivered first, quite swiftly, in very unique cups. With barely any wait time, the fresh strawberry waffle came, complete with a little strawberry syrup container.   The waffle was so fresh and great portion size! You can easily split this between 2 or 3 people. The strawberry icecream was great too! So fresh and not overly sweet.   As I began to eat my portion of the waffle, the cream brûlée came. This was creme brûlée 3 ways, white chocolate, early grey and coffee. It had a perfectly crisp sugar top, and the flavour palette was awesome. The early grey was my favourite flavour and had a small dollop of vanilla ice cream on top. Too adorable.   The ambience was great complete with a 'living' wall, aesthetically pleasing decor, and relatively quite atmosphere. The desserts were equally amazing, and the awesome customer service definitely made this experience worthwhile. I look forward to returning to Light Cafe. They did an excellent job!"}
{"text":"I visited this cafe twice and absolutely loved it! It's a friendly environment and the food is really good. Their desserts are also super creative and delicious, especially their waffles!"}
{"text":"An instagram dream. It's white and bright inside especially near the windows. There's ample seating but still crowded during peak hours. Key is getting the seating with the green background so cute!   I feel like people come for the black waffles and the cotton candy coffee. So of course i ordered those too. I got the mochi in my waffles and i dont think it added to it positively i would hold off on the mochi. Everything tastes decent but let's be honest it's for the photo. I wouldn't go out of my way to go again because it's pricey and you're paying for the aesthetics.   The service was very nice and it's a full sit down service although you go up to the cashier to pay at the end. It makes sense because it's basically a restaurant rather than a cafe."}
{"text":"This is a lovely and stylish cafe. They've got a lot of food and beverage items, some that you'd never even think exist. Like cotton candy coffee, they serve you with a stick of cotton candy, brewed coffee, and milk. Although it really just tasted like regular brewed coffee. For the cotton candy coffee we waited about 45 minutes which was just ridiculous. They need more wait staff as there was only one or two people serving the entire place"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Lobster roll ($14.75) A good amount of lobster chunks in the roll. The lobster rolls were tasty, flavorful but not drenched in mayonnaise like what most places do. The bread roll that it comes in was toasted just right, not greasy or oily. Comes with a side of salad and as well as a small bowl of fruit salad too. I didn't really like the salad dressing but the fruit salad was refreshing.  Truffle mushroom croissant ($10.25) The croissant was reheated in the oven, crunchy but not flakey like it was freshly baked. The croissant sandwich was tasty though, love the mushrooms and the truffle sauce was really good. Messy to eat though. Comes with a small side of salad and as well as a fruit salad too. The salads were refreshing.  Cotton candy coffee ($4.95) This was cute and interesting, but more of a gimmick. You place the cotton candy in the mug and pour the hot coffee in to melt the cotton candy, and the cotton candy essentially acts as the sugar to the coffee. I like how it come with a bottle of hot milk to add to your coffee or you can drink it on the side as well. In terms of coffee brew, nothing special to me.  Also had the lobster bisque to start. I was expecting chunks of lobster instead of crunched bits. Tasted nothing special, I've had better.  Overall love the food presentation but the food alone was average, nothing special and slightly expensive for what it is. I do love the decor of the restaurant - nice and bright and nice furniture."}
{"text":"Really good coffees (Viennese and the Light cafe special) and waffles (strawberry) !!   Decor and vibe is really nice and relaxed, good place to work or meet up with friends"}
{"text":"The reason why I gave it 3 stars because, the waitress gave us unclean water, there were food straps or something in both of our cups. Which who knew what was inside. Service was okay, took a while for the food to arrive though."}
{"text":"Light Cafe is a very clean & modern cafe that serves delicious & pretty food. It's great for taking pictures and eating lunch, but isn't the best cafe for  reading or studying. It was very busy when I went, even at 2:30 in the afternoon.   The servers recommendation, the truffle mushroom croissant, was delicious. The flavours and ingredients were fantastic, and it came with some fresh fruit and a nutty salad (which was also delicious, usually complimentary salads don't taste this good). The service was also extremely fast; I barely sat down and the servers already handed us waters. My main issue with light cafe, along with the busyness, is that the food isn't very filling. Other than that I highly recommend it! I'll probably be back to try the desserts - from what I saw they look amazing"}
{"text":"Went here to order a drink for takeout and got to sit at a table while I waited. I ordered the (iced) uji matcha latte and I was surprised to see espresso in it because usually matcha lattes just come with matcha unless specified. That threw me off a bit haha and the drink was alright, it just tasted weird with the coffee and that the matcha was not well mixed as I saw clumps at the bottom. Overall, it's a nice place with pretty interior designing and I'd come back if I was feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"I agree with some other reviews - they're a bit understaffed. There was only one server when we came and we were constantly waiting on something - especially the water which is served in these tiny glasses.  I got the Montreal Smoked Beef Croissant and it was good and super flakey, but not really worth the $13. I think I'll come back for some coffee next time which seems to be their specialty.  CASH ONLY - don't have cash? The ATM in the convenient store across the street charges $1.50 rather than the $3.00 ATM in the cafe."}
{"text":"I had the truffle mushroom croissant and it was so delicious. Cash only place! They have an atm but it didn't work on my American credit cards so I had to find another atm. I went on a Wednesday evening and it was only have full with some people on their laptops as if it were a coffee shop."}
{"text":"A simple cafe with a taiwanese flair. I found the food to be average. I think the big sell at this restaurant are their drinksA few people were ordering their cotton candy coffee and the presentation looked great.   This seems to be a hit with students as I saw many studying there.   If I recall correctly, it is cash only."}
{"text":"I had light house special coffee and it was so great! They have tubes and I just mixed coffee w milk together. Haha like we're doing bench work in the lab Lol"}
{"text":"My experience here was decent. The environment was very nice and well decorated. I came here with friend to talk and catch up. We were comfortably seated and were not rushed.  They had a large selection of cakes and desserts. The cheesecake my friend got looked amazing and she said it was quite delicious. I got the cotton candy coffee. The coffee was poured over the cotton candy, which melted the cotton candy. The cotton candy was supposed to act as the sweetener. It was a bit pricy for a coffee for $5-$7 from what i remember. It was just black coffee, some milk on the side, and plain cotton candy. It was very pretty, but the coffee was lukewarm. By the time you put the milk in the drink, it was cold. Not really an optimal temperature to enjoy your drink."}
{"text":"Saw a BlogTO feature on this cafe, so decided to stop by for lunch.  The cafe's decor is very cute, with a wall of greenery on one side and an open concept bar/kitchen in the middle.   I ordered the Cotton Candy Coffee, which is a deconstructed coffee with a big puffy ball of white cotton candy that acts as the sweetener. The coffee was good, and it was fun to watch the cotton candy melt as you poured in the coffee and warm milk.  I had the Lobster Roll as the main, which came with a side salad. There were essentially 2 sandwiches, and each was like a piece of toast folded in half with the lobster filling. The filling was just ok - personally would have preferred the mayo to be more buttery/lobster-y.   Service was good overall but for some reason they didn't take anything except cash, so make sure you have some on you if you come!"}
{"text":"Wasnt expecting much, only came cause the food looked pretty But was surprised by grilled wasabi chicken sandwich and the ham croissant! They were great. Was disappointed by the texture of the oreo smoothie though. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Light Cafe Canada is a cafe originating from Taiwan offering gourmet café food and drinks with a contemporary twist. I have been here on a few occasions, and have always liked the bright and open-concept space. The contemporary space itself is very Instagrammable with its bright background, clean white marble tables, and a backdrop of live plants sprouting from the walls. They do have several seats in the front (best lighting), and a bunch more tables in the back. It's a good place to dine for all sorts of occasions like casual lunch or dinner, date night, and catching up with friends.   Light Cafe pays very close attention to presentation, which I can truly appreciate. The Lobster Bisque ($9.25) was well presented on a wooden board - the soup was served in an individual sized saucepan alongside slices of garlic bread, and side salad. The lobster bisque was also available on its own for $6.25. The bisque has been tweaked to satiate the Asian palate, as it wasn't as salty or rich compared to French lobster bisque. but it remained fragrant.  My favorite menu item from Light Cafe has to be their  Lobster Roll ($15.50) - chopped lobster, crab meat & shrimp in a creamy dressing on two freshly baked soft roll. The overall composition of the lobster roll here was pretty good, as the meat to bun ratio was not disproportional. I really liked the buttery toasted bun. Overall, it was well-priced, tasty, and generously portioned.   Lastly, Light Cafe has a wide selection of desserts to satisfy one's sweet tooth. The desserts here aren't as sugar-averse as the typical Western desserts. Looking through the menu, I saw that they recently introduced waffles to their desserts menu including seasonal fruits, strawberry, early grey, and charcoal black sesame waffle. We ended up getting the Strawberry Waffle ($9.95), which arrived with ice-cream, whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries, and topped off with strawberry sauce. This was quite a decadent dessert, and the waffle texture was nice and soft.  Overall, I had an enjoyable meal at Light Cafe, and do recommend the restaurant when one is looking for an affordable casual dining space. For the price point, it was a rather exemplary dining experience. I also liked that the management was open to criticism and feedback, and they do listen to what customers want/need."}
{"text":"The aesthetic is on point in this place. Very bright with a nice wall of plants, perfect for pictures on Instagram. Our server was very pleasant and the food came around 20 minutes after we ordered.   If you're here primarily for the food, it's not worth it. It's overpriced and doesn't fill you up but the presentation was beautiful. I got the Philly steak croissant and there was way too much cheese which made it difficult and messy to eat.   I didn't get dessert but I would come back to try it."}
{"text":"I came here with niece since I've been seeing this place all over my IG feed.  So if you want a really nice looking IG post for your feed then this place is really good for that.  Food wise it's not the greatest and for me it's a little over priced.  I had the truffle mushroom croissant sandwich.  Although it may look big it's actually. It that filling.  You have to realize the croissants are light when you eat it so it's gna leave you hungry for sure.  This is one of the places I would just go once."}
{"text":"It surprised me to see the low ratings here because I actually thought this cafe was a hidden gem! It's easily accessible, service is both friendly and fast, food is tasty (a little overpriced but that's okay), and tea was tasty and they refilled water with no complaints!!   The decor is every Instagram bloggers dream- with white stone finished tables to wall covered with living plants, this place has a super cool vibe that's definitely friendly for dates or friends hang out!  Only thing is that it's cash only but they have an ATM right in store so it's not a huge problem."}
{"text":"What really drew me to this restaurant wasn't the food but more so the atmosphere. Really liked the atmosphere here. They had a wall full of green plants as the backdrop and it was very refreshing to walk into a clean cute cafe with a very big kitchen. I came here to try their house coffee and it wasn't bad! I would come back to try the black sesame waffles with the black sesame ice cream though.   Last tip?   It's interesting to just sit and watch people come in and out of the cafe. I was sitting there sipping my coffee when I saw a family come in and sat down. Mom goes in to the bathroom first and then it wasn't long before the mom came out, the family sits for two minutes before the family walks out! And it happened at the same table not once, but twice since I sat down. The same scenario!! I guess their cafe has a really nice washroom?"}
{"text":"Ordered the Charcoal waffle here. This was probably the worst waffle i've ever tried. It took around 20 minutes or more for the order of waffle to even come even though there was only 3 other tables in the restaraunt. When the waffles arrived. The waffles weren't even hot. It tasted old and dry. It seemed like they got them out of a bag. It was really difficult cutting the waffles as it was really tough. The sesame sauce and ice cream was pretty good but it literally defeated the purpose of the waffles and ice cream because the waffles were uneatable  Service was pretty poor, the lady never really came around to serve us besides serving the waffles and taking our order. The bill literally took forever also. Overall, the servers weren't really attentive."}
{"text":"Are you Asian? Well even if you aren't, and you're just \"Asian\", you'd feel right at home here. This place smells SO GOOD. it smells like a fresh creme bakery, instantly making me feel better. The atmosphere is like a trendy diner with a Japanese - American inspired menu. The focus is on breakfast foods, salads, sandwiches, and sweets. There's no sausages, bacon or eggs here. Instead, you get awesome waffles, sandwiches, and salads. Finish it off with a wonderful cheesecake or coffee and youll feel like a Japanese waifu by the time you leave here. Also, it's CASH ONLY, so come prepared.   The dishes here are arranged so beautifully that you're bound to get tons of Instagram likes, so bring that camera!  Average cost for a meal here = 15-18$"}
{"text":"Although we came around 10 mins before the kitchen closes (around 11:30) our waitress gave us enough time to put our order in and recommended to try their cotton candy coffee (deconstructed coffee you can pour according to your taste) their light caffe special is the same as their cotton candy coffee except they give you sugar cubes instead of the cotton candy (and at a cheaper price too)  Their waffles are delicious made with fresh fruit, beautifully presented and can be pulled apart into bite sized portions(great for sharing). The black sesame waffle is a classic choice if you're not that into sweet desserts but the mango waffle was on point. Their creme brûlée sampler is also great if you don't want a huge dessert.  If you're in town this place is a must try, definitely willing to come back here again next time I stop by Toronto"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their sandwiches are delicious especially the truffle mushroom croissant. The salads are also divine. A little pricey (2-3$) more than I would expect but still would come back as it is quite tasty"}
{"text":"It's picture perfect. And that's all. It's a very cute place with very Instagram friendly food but it was a huge disappointment.  I was so excited to try this place out, I went with my girlfriends and we ordered almost everything on their dessert menu. But none of us liked the food. The presentation is amazing but the taste is at best Blahh .  I'm happy that I tried it and took pretty pictures but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Back for another lunch! Already, I know. :P  Another friend & coworker had heard about the cafe and was eager to try.  This time, she ordered the smoked duck salad. This salad looked a bit different than the one I had last week - with the addition of cauliflower. She also chose the yuzu dressing and liked it!  As for me, I went straight for the pricier dish (which I eyed on my first visit), and got the lobster roll. It on toasted sliced white bread - you get 2 of them, with a side salad and fruit cup. It was good! Definitely recommend it.  Service was still slow, as mentioned in my original review BUT I saw them training 4-5 new staffers this time - so speed of service should be increasing soon!"}
{"text":"Came by for dessert and afternoon tea with a few friends during a busy weekend. We were told there was a 2 hr seating limit during peak busy times.   I ordered a single origin blend slow drip coffee and my friends and I shared a matcha red bean mini mille-feuille and cream brulee three ways (early grey, matcha, coffee flavours). We were all surprised at the small size of the mille-feuille as we did not realize it was a mini one at first. We didn't understand why the restaurant decided to have a regular size and a mini size mille-feuille when some flavour combinations were only available in the regular size and some were only available in the mini size. This in itself was very confusing as it makes more sense to have one consistent size of mille-feuilles. The creme brulees were good though.  Service was good but the drinks took a while to be made and as a result we got our desserts before our drinks. It was to the point where we almost finished our food before our drinks came.   Would be interested to try the savory foods but I imagine the place gets busy during lunch hours!"}
{"text":"A very cozy nice place to drop by and have some food. They have a wide categories of dishes, including salads, sandwiches, pastas and pastries desserts, and also many choices of beverages. The truffle mushroom croissant was normally yummy and the corn soup was great. The mille feuille was very crispy."}
