{"text":"Update to my previous review.  I was contacted directly by the manager and they wanted to rectify my previous experience.  They invited us to be their guests next time we were in the restaurant and they made the experience excellent.  This is the mark of an extraordinary establishment.  Understanding that their business is make customers happy and making sure they come back.   Still the best steak in town and my favorite place in the city."}
{"text":"Had the special, wagyu tomahawk steak, for dinner. And it was sublime. One of the best steaks I've ever had; seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly--it just melted in my mouth. Definitely an entree for two.  Experience: Fresh oysters to start Notable side: Corn creme brulee (an absolute must) Service: Excellent  Should have ordered the beignets for dessert but had no room!  Overall, 4 stars. The only con is that we were seated at a table with no direct lighting from the ceiling. Even with the candle, it was a bit hard to see. The table adjacent to us had ample lighting and through observation, it seemed that other tables were fine as well. It definitely dimmed the steak experience. The food was amazing. It would have been a 5 star experience had we gotten the chance to gawk at how beautiful the steak was."}
{"text":"Visiting from NY the name 44 got my attention I'm so glad it did. The bone-in filet buttered down medium rare served on a 500 degree plate was delicious. I complimented it with King crab and rock shrimp Mac & cheese which was superb."}
{"text":"Went here for a 30th Birthday dinner, group of 8 of us. Had a minor snafu with the reservation but it wasn't the restaurants fault and they made sure we were accommodated. The original reservation was for a table in the bar area but we ended up being seated in one of the back dining rooms, which worked out great anyway because it was a little quieter and our evening turned out great regardless. The staff was VERY attentive. Our server was fantastic. We started off with a seafood tower. Biggest shrimp I've ever seen. Pricey but well worth it. Ordered a petite filet for the entree which was cooked perfectly and delicious. Someone ordered a side of fries for the table and they were very over-seasoned so they took them back and didn't charge. All the other sides were yummy. One person in our group spilled red wine on himself and I swear a busser had an opened bottle of soda water on the table within 15 seconds! They even replaced the glass of wine. To end the evening the server brought out complimentary beignets and a couple other desserts! Everyone in our party was very impressed and had a great time."}
{"text":"We came in last night to celebrate my birthday and im so glad we did!!! This place is pricey but its well worth it. Ssrvice was excellent and every morsel of food from tgat kitchen was world class! Tganks steak44!"}
{"text":"Took some clients to dinner there last night and we had a great time. It was my first time there so I was very curious how Steak 44 would compare to other top end steakhouses in the valley. The restaurant is on the smaller side, but I found it intimate. I thought the service was excellent. The food was fantastic and the ambiance was fun and festive. I will definitely return for special occasions."}
{"text":"Wow. I didn't think anything could top Mastro's but this may have - and then I heard it was owned by the Mastro's family. The steak, sides, and service were all fantastic. I loved it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great staff, fantastic food and drinks. A memorable evening and one we hope to repeat soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to celebrate our 1st year anniversary with a nice dinner and I am so glad we chose Steak 44! First off, I love steak and I'm very picky about my steak being cooked correctly. I ordered the 12 oz New York Strip and it was prepared to perfection! Best steak I have ever had without question. The corn cream brule and brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious as well as the sautéed shrimp we had for an appetizer. Since it was our anniversary we received a free desert which was such a nice touch. We chose the Red Velvet Bread Pudding and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Our server, Jenna, was nice and personable, but over all the service was excellent with so many people coming to check on us. Needless to say, we had a wonderful experience. It was pretty expensive so not a place I would go all of the time, but we will definitely go back for any special occasion. Thanks Steak 44 for making our 1st year anniversary dinner so amazing!"}
{"text":"DELISH.   We both had filet mignons (I had the petite) and we had sides of corn creme brûlée and fries. The fries were not WOW but I don't know how you can with fries. The corn was delicious. It was the nice little sweetness to the dinner. The steak, I cannot say enough about. We both had truffle butter on our steak and I wouldn't have without it. That truffle butter and that sizzling steak was the best thing I have ever had. Better than Ruth Chris and better than City Hall but most comparable to city hall.  Definitely recommend this place. The server was very informative and very very nice."}
{"text":"Steak 44 was recommended by our hotel. It was outstanding. Great drinks, food and service. The restaurant called the next day  to inquire how we we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"The is the best steakhouse I have been to in awhile. The service is fantastic, Food unbelievable (even that great bread), and prices were great. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with the service I received tonight from Kyle at Steak 44. Daniel the manager tried to make amends but I still have a sour taste in my mouth.   Granted it was a large group with multiple checks. However, it was not the service I was expecting at this establishment. What a disappointing night to my girlfriends birthday celebration. Sorry Trina.   Food good. Wine awesome. Four glasses of Meiomi for my and my Fiancé.   Funny thing...Daniel (the manager?) came to table to apologize for the subpar service. Said he would adjust the bill for each patron. Then after about 10 minutes came back to the table with clanking glasses and a bottle of Prosecco saying it would be easier to give us some champagne (sorry when did Prosecco become champagne) than making any financial adjustments to our bills.   Laughable. I will not be back. At $100 per person."}
{"text":"Coming from California I was a bit skeptical about ordering seafood at a steakhouse in Arizona. Something about eating seafood in the middle of the desert just doesn't sound appetizing to me. However, the king crab legs were amazing. They were very fresh and the portion size was great. Highly Recommend I was a bit disappointed with the portion sizes for some of their side dishes. Their bread was ok and drinks were very strong. I was celebrating an anniversary with my girlfriend and we were given the opportunity to receive a complimentary dessert. We chose the butter cake since it was something familiar to us and we both had an indifferent opinion about it. Our server and busser were great and the whole staff was very friendly. I would highly recommend Steak 44 if you are looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner and ambience.  High energy atmosphere that makes you want to come back.  Steak w truffle butter is out of this world."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to come here for his birthday and boy am I happy we did!   Our waiter wasn't as attentive as I would have expected for this type of establishment but the rest of the wait staff did more than make up for it.   We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the ambiance the restaurant sets. What we had:  - 2 extra dirty martini  - Crispy Shrimp  - Bone in rib eye - The smashed - Onion Strings   The only downfall was a crying baby but that  isn't the restaurants fault and the manager was so apologetic about it.   Overall, I would come back. I plan on coming back. Please don't change because everything was amazing."}
{"text":"I have visited the restaurant several times and have always had excellent service and amazing food.  The sides are what seperates.this from most other steakhouses. Recomment onion shoestrings and we had the french fried asparagus. Also must try deep fried devil.eggs as a starter. Restaurant has many different areas.and rooms which makes it interesting. Also valet parking attendants makes for easy access."}
{"text":"This was one of the more interesting high-end steakhouses I've been to.  For starters, the ambiance is very energetic and loud - almost too loud.  I had a hard time hearing my girlfriend sitting across from me.  The dress code also seems to be, non-existent.  Saw a gentlemen in shorts, t-shirt, and flip flops with backwards hat being seated in the main dining room.  Nothing wrong with this, just a first for me at a steakhouse.  With that out of the way, the food was very reasonably priced and tasty.  We got a bottle of house red for under $40  (most places we've been have been $60 minimum).  I got the rib eye and the mac and cheese as a side.  Both were good, but I wouldn't go so far as great.  If you're looking for a place for a romantic date or a business meeting - this isn't it.  If you're looking for a good steakhouse to go with with your buddies after a round of golf or before you hit the clubs for the evening, this is your place."}
{"text":"The manager was very rude to my wife. It was uncalled for. I think he was prejudice and a racist. It was very offensive."}
{"text":"Patricia our server was amazing. She was very detailed oriented and had a smile during our dining experience. She heard we were here celebrating a promotion and brought a Smore desert to partake in the celebration. I will come here again because of her excellent service. Great place will be back soon."}
{"text":"Was a great special occasion dinner!  Service was very commendable, very attentive and our waitress explained the menu choices clearly, especially as one person in our party was vegetarian, so there were other options to choose from.  Nice décor, but also pretty noisy.  Sound levels were difficult to carry a conversation, should have asked to be seated in a quieter section, where the booths are.  There is also a separate dining room that was much quieter.   No private bottles of wine allowed, must use their wine list. Onto the food, which was very tasty!  Had the bone-in ribeye, deliciously seasoned in a blackened fashion.  The small cut was plenty big enough.  The house potatoes were very garlicky and cheesy, the sweet corn brulee, Brussel sprouts, mushrooms, all very tasty.  Would pass on the creamed spinach (5 Crowns and Gullivers in SoCal are better). Tossed house salad so-so, again Lawry's in L.A. does a better job. The meat is served on an extremely hot platter with the butter sizzling, very delectable.  In hindsight, should have ordered my meat a little more rare than their suggestion, as the meat is still cooking as it rest on the very hot platter.  It was still very tender and juicy though.  Desserts:  had the chocolate chip bread pudding, again very delicious and not overly sweet. Again, service was very good, they hand serve you all the sides onto your plate, and very prompt in refilling water goblets. All in all, a very good experience, well worth it."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Steak 44 with my family last night-there were five of us-and when we entered we noticed the hockey game was on TV. We asked to be seated within view of the game and we were well accommodated. This was a top-notch meal from the moment we entered the restaurant until the moment we pulled out of the parking lot. We had a variety of steaks, sides (lobster mac & cheese was amazing) and delicious warm rosemary rolls. The service was exactly what you'd expect from a top rated place and the food was even better. We were celebrating an engagement and a beautiful plate of dessert was brought out to the happy couple. I didn't think it was terribly pricey for what you get. I've paid more for lower quality. I would definitely return. The restaurant was recommended by my friend Kris who owns a restaurant in Illinois and knows the business. He was spot on. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Blaring Top 40 music from the speakers was a bit of a turnoff. Sorry but Katy Perry does not pair well with a $50 steak. Extra stars for the excellent service. The place was packed, and even still we were served quickly they paced the dishes perfectly."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an amazing experience at Steak 44 for the first time. Our server Mathieu was great and was exceptional. I've been to several of the high end steakhouses in the valley but think this was the best experience I've had.  Thank you to the team at Steak 44!"}
{"text":"Steaks were the best we have ever had....service was awesome.  You gotta go!"}
{"text":"Expensive but flawless. Best steak and oysters I've ever had. Great for a special occasion. :)"}
{"text":"very solid spot. our first visit here was about 3 years ago and we were stuffed into a back room for overflow since they had just opened and didn't know how to handle their popularity. we weren't impressed the first time around, but decided to give it a shot again this past weekend. they've got it down to a science now and everything was outstanding. the steak was like butter and so flavorful. the tempura asparagus were awesome, the truffle twice baked potato delectable, and the spicy shrimp appetizer amazing. my limeade was the perfect drink for me and the butter cake (i know they call it something else here, can't remember the name) was nothing less than perfect and one of my favorite desserts ever. we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We eat mostly vegetarian, but this place makes us want meat! We really enjoyed everything we ate here - filet mignon, bone-in filet, asparagus, mashed potatoes, salad, and our butter cake dessert. Service was really great as well!"}
{"text":"Divine!  Sean, Joe, Daniel and many others made this a tremendous pre-birthday evening for my husband.  Food was simply exceptional!  Champagne and Seafood, followed by fabulous steaks!  Dessert was outstanding!  Starting with the buttered  pound cake and beignet tree!!!  I am telling everyone!!  Thank you for such an exceptional evening!!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay, nothing special but not great. I got the king crab and NY Strip. The crab was a little fishy and not as sweet as a normally like. The NY was not a good cut that was in 3 separate pieces held together by some gristle in the middle of the steak. It was easy to cut around and overall was good, but not what I expected from a high end steak experience.  The atmosphere was awesome , trendy, excellent cocktails and service."}
{"text":"First time there, steak was ok, service is excellent, got a greeting going in but out no body said anything! Even dennys tells you have a good day on the way out, might not mean too much to some people, but it does me!! Will never go there again!"}
{"text":"There really is not much to say about this place. The staff was polite and attentive, the restaurant had a delightful ambiance, and the food was delicious. The only negative thing that I could say about the meal was that our brussels sprouts were slightly undercooked, but everything else was so amazing that I can easily overlook it."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal! Great service! From the starter to dessert everything was delicious. Try the pork belly, lobster mashed potatoes and strawberry butter cake! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. The ambience in the bar dining area was warm and inviting The staff goes out of their way to ensure that you have a five-star experience. I would highly recommend and definitely plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"We arrived right as the restaurant opened and first stopped at the bar for a drink. The bartender was friendly and quickly served us   Our waiter explained how the steak was cooked differently from most other restaurants. I was leery ordering my steak medium well as I like it pink in the middle. To my surprise Mu steak was outstanding!  We ordered three sides - baked potato, sugar snap peas and corn creme brûlée, all of which melted in my mouth!!  Our service and staff were second to none. They explained everything perfectly and were patient and willing to answer all questions.   I will definitely visit Steak44 on my next trip to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Great food in a small, loud restaurant and bar populated by neighborhood cougars and the men that love them, at least while they are there. As with any great steakhouse the side dishes  are the standout, at least for me (mac and cheese, spinach, mushrooms, whipped mashed potatoes etc) . Their seafood actually impressed more than the (very good) steaks and I've had halibut, tuna and the seafood tower there, all above average in quality, taste and value.  Heavy  wine list and strong cocktails lead to boisterous crowds. Severs are well trained and uniformly friendly based on at least 5 visits there. I'd go here over most comparable places in town, and PHX/Scottsdale has many high end steak places."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, awesome staff, but honestly, my food was just okay.  Potatoes and salads were ok, not off the charts.  Shared the bone in rib eye and it was okay, not off the charts.  My husband felt the same way.  Brussel sprout and mushrooms sides, awesome.  My son's shared the crab cakes and said they were awesome as were the cesar and chopped salads. I liked this place, was just mildly disappointed in some of the food."}
{"text":"In the typical steak house you seat in the poorly illuminated room with heavy environment and wish to finish your hopefully appropriately prepared steak asap and leave. This place is different. It is a place for happy upscale dining where you will be surrounded with nice people just like you. The atmosphere is very dynamic. You can get a booth for more private occasions. The staff is very knowledgable and caring. Food is delicious!! I'm very sorry for reviewers who had bad experience here! This was my 4th time at steak 44 and I had pretty incredible time. Definitely coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday dinner.  We had reservations and were seated right next to the bar, (literally, there was a railing between our table and the bar).  We noticed it was kind of loud when we were sat, but no biggie - I only turned 34, don't mind the noise.  But as our meal progressed, the table next to us - but technically in the bar - became louder and louder, screaming profanities and quite disgusting stories of their supposed sexual escapades.  My husband and I could not hear each other talk.  At one point I yelled just to see if anyone would even look, I was drowned out by the unfortunate crowd next to us and not a single person so much as even turned their head.    I went to use the ladies room and when one opened, another intoxicated man stumbled out.  He had relieved himself all over the seat, floor, etc.  I felt like I was in some college dive bar, not out for a special, $100 per person dinner.  I realize that some of this could not be prevented by the restaurant.  But I do think at some point the manager, or anyone really, should have approached the group of guys and just asked them to tone it down.  They were obviously bothering the patrons around us.  For the good - the food was delicious.  We both ordered the rib-eye and it was amazing.  The corn creme brule and dominic's potatoes were both quite good.  I was not impressed with the crispy asparagus.  It was blanched asparagus with a tempura batter.  Not crispy and not flavorful.  But really, I loved everything else and would return in a heartbeat had it not been for the ridiculously loud, frat party atmosphere.  Because of that I will not return."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5, arriving at opening time, 5pm. My steak was half \"medium plus\" as they call it and half Raw? Not sure how that happened. The signature potatoes were near raw, perhaps it was because it was at the opening of business but I find that not an excuse. One of our Party had the Chicken and it was really good, but chicken for 30 bucks? The service was very attentive and friendly. Bill for 5 was $500.  Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"not that this place needs anymore kudos but yes kids you will not be disappointed. I definitely was not. and I am picky. I am not really into steaks but a friend of mine wanted to go so I said what the hay. although I didn't get through the steak it was delicious and its a place that makes you feel good. you know its upscale and classy. I would definitely go back if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Great place for casual dining or for a special dinner date 5 star all tha way !  I went in by myself for my birthday because my family went on vacation they even brought me out a birthday cake very thankful to my server  ! Made my day very special thank you"}
{"text":"We took our youngest granddaughter to a family dinner at Steak44 as part of her 13th birthday weekend celebration, as she is a steak lover. The complimentary bread in the skillet pans is a nice touch, and the bread was good. Drinks are expensive but there were a few (very few) glasses of wine available for less than $10, and they do have a generous pour. Four of us ordered steaks.  The steaks were all delicious and cooked to perfection: medium rare +.  The side dishes served family style worked well and were tasty. The birthday girl was given a choice of a complimentary dessert, and she chose chocolate cake, which was served with her name on top and a candle.  The piece of cake was large enough it gave all at our table who wanted it a sample and still left her plenty to eat and even take home. The older granddaughter had the s'mores dessert, which was completed with a blow torch. The waitress and other serving staff were superb--friendly and attentive. They took our leftovers to box up to go. One negative is that both my husband and son complained of getting periodic blasts of cold air at their side of the table toward the end of the meal. All in all, we left happy with our experience at Steak 44.  We appreciated the fact we were able to access the menu for the restaurant on the Internet, with prices, ahead of time, so we knew it was going to be pricey. Our bill was in the price range of $$$$ not $$$ which is the price range showing on Yelp."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I loved Cork & Cleaver and was looking forward to the opening of Steak 44.   I took my son, daughter-in-law and two granddaughters with me for a celebration. I mentioned several times to the staff that it was their 15th wedding anniversary, but none of them said or did anything to make our visit a special occasion.   I couldn't believe that at such a nice restaurant the kids' drinks were served in styrofoam cups!   I was still looking forward to my steak only to find out that it was cheap, grain-fed steak, not pastured, grass-fed! Our steaks were served on plates so hot that they were sizzling and were overcooked in no time. Both were black on both sides. My son had to send his steak back initially, as his medium looked just like my medium-rare, and when it came back to him it was black, though it was cooked to medium. He couldn't eat a quarter of it because it was too hard to chew.  The Brussels sprouts and rolls were like rocks. The desserts were nothing special, and the kids didn't even want to finish them.   The one bright spot was the attitudes of the staff. They were lovely and proud to work there.  I will never return to Steak 44 again."}
{"text":"Amazingly good time! We went with all of Amanda's recommendations and we were grateful. She is great at what she does and you can tell she likes what she does. It was the first night we've spent in Phoenix & she represented her city & Steak 44 well.   Well we went back to back nights. John was our server this time. He was also outstanding.  Thank you Phoenix & Steak 44-we had a blast on our vacation."}
{"text":"I came into steak 44 again last night with a group of friends and sat on the patio. It seemed busy as always. Our server, Michael was terrific. He explained the menu and even suggested wines to pair with what we ordered.  All of our food was terrific! The corn brûlée was on of the best side dishes I've had. And we wouldn't have ordered it unless our server suggested it. Overall another great experience and I'm sure this restaurant is going to do very well! I just wanted to thank the staff and especially our server Michael for making our night out an amazing one. We will be back for sure, and I highly recommend trying out steak 44 if you haven't yet! Thanks again for another great dining experience.."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere.  Crispy Shrimp, Deviled Eggs, Oysters, Supersalad, and Bone-in ribeye, all great.  Happy Hour till 6.  Great drink and food menu choices."}
{"text":"We went to Steak 44 before going to a concert. It was a Wednesday night and the place was jammed. We were seated at a two top by the fireplace near the bar. We ordered the calamari to start. Nice big rings, not greasy. I had the filet which came out on the sizzling hot plate. Delicious. Hubby got the scallops. Also very good. We shared the baked creamed spinach which was really good. The baked potatoes..just ok. Sides are a little smaller than Mastro's but priced accordingly. Our server Matthew was excellent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place but beware....be ready to drop a lot of $$.  The steaks are butter cooked ( like Ruth Chris) so very tasty )  It's a Mastros restaurant so expect the best.    Service was wonderful, friendly and just the right attention."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Monday night! And I understand why. The atmosphere was great. It didn't have that high end steakhouse feel because of the bar area that was part of the restaurant with a couple of tvs. The food was top notch but the thing that made my night was the service. Our waitress Sarah was awesome and very friendly. She treated us like we were the most important table she was serving. The bus boy Tanner Jax was the cherry on top. He had conversations and jokes with me and my boyfriend. He was the one that recommended our dessert and it did not disappoint. The caramel cake was phenomenal. This restaurant is a must for anyone that is looking to have a nice steak dinner in Phoenix. I'm from Connecticut and I will always come here whenever I'm back in town. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"The consensus among our close friends and family is that Steak 44 serves not just the best steaks in Phoenix, but the best steaks anywhere.  My husband and I like having dinner at Steak 44 for special occasions, group dinners, and whenever we have out-of-town guests who enjoy steak.  While all the steaks we have tried there--the filet mignon, the bone-in filet mignon, the bone-in ribeye, the Tomahawk ribeye--are delicious, our absolute favorite item on the menu is the bone-in filet mignon.  It's incredible how much more flavorful the bone-in filet is than the boneless filet.  The steaks we have ordered are always perfectly seasoned and cooked (we prefer our steaks cooked medium rare).  While everything else on the menu is certainly good, the five-star rating is mainly attributed to the exceptional steaks and service.  The wine and cocktail selections are great.  And while I always have to resist filling up on the fresh, warm bread that is served before every meal, I still kind of miss the popovers from BLT Steak, which closed its AZ location.  We enjoy starting off with two to three oysters per person as an appetizer--we prefer west coast oysters, especially Kumamotos.  Additionally, I find the roasted beet salad to be refreshing and nice to share.  The sides are good, but no side is so spectacular that it would cause me to rave about it like their bone-in filet mignon.  If you have room for dessert, order the beignets, which are served as a \"beignet tree\" with sides of chocolate and vanilla cream dipping sauces.  While not as amazing as the beignets you would find in New Orleans, I rarely ever dine at Steak 44 without ordering this dessert item.  Like their steaks, the service at Steak 44 is also incredible.  The servers are attentive, polite, and knowledgeable.  Robbie Weiz, one of the managers, is awesome and always makes sure that customers are having the best dining experience possible.      The restaurant is clean and dimly lit.  It also has separate dining rooms to accommodate your needs.  When we dine with my grandmother at Steak 44, we make sure to ask for a table in one of the quieter rooms because she can't tolerate a lot of noise.  We enjoy eating on the patio or in the room shared with the bar with our friends, and we enjoy an intimate table in the main dining room when my husband and I go by ourselves.  My only minor complaint is that there are two areas in the restaurant in which we've dined where the ambiance was disrupted by the constant rattling of a window or glass--(1) we sat at a table in the back dining room (not sure what this dining area is called, but you walk past the kitchen and enter the area through a door) next to a window that rattled whenever anyone (mainly servers) entered or exited the dining area through the door (seats at other tables in this room were fine); and (2) we sat at a table in a cozy dining room adjacent to the kitchen and separated by glass, but the glass would rattle whenever servers put back their serving tray stands, which also caused a loud noise from the tray stands hitting each other.  But, since the service is so good, Steak 44 will make sure to move you to a different table if there is an issue.  It's a popular venue and always appears packed.  So, if possible, make reservations at least a week prior and, obviously, even more in advance if you anticipate having a large group.  We've never tried going without a reservation so I don't know what the wait is like without one, but we are seated either immediately or within minutes when we arrive with reservations.   The bottom line is that Steak 44 is among our favorite restaurants and has the best steaks and service!  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience. Went to Steak 44 to celebrate an engagement and were treated like kings and queens! Charles was professional and attentive. Couldn't have asked for better service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu - $10 for steak and fries is a steal.  But the winner tonight was the order of crispy shrimp.  Ask for a side of the cocktail sauce with atomic horseradish if you dare - sooooo yummy. Service was top notch and the drinks are fairly priced for an upscale establishment.  Too bad the Dungeness crab cocktail isn't on special - it's my dad's favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great atmosphere, and awesome food. Wanted to wait until my second visit before writing a review. The service and food was consistently excellent. Had perfectly prepared filet and lobster tail."}
{"text":"Great service and food, one of the best steak house atmospheres around.  Amanda, John, Harry and the rest are great (sorry I've forgotten names).   The appetizers are delicious, they have a great wine selection and even better entrees, the filet, ribeye, crab legs are what we get.  The tuna stack, meatballs and shishitos are what we start our night off with.  Love this dark wood and comfort you get when you walk in.  But the energy is high and vibrant with a mix of young and old. A great place for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"Disappointed!  Sweet 16 birthday and family dinner concluded with an allergic reaction to the NUTELLA in the chocolate dipping sauce.  I didn't expect this economic short cut from Steak 44.  We should have stayed with the stellar steak establishment we are already familiar with - The Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Exactly what I hope for when my wife and I want a nice night.  Super service, great menu, terrific atmosphere, not much else to ask for.   The staff was really friendly and really seemed to know their menu.   It was a little late, so we skipped the apps. We shared the crab cakes and the bone in ribeye with the lobster mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese sides.  Everything was excellent. Steak cooked perfect, crab cakes more crab than filler, and the sides were soooo good.   We skipped the desert also and I regret it now that I have read a few other reviews. They were mentioned in pretty much everyone.   Just wish we had one back home."}
{"text":"The service and the food was the best we have had in Phoenix! We had petite filets that were done to perfection and the best salad was very tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, crazy great food and super generous martini pours. My nervana. Go there, you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner. Filet Mignon obviously was tender, juicy and flavorful! Side dish was dominick's potatoes...they were ok. Hubby ordered the Ribeye. Also, juicy and still sizzling on the plate but didn't really impress me. They place bread on the table while you eat, Cheesecake Factory's is better. Servers were nice. Very attentive, but the actual waitress...she didn't make suggestions as far as the wine, it seemed as though we bothered her with our questions. I looked around to observe other tables to see if it was us...?  No. Another server was explaining to the table across from us with a smile. When you're paying $60 a plate, at least fake a smile! If you don't like you're job, quit. Will go again, but I will pick the waitress. I felt I was cheated of a good plate for lack of recommendation."}
{"text":"So, it was my Mom's 91st B-day last nite. We, as EXTREMELY longtime Arcadia residents, 4 generations worth, finally decided to try Steak 44, expecting Mastro-like quality and service. I asked for a quiet table in the back given the large span of ages, 5 - 91, so of course they placed us right off the bar, in the ridiculously fly-ridden nwc table. Still hoping for the best we started celebrating. Our family includes a number of serious foodies including 3 chefs, one of Manhattan ilk. All at the table are well versed in fine dining. However, I actually felt dispised by our server. He succeeded in offending every single adult at the table save my elderly parents who couldn't hear him and were completely ignored throughout. Although it was my dear ol' Dad that forked over the $650 at the end without a word after our server totally ruined his wife of 57 year's birthday. We got 6 filets of various sizes/bone inclusion and one rib-eye. Everyone was disappointed in the filets. Good quality meet prepared with no flavor. The sides were insanely small. Not only that, the server felt running around giving us each a teaspoon of potatoes and one asparagus spear was better than simply addressing the mistake honestly and bringing out more (or advising us properly ahead of time). He said sides typically serve 1 - 4. Really? How's that work? He literally even fought me on the complexities of bringing me a fresh glass of ice water!  Drinks were pouring at the other end of the table but he became indignant when he realized one of our guests knew more about wine than he and began arguing vs. simply going and finding out the answer requested. Strawberry cake was overcooked and too sweet. After ordering I asked him how long until the first course arrived to ensure we had enough time for my Mom to quickly open her gifts, take pics. He assured me we had 10 minutes to do so and then dropped the salads within 5, no comment, ruining the event. Got the best bone-in filet of my life at Mastro's north. Why not here? Maybe the manager carelessly barging in and out of our meal, while clearly not reading the situation right at all, coupled with the bowl of dilapidated Jolly Rancher candies proffered up on the way out (purchased from the local dollar store) kinda re-cap the overall mind-set here. They called me today to ask how our experience was. When I shared same including the fact none of us ever plan on returning she thanked me and did nothing to give me any feeling at all they valued our business."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal here, certainly on par with the best steakhouses in Phoenix.  We tried the filet and NY strip; both were tender, flavorful and perfectly cooked.  We also ordered the mac and cheese and crispy asparagus; the mac was good but not outstanding, and the asparagus was crispy-fried heaven.  Service was good despite the restaurant being very crowded - I definitely recommend reservations, even late on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times but this time was BEST EVER!!! We got a booth overlooking the kitchen and did not disappoint! Robert , the chef, took the opportunity to send us a couple extra treats and we felt so special!!! Daniel kept us taken care of with water and constant sea salt rolls!!! Our favorites include Shrimp Cocktail, shishito peppers, Macc and cheese, creme corn brûlée , mushrooms and filets! Don't forget to end with Caramel cake! We never skip this place when we visit Arizona!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, horrible nightclub-like ambiance  My husband and I took some business associates here on a Saturday night and boy is this place happening.  As in nightclub happening.  The small center has little parking so you are almost forced into Valet parking.  Not a problem, but we immediately felt out of place pulling in behind a Jaguar and in front of a Bentley.  The car parade is typical Scottsdale.  Then there are the patrons getting out of the cars.  Suffice it to say that the women are scantily clad. Definitely not a family restaurant (at least not on a weekend night) but good people watching for sure.  Once inside, loud music and streams of young party goers greeted us.  We were escorted to our table at the back of the restaurant, passing through the kitchen.  I will say, the seafood and dessert displays are amazing.  The restaurant decor is also very modern and nicely appointed. Our table was on the end by the doors to the kitchen so all night long we were blasted with the loud music playing in the kitchen and the rest of the restaurant.  Tables are also seated very close together so when we weren't fighting against the volume of the music, we were having to talk over those seated around us.  At one point we asked one of the hostesses if there was a quieter area and were told there were private booths but they were all booked for the night so they had nothing to offer us.  (Strange since we had asked for a quiet table when we made the reservation. We didn't know about the booths and really wish we had asked for one ahead of time.) I really have no complaints about the food and the service.  Our waiter promptly greeted us and took drink orders.  He really knew the menu. Freshly baked bread was brought out promptly and all of our food was timed nicely. The calamari/shrimp appetizer was tasty. We all ordered steaks and they were cooked to perfection and melt-in-your mouth tender and juicy. For dessert we ordered the beignet tree and vanilla and caramel drizzled cake, both were scrumptious.    Overall, the meal itself was fabulous. Unfortunately the overall experience left us not wanting to return.  For a $100+ per person business meal, I would like to be able to relax and carry on a conversation with the people with whom I'm dining.  The atmosphere here just doesn't lend itself to a nice expensive steak dinner, especially with so many other great choices here in town."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed Steak 44. Visiting from Texas where there are plenty of great steak/Chop houses, Steak 44 has it all. Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  I will go again when I am back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Beautiful and artful ambiance. Lots of energy. Great menu full of rich flavors. The Alaskan crab cluster was from a godzilla size planet. The beignet tree is mic drop worthy!! Best of all, the service from Rob and team was beyond amazing. The entire experience from start-to-finish was truly memorable. Thank you Steak 44."}
{"text":"This is by far the greatest steakhouse I've been too. Celebrated my wife birthday there and she absolutely loved it. Would totally go back."}
{"text":"Definitely need a reservation for wknds. If you want to go to top notch steakhouse with impeccable service than this is the place. Incredible"}
{"text":"Came here for my aunt and uncle's 50th anniversary dinner party.  We were placed in the kitchen view private room and service was great (with the exception of...read my 2nd paragraph) and food was more than delish!  For appetizer we had crispy shrimp, calamari and meatballs.   Main entree got the filet with creme brulee corn and asparagus. For dessert got the double pound cake with strawberries.  Everything tasted great!  Crispy shrimp was lightly deep fried with sweet chili sauce on top.  Calamari was also lightly deep fried and didn't taste fishy.  Meatball was surprisingly very good and juicy.  I got the filet cooked medium rare and it came out perfect!  This was a big chunk of meat for a filet!  Creme brulee corn tasted more like a dessert!  I wasn't too crazy with the dessert since the pound cake took over the poor strawberries.    Only reason I gave it a 4 star was because my cousin had asked for a wine list and they gave him the expensive list.   He thought that this was the only list they had and had spent $200 on a bottle that typically cost about $60.  We later found out there was a cheaper wine list out there!   I dunno but felt like the waiter did this on purpose to cheat us.  Why can't you place all wine on 1 menu rather than 2?  I thought this was a bit shady but then again we could've asked if there was a cheaper wine list."}
{"text":"What a great meal, filet and Ahi were cooked perfectly as well as our side dishes. Sat in the front room off the bar so we could see all the action. The place was really busy for a Wednesday night in August. Overall a great experience. Save room for the beignets."}
{"text":"Just a typical steak house. Steak was just alright but the rest of the food was good. Service was kind of slow but it's understandable because it was crowded (even on Wednesday night). For the same price range I would rather go to Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything was great, from the food to the customer service! We loved the oysters and steak of course. They called the next day to follow up, which I really like. Thank you for a great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group for a birthday. The hostess where very polite and helpful. The food was nothing to get excited over. I had the Halibut which came out very dry and bland. For sides we shared the crispy asparagus, sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts. I could not even eat the brussel sprouts, they were completely over done, greasy, and overly salted. The crispy asparagus was okay, but the sauce was horrible. The menu listed it as a spicy aioli. Unfortunately it was just mayo and ketchup. The sweet potatoes were another mess. Overly sweet mush. I probably would not eat here again. The ambience is nice and the bar seemed to be pretty happening."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I came here tonight for his birthday, and it was an incredible experience! It was our last night in AZ so we're glad we ended our trip on such a high note :) The food was amazing and so was the staff! Heather, her assistant, and the manager were all so nice! We will definitely be coming back next time we are AZ :)"}
{"text":"A wonderful steakhouse with excellent service. We asked for, and received, a quiet table in a booth with glass enclosure on three sides. We also had an excellent view of the pristine kitchen. The seafood looked spectacular and we hope to return and sample it."}
{"text":"Ok... if you don't know better, it is a good restaurant.  Not great, not wow, just ok food. Our steaks were ok, nothing to rave about, served in a burning hot plate that still cooks the steak (does it even make sense? ) and like my better half said,  i do better at home. That says a lot. The potatoes au gratin were undercooked and the mushrooms way too salty. The bread is the same as the one i would find at a Red Lobster or Outback (even if i did not step foot there for more than 10 years) which is a bummer. The service is okay, nothing memorable, nothing to comment on; in short, we would not come back just for the service. We did not order appetizer because we did not feel like it, and they kindly brought dessert when they heard our comments about the potatoes,  sweet, but no thank you; we are not so much into sweets. Instead we ordered espressos, good ones. Aaron at the bar is a Rock Star, fantastic drinks, pure talent, professionalism and personality,  and for this, we will come back. But when we will be craving steaks,  we will go to Donovan's,  because it is sincerely better there, better quality steaks, stellar service, just better. Not so much into Fox concepts,  where design and atmosphere matter more than food and service, Steak 44 fits that same profile. Too bad. Oh well, we tried it, we did not like it that much except the bar. Not a night to remember."}
{"text":"i went here while on business.  the fish (yes i had fish at a steak house) was great as were the large prawns.  very good food and outstanding service."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to after here. The food was great but the service was outstanding. The manager even called me the day after to see how my experience was. Would definitely recommend and I'll be coming back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The steak was fabulous! I also recommend the beat salad (I prefer with no goat cheese), brussel sprouts and mushrooms! Watch out for the Parmesan bread- it's makes your mouth water! Also, if you are into dessert then our group loved the mini s'more and it's great for sharing!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner. Have been to sister restaurant, Dominck's, a few months ago so I was excited. This place is great. Started with jumbo shrimp and crab legs. All of the seafood in flown in fresh daily. You can definitely tell. So good. I got the special Waygu beef and holy crap was it amazing. So incredibly tender. If you have never had Waygu, you have to get try it here. For the sides, we go many. The burlee corn (or whatever it is called) was really amazing. Did not expect that at all. The spinach and bussel sprouts were also very good, but I love spinach and brussels sprouts to begin with. We also got the lobster mash which is good but my least favorite of the four. If you can afford to go, I highly recommend trying this place. So worth it.   One benefit of this place over Dominick's is the lighting is much better here. It is so dark at Dominick's for some reason. Otherwise, both places are very similar."}
{"text":"Flawless evening!  Dinner for four to celebrate a birthday milestone, the two of us and two of our adult kids. We started with Oyster appetizers from the raw bar, which a couple of us enjoyed and 3 salads - the beet salad was a rave and the caesars could have had a bit more flavor in the dressing, but the poached egg was enjoyable. The complimentary rolls that came out right away were buttery, hot and light [mouth-clouds] .. We all had steaks that were sizzled to perfection with a couple of toppings, the bordelaise our daughter and son enjoyed and the truffle butter was just the flavor boost expected. Sides were the house potato au gratin, corn brûlée [as good as a dessert], wild mushrooms and the Brussels Sprouts, which even naysayers at our table enjoyed. Desserts were fun, tasty and generous including a complimentary birthday dessert.  Service was outstanding in every aspect; our server, Jane, was the perfect balance of informative, attentive and made solid suggestions.  Every wait staff member was friendly, with perfect pacing and non-intrusive.  It was a very busy Friday night yet  we were seated on the dot of our reservation.  Thanks Steak 44 for providing a memorable celebration, we will be back to our new favorite dining destination, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, food, and ambiance. Manager was extremely professional and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Every time I come here it's great'"}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite steakhouse in the valley. The food was incredible and I have been dying to go back again. Our waiter, Brian, was amazing and incredibly helpful and informative. His suggested appetizers and sides were spot on and only added to our love of this restaurant. I have told all of my friends and family that they have to try this place and they need to request Brian as their waiter!"}
{"text":"I was truly hoping that we would have a second fave steakhouse besides Mastros but we felt that Steak 44 missed the mark for us on both visits.  We went once just as a couple and another time with 3 other couples.  When the group of us was there, the service was ok, nothing special or particularly attentive.  We ordered a seafood tower and when I placed some cocktail sauce on my plate, a screw fell out.  As a way to \"make up for it\" they gave us a donut tree???   Maybe  it was that we are on the younger side and the other tables looked more promising or just didn't had a great experience but I don't think we will be rushing back.  The food was among the lines of the other steakhouse in the valley but nothing great.  I think the high point was the seafood tower even with the screw:)"}
{"text":"Always a great nite out when we head to S-44, never disappointed in drinks, great steaks and good friends. Hubby's filet was perfectly pink and aged expertly. My friend also got a filet but he went med well, not the best temp but he's had bad experiences elsewhere so a bit of ptsd, so we had to bring him here and change his outlook.  Hopefully it did and he vowed to go med rare next outing. My bone in ribeye was ginormous, I forgot to ask for the petite portion so took half home and My fur-baby boy Luke is licking his chops for the bone! Topped off nite w the brioche bread pudding chocholately ice cream dessert yumminess. It's a must as it always reminds me of St. Marco choco-croissants back in Tokyo. Happy holidays all and to all a great wknd!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals here. The steaks were cooked well and very tender. The negative was my husbands scallops that he said were tough.  Service was outstanding. The sides were delicious, although small. We had the mac and cheese, au gratin potatoes, fries, snap peas, brussell sprouts, corn brulee. Dessert was one of the best I ever had. It was a sundae with popcorn in it and home made fudge sauce. My husband had the chocolate cake which he said was very sweet, yet delicious. He could not eat much of it because it was so rich. My daughter had the smores in a jar and my son had the peanut butter milkshake. They give you rolls with a delicious seasoning in a cast iron pan for the table. We were very happy with the dining experience but make sure you have plenty of credit available on your credit card because you will need it!"}
{"text":"We loved it and why!  We are celebrating our 20th anniversary here in Scottsdale all the way from Michigan.  Must read this review!  We almost left... The place was stylish, packed with well dressed people but causal and definitely the hot place to be on a Friday night.   However, as expected the wait was very very long.  We looked around at the bar area for seats but no luck.  As we were about ready to leave, a women at the bar signaled us that they were leaving and we squeezed through the crowded area and took over two seats.  We were just happy to be seated.    THE SERVICE At this point we were not expecting too much since the bar was shoulder to shoulder, then Brian Kelly, the bartender showed up.  We instantly realized that our bartender was not your normal bartender.   He was as good as any 5 star server at your premier restaurants.   He made us feel like we were his only customer at all times, his recommendations were perfect, explained the menu as if he was the chef, described the food to perfect detail, kept our drinks full and we never wanted for a thing.  It turned out that we actually had the best seats in the house!!  Just people watching was fun :)  THE FOOD We started out with the colossal shrimp cocktail and oysters (Amazing!), then we split the bone-in rib-eye with lobster tail and a couple sides of deliciousness (mushrooms and brussel sprouts). The ribeye was cooked to perfection (medium rare plus 1), the lobster was super tender and mouthwatering all while enjoying our bottle of Robert Craig.   The dessert took us over the edge, can't spell it -beignets?-but it was a superior fried doughnut that put Krispy Kreme to shame and two glasses of Dolce that put the cherry on top.     Thank you Steak 44 for a great evening and making our dinner one to remember.   Don't pass this place up.  Go see Brian Kelly at the bar!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We dined here Friday night with friends and all expectations were exceeded. Interesting apps (loved the fried deviled eggs), fresh salad of heirloom tomatoes, and a perfectly cooked filet. And the strawberry butter cake was considered best dessert ever by all at table.  Cheers to the wine list..all price points possible.   We were seated in a back room after going through the kitchen. It was nice and quiet and far removed from the more boisterous bar and other dining area. Just make sure you let them know the vibe you seek."}
{"text":"I was the #1 Cork and Cleaver fan so I was pissed for over a year and not thrilled. However we went last week and maybe they had all the bell's and whistles out cause the opening but this is Mastro's best yet.  Food was awesome, great staff, I'd give it an easy 4.5/5.0. #UTRIP"}
{"text":"Service is fine, bar is nice, steaks are just OK.  Ambiance is a little too nouveau riche for my taste, which is why I probably won't be back.  Regardless, definitely not a better steak than City Hall."}
{"text":"I didn't really care for this restaurant I don't think I'll be returning it's a nice restaurant but the price would suggest good food and I thought the food to be mediocre and the service mediocre also so I gave this restaurant three stars simply because it's a nice looking place"}
{"text":"Wow. Went with friends the other night.  Delicious food and a good extensive menu for a steakhouse.  Their appetizers and side dishes are easily as good as the entrees.   Definitely a FIND."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't eat at places like this very often but I can say this is probably the best food I've had in a long time. I went with the bone in filet and it was cooked perfectly. The charred option was great and I'd recommend it. We had several sides but the one that stuck out to me was the creamed corn. Lastly, the three layer chocolate cake for dessert was the best cake I've had. In summary, nothing we had was bad. I'm not sure you could go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"All good things to say here. Service:  attentive, timely, precise. Food:  not a moment of unhappiness from our party of 4.  Beef was well aged with appropriate flavor. Drinks:  full and well-made. Atmosphere:  I've been going to Scottsdale and Phoenix for 30 years from NY and DC, there's nothing lacking in sophistication here.  Hopping, does not miss a beat. Was recommended by a friend from NY.  44 was the dining highlight of our vacation."}
{"text":"Is there a meal you have had that you will never forget?  You will never forget this place.  The food is amazing.  You really could cut your steak with a fork.  It is that tender and delicious.  Forget the steak sauce.  You will enjoy the flavor of the steak just as is.  It comes out on a 400 degree plate.  The sides,  Absolutely wonderful.  They put a little twist on each one and 1 side is more than plenty to share.  But get two,  it is impossible to pick just one.  The service,  unbelievable.  The best ever.  We were a large group of 20.  They put us in a room of our own.  We had 5 waiters/servers who were very attentive,  friendly, fun and I know it is a big job when you ask to have separate checks for everyone, but the waiter did and there was not one mistake on anyone's check.   Some of us finished with a dessert.  The red velvet bread pudding was lush.  It wasn't too sweet and even though I was full, I still had to have another bite.    If you are looking for a great steak, you must absolutely try this place.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner tonite! Crab cakes and scallops were awesome, and when we mentioned that the crispy shrimp was really salty, they immediately recommended another shrimp dish and wisked the salty one away! The manager came by, made sure we were okay, and Rebecca could not have been nicer. We are from Chicago and can't wait til it opens there."}
{"text":"had dinner first time 5 stars i have smoked salmon business in seattle 37 years  i know when it dam good merry christmas larrys smokehouse"}
{"text":"Great steak cuts, perfectly prepared, nice hot plate. Sides were awesome and service very good! We will go back."}
{"text":"Depends what you're looking for.  Atmosphere? - yes!   Service - outstanding!   Nice wine list.  I just didn't think the food rated the high prices.  In my opinion it was over salted and one of our steaks was over-charred.  Salads were average and I do like my salad.  Heavy on the potato selections, and the other veggies were slightly over done."}
{"text":"I'll take this restaurant over Ruth's Chris any day of the week. Best steak restaurant I've been to!"}
{"text":"This is legitimately the best steak I've ever eaten in any state/country. It isn't cheap to be certain... but it is insanely good. Get the ribeye black and blue. Even if you don't eat rare meat, it'll change your religion."}
{"text":"Look no further for that premier place for those special occasions in your life. Steak44 has everything I'm looking for in a great restaurant, the food, the ambience, and great service. Our party was seated promptly at our reservation time. Our table overlooked the tasteful decor near the bar area. The waiter recommended the special steak called the Tomahawk and all his promises were realized after the first bite. From appetizers to desserts we enjoyed a wonderful meal. The professional wait staff only added to my impression of this terrific restaurant. You won't regret making Steak44 your choice for a great night out in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Steakhouse are challenged to come up with a way to set themselves apart. Steak 44 did it by simply serving the best meal, backed by excellent service.   My wife and ordered an appetizer, 3 entrees, and 4 sides. No need to list them. All excellent.  We were next to a raucous table, which didn't bother us, but the manager offered to move us. Nope. We were fine with it. But we did request they dim the light, and they did, immediately.  It's our new Go To restaurant."}
{"text":"Make sure to reserve in advance because they book up fast! We loved the ambiance and decor. Amazing food.. steak will literally melt in your mouth. To start off we had the crab and avacado stack - definitely yummy but not sure if it's worth $20. We had the cream brûlée corn and lobster mashed potatoes as sides and they were both SO good! From the hostess, server to the bus boys - service was awesome! Martinis are very strong ;) We loved Steak 44 and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5 but I'm feeling generous. Unfortunately I did not catch my bartender's name but the drinks were strong and well made. The meatballs that they advertised on AZ Central a while back were a bit dry but they took it off my bill so no complaints there. The filet was on point. The braised pork belly was a little too sweet for my liking but that didn't stop me from eating all of it. Definitely will bring the DH back for some steak. And, did I mention that the service was superb!"}
{"text":"I took my mom here a couple weeks ago for a belated birthday dinner and we had such a great time! We were impressed from start to finish. The hostess (Danielle I think was her name) helped me in getting the flowers I brought ahead of time on the table, which was a great booth located near the glass kitchen so we could watch the magic happen. There was even a birthday card from the GM on the table as well, which was a nice touch. The food was outstanding! We both got the filet and both were cooked perfectly. Our waitress, Sarah, was so knowledgeable, friendly, and had a wonderful sense of humor. She did such an amazing job on making sure everything was perfect. She recommended the lobster mac as one of our sides and we were so happy she did! Delicious! Along with the amazing butter cake for dessert, they also brought out mini chocolate chip cookies made in house (with some extra for the road). I am pretty sure we closed out the restaurant that night! It's nice seeing a restaurant really go the extra mile and pay attention to the details. I cannot wait to go back and try one of the infamous seafood towers next!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service, food, wine and atmosphere! Staff was superb and great vibe all around. I had the halibut and it was out if this world! Definitely one of my newest favorites!"}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks, phenomenal food and awesome atmosphere. Love this place! Great for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Our first visit and we'll definitely be back.  Shrimp cocktail was outstanding.  I love that you can mix the cocktail sauce to your liking.  Steaks are cooked with a broiler which is fantastic at searing for the perfect rare steak.  We ordered Dominick's Potatoes and Corn Créme Bruleé as sides and were not disappointed.  Finished our meal with the Brioche  Bread Pudding which was great.  Best steakhouse in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a steakhouse snob and I generally hold them to the highest standard, but Steak 44 exceeded all my expectations and more. It started with the service. Our waitress Alyssa was honest, fun, attentive, and an overall joy to be around. We will go back just to see her. We ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer and it was phenomenal. Great flavor and the perfect size for a few people to snack on. We each had steaks and I must say the 22oz bone-in rib eye was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The corn creme brûlée is a must, as are the roasted Brussel sprouts and the lobster mashed potatoes. Finally, the atmosphere was terrific. It seemed like a place where the staff will know your name and that is what will keep us going back. If you're lucky enough to get Alyssa as your waitress you will have a great meal with even better service."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Excellent service and they went out of the way to help with our birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"As previously mentioned, this restaurant is pricey but DEFINITELY worth it. My husband and I made a last minute reservation for our wedding anniversary and were promptly seated upon arrival. Our server and his assistant were FANTASTIC. Everything we ordered was delicious and was recommended by our servers, and very satisfying. We had a nice romantic dinner, we got hot hand towels to clean our hands and were surprised with a DELICIOUS caramel cake to celebrate our special occasion. I loved every minute of this experience and would recommend everyone to go."}
{"text":"I took my dad there for his birthday last night-he is a big meat and potatoes kind of guy, and he loves a good steak.  This place did not disappoint! He got the filet-and said it was the best steak he had had, I got the meatloaf-and we all Loved it.  And for dessert we had the Red Velvet bread pudding, and their version of Strawberry Shortcake- we couldn't decide which was better.  The staff were all so helpful and available.  Would recommend this for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a steak! The steak I had, the wagyu 8oz filet was cooked perfectly. My only complain was that the plate was so hot, the butter was popping all over me.  We had a seafood tower as well. The blue point oysters were fresh and tasty.  For dessert we had the beignet tree. The beignets were good but not great. Not light and pillowy, as i believe one should be. They were a little harder, as if they may have been slightly over cooked.  The service was great. Everything came out in proper time and everyone was very accommodating. A great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Will not recommend a steak in Phoenix beyond 44. Though the restaurant is fairly loud the food is amazing. My personal favorite remains the bone-in filet though I often eat the ribeye as well. Oyster selection is always good for starters. Awesome."}
{"text":"Let me start off with, the food was AWESOME!!!! Most of the party I was with had steaks. The taste of the meat was by far the best steak I've ever eaten. Our waitress Nicole was on top of everything. We were here for my husband's birthday and instead of one dessert for him, they brought out two, second was complimentary.  Atmosphere inside was so inviting. They go above and beyond to making you have an enjoyable dinner experience."}
{"text":"we experienced excellent service but mediocre and overpriced food. Lamb chops were ok...nothing special; salmon was much under cooked. sides were both expensive and very mediocre. corn was apparently right out of a can; mushrooms were dry and tasteless, creamed spinach was gummy and not freshly prepared. our first visit and we will not return. very expensive and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Went to Steak 44 for a family birthday party. Food was great BUT we were sat in the middle of two of the most obnoxious diners I have ever seen. They took turn screaming and yelling. The manager did nothing to quiet either group down. The worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I will never go back the manager never apologized to us, offer to move us, or buy us a drink. There are many other high dinner places in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Wow.... This place has got it.  Truly beautiful atmosphere, the entire staff is super friendly... It was our friends birthday, and I think it was the owner (if his name is Dan) that brought over a birthday card.   Our server was Michael. He was incredibly good. Very polite, explained everything thoroughly, and and was very accommodating.   The food was outstanding! Their signature mashed potatoes, the sweet potatoes and the asparagus fries are amazing.   The lighting in there was also incredible.   At the end Dan came over to make sure everything was perfect, and sent out some desserts for us and our friend :)  The only thing I was not a fan of was the music. It ranged from reggae to old school, and something in between. Didn't seem to match the class of the restaurant in my opinion.   But over all a great experience with some great people, and I definitely hope to go back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I planned an engagement last week and it was amazing. The staff was perfect and helped with all accommodations. I will come back to this restaurant and recommend it to everyone. The food was amazing! Thanks again for everything!"}
{"text":"I think with 600 reviews all almost 5 stars iMessage been written about this restaurant to make you go there. All I'll say is it was excellent I had a great time and I highly recommend that other people go there when they are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is bangin.  Top notch food with great service.  This is truly one of those places where you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ocean Club has been replaced with Steak 44 as my top 5 restaurant. This place is a can't miss."}
{"text":"Good but not great.   Service: commendable. Accommodated us on a Sunday night without a reservation. Very polite and attentive.   Atmosphere: comfortable but loud. Capital Grill has them beat on this one.   Steaks: not worth the price. I got bone in ribeye, friend got bone in filet. Both were well seasoned and appropriately cooked, but tasted chewy and tough for prime grade steaks. At $50 a steak, chewy and tough shouldn't be words I use to describe my steak.   Sides: Corn creme brûlée one of the best things I've ever eaten. Baked potato meh. Asparagus $1 a spear, pass. Should have gotten lobster Mac and cheese or some kind of mashed potato. Bread was amazing.   Overall: would rather fork out for Mastro's or Capital Grill, but not a bad meal by any means."}
{"text":"Steak 44 is my go to place for special occasions, or just for a good steak.   The service, the food, the atmosphere...everything is spot on.  I try to go several times throughout the year, and not once have I had a complaint.   Yes, it is pricy, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Probably the best food and service in the greater Phoenix area. I prefer Mastros or Elements more when it comes to Ambiance; however, the food and cocktails cannot be beat at Steak 44.   The dirty martini was the best I've ever had. Lobster was delicious and you'll definitely want to scrap the side dishes clean...well, actually, you'll need to ask the server to do so because they serve everything to you table side.  One downside is the location. Not the most picturesque and not a great area for walking after the meal."}
{"text":"I've been here 6 times now and have never been disappointed, I haven't had a meal this good since dining in New York or SF and the service is impeccable.  I'm in the service business myself and tend to be highly critical of sub-par service and have found this place to exceed expectations every time.  Excellent wine list and huge selection of liquor. The manager Dan and the GM Frank regularly check the floor to ensure that everything is proper.  You can dress formally or GQ casual.  I can't say enough good things..."}
{"text":"My husband and I waited and waited for Cork & Cleaver to re-open but were pleasantly surprised to hear that Steak 44 (of Mastro's fame) was opening there. We decided to go for my birthday last night. We were seated at a two-top table right at the corner between two rooms. Our server and the busboys were all very nice however it was very difficult for us to hear anything they were saying because of the noise level. Our server was describing some of the various items on the menu and I only heard bits and pieces of what he was saying. The entire evening, my husband and I had to keep repeating ourselves because the noise level was so extreme.    We ordered the fried calamari and shrimp as an appetizer because I like calamari and my husband likes shrimp. While there was a very ample portion of calamari, there were only 2 small shrimp in the order. My husband mentioned his disappointment to our server and he did send the manager over who apologized and comped the appetizer. That was very nice of him to do that. By the way, the calamari was delicious - cooked to perfection (not rubbery).  I had the filet mignon and my husband has the bone-in ribeye - both were cooked exactly the way we ordered them and were delicious. I also had the Dominick's potatoes and the brussels sprouts. The potatoes were good but not really special but the brussels sprouts were wonderful. We had the red velvet bread pudding for dessert. It was good but perhaps a little too sweet.  All in all, I thought the food and the service was great. I could not, however, give it 5 stars due to the noisiness of the restaurant - I left there with a headache. I would highly recommend the restaurant for its food and service, however, I would not recommend going there for a quiet or romantic dining experience."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, food, and adult beverage selections. I would highly recommend going very hungry."}
{"text":"Service and food was wonderful! I had to turn in my sea bass for scallops and they were so kind and accommodating about it!  I felt so bad, but they went out of their way to make sure I loved my meal!! This restaurant is worth every dollar and we will all be back again soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity. The service was excellent, the menu was amazing. There's a huge wine selection (although that doesn't really do much good for me since I don't like the stuff), so my sister was happy with that. The steaks come out on 500 degree plates and the butter sizzles while they serve you. They spoon  the a la carte sides onto your sizzling plates and then it's super deliciousness. They bring out these amazingly hot buttery garlic parmesan-y bread knots while you wait for your entree. The Caesar salad was legit the best and most authentic Caesar salad ever. We split the off-the-menu chocolate cake for dessert and it was enough chocolate to cure my week-long chocolate cake craving.   Steak 44, you've won a place in my heart and stomach. If I'm in PHX again, I'm definitely hitting you up!"}
{"text":"Just celebrated my birthday on Saturday! I cannot thank Matthieu and all his staff enough! First it was a group of 15 of us and I know how overwhelming this can be. Thank you so much for the great service and your patience!  The food was amazing, the steak was cooked to perfection I also highly recommend the sautéed sweet corn and the roasted Brussels sprouts! Thank you once again for a very nice experience and thank you Matthieu once again for your wonderful service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Worth every penny! It gave me the feeling of Christmas as a child. Honestly almost brought tears of joy when the flavors of the sides and steak mixed. Cant wait to go back for another special occasion."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Very loud. I would recommend doing something to add panels to absorb and cut the noise down a bit. Other wise it was great. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  If we could rate over 5 stars, we would.  Excellent food, impeccable service...just an incredible dining experience all the way around.  Our waiter, Rob, was informative, diligent and on top of every aspect of our dinner.  Steak 44 vaults to the top of our list of top restaurants anywhere...and we've been to some of the nation's finest."}
{"text":"Very good food! The fried deviled eggs were very interesting and the dipping sauce was tangy. The bread was amazing! Filet was very good. The lobster cheddar potatoes were very good but a bit pricey. Brussel sprouts were very tasty. The red velvet bread pudding was also very good!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than five stars. Im a foodie--Been in the business for 30 years. Been to many great steak houses around the country over the years. Went here last night for our wedding anniversary. Couldn't have had a more perfect experience. The service, the ambience and most of all the food. Tried hard to find something to criticize but I failed.  Might just have to be our favorite restaurant ever. I was really blown away this morning when we received a call from them to ask how our experience was.  That' customer service. They care!!!  Absolutely wonderful. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Very good place! Service, ambiance, food and wine list. The atmosphere is not quite what it used to be, though. This place used to have a great casual but elegant feel. In general, very good place, I recommend to visit it."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my new Happy Hour and formal dinner favorites:) The atmosphere is very upscale and sophisticated. It's crowded during happy hour every Friday night, which is when I typically visit. I love the wine list and drink list. The dinner menu is fabulous. All of the wait staff has been wonderful every time I have visited. We typically do not make reservations when we come but I would recommend making them if you have a party more than two. I would highly recommend this place for an upscale Happy Hour or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and just love it.  Atmosphere is fun.  Food is always consistent and delicious.  However, the thing that wows me each time is the exceptional service.  It is so rare to find gracious and professional service anymore and it is what keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The atmosphere is nice and friendly. Service is great and very accommodating since we had a large party. The food is absolutely delicious. I had a steak and it was melt-in-your-mouth perfection.  I highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion."}
{"text":"High end steakhouse. Good wine selection. However, loud and filet was very salty. Waitstaff is good. Not worth the the money. Go to Ruth's Morton's or Capital Grill"}
{"text":"One of the best overall dining experiences you can have. It's a little loud and seating a little tight, but I feel that adds to the experience if you're ok with that. Every side dish is a home run. The Tomahawk wagyu is the best steak I've ever eaten. Service, awesome. There's a lot of pride in how the food is served and how you're treated as a customer.  I've been 5 times and will continue to support Steak 44."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Nice place, nice decoration but the food is just meh.  The wedge salad was good, the spinach was OK but the pork belly was't that great.  The prices aren't that bad, so I would say the place is a 3.5 but when it comes to round up I'll go to 3 with this place.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place for my bday dinner and it was SO yummy!! For dinner my boyfriend and I shared a steak and lobster with a side of the scalloped potatoes and lobster mac&cheese. Overall it was a great experience and seriously delicious food!! The only awkward/ downside to the night was that when we wanted our food boxed it was forgotten. We asked for it to be boxed but we never received our leftovers. Which sucks because it was quite a bit of food. I felt bad going around and asking where our food went so we just let it go, which is a shame since it was legitimately delicious stuff!! Either way, I will be back"}
{"text":"Steak 44 was a great experience our Son took us there for his Dads 59th birthday. The service was exceptional, we started with the Chief's PB&J, Braised Pork Belly both were excellent. Our next course was the Steak Knife BLT wedge salad. Our main course was the Wagyu Tomahawk 40oz steak which we shared with a side of mashed lobster and crab potatoes. We ordered lobster and crab Mac and cheese but they brought the potatoes and we just ate them. We also had broccoli.  Because it was my husbands birthday they gave him his choice of dessert so he chose the beignet and they brought him ice cream with a candle."}
{"text":"I have had steak in every major city in the US,this is by far the best. Not sure how they prepare the steaks but they were out of this world. The appetizers, sides and salads were also fantastic"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best steak house I've ever been too! This was my first time here, so we ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer and boy oh boy was it amazing! It was cooked to perfection and had the perfect crisp and seasoning to it. It was served with 3 different sauces, marinara, I believe tartar sauce, and another one that I have no idea what it was but it was delish! I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend ordered the NY strip and we got the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese and whipped potatoes with bacon! Everything was so delicious but I definitely recommend the Mac and cheese!!  We will definitely be coming back! I also recommend making reservations because they are usually booked."}
{"text":"Service was good, not great.  Started off with the fried deviled eggs which were interestingly tasty.  King crab leg seafood tower came with 4 different sauces,  watch out that atomic horseradish didn't get its name for nothing.  Both the New York strip and bone in Filet were outstanding, flavored well, tender and cooked perfectly!  Wasn't a fan of the Dominic's potatoes, thought they lacked flavor.  Would HIGHLY recommend the creme brûlée creamed corn, it was out of this world!  Finished with their version of the warm butter cake, which didn't disappoint.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak and was cooked to perfection, sides were average but we definitely didn't leave any. Service was great at the bar every time"}
{"text":"Disclaimer, I don't usually like steakhouses because of the prices. So, I thought for sure I wasn't going to like this place.   I went on a date night with the hubby. I was blown away by the ambiance. The restaurant was nice looking and seemed like they are always packed. The only complaint was it was too loud I could barely hear my husband talking. But I sure heard everyone else's conversation.  Hearing him didn't matter after we got our food :)     The food was amazing! I started with the chopped salad. It had artichoke - roasted red peppers - red onion - locally grown iceberg + romaine - parmesan (minus no parmesan and red onions) so delicious. Husband got the Super Food salad with baby arugula + kale - sriracha sunflower seeds - seasonal berries - goat cheese - champagne fig dressing.  I got the bone in ribeye and husband got the filet mignon.  Holy deliciousness! I have never been in love with a steak before and we go to a lot of Steakhouses because the husband loves them. We should have just ordered steak. We got pretty full. But... I'm not leaving out the best dessert and we got the red velvet bread pudding made with white chocolate - sweet cream cheese - vanilla gelato... OH MY GOODNESS :)    Our server was Megan and she was pretty awesome. We will be coming back once we save up some funds JK lol. It is to be expected to be crazy expensive. But worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar for happy hour. They have plenty of bar staff, and they are all friendly, attentive, and on subsequent visits remember your name and what you order. My favorite on the happy hour menu is the shrimp cocktail. Now I'm not talking an ordinary shrimp cocktail! They are the largest freshest \"shrimp steaks\" you have ever seen. I can only eat two but you order how many you want. Two are plenty for one person. The shrimps are served on a separate ice bed and on a separate plate are two sauces; one is a mayonnaise based sauce, and the other is a ketchup based sauce. On the plate is also a substantial amount of fresh horseradish. Warning before you add it to the sauce, fresh horseradish is much hotter.  I love it so I mix the majority of it into the ketchup based sauce.   The shrimp steak I cut into small bites with a knife and fork and enjoy it slowly so I can savor the yummy goodness of the sauce and fresh shrimp.  I pair it with Malbec which marries nicely with the spicy sauce."}
{"text":"First visit to Steak 44 last night and all I can say is WOW!!! I've been to the steak 48 in Chicago with family in December, and this time with friends in phoenix and both with the same server Brian.  What an Amazing experience once again!!! Brian's vibrant energy and impeccable service stands out!!! Recommendations spot on!! We started with 2 of there house favorites. The crab and avocado stack and crispy shrimp. Both were AMAZING!!!! As far as steak, It's hard for me to stray from my normal steakhouse go-to petite filet mignon but Brian explained how the bone-In  filet would be just as lean and tender, but with more flavor and his passion for it won me over!! SO GLAD I DID!!! My steak was cooked to perfection!!!! I enjoyed every bite and truly without a doubt the best steak I've EVER had!!! EVER:)) The sides were delicious (corn-creme-brûlée) sooooo gooooood:))). The Lavender scented warm towels after our table was cleared is such an amazing touch:)))  For dessert I already knew going in I was getting there Ultimate Warm vanilla Carmel Cake, and sorry, but there are no words that can describe how good it tasted:)) I can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"The exceptional service started with valet and carried on through dessert. We couldn't have asked for a more delightful experience to celebrate our anniversary and the engagement of our friends. The wine, appetizers, steaks, sides and dessert were all delicious! The staff knows how to take your special occasion to the next level. If you're considering it, don't hesitate another moment; make your reservation today!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The Hess Chardonnay on Happy Hour is a good price/intersects quality price. And love the Dungeness Crab cocktail. Parking, however, is crazy. Everyone in the back parking lot double parks. ... Purposely? Is this a Scottsdale/Biltmore thing?"}
{"text":"A great steakhouse!  Friendly staff and amazing food!  After only one visit it surpassed Flemmings, Mortons and Mastros as our favorite steak!  The Bone In Ribeye was fantastic.  Appetizers, sides, entrees and deserts where all spot on!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect...service and food is beyond compare.  Sad I don't live in Phoenix!  Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Top notch service and place overall but the food is what sets this place above some other high end restaurants. Huge menu and wine list. Do not miss this spot if in town!"}
{"text":"We came there about 45 min early and they seated us right away. We got a good table. The place filled up quickly on a Friday night. Our waiter Josh was very professional. The atmosphere is such that you can have a business dinner, date, or special occasion.  I started with my usual Caesar salad. It was good and I liked the addition of a poached egg on top. It had a good amount of grated cheese on top. My friend got the superfoods salad and loved it.  The bone in filet (the smaller one) was amazing. It was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. We split four sides between three of us. The creme brûlée corn was killer. The waiter recommended it and we added it at the last minute. Worth every calorie!! The roasted sweet potatoes with marshmallows was another hit. They didn't skimp on the sweet and gooey marshmallow cream on top of the savory potatoes. Both those sides would be a great addition to any Thanksgiving table.  The Brussels sprouts were ok. The creamy Mac and cheese was death-row-meal worthy! I ate way to much because everything was soooooo good.  We split dessert, the crispy banana split, which was also yummy and had enough ice cream and lots of whipped cream. It was one friend's birthday and they added a candle and wrote Happy Birthday on the plate.  Timing was a little off. It took awhile for my cocktail. I would wait to order my main dish until after the salad because the food came out fast. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My family had frequented the cork and cleaver and were so so sad when it burned down. We waited and waited for what new place would be resurrected... Well Steak 44 did not disappoint. We had a fantastic experience. The decor was modern and stylish , the food was absolutely amazing. From the warm bread, to the flavorful shrimp appetizer, and the Mac n cheese, creamed spinach and the del monte steak that we all shared was so delicious. The service from ever single person we encountered was above and beyond and so kind. We just sat in the bar!!! Amazing experience. Can't wait to go back! Next time I visit My hometown AZ from SD."}
{"text":"This place deserves all the high ratings it gets.From the moment we drove up to the moment we left,  the service was superb, First , the parking attendants Took our car instantly,even with several cars showing up at the same time. Next, we go inside,check in and are shown to our table immediately ,right on the reservation time. From there on the table service was excellent ,especially the assistant waiter, an assistant waiter, helping the regular waitress!! Imagine that !! We ordered drinks and while my martini was not cheap , it was a very generous pour,with extra in the shaker. My wife ordered the crab cakes.I had the rib eye..both with Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts...all GREAT.The steak was perfect Coming from New York and living there for many years, we know excellent restaurants and this place rates with the best. Very happy that the former owners of Mastro's came back . Oh, and the restaurant is beautiful."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, atmosphere, attention to detail and service.  Highly recommend this high-end steakhouse (bring your Black credit card!)  We had a very positive experience at this restaurant celebrating a birthday last month.    Our food was cooked to perfection, plentiful and super delicious.  Portions are large, enough to share and/or certainly a great \"take-home extra\" option.  The service was attentive and right on target.  We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at this luxury steakhouse.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has great energy and fantastic service. The free valet is a nice touch.  The steaks we had were just okay though...not bad, but not as amazing as I'd expect at this price point.  The crispy shrimp appetizer was amazing though! And the decor made up for the lackluster steak."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. But my recent experience was a disappointment. I was with my parents & my 19 yr old daughter celebrating Dad's birthday. We came for happy hour and were happy with the selections on the menu, but the music was so incredibly loud! We asked 4 different people including the hostess and the manager if they could turn the music down. They moved us to a ' quieter' spot in a side room but in fact there was a speaker overhead there too. The service was ok - it fell off as the evening wore on ( And I've had this same server before who wasn't too great then either).  When my 19 yr old daughter arrived, she was shocked at how loud the music was; that's when I knew it wasn't just me ! And - when we left, I walked outside and my ears were ringing. They hurt...as though I had been to a loud concert.  Disappointing experience !   ~ great location, great food, marginal service and marginal atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner. The service was ok and the food was above average. Not sure it was quite worth the money. The dessert however was fantastic. Without the dessert, this would have been a 3 star review."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was amazing. I LOVED their mashed potatoes and asparagus. Definitely an Arizona fave."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Steak 44!!  I've been very fortunate to get reservations every time we've been there.  Steaks have come out PERFECT each and every time!  Great place to go for a special occasion or just wanting a great steak!  If you have room left in your stomach or are smart enough to take food home, get the red velvet cake...AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We usually go to Ruth's Chris for steak, but after driving by Steak 44 for the 100th time, we thought we'd give it a try for our anniversary.   We made a reservation for 6 on a Sunday, and we were seated immediately in a quiet back room. Matt, our server, was attentive but not overly so. The manager Daniel stopped by to chat halfway through the meal and when he found out it was our anniversary, he told us to save room for dessert.   That was hard to do! I had the small strip with bleu cheese on top, with a side of hasselback potatoes. My husband had the steak, no bleu cheese, with a baked potato on the side. We both loved the hot rolls straight out of the oven.   Dessert was incredible - a warm butter cake with ice cream and caramel sauce, and warm beignets with vanilla and chocolate sauces on the side. The presentation was incredible, too!  We'll be back before our next anniversary. :)"}
{"text":"The company I work for has hosted their annual holiday dinner at Steak 44, for two of the three years I have worked for them. We get our own room, in the back, as to not disturb those around us, or vice versa. Both times, the food was amazing, drinks were delicious, and my husband and I, both, leave absolutely stuffed, and with enough leftovers for another meal. Pretty awesome place, for a massive group, like this.   I have never been here without a group, so I can't say if the serving sizes would be the same, but I am sure the food is equally delicious, either way."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Matt was our server and he did an amazing job. I was celebrating my birthday everyone made sure we were having a great time. We were in a louder part of the restaurant but it was still a great experience. I had been there before and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"trying to come here for a while now and let me tell you it was worth the wait this is now my favorite steak house I think and I've been to many I got the 22 ounce bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly so amazing and tender and I like the fact that they wet age instead of dry age so you don't get any of that musky flavor my wife had the lamb which seriously was the best lamb I've ever had it was juicy tender seasoned to perfection and cooked just right but she punched me cuz I tried taking too much she's not here I guess now for the sides I would highly recommend the corn creme brulee and the fried asparagus that was the highlight the mac and cheese sucks I think out of the box taste better their deserts are good but would go some where else to get them the only downside is a place is nosey as hell you can barely hear the person sitting next to you and it's kind of hard to order the service is good but not great the server really doesn't do any of the work it's the busser that does everything overall it's a great place to go I will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Could not have been happier with first time at this very happening joint. From Kenny the GM to Grace the convivial bartender...Service made me feel like a regular. Based on their appetizers alone I will become a regular when I am in the neiborhood. The \"must have\" menu items exceeded my expectations and will dream about the spicy shrimp. Bone in New York is my next test at next visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful birthday meal!  Attentive service.  Great food with generous portions.  Old Fashion cocktail with walnut bitters was unique and very tasty.  My only critique was that we were seated in the corner of a very back dining room in the middle of tables with small children.  We were a couple there for a birthday dinner and the restaurant was half empty?"}
{"text":"Bad experience here last evening.  Food was good, ambiance same.  However, this was a work dinner and I am in the medical sales industry.  Our guidelines are clear in that we can only spend $xxx per FDA regulations and compliance standards.  I had a table for 5 and asked the waiter (Hector) at the beginning of the evening to make certain the receipt stated that.  When the check came it said guests=4 and that it couldn't be changed.  The way they determine guest # is by entrees ordered, yet one guest ordered an appetizer as their meal. We were not told this would happen.  The math didn't work as the bill exceeded the price allowable for 4 guests.  Again, I was told by the junior manager (no GM on site and seriously this kid looked like he was 19 or 20).  He said that the system closes the check and nothing could be done.  I asked him to write a quick note on steak 44 letterhead stating the mistake.  Instead, he disappeared (for over 20 minutes - no apologies, no comp drink or dessert while we wait or coffee,  or even a refill on our water) - and when he returned there was no letter.  Instead he \"doctored\" the receipt by photocopying it then changing the 4 to a 5 BY HAND!  Then copied it again and gave it to me, while the original itemized receipt still said 4.  Thanks kid, that certainly won't get my fired.  Are you kidding me, Steak 44?  What kind of shady operation are you running here?  There are a lot of people in my industry in the Phoenix metro and I assure you they will ALL know this story.  Looks like steak 44 and all of its sister restaurants are forever crossed off the list."}
{"text":"Thanks to Dan in management and the staff working this evening (27 Feb 2016) I was able to call and have a lovely glass of Prisoner wine and a glass of Coke waiting for my friends on their wedding anniversary. They were very pleased and surprised. It's not much, it's the little things that count. My friends called me to also tell me what a lovely meal they had as well as excellent service."}
{"text":"It's been a while but man I can still taste that dern steak.  It's juicy and delicious!  I went to Steak 44 during the week, maybe Wednesday or Thursday.  It was pretty busy for a weeknight dinner.  We made reservations online earlier that day so we had no issues with being seated.  Between the three of us, we ordered 2 bottles of red wine.  I can't remember the name of it, Justin I think. We ordered 1 bottle of wine and blue cheese wedge salads, shrimp cocktail and oysters to start.  For dinner we all ordered the NY Strip Steak, ranging from Medium Rare and Medium Well.  No matter how they were cooked, they were all so delicious and cooked to perfection.  The sides are served family style so we shared Chef Watson's potatoes, roasted brussels sprouts and creamed spinach.  The Chef Watson's potatoes and roasted brussels took the prize.  We skipped dessert and opted for another bottle of wine instead.  We were all so happy and satisfied with our meals and promised each other another Steak 44 dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I'll update. The manager called and was really great to talk to. We only got the chance to briefly talk,  but looking back it's possible our issues came from something else.   Like I said in my original review... I will come here again as it's Top of Class in almost everything they do,  even their follow up."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing, from Mgr Robby making sure we had a great table, to Kailee taking incredible care of us. As always dinner here was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We are new to the Scottsdale area and in over the last month have ate out every night and find ourselves coming back to Steak 44 roughly 3 nights a week. It's absolutely amazing! The 16 ounce filet, hash-browns, seafood tower are our favorites and not yet have we had an item that was mediocre. I'm impressed with this resturant and the level of service and I highly recommend that you give it a try, you won't be disappointed... I promise!"}
{"text":"Overall it was a okay experience. Pricing was a bit high compared to comparable places & decent service. Our group ordered several different apps, sides, steaks & a dessert. Nothing was particularly very good. One thing we were not a fan of was the deviled eggs. Just not much flavor. I wouldn't advise people to not go there but I feel there are better steak house/seafood options in town..."}
{"text":"We make it a point to visit Steak 44 every time we are in Phoenix area. With all the steakhouses in Las Vegas (where I live) steak 44 is our favorite.  Let me start with their bread. It's the BEST ever! It's like a flower of pull apart buns that's baked in a skillet and is served directly from the oven to the table... it's melt in the mouth goodness of garlic and butter! Yummm The steak is cooked to perfection every time. The steak literally sizzles on your plate! My 2 boys 11 and 9 shared the 12 oz filet mignon ($52) and wiped it clean. My husband had the petit filet ($48) with blue cheese crust about $6 extra. Their chopped salad was delicious. I highly recommend their hasselback potatoes, perfectly cooked with truffle oil and a cream cheese chive dip, too good! sides are around $11  The wine selection is very good and very well priced. You can find bottles from $30 to $500 + Our server Brian was EXCELLENT. From start to finish he executed our order to perfection. My husband wanted to try 2 new wines and he was kind enough to bring a tasting for both! Both wines were excellent. He also got me a free dessert, warm caramel butter cake (yummmmm) with vanilla ice cream  (for my bday) and a special dessert crispy banana Sunday  for my boys!  Our experience at steak 44 has always been stellar, I feel now do we need to make a trip to Phoenix just to dine at steak 44!!??!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  My friend who is a local suggested that I stop in for their happy hour (seems like happy hours are a big deal in the Valley of the Sun as everyone goes to one!)  We got here early and were practically the only ones in the place on this Monday night.  So we took a seat at the bar, where we were taken excellent care of by John,bartender extrodinaire!  My martini was perfectly poured and I liked that there was a little \"dividend\" left over which quickly made it's way into my glass.  We liked the bar so much we decided to settle in and enjoy our dinner there and John made sure that our entire experience was a nice as had we been sitting at one of the tables.  While there are plenty of happy hour specials we ended up going off the dinner menu as they had soft shelled crabs which are my favorite and my friend wanted steak.  For our appetizer we had some fresh oysters which were delicious as well as one of the happy hour specials.  Our food was delicious and perfectly prepared, and everyone we met was so welcoming and inviting.  In fact, we even got a tour of the entire place by Nick, the manager, who really went out of his way to show us the open kitchen, the glassed in booths that surround it, and several large rooms that would be perfect for hosting your next special gathering.  While I don't live in the area, you can bet I have told all my friends who do, to stop in and check this place out.  The ambiance is lovely (I loved the windowed room off the bar), the staff is well trained, efficient and friendly, and the food tops it all.  Check it out!   I know I will be back the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"The food is way overpriced and it's not very good what I can say positively the service is better than the food. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Arizona hands down. Absolutely amazing. Staff is top notch. New York strip is exquisite. Ask for aqua panna water."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a special occasion at what is suppose to be a top steak house in Phoenix.  Seating took us on a tour of restaurant with many open seats and places us in the back on what was an old patio when prior restaurant.  Last table in the place across from service station.  Since it was quiet, I did not object--just wanted to have a pleasant evening.  I gladly admit the steak was very tasty and the food generally was all very good.  My complaint is with the staff.  We are seating in an areas with candles at every table except ours.  The waitress tried again and again to keep it lite--why not get a new candle?  She seemed determined to do it her way instead of just getting a new one.  Hot towels were delivered at end of meal--a nice touch if they had not been overpowering with the smell of lavender.  Not that I object to lavender smell, it was overpowering in a room when others are still eating--smells like cleaning detergent until you find out what it is.  Generally we were not happy with the service, but did not make a complaint--only do that if we plan on returning so they get it right next times.  Since not going back they can do whatever they want!"}
{"text":"Alright, where do I start....   So I called a few weeks prior to the date I wanted to make a reservation for my girlfriend and I. The woman on the phone, I believe her name was Margarita (beautiful name) asked where I would like to be seated and I asked for a booth (I have bad anxiety, booths are a plus) and she gave me more options for booths, dining room, a more private section from the restaurant or a booth next to the kitchen which she described as \"a more romantic setting\" and I'm like oh hell yea! I think she recommended that one cuz I said it was a res for two, very thoughtful.   The day of the res, they gave me a call about 5 hours prior to make sure that we were still coming in, which I thought was very awesome.   Upon arriving, the table we wanted was still occupied so they offered a different seating option, but my girlfriend and I didn't mind waiting plus I really wanted to see this special seating. It was about a 30 minute wait, but the staff were so helpful and friendly about it, keeping us updated on when it would be ready for us, which made it more bearable to wait.    When we were finally seated, the buss boy (who I assume was the buss boy, nicely dressed wearing a chefs jacket) gave us the option of a darker linen which when I asked the waitress why they offer that, it is because the white linen could leave white lint on my black pants. Bougie. Back to the buss boy, he was so funny and friendly and was right there when we needed him, when we needed water (which he offered different types to us, holy crap OPTIONS FOR WATER ARE YIU SERIOUS?!?) and when we would finish our appetizer he came and cleaned our table, I mean used a special tool to get the little pieces of food we may have dropped on the cloth table, so that was lovely. He was so funny, made us feel like home, we almost wanted him to sit down and hang with us!!! (I believe his name was Josh, but he let us call him Kevin, cuz he liked us, sorry for exposing you Kevin, I can't remember the other name!)   The waitress was soooooooo informative and sooooooo friendly, I feel the worst for not remembering her name. She gave us a run down of the menu, since it was our first time, and because we did look young, I think she made it easier for us to understand. Not condescending, just simple and to the point. Service was very quick and on point, it went by so smoothly.   There was what I believe was a manager that came over to say hello and if we needed anything we could ask, again, very friendly and you can tell that every staff members energy was lively and wonderful, the atmosphere was bouncing around like a positive vibe beach ball at an 80s concert.   The food was amazing and came quickly, we found absolutely nothing wrong with any of it. I am definitely someone who knit picks when I go out to eat, and I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart there was nothing I could find wrong with this place.   From the fresh hot bread that came to us before we ordered, to the oysters we got which were so unbelievably fresh (we got to choose whether they came from the east coast, the west coast), to the avocado king crab stack as an appetizer (I am allergic to avocado if it is too ripe, I will get blisters in my mouth, so these were perfectly ripe and fresh which was relieving) to the lobster tails my girlfriend got, and I got the scallops which my fork just melted through, with the sides to dip them in, to the side of whipped potatoes which were just like my dad used to make, to the creamy Mac and cheese which was also fantastic, and lastly the chocolate cake we got, the food was well worth the wait and the money.   The scenery was beautiful and romantic, the service made me feel like home, the food was out of this world, and to share a special anniversary with my girlfriend, there isn't a place I would have rather gone to. Go here and have a night to remember!!!   Oh also, at the end of the meal our wonderful waitress brought us warm, eucalyptus/lemon scented towels that were rolled up but given to us via special tongs was a refreshing end to the service.   I wish we could have taken that buss boy home with us, he was quite the treat. Incredibly hilarious.   Thank you Steak 44 for an incredibly memorable experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few months ago to celebrate our 6th month wedding anniversary. This upscale restaurant is located in a weird location, hidden behind AJs in what appears to be a strip mall. But my oh my when you walk in the door, it's like you're in a different world. Modern feel, dark & gloomy, nicely decorated. I loved all the different knives they have hanging on the wall directly on your right when you walk in the door.  Let's talk about food. I ordered a filet mignon & my husband ordered the 21 oz steak. My filet mignon was so tender & thick, hard not to be full of you can finish one of these. The massive steak my husband got looked like it could feed a village. We also ordered fried calamari & a few other appetizer. All were delicious.  Two drinks later and our bill was about $180, better than expected. A+ thanks Steak 44 we will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. We love going here for special events. We always have a consistent dining experience which is why we always return.   Entrees: the filet Oscar style and sea bass are amazing. My sea bass was practically butter.   Sides: Mac and cheese and potatoes are awesome.   The only negative things we've experience here are the asparagus fried. Yuck! It tasted like a corn dog with asparagus."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight for our 1 yr. wedding anniversary. We haven't had a date night in a while and I am sad to say that steak 44 was a mistake. We chose this over ocean club at city hall because of convenience and I wish we would have driven the extra 10 minutes.   Service was decent, the staff was helpful and attentive until the end. Our food came out quickly and as ordered.  ****I am giving it 2 stars because of our steaks. My husband ordered medium and I ordered medium well - we both had the petit filet. Mine was a little pink but I am over cautious so I ate most of it anyway. My husband however, was eating his steak in the low light and about halfway through we realized that it was basically raw or \"blue\" if you will. He had already eaten some of it and we were both concerned that he may develop food borne illness (picture included). We asked our server and she agreed that the steak was undercooked and whisked it away to be re done. It came back slightly more cooked, the manager walked over and asked if it was okay - no apology. We both lost our appetites and sent the food away unfinished (half finished)- our server didn't even acknowledge it. They offered us a free dessert because it was our anniversary. Then the check was dropped with no indication of trying to right the wrong. My husband called the manager over and explained that his steak was inedible and he regretted eating what he did, he stopped when he realized it was wayyy undercooked and that we would not pay for it. The manager was annoyed. He said okay and walked away and removed it. He did not apologize or attempt to remedy it at all. He kind of acted like we were cheap and we were trying to get free food. I assure you, we were not. We have no issue with paying full price for a nice meal and tipping over 20%. We do so often at other places in the valley. Needless to say we will not be back, our steaks sucked and they did not do anything to make us feel welcome back. I have a picture of the steak to prove it."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST RESTAURANT IVE EVER BEEN TOO!  I don't even know where to begin.  I am thinking of flying the four hours to phx just to go here again. The food was incredible.  The service was spot on and the atmosphere is so cool.   I cannot wait To go back Make sure to try the mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Flashy Style over Substance... It is a shame.  We have been wanting to try Steak 44 for a while, we heard great things - REALLY  great things so were excited when the opportunity presented itself to finally go.  We arrived and were greeted by Lamborghini's, Audi R8s and a few S550's.  Walking in the place is LOUD, the kind of loud that makes you yell at your party to talk and leaves you with a sore throat the next day loud.   The staff - FANTASTIC!  From the greeter/hostess to the waiters and waitresses - they were excellent, from start to finish excellent.  Professional, accommodating, friendly and very helpful.  The space - Very Vegas - not necessarily in the best way.  Some beautiful woods, high-end finishes, but Vegas nun the less.  The atmosphere - Lots, and lots of working girls - I love skin but YIKES - being gay I do not want to be someones gynecologist while dining at a fine restaurant.  \"Russian Talent\" was slurred from the table behind us.  Hot pants, tube tops and KMDFMP's are/should not be acceptable dining attire for a restaurant of this perceived quality. There were quite a few professional football players with some coaches and agents.  Lots and lots of plastic surgery - enough that any of the Real House Wives of Beverly Hills would have said \"Wow, she is WAY over done... I need to go there.\"   Food - Meh... I had an unmemorable salad, the prawns were way overcooked and rubbery.  The oysters were really nice and fresh with freshly grated horseradish and nice sauces.  Then... a horrible bone in tenderloin filet.  Supposedly this was a prime cut of beef, but it was neither prime nor tender - I really should have said something then but was so disappointed and starving I just ate it.  No salt and pepper on the steak, the baked potatoes (yes two, assuming they only got small potatoes in so had to make due) looked like they had been sitting out for a week or two and half-heartedly reheated. To be fair all of the other steaks were good to excellent.  But the lobster mash was greasy (not butter greasy) and didn't have salt and pepper.  The highlight was the butter cake with hot strawberry sauce.  Drinks - Really nice wine selection if a bit to heavy on the overrated flashy wines.   The martinis were excellent and good beer choices.  If I could rate the staff they would get 5 stars - unfortunately the food was so hit and miss that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"I chose Steak 44 for my Grandma's 80th Birthday dinner.  My boss has been here many times and has been raving about it, so when my Grandma proclaimed she wanted steak for her birthday, this was the first place that came to mind.  The Hubs and I have been to Dominick's, so we figured to expect something of that caliber and we were right.  The staff leading up to the big dinner was extremely help.  They confirmed our reservation multiple times and accommodated my request for a quiet table (past the kitchen in the back).  The set-up was perfect and we were seated right at our reservation time.  Our waiter was very patient and helpful.  He was friendly, but not overbearing and answered any and all questions our party had.  My sister and I shared the filet, the \"mashed,\" and crème brule corn.  Everything was hot, cooked to our specifications, and delish.  I especially loved the corn.  The table also shared the sautéed shrimp appetizer and potato crisps.  Both were good, as was the bread, which was served hot before the meal.  We didn't partake in dessert because we brought a cake, but the staff did cut it for us, which was super helpful and nice.  All in all, we had a great dinner at Steak 44.  My family, including my Grandma, is still raving about it.  The restaurant followed up the next day to see how everything went, which I think is a nice touch.  I look forward to going back for our next special occasion."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review, because in all fairness my first visit to the restaurant was last night and perhaps we just had bad luck. I dined with my father and my boyfriend. My father has been to Steak 44 about 4-5 times now and it had been one of his favorite steak places to go to in the Valley. Which is saying something. We also consider ourselves \"steak snobs\" as we only buy and cook prime meats and if we are going to venture out to a restaurant for a steak it is going to be top quality prime as well. All three of us ordered the bone in ribeye which is our favorite cut. My boyfriend's and mine came out as we ordered, but they were very under-seasoned. I am not a salt person, my chef brother is always complaining that i don't put enough salt in my dishes. But I actually had to ADD salt to my steak. My father chewed and spit out nearly every bite of his steak stated that there was a huge amount of sinewy gristle in his. To us, this signifies that this cut of steak is a borderline choice (not prime) cut. Which to us is completely unacceptable. To serve a steak at this caliber restaurant, the cuts of meat have to be completely prime, they shouldn't 'borderline' anything. Needless to say, he was very disappointed.   Boyfriend and I shared the soft shell crab as an appetizer. Word to soft shell crab lovers: don't get this! I saw another review thought they were terrible as well and sent them back. We didn't feel quite that way, but the crabs were soggy and again, under-seasoned. My father had the crab and avocado stack and was less than impressed.   Our waiter was disinterested at best. He showed no emotion on his face, didn't ask how our steaks were cooked until half way through eating them, and just didn't seem too thrilled to be there (this is one of those things that we could have just been unlucky with. I've seen others rave about the service). But I've been to same caliber steak houses elsewhere where the server asks everyone to cut into their meat immediately after it's served to ensure the cooking temperature is just right. That didn't happen here.   The lobster mac and cheese was very grainy. Tasted like easy mac with some chunks of lobster. I've had better.  The pros: we had a quite table towards the kitchen which was nice! We could actually hear ourselves talk. I liked that. The dessert was interesting, we shared the Cookies and Cream popcorn, and it was pretty good! I like unique desserts. Finally, the BREAD!! I could have eaten that bread only for dinner and been perfectly happy. It was by far the best thing I ate all night.   It seems to us that they're starting to cut corners (cheaper cuts of meat, grainy mac and cheese, etc). And that is how restaurants in this city die. We have an extremely high turnover rate for restaurants and the patrons know when a costly place is starting to cut corners and they will go somewhere else. I don't know if I'll be going back to Steak 44 any time soon, but I know my father won't."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight expecting the run of the mill steak house. Needless to say we were pleasantly surprised. The service was spot on as was the food. Our server was knowledgeable about the wine. My said it was hands-down the best Chilean Seabass he is ever had. I had the bone in filet and it was cooked perfectly. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Rome has less marble then the marble on top of my Steak. This place was amazing but what else can you expect from a nice upscale proper steakhouse like this. They serve you your meat PIPIN hot straight of the oven at 500 degrees. They have great appetizers as well. Oysters, Crab, (I can't remember I was kind of drunk.) were all delicious.   Ask the waiter for the drink options, they have a long list.   I got the Filet Migon and it was SO GOOD. It felt like a bubble of meat that I was lucky enough to chew into. Medium Rare was a good consistency for me."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Took my husband here for his birthday and it was perfect in every way imaginable. Ambiance is spectacular and the restaurant it very nice. Had reservations and were immediately seated. Upon seating, we were greeted right away. Service from there on out was fantastic. Each person we interacted with from the busses, food runner, and manager were friendly and helpful. Glasses were always full and table was always cleared.   The important stuff. We both ordered filets, petite for me and regular for him. Incredible and cooked perfectly! It melted practically. So good. We started with the heirloom tomato salad which they split ahead of time for us and the complimentary rolls. Sides included Dr. Watson's potatoes (basically au gratin potatoes), corn, and macaroni and cheese. All were excellent and seasoned perfectly. I was truly impressed. We finished with the vanilla caramel cake, which they decorated with a chocolate \"happy birthday.\". It was easily one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was salty, sweet, warm, cold, and gooey. So delicious!   Needless to say, he was thoroughly impressed and so was I. It's a shame we don't live in Phoenix because it would be our special occasion restaurant in a second. Everything was wonderful and we loved it!"}
{"text":"This is my second review for steak 44. We love love love it here I brought my 9 year old daughter and niece for a special dinner and RYAN made sure everything was perfect as always. We will be back like we always are"}
{"text":"I went to steak 44 Tuesday with some friends (15 of us) for a birthday dinner. I thought everything looked amazing. My only complaint is that there's too many good things on the menu to choose from! I'm on a health kick and avoiding red meat so sadly, I did not order a filet as I normally would. I ended up ordering a caesar salad which is large enough to be a dinner salad. It comes with a poached egg on top which is one of my favorite things (fried would have been awesome too). I recommend it! I also ordered two of the colossal cocktail shrimp. These things are CRAZY big, like the size of my hand and come with the most amazing horseradish I think I've ever had! It takes a lot to live up to my spiciness standards and they totally killed it. I also ordered some of the crunchy shrimp to split with my friend as an app (not part of my diet I know I know). Boy was it effing amazing! Probably the best shrimp dish I've ever had! I'll order that every time I go and it truly is crunchy. I always worry about things advertised and crunchy as I'm usually disappointed. I think it's the best thing on the menu and I didn't miss the steak at all. I also have to say the Mac and cheese looked so amazing and I was super jealous of that! All and all a great place to go for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place!!!  Great food great environment...but one employee really stood out.  When we first came in the establishment we were made to feel so welcome- Jeremy came to our table and gave us the run down of the menu- his suggestions for appetizers were delicious & he was entertaining and engaging with us.  Plan on coming back there on my birthday!!  Hope we get to see him again."}
{"text":"Pharmaceutical/Biotech/Medical Industry   Private dining room experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced! I've been to all the fancy steak places around town... We all have we have to do these programs every where. I thought I would try here,even though I did hear one bad review from a friend of mine... I really wish I would've went to capital Grille or Donavans... This was some of the worst service I've ever had. First they wanted to charge me $420 for their \"AV equipment\" They totally skimped on the side dishes... Only bringing one small vegetable one small potato per table They never offered any side dishes or deserts to my speaker??? Really? No coffee was served or offered to anyone? I had 21 guests but still was going to be eight people short... Which adds up to $1000 that I give the restaurant for no food... So I asked to wrap two meals up so it would only be $700 that I'm giving the restaurant for no food and they were total jerks about it and of course only wrapped up in one piece of steak without any of the accompanying items? For $250 I got two pieces of steak! Wow Obviously when you have a contract you pay the money but I've never had a restaurant provide such horrible service and then overcharge me for the AV When I brought this all to their attention they're like oh here's the credit for your AV... Never even commenting on the other items. What is totally ridiculous...you know if you're in the restaurant they are piling the food and drinks on...the more the better...but in the private dining room you can't even get a cup of coffee??? Because they know...they are getting $2700++ regardless. I will never book here again and I hope all my colleagues stay away as well."}
{"text":"Very loud. Matt was an excellent server. Robby came by the table to check on us; very attentive staff. Petit filet was good; a bit salty. Mac n cheese was alright, Brussels spouts were over grilled (and I love Brussels sprouts)! Chocolate chip bread pudding was amazing! Latte was terrific!"}
{"text":"Okay.  Finally have time write this review.  I have been so busy and with work and it has taken away from my yelping time.  LOL   *Disclaimer food is subjective and is based on ones likes.  Just because I like it does not mean you will.  I just had to put this in because we live in a time of warning labels.  LOL  I do not want some one suing me because I said Steak 44 is the steakhouse to end all steakhouses.  LOL  Okay time for the review.  I have eaten at a lot of steakhouses all over the United States.  Some were good and some were okay.  I think Arizona has some of the best steakhouses in the USA in my opinion.  My doctor does not like this opinion when he saw my cholesterol last year. Which has come down alot to a good level.   We went to this steakhouse for my honey bunny's birthday.  I was looking for something that was unique and we have not tried.  I remembered cork and cleaver was not there anymore and there was another steak house there now.  I made the reservation.   We got here and had to wait a few minutes.  The main entrance was loud with music.  It was different.  We were taken to our table which was a good seat because we had a window with a tree out side of it.  The server was great and was there to take drink orders.  We did not order any appetizers.  We went straight for the meal.  I ordered the filet in the largest size medium.  I ordered a side of the mushrooms, crème brule corn and the mashed potatoes for us to split.  The steak and the sides came and holy guacamole batman.  That filet was the best one I have ever had in all of my travels.  The sides were marvelous too.  They cooked that filet to perfection and it was so tender too.  I can not even describe how perfect it was.  My honey's food was excellent too.  We got a desert for her birthday and it was perfect too.    I have traveled all over the country and the steak 44 is the real deal.  I recommend you try it at least once.  It is expensive but for a special occasion why not.    This place is one of the best places I have eaten at.  We will be back for her birthday next year."}
{"text":"I can't afford to eat here because I'm Mexican, but I always walk by here and the smell of the steaks are just amazing. Sometimes when I am starving I like to come in here and ask for just a cup of water only, so that I can see the people eating their steak and like to pretend I'm them so I too can get full."}
{"text":"Our all time favorite restaurant. Ambiance, food and above all service is phenomenal. Crispy shrimp, bone in Ribeye, sea bass, scallops and creamed spinach are our go to items.....the chef will even come to your table to inquire how you liked your meal. We've often been given complimentary desserts. Well worth the price. You get what you pay for. Definitely a special occasion restaurant where you are made to feel special!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that Matt, our server was phenomenal.  Make sure to ask for him when you eat here.  He is smart, funny and professional.  I always take note of the top notch servers wherever I dine and he definitely fits in that category.  There is no doubt that he made our anniversary celebration very special.  The appetizers here are to die for and can we talk about the dessert menu?! Completely amazing!  Best dessert I have every had in my life.  The steak is grilled to perfection.  In fact, Matt made sure that our steak was exactly the way we liked it.  I give this place 5 stars, hands down!"}
{"text":"I helped in all of the original Mastro Restaurants, and this was my first time to Steak 44. I learned all my high standards from the Mastro family and I have to admit Steak 44 is their most finest yet!   Everything starting with being greeted by Frank the GM I haven't seen in almost 2 years, we were on a 15 min wait and he treated me like family and got us seated right away, we had a very nice chat, the recommendations for wine were high, seeing much of the old staff, the steaks are above the old high standard, everything was PERFECT, clean, it totally blew me away & every dime was well spent! We gave out server a 50% tip, the evening could not have been better in any way.   Thank you for such an amazing place, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place gets 3 of its 4 stars just because they have the butter cake on the menu.  Really though, it was a great experience. It was all the good stuff about Mastro's but with slightly lower prices and fewer pretentious weirdos. We came for a friend's 30th birthday and I will DEFINITELY be coming back. They actually had a few cuts of meat that aren't on Mastro's menu (and a few missing that are staples at their sister restaurant). I shared the 44oz bone-in ribeye with another girlfriend, which was the perfect portion size for the two of us. The butter on top was heavenly, as always. But the apps are really what did it for me.  My boyfriend and I started with the meatballs and the braised pork belly (hey, if pork belly is on the menu, you ALWAYS order the pork belly). Both were amazingly melt-in-your-mouth and very filling portions for two people.  With dinner, we ordered the following sides to share between a group of 6:  the mashed (4 stars) mac & cheese (5 stars) vidalia onion strings (if 6 stars existed, that's what these would be) wild mushrooms (didn't try. i hate mushrooms)  Finally, it was dessert time. Now if you've never had the butter cake from Mastro's, I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that you have not fully lived. You NEED to eat this stuff. It needs to be on your bucket list, you need to eat the whole thing by yourself, and you need to not share any with anyone no matter how much you love them. They can get their own and they will thank you for it. One bite may or may not give you diabetes, just be prepared for that.  So my boyfriend and I obviously got one of those, and we also shared the s'mores in a jar. It was deliciously mallow-y and gooey. If I had to choose between the two desserts, obviously s'mores would lose every time (sorry, s'mores), but it's definitely number 2 on the list!  Go here, eat too much, and enjoy every minute of it. Great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our anniversary dinner and both really enjoyed it.  Our server was excellent.  Very sweet.  The server's assistant was incredibly attentive as well. The service itself was very quick.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer, and it was brought out just a few minutes later, just moments after we started trying the delicious, complimentary bread.    The restaurant has an interesting layout.  It's big, but it only feels big when you're searching for the bathroom.  Otherwise there is enough space between the tables where it feels intimate enough.  The calamari and shrimp was amazing, though my wife thought there should have been more shrimp.  I thought the Ribeye had a tad too much seasoning on it, but my wife loved her Filet, and the portions were of course big enough where Steak and Eggs the morning after were exceptional.  :-)    They very sweetly bought us a dessert which was decorated with \"Happy Anniversary\" in chocolate, and I thought an excellent service touch was, in addition to the Manager stopping by the table near the end of the meal, that they called the next day to check and see how everything was.    I was deciding between giving Steak 44 4 or 5 stars, but based on the exceptional service alone, I don't think this is a place that should be missed for any special occasion.  My wife even said she liked it better than \"Mastro's.\"  That's saying something.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's not cheap, but that's because you are paying for an amazing meal. We went for our anniversary and everything from appetizer to desert was heavenly. My husband could not stop complimenting the chefs. Staff is also very attentive and helpful and helped make the night special for us."}
{"text":"100% our favorite fine dining steak house yet! We've been to a few! The food is amazing, as well as the staff and service. The wagu filet is my go to and has yet to disappoint! The bar area is high energy and then you have the dining areas where it's a little more lax and chill. The Mastros brothers knew what they were doing with this place! Hands down the best fillet I have had and my family has never had a complaint either! Keep up the fabulous service and food and we'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here on Valentine's day with my wife.    This is my third time at this restaurant, and the food here just keeps getting better and better.    I often travel to Phoenix, I have been to all of the major steak houses from Shula's(good steak, so-so the rest) , Orange Sky(good food, super nice setting at the Talking stick casino), Maestro's Ocean Club(superb for warm weather dining and live music at the bar) , Maestros City Hall (ok), Dominicks(least favorite of the local steakhouses) and the usual chains(Mortons, Ruths, Eddie V's...) THIS has been the best food experience, perhaps on par with only BLT at the camelback inn, where I had a bone-in filet that was on par with the one I had at Steak 44.  Bread is a 4/5 (most think it's a 5) Regardless, I say don't fill yourself with bread when there are so many delicious dishes...  Ceasar salad is a 5/5 (poached egg on top-which can always be removed - I loved it)  Colossol Shrimp 5+/5 (don't bother with regular shrimp or king crab, they dont compare, imho)  Wife ordered the Sea Bass, she liked it 5/5  I ordered the Bone in Filet 5+/5 (I usually always order a regular filet mignon everywhere, but this is my second time ordering the bone-in filet here, and its superb (much tastier than regular mignon with barely any extra fat..)   Dessert: popcorn ice cream sunday with chocolate 4.5/5  Very good service, especially considering it was Valentines Day/Saturday  Nice bar area.  Restaurant can be a bit segmented due to the layout.  Open kitchen, always nice to see!  Will definetly repeat!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have to say im a server and can be critical of places especially at those prices.ore waiter collin (English guy)was awsome.the food was great,personal ambiance was fantastic . originally i was going to ruth chris but steak 44 was recommended by a friend.so happy we went.the bussers were really the stars of the night.on top of everything we gave both of them an extra $20 a piece.im sure it doesn't happen often enough.thank you steak 44.we will be back"}
{"text":"What a steakhouse. It is definitely an upscale restaurant with a hip vibe. The service is amazing we had Jake and Jake. They were attentive to the details and knew the menu well. My wife and I came to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and it was well worth it. We both had the filet and they were both perfectly cooked. The crust they create on the outside of the meat is to die for. We ordered the mac and cheese and broccoli. They were both amazing. Because it was our anniversary they did bring us there signature caramel cake which was very rich and also tasty. I don't think this place will disappoint with whatever you order. The seafood looked amazing too. This is a great establishment and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I am a foodie and very picky when I go to fine dining restaurants.  This one is very special and worth returning time and time again.  The service was flawless and the food was outstanding.  Our server, Johnny, was fantastic and knew his wines.  He was very honest and recommended I NOT order the twin lobster tails (and only order one instead) because I had mentioned I was not a big eater.  The Pinot Noir he recommended was perfect with the lobster and the shrimp.  The crispy shrimp appetizer is unusual and delicious.  My husband's steak was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife.  I had lobster and it was perfect.  It was our anniversary so for dessert, they brought us a warm, butter pound cake with fresh strawberry topping and ice cream.  It was to die for.  We cannot say enough about this restaurant and highly recommend it.  But it is a lot of food and very rich; so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"How could I give this place only 2 stars???  My experience here was bittersweet...My husband and I went here for his company dinner and while the food was stellar, my purse was stolen and that ruined the experience for me.  I had my purse throughout dinner and even at the end of dinner.  But once we moved from the party room in the back to the main bar area up front to finish our drinks I don't know what happened to my purse.  Since there weren't any other customers in the party room and we were the VERY LAST customers to leave, I can only assume it was stolen by someone on staff which is really disappointing given the caliber of this restaurant.  The next day I called and spoke with a man named Dan.  After explaining what happened the night before, he said he would personally look himself.  After 2 hours he called me back and said they had searched high and low all over the restaurant and nothing had turned up.  There'd been no activity on my 2 debit cards after my purse was stolen, so I just assumed maybe it had fallen behind a chair or something...But when he said nothing had been turned in I knew it had to be an employee...They'd taken the cash out (150.00) and ditched the rest which included my drivers license....Let's be honest...The type of people who can afford to dine at Steak 44 don't need to steal a purse with 150 bucks in it.  I would expect this type of thing to happen at Applebees or TGI Friday's (no offence to those restaurants) or somewhere like that...But I guess I just expected more from a place like Steak 44.  I guess thieves are everywhere and you can never be too careful no matter how classy and upscale a place seems.  Unfortunately, no fault of Dan's or the owner, but I will not dine here again and we surely won't be having anymore company dinners here after this fiasco. With that being said, the food and wine selection was exceptional.  I had the massive crab claws, shrimp cocktail, filet with shrimp, and my hubby had the filet with truffle butter and lobster, our sides were brussel sprouts and hasselback potatoes, all very good and paired perfectly with a glass of Stags' Leap cab."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for an impromptu birthday dinner. We were seated early for our 7:15 reservation in a nice small, semi-secluded table. Our waitress was nice enough and knowledgable about the menu. I can't remember her name, but it was the brunette with fake eyelashes. Started out with the shrimp & avocado appetizer. Good, but nothing special. I order the scallop entree and a side of mushrooms. My boyfriend had the petite filet with sweet potatoes & asparagus fries. Everything except the potatoes was great! Boyfriend and I both tried to eat the potatoes but couldn't stomach them. Since we were so stuffed, we just split a raspberry sorbet as a light desert. It was good and was comped off for us, which I'm sure is their regular thing for birthdays there. All in all, it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"There is only one thing wrong with this place: I cannot afford to eat there weekly!!! It was amazing, For the last 5 years we have gone to Morton's for our birthday meals. Last year all I can say is, we were not wowed. For that kind of money, we should be delighted. Instead it seemed just ok and a little \"tired\". So we searched for a new place this year. Talk about being wowed! The monstrous shrimp priced at $7 each were so worth it. Our steaks were amazingly tender, seasoned to perfection and served on these searing hot plates. The creamed corn brulee was ridiculously good. The only thing that didn't know our socks off was the butter cake type dessert served with caramel sauce. However the chocolate brioche bread pudding more than made up for it...outstanding.   The decor is inviting...it appealed to us in that it was upscale and trendy without being pretentious. We are retired but there were lots of much younger people there. Next time we will request one of the cozy and romantic booths tucked towards the back.   This restaurant is owned by Maestro's (apparently they have sold the original Maestro's restaurants and are now branching out with this and Dominicks (which we haven't tried. All I can say is, I know where I will be come July to celebrate my birthday!"}
{"text":"Tonight my husband & I were having an early birthday celebration for him. This spot was A+ in our books! From the elegance of the restaurant, the lively & friendly ambiance to the deliciousness of the meal & allllllll the way up to the service we received. Our server Matt was fantastic!!!! Several different people introduced themselves to us from the moment we sat down. Our water was constantly refilled, the table was cleaned up in between courses & we never felt rushed. Highly suggest the petite filet mignon, sautéed corn, the Heirloom Tomato salad was splendid & the meatballs as an appetizer were unbelievable! When I made the reservation I mentioned it was my husbands birthday. Matt even brought out a complimentary dessert that was perfection! Honestly, we couldn't have chosen a better spot to celebrate my husbands 39th birthday. YELP reviews gives a perfect report on the high class experience this restaurant delivers. Well done! We will absolutely be back next trip to Phoenix! Thank you!!!! XO"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Great steaks, great service. Frank the general manager is terrific at what he does.  Looking forward to going back there very soon"}
{"text":"The Best Steak I have ever experienced! Wow! I travel a great deal for business and pleasure and spend a decent amount of time at fine restaurants. I had the pleasure of finding Steak 44 the last time I was in PHX.  This place is the Real Deal. The atmosphere and service were Exceptional and the steak was absolutely SUPERB! I can honestly say that this was one of the best meals I have ever had and certainly the best tasting steak I have ever enjoyed. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The service was exemplary.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Now we come to the food. I have never had a better steak.  Anywhere.  Period.  I had two different martinis.  Both were delicious.  We tried several different sides and all were SO good.  We had something off the menu - mashed potatoes with shrimp and crab.  Oh.  My. Gosh.  Enough said.  We wish we could ditch our children and eat here very night,  but date night only comes on Friday.  We will definitely return as much as we possibly can.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food and service are outstanding.  Great atmosphere.  It does not get much better.  Right there with the best steak houses anywhere."}
{"text":"Had one of the greatest steaks I've ever tasted. Cooked to perfection with an amazing buttery flavor. The service was amazing and we left here happy. My son and friends still talk about our experience here. It is not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in the area and happy that I received the recommendation. Plan to revisit when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"This was by far the best steak and restaurant we have ever been too! To start off this is a expensive restaurant, you get what you pay for. The bread rolls were amazing, be sure to request the butter that arrives pre-softened! My rum and coke arrives with rum on the rocks and coke on the side, so that I can make it as strong as I want.  The shrimps were huge, the steak was a filet that I ordered to be cut and cooked for even cooking. The bacon on the potato was awesome.   Be sure to order the warm vanilla caramel cake, one of the best desserts ever, no joke. We will be back"}
{"text":"This is the best steak dinner I've ever had. The warm, fresh garlic rolls, filet mignonette, snap peas, mac & cheese, drinks, and dessert were amazing. I would recommend this ambiance and dinner to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a sunday night, no need to book a reso. We were seated promptly and Travis came to greet us. He was (super cute ;]) very professional and got right down to business, extremely attentive the entire meal. We had the deep fried deviled eggs, NY strip, king crab, and mac and cheese. The deviled eggs were yummy, but very rich. The NY strip was PHENOMENAL. We got it with no fix-ins just pure beefy goodness. The king crab was pretty good. The crab was a little old though. The mac and cheese was absolutely delicious! As for drinks, I had basil limeade and kept 'em coming. The drink is actually huge and packs a whollop. Definitely try it! So, the service is excellent (ask for Travis), the NY Strip is to die for, the king crab is sub par, and I'm assuming all of the sides are delicious. One thing to note: there is a very nice wine list and extensive reserve list, definitely worth checking out). I'm looking forward to coming back. I really want to check out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went to this place and was amazed by the filet mignon that they served. It literally melted in my mouth. And the size of it - it was close to 2\" high! Boy, oh boy, I am sold! Now - your turn! Gotta try this place!  Steven"}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience all around and I can't wait to go back!  Pricey but definitely worth it.  The atmosphere & the food exceeded all of my expectations and then some.  We originally planned on going to the Ocean Club but heard great things about this place so we gave it a try and couldn't be happier that we did.  Best steak & seafood in town.  It was an awesome way to celebrate our 17 years together!"}
{"text":"The avocado stack app was good. Ordered the salmon and had it blackened. It was good. The creme brûlée corn was amazing. The ribeye had a lot of fat. I did have one of the best dirty martinis I've ever had there. The Moscow mule didn't suit my tastes."}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding service.  Save room for the smore cup dessert.  It's worth every indulgent calorie."}
{"text":"Steak 44 is my favorite steakhouse in Arizona it's a very pretty restaurant although it's a little bit noisy it's a great place to go out for a romantic dinner with family and friends they do require you to get dressed nicely and the service is always excellent the steak is delicious and their side dishes and desserts are wonderful I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a great steak"}
{"text":"Nice off the beaten path steak house.  Good wine selection.  Order an artichoke crab appetizer that looked like it came out of a box.  Taste just ok.  Ordered a filet Oscar style.  It was ok. Play nice and hot but expected.  Baked potato side was not good. It was small and hard.  This is not a good baked potato you would expect at a steakhouse.  Broccoli was so so too.  Overall first time here and won't be back.  Felt a bit rushed at first and no help with the wine choice.  Big bill for two people.  Cool ambience and I want to like it but not worth it overall.  Don't feel like I got my money's worth unfortunately."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner here!  The staff was very attentive and the food was amazing.  Try the fillet mignon and red velvet bread pudding for dessert."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last night and it in her opinion was \"The best meal I have ever had!!\"  I was very thrilled with the atmosphere, food and service!  We both had bone in filets, we shared five sides (they sell them individually and are served in their own dishes) and the corn is a must!  The desserts were equally excellent!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best steak places in the area, everything in the menu is 5 star quality food. The prices are fitting for a formal or business casual affair. Our table split the \"Wagyu\" tomahawk and it was very good for what it was, definitely good for our party of 5 and the most interesting part of the experience was the 500 degree plates that could cook your food more if you wanted. Service is very good and knowledgeable of their menu, a good wine selection and very good at displaying our options. My only reason for taking a star off is that advertising Wagyu the way they do is deceitful in my opinion. The waiter told us their Wagyu is bread in Omaha or something and that just immediately did not make sense to me as soon as he said it. I immediately knew it was just a ploy to get less informed customers to get their most expensive meat. Nevertheless, this pseudo-wagyu was still a very well marbled and flavourful steak and I would come back for special occasions for sure."}
{"text":"If I could rate them with 6 stars, I would. Best scallops on planet Earth. Steaks are consistently perfect. The bartenders know what they are doing. I eat out a lot, and I have yet to find something better."}
{"text":"It could have been 5 stars easily. OH I will be back  #1 waiter awesome.  Manager was understanding & Outstanding +++++ .  OK lets get started  Walked into a small room in the back 5 TABLES WITH A DOOR, LOOK LIKE MORE OF A PRIVATE ROOM SETTING  Wife had an outstanding shrimp cocktail, My Cesar's was good but dry, the waiter brought in extra Cesar dressing problem solved.The Bread was outstanding.  I ordered an NY Strip, Wife order a bone in Filet.  Her steak came out very rare, well they took it back and yep still rare.  They brought out another one perfectly cooked but smaller hmmm.  My NY Strip was a bit to rare but I ate most of it ate around the edges.;  Well the manager insisted on bringing me a new steak, OK great customer service BUT, it was well done and small hmmm.  Manager comped the steaks which was not necessary.  This was a cooks issue not management.  I WILL BE BACK WHY?  BECAUSE THE STEAK WAS GREAT, STEAK SAUCE WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY FABULOUS AND A GREAT MANAGER, I would prefer to eat in one of the forward rooms, I felt a bit claustrophobic in a small room, although it was beautiful and classy."}
{"text":"It's fancy.  From the valet parking to the service and food.    Two cute ladies greet us at the door and some how they knew my name.  Off to a great start.  We had reservations so we were seated right away.   We ordered fancy wine, cocktails and huge appetizers. The size the shrimp made a statement and everybody fought for them.  We had east and west coast oysters which I think is fancy! For dinner most of us selected the bone in rib eye or filet.  The bone in rib eye won.  Delish!  Warm bread butter for dessert.  Shut your mouth good.  Service was spot on.  All I can  say is fancy and worth it!"}
{"text":"We all had a great dinner!  We all ordered different entrees so that gave us a good sampling of their menu.  We started off with their salad, and that was the one thing we all thought was in need of improvement....lettuce wasn't a nice green color, dressing was rather boring.  However, moving along to the entrees, two different steaks were ordered, and both were outstanding, even though I asked that they not put \"their rub\" on my steak.  Done almost to perfection...a little more brown than I wanted but it was still juicy and downright yummy.  My husband ordered the meatloaf because he's a meatloaf fan, and gave it a total thumbs up.  The last was a salmon that was done perfectly...just slightly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, and delicious.  Veggies were fresh, crisp,  with a really nice assortment to make the perfect choice for you.  We tried their desserts...both the s'mores and the strawberry cake with ice cream were Outstanding.  If it weren't for the average salad, this would be a 5 star!  We also appreciated the lack of a noisy restaurant.  STEAK was quite busy, but still we could hear our conversation at our table, which we really noticed and appreciated."}
{"text":"Oh so good.   Quick side note, that we moved here from CLE.  I know that most people wouldn't associate CLE with great food and restaurants, but there are tons there.  It is a big foodie town.  So since moving to Scottsdale, we have been in search of a new steak place.  Steak 44 is it.  (Anyone from CLE?  Think RED the steakhouse.)  Pep talk your wallet before you come here.  It is oh so good, but oh so pricey.    We started out with the rolls in the cast iron skillet and the shrimp and calamari with dipping sauces appetizer.  I could have stopped eating there, but I didn't.   Then we moved on to steaks and sides.  My husband had the bone in strip, I had the bone in filet, and we shared the brussel sprouts and mushrooms.  Both pieces of meat were amazing. They are served on a 500 degree plate, so your food is still cooking when it comes to you. I wasn't sure that the bone-in would make a difference, but it absolutely did. I really enjoyed the mushrooms too.  Many people mention the brussel sprouts, they were good, but not the best I have ever had.  Still, not like it ruined the meal or anything.  All in all, a great experience.  We were stuffed and still had a strawberry something for dessert.  It was very yummy, but my husband and I were so full at this point, we each took two bites and waived the white flag. Our drinks were also great.  My husband had bourbon and I had a dirty martini.   Complete side note here, the bathrooms here are awesome.  You just have to go and see for yourself.  You don't get a stall, you get your own room.  It's crazy!     Last, is service.  It was fantastic!  Our waitress was knowledgeable, fun, and made our first time at Steak 44 memorable.  Love this place and hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, polite staff, outstanding service. The food is on the higher end as far as pricing goes is concerned but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Being from Texas I have a very high standard for quality cooked steaks.   I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, and man they aced it!! Cooked to perfection on the inside and out. We had the mashed potatoes that I think have lobster in them (sorry it's been over a week ago since my dinner) and they were incredible! Go here if you like a good ribeye. They won't disappoint.   The staff was great. From the moment we walked in through being seated and closing out. The manager stopped by our table and greeted us and made sure dinner was to our liking. I gave him my approval and forewarned him of my yelp review :). I think he would approve as well. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing how wonderful this restaurant is from some friends and so I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We got there and they told us it would be just a few minutes since I had reserved a quiet table. We were sat in less than 10 minutes though so that was great. Our waiter did a fantastic job going over the wine and dinner menu with us since it was our first time. We agreed on a bottle of cab and he helped us put together a seafood tower that was so delicious! The shrimp, oysters and crab were amazing. They have 2 kinds of breads and they let you get half and half; we thought both were very good. We skipped salads so our next course was the steak. Be prepared to eat the whole thing. Seriously, go hungry. I grew up in Nebraska so I've been eating steak my entire life and I know good steak. I've been to all the great steakhouses in Arizona and many other states as well. This is the best steak I've ever tasted. I had the bone in filet and my bf had ribeye. Both were exceptional! Wow. We cannot wait to go back. We also had the side dishes of corn and asparagus, both were great. We had the beignets for dessert with the different dipping sauces. These were delicious as well! The waiter brought out a birthday card for my bf as well which was a nice way to add a personal touch. Way to go Steak 44. We can wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, was our first time and the staff were awesome. Came up to Phoenix early for a flight early the next morning and had dinner here - thanks John at the bar for the great food and wine reccomendations, and happy birthday!"}
{"text":"First time here, Absolutely amazing! The food was incredible, and the service was top notch. We started with the braised pork belly and for entrees I had a filet mignon, and my husband had the Wagyu. We ordered them medium rare and mine was a little more red than I typically receive. No problem. Travis threw it back on the grill and it came back perfect. The manager even checked in, apologized, and added a free dessert. Totally was not needed, their medium rare was just a tad more rare than I was use to. Not the restaurants fault at all, but very happy with the way it was handled. For the sides we had the Mac and cheese, and crispy hasselback potatoes. Everything was amazing!! Travis our server was phenomenal, and took great care of us! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here Wednesday evening for the second time and again was wowed by the food and service. I had the petite filet and my son had the bone-in filet. Both were cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. Without a doubt the best steak I have ever eaten! We chose Chef Watson's potatoes and the roasted Brussels sprouts as our sides and both were wonderful. The potatoes have just the right amount of cheese to accompany the potatoes and not overwhelm them. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cool and relaxed, but also feels special so it's perfect for whatever you're celebrating. Special shout out to our server Jenna for her dinner wine and dessert wine suggestions. If you haven't eaten here yet, you need to. I can't wait to enjoy my next dinner at Steak 44."}
{"text":"This my #2 Steakhouse in the Country. #1 Quality Meats in NYC  Now, I know steaks. I travel everywhere and this place is top tier.    Bone-in ribeye is perfectly marbled, cooked to perfection and basically every form of the word perfect.  Seafood Tower- the shrimp were jumbo and the oysters were fresh.  You can skip the brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Had a guys night out at Steak 44 this week. It's a detail that gets overlooked but the valet team they had was great which set the experience for the rest of the night.   I had a Manhattan at the bar which felt like two drinks before we got seated. We got oysters as appetizers paired with a white wine which was awesome. These are not your run of the mill oysters and are highly recommended.   For our entree we each ended up getting New York strips, but all also got one premium cut to share which was really special. The sides were all outstanding, but the best ones came at the recommendation of our server.   I'll definitely be coming back here. The ambience is cool, the food is great, and the service team they have from valet to our servers/bartenders made this place really stand out."}
{"text":"Whenever you go to a fine dining establishment, you expect certain qualities. After all, you are paying premium prices. With that being said, Steak 44 meets the expectations. As you walk in, you are greeted by lovely hosts and hostesses. If you plan to eat in the dining room, I suggest a reservation, but we are bar people and were lucky enough to find two seats on a bustling Friday evening. The atmosphere in the bar is active and chic with beautiful lights above you and plush chairs at the bar.   The happy hour menu has several bites to share, but most of them are fried. I indulged in the shrimp cocktail which was served with three sauces, absolutely delicious. The shrimp was fresh and colossal. We also ordered the bread served in a pan. The bread had a Parmesan and garlicky taste, dipped in their homemade ranch was crazy good. My husband ordered the hassle back potatoes and a 12 oz steak and loved them both! The potatoes were crispy, but tender and were accompanied with an amazing chive butter/cream. The dessert was also amazing! It was a butter cream cake served hot with caramel and melted ice cream.   Lastly, the drinks are strong and crisp. You definitely get what you pay for.  I look forward to going back. This place is worth the money! Great atmosphere, good food and friendly service"}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting and attentive staff. My husband loves the steaks at this place, especially the rib eye and the KC Strip. I prefer the seafood, it is excellent. The oysters (and entire raw bar) are awesome as well. Save room for beignets or the butter cake, they are both delicious!   Parking, including getting to the valet, can be a bit if a gongshow."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary because we were wanting something new. It looks nice, but the set up was quite awkward. There didn't seem to be a place that we wouldn't feel crammed in a corner or eating off of our neighbor's table. I've certainly eaten at restaurants with worse set ups, so I suppose it wasn't a deal breaker. Then, the service. The waiter was constantly interrupting us while we were trying to order, and even left the table at one point while my husband was in the middle of saying what he wanted, only to come back, mutter an unintelligible excuse, and then get both of our orders wrong when she repeated them back to us. We didn't see her again until our food came out, and then again until we got our bill. As we were finishing up, a group of waiters stood a few tables from us and (loudly) complained about every table in the joint while using some very colorful and rude language. Finally, the food. Good god, the food was terrible. The salad was limp and uninspired, the green beans tasted as if they came out of a can and were unpalatable, and the steak was over-seasoned and charred. Perhaps I'm not up to date on modern steak cooking, but I don't believe a medium-rare filet is supposed to have black, burned edges. I couldn't finish it. We certainly will never be back- every single part of our experience was just bad all around."}
{"text":"best steak in AZ.  I am usually a ribeye fan but don't pass up the filet."}
{"text":"We reserved a booth after reading reviews.  I'm so glad we did. The restaurant  has a very luxurious relaxing atmosphere, beautifully decorated. Our booth was private, large and relaxing ! We  received very special  service from everyone throughout our meal.  The manager stopped by several times to check on us!  Our appetizer was the crispy shrimp, which was slightly spicy and delicious. We also had the wedge salad.   Our steaks came sizzling and perfect ! I had the Brussels sprouts and my hubby had the french fries. Very good!  Nick who was a excellent server brought us a surprise dessert, which was very nice! Since we had ordered a carmel cake dessert to go. We didn't want to miss out on it!. But both of us were too full from the wonderful meal we just had.   I  cant wait to go back for a special occasion ! For another amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":"The most amazing dining experience I have had in a long time! Five star is no joke!!! Especially the waygu beef and jumbo shrimp! You have got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Last night I brought my party of 18. So technically this review is worth more   The food was absolutely amazing. Most of my guests were steak people and enjoyed their steaks. One of our guests ordered hers M and it came out MW-W. They comped it... No questions asked and brought her out a new steak! Talk about customer service!!   I ordered a porkchop and it was awesome too! I brought a cake from an outside vendor and they were so accommodating with it. Brought it out with candles then took it back, cut it up and served it.   Job well done!"}
{"text":"As a first timer here for a friends birthday dinner, I must say that I was amazed not only by the food, but by my awesome server Josh. Starting off the drinks we ordered were great, with just the perfect amount of alcohol in our cocktails. The peach ginger and the classic Moscow mules were a great start. I went light by ordering a 12oz Ny strip and it was so tender and juicy, the au jus that was with it gave it such a great flavor! Also, the sides we ordered (shareable) were kennebec potatoes, Mac and cheese, and creamed corn. ALL WERE BANGERS. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and nice and soft inside, the Mac and cheese was creamy and the creamed corn was just outstanding. As this was a birthday celebration, the dessert was on the house as we got the beignet that were perfect, paired with a vanilla glaze, and Nutella. Now for credit where it's due, the experience here was mostly because of our server Josh. He was amazing! He created a rapport with our table and quickly became a very friendly and personable server and showed us exceptional service. I never really write about servers unless it's REALLY good. So Josh is definitely a great one! I could tell he was from Chicago from his accent and we all quickly shared experiences. This is what customer service is about, more than feeling welcome, our table bonded very well with him as he recommend his favorites on the menu and what to get. I would definitely be going back because of him. Overall this place has an outstanding menu and service.  100% CERTIFIED BANGER"}
{"text":"Always a must stop at spot when in Phx/Scottsdale. This is 100% WAY better than Mastro's city hall and only about a 6 min driving distance from each other. The staff is so much more friendly and the steak is just better in general."}
{"text":"I think I have found my new favorite restaurant! I recently dined here on 2 separate occasions during my birthday week.  I love how each section of the restaurant is set up. Each section has a different feel to it.  The bar area is a little loud so if your looking for a more intimate setting I wouldn't suggest it.   The menu is very simple which I liked. There are many different options depending on what you are in the mood for including steak, seafood, salads, and more than steak options. Ask for their dinner specials of the night that are not the menu!   I ordered their blue point oysters for an appetizer and they were the biggest oysters I have ever had! So amazing and fresh!   The first time I ate here I ordered a dinner special that included a petite filet with crab and asparagus on top with a lobster tail. Everything was perfectly cooked and extremely tasty. The second time I dined here I got the whole king crab cluster which was a pricy $65 but worth every penny.   The sides at Steak 44 are to die for! Don't pass on the corn créme bruleé, it was exquisite. I would also recommend the roasted brussels sprouts and the lobster mashed potatoes.   Save room for dessert because they have quite the selection for your taste buds. I love red velvet so I had to try the red velvet bread pudding which didn't disappoint.   The service was great both times beside a few times our waiter disappeared for long amounts of time. The staff was very knowledgable about the menu items also great with suggestions. The manager came by to check on us which I appreciated. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Steak houses ! Dan and Robbie know how to run a fine dining establishment! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We wanted a nice place for our anniversary so we pulled up Yelp & started our search. We weren't disappointed at all! My husband got the filet and I got salmon. Both were done just right and so delicious!! For sides we got the fully loaded baked potato, the Dominick potatoes and the chopped salad. All I can say is WOW! Everything was incredible! If you're in the area, don't mind spending a little money & want a good dinner, Steak 44 is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. The ambiance is vibrant, fun, energetic, and business hip.   I never thought you could beat the Mastro's bone-in filet but Steak 44 definitely did.   The wine list is great with some mighty fine options and the oysters were a great way to start the meal.   I will be back, but make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"One of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had. The service is outstanding with very polite and attentive staff that are obviously well trained to please the guests. The food is outstanding and I would definitely return when back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion...it's the coolest spot in the Valley.  Everything was double great.  Wonderful ambiance.  More than acceptable level of sound.  Food and service perfect.  A nice touch is the ability to order a smaller sized steak.   Been to all of the steak specialty spots and none compare to the evening we had tonight. Take Dominick's and make it a bit more casual...but with the same high quality food and service.  I wish I could buy stock in Steak 44...as it will be a huge success.  The meal and evening is worth whatever drive you have to make to get there. LOVED IT.  Can;t wait to return. Thanks Oliver! Larry"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last week . We were seated promptly.  There were three waiters helping us . Bread was fabulous  as usual . We had three  appetizers deviled eggs . It waa ok not outstanding  like the crispy shrimp.  . I had their ribeye   one in . It was so good.  A little fatty but so tasty. We had their beignets it was good but presentation  waa on a tree. Service  was excellent as usual.  Dress code is business  casual  .but most are dressed up"}
{"text":"Whoa! If you are looking for delicious food, an excellent atmosphere and superb service you are in the right place. Starting with the drinks, my favorite is a Lemon Drop w/Grey Goose, then on to the appetizers; Crispy Shrimp and Prime Steakhouse Meatballs you are guaranteed a mouthful of complete deliciousness. The Rib -Eye Steak is cooked to perfection. My absolute favorites are the Maryland Style Lump Crab Cakes, Roasted Brussel  Sprouts and the Alaskan King Crab/ Rock Shrimp Macoroni Cheese.   I have to mention the excellent customer service. Scott our host was very patient  and  accommodating. It was a large group of 15, all of the food arrived to the table on time, orders correct  and cooked to perfection.   . Oh by the way, we were celebrating our friend's birthdays and at the end of dinner, the two birthday guest received complimentary Birthday Desserts,  which were also delish.  I will definitely return and I recommend eating here, as a must, an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Romantic atmosphere, the food was spectacular, and this customer service was top-notch."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Spacious! Generally filled with people of the upper class (me excluded). If it's date night, get a table ...away from the bar. When the bar area gets full, there's standing room only. I cannot seem to understand the people who are complaining about the noise level when they are sitting in the BAR AREA! If you want peace and quiet, make a reservation and sit your arse in one of the dining rooms!   This place goes the extra mile to make sure patrons are catered to properly. All staff that I encountered were friendly and adorned with smiles. Gabby and Daniel made a point to introduce themselves to me. The food that I've ordered have always been presented to my liken.  Nice, unusual bathroom setup."}
{"text":"We wanted to dine here and brought friends who agreed it was great.  The only problem is there is too much food.  Two couples who frequently meet for dinner met here. Two of us started with martinis:  they were great but $19 each!  Salads were good though too large to finish.  We had wonderful steaks which some of us finished.  The leftovers will please our dog.  Sides were unnecessary so we probably shouldn't have ordered them.  Dessert was beignets which were tasty but too much.  Everything was great.  Service was wonderful  too. None of us is easily impressed but we agreed to overtip. This is a great place:  have dinner here."}
{"text":"Rarely do you find a place like this. A magical ride through flavor and savory.  Can not find a better steak house in the US.  It's that good. Quiet scene with a back table or a seat up front at the bar delivers excellent service.  A must now on my trips to PHX."}
{"text":"I expect a certain level of service at a $$$+ restaurant and Steak 44 has unfortunately missed the mark on both of our visits.   I'll start with the pros; both times my filet was cooked perfectly at medium rare and was also delicious. The mac and cheese is awesome, and the red velvet bread pudding is seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had.   Now for the not so great experiences; we first went for my husband's birthday which I had noted when I made a reservation in advance. We were sat at an awful table, it was situated where there was overflow from the bar and my chair was constantly being bumped into during our meal. Our server didn't acknowledge that it was a birthday and also forgot to serve my husband his glass of wine during our entrees and ended up bringing it out after we finished. We thought maybe it was an off night so we gave it a second shot this past week. This time around I chose the filet again which was perfectly cooked, but my husband's NY strip was overcooked and tough. We ordered cocktails with our appetizers which then sat empty for quite awhile, we then ordered a bottle of wine to hopefully enjoy with our steaks and it didn't come until we were almost finished with them. I was really wanting to enjoy the wine throughout my whole entree, not towards the end.   While the filet and mac & cheese were delicious and the red velvet bread pudding was seriously to-die-for, I can't see myself running to back to experience such mediocre service at $150+ per person."}
{"text":"Took the wife on our 22nd wedding anniversary. We had twin lobster tails and bone-in rib-eye. They waited on us like royalty. They refilled out drinks, bread and vegetables as we used them. A waiter stood by our table just out of sight. The food was amazing. We chose two glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon($12 each, very good vintage)and it went very well with our meal choices. We were given a free desert for our anniversary. It was a chocolate pudding/cake combo and it was amazing. The bill came to $247.00 and it was worth every penny. I tipped $30.00 and we thanked the staff, then we left. They also own Dominicks Steakhouse in Scottsdale. This will be our next major restaurant review. I don't know if they can top Steak 44. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner. The service was top notch and the food quality was on par with any top end restaurant in the valley. They made our night memorable and really made us feel like we celebrated the occasion in style! They cook their food to perfection and take a lot of pride in what they do!."}
{"text":"Not a better restaurant in Arizona. Food is always perfect and the service is the best you will never go thirsty or have to flag down a waiter. Sometimes we go just to eat the beignets and drink champagne. You definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. Definitely a new experience in fine dining. Their food was pretty good. The steak came served on a plate that was so hot, it continued to cook the steak. That was a first for me!"}
{"text":"This steak 44 is definitely a great place for dinner. Probably one of the best steaks i have had"}
{"text":"From the atmosphere to the staff to the food.. top notch all the way!  My steak was cooked perfectly... love that it's served on a very hot plate with clarified butter.  Sides were fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and the best steaks in town!! If you want a very lively happy hour go into the bar, if you want a quiet dining experience make sure you make reservations ahead as they are booked in advance."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meat - filet mignon or the bone-in ribeye - and dessert, side dishes are ok.  Don't go looking for a quiet atmosphere, but the food delivers an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food here is amazing. I probably had the best bone in filet of my life. It was tender, flavorful and the peppercorn truffle sauce paired with it perfectly. The experience I had is the reason for the 3 stars. We probably had the worst table in the restaurant. I was there to celebrate my birthday. The hostess knew this so I was expecting a much better table location. They sat us on the aisle across the rail from a table placed in the bar. It was like we were sharing dinner with strangers. Then when the manager came to their table to discuss their status, the conversation was so loud and annoying. He stayed there quite awhile with that couple. We literally had to wait until he left to continue our own conversation before we could hear each other.   When our  server (Megan)was taking my order, i  kept getting interrupted so someone could pass by her. Another annoying moment. Then when she took my husband's order, she asked him if we were sharing our entree. I was straight up insulted by the implication. My husband ordered the sea bass and was told, they were out. This should have been told to us when we were first given our menus.  Not after giving us ample time to decide what we wanted.  It was disappointing. He ended up picking the salmon as a last minute decision.   She also never came back to ask if we wanted a second drink. When another mgr came to clear our table my husband had to ask for another drink. When she brought his, she still didn't ask me, again, I had to ask her myself.   This experience left us feeling like our table was an afterthought. It was not the Birthday celebration I was expecting. It was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Excellent!  We yelped this place straight off the plane. When we arrived we didn't have reservations  and they took us in. What a lovely vibrant place  Awesome waiter's, services and manager that came to check on us. The \"pork belly\" was ridiculously good. Everything was great. Oysters, shrimp, salad, steak and chicken.  We had a feast and loved every minute of it. Cheers to a lovely date night spur of the moment."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this review! Our Steak 44 experience was literally off of the charts. Pricey, but worth it. I made my reservation online and mentioned that we were celebrating my fiance's new job in the notes. We had barely even gotten through the door before they said CONGRATS and welcomed us with big smiles! He was so happy!   We got there a little early so that we could partake in their Happy Hour drinks + eats in the bar before dinner. Their martinis are delicious and they give you the shaker so it really ends up being almost 2 drinks! We had their giant shrimp {pricey but oh so good!} and their king crab and avocado stack - holy YUM!   For dinner, the service was exceptional. EVERYONE in the restaurant knew our names. I literally got up to go to the restroom and slightly bumped into one of the servers {not our server} and he kindly said \"oh, i'm sorry Hailey!\". I thought to myself, how does HE know my name?! Now that is world-class, folks! Ok, ok, enough about the service -THE FOOD! We ordered an inexpensive bottle of wine to start {~$35} and then their beet salad and chopped salad; oh my goodness, the beet salad was divine. They definitely go heavy on the beets, which we love!! For dinner we split the scallops and a NY strip steak - both literally melted in our mouths. I highly recommend doing this! For sides, we had their truffle double baked potato and the shishito peppers. The potato was so rich and creamy that we each only had 1/4 of it, leaving 1/2 to take home! The peppers were incredible, with the perfect amount of kick.   THEN, since we were celebrating Ben's new job, they brought out not 1, but 2 heavenly desserts! We came home with multiple to-go bags but they made for another great dinner at home! Thank you so much for the world-class experience, Steak 44! You are our new go-to celebration spot! Whether you are looking to impress clients, celebrate something special, or just spoil yourself - Steak 44 is a must."}
{"text":"Awesome steakhouse. Great service and knowledgeable staff. If you can't decide what steak you want, staff will help and guide you. I ordered the Rib Eye medium rear and it was cool to perfection and it was seasoned right. I didn't even bother adding toppings. The aging process help to bring the flavor out.  Tender and juicy just simply great tasting steak. I have throughly enjoyed the 12oz cut with a refreshing Cucumber limeade cocktail. The warm complimentary bread was delicious and of course the side dishes Mac n cheese and asparagus fries with aioli. One of the best steakhouse I've ever dined. A great place to celebrate special occasions and to dine with family ."}
{"text":"OMG our daughter in law took us here for her birthday.  Outstanding steak, potatoes, asparagus fries and dessert.  Frantic service from Scott and his helpers.  We will be going back for another celebration certainly not you average restaurant.  Worth the drive from Maricopa to have this absolute outstanding experience like being in San Francisco! They even knew what B£B was with coffee most places do not have a clue. Save your money and treat yourself to this great wonderful place."}
{"text":"We heard this is a good place for happy hour, but we learned fast that one needs to arrive early. We secured the last two bar seats at 5:00PM on a Friday. At this time, one is able to order the small plates happy hour menu and drinks for $9.00. If we lived in France, their small plates, at a reduced price, would be a full meal. I ordered the filet and fries (Steak and Frites). Perfect! A small plate of soft, crusty rolls arrives first...  I double dare you not to eat ALL of them! My hubby ordered the wedge salad w blue cheese dressing and it looked terrific. This is a slightly upscale restaurant with a robust happy hour crowd. The food was delicious and the service first-rate. We will return to explore the regular dinner menu."}
{"text":"Ok so my first experience I wasn't pleased due to a few things so the GM contacted me and gave me a $300 gift card to come back in because the restaurant didn't exceed my expectations.  (3 total in the party) The restaurant has different sections due to desired noise and energy level which I wasn't aware of the first time attending the establishment.  We sat by the kitchen this time instead of the bar area. Our waiter was knowledgeable in all the dishes and attended us with professionalism and humor, he was great originally from Chicago. The food was great the first time as well, no complaints there. Also a thanks to the manager Seth for sending out a plate of yummy potatoes for us to sample. I heard about this place for two years and now see why people are always talking highly of it!  Enjoy guys!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner for my sales team. 10 people sitting in the backroom. Food and service were outstanding and amazingly like City Hall LOL. The shrimp appetizer were colossal. They could have had saddles. The only negative feedback is the air conditioning system was blowing directly on our table and was freezing us out. Diffuse reflection would be most effective"}
{"text":"We were a few minutes early for our 7:15 reservation. We were greeted in a friendly manner, and were seated promptly. My husband and I ordered cocktails, and chose to not order appetizers or salads to save some room for dessert. It felt like 5 minutes after our order was taken, dinner was on the table. No time to sit and relax with our drinks. The food was fine. My husband ordered the bone in filet, son ordered bone in New York and I ordered the veal chop. Sides were Brussels Sprouts, fries and Dominicks potatoes. Side were adequate in size, the fries were cold.  I don't think the experience would bring me back to Steak 44. The meal was fine, ok, but that's it. We enjoy other steak houses in town.  It just wasn't great, and I had expected great. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We dined there last week. Everything was delicious and the service was 5 stars. The shrimp cocktail was HUGE! My friend and I split 4 shrimp, the 16 oz bone in filet, and we ordered 3 sides: Brussel sprouts, mushrooms and asparagus. The Brussel sprouts and mushrooms were delicious- the asparagus left a little to be desired (they were small, kind of tasteless). The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. I will definitely return to Steak 44."}
{"text":"Service was great, seating a little crowded. Table had bone-in filet, petite filet, lobster mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese. All were good but the steaks were over-salted. Butter cake was dry  but John brought us out a red velvet dessert that was great."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when ordering and eating from Steak 44. I placed an order for over $200 and they messed up almost everything! Both steaks were so rare it looked like they weren't even cooked. They forget two things we ordered, and instead of the steak and egg gave a random raw piece of meat! Gross. The foods alright, I've had the broccoli and potatoes and I'd say it was good. But this is the second time they have completely undercooked a steak of mine, last time at the restaurant. I understand call in orders can be difficult, but for how much they charge, there really shouldn't be room for mess up, and they reviewed it with me before too! I was disappointed for my birthday pickup and wouldn't recommend picking up from Steak 44."}
{"text":"The best bone in rib eye ever tasted.  Full of fat, flavor, and charred perfectly on the outside.  Caesar salad excellent, light dressing with a pouched eggs.  Wine was expensive but top quality.  Mac and cheese tasted like cheese.  Deserts, my goodness.  The red velvet cake with cream cheese was decacant.  We ate every last bite.  Tip, the happy hour wines are not cheap, but they are the real deal, order a couple before dinner.  Service was spectacular.  This is perfect for a special occasion."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Mastros in the heart of Arcadia, Steak 44 isn't it. Although it's owned by Mastros, it's not the same experience as the original Mastros. The food was just ok and the choices were limited. Disappointed the pretzel bread - a Mastros classic - was not served. Lack of entertainment in the bar was another disappointment. Our waitress, Marina, was very attentive and helpful. Unfortunately, mid-way into our meal she announced she was being sent home as it was slow. The waitress who took over wasn't very personable, didn't offer a dessert menu (we had to ask) and we had to flag her down to get her to take our credit card. My husband and I left underwhelmed. Definitely worth the drive to the original Mastros or Dominick's Steakhouse (another Mastros owned restaurant)."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it. The food was phenomenal and the service even better. The bar is a little loud, so I recommend a reservation and sitting in the main dining room. Definitely one of the best steaks I have ever had."}
{"text":"Just an update this continues to be the best steakhouse in Phoenix metropolitan I only wish it was closer to my home"}
{"text":"Dined here tonight to celebrate my wife's 10-year work anniversary. If anyone has ever been to Ruth's Chris Steak House, that's what this place is but more of a modern vibe - and my wife and I would agree that it is not as good. The service was excellent but should be for the price. We both ordered a BLT wedge, but it wasn't too inspiring. I prefer the lettuce to be grilled or a little more crisp vs. keeping all the water absorbed into it. My wife had the filet mignon and I ordered a big, fat ribeye. They were both over-seasoned. The really hot plate is a nice touch and keeps the steak cooking but over-seasoned is over-seasoned, which unfortunately can't be removed by an extremely hot plate. For sides, we ordered brussels sprouts (overcooked) and whipped mashed potatoes (overall good). The desserts were creative and excellent. That vanilla caramel butter cake is pretty great. Because of the excellent service, I upped my star rating but food-wise, I'd give it a 3. I am going to try Mastro's to see if that is better."}
{"text":"Absolutely declicious!! My new favorite steakhouse. I'm sad that it's in Phoenix, so I'll only be able to eat here when I'm visiting. Had the bone in filet, mac & cheese and the caramel vanilla cake. Everything was cooked to perfection. The service was impeccable as well. Not a cheap meal but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Oh Em Gee this place was awesome-sauce!!! I was told about this place from a friend of mine, and finally got around to going here for dinner on October 17th. And I was given the tip to make a reservation prior to going as it gets busy on the weekends, and I'm sure glad I did!!! Even with a reservation, the wait was 15-mins or so for our table, which wasn't a big deal -- we just ended up going to the bar and grabbing a drink. (I got a peachy something -- super yummy!)  The atmosphere and ambiance at Steak 44 was great -- people were mingling, talking, laughing, etc. and everyone there seemed to be having a great time! The hostess finally came to get us and show us to our table, which was outside, and was so cute and romantic. It was the perfect temperature outside, and we really enjoyed it (except for the 10-top table that was next to ours which congregated at the end of their table, where our table was, and decided to scream-talk with each other so my friend and I could barely hear each other across the table... we were going to start texting each other so we could communicate, and laughed about it... and then scream-talked to each other to the point of losing our voices, but it was fun times!!)   First we ordered a glass of wine, and then that sizzling, bubbling, yummy, melt-in-your-mouth, oogey gooey bread in a cast iron skillet came out. Ah-may-zing!!! Let me tell you, this bread was absolutely the best bread I've ever had; we literally had to ask our server to take the bread off the table so we wouldn't eat all of it and then not have room for dinner. But wow -- I suggest starving yourself for a few days before you go so you can go crazy and eat ALL the bread you can. (My mouth is watering just remembering that bread as I write this review.)  Looking at the menu didn't take us very long to order -- we knew exactly what we wanted: filet mignon! Our server suggested the bone-in filet as he said it was more flavorful; we were sold! As our sides, we got \"The Mashed\" and sauteed wild mushrooms. The steaks came out absolutely perfect; I've never tasted a steak that was so delicious in my life!!! They were cooked to perfection and so tender that I'm pretty sure I could've cut it with a butter-knife. The Mashed were awesome and creamy as well, just the way I like my mashed. The wild mushrooms, however, eeeeh, I wasn't a fan... Sorry Steak 44. Not sure how they were prepared, but it seemed like they were fried or something to where I wasn't even tasting mushrooms necessarily, but just fried oily something. I didn't eat them... Next time I know not to order the mushrooms.   And just when we thought I couldn't possibly eat any more, our server brought out a red velvet bread pudding dessert. So sweet!!! (Probably not as sweet as the bread pudding was though; now I LOVE sweets, but it was a little much for me when we got about half-way through.) Overall, it was such a wonderful evening. Everything... the drinks, ambiance, wine, food... were spot on! I think I may have found my new favorite steakhouse, too! I will be back soon -- Can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"The steaks were delicious accompanied by awesome service (our waiter was Michael). This place whaaa recommended by a few friends so I made a reservation for my husband & i's anniversary.  Definitely a romantic place but it does get a bit loud with all the other tables so if possible you may wanna be asked to be seated or see if they have areas without large parties. Our waiter was very friendly & kind we had told him we were celebrating our anniversary and at the end he surprised us with a cake topped with gelato dessert. Also let him know I was pregnant and if he could recommmend which steak would be good well done. (Originally wanted to get the scallops but all the steak around couldn't help myself lol) my husband ordered the 32oz bone in ribeye & I had the petite filet mignon. Our sides were mushrooms, hassleback potato, & corn creme brûlée. Heads up, sides are big and meant for sharing. Just a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend to anyone. I think next time I'd see if we could request a table by the kitchen to watch. Also I received a call from them today just to say \"thank you.\" Now that's good customer service!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad. I think my issue with this spot is the cost of the meals relative to the portions they give you. Compared to other places that I have eaten, I don't think it is justified. For the prices, I expected to be blown away but I wasn't and I don't think any of my family members were either."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for my birthday dinner and had an amazing experience. We were blown away by the food, service and overall experience. We will definitely be back... and can't wait to come back. We had the king crab avocado stack for appetizer, a bottle of Meomi Pinot Noir, two steaks (filet + ribeye), cream corn, creamy Mac + cheese and baked potato... HOLY YUMMY! Each item was out of this world... especially the corn! To end the night, we had the Carmel vanilla cake for my birthday and that was delicious too. Do yourself and favor and treat yourself to an amazing meal at Steak 44!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  The mac and cheese with lobster, the lobster was plentiful and big chunks.  The New York was juicy and the Sea Bass was divine.  The Ginger Peach drink was refreshing :)  Travis, our server, was very personable.  Definitely recommend and will go back."}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday at Steak 44 last night for my birthday. The service we received was above and beyond. They seated us at a very cool booth with a full view of the kitchen, very \"chef's table,\" which we loved. Travis, our waiter, was so helpful answering our silly menu questions and wishing me a happy birthday so many times I lost count. The staff at Steak 44 helped to make me feel incredibly special on my birthday. Not to mention the amazing food. It was on par, if not above, every high end steakhouse experience we've had! Thank you Travis and Steak 44 for a memorable birthday dinner!!"}
{"text":"This place is immaculate. From the food, to the drink, to the service, and the atmosphere. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, this is definitely a place you go to celebrate things! We had the Dungeness crab cocktail, crab and shrimp Mac and cheese, filet mignon, brussel sprouts, and the creme brûlée corn. I can not say one bad thing about anything, it was all so amazing. Our server, Tom, took such wonderful care of us. It couldn't have been a better night. Cheers, steak 44! We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Ask for Gabby!!  Excellent!!! All the way around!!!  The Chablis, by William Fevre is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The Bone-in-Ribeye had to be the absolute best steak I have ever had in my life. The atmosphere was really great and the wait staff was the BEST I have come across. Please treat yourself if you're ever in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!  Great service from the valet parking attendant to our servers. When walking to are table I felt like I was VIP the greeting were genuine and with smiles. The Filet 12oz was cook to perfection and side dishes were off the chart. The Sea Bass was the best I have ever tasted.... finally the dessert was worth waiting for. I can't remember the name , but it had ice cream, cake, caramel and nuts. So if you are looking for a place to go for that special occasion try Steak 44 You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Steak 44 last night. The place is amazing with beautiful decor and ambiance. Everything was going well until our waitress came to our table. Her name was Ibti. I have over 10 years of restaurant experience and she by far was the WORST waitress I have ever had. She never cracked a smile or made us felt welcome.  It was as if we were bugging her or interrupting her day. Do she realize she works for tips?  We felt she was trying to rush us so she could get another to sit our table. So the worst part was the she forgot to bring our boxed up food so we can take home. We Spent almost $300 and for her to have a attitude and bitch face all night isn't worth it. We called back later about our to go bag but we were almost home and he said \"just tell the manager when we come again\". Really? Ibti needs to find another job that isn't in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Steak 44 has established itself among the best steakhouses in Phoenix.  The food, the service, and atmosphere are absolutely first class.  I love a great ribeye and Steak 44 serves the best - my only issue is that it's 22 ounces of meat.  Seriously!  I'm a meat lover, but even after sharing I couldn't eat half of that monster.  Perfectly cooked and presented with Bernaise sauce, it was delicious.  Another great experience at Steak 44."}
{"text":"Came her for a pharm rep dinner so wasn't able to take pictures like I would have wanted.  OMG, the steak melts in your mouth like butter and the caramel creamed corn was amazing!  Pricey place but would def. visit again for any special occasion.  Short at simple:  AMAZING FOOD, eat here!"}
{"text":"So this place goes beyond excellent food. I came here last night with 2 other coworkers.   I started my meal with the chopped salad. The amount of blue cheese and bacon was amazing! It was probably the best chopped salad I've eaten in a while.  I ordered the bone in filet (medium rare). When the steak came out, it was completely overcooked. Typically, this situation is frustrating and I end up asking to have the manager come over. Not at Steak 44. What happened next was just short of not believable. The server stopped by, I asked him if he thought my steak was medium rare. He immediately apologized and took the plate away. Not less than a minute later the manager came to the table to apologize and talk to me about my evening. About a minute later the GM stopped by to let me know my steak was being prepared and the chef would be delivering it in a minute. About a minute later, the chef brought me my steak. The customer service and class of the whole team really made me forget about an error that happens. They brought fresh new sides to the table. I ate that amazing piece of delicious meat and smiled the whole time. I was in disbelief that I didn't even have a chance to be upset. They took care of everything.   At the end of the meal, the server brought over desserts for the table (complimentary).    This place has won my business with the great food, but really the customer service. Professionals.   Btw, order the crem brûlée corn... it could have been my favorite part which is scary because the steak was in the top of the class."}
{"text":"First time at Steak 44, on the corner of Camelback and 44th St.  There was ample parking plus free valet as well.   We arrived 1/2 hour before our reservation Sunday evening but were seated right away. It was tough to tell how many diners there were because of the maze of tables. There were some tables with up close views of the kitchen, behind glass. Anyway, we were seated at a nice table for two towards the back.   We were greeted right away by our server assistant and then our server, Shawn. Due to numerous food allergies, we didn't order appetizers, so we went right to work on our drinks: wine for her, water for me. They offered four types of water, btw.   For our entrees, my wife got the Chardonnay-Seared Sea Scallops plus steamed spinach while I got the 12 oz. Bone-in Filet Mignon and Sweet Potatoes. Bread was also brought to the table. All in all it came to $135 plus tip.   All of the dishes were exceptional. The scallops were huge (3\" diameter) and the spinach had just the right amount of smoke from bacon to keep it from getting too salty.  My filet was cooked perfectly and had generous seasoning, as good steak should. It wasn't as tender as advertised but the flavor was pronounced, along with a good sear. The sweet potatoes came slow cooked and with a big dollop of marshmallow, melting in.   My wife proclaimed that her scallops were the best she'd ever had. I would agree, since she gave me two of her eight.   Steak 44 is an absolute hot spot for romantic dinner. Oh, and they brought warm cookies with the bill. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Had Christmas business dinner last night and all I can say is Simply the BEST! This place puts any steak house around to shame. Well done from start to finish."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Arizona. You seriously can't go wrong. The steaks are perfectly cooked, the raw bar, the martinis, the sides and desserts! I always get the twin lobster tail, side of mac and cheese, the spinach, the truffle fries, the blue point oysters. I come here every year for my birthday with my family and that is probably never going to change. The ambience is cool, the staff is great. I have absolutely nothing bad to say it's just amazing overall."}
{"text":"Best dinner anywhere, get the ginger peach cocktail, the creme brulee corn, and the Carmel cake for sure. All of the entrees are amazing. I'm not a steak person but have had the chicken and King crab legs, both amazing! This is our go to for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Had the NY Strip and it was cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth. My G &T was perfect. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and experience. We shared the meatloaf (amazing), lobster mac (to die for), beet salad (good, not great), loaded baked potato (cooked perfect) and brussel sprouts (made with bacon, need I say more?). The meatloaf came out room temperature but the waitress was beyond apologetic and brought a new hot plate. It was worth sending back because it was outstanding!!! And, we booked on Open Table so they called the next day to ask how our experience was! Super impressed. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the best steak house i have ever been to.  I could not believe what i was eating.  the service was incredible as well 5 stars all the way around.  I ordered the tomahawk Wagu ribeye and i can tell you it was the best steak I've ever eaten.  try the corn it was incredible and the lobster macaroni."}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me he was taking me here for my birthday. I was so excited when I read the reviews and studied the menu. Also, impressed that the restaurant has a Master Butcher. This is how the experience went... We had a reservation, but still needed to wait. I'm not sure why we had to wait because when they seated us there were plenty of seats. The booths are really close together, so if you want a romantic place don't go here. I could hear everyone's conversation next to us. And, the bar area that you have to pass to get to the dining area is really noisy. Our server and his assistant greeted us. We ordered the Rhode Island Calamari & Shrimp appetizer, bone-in filet mignon, petite filet mignon and lobster tail. For our sides we ordered, Chef Watson's potatoes, Alaskan King Crab & Rock Shrimp Mac & Cheese, and broccoli. And, I ordered the Italian Blood Orange cocktail. The appetizer was good. And, we enjoyed the mac & cheese. I was surprised the potatoes I ordered were scalloped. The flavor wasn't that great. My $16 cocktail was just OK. Nothing special for the price. Unfortunately, the star of the dinner... the filet mignon was bland and chewy. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and said the exact same thing. Filet mignon should melt in your mouth! I guess, one positive is that the lobster tail I had was good. But, definitely disappointed with the steak. Oh, and here's the best part. The couple next to us was celebrating their anniversary. We both ordered the same dessert, ultimate warm vanilla caramel cake. The kitchen staff brought both out at the same time. Our server put a candle in their dessert and placed it in front of them. I was like, that's kind of strange. Then, I could see the kitchen server tell our server that it was the wrong table. The server tried to grab the dessert, but it was too late. The husband had blown out the candle. Then, the wife said, \"Happy Birthday?\" The server apologized to them and we all had a good laugh. They took our dessert to the back. I assumed they were fixing the \"Happy Anniversary\" message. About 10 minutes later, they came back with the exact same plate! It still said, \"Happy Anniversary\" and our server placed a candle in the whip cream. I thought that was the worst customer service. I mean, how difficult would it have been to take the cake ramekin off the plate, put it on a new plate and write, \"Happy Birthday?\" I expected a better experience. I've been to a lot of steakhouses including Mastro's, Mastro's Ocean Club, Stockyards, Fleming's, Arrowhead Grill, Durant's, etc. I know a good steak and this experience was disappointing. I gave it two stars because I liked how they gave us a warm towel infused with a few drops of lavender at the end of the meal, two mini chocolate chips with the check, and other than the fiasco with the dessert, overall the service was good. All of the reviews were highly favorable, but this night was terrible. Maybe it was a bad night, but I don't intend on coming back to find out if they can have a good night. They should change their name to \"44\" and remove \"Steak.\""}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try since it opened and I was so not disappointed.  The bar was busy for drinks before dinner but bartender never let us go unnoticed behind the others. The drinks were great pours and atmosphere was wonderful.       Once seating we were taken care of like we were the only ones there!  Matt our server was Outstanding !! He was nice, funny, and just wonderful service.   I work in the customer service industry so this is very important and he hit all high marks!  Keep up the great work. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was great from the staff to the atmosphere. The diversity of patrons is also a plus. It's a good place to just have drinks or to have a sit down dinner.  I visited this place on a recent trip to Phoenix from NY.  To start we had a dozen oysters ( mix of west coast oysters) which were served with 4 sauces , all amazing.  For our meal I had the large NY strip steak.  This steak was cooked to perfection. My girlfriend decided to have the shrimp cocktail as a meal. This consisted of three colossal shrimp all very fresh. For sides we had the Brussel sprouts and lobster Mac n cheese.   All in all there is nothing to say bad about this place. The food is excellent. The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for an upscale evening while in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"IMuch like Sharon B. below, I went to Steak 44 to celebrate my birthday. We made a reservation (2 couples), it was on a Sunday. My boyfriend and I arrived early, so we sat at the table by the bar to have a drink while waiting for the rest of our party. I ordered Aviation (a popular gin drink) and was told they do not have all of the ingredients to prepare it, no big deal. I asked our waitress what brands of gin they had, (gin/vodka weren't listed in their cocktail menu) she replied with something like 'I don't know, I think we have Hendricks'. We were 2 ft away from the bar, can't turn around and ask (btw you should know this)...fine no biggy, I ordered vodka/soda. Got seated, ordered, served from the left and right (fine dining?), many distractions during dinner, interrupted our conversation to ask about food/clear table, clearing plates before we were done...  Time came for dessert, prior to coming I made sure there's a chocolate dessert on the menu. Ordered their much raved about chocolate cake and my friends ordered some caramel dessert. 5 or so minutes went by and our server returned to inform us they were out of chocolate cake. That was the frosting on the cake (or no cake), night ruined, I know 1st world problems...you know what? my birthday, my dessert choice! By this time it is 10 pm on a Sunday and no other place is open.  So here I am drinking my bitter espresso and a different waiter comes by to refill my friend's coffee, looks down at his dessert and says \"oh you should've ordered our chocolate cake, that thing is AMAZING!\" Well I would've love to order this mythical cake, but you guys are out and apparently your kitchen does a shit job at communicating wich items are 86'd.  No manager ever came by, not before or after, we paid our tab and left.  However, next day I felt like we could've went to a 100 different places in town, but we choose Steak 44 for it's superior food and service, food was good, service...well, if we went to Cheescake Factory down the street I'd understand. Steak 44 is fine dining and I do expect a bit more, \"we'll meet and exceed your expectations\"...not so much, this was more like mediocre dining, but with a fine dining price tag.  I called the next day (over 3 weeks ago), spoke to manager Jake, told him I didn't want anything for free, but I felt my dining experience was lackluster to say the least and explained why. He listened, didn't say much, said was going to check into it and call me back, I did think he'd follow up/care. He probably lost my number or is still investigating I'm sure.  2 stars as food was good, would've been 3 if I had the cake. For a $500 dinner, definitely not worth the hype."}
{"text":"We loved everything about our meal at Steak 44. The steak was cooked perfectly and it comes to the table piping hot on a 500 degree plate still sizzling. I worried at first it would overcook my meat but that of course was not the case. I also had the Brussel sprouts and they were a delightful surprise. The potatoes were cheesy and delicious. The only thing I didn't care for as much was the beet salad. I have to admit I'm someone of a snob about beet salads as I love them so much. However I found this salad did not have as much \"vinegar\" as I like it personally. It had sort of an orange flavor that I found not as appealing. I still gave the review 5 stars because my colleague liked it so it was more my preference. Also I thought the salad too large for a pre-meal dish. I wish I had tried the desserts because I heard they are truly wonderful...next time. They are pretty expensive and I was glad it was a business dinner as I would consider this a \"special occasion\" place rather than a place I would eat regularly due to the price. The entrees were $35-$40 and everything was ala carte. The service was outstanding. Our server was almost TOO attentive truthfully but he was very friendly and made some great suggestions which I always appreciate. If you're looking for a great meal this is certainly the place."}
{"text":"Steak 44 was the apogee of a majestic Saturday spent at the spa and lounging poolside. Through word of mouth and reading other rave reviews, I knew dinner would be good, but I wasn't prepared for it to send my palate to heaven.   Steak 44 was SO good, in fact, that I find it hard imagining myself eating a steak from any other restaurant! I do not exaggerate when I say their bone-in Rib-eye was the best steak I have EVER eaten. 22 ounces of pure bliss cooked medium per the Chef's recommendation so the marbling could melt into the steak. Add in some lobster mashed potatoes and baked cream spinach, and you have pure food porn.  The hostesses seemed a bit dazed, as we arrived for our 8:45pm reservation. My finely tuned F&B ears picked up some confusion in the seating arrangements, as we waited awkwardly for about 12 minutes. Something about a large party being broken down and a couple already sat at 606, the table where we were supposed to be sat. Nothing major, but then again, nothing that your customers, especially at such a nice establishment, should be hearing. But after this little setback, the food and exceptional service provided by John blew us away, and we had a wonderful evening!   If Steak 44 wasn't on your bucket list, it should be now!"}
{"text":"The steaks are amazing here! And the desserts as well. Service was great. Make a reservation tho. Place is perfect for romantic dinner with the hubby...."}
{"text":"The Dominicks of central Phoenix/Biltmore.. Amazing, expensive,classy with a great scene. Another stellar steakhouse in phoenix! The seafood and the steaks were delicious, well presented and the service was absolutely on par with the feel of the place. An awesome seafood display and a convoluted, multi room feel to give you desired privacy or a bistro feel. Bring your wallet and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"We had the calamari which came with a red sauce that tasted like the best ketchup I've ever had.  The squid was slightly overcooked though.  The salad was very yellow and wilted which was very disappointing.  I guess it passed inspection somehow?  The steak had a bit of cumin(?) on it which was different than the typical salt, butter thing.  The desert was tasty - we had the strawberry pound cake with ice cream on top."}
{"text":"I love all types of food and I am never picky. The service was not that great. The meat itself was bland and for the price it should definitely taste like something. Definitely wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Good food, good wait staff. It's a happening place...quite crowded on a Thursday night. The cattle convention was in town, and several diners wore cowboy hats. I doubt that these critics were disappointed with the beef served them. I wasn't."}
{"text":"Sizzling hot & steamy!  Love it when my food sings to me!!  The restaurant space is warm yet lively (especially in the bar area), with lovely intimate spaces if you so choose, open and airy patio with a fireplace and paned glass windows or their dining suites looking into the glass-walled kitchen.  Service was friendly yet impeccable. My server Kailee & busser Juan were on point with their timing on my food & keeping my water glass filled on this hot summer evening.  Frank & Robbie made sure I was enjoying my evening and my food was made to my specifications & was beyond delicious.   *12 oz Ribeye *pull apart bread fresh from oven *crispy shrimp (sweet thai chili peppers - garlic aioli) *roasted brussels sprouts (sea salt - crispy bacon)  *corn créme bruleé (sweet corn - cream - turbinado sugar) a.k.a. Crack Corn yessssss it's that addicting & had to have it again YUMMINESS.   Cherry Tart Pinot Noir & was treated to their very popular dessert: warm caramel nut cake. Mmmmmm thank you.   FYI:  don't look at the other guests food because you'll want to change your mind; like the lobster mac & cheese or the build your own seafood tower.  They also have vegetarian & gluten free options. Leftovers yay cause I'm soooo full."}
{"text":"Smokers greeted our evening date night to Steak 44 and they sat comfortably at the bench closest to the front door...service, including hostess, not as crisp as recalled but we still looked forward to the steak. Our seating was a cozy room adjacent to the kitchen, which is inviting until we realize there is a baby fussing at the adjacent table and now it kinda feels like an airplane...for 15 m or so. The service doesn't mention the steak toppers and we also forgot to ask. The Caeser Salad is overdressed & Steak 44 doesn't take advantage of using the runny egg yolk for dressing; crouton count is on one hand. My filet was nicely done but Beau felt the NY Strip was tough. We did manage to inquire about the donut trees spotted at another table. Not on the dessert menu, the waiter concedes they are a (top?) secret offering. A bit strange as the kitchen has the tree dishware lined up along the counter.  Overall, it kinda felt like a Sizzler evening...buy a decent steak at Safeway and grab a bottle of red."}
{"text":"I took my parents here for dinner while they were in town. Their steak here is exceptional. The steak is served to you in a sizzling plate that keeps the cut hot for the entire course of the meal. They have a great selection of cuts, non of which are too fatty or lean.   The meal starts off with fresh garlic bread in a sort of pan. The best way I can describe it is a group of buns baked in a pan with oil and garlic brushed over it. We got the calamari and the pork belly for appetizers. The calamari/shrimp combo had a great light batter that wasn't heavy but maintained a terrific crisp. The pork belly was a little on the sweet side for me because of the sweet chili they drizzled over it. I'd recommend asking to forego it.   I ordered a KC bone-in cut with foie gras while my parents got a bone-in ribeye and a meatloaf. The steaks were all phenomenal. I would say the foie gras wasn't worth the extra 18 dollars so would recommend using your money to get an extra side or something. My parents complained that the meatloaf had a very sweet barbecue sauce brushed over it that really detracted from the heartiness of the meatloaf. If you're into barbecue sauce go for it I guess. Sides are done a la carte here. We got the mushrooms and the Brussels sprouts both really good. We finished off the meal with some sorbet that was just sweet enough to satisfy without making you feel like getting a headache later.  I would definitely recommend coming here for a nice dinner and excellent steak!"}
{"text":"Was first seated in the bar area.  It was extremely loud and couldn't hold a decent conversation without yelling.  Brought it to the attention of the hostess and she happily relocated me to another section of the restaurant.  From that moment on, it was pure bliss. I thoroughly enjoyed my 22oz rib eye, corn creme brulee and broccoli sauteed in garlic.  The service is impeccable.  They offered me free dessert to compensate for having to relocate me.  The restaurant even contacted me the next morning to inquire about my experience.  5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Brought a date here after hearing all of the great reviews but the meal seemed way too small, and the shirt rib tasted dry & over cooked. For the price I'd recommend Mastros or Donovans. the complimentary butter cake however was outstanding."}
{"text":"I love Steak 44! We recently went for happy hour which provides a fabulous atmosphere and great service. Happy hour is from 4 to 6 PM Monday through Friday and has a variety of options to choose from. If you stay for dinner, of course the steaks are fantastic. There are also some great seafood options and the desserts are delicious. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING!! I live in Scottsdale and have not been here since it was \"Cork N' Cleaver\" I've been to all the \"better\" steak restaurants in Scottsdale and Steak 44 is by far the BEST!! Everyone and I mean everyone from the valets, to the hostess, to the waitstaff and servers are THE BEST!! From the appetizers to the main course to the deserts was spectacular!! I would DEFINITELY come here and HIGHLY RECOMMEND whoever is reading my review come here!! I will be back many many more times!! Thank you Steak 44 for showing all of Phoenix HOW a TOP NOTCH restaurant is supposed to be!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Scottsdale and were recommended to try this restaurant. I must say the highlight of this restaurant was the sizzling filet minion. Cooked to perfection- medium rare with crispy on the outside-just like we ordered. The plates  come extremely hot so as the steak is sizzling as it is set on the table. Delicious! However, that was it. The service was poor, the sides were mediocre. And the atmosphere was lackluster. If your in the mood for a juicy steak, this is a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Our favorite place. We moved to Arizona from Long Island, we are a huge stake fan.. use to go to the amazing peter Luger and honestly never thought we will find a competition. I am happy to say that stake 44 is wonderful like peter Luger and sometimes even more! Great service, amazing energy."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The food, the service, the experience. If you haven't been, treat yourself."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner here a few days ago and the food was delicious. I enjoyed the bone in filet, cooked to perfection, and my mouth is still watering. We started with the oysters. I HATE oysters but I was convinced to try one and low and behold, it was great.  They are served raw on the half shell like every other place but at Steak 44 they come out with a variety of sauces to enhance your oyster experience. I am still shocked that I liked them. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes and all I can say is wow. Absolutely spectacular. Can't recommend this place enough. Pricey but WAY worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always great and they are very accommodating. Had the lobster my first visit here and loved it! The scallops are almost another of my favorite! And you can never leave without having the butter cake!"}
{"text":"Steak 44 is the most amazing steak restaurant it has a hip and cool vibe.  Every time we go there we are treated so well.  This time the GM gave my date and I comped desserts for our consistent business.  We will back back at least 3-4 times a month.  The Filet Wagyu 12oz was absolutely amazing & my date had the Steak Farina we will always try new things, but this was absolutely exceptional!!!  Let's not forget the dessert menu omg so so yummie!   Thank you guys!  -Anthony Vigil @hairbyanthony"}
{"text":"Traveled from out of town. Heard terrific things about steak 44 and it was above and beyond.  Perfect steaks - \"better than peter lugers\" said a colleague. Waitstaff incredibly professional. Decor-ambiance perfect.  Restaurant manager runs the place with perfection and class. Terrific experience"}
{"text":"Always have a nice meal and good service here! Oysters are good sized, which is nice to see. One of the few places in the valley that does a dry aged steak. Solid wine selection; including some Oregon and Washington reds. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a great \"special occasion\" splurge. Yes it is expensive but the staff and the food make it all worthwhile. Don't go just for the food, go for the attention to detail that makes 'eating out' completely different from 'dining out'. The bar was mobbed and looked fun. But we wanted a quieter dinner to celebrate and we were seated in a small space with only 2 other tables. That was totally our speed. My advice is to talk to them when you make your reservations and seek out the vibe you want. In the bar is lively and loud, in some of the other spaces, quieter. Some better for romance and some better for business clients."}
{"text":"Top notch all around.  Great atmosphere, great service, great food.  The service and food is almost the same as you would find at Mastro's; just in a more casual atmosphere.  The price is almost the same though.  My only complaint is that the sides are too small.  I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Went here last january for our 3rd yr anniversary, we came earlier than our reservation time but got seated right a way. The staffs were all very courteous & attentive. I love how we were tabled in a more quiet room & we get a view of the kitchen on the way. The food was all great! Pricey but totally worth the experience. Really nothing bad to say about this restaurant. 5star experience at its finest."}
{"text":"A great place for date night or any special occasion.  My wife and I, were celebrating our anniversary and our dinner was truly magical.  Started with the wedge salad.  Wife had the sea bass and I, the 12oz filet perfect temperature.  We shared the Brussels sprouts and asparagus fries, yes asparagus fries!  Get Them!  Finished the night with a butter cake dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and easily the best ribeye I've ever had in my life. Haven't come close to replicating this experience anywhere else I've been."}
{"text":"Easy booking and accommodating.  Service was great, all the sides were delicious.  Beets salad is refreshing. I thought steak was over charred on the outside but still tasted very good perfectly cooked to medium. Recommended if you have good cravings for steak. I liked it here better than Dominic's as the music wasn't as loud, you can actually have conversation. Food pretty much tastes the same; delicious. Good dessert menu too."}
{"text":"This was truly a pleasant surprise.  So much better than Dominick's.   All the food was excellent.  They have this figured out.  Bone in filet is the real deal."}
{"text":"Really good dinner selection, started off with the calamari and shrimp starter and also ordered the New York Strip Steak with a side of asparagus fries and asparagus potatoes and it was super good! The steak inside was cooked good only thing the outside I didn't expect to have the charcoal flavor so like the burnt taste but they told me it was part of the tub which was different for me. I ordered the pomegranate Martini and my girlfriend ordered the strawberry drink which was both really good!  The restaurant was really nice and enjoyed our anniversary dinner. We finished off with caramel cake with ice cream on top and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and attention to detail. I had the NY strip, it;s tenderness and flavor was off the chart. Sides were french fries, (I know), and a sweet corn brulee which was like it sounds. Sweet and crunchy."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start. From the minute we  walked in, until the minute we left... PERFECTION. Greeted very warmly, we told the host we had a reservation. As they prepared our table, the host was communicating with Mariol about the restaurant. When seated, the server  assistant (forgot his name unfortunately) Gave is our options for different types of water, was very professional, and friendly. Our server, Scott, was such an out of the park, elegant as well as approachable, funny, and just all around outstanding server. He answered every single question we had, about wine, the menu, even down to the farm the Wagyu beef is from. He gave us recommendations, and ensured we got the most of our experience. We ordered a bottle of wine, and when we did our cheers for our anniversary we were celebrating, Scott discreetly paid attention, and when we finished our meal, said he overheard us discussing our anniversary, and insisted we got dessert, on the house! What a great guy. Would definitely recommend requesting him, this was our first time in to Steak 44, and we will be sure to return after the overall experience that we received.  For dinner we Started off with the Rhode Island calamari and shrimp combo, which was absolutely delicious. Probably my favorite calamari I have ever had. I got a 8oz filet mignon, and my boyfriend ordered the 16 oz New York Strip, both requested medium rare. Cooked exactly to temperature, red throughout with a cool red center. Belicimo! For a side, we split the Corn Brulé... DO NOT MISS THIS YOU MUST ORDER IT!!! Imagine a sweet corn, with cream, caramelized. How could you not be curious? Let your curiosity enhance your experience! This was so good!!!  For our complimentary dessert, we opted for the off the menu special, a chocolate torte with a raspberry sauce and an almond crust of some sort. Wish I remembered the exact description, but just like the rest of our meal, it was perfect.  All in all, this was the perfect way to end our anniversary, thanks Steak 44 for the wonderful experience. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Steak 44 has outstanding steaks and sides. My husband and I went to celebrate our son's birthday together with our children on a Friday evening. We had made reservations and our party was seated at that time. We started our meal with the appetizer of the giant prawns. Fresh and delicious shrimp served with a homemade tartar sauce that had a very pleasant and tasty kick to it. Each one of us ordered a different steak from the ribeye to the filets. We ordered our steaks from rare to medium well. Steak 44 does cooked there meat to perfection. No steak sauce needed, the meat was very flavorful.  We decided to share some of the sides and not one of us were disappointed. The brussel sprouts,  chefs potato ( which is their scalloped potato ) and the lobster mac and cheese were wonderfully pre paired. We all agreed our favorite palate pleasing event was when we tasted their out of this world cream corn dish. Although the corn was meant to be savoury it was almost like a yummy dessert. We ended our meal with a tree of beignets served along with three different yummy dips. This was my third time eating at Steak 44. I've enjoyed each and every time I have ate at this restaurant. Well done steak 44."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this steak house. Not a good value however we had a very nice waitress. The way the tables are arranged in this small, dark restaurant does not give you much privacy. Expensive, yet it was tasty. Very surprised that butter was not served with their warm bread."}
{"text":"The meatballs are fantastic! Coming from Chicago these are pretty spot on to the real deal from home. The wine pours and staff are so accommodating and personable. This restaurant doesn't need a positive recommendation because it's one of the best in AZ. You will never have a bad meal! Highly recommend the Phoenix or Chicago location, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmy.  Pricey, but a really good experience!  My group shared the sides and also tried each other's main dishes.  All of the food was amazing.  The wine list and beer selection was very good and we liked that they use local vendors (such as Phoenix Ale Brewery).   Desserts, ssoooo gooooood.  Service was attentive.  Reservations required."}
{"text":"We ate here late at night about an hour before closing.  Ordered the filet mignon, lobster mac & cheese, Brussels sprouts, and creamed spinach.  The filet was ok.  Not as juicy and tender as you can get from Fleming's for the same price.  The lobster mac & cheese was not very cheesy and lacked flavor.  The Brussels sprouts were good.  The creamed spinach tasted like frozen spinach.  The rolls served before the meal were amazing though! The waitress was really over-bearing and pushy.  She kept trying to sell things to us and wouldn't take no for an answer.  Her and every other waiter that passed by wanted to \"serve us our sides.\"  I don't understand why it is necessary to have them scoop our food onto our plate for us, and when we say no, they look at us as if we are weird.  I don't want people touching my food and spoon feeding me as if I'm a child.  On top of all of this, there was only one other table in the restaurant, and that table was so loud and drunk, we couldn't even talk at our table.  It was absolutely a terrible experience!  I feel like this restaurant is supposed to be a romantic restaurant with the dim lighting, white tablecloths, and upscale decor, but it was more like a bar with the loud clientele and music.  For the price, I'd much rather eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Spent our first married Valentines at Steak 44. This is one of our favorite places for special occasions. We also always ask for a booth in the back by the kitchen- and by chance we typically get Nicholas. We haven't had many other servers there, but I am confident to say that he's got to be one of their best. We ate the colossal shrimp cocktail, rack of lamb, and King crab with drawn butter. For sides we got the mushrooms, corn brûlée (one of my all time favorite things) and fries. Everything was delicious although I probably wouldn't get the fries again. Cocktails were fabulous - boozy but you could still taste all the flavors intended. We are never disappointed and will be back shortly for my husbands birthday! Thanks Steak 44 for the memories."}
{"text":"Wow - such a great place!  We came in Saturday night for dinner and had a great experience.  The atmosphere is great - love the lighting and decor, the service is so professional and the food was fantastic.  I enjoyed the wedge salad, a delmonico steak, the mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts.  I only wish I had left room to indulge in a red velvet bread pudding...next time for sure!"}
{"text":"When my friend invited me to Steak 44 he was expecting a big f-u because I'm Vegan. But I'm also down for some fine dining, ya know ;) I never had been!!   We rolled in around 7 and found two spots at the bar. I love their bar menu- it lays flat so you can share between people and  offers a 'ehhuuge!' Wine selection. We cracked a bottle of their Nozzole 12' from Chianti and it was sooo delicious!  The bartender, (ladies, he was some sort of handsome line-backer) was super gracious and had all the service points I would go back just to have him service me again! Lol but really, in all professional sense, we never had to touch the bottle he always kept our glasses full. Great timing, great suggestions for me and he made an extra effort to make sure that my order came out perfect. He was awesome!  My vegan meal- he suggested 3 steamed veggies over pasta, and a side of French fries (yeah!)  and moreover it was evident that he was making sure that me Joe had the comfort to relax and catch up after almost a year!  Great energy! The bar was full the entire night-nice spot people watching! Seemed like people there were on a different level- relaxed and super social, more swanky then not! I can't remember the music thinking back- but that's because it was lost in my sensory with an overload of the good food,conversation,laughs, wine and people. Thanks Steak 44 I couldn't have asked for more.  Ps their smores dessert (layered chocolate/gram/custard)was sooo good! Joe had the lions share but I had most of the marshmallow topping on top. They also torch it right in front of you."}
{"text":"Okay Fir those of you that have visited Steak 44 and Mastro's, who's #1? Wow! I have to say Steak44 has an awesome bone in 22oz ribeye and I'm torn right now on who my go to spot will be for the bomb steak. I would say the butter cake at mastro's is better than the warm cake at 44. My wife and I celebrated our 26 anniversary at 44 and the place did not disappoint, the wait staff was friendly and made sure you were well taken care of. We ordered the cream spinach which also had chunks of Brussel  sprouts and garlic. We also ordered the corn and crusted potatoes. As you can tell from the photos the crab legs were huge and well worth it. Of the chain !!!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.. My sister took me to 44 for my B day and she knows I am a lover of steak. No one loves the cow like I do! Best steak I've had so far in the valley! Please know I am from Chicago. Service was awesome, thank you Charles for the great service you provided. Explained the menu and steak preparation. Again appreciate the awesome service. You deserve a promotion! I can't say enough about the steak, everyone needs to check this place. The environment was sexy! Low dim lights, table cloth tables, music a bit to high. Casual dress code. Bar area was packed, had a nice drink waiting for our table. Charles thank U for the special b day dessert. Anyone in the valley who loves the cow, this is the place!!!"}
{"text":"Worth the hype! We are devoted dominicks guests and were very pleased with our experience. We went for my birthday, and we were very particular about our table. They accommodated every request and the general manager even came by the table. Our server was delightful. The bread was delicious to start the meal. We ordered a bottle of amarone - great value! Then onto the seafood tower - what a treat! Our steaks were all cooked perfectly. Be careful because they keep cooking on their steaming hot plates. The vanilla Carmel car dessert is a must. Don't pass it up. Try to sit in the bar for a convivial crowd."}
{"text":"This place never fails me. The first time I tried it was for me and my husband's anniversary. This is our new favorite restaurant. Any other steakhouses we have been too have never compared. From the service to the food everything was spectacular. The fried deviled eggs are sent from heaven. I recommend this place to anyone that comes in from out of town. Steak 44 is a MUST:)"}
{"text":"It was our first time here to celebrate our 26th wedding anniversary.  Great food, drinks and service.  Not an everyday kind of restaurant for us but to celebrate a special event or for an occasional splurge dinner,  this is the place to go!  The bone in rib-eye was cooked to perfection and the sea bass and scallop special was the best seafood we have had in years.   They even gave us a complimentary dessert to help us celebrate."}
{"text":"Great food and great service for what you would expect from this great steak house City Hall family. It's pricey but that is expected from a great steakhouse. Their seafood is the freshest in town."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The food, the service the drinks! Going on New Years eve can't wait!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant with consistently great service and always delicious food. The seafood towers are awe-inspiring and the steaks, my goodness, the meat at this place makes you want to read the bible. Some of the appetizers and sides are innovative and unique, like the Fried Deviled Eggs and Corn Créme Brûlée, but the place still has the wonderful steakhouse standbys like Creamed Spinach and Loaded Baked Potatoes. Pricey, yes, but truly worth every cent. The staff is incredibly well trained, friendly and (seem to) genuinely like what they do. Oh, and the bar is beautiful with a bright, lively atmosphere with top-notch bartenders (love the craft cocktails)."}
{"text":"Very pricey, but amazing quality food and service. Great wine and food, good for celebrating a special occasion"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  My wife and I went in on our anniversary and had a fantastic time.  We wanted to sit at the bar, but it was crazy packed...on a Wednesday mind you at 8.  Wow.  Impressive.  Regardless, we were seated in a great booth and the waitress did a fantastic job allowing us to enjoy a pre-meal cocktail prior to ordering.  Everything was coursed perfectly.  Wonderful experience and worth every penny."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pleasant. The service amazing.  The Filet was 5 stars and the ribeye was 4 stars. The price was reasonable. And oh was it clean. Definitely a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse and definitely worth trying. Was out in Arizona for work and heard nothing but great things about Steak 44. Ordered the filet mignon , lobster Mac n cheese and corn creme brûlée everything was delicious. My only downside of this place would have to be the waiter. He was very irritable and a bit condescending but all in all the food was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We definitely love coming here! We come about once or twice a year though. We had the bone in filet, creamed spinach & Mac & cheese. Couple of cocktails - Moscow mule & Pinot noir for me. Our food was great! And when they say that the medium is a little raw in the center they mean it! But I'm okay with it so no complaints because the plate was so damn hot that all I had to do was cut a piece lay it back on the plate and it'll cook the piece to well done lol I'll have to say the only thing I didn't care for was the mac & cheese and mostly because the plate was so hot that it kind of cooked it more and it turned oily rather than stay creamy. The service was great and it was noticeable that it was a well oiled machine haha so good job to everyone! We were in & out within 40 minutes. Guess it helped that we knew what we were ordering before we got there.  Oh and just one thing that I'd like to see is the Bravo feature to tip the valet guys"}
{"text":"I've hit most of the steak places (Maestro, Ruth Chris, Mortons, etc), this is my favorite steak place.  First of all, they started you off with a skillet of fresh bread.  Mouth watering bread.  So warm, soft and seasoned perfectly.  Second, we always have the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp are the size of a small lobster.  They are huge and delicious.  My hubby always get the 12oz filet which is tender and juicy.  Since it was my baday, this time, I got the lobster and 8oz bone in filet.  The bone in filet is a little more tender but def a little more work to get the meat off the bone.  Both are excellent.  All the sides are good too.  We love the lobster mac and cheese.  The corn creme brulee is good too.  I love the sweet potato with marshmallow cream, my hubby hates sweet potato and thought it was pretty good.  As for the dessert, my favorite is the brown butter cake and my hubby like the cookies and cream sundae.  I've tried the red velvet bread pudding, it was good but got a little too sweet after several bites (good thing to share for 2 or more people)."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse, awesome service. Free valet, single private restrooms, and bottle service. The NY strip with crunchy shrimp and creme brulee is where it's at. The beignets were off the hook yummy. Go here, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Great filet, perfectly cooked.  Went all in on the lobster truffle topper. Started with the calimari, ended with the ultimate caramel dessert...fantastic."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I'm not a big steak person - at all. However, this is the only steak house I will order steak at because it is oh so delicious! I'm also a pretty major bread critic, considering my major love of carbs. This bread beats any I've ever had. You may think this is silly to point out but it is seriously to die for! Served in a cast iron skillet, the buttery roles taste just so slightly underdone, melting in your mouth with every bite.   The appetizers and sides are good, but not necessarily worth mentioning after you've tried their chocolate peanut butter milkshake. I'm not a huge dessert person but I'm a sucker for peanut butter. It has the perfect balance of sweetness with chunks of peanut butter mixed in. You just have to try it!   The only downside to this restaurant is their service. I've always had to wait, no matter if the restaurant is crowded or not. When I dined there this past weekend, we were there for a birthday party. The reservation had been made about a month in advance for 8pm. When we arrived at 7:30pm, we grabbed a drink at the bar. What we thought would be a 30 minute wait for them to get our reservation ready, turned into an hour and 15 minutes. We were not seated until 8:45pm. No one even acknowledged the fact we were seated 45 minutes past the time of our reservation or thanked us for our patience until my outspoken friend said something to the GM. His response was that they were busy and couldn't control when other tables would be done eating - so really there's no point of even making a reservation. The service the rest of the night was decent, at best, as the waitress wasn't the most attentive.   Once they improve on their customer service, I will be a very satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional, from the decor to the food it is definitely an experience. I must say that I was extremely loyal to Mastro's City Hall before I started coming to Steak 44. This place is basically the same in terms of quality of food and service, the difference is the ambiance. At Mastro's you feel like you're in a stuffy old money ultra high-end steakhouse. Steak 44 is fun, vibrant and lighted! Lol.  My favorite is the Wagyu NY, I've also gotten the Kansas City and the Tomahawk. Their sides are insane, I recommend them all. The appetizers are also absolutely nuts too!  One thing you have to get is the beignet tree. These beignets may be the best beignets you can get outside of New Orleans. They're a great compliment to a heavy meal. Steak 44 fits Arcadia perfectly and it's also a great experience when I go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the most amazing anniversary dinner!!! You can't go wrong with steak. And the Brussel sprouts was a side that I would definitely order again. Great food, fantastic service! We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Consistency is whay you expect with a high end restaurant, and their quality never falls short. Staff is knowledgeable and pleasant, we have never once had a mistake with so much as a drink, and we've been here to dine a dozen times. My go-to is always the Petite Filet, medium rare, with sides of mushrooms, corn creme brulee, creamy Mac n cheese, and we always start with the pork belly, deviled eggs, and beet salad. Desserts are always pleasant, the beignet tree is a sight to see, and delicious!"}
{"text":"The best steak I've had in Phoenix, period. Yes, it is pricey, very pricey, but it is worth it. The quality of food here is outstanding. Service was excellent as well. Will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Off the charts! The service was fantastic, the food did not disappoint. The decor is intimate and cool. This place blew us all away, and we are hard people to impress. We got in the car and I said to our group \"Now that is what going out to dinner SHOULD be like.\" This restaurant goes above and beyond to make sure they deliver the goods. It's a dining experience not to missed."}
{"text":"The food at Steak 44 is always delicious and the service is impeccable.  My boyfriend and I live across town but love to visit Steak 44 for more than just a special occasion!  I had my 40th birthday party here as well at the end of June.  The staff was more than accommodating to our large group and everyone had a wonderful time.  We will be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic for Phoenix.   Very good local restaurant.  It is not Delmonico's but what is...    Very good though."}
{"text":"The waitress is super nice, appetizer is really good but the steak is way too salty. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"First, do not leave until you've tried the fried banana split! SO good. Now that we've got that out of the way. The steak is good as you can expect from such a place. Comparable to Mastros, Dominick's and the like around the valley. The Jumbo prawns were awesome and worth the $8 a piece. Atmosphere is nice and romantic as expected from a higher end steak place. Service and food is good so definitely a decent place to visit if you're into steak and seafood. I'd choose this place over all the other ones just for that fried banana split."}
{"text":"This is our go-to steakhouse for special occasions. Perfect meal again last night ...2 filets cooked perfectly as well as the sides. Attentive service and a tasty anniversary dessert. Excellent meal once again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Best steak I have had in Arizona. My lovely wife and I were hosting an out of town friend who loves amazing food. We had been waiting for an opportunity to show off steak 44. We were all so impressed by our wonderful dinner.   We stared with the crispy shrimp. A touch of heat, crispy, tender shrimp with a sweet glaze. So good.   Their bread is super yummy. Soft, with crispy exterior with a nice yeast flavor.   We all had steak and shared our sides. Each steak was cooked to perfection.   My wife and I had NY strip. Perfectly cooked at med rare. Just melt in your mouth goodness with super beef flavor you don't get with a filet.   Our friend got the wagyu which he was very impressed with. He said it was as good or better then most steaks he's ever had.  We shared sweet corn, Creme Brulee corn, Hasselback potatoes, mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms. Wow all were so good.   We don't drink, but I know they have one of the best wine selections in the valley.   Service was world class. Not one mistake was made. The bathrooms were spotless. Wow what a great time. I really can't wait to come back.   Service 5/5. Food 5/5."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing, music is loud but we didn't mind. We had reservations in the bar which was nice. I ordered the basil limeade and it was delicious. It was a little high when I saw the price but it was huge so that was ok, I only needed one. The food was good, my family and I had steaks and crab legs which mom loved. The portions are small but I think that's why they load you up on that yummy garlic bread before your meal comes. The reason I decided to give only 3 stars is it's really over priced. The \"servers assistant\" is simply a ridiculous concept. The server, and the assistant began to clear all plates before mom was even done eating. I thought it was really rude. I'm not sure I'll be back.... but it was an experience to say the least."}
{"text":"First, I think the rating should be four dollar signs, not three.  If you want quiet, elegant, calm, attentive service in your wait staff, you will not find it here.  Our waiter spoke as though he had had thee shots of espresso as well as a line of coke. We had no idea what he said it was so rote. Then,  we were bombarded by three men at once, one asking if we wanted black or white napkins (I assume to match our  outfits), another asking if we wanted water and there were three dif. kinds, and the third, our waiter, giving us three menus, one wine, one cocktails, one wine and food. These menus were big enough to sit on the floor and lean against the wall because there was no room on the table. Ok, a somewhat over energenic staff, and I think the reason is the  medium heighth man in a suit, standing in the doorway, watching over the room and talking into his wrist to his staff, was constantly giving them orders.  So my friend got the wrong drink...so simple, a vodka and tonic, cum, soda instead...three men jumped to correct his order after the man in the suit spoke into his wrist. In the meantime, a very tall man in a dark suit came to the doorway to oversee things. Honestly, the only word that came  to my mind was Mafia, really. The staff was laboring under several watchful eyes.  As to our dinners, the steaks, ok but not worth the high price...the crab avocado stack good but too much (soy?). The tempura  asperagus dense and oily, the 12 0z  NY Strip I could get at Fry's.....the desert...outstanding.  For me, going to dinner with friends is a sharing and intimate esperience in both conversation and food and should be a pleasurable and relaxing... like an extension of my own dining room, and it seemed that the costs on the menu implied this was the kind of experience one would get; but, that was not the case at all. It was as though Steak 44 aspired to be THAT kind of restaurant but falls really short."}
{"text":"Really liked this place!! Great Dirty Martini, perfect meatloaf and the Corn Creme brûlée was to die for!! I will definitely be back and hopefully be able to save room for dessert!! Went on a weekend night and it was busy and loud... I'll probably go back during the week next time."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary and everyone was so sweet and congratulated us all night. We tried the fried deviled eggs, filet mignon, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and crispy banana split. The deviled eggs weren't our favorite (but they comped them for us!!) but everything else was so good!! I will be returning as soon as we have another celebration. We saw a few of the desserts and they all looked amazing. The staff was polite and efficient. A truly pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"If I could give it more stars I would. I come here often for their amazing happy hour with my boyfriend, the food is amazing and the drink prices are very reasonable for the location and atmosphere!  Tonight was exceptionally sweet. After a situation with the valet, the manager brought 11 glasses of champagne for our entire table  to apologize. Totally unexpected and great birthday surprise to our birthday girl. I would not only recommend this place, but would continue to be a regular! :)"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint. Several of us came here after a day of business meetings and it was so good, some of the group went back the same week.  The seafood Mac and cheese and Brussels were my favorite sides. The steaks are ridiculously good and they make a great old fashioned. You will pay for it, but it is worth it ! Service good also."}
{"text":"Went for my anniversary with my wife. Food is incredible, no doubt. The service was a bit lacking surprisingly but that may have been because it was a Saturday night at 8pm and the place was really busy. The waiter seemed to push the most expensive items on the menu which annoyed us. But the cocktails and food were excellent nonetheless. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Food was good and so was service but won't be back.  Private dining for work related dinner in my opinion was way overpriced. Small portions for side dishes.  Bad overall experience from a business standpoint.  So many other options available...Ocean Club, The Henry, Ocean Prime. I'm going to stick with them."}
{"text":"Met with some friends for dinner last night to check this place out. Even for a Thursday night it was crowded and lively.   They did quite a job renovating the spot. Gorgeous inside. Also quite a bit Bigger than it looks.  Let's talk food.  Appetizers: shrimp. Spicy, crunch, delicious. The meatballs were tasty and better than expected. Fried calamari was pretty standard, nothing exciting. Also split a small ceaser salad which had a poached egg on top. Nice little touch.  Entree: I happened to be starving when we ordered so I went with the 22oz bone-in ribeye. It's came out cooked perfectly. They use some sort of house seasoning with garlic and cayenne I think. It really brought the steak to a better level. I am salt addict and I really didn't have to add anything to it. One of the better steaks I have had in a while.  Sides: the creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts were all pretty standard and yummy. The Mac and cheese was exceptional.  Desert: the only part of the meal that I was not impressed with. I shared the strawberry butter cake which is mandatory when visiting a Mastro's restaurant. They flavor was there but the cake was dry and overcooked. Not to say that it didn't disappear quickly but it was not the typical butter cake I have come to crave from Mastro's.  Overall, service was great, food was awesome, steak was epic, and I need to go to the gym. Welcome to Phoenix steak44."}
{"text":"Food was good, cougar central, very loud"}
{"text":"By far one of the best meals my husband and I have had... I'm sort of scared to cook for him now since he said I can probably never beat their food ha. We're on our honeymoon and decided to have one elaborate meal out, and we couldn't have made a better decision. The entire staff is amazing and so attentive, and our server Sara was a doll! She gave great recommendations and was so friendly and answered all of our menu questions. I started with the beet salad and then got the braised salmon (melt in your mouth!) and Brussels sprouts (minus the bacon) He chose the meatloaf and mac n cheese and crushed the garlic bread. We shared a bottle of Pinot Noir and came home happy and with leftovers. Overall, the night was amazing and a highlight of our trip out to Arizona. :)"}
{"text":"The best filet I have had in this town in a long time. Pricey but worth it.  Ryan Phillips, our waiter, was incredible. He could do well at anything he sets out to do. He made our entire evening special."}
{"text":"First tip, this is not a cheap restaurant. But, well worth the cost.   My husband and I decided dinner here on Jan 1st sounded like an amazing way to bring in 2018. We weren't disappointed.   They have complimentary valet parking, which was nice being as I was in heels.   The ambiance of the restaurant is dark, and romantic. There is a fireplace in the back that gives off a nice light. The Well located speakers everywhere make the music available through out the decently sized restaurant. Def an upscale place. No flip flops or tank tops! This place deserves your best.     First, we were seated near a television playing the Alabama vs Crimson game (by happens chance and desire) but, it didn't feel like a sports bar. Which, I liked quite a bit.   Our waitress was amazingly sweet and she kept up with us all night. I will say the tables are a little congested, so you will hear many conversations simply because of how close you are. Privacy, on a busy night, probably isn't happening.   For drinks we ordered (me) a ginger peach (strong bourbon taste, not too sweet) and (him) Blood Orange (sweet, cosmo type drink). We enjoyed them all dinner as they were quite large. We ordered the seafood bar (king crab legs, Giant shrimp, and oysters) which was fairly filling and the seafood tasted super fresh. 5 different dipping sauces was awesome as well. We then shared a KC prime and the Hassleback potato. Forewarning, the steak plates are VERY VERY hot. Don't touch them! The steak was cooked to our desire (medium rare) and was amazingly juicy. The potato's were to die for. Even full, we wanted more. We then ordered the begneit tree for dessert. Came with 2 dipping sauces and was the perfect ending to an incredible meal. Sharing was the best option for us, and it filled both of us up!   One complaint I have is half the menu has MP in place of a price because the price must change frequently. However, we were told the wrong price for something, then charged more. They rectified the issue, but it's an inconvenience that could be avoided.  The second complaint I have is the small bar top table chairs (tall, white, fake leather) are deteriorating. They were quite ripped and flaking and shredded. For the cost of OUR dinner, I'd be able to replace 2 of them at the minimum.   Overall, I loved our experience. It was expensive. But we knew it would be. If you're looking for a date night place to impress, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Made a late night reservation for Steak 44 on a Sunday night with my husband.  Love the atmosphere in the restaurant.  We sat close to the bar, which gives a lively feel.  My husband ordered the bone-in rib eye and I ordered the beet salad.  The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I love the sound of the steak sizzling when they bring it to your table.  We also ordered the corn creme brulee which was a combo of dessert and side dish.  Loved it!  My beet salad was only okay.  Service was suburb."}
{"text":"Steak 44 is my go-to for celebrating. It's pricey, but worth every penny. I love to treat my girlfriend for her birthday, Valentine's Day, anniversaries, etc.   I get the bone-in ribeye - the best I've ever had - and a side of their au gratin potatoes (I believe they have changed the name to the Chef's Potatoes.) My girlfriend always gets the filet mignon - it seriously melts in your mouth.  Each steak is cooked to perfection and served on a a boiling hot plate. The meat is literally sizzling when it's placed in front of you. The aromas are fabulous and the food is unbeatable.  Even better than the food - the service. The staff does everything they can to make sure your experience is nothing short of perfect. On one trip, we had our leftovers packed up to go, but when we returned home we realized they had mixed up our order with someone else! When they called me the next day to ask how my dinner was, I mentioned the mix-up and was pleasantly surprised when they sent us a gift card to make up for it!  Try out this beautiful Arcadia restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I travel every week and to find a good restaurant is important to me, whether it is to have a few drinks after work or have a nice. quality dinner. I like the Vibe here, very busy and the Phoenix crowd is great !! I ordered the filet that was cooked perfectly and I loved the grilled snap peas. The only thing I had an issue with, if you could call it that, was that I bought a bottle of wine, that I took the remnants with me; however I had to pour a glass for myself at one time. With 4 bartenders it is all about service after you spend $125 for a bottle of wine, I should not have to pour my glass. Not a big deal but again, I should not have to with a place as classy as this.  I will certainly be back, my steak was the best !!!"}
{"text":"This is a very upscale steakhouse. Period.  Very nice atmosphere, quiet in the private booths in the back and overall a very \"happening\" place!  I would highly recommend and would return again and again. It was a very nice touch when the manger came around and spent time with us at our table just chatting!"}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary. Very upscale restaurant. Great service and very tasty food.  Don't usually eat seafood but their appetizer  which had crab in it was yummy. They treated us with a free desert and the manager called us and followed up the next day which I haven't seen in any other restaurant. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Went to Steak 44 for our Anniversary, and had the bone in filet.  Only have to say one thing, best steak I have ever had.  Even beats out my favorite spots in Vegas.  Pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Extremely attentive staff!!! Our water glasses were always filled and the wait staff even overheard me telling my friend that I was hot, so almost immediately, the a/c got turned down. We enjoyed our waiter as well - he was witty enough to be personable, but professional enough to be on point. The next day, the hostess even called and left a nice message on my voicemail, making sure everything went well. Now this is A1 customer service."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had. Recommend getting the prime rib, over the filet, for more flavor. I've had both, and they were the two best steaks ever. Lobster and cheese potatoes were great, too, as was the King Crab. Service was top notch, initial garlic cheese bread was legendary. Seriously though, I warn against going crazy on the bread. It's really good, like REAL good, you won't have room for the main course if you eat it all. I have had their desserts and they are good, but I've never had enough room in my stomach to give them a fair shake.  As expected, you will pay a lot here. But it is well worth the cost. The few meals I've had at Steak 44 are definitely among the best I've had. Great spot for a celebration or for taking someone on a date. You will want to make a reservation, obviously.  Something they could improve on is the table space. Every ime I've eaten here, it feels really squeezed for fitting everything on the table (bread, wine glass, water glass, silverware, plates, menu, candle). If you get a lot of things a la carte, get ready to juggle. The waiter we had even struggled a bit, like playing Tetris with dinnerware.  Go here. If nothing else, go for that bread...and steak, too. :p"}
{"text":"stop by and shared a steak with my colleague. The food was well prepared. The brussel sprouts where perfectly charred. The creamed corn was to sweet for my taste, it was more like candied corn. The baked potato with truffle    also left a little to be desired because it seemed like I was eating more the skin of the potato due to the potato being small. The crab and mac was good but not fantastic. Finally the star of the show a bone in rib eye \"Black and Blue.\" All I have to say, \"Fantastic!\""}
{"text":"Hands down best restaurant in Arizona! Can't get enough. The service is above and beyond!! Dan always takes great care of myself as well as my friends. Robbie, Ibti, Bryan, Amanda, Robert, Jonathan, Kathleen, Margerita, Jackie, and my fave Alyssa!!! All amazing and make me feel like a superstar when I'm in there. The hospitality is above and beyond in every department. Best atmosphere/ambiance, spectacular food, and always leave with a smile! Can't go wrong with steak 44!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food, wine, drinks and ambiance. One of my very favorite and one of the very best restaurants in town!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short & sweet about how amazing this restaurant is because I could go on & on. The service, food, drinks and environment is RIDICULOUS. I wish we lived here or we would be here every weekend. BUT the great news is they are opening their 2nd one in Houston!!!!!! Which is where we live. We WILL be there constantly. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What Godfather II was to the Godfather is what Steak 44 is to Mastro's.  It is possible to improve upon perfection!  Every dish was meticulously crafted to provide the best taste and visual appeal.  As expected the meat is superb but don't leave without enjoying notable sides like the  crispy shrimp, asparagus, sweet corn, and lobster mashed potatoes.  The wait staff was attentive, professional, and very helpful.  The ambiance doesn't quite have the polish as Mastro's and the adult contemporary top 40 that was playing too loud detracted somewhat from the experience, but that is mere nickpicking to an otherwise superb dining experience."}
{"text":"I don't normally spend time writing reviews, but thinking about my experience with this place just made me want to write my first one - so here we go! This place was amazing. I came here with my SO for his birthday. I wanted to treat him to the best steakhouse the valley had to offer. After doing some research, it seemed like Steak 44 was pretty up there so I bit the bullet and made a reservation.  From entering the door to being seated, everything went pretty smooth. Loved the atmosphere, though being walked through the main room, people weren't joking that this place is LOUD. Fortunately, I think because it was my SO's birthday and that I made a reservation, we were seated in this backroom with about 8 tables which was significantly quieter than the main room! The bread was to die for and my server (wish I remembered his name) was ready and willing to answer any questions we had about the menu. He also went out of his way to make my SO's birthday a good one!  The steaks -- my god, they were out of this world. Something about how tender, juicy, and melt-in-your-mouth they were just blew me away. My SO was dying over the truffle peppercorn sauce, it's truly a must if you're getting a steak! The sides were delicious, definitely a lot more filling than I expected as we had to take some home. Then our server allowed my SO to pick out a dessert for his birthday treat which I thought was a nice touch (usually restaurants just default a birthday dessert). He picked out the beignet tree which was not only Instagram-worthy, but just delicious. As my SO described it, \"eating it healed his soul\" haha. The dessert came with two dipping sauces, and had a nice 'happy birthday' touch to it as well.  Now, something about Steak 44 reminds me a lot of Ruth Chris if you've ever been there, but my SO and I were PREACHING that Steak 44 is way, way better than Ruth Chris. This place is an absolute must visit for special occasions, great company, and delicious steaks!"}
{"text":"Great service, really like the waitress who is super friendly and knowledgable. Ordered the colossal shrimp and calamari which is delicious. But when I ordered the bone in ribeye, oh man, I don't know how much salt they put in there. I never ate this much salt in a steak in my life. Maybe it is a one time thing where they messed up, but for a $50+ steak, it is not worth the money."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff. Prompt seating for a table for 2 with reservations. My filet was cooked to perfection. A good selection of wine and meat. Great ambience too! Will return for more!"}
{"text":"The whole ambiance is what sets this place apart. Being from NY I felt like I was home.  From my 22 oz ribeye to the desert I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"WOW!  I took my mother here on 4/8/17 to celebrate her 69th birthday.  She was visiting from Minneapolis where we eat at Manny's and Murray's all the time.  We were blown away by the food and the service.   What a classy yet casual laid back atmosphere too.  I would like to commend our server Jane, she was wonderful.  Her suggestion of pairing our steaks with the corn creme brulee was spot on - I'm still dreaming of that stuff!  My bone in ribeye was melt-in-your-mouth.  I cannot wait to return to Steak 44."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriends and were not disappointed! All of our food was cooked to our liking; all were juicy and flavorful. I'll be coming back here every time I come out to Phoenix! Can't wait to take the hubby. The service/staff were all super friendly too."}
{"text":"Went for my son's birthday, best part of dinner were the salads, the superfoods and the heirloom tomato, which were phenomenal and are what raised the rating to 3 stars. The steak came at the wrong temperature, our waitress was uninterested in us, because a friend of hers walked in and she spent the entire time chatting and catering to her. The atmosphere was not what I was expecting, I was expecting an upscale steakhouse, but it felt more like a casual pub, the tv was on, the music too loud, yelling patrons at the bar. I was a little disappointed. Would go for a weeknight meal, but definitely not for a special occasion or with guests."}
{"text":"We visited Saturday for happy hour. The ambience is wonderful. We enjoyed cocktails and appetizers.  Everything was very nice. I met the manager, Nick.  He gave me a personal tour of the restaurant. We will definitely be going back.  Excellent.   I'm giving 4 stars as I have not had dinner yet.  I'm sure it will be perfect."}
{"text":"OK, back to Steak 44.  This time we brought friends.  Boy, it's hard to beat this place.  Excellent food - steaks, seafood, sides, wine - all outstanding.   Flawless reservations.  Even though the place was packed, we had table right on schedule.   We told the receptionist that we brought friends to treat them to a good meal and to spend some time talking.  She guided us to a quiet spot away from the noise of the bar.  Service was wonderful and we never felt rushed.  I honestly doubt that you can get a better steak (or scallops) at any price in this town."}
{"text":"Yesterday night I came in to Steak 44 with my boyfriend. He is in the service, and this was one of my last days with him before I can't see him for a while. We couldn't have picked a better place to go. Our server Robert was beyond amazing, and I am a server as well so I don't complement other servers very often but WOW. We both ordered the New York strip, and neither of us expected what we got. Our steaks were perfectly cooked with the best seasoning I've ever had. I highly recommend this place to any steak lover. Your life will change forever after your visit here."}
{"text":"Steak 44 is by far the best steakhouse in The valley.   Feel free to get the surf and turf the lobster, scallops, shrimp are some of the biggest and the best I've had.   I'd go back twice in one day its that good!    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great experience  Martinis generous and prepared perfectly. Steak, creamed spinach and oysters were outstanding. Had dinner on 7/11 and restaurant sent a car to pick us up at the hotel and take us back."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Steak 44; it was my first time. The atmosphere is a little loud but the tables are round so you don't have to yell across to one another...you just intimately lean in to talk.  We ended up staying in the lounge area to eat.  I like to people watch and it certainly makes for a better time than a booth in a dining room.  I am still unsure who we saw at the table next to us but our bets are on, baseball player, BMX rider (that was Rich), or Rapper.  I didn't have enough alcohol to ask before he left.  We started off with a chef's choice seafood tower.  Sans oysters, we have  been out before and determined that we aren't so cool that we like the slurpy sounds that go along with a well shucked oyster.  We were amazed at the amount of seafood that we ended up with.  It is slightly misleading because it is more of \"tower\" on its side but a standing tower would require some scaffolding.  I was too full to eat steak and would have settled on just the company but I was peer pressured into a slab of beef.  Much like other first time pressure moments...I Liked It!  I am really glad that he did;  the steak was the perfect temp on the inside and melted like, \"buttah\" in my mouth. I would have to say everything was perfect except the Asparagus Fries.  I know right...how could something called \"asparagus fries\" not be yummy?  But they are battered so heavily that they come out sort of phallic.  It wasn't so offsetting that I didn't eat them.  But, the reality is that they were kind of blah; surprising since they were supposed to be seasoned with black pepper.  The potatoes were amaze balls and I would recommend them.   All in all, it was a fun evening and if asked if I would go again, I would say, \"run that back.\"  In the end I have enough seafood leftovers (that they boxed and put in the cooler) and steak to feed a third world country or skip a few meals.  Well played.    #runthatback."}
{"text":"First off this place was so not what I was expecting. Friends of mine from Phoenix talked this place up and I figured it might be a good spot for a special occasion dinner. I was expecting a quiet modern steakhouse and, well, it is definitely not that. It is very Scottsdale. We showed up for our reservation on time.  The lobby of the place was mobbed and there were three young hostesses facing computer monitors looking a little overwhelmed. I checked in and we went and stood in the corner and waited. The place has a crowded bar with big screen TVs.  Lots of semi drunk bros out on the town.  After a while a hostess came and asked me my name again and walked off. The music was extremely loud like a lot of places in Phoenix.  It was so crowded and uncomfortable I was getting a little put out given I knew I would be spending serious bank on dinner and had expected a stress free time. I went back to said crowded hostess stand to voice my displeasure and we were then seated right away but the reception was not particularly welcoming.  We did get a nice table and the dining room is pretty swanky. I will say once we got seated the acoustics in the place seemed decent as it was possible to hold a conversation over the music. After the rocky start service was generally good. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and delicious. Sides and appetizer were good as well.  Definitely a lively atmosphere. It was my mothers 79th birthday and she loved it which is what counts.  I'll probably be back at some point but be sure you know what you are getting into..it was kind of a raucous scene.  Dinner for two of us was about $300 including a nice bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Service was excellent as was the food. They seem to really care about your dining experience. Sides were tasty and steaks great."}
{"text":"The 18 ounce Bone In Filet in phenomenal!  Service was great. Make sure you get reservations, as this place definitely gets busy. For desert, the Red Velvet Bread Pudding.............................."}
{"text":"Steak 44 is the best steakhouse in AZ hands down!  The atmosphere is fine dining at its finest, and the GM Daniel and Executive Chef Marc knew how to take care of this FitFoodie.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  The new york strip farina style (Egg on Top) was the best most tender melt in your mouth steak I have ever had.  Both appetizers crispy shrimp and the fried deviled eggs were both on point.  Both had an amazing crunch with a little kick on the back end from the sriracha and garlic aioli.  As for the sides the you have to go with the crab and shrimp mac n cheese along with roasted sweet potatoes with bourbon marshmallow top!  If you have enough room in your stomach for dessert and even if you didn't suck it up and get the crispy banana split which the salted caramel gelato - crispy cinnamon sugar banana - luxardo whipped cream is perfection.  Then you must get the beignet tree.  These light fluffy covered in powdered sugar is the best closer to a meal you can get.  So, looking for the best steak in Arizona?  Stop.  You found it at Steak44.  BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"We arrived three minutes before our reserved time to wait for another 15 with a half empty dining room. When we asked about our table, their response was that they only had two cocktail servers for the dining room. Not my fault... I made a reservation so they knew we were coming... They put us against a wall next to a party of 8 which was not a pleasant experience.   We ordered the seabass, pan-seared crispy on the outside and medium on the inside. It came medium rare and soft on the outside which was obviously sent back. The manager came by and the fix was made. It came out and was an amazing piece of fish. They remade our sides which was great as well. Definitely a service recovery. In the end, they brought us a complimentary dessert and took care of the seabass and our side from our bill. The end of the meal was a success and a complete 360 from the start. Great food and drinks.  My only feedback to the management when he stopped by the table is to not touch the guests. The gentleman grabbed my shoulder before I even saw him and it was not pleasant. He kept his hand there the entire time he was at our table... Twice he did this and it was uncomfortable. Just feedback for the future."}
{"text":"Really love the seafood here. If you're not a huge salt person, definitely make sure you order accordingly! Lobster Mac and cheese, lobster, scallops, man everything is quite tasty. Even sitting at the bar to eat is a pleasant experience! So dress up and get yourself here. It's a great weekend dinner outing."}
{"text":"Great experience tonight. The meatballs were perfectly seasoned, great wine list, the chopped salad good, my steak cooked to perfection and our warm cake dessert super decadent. Finished of our dinner with a nice glass of knob creek reserve 14 year: well balanced, some smoke & a great amount of vanilla... Perfect with my dessert. 4th time here & plan on going back in a few weeks"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Started off the night with a glass of Meiomi and lead into the Sautéed Shrimp and Chef's PB&J. Jon spoke of of the Wagyu NY Strip and my date had a twinkle in his eye. I got the New Bedford Scallops and they were seared to perfection! Our sides do matter and we got the King Crab & Rock Shrimp Mac & Cheese, Brussels with Bacon, Wild Mushrooms and the Truffle Fries! My mouth is watering again thinking about our dinner!"}
{"text":"Best resturant, best service and the absolute best food I've ever had in my life. This was my second time visiting Steak 44 and they never disappoint! I brought my mom for mothers day. Everything from the filet mignon to the asparagus fries, everything was cooked perfectly and not to mention the world class service! Our server earlier tonight was Ryan and he was hands down the most helpful and friendly server I've ever had. Before we even had the chance to run out of anything he was already on it! He went above and beyond. Not to mention good conversation in the mean time. I will definitely be going back and requesting to sit with Ryan again in the future!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here for our 2nd anniversary and we will definitely be coming back! When I made our reservations I advised them it was our anniversary and asked for a quiet table, which they happily obliged! Our server, Sarah, was friendly and attentive the entire night, congratulated us on our anniversary and never let our glasses go less than half empty. I had the New York Strip and wild mushrooms and my husband tried the bone-in Rib-eye and the whipped potatoes, everything was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I can't remember exactly what our desert was called but it was a delicious warmed butter cake with caramel and pecans which vanilla gelato, and they even wrote \"happy 2nd anniversary\" on our plate which was very sweet. The next day, they called to thank us for dining with them. This was one of the best dining experiences we have had in a long time and we are very happy we decided to celebrate such a wonderful day at Steak 44. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"A fine dining experience with dim mood lighting. Staff are exceptionally attentive but not bothersome. Steaming hot fresh bread is brought to the table in its own pan straight from the oven. While the calamari appetizer is a must, the steaks were not as impressive. The outer crust of the steak was over charred giving the whole steak a charcoal flavor. The steaks are served on 400 degree plates and the meal is followed up with a pleasant warm towelette. Overall, this is a highly romantic and fun experience with the steaks falling just short of perfection."}
{"text":"I love Steak 44. My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here last March, the food and service was exceptional. We took our family here for a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner this year and the service and food was again wonderful. I ordered the lamb chops which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. I love the beignet tree it is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I just came for drinks but it was an overall good experience. The bartenders are super attentive and friendly. They made a great Cosmo. I will tell yall that it's an older crowd that comes here. I'd come back again though."}
{"text":"Steak 44 gets a well-deserved 5 star review. What really makes this restaurant stick out amongst the rest is their customer service. I was expecting great service since this is a pricey steakhouse but they really did impress me a lot. Let's start with the atmosphere. When I walked in, I wasn't really sure what to expect but it had a very warm and inviting ambiance. It was already pretty packed in the bar area when we arrived around 5:30PM for our reservation. We were able to get a seat passed the open kitchen (which is amazing by the way) and I feel as if we got a perfect table because it was not as loud as the from the restaurant close to the bar. Okay okay, I'll stop talking about all this secondary information and get straight to the food.   Appetizers:  Fried Deviled Eggs-crispy, perfectly fried. Sriracha aioli was amazing!  Crispy shrimp- pretty good, nothing too special  Calamari- once again, good but not great   I came with a party of 5 and we had the following for our entrees:   1. Bone-in ribeye- succulent, juicy, cooked beautifully  2. Salmon- literally the best salmon I've ever had. Melted in your mouth like butter  3. Crab cakes- fresh, huge lumps of crab meat.  4. Wagyu beef filet- best piece of steak I've ever put in my mouth. Barely even had to chew it since it was so freakin tender.  5. Bone-in filet mignon- didn't get to try it but it looked good and my dad really enjoyed it.   Sides:  Mac n cheese: good flavor, nice and cheesy, but the sauce was a bit grainy  Wild mushrooms- fantastic flavor and i loved how they kept it very simple.  Roasted sweet potatoes- perfectly cooked potatoes and I loved the marshmallow topping.   Last but not least, dessert:   1. Caramel cake-rich, buttery, with ice cream to cool it down. Unbelievable  2. Red velvet bread pudding- moist, flavorful, sweet, one of the best bread puddings I've ever had.   Finished off the night with a nice cup of coffee. Of course this place you are going to splurge but it's a great restaurant for a special occasion or when your just looking for a really dang good meal. This definitely isn't going to be a restaurant I go to often since it is pricey but I will absolutely keep them in mind when I really want to treat myself."}
{"text":"Always thoroughly enjoy our meals!!  This is my family's go to special place!!  Huge portions and the quality is top-notch!!"}
{"text":"Was fabulous.  I only occasionally spend $40+ on a steak.  Let me tell you though, it is worth it!  Was fabulous!  A bit on the noisy side.  (It was busy)"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and everything was very good. Service was top notch and the majority of our meal tasted great except the mushrooms were a little salty as well as the edges of my bone-in ribeye. I really like the ambiance of the restaurant and the decor is beautiful!!  I also enjoyed watching the chefs put together the seafood towers!  Overall, I prefer Steak 44 over the other chain steakhouses."}
{"text":"Steak 44 was amazing! Went here last night for our anniversary and everything from the food to the customer service was so awesome. Since they knew it was a special occasion, they sat us at one of the booths with the view into the kitchen. Our server was so friendly and attentive (not overly so) and the food came out really quickly. We ate the following: Parmesan rolls, crispy shrimp appetizer, bone-in filet mignon with truffle butter and a side of scallops, bone-in ribeye, corn creme brûlée, Mac and cheese, and shisito peppers. Everything was delicious and the steaks were still sizzling when they got to our table, and cooked perfectly. They gave us a complimentary dessert to end our meal too! It is definitely on the pricey side, but reasonable for a steakhouse of that quality. Totally worth it! Can't wait to go back for another special occasion :)"}
{"text":"If you wonder where all the great steak restaurants went... What City Hall was in the late 2000s, Steak 44 took a step further.  High quality food (at a matching price), a nice wine selection and if you get to sit in their booths next to the kitchen, it does not get better in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this amazing restaurant! My husband and I were treated so special from the moment we walked into the place! The food is amazing from the JUMBO shrimp appetizer, to the 8 oz petite filet entree, to the amazing dessert! I highly recommend Steak 44! Simply perfect!"}
{"text":"Simply the best in steak house in Arizona  There is no close second  Seafood tower, wagyu beef, and cream corn brulee"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint! Great service and great food! Would definitely recommend the Ahi Tuna even though this is a streak house. The people in my party who got steak were very pleased as well. Portion sizes are bigger than normal fancy steakhouses so if you are wanting the same entree and want to try a lot of the sides and/or salads, one meal is PLENTY for two. Would highly recommend the corn creme brûlée and the roasted Brussels sprouts as sides."}
{"text":"This is probably the best steakhouse I've ever eaten at. The ambiance was great. It's a lively place with a great vibe. The service was great and the food was delicious. I loved the bread and my petit filet with truffle butter. My honey had the New York and he also enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friend found this place on Yelp on a whim and BOY am I glad to have come here to celebrate my 25th birthday. It's definitely a $$$ spot, but you're getting premium cuts of steaks, chops, fresh seafood and delicious sides, so for special occassions, it's most definitely worthwhile. Come with a stacked wallet and an empty stomach!  I'm from California and I've had my share of steakhouses in the Bay Area, but never have I ever had steak that tasted SO GOOD in my life!!! It's unbelievable how awesome Steak 44 is, I really want to come back to Arizona and eat all of this delicious food over again!   All of their food was mouthwatering, and I mean everything was just cooked perfectly and deliciously seasoned. Here's the breakdown of the good good:  Steak: I tried three cuts while I was here because my friends and I sampled each other's food. By far, my favorite is definitely the rib eye. Rib eye is more on the fatty side. When it's cooked with the bone, it is extremely flavorful, fatty and tender. The meat really should be enjoyed rare to medium rare, there's no better way to eat it. Second favorite of mine has to be the filet mignon. You can't go wrong with that cut. It's less fatty than the ribeye but it's very tender as well. The New York Strip was the last one I tried. Of the three, it was my third favorite. Don't get me wrong, it was all REALLY GOOD. I mean you're getting high quality beef for a great price and many different cuts, I can't complain about any of it!!   Add-ons: Add different types of butter to the top of your steak for MAXIMUM flavor! There's truffle butter (damnit Nicki Minaj, had to go and ruin this for everyone), blue cheese, and black truffle green pepperorn. You can make it a full on surf-and-turf dinner by including lobster tail for $38, crab cakes for $16. For fancier people, $18 for that foie gras. Didn't get to try the add-ons but if I'm looking to go all out next time, you'll definitely catch me on that fancier side.   Seafood: Oysters available on the half shell - Blue Points, Kumamotos and the Kusshis. Blue Point Oysters are probably the bigger ones of the three. $4 each and its serve with mignonette, horseradish, cocktail sauce and not quite sure what the last one was. Comes with minature tabasco sauces, so cute!  Appetizers: Braised pork belly was one of my ultimate favorites of the night. Glazed with honey and chili, the pork belly was sweet and juicy. And the bed of spinach below absorbed all that wonderful flavor, it was a hefty bite no doubt.   Sides:  Mac and Cheese - I could eat this easily on its own! I like my Mac and Cheese chunky and not watery so this is cheesy melted perfection.  Creamed Spinach - you really can't enjoy steak without a large fill of creamy and rich spinach. Crispy Hassleback Potato - I mean, to be able to get crispy edges and keep the middle soft and cooked perfectly? TEACH ME YOUR WAYS!!! Roasted Brussels Sprouts - mmmmmmmm bacon and brussel sprouts has to be the most perfect pairing in the whole world.  Creme Brûlée Corn - THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Creamy corn with a little sugary crust, torched beautifully so the sugar hardens, I can even.....  I left the restaurant smiling and ultimately satisfied. Had to take a lot of the food home because I was simply stuffed to the max. This was one of the best meals I've had and my friends and I each stared at each other in disbelief while we ate the delicious food. Looking forward to the next time I'm in Arizona again!!"}
{"text":"This newly opened eatery is destined to be a big hit. Lots of beautiful people and a great bar scene! If you are single, go there and you will probably meet a new friend to dine with. We were visiting from LA and went with our cousins. Had a nice table adjacent to the kitchen windows which are highly visible throughout the establishment. We ordered a plethora of great appetizers follow by great entrees and wonderful side dishes. We split a rich and hilarious slice of butter cake for dessert. Everything was up to our high standards except our wait for the entrees was slow. A really fun time and will go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"What a great place and experience! In town for a wedding and Steak 44 was highly recommended. I tried to make a reservation via Open Table but open table didn't have a time for me...we decided to give it a try anyway. We walked in and the hostess told us we could either have a table or sit at the bar so we decided to sit at the bar first. We had a lovely conversation with the bartender ( I don't remember her name) she made some great suggestions on what we should have for dinner. When our friends arrived, the manager helped us to get a table and the yummy begins. We started with the burrata, oysters and , jumbo shrimp cocktail so good!!! For our dinner we had steak with the lobster and truffle topping and scallops and for sides we had brussel sprouts, lobster and rock shrimp MAC n cheese, mashed potatoes and corn crembrule can I tell you how delicious it was. Extra added touches that were above and beyond...when you order champagne, they give you chilled glasses!!!!! And they serve your sides to you on your plate. Darren went above and beyond to make sure we had a great late night meal ( sorry we kept you so long) For dessert we had beignets and the blonde cake....holy yum!!! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and it was great, tonight was our Anniversary and being mid week we just wanted to go to a great dinner and choose Steak 44. We arrived and were seated right away. Most upper scale restaurants like Capital Grill, Mortons and Flemings ask if you are celebrating anything, not here, not a huge deal. We ordered drinks and an appetizer, the pork belly, it came out and was great. We awaited our main course, never did our waitress ask if we wanted another drink from the bar, and when our food arrived it was less then impressive. I had the rack of lamb and my husband the large filet with the bone in. I have honestly had better service and food from Chili's Bar and Grill. I am so far beyond disappointed in the service and food tonight, had a manager even bothered to make rounds I would of shared this opinion, but again I guess Steak 44 is just not of the same caliber of Capital Grill, Mortons and Flemings."}
{"text":"Celebrating our Anniversary at Steak 44 was an absolute joy. The food was outstanding & service was exceptional. The waiter accidentally dropped my husbands steak as he was taking away our food to package it to go. The manager came over and apologized which wasn't necessary but appreciated. My husband was sent home with a new steak & mashed potatoes. We also received a s'mores dessert in addition to the dessert my husband ordered as a surprise when he made the reservation. I thought our dinner was amazing but the desserts, OMG!! We'll definitely go back to Steak 44!!"}
{"text":"Thought I would take the family out for a nice dinner. But service was very slow and the server seemed almost uninterested in serving our table. The food was fair nothing to write home about, think it may have sat in the window to long. Overall for the price not a great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went here for my 30th and they were so accommodating. The food is amazing. Make a reservation for sure. Don't show up too early. I did that my first time there and had to stand by the bar. My feet were killing me. There's a creme brûlée corn I think, it was great. Filet was wonderful. Dessert amazing. Very posh place. Pricy but worth it. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Best Steakhouse in Scottsdale. Period. Went for dinner on a Saturday, waitstaff was remarkable and knowledgeable. Deserts are amazing, (Vanilla Caramel cake is a must) I had the Steak Farina with a fried egg on top of my Bone-in Filet! If you want to spend some money, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I have been to steak houses all over in many different cities and this has to be one of the best steakhouse if you can go to. It's very similar to a Mastro's or Ruth's Chris. I went here with my girlfriend and I got a ribeye which was absolutely delicious. The sides are phenomenal too. The prices are a little high but that is what you expect when you go to a high-class steakhouse with excellent service. The ambience is great and usually there is an upscale crowd hanging out in the restaurant or the bar. The location is very good to in Arcadia right off 44th St. If you go to this restaurant I recommend dressing up a little bit since it is definitely a nicer restaurant. Overall I think you will be happy if you go here"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for a date and the food was great and definitely worth the pay! The customer service was the best I ever had"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I have been twice, the food and service were both top notch. Great selection of drinks, seafood and steaks. The steaks have been cooked to perfection each time. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Wow I am extremely disappointed in our visit over the weekend. I love this place and often enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere but they fell far short in all categories. I haven't been for close to a year so I don't know if this bad experience was a one time thing or there has been a monumental shift in the restaurant. It started bad with the watered down drinks then continued with the stagnant shrimp and tough overcooked steak.  I was embarrassed because I exclaimed the greatness of this place to my guest who was treating as this was a special occasion. After the dinner we talked about the experience and I genuinely felt bad because as you all know it's very expensive and I chose the spot. I will have to think long and hard about returning as the whole experience (and food) left a bad taste in my mouth. I wish I had my phone to show pictures of the food they looked as unappetizing as they tasted.  Whatever has changed here I surely hope they change it back to the way it was because justifying a few hundred dollar meal is very hard to do with this recent memory standing out in my head."}
{"text":"Hit Steak 44 on a staycation in Scottsdale with my wife. We were headed to Mastro's and pretty excited about it, until our Uber drive told us about Steak 44. Thank you Uber driver! To put it simply, one of the best meals I have ever had. The service was outstanding. They sat us without a reservation (OK, it was a Monday night). The waitress was enthusiastic and took care of anything and everything we needed. The food stole the show. I was curious about the fried deviled eggs as an appetizer, and they were awesome. Our entrees included a 12 oz. Filet, cooked to perfection, and my wife had the crab legs (MP). I wish I had a picture of the crab legs. They were the biggest I have ever seen, spilling over the plate. They were prepared perfectly, and prepared to be enjoyed, with very little work involved. The sides were outstanding, as were the cocktails (old fashioned, wine). The timing of everything was on point. Steak 44 is without a doubt, our new, go to,\"enjoy yourself\" restaurant in all of the Phoenix/Valley area. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We celebrated our son's 22nd birthday here and it was awesome!  We had a great table, separated by a glass wall from the kitchen...very quiet but very entertaining. Nick, our server, was EXCELLENT and so was the rest of the staff...friendly but not intrusive and always available.    We started with a round of cocktails (excellent) and Nick suggested a chilled shellfish appetizer plate. We received a large selection of crab, lobster and jumbo tiger prawns all served over ice with a selection of four sauces.  Fabulous. We then proceeded to the mains with a New York strip (the thickest cut I've ever seen), a filet, salmon and lobster.  Each entree was prepared to perfection and stunningly delicious. We added three sides: Brussels Sprouts (a must), garlic broccoli and lobster mashed potatoes (terrific).  Dessert was a beignet tree. I couldn't find the room to try that but my wife and son said they were excellent. We also enjoyed a nice (affordable) bottle of Merlot with dinner.  It was an overall amazing and very memorable experience. Kudos to the service and kitchen staff. If you go, ask for a booth next to the kitchen if you can."}
{"text":"Even though I'm only 17 I work hard to be able to afford to dine here every once in a while and it's by far my favorite steakhouse in the valley after trying almost all steakhouses. Amazing food and great atmosphere, you will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"Took my son for a celebration dinner, ASU grad, we all loved the experience. The host was pleasant, the server was excellent, and the floor manager was gracious in bringing us a sample of their delicious crab cakes. The steaks  were tender and delicious as were the scallops. The brussel sprouts, mushrooms, mac and cheese, and hassleback potatoes were fabulous. Our Server Melanie surprised the graduate with a warm vanilla caramel cake that was awesome.  We also had the fabulous s'more in a jar. This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Our experience was top notch. Everything was executed flawlessly.   Anniversary night !! And not a single complaint.  Wine- an amazing selection. We went for a bottle of stag leap.  The entrées- my filet was cooked to absolute perfection. Literally the best steak I have ever eaten. (Sorry Mom, your a close second) the lobster tail was stunning and succulent.  Scallops and sides- absolutely breathtaking and delicious.  The atmosphere was great. Music not too loud- staff incredibly friendly- lights were set to a perfect ambience.  If your celebrating a special occasion, or just want to go to a swanky spot. This is your hidden gem. It's by no means cheap- so bring your wallet.  So to top it off. This is the 2nd place I would ever give a 10 out of 10 stars.  Cheers to Steak 44- you have a new regular"}
{"text":"FIRST Steakhouse I've EVER been to & it was amazing! My boyfriend made reservations tonight for our 9th year anniversary . He actually worked on putting the panels up in their glass kitchen! Amazing job I must say  The food was superb! I wish there was more that I could say but this place left me speechless . The staff is amazing & very very helpful with the menu . Again, it was my first time .  Overall, Steak 44 is nothing short of perfect! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"One of the best steak places I've ever been to. I would rank Lugers as #1 and this is #2. But very close. Steaks were perfectly cooked. Good thickness and char and not overcooked given that it is served on a hot plate. So so good. And Sarah, our server was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food and cocktails. Five star service with valet parking on the house. The steaks are to die for. And drinks ranging to the best high ends."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about my dining experience at Steak 44. Some girlfriends and I went for here for a friends birthday celebration and I already want to come back. Their happy hour menu is killer! Their Coppola Cabernet Sauvignon was bold and smooth. For appetizers we ordered a mix of east and west coast oysters, meatballs, steak and fries, and pork belly. Everything was to die for! The steak was cooked perfectly and was generously portioned for the price point. The oysters were large and the mignonette that was served added a great flavor. I did not try the meatballs but my friends said they were fabulous. The real stand out of the appetizers was the pork belly. It was perfectly tender and juicy and the sweet Thai chili and sautéed spinach was just perfect. It was so good I had to order another one.   Our server Alyssa was great as well. She provided excellent recommendations on wine and food. According to her, the second pork belly took too long because the first one was not up to Steak 44 standards and they redid it. Her and the managers were kind enough to take it off the check, which they did not have to do. We didn't even notice the time! That kind of service and attention to customer satisfaction sets restaurants like Steak 44 far above the rest. I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"The best steak I've ever had!!! The filet mignon and ribeye was extremely good. Not only the food but also your interior is great as well  Love you Mastros group"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a friend for happy hour.   I had the double \"maker's mark\" manhattan, and she had a vodka martini (not on the HH menu.)   I had the steak & fries and she had the  jumbo shrimp cocktail.  Yummmm!!   The steak medallions were oh, sooo good.   Seasoned, fried, and cooked to perfect.   Her shrimps were huge!   She had it prior and loved it.   Since that appeared to be her dinner and there were only two, I didn't try it.  The manhattan was perfect as well.  A customer, who says he goes there EVERY Friday sat next to me.   We started a conversation.   He ordered a bottle of Belle Glos Pinot Noir.   He was nice enough to share it with us.   My friend had it prior and was familiar with the wine.   He said he has a private reserve at the restaurant but didn't order one of those.     He ordered the bone-in ribeye and baked potato.   The ribeye was mainly for his dog, but he and I ate a few bites.   YUMMMM!   Actually, it tasted like my steak.   Seasoned to perfection and tender.  The service was great.  The bartenders and bar backs are very attentive, friendly, and professional.   The general manager gave me his card for those times myself and other friends decide to check it out.  Sorry I don't have a photo of what I had.   I started eating it before I remembered to snap a shot of it.   Oh, well.   Next time cause I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I drove in from Ca last night and stopped here for a drink and some late night bar snacks.  They make a mean Martini! Don't order a second one or you'll be walking on your lips for the rest of the night.  I had some shrimp and a wedge salad, both of which were excellent. However, it was the bar staff that made the visit so enjoyable. All the bar staff were very attentive, friendly and made time for brief conversations with the guests.  I'll be going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is a winner as far as I'm concerned, if you want a \"well\" done steak.  No I don't mean, well-done steak ordered by anybody in the restaurant, by all means.  We went on our 38th Wedding Anniversary to this restaurant, which used to be C.C. hush-hush as to the real name of the predecessor.   My steak was greatly done and it was from the \"small\" menu.  Price hunt all you want, you will come up with great excursions, whatever you choose!  Can't wait to go back there, on whatever occasion:  First Date?  2nd Wedding Anniversary (does anybody really celebrate this one?).   Enjoy it, go!  Worth the drive too, for a romantic date.  Celebrate!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it to Steak 44 to celebrate my graduation from Grad School. A VERY fitting way to celebrate. Steak 44 is very contemporary upscale and modern with a very classic feel to it. I would feel just as comfortable enjoying a family dinner here as I would on a date, or out with a friend. It is really conducive to a memorable experience no matter with the occasion. The menu and selection of meats and cuts are reminiscent of a New York steakhouse, with enough non-meat dishes to appeal to any non-carnivores you may be with.  We started with a generous serving of lightly fried, calamari. There was PLENTY for 5 people, and the pieces were large, and the sauces delicious. No over-fried little squids here! Next, I head the Cesar Salad, which was fantastic, and served with a poached egg. I have not had a Caesar Salad with a poached egg since I ate at Pescatore in New Zealand, so this was a VERY welcome and pleasant touch.  I had the \"small\" filet mignon for my main, which was PLENTY. It was grilled a perfect medium rare (leaning more toward the rare side, which I LOVE), tender and flavorful. Sides are family-sized, so I partook in some asparagus, mashed potatoes, and loaded baked potato. Our server was polite and professional and extremely patience with some of my eccentric relatives.  Our evening was to celebrate a special occasion and I can think of no better place for us to have celebrated. Like I said, I can see myself bringing a date here, or maybe just stopping by for a yummy cocktail at the bar,  Will definitely be back next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Took my wife, her cousin, and mother in law for steak on March 26. My wife and I have been to all the nice steak places in Scottsdale and Phoenix such as Mastro's , Capital Grill, Flemmings, . We only go when her mother visits. This was our first visit to Steak 44. Our experience was poor. My mother in laws steak was full of grizzle and very tough. I gave her mine and ate hers. Poor quality for a petite filet. I told our waiter Josh about it after dinner before the check was delivered. I expected some modification of the bill. Got nothing. Much better choices for steak exist in this area.  I would like to add that I along with three others returned to Steak 44 on July 4. We had a fabulous dinner with superb service. Thank you to the management for providing a second chance to experience your restaurant. Would definite return."}
{"text":"Absolutely ON POINT from the start. Previous Yelp recommendations caused us to try it! We got most of the suggested side dishes. Took home all except Mac and cheese. Really pleasant and attentive service from bartenders through the dining room: loved it."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I'm an expert in, it's high end steak. I've done all of the classics (Peter Luger, CUT, Rathburn, Gibson's, etc). Steak 44 is definitely in the top 5. They execute absolutely everything well, from the moment you arrive until you exit the restaurant. It's modern and sleek inside with an open kitchen. There are a few tables with glass windows that allow you to view the entire line while you dine. You can request these tables in advance, and it's amazing. They also have a great raw bar as you enter the restaurant.  Service is top notch. There are a good 3-4 waiters per table. Our waitress was still in training, yet she was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She knew the menu extremely well and coursed everything appropriately.  The fresh baked garlic Parmesan and sea salt bread is amazing. It comes out piping hot in a skillet and is so rich. I could be happy with a few baskets of this and call it a night.  The pork belly appetizer was excellent, seasoned with Asian sauces and tender like butter.  The truffle baked potato and mushroom blend were excellent as well. But the star of the show was he Steak. A perfect 22 ounce bone in ribeye medium rare and charred. As a steak expert, I do not say this lightly...the best ribeye I've ever eaten. Better than Peter Luger. It cut like butter, I barely needed a steak knife. The fat was rendered perfectly.  For dessert, do not leave here without trying their legendary beignet tree. Served with creme anglaise and Nutella sauce."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Thursday -- no reservation? No problem! There was just two of us in town for business and we decided steak was a great idea. When isn't steak a great idea? This place was packed!, but they still sat us immediately and the server was there to greet us right away. I ended up choosing the Wagu beef cap 12oz and my partner has the ribeye. The food was fantastic, zero complaints ! We will be back againo"}
{"text":"I've been back twice now in the last month.  Both visits have been outstanding experiences.  The first visit was for happy hour.  Sitting at the bar is great people watching.  The bartenders are real pros and provide for great service.  I love the steak and fries happy hour dish.  It's delicious and just the right amount of food.  I was in a couple of weeks ago with some friends.  The service at our table in the bar area was outstanding.  In particular, Daniel was such a gracious host.  The bone-in ribeye was mouthwatering.  All the sides were great.  I also really enjoyed trying a couple of wines from their new wine menu.  To top it off, the beignets for dessert made me feel like I was in New Orleans.  Well done Steak 44!"}
{"text":"So I went here for the first time last night with a group.   I will start with the good things first.  We got the deep fried deviled eggs, seafood tower, and crispy shrimp to start.  All of the appetizers I would probably rate 4 stars as they were all excellent.  The seafood was very good and had the oysters, crab, lobster and shrimp, very tasty.  The crispy shrimp was really good, I could eat that all day long.  For dinner I got the 16oz New York strip cooked medium.  The steak was not bad but it is far from the best I have had.  It could be one of the best in Phoenix maybe but it was a little above average to me.  For that price I would expect the steak to knock my socks off and they didn't deliver.   If I could do it again I would probably get the sea bass.   In conclusion this is a good restaurant with really good appetizers but just a average or below average value for the money."}
{"text":"What an amazing night we had at Steak 44. We were in Phoenix celebrating my graduation so wanted a special place to celebrate and boy did we find it. The service was impeccable. Our waiter Jason was knowledgeable and patient. I hate feeling rushed through dinner. It is about the experience and it was wonderful. The food was to die for! We had the meatballs, colossal shrimp and fried deviled eggs - all delicious. For dinner everyone except me got the large filet (I did the bone in ribeye) and they were cooked to perfection. I have never seen a filet so big in my life! Sides were the shrimp and lobster Mac, potatoes that started with the letter D, Brussels, creamed spinach and the regular Mac and cheese for my kiddo. Everyone raved about how great it was. The red velvet bread pudding was ridiculous and my husbands \"adult\" peanut butter shake was awesome. While it is expensive, the portions are huge and the quality is unbeatable. Kenny, the manager, also checked in on us and we received a phone call the next day from reception to ensure our night was great. Would definitely go back if ever in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"I met some of my lovely friends here for happy hour last Friday and low and behold my favorite bartender from the Merc Bar also works at this place! ( Hi Aaron) needless to say I felt extra special because he not only called me out but already knew what I wanted to drink. My friends of course were looking at me like \"hmm Ebony do you ned to tell us something?\" so I explained how I knew him and of course they were like aha..   The night started off slow but got increasingly busier as the night progressed . Sitting at the bar gives you a birds eye view of everything happening around and believe me there was a lot to see. My friend and I shared a lobster grilled cheese sandwich and some braised pork belly. Sweet baby Jesus both were delicious. The guy sitting next to me ordered a steak and I swear I wanted to ask him for a bite because it looked and smelled amazing. The entire staff was very attentive which was nice considering how busy this place got. All in all, a great new spot to come for happy hour however I do  I look forward to coming to try this place out for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING food and service!  We came for NYE and a special night out.  We ordered several sides to try in addition to our main course.  I had steak with a crab cake - well worth the extra money for the crab cake!  Potatoes with Gruyere was one of our favorite sides.  Could've done without the mac and cheese. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place use to be the old Cork and Cleaver! Wow has it transformed itself from a then ok restaurant to an amazing steakhouse. Steak here was to die for, better than most steaks in town. Friday night is insane in bar, loud crazy beautifully dressed people drinking/laughing and wall to wall party! Dining area quieter but still full of energy. Sides were good, salads very flavorful. Service spot on. I had the scallops cooked to perfection. Didn't do desserts as we had carry out bags. Big monsoon near sunset rolled in as we were dining, we had the best views in the house on their extended patio enclosed dining on the north end. Very special place. We'll be back! Parking in back, otherwise valet."}
{"text":"My wife and I read all the great reviews and decided to give this place a try. We walked in and the ambiance was beautiful. Service was excellent. The server was attentive as well. I ordered the 22oz Bone in Ribeye and I have to say that it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Cooked to perfection. Dessert was also amazing Red velvet bread pudding. My wife and I both agreed we liked it better than Mastro's. Steak 44 is a must try Steakhouse in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time experience was fantastic. I started with a dozen oysters Blue Points and Pacific coast Eurekas. Fresh and tasty. Second course was an excellent beet salad and for dinner I had the bone in Ribeye MR. The steak was mouth watering delicious. Other highlights were a Scallops entree as well as the beef short rib. Highly recommend this joint, they have a variety of different dining areas and a nice bar where you can watch sports on the big tvs."}
{"text":"WOW! !! Let me start by saying this post will be long but worth reading.  I don't know where to even begin... If I could give more than five stars I would have. First let me start off with walking up to the restaurant they play great music, love it, don't change your playlist that was just the start to a great dining experience .  Then getting greeted and seated by such amazing friendly staff. Our server Nicole and all the other staff that assisted were above top-notch professional, that were always checking up on us and we're very attentive. I was very impressed when they changed out the table linen from white to black when they noticed we were wearing dark clothes in order to avoid the white linen showing up,very impressive. The manager Daniel came out to greet us, he was very friendly and personable. Now to  the food... beyond amazing! I ordered the Kansas City steak my husband ordered the ribeye. My husband and I make it a point every time we travel to visit a steakhouse this is by far one of the best steakhouses.  We have've gone to many steak houses from New York all the way to California, it's our thing.  I could honestly say I would come back to Phoenix just to visit Steak 44. Just when I thought we were done with a spectacular dinner they treated us with this amazing layout of desserts. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they literally brought me to tears which is a very rare occurrence for me. I was so impressed with how wonderful we have been treated and attention to detail, these people went above and beyond to make this evening so special for us. I am so grateful that we chose Steak 44 for our special dinner.  I thank wholeheartedly all the staff for such a special evening even  to the staff I didn't meet from the chefs in the back and all the other servers who just provided great customer service and thank you Daniel for being such a wonderful manager.  A message to the owners  of Steak 44 you have a very special team working for you. This place is amazing!  Definitely a must when in Phoenix. Xo"}
{"text":"Steak 44 has definitely grown on me over the years since it opened... it's a great spot for a splurge (both with the prices and the rich food) to celebrate a special occasion.  Steak 44 is definitely right up there with Mastro's / City Hall with more of a local feel, and it doesn't hurt that it's also super conveniently located close to my home.  You probably cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, but some of my personal favorites that I seem to order again and again are:  -Oysters -Chilean Sea Bass (although sometimes you may find they are out of it :( -Bone in Ribeye -Brussels Sprouts -Butter Cake  Everything on the menu is shareable.  I typically try to find someone I'm dining with who wants to split the ribeye or the sea bass and then share starters, sides and dessert.  Steak 44 makes a solid dirty martini and has an excellent wine list as well.  Service is attentive and professional, but if you ask for any recommendations, be prepared as you'll likely be sold on the highest priced item(s) - food and drink included.  Note... they also charge for their special ice balls.  (My husband can't seem to get over this!)    Their bread basket doesn't quite compare with Mastro's, and while their Butter Cake is amazing, I think I like the latter better too.  That being said, you cannot go wrong at Steak 44 and if you're wanting to go and looking for company, please let me know... you won't have to twist my arm to join!"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary and it was delicious. The Wagyu steak was the best I've ever had. Do not miss out on the creme brulee corn. The mac and cheese is also amazing. Service was Top Notch."}
{"text":"This was one of the finest dining experiences we've ever had. We were able to secure last minute dinner reservations for my husband's 50th. They went above and beyond to accommodate and welcome us. We started with two lobster sized shrimp and a sampling of oysters. Next, we had the wedge salad. It was crisp and flavorful served on a chilled plate which is a nice detail. For our entree, we had the bone in rib eyes, sautéed spinach and crab mashed potatoes. The only negative here was the inferno hot plate the steaks were served on. It took close to 10 minutes for them to cool down. This was fairly annoying especially because we were ready to eat and didn't want to wait for our food to cool. The steaks were still incredible. Dessert was an amazing butter and Carmel cake. The service from beginning to end was top notch. This restaurant makes it to the top of our list of favorites. Nice work, Steak 44!!!!"}
{"text":"First visit here for the hubby's birthday after we heard such great recommendations. We made a reservation on Opentable a few weeks in advance since it gets busy. I asked for a quiet, romantic table so they put us in a large inclosed booth where the view was the open kitchen/seafood selection. It was private and very romantic. It was an awesome table and the mood of the entire restaurant is dark and moody which is perfect for a romantic date. They also have complimentary valet out front so all you need to do is tip of course.   The service was excellent from everyone we encountered. The hostess, the server, and even the gentleman that filled our water were all super nice and very friendly. They have a great menu selection and huge drink menu. They were so kind and made my husband's birthday special by saying happy birthday right when we got there, gave him a personal hand written card, and a complimentary dessert of our choice.  They start you off with hot complimentary bread. Bread was just alright. For our food order we got:  - Crispy Shrimp appetizer was AMAZING! lightly fried and great flavor. Perfect amount of heat. - petite 8oz filet was delicious, buttery, and very tender.  - bone in 22oz ribeye was massive! Charcoal grill on the outside but super juicy in the middle. My husband added the burrata topping on steak. - Sides: corn creme brûlée and whipped potatoes. The corn was INCREDIBLE! I couldn't stop eating it. Sweet cream of corn with the perfect toasted sugar on top. Yum! This is a must have!! - Dessert: warm Carmel cake which was delicious. The cake was super moist and paired with cinnamon pecans, ice cream, Carmel sauce, and whipped cream  Everything was cooked to perfection! We left feeling so full but so satisfied. It is pricey but great for a special occasion. The food is worth the price. We will definitely be back.   Highly recommend. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and I don't know why I haven't left a review before.  Each time is always better than the last.  Like I forgot a steak could taste that good until I have it again!   On our last visit we were seated in a quiet back room which was different than previous visits.  It was actually quite nice.  My husband and I started off with a Guinness and a a cocktail with ginger beer I can't remember the name unfortunately.  It was a little strong for me so I switched to a sex on the beach, which was perfect and reminded me of exactly that ;)   We started the meal with the crispy shrimp, every time we order this my husband bites in and just melts over how yummy they are.  I tried to dried deviled eggs which were so yummy.  We continued our food adventure with 2 filets.  His the larger version and mine the petit.  Served along side we ordered mashed potatoes (standard) corn creme brûlée which is soooo amazing and delicious and we also had their Mac and cheese!    I love that they bring the steak played out at 500 degrees and then serve the sides right onto the scolding plate.  I am partial to a little crisp edge to everything so it just elevates the meal for me!  The steak has this great buttery flavor and texture that just melts in your mouth with each and every bite!   We ended the meal with a few more beers and cocktails (we were pretty tipsy at this point) in addition to the butter cake which is a staple and a must order for me and the smores in a jar which I didn't even get a bite of because my husband inhaled it within seconds of it hitting the table! All I know is the waiter set it down, lit the marshmallow fluff on fire and its a definite possibility that my husband ate it while it was still flaming! :P   All in all a fabulous meal much enjoyed by 2 parents who don't get a lot of solo time away from the kids!   Well worth getting a babysitter for the evening ;)"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving - first time here and absolutely loved it! The service was phenomenal and the food was prepared perfectly. I especially appreciated the offer of a black napkin and the phone call today to ask how our dining experience was. Those little extras define a fine dining establishment and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our first experience at this restaurant was outstanding. Our server Adam and his team of helpers were fantastic. Menu items were explained thoroughly and everything our server recommended tasted great. We ordered Crispy Shrimp (delicious), beet salad with goat cheese  , a chopped salad, lobster Mac and cheese, the filet and ribeye, salmon and ahi tuna. The food came out quickly and was delicious. For dessert we had the \"donut tree\" at least that's what I called it. After a few disappointing experiences at Mastros I think I have found a new favorite."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to find the restaurant was packed! We had made reservations but we came almost 45 mins earlier than the scheduled time and we were still seated right away. We were greeted by our waiter shortly after we sat down. I was very surprised at the way the waiter introduced us to the menu and we were well educated on the best options to choose from. He even explained to us about all the wines in terms of what suites our likings best. We ordered the meatballs and the crispy shrimp for appetizers and they came to the table within minutes. The shrimp was spicy yet delicious and the meatballs were great with the marinara sauce accompanying them. For the entree we ordered the ribeye, the petite filet, and the ahi filet all of which were delicious. The sides to go with the meals work differently than most restaurants in a way that you order any given number of sides and they are distributed to everyone's plates. The sides we ordered were the corn crème brûlée, dominick's potatoes, and the asparagus fries. Super yummy! Lastly for dessert we had the strawberry gelato and the red velvet bread pudding that came with a vanilla gelato. Those were to die for!! When we finished eating and the table was cleared of our plates, warm, wet hand towels were brought to us along with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Overall the food was excellent and the dining experience was amazing. Would definitely want to come back!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS AND MOUTH WATERING is what I have to say... I ordered the filet mignon.... it arrived on the table sizzling hot dripping in butter......WAIT...I'm not ready for this... I had dreams of this steak and now I'm looking down at it.   The filet mignon was so tender and juicy.  I could have eaten two more steaks.  The creamed corn... out of this world. Don't get me started with the crusted mash potatoes. WOW!!!!!!  Dessert was a carmalized cake with ice cream.  Once again the dessert gods answered my prays.  This place is definitely a must do it again real soon!"}
{"text":"Simply said, I think I finally found my stake house in AZ. Welcome to me!! The wagyu is phenomenal"}
{"text":"Great experience, great food, amazing food and wine selection. My favorite was the cheese board, creme brûlée corn and the red velvet bread pudding  very knowledgable staff. We went back the next day with a group of friends that love it. Be on the look out for these places popping up."}
{"text":"Actual rating is 4.5 stars, which is very impressive for a restaurant that has been open just one week.  One thing to appreciate about the Mastros team is that they know what they do well and do not greatly depart from it. They really have the steakhouse formula down to a science and so Steak 44 is just the logical extension of what they have historically excelled at. The core of the menu is expertly cooked steaks and seafood, ala carte traditional sides (with some twists), raw bar, cocktails and good selection of wine.  I had heard that Steak 44 was intended to be a more casual and less expensive concept than some previous ventures. It doesn't seem to me that it is really less expensive, but it is a bit more casual. The interior of the place is drop dead amazing. It one of the best look restaurants in the state and is sort of compartmentalized, which helps with noise and privacy while still keeping you in the action. Our favorite \"compartments\" are the booths that have a glass wall shared by the kitchen. That is a very risky thing for a restaurant to do, but it really lets you be in the furious action of the kitchen, while shielded from noise and heat.  As for the menu, the Mastro folks have decide to offer some smaller choices, which has been a \"complaint\" at other venues (all you really need to do is split things, though). There are smaller steaks and larger steaks. The salads, sides and desserts are now individual size versus shareable, which allows for a lighter meal or the ability to try more items.  The great: deep fried deviled eggs, raw bar, perfectly cooked steaks, halibut, brussel sprouts, tempura asparagus, cocktails, sorbets. The halibut was probably the tastiest and most skillfully cooked halibut i've had in a long time.  Could use work: the bread course (bread balls browned in a cast iron skillet with herbed butter) - messy and not that good, steakhouse stuffing (seems like the same bread balls reformatted) - unexciting and lacking in texture.  The service was excellent, balancing cordiality with professionalism, which is a tough balance to hit. Our waiter, AJ, was very knowledgeable and paced the meal appropriately.  I am very impressed with this new undertaking by the Mastros team, particularly with how well executed it is right from the start."}
{"text":"One star for the food, a second for the people watching.   I'm being generous.   Four of us walked in at 9 PM on a Thursday, all wearing suits and in good spirits. Sat at the bar, hoping to have a drink and ultimately something to eat because we just came from a conference and were starving.   I live just north of Steak 44, in Paradise Valley and was really hoping to like the place so that it could become a regular go-to destination.   I ended up in embarrassed to take my out-of-town colleagues there. It wasn't as if the bartenders were spending more time with other patrons among the light crowd, they weren't really paying attention to anyone.   Finally, \"What would you like to drink\"? I've never been here before, so how about offering to help me out with the wine selection?  I guess I'll hurry up and choose something since I seem to be imposing.   Likewise, absolutely zero assistance, enthusiasm or even advice about the food menu. I ended up getting the meatloaf with béarnaise on the side (my substitution), which was actually quite tasty.   There are too many other great restaurants in the area to put up with mediocre service. I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my birthday with my husband and 2 kids. Service was perfect and food was flawless. We ate shrimp app, crab and avocado app, a filet, a Waguy and the potatoes that I can't remember the name of. Everything is exactly how'd you expect it to be. We thought this was better than maestros. The waiter and waiter assistant didn't seem bothered at all with our 2 kids, which some waiters can be annoyed with. So we appreciated that. We also had the butter cake which is reason enough to go there!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in the valley right now. Hopefully they can maintain their commitment to excellent in years to come."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing the first time we went. We sat in the very back as we were in a group of six. The service was great the food was great, the entire experience.   However our second experience was not as great. We sat in a smaller room near the kitchen with another couple. The section of space that had 4 tables in it was very small and compact. Not easy to hear people talk. Don't get me wrong the food was great but our server was awful! He didn't care to make sure our food was correct he did not come back at the appropriate times to check on us.   The dessert we ordered which was the small tree came with 5 pieces of the dessert however, it was really like 4 and a half as the 5th was so small! We had finished out dessert and the other couple we were with was finishing their cappuccinos and some of the waiters came and took our water glasses. Others had started setting up the room and the other tables as if they were preparing for a big group. And someone stood outside the section as if he were waiting to kick us out like security!   Our bills were in NO WAY cheap! We even tried to contact the manager but he never called back. To say the least we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I dined here on Saturday night (3/26/16) with my best friend who was visiting from out of town.  It was my first time here and was very excited to try a something new.  Before I get into my review, please note that I am very \"meat-centric\" when it comes to steakhouses so my criticisms will land mainly on that subject.  First, it was very busy and the place was definitely buzzing.  You sensed that this was the hot new spot in town and people seemed to be enjoying the atmosphere.  We were greeted at the hostess stand and were promptly taken to our table.  Our server was very attentive and knew the menu well.  However, we did have to ask for the music to be turned down because it was so loud that our server was yelling just so we could hear him.  We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, a side dish, and our steaks.  Everything came out in a timely manner.  In general, the service was good.  So now, time for my nitpicks.  When my steak came out, I cut into it to make sure it was cooked to my liking (i.e., medium rare) only to find that it was totally raw inside.  I told the server and they fixed the problem.  The steaks are served on a hot platter swimming in sizzling butter.  I know there are many people who like this, but I personally find this to be a detriment and an interference to the meat's natural flavor.  Also, I found that my steak was overly seasoned.  So every bite of my bone-in rib eye was dominated by butter and salt.  There was no room for the natural beef flavor to come through.  I believe that if you have high quality ingredients, such as prime aged beef, then there should be very little in between the beef and my taste buds or at least a proper balance of flavors.  On the other hand, I had a bite of my friend's New York Strip and that was very tasty and had better flavor balancing.  So, to you meat purists out there trying to decide if you want to give Steak 44 a shot, I would say go for atmosphere and the \"scene\", but be wary about which cut of meat you order.  My rib-eye, which is already a fattier cut of meat, did not fare well as presented.  Maybe a leaner cut of meat will serve your taste buds better.  Overall, the total experience was just OK for me.  I have been to many steakhouses in my time so my standards have been raised quite high.  I wish I could've been blown away by the steak but unfortunately I'm left wanting more."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  I wasnt fond of our seating area as we were right next to a service station so was constantly hearing staff discuss restaurant operations.  However I guess I just should've asked to move.  One of the best in AZ"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I hate to say this but the quality of the bone in filet was the best I have ever seen presented ( I age my own steaks so I know)   The stone claws were on point and the atomic horseradish is a must try if you can handle the head rush.   Good wine list and actually less expensive then Dominick's.   Pappy Van winkle wasn't half bad as well"}
{"text":"A very nice steak house. Great for a business dinner. Would be a special occasion type place. Everything was delicious and top notch service. It is a little pricey so as long as you know that going in you will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This high end steak house was \"spot on\" in service, style, and quality!  The staff made the extra effort to seat us as we were walk-ins, and didn't think that they would have room.  Polite, attentive, and not to mention the filet would melt in your mouth!  Exceptional!"}
{"text":"The golden standard for steakhouses in the Phoenix area, I am told, is Mastro's.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it is the same people who started Mastro's that are running Steak 44. I have been to Mastro's, and I would say Steak 44 meets the golden standard. Execution was flawless the night we were there, steak perfectly cooked, top notch quality, excellent service. The manager Kenny came by our table several times, which was a nice touch. We really felt like we were taken care of."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Phoenix. Not very well known, but a hidden gem.   Service was fantastic from the beginning. Complimentary valet. Well dressed staff with expert knowledge. They called the next day and thanked us for dining there.  Steaks: Prepared perfectly. High quality meat. Not over/under grilled.  Sides: Sides are pretty big. I think two people can comfortably share 2 sides. No need to get 2 sides per person.  Appetizers: I got the calamari and it came with 3 dipping sauces. It wasn't too oily, but was prepared just right.  Cocktails/ Drinks: Great selection of some well known scotches (Macallan, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Glenmorangie, JW Blue, Talisker 10). Thought they were maybe a bit too pricey. Cocktails were delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing steak!  Best in the valley for sure. Service was fantastic and seafood tower was crazy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite steak houses in the valley! Their customer service is AMAZING & food is always delicious!   Request to sit in the private back room! It has an awesome view of the patio & beautiful vines.   And remember, all the sides are shareable! ;)"}
{"text":"Seriously my fav fav place in the Biltmore area! I have made it tradition to have my bday celebrations here since they opened up a few years ago! I just recently went for my bday celebrations last week and they have went above and beyond to accommodate my party of 15! Beautiful environment, fun decor and cool vibe with having several different rooms to sit and eat in. I prefer to eat in the kitchen area where you can see everything being made but my party was too big for the maximum 8. Their service there is impressive, the moment I sat down the server brought me over a personalized hand written bday card from the general manager and staff which I thought was a tasteful touch. All staff there were very friendly, helpful and made us feel at home.    Food is always delicious! I recommend anything on the menu, but if I had to break it down I would say  for appi's, Crispy shrimp and fried deviled eggs. The rib eye, filet Mignon for main course. I haven't tried any of the seafood but my friends rave about it! Side dishes I always love getting the smashed potatoes, creamed corn or roasted Brussel sprouts. Who can forget the yummy butter cake or beignets on a tree!  Overall, this place is one of my fav. Places to eat in phx and one of the top 3 places I recommend anyone from out of town has to try when they come to visit!"}
{"text":"Well, we got there, of course they had complimentary valet service. Once we got inside, we were seated almost immediately and our hostess was very nice and sweet to get us a private booth for the night and we had this amazing view of the kitchen. Once we got seated it just kind of got awkward from there, our waiter came off the wrong way with us, I think he might have even mumbled something derogatory towards my wife. Never once did he smile, but he did get the job done, for that I will commend him for living his shallow, dull life style. Other than that, my steak came in sizzling and was cooked to perfection, I absolutely have no complaints about the food as it was perfect to my liking. Once we finished the night we left, and everyone was literally lining up to thank us and to have a good night. I'd totally be back, if I got a different waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Filet Mignon, everywhere I go they are missing something., but not here!!!   My steak cooked perfect flavor and just melted in my mouth. We ordered too much food appetizers and sides...I think, but all still very good for my breakfast next day.  We were arrive around 6pm they are already super busy, but the bartenders they were still so nice and tried to fit us in at the BUSY bar.  High quality of meat and absolutely I will be back. Highly recommended by ME!!!"}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 stars. I've been here several times, and I can confidently say it's the best restaurant in Arizona. Scott was our server this time, and he was absolutely fantastic. It was my birthday and the manager Jake came up and made me feel very special and the customer service and hospitality was beyond outstanding. I would be doing everybody a disservice if I didn't write this review and express out amazing this place really is. From the food, to the environment, to the staff."}
{"text":"This is the greatest steakhouse in town! The steak was amazing and actually was large enough to feed two. We also ordered a few sides the Mac and cheese was by far my favorite side."}
{"text":"We love Steak 44. It hits all the right notes with excellent food, beautiful decor and exceptional service. The warm Parmesan rolls get things going wonderfully. The steak is the star but you can't go wrong with any of the sides and the desserts are spectacular as well. They have a great selection of reasonably priced wine too. The prices are less than Ruth Chris,and steakhouses like it, but the food is so much better. Well worth every penny. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for our birthdays. Had reservations and they seated us right away. Service was great! The wine selections were abundant and reasonably priced. I had the Ribeye and my wife had the filet. Both steaks were really good. Only negative were the steaks had a little less flavor than we had hoped. I believe they said it was \"wet aged\" and not dry aged. So don't know if that brought the flavor down just a bit. But both steaks still tasted very well. That's why we gave 4 stars instead of 5. The Caesars salad was awesome. And the loaded baked potatoes were incredible."}
{"text":"10 stars if I could - this restaurant served the best meal (besides one other in Vegas) I've had in my entire life. Been to Mastro's, Oceanclub, Ruth's Chris, Argentine restaurants, etc. all over the world. From the hot towels served and personalized birthday card from the general manager, every nuanced detail you could possibly expect from a restaurant is here. Also a plus is the atmosphere - back room is quiet even when completely filled so you can still hear your party from across the table. Sean was an amazing server and the drinks? Strong and delicious. Will be coming back which is a rarity for us. Highly recommend the filet, potatoes (one with gouda and mozzarella and onions that my girlfriend calls crack potatoes), and creme brûlée corn - yes melts in your mouth. It's pricey, get over it. If you're a foodie no price is too much for an amazing dinner. It's in line with any other good restaurant I've been to, don't mark off a star for that unless you can give me another place with equal food quality and service for somehow cheaper. Won't happen. COME HERE, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is amazing the service is amazing! I went here for my birthday and we ended up ordering a lot of food. Obviously, we didn't eat it all and took home leftovers. I loved everything about this place except where we were seated. I am assuming it the \"birthday section\", but where our table was located, it was terrible. We were too close to the back door and there was waiter or busser station right behind us, so the guy had to constantly go behind us and would bump my bf chair. That really sucked. However, I would give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"Steak was very good! Cooked to perfection. Service was very good. Atmosphere wonderful. Side dishes were flavorful, but spinach was too salty and boy do they over use garlic.  All of the red wine by the glass is crazy, crazy, crazy expensive, so went for the white wine, which was average. Also, the meal was about the same amount as a car payment for a pretty nice car....what can I say, my steaks are looking better and better every day."}
{"text":"I tried to email them from their website but it was undeliverable?  Why is there no contact  button? Why was the broken one so hard to find?. Anyways I'll post  my email here, in email form because I'm tired and I'm not editing it.  Steak44-  We had a decent night at your establishment as first time diners, but I would like to share a little feedback from our experience.   It was our anniversary and my husband surprised me with a reservation.  Our server was excellent as your management top notch, i just hate to complain around other diners, so i reserve my thoughts for email.   I wish there would have been some sort of soup appetizer, and maybe butter with those deliscious rolls! i imagine a lobster bisque or chowder would go great with your raw bar!  I understand it is more profitable to offer bottled soda but know some of us are really splurging for a night and it can feel a little like nickle and diming to a customer to have to pay for seltzer refills.   Our busser cleared our plates as i was still eating. I literally had food in my hand as he took my bread plate and then tried to take the left over rolls, i did not let him, but my plate with food was already gone.   This was kind of the main faux pas of the night. Unacceptable.    The wedge salad was crisp and creamy, but the abundance of blue cheese was really overwhelming. Its a little overboard and takes away from the other delightful flavors.  I had to return the 500 degree plate because im too spacy to not burn myself. Our server was excellent in accomadating this request and all requests of the night. I had to ask for steak sauce.  I prefer to be offered though, as to not feel annoying to my server. The steak and crab great, the asparagus needed the bottoms trimmed a little more,  very woody.  The people outside the kitchen were loud. We were seated in the back and could hear all the gossip and chatter among the staff.  We did have to send back the truffle fries twice and your manager was so kind to offer an extra desert, and though we were asked multiple times how our meal was, i just dont like sharing feedback in front of other diners as i think it is rude.  I also don't like to leave such a lengthy Yelp review but you left me no choice as it is impossible to contact you through email.  your establishment is truly beautiful and we would love to return for another special occasion!  Next time I'll try the corn creme brulee. A little dissapointed but an overall good night!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were debating for our anniversary dinner if we wanted a good view or a good steak. We both decided on the steak and after doing some research, decided upon Steak 44.   This was our first time here and we were blown away not only by the food and drinks but by how hospitable the entire staff was! From being told \"Happy Anniversary\" by the hostess, our waiter and the manager to taking recommendations on what to order. From the crab and avocado appetizer to the best filet I've ever tasted...Steak 44 has set the bar high!   We were even comped a dessert that was decorated for our anniversary.   I highly recommend checking this hidden gem out! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!!    In every way.   Service on point. Nicholas was awesome.   Food delicious. Came on anniversary and Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"The crispy shrimp appetizer was amazing! I got the steak which was fantastic and my boyfriend got the salmon, I've hated fish my whole life but I tried his fish and it was so delicious!! Their bottled ice tea is amazing, I've never had such tasty unsweetened ice tea before. Service was amazing, food was  amazing, and so were the drinks. Great place to spend our anniversary!"}
{"text":"If you want to have a spectacular meal or a place to host a fancy meal this is it! Not only are the service top notch and seafood is brought in fresh every day the steaks are done to perfection Sacedon is very intimate or you can have a party of 20 and still feel very intimate. They run a very classy business here everything we ordered was phenomenal definitely a must try if you're in the area if we head back here for any reason we would definitely be back,great place to eat great memories created & good times!"}
{"text":"Guys, I went to a different restaurant last night and wish I had come here.   Service: awesome. Sat at the bar. The bartender, the chef that brought my food out and generally everyone in the restaurant was very nice and professional.  Steak: I got the 12oz medium rare. Perfection. Seriously, probably better than Harris' in San Francisco.   Cocktail: hangar 1 martini. Delicious and perfect.  All in all, an awesome spot."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner here tonight! The staff and food met our expectations, especially the dessert! We are sure to return in the future and sample even more of the delicious food.   There was a nice moment when a possible manager or above came by to comment on how well our 1 1/2 year old was behaving. We were thankful for the praise.   Thank you all at Steak 44 for making our family evening out so amazing and comfortable. You welcomed us with a little one and treated us like anyone else, that means a lot!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Joshua took great care of our large party. Perfect for a business dinner!"}
{"text":"My visit to Steak 44 steakhouse started as a bitter one, but it got transformed to a sweet and lovely night at the end, thanks to Triple Js. Although I dislike long reviews, this one of mine might be a very long one so apologies in advance!   Reserving a table was easy breezy thanks to the Open Table app.  Got seated soon after arriving which was very nice considering that the restaurant was super busy. It didn't take very long until it became evident that the table is in the middle of the way where even our waiter almost dropped the menus while passing our table. Yes, it was that bad. To make things even worse, there were plenty of LOUD guests that just wanted to yell instead of talking normally. I perfectly understand, perhaps one of the most precious traits that we Homo Sapians Sapians have, is the ability to speak. Having said that I don't enjoy being in super loud places while eating. And that is exactly where this visit started to change course.   After letting the waiter know that we would like to be moved, we were approached by one of the managers named Jake. He apologized for the situation and directed us to a dining room in the back of the kitchen area that was called the \"800s room\". The room had no more than 8 tables which was perfect and lovely and away from  alllll the loud crowd.   Soon after Josh our waiter and his assistant, John introduced themselves and made the dining experience very pleasant.   Now, it is worthy to review the food itself. The super food salad was tasty. The Jumbo shrimp cocktail was Double Super Jumbo. I am not sure if these shrimps are genetically modified to be this jumbo but they were delicious. As for the main course, it was suggested to us to order the off-menu special of wagyu steak. The suggestion was accepted and ordered sautéed corn as the side of choice. The wagyu steak was amazing. Although I am not a big fan of medium cooked steak, the plate that it was served in was soooooo HOT that the steak was cooked to my liking after is was served which was perfect.   If you ever visit Phoenix, you should try to dine at this restaurant. I have had plenty of great tasting steaks in the past, this steak is among my top 3 steaks that I have ever eaten. If the Triple Js (Jake, Josh & John) were not involved in this dining experience, this review would have been a solid 3 star review, but they saved the day or night along with this review!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday dinner.  Wow! It was absolutely delightful.  There are not enough nice things to say about the atmosphere, the service, and the food.  We were seated in a semi-private, quiet dining room (only 4 tables) near the kitchen.  The wine list was nice and included some really good mid-price options.  Our server, Rebecca, was a true professional.  She was always there when we needed her but never hovering or annoying.  When I couldn't decide between seafood and steak she recommended ways to put things together so I could get a taste of both.  I had the crabcake and a small filet. My husband had the Wagyu ribeye.  For our side dish, the crab and shrimp mashed potatoes.  For dessert we tried the crunchy banana split.  Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared.  We were stuffed even after we took some home.  This place is well worth every penny.  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Steak 44 for my son's graduation from ASU. It was a fantastic dining experience in every aspect. The service was exceptional as our server Sarah and her team anticipated and met our every need. And all the food, especially the beef, was amazing. My son had the NY steak and I had the Filet Mignon, which we both felt was the best we've ever had. My wife had the meatloaf, which was also amazing. Wine selection was very good. All in all the staff at Steak 44 made this a very memorable occasion."}
{"text":"Steak 44 is world class and stands tall above all other steak houses in Phoenix and Scottsdale. The wagyu beef and chef Watson's potato's are my favorites. The atmosphere is warm and the service impeccable. I always leave Steak 44 smiling!"}
{"text":"Business dinner December 2016.  Outstanding experience.  Excellent service and all food was outstanding.  I shared the wagyu tomahawk with another at our table and it was the best steak i have had in a long time.  We will definitely return the next time we are in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite steakhouse we've been to in the area so far.  I waited to write my review until we had been here a few times to make sure the restaurant is consistent. They absolutely are!   Every time we have come it's been a great experience with amazing service. They are extremely accommodating for special occasions or if you are just stopping in for a nice dinner. I highly recommend making reservations at least a week early because they book up quick. We still always end up waiting when we arrive but no longer than 5-10 minutes.    The food is amazing. The steaks are cooked perfectly every time and the sides are also very well prepared. I highly recommend the crispy shrimp appetizer. The flavor is unique and has a bit of a kick to it and then breading is amazingly crispy."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and wanted a nice steak dinner, so glad I picked this place! Both food and service were amazing! We ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer and it was delicious, a hint of spice and full of so much flavor. For dinner, we shared a 22oz bone in ribeye with sides of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, all delicious!"}
{"text":"Service always first rate.  Generous martinis.  Best bone in filet I have ever had.  I have been here many times and have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"The food is mostly good here. Filet mignon and Kansas City cut are phenomenal. Crab Mac n cheese and creme brûlée corn are my must haves from now on. I also liked the s'mores cup dessert.   Cons: Brussel sprouts were slightly burnt. Mixed drinks were super watery barely any alcohol... I'll stick to wine.   But overall I really liked it."}
{"text":"Wow! Impeccable dining experience. From out of town so relied on reviews for selecting a steak restaurant for a business dinner. Made reservations and was amazed at how busy the place got for a Thursday night. We were sat in a private booth that had a glass exposure to the kitchen. Service was very attentive and pleasant. Extensive wine list and amazing steaks - sides are large enough to share. Ambiance is dark with great light fixtures. Absolutely loved this restaurant."}
{"text":"A few words that first come to mind of Steak 44 is, awesome, stellar, classy. Now don't get me wrong, my husband and I don't usually patronize such high end establishments, we are middle class, happy with your neighborhood steak houses, but this place is on another playing level. The food is spectacular, the staff is prompt,courteous and don't make you feel like you don't belong there. Very patient and helpful, with suggestions of what drink would compliment the meal. The manager visited our table, and was genuine and made us feel so welcomed and he comped our dessert because it was my birthday. Granted it is a high priced menu, but well worth the splurge (even though our friend picked up the tab). We will definitely tighten our belts to have this experience again. If I could give more stars I would. Kudos Steak 44!"}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse! I take my husband somewhere exceptional for a good steak every year on his birthday. Last night, was Steak 44. Second on my list of favorites. Exceptional food, stellar service and the atmosphere is lovely. I'm older and it's a very happen-in' place so it got incredibly loud for me the later the hour got. This did not take away from the experience. Outstanding night. They called me just now to follow up to see how the evening was and to thank us for being there for our occasion. That's rare for me.  If you haven't been, go, it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I took my parents here after hearing the name mentioned a few times and we were not disappointed. My father who loves to eat at amazing steak houses considered his steak the best he has ever tasted! And trust me-- thats saying lot. The bone-in-filet was absolutely magnificent and I couldn't recommend any restaurant over this one.    If I could afford to come here daily I would."}
{"text":"Good food, not LA but good for Phoenix, service they try hard, but what is up with the shaved hair looking like a LA club want-a-be.  The people are mostly have no class, just there to pick up a cougar or want to feel like they are a member of one of  high end private clubs they can not afford.  If you are used to LA or NY restaurants avoid this \"TGI Fridays\" knock off."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and felt like we really hadn't had a good meal. We both wanted a good steak and a great steak, service, wine, ambiance is what we got. First let me say it was crazy busy but that made me feel like I made a great choice lol. I DID make a reservation because it was Friday. I tried to call and get in before my 845 reservation lol but they said that was my best bet. It was freaking worth it. they said they were running 10 to 15 behind on seating but we were seated right on time.   Ryan was our fantastic waiter. He was busy and flying back and forth but i never felt like he was too busy for us. I am a full 20% tipper and i did tip over 20 but i feel bad cause i think i should have done more lol. He was friendly and knowledgeable and attractive lol not like that has anything to do with anything. I just wanted to throw that out there. The food runner was great as well; i didnt get his name though. Our glasses were refilled when they hit half way. This is the kind of service I expected and I was not disappointed. When they boxed up all my food i told them to get ALL THE SAUCE lol and they did it.   my NY strip was amazing. The bread they bring is fluffy and great flavor. we got our bread half regular and half garlic herb.... just go full garlic herb! lol its great! on the menue it says \"get these!\" under the Brussel sprouts..... GET THEM! I had the lobster mac and cheese... it was good BUT i will say it is better at Capital Grille. However, S44 was nice a gooey with HUGE pieces of lobster.... they were NOT stingy :) i was pleased.I took everything to go lol. OMG AND if you have never heard about truffle butter spend the 5 bucks and get it lol... but listen to Drakes truffle butter song then go there and eat it and you'll be singing the song the whole time.   The ambiance is great and the decor is wonderful. I got some decorating ideas lol i love the chairs. I'm sad I was too full for dessert... and omg i just realized i didn't finish my wine... how rude. lol i was too focused on getting an Uber.   I'm excited to warm up my food in a few."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here at Steak 44, had never been before. Heard lots of good reviews from co-workers. Good thing this was a business expense, as the cost was beyond my regular eating out budget. But I would consider for special occasions.   We started with oysters, jumbo shrimp, and the pork belly. All excellent.  For dinner, there was a filter and lobster (surf n turf), two steak farina, and I had the Regular NY Strip Oscar. The table got very quiet when the food arrived. No one wanted to stop eating long enough to talk, it was that good!  S'Mores in a Jar, and the an apple cake special that was amazing.  All in all, a great experience. Great service as well. If you've never been here, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my only favorite steakhouses. I enjoy the atmosphere, the staff, the food and seeing the happy crowds. There's just something about this place you'll have to go check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Honey?  Can we talk?  Listen. I have to tell you something.  I'm pregnant.  With Steak 44's food baby.  Yes, I know I'm a vegetarian.  It's so wrong, it's right.  I've been side-eyeing this place since it and its greedy valet situation has pretty much rocked this entire corner. I do, however, appreciate the rotating display of ridiculous vehicles parked pretentiously out front and how they help me win the wintertime game of Luxury Car Bingo In The Desert. I'm shallow. It's okay.  My dad and I, feeling brave, actually put on non-denim pants and real shoes and ventured to Steak 44. We went early, sans reservation, fearing the crowds. We easily got seated in a big booth, ensconced by dividers, shielded from the abutting bustling kitchen by a glass wall so sparkling clean you could barely confirm its existence. No glass surface in my home has ever been or will be so spotless.   I started with the blood orange martini, probably the most I have ever paid for a single cocktail in my entire life. It was tasty in the way that Hawaiian Punch is tasty. I switched the to tart cherry martini, a wise move -- a complex and interesting drink with a heavy Luxardo cherry flavor. Meh or impressive, the martinis were big and accompanied by a hefty shaker filled with leftovers.  The hovering server, resplendent with some unidentifiable foreign accent, assured us the sides were enough to serve three to four. Because I was forgoing a pricey traditional entree, I picked a handful of veggie sides, while my dad opted for some medium rare 12 oz slab of moo. The roasted sweet potatoes and creamed spinach were okay, not knockouts, easily overshadowed by the glory of the creamed corn creme brûlée. I mean, incredible, amazing, custardy corn goodness. Just divine. The thin, curly, crispy onion strings were fluffy wisps of awesome, spilling over on the fancy white tablecloth. The veggie servings are massive and will easily feed me all weekend. My dad, who was all ready to hate the place, because it's all trendy and replaced his beloved Cork & Cleaver,  was forced to admit his steak was a perfectly cooked, excellent quality piece of meat. Out of principle, we split the butter cake, which was bizarre but good -- like a pound cake and cornbread had a baby. Not the high point of the meal, but good.   The service was excellent and almost over the top until the credit card slip was signed; then he was MIA. That's lame. The place is not cheap; it's best reserved for a special occasion. It seems to be drawing a big crowd now, but is it sustainable given the number of pricey steakhouses in the valley?   Time will tell; if 44 stays, I can eat my fill of corn creme brûlée whenever my whims see fit; if 44 goes, I get to park without circling the lot three times. All good; I win either way. Now, about that food baby -- it's due pretty soon."}
{"text":"Top-Notch steakhouse in Phoenix. Steak 44 sticks out to me over the Mastros and Ruths Chris of the area. The restaurant is dark, yet cozy and romantic. The servers are polite, a little snobby, but attentive. The steak.... oh man... the steak has rewired my brain to crave it the way addicts crave their drug of choice.   If you want to impress on a first date, celebrate a special occasion, or you just want to have one of the best steaks you can get in the state ..... Steak 44 will deliver a classy and delicious dining experience. Besides their great bovine meat selections they have incredible Oysters and seafood as well. The fish actually tastes fresh, compared to other places in the Valley at the same price. Desserts are also very well done, and help end a very rich and savory meal.  Obviously Steak 44 is a high end establishment, but it is for good reason. It epitomizes the saying \"You get what you pay for\". If you have been brain-washed and only think Mastros is the place to go in the Valley for a fancy steak, you are sadly missing out on a steak and restaurant that will out do them from start t finish.  TIDBIT: The music is very unique... Each time I have gone, the music will vary from Frank Sinatra to Garth Brooks to The Fugees and Michael Jackson. It is not off-putting in the slightest, but something fun to notice. The waiter explained it to us that the extreme variation of artists and songs, is to keep the employees going crazy hearing the same songs day after day."}
{"text":"They're not kidding when they say Super Colossal Shrimp on their appetizer menu. They are HUGE! The Chilean Sea Bass is out of this world. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. You won't be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"Went back again Thursday night, ordered the same meal.... Delicious!!! Wow!! Nothing more to say... Excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"Certainly one of the nicer steakhouses in the valley. The location is easy to find and the complimentary valet service is very convenient. The food is prepared perfectly and the portions are just the right size. I started with the BLT wedge salad and the blue cheese was delicious and creamy. Great wine list and amazing service from all staff. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLLY. This place is off the chain. From the service to the food, everything was awesome. It will be hard for any steakhouse to beat this place out. I had the 16oz Ribeye."}
{"text":"Every time I come in I'm always impressed. Waiters knowledge and recommendations are always on point. Top notch meal consistently.  Only thing I miss is the strawberry buttercake."}
{"text":"Maybe the best meal and experience I've had in my 6 years in AZ, Steak 44 delivers on food and service. Not only did they have unique dishes, a Tomahawk pork chop with not one but two chops, interesting sides which included delicious mushrooms, but also one of the best wine lists I've seen. The crowd is definitely upscale (note the Audi R8 and Rolls Royce parked out front, among other high end rides), but the bar area (where most people eat) has a great energy and was already hopping at 5:45! Whether in AZ for work or play, or you're lucky enough to live here, Steak 44 is a must experience."}
{"text":"I have been to many streak houses in my life all across the globe. This is the best one by far. The steak absolutely melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Perfection! Loved everything about my experience here. The ambience, customer service, and food all of the best quality. I even received a follow up call the next day to ask how my dinner was. Exceptional!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant we had the pleasure to eat at during our short visit to Phoenix. Though the prices are up there you absolutely get what you pay for. The variety and depth of the menu is unlike any other steak house I have been to. The drink menu is exactly on par with the food, offering pairings for every meal. The server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in navigating the menu and gave great insight into favorites and suggestions on drinks. If you are looking for a classy night out at a high end steak house, this is definitely the place to be!  Overall: Food was fantastic Drinks were great A perfect place to have one of the best steaks you'll ever have Only complaint is it was a tad darker in the living room which made it difficult to read the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite dessert is the ultimate warm vanilla caramel cake is to die for. The service is very prompt. Our waitress was very welcoming and kind. I went for my friend's birthday dinner, we told the waitress it was her birthday and she didn't do anything. Last time we came here for a birthday dinner the crew came out to sing Happy Birthday. Was a little disappointed that it didn't happen this time."}
{"text":"Stunning! This is one of the hottest spots in Scottsdale. Only recommendation is to open up the outside seating for those in the bar at least during Happy Hour. Otherwise, a great experience."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our fifth anniversary and the last 4 years have been at Mastro's and we decided to switch it up this year. Boy are we glad we decided to switch it up! What a great experience we had! From the moment we walked in to paying the bill, can't say enough good things about our experience. Service was excellent, food was excellent, ambiance was excellent and prices were very reasonable. Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - what a tasty treat!!!   Very glad I was on business so my tab was paid for (cheapest filet was 37 plus sides were extra) but you really get what you pay for.  And the bread they serve is phenomenal.  If you're up for a big bill for great food this is the place."}
{"text":"Very good not amazing the 500 degree plates are over rated. Remember to order your steak one level under how you want it as the plate will continue to cook it as you eat.   Nice Ambience the place is very beautiful wine is served at the appropriate temperature even by the glass which is hard to find. The appetizers we ordered were very good one salad and the avocado crab was amazing.  Stakes are high quality and seasoned ok not the best steak I've ever had though. Sides we're not as good as the description made them sound. Overall a good experience but for the money there are better steak houses out there."}
{"text":"Whether you're able to afford a visit to Steak 44 on a regular basis or not, it definitely worth the splurge. I came here with my boyfriend  for dinner and we had great food. The place is beautiful and all of the staff, especially our waiter Scott, were friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend the Alaskan King Crab and Rock Shrimp Mac & Cheese and the Effen Cucumber Mule."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. Best cooked steaks we have ever had and perfectly cooked sides and appetizer. I ordered the filet mignon, he ordered rib eye, both with lobster. We had the best mac and cheese ever with perfectly cooked broccoli. He fell in love with the pork belly appetizer. We had beignets for dessert which was paired well with dessert sauces. Great service as well."}
{"text":"The experience at Steak 44 was great for my husband and I.  We were in the mood for something special, not part of a chain, and the staff and food did not disappoint.  Jenna and the manager went above and beyond with great service and great food.  Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a friend's wedding from Orange County and dined here this past Friday  and I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised.  The rib-eye we split was phenomenal and cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  The food was great but the best thing was the service.  I believe our server's name was Travis and he was top notch.    The next morning I was already more then satisfied w/ our dinner here but the staff even called me see how our dinner went.  Little things like that is pushing customer service above and beyond.  If you're thinking of dining here I would wholeheartedly recommend that you try it.  Thank you for the great dinner guys."}
{"text":"Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Totally! This was one of the best steak dinners I've had in a long time!   My husband and I went to Steak 44 for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. It was a Sunday night and the place was packed! Good thing we had a reservation because there was not an open table in the place and there were a bunch of people in the lobby.  We were seated in a section that was just off the bar. I would have preferred more of the \"dining room\" area but considering how busy it was it was fine. Our waitress was great - very attentive, gave good suggestions and overall very friendly.  We started with the crispy shrimp. OMG. I couldn't stop eating it. So delicious. They also brought out warm, garlicy rolls. Again, delish.   For our main course we went with the poke and split a filet. They were nice enough to split it ahead of time and they even cooked mine a little longer than his so we each got it done the way we like it. The poke was super fresh and flavorful and the steak was done to perfection. For a side we got the hasselback potatoes. Just like everything else, they were fantastic. As if all this wasn't enough, for dessert we got the s'mores in a jar. It was - you guessed it - awesome. Just the right size for a taste of something sweet without being huge.  From beginning to end, the meal was outstanding. The next day they even called to thank us for dining with them - a nice touch, I thought. I think we found our new go-to for special occasions!"}
{"text":"What a sublime experience! Went there while on a business trip and they didn't disappoint. The meal was even better than Mastro's!"}
{"text":"I'm so in love. Crispy shrimp is amazing. Our table shared the 40oz steak tonight that was pure perfection. Love the staff. Love the ambience. Love love the food. Love the wine Napa Valley Quilt Cabernet Sauvignon"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place this restaurant is. Amazing staff, the food was great and everyone was welcoming. My sister was visiting from Australia and my parent's anniversary was last week and mom's birthday is next week. My sister missed the anniversary and would miss the birthday so I decided to bring them here. It was my second time here and they were as good as the first time if not better.   We started off with a nice bottle of Piatelli\"Reserve\" Malbec, and the wine is just smooth, earthy and just great. My father orders a glass of Hennessy. The Hennessy was late, when I asked the server Sean he apologized, grabbed the drink quickly and took care of it. Such wonderful service.   For our appetizers we got the Crispy shrimp with sweet Thai chili peppers and garlic aioli and with it we got the roasted bet salad. This was plenty for the 4 of us we shared a bit of the salad and dug in that shrimp dish, with the garlic bread that comes to the table complementary and it was heaven on earth. The garlic aioli and sweet Thai pepper flavors were infused with that shrimp, it simply was amazing.   For dinner mom and dad ordered the 12 once Filet Mignon and sister order the salmon and I got the 12 once NY strip. Parents like the meat well cooked and butterflied, I got mine medium well and sister got her salmon medium. All came out perfectly, the meat were amazing and fish was melting in your month. On the side we ordered the roasted bacon and Brussels sprouts, Mac and cheese (which was heavenly and my mom loved it) and a side of hand cut fries. The best meal ever we've had at a restaurant in a while.   The staff surprised us with a small bowl of ice cream with a message that read happy anniversary for my parents and a small warm  vanilla Carmel cake with a message and a candle that read happy birthday for my mom. Coffee and espresso were delicious and the desserts were out of this world. And the beignets were so good and delicious they come with vanilla and chocolate sauces.   I feel unfair in my description of their food and unfair with my words towards the staff, just because I can not describe how great everything is and wonderful, warm and welcome everyone has been. Thanks Sean, our server, the buss staff that made sure our plates and cutlery were clean and everyone there. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food. Great selection. This is a great place for a special occasion. If you are looking for a quiet part of the restaurant, I'd make sure to request that early. There are definitely places that are loud."}
{"text":"Steak was above average if you are comparing it to average restaurant. Good ambiance.  Great location.  However all salads (almost all) were weak and not as good as drinkwaters. Deserts were very disappointing. Sides were average. The creamed corn burlee side was the best corn dish I have ever had which raised this a star. I just think there are better high end steakhouses so for the price I have to give 3.5 stars. Service was pretty good. Waiter excellent and manager kind of not helpful when accommodation of a colleague request."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I am NOT a steak person. But, my boyfriend is. So, for his 25th birthday I brought him here to experience the finer things. Mind you, we have been to Donovan's, and we thought that was amazing. No disrespect towards Donovan's, but holy cow... this is #1 steak house in AZ, in my opinion. Their steak... prepared EXACTLY how you ask them for. Please early and take advantage of their \"early bar menu\" order their lemon drop martini. In all, this establishment is well worth it. Birthday or not, this is a must try! The only reason they received 3 1/2 stars and not 5... a Red Bull vodka should NOT be $20. I understand, this is a steakhouse. But, let's be honest a $20 Red Bull Vodka??? Mind you, it was Tito's Vodka, so shouldn't have been that pricey. Other than that... I will be returning, but already with a drink in me."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant ever. Everything is just TDF! The colossal shrimp is always fresh! The ribeye is the best I've ever had. I also highly recommend the crab Mac n Cheese and chef Watson's potatoes. Yummmm!  Exceptional service too every time!"}
{"text":"If you want a special night out, and you fancy a little read meat, or some seafood, this is the joint.  Absolutely fantastic!  My beau and I went on our anniversary and had an amazing time.  We wanted to sit at the bar, but it was crazy packed...on a Wednesday mind you.  Wow!!  Regardless, we were seated in a great booth and the waitress did a fantastic job allowing us to enjoy a pre-meal cocktail prior to ordering.  Everything was coursed perfectly.  Wonderful experience and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in town!! Service on point... best seafood... make sure you try the meatballs!!!  Yum yum on everything..."}
{"text":"Worth every dollar... Amazing ambiance, amazing service, amazing food!!!! New favorite steak house in Arizona. I got the filet, Brussel sprouts and lobster whipped potatoes. I was too full, but the dessert looked amazing. The table next to us got a tree full of beignets."}
{"text":"Drop the mic, this is the best steak house in Phoenix. Always love walking through the kitchen, old school. Ambience satisfies both those there for a quiet meal and those there for the social meeting place."}
{"text":"Alright so I heard this place is the same as Dominicks and Mastros.  Just hearing that raised the bar and my expectations. Let me start by saying the service and steak were really good.  Why they didn't get the same rating as Mastros is the appetizers, salads, and sides were not on the same level. Therefore I give it a solid Four Stars.  I might try it again."}
{"text":"It was decent. I came here expecting great but the service was a bit off and the food just above average. You can definitely tell they use lower grade steaks than the original Mastro's. Kind of like Dominick's. Good but something missing. Not gonna displace City Hall for me.."}
{"text":"I called to set a party of 9 and the girl was so rude to me that I booked elsewhere. I will make it a point to never go to 44, and express the same to my clients!"}
{"text":"Legit, this is the best restaurant in Phoenix. Probably the best place I have been to anywhere.  It is basically restaurant nirvana.  Incredible steaks, awesome drinks with great wine pours, and amazing service. My go to is martini followed by one glass of wine. For food, one shrimp ( they are huge) and then the rib eye with side of mushrooms. The great thing is that in addition to the highest quality they also maintain a super fun, festive and lively atmosphere of good times. They will always make you feel special and appreciated. Big shout out to my man John"}
{"text":"I was super fortunate to attend some soft pre opening festivities.. We were the first drinks served out of the bar! The space is absolutely gorgeous with the Mastro attention to appearance and detail throughout.. a stunning patio and bar area, and the restaurant is divided into many different little \"Areas\" giving a lot of different environments to dine in.. The food: We were some of the first food to be served out of the kitchen as well.. We charged our way though a massive sampling of dishes.. Chilled Seafood, Pork Belly, Ahi Tuna, Bone-in Ribeye, Lobster Tail, Bone-in Filet, Corn Crème Brulee (Too Die For) Au Gratin Potatoes, Mushroom, Scallops, Stuffing, Brussel Sprouts... Every dish was absolutely amazing.. Like they have been serving this food in this  kitchen for years.. Perfect temperatures, great flavors, and ultra premium ingredients. Desserts were playful, and a bit nostalgic.. Smores, Banana Split, Coffee and doughnuts.. The service was some of the best I have received in the Valley.. The server assistants were extremely attentive to table maintenance, Our server AJ was phenominal.. The prices are \"Get what you pay for\"  All in all.. real competition in the Arcadia Biltmore area  for Hillstone, The Henry, and Donovans.."}
{"text":"For a special occasion this restaurant was perfection. The server was so attentive and friendly and the food was incredible. I loved the calamari and filet. We had an amazing dessert that was a tower of cookies and cream popcorn over ice cream. Very unique. Most steak restaurants have similar menus but steak 44 really impresses and provides a twist in every dish. I highly recommend it for the ambiance as well. While a bit of a maze, every table feels private and the atmosphere is the epitome of cool. The final touch which really put them over 5 stars is that they called me the next day to ask hoe everything was. Who does that??? Only people who truly care about their customers and reputation."}
{"text":"Wow, what a phenomenal experience. Have you ever been to a restaurant and everything was executed flawlessly, like it was choreographed for the cinema?  This was like that. From greeting to ordering, all the way through the food and drinks...even to my dealings with the manager to comp a round of drinks for a business associate and his group of 20 in a VIP room, this went down like clockwork.  I had the 22oz Ribeye and it was MONEY, baby. Perfect medium...and the beef was probably the best quality I've ever had. I know my way around a cut of cow, and this was outstanding. The preparation was so good that, even though I ordered Bernaise on the side, I opted not to use it. One dip and I knew, the meat was so perfectly presented that the side sauce only detracted.  If you're in town, GO HERE. That's all I can think to say. Do it."}
{"text":"We just ate here last night for me and my husbands 3 year anniversary. And wow it was amazing. You can tell who ever owns this restaurant perfected ever detail about it. We went all out. For the appetizers we got the fried deviled eggs (the best ever) the sauce you dipped it in was perfect. Then we got the crispy shrimp with chilli sauce it was perfectly fried with the perfect amount of sauce on it. for the meal I got the meatloaf, and my husband got the rib eye. Those as well are fabulous. For our sides we got bacon Brussels sprouts which I'm not a huge fan of Brussels sprouts but even I liked them and my husband died over them. The lobster mac and cheese that was good but not my favorite. The Dominic's potatoes those are wonderful I definitely suggest those (had them for breakfast today almost better than last night!) and last but not least the cream corn and I dreamed about that last night. It was the best thing I think I've ever eaten. Ever. Our waiter Rob was so nice and you could tell he's been doing this for a long time because he was on top of it. He surprised us with the butter cake and had them write happy anniversary on the plate. That as well was mouth watering. We had a great time. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is so AWESOME!! Was referred to Steak 44 by a staff member of the resort I was staying at, best recommendation ever. Totally was not hungry when I arrived after pigging out all week but I devoured everything that was put in front of me. From the house bread to the pork belly to the shrimp cocktail (a must have) to my cooked to perfection steak to the last bite of butter cake, everything was awesome. Will definitely recommend and have already done so. Can't wait to get back to Scottsdale to hit up Steak 44!!"}
{"text":"Great find! We lucked into a last minute reservation here on a Friday night. Superb menu options. Very attentive wait staff. If you are looking for a white table cloth kind of dinner, this is the spot. I chose a Caesar salad with a soft boiled egg, filet with a side of sweet potatoes. The only complaint we had was the bus boy spilled water on my friends lap, the server dropped some noodles on the table, and the steaks were not all cooked exactly to order (some were a little over/under cooked.) But despite some human error this place still deserves 5 stars from their desserts alone. I was impressed with about 10 different choices. It was the hardest decision of the night with all the great options. I think it was impossible to make a wrong choice bc everyone at our table loved each bite."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a birthday dinner and we came back again 6 days later. This is officially my favorite steak place with the best steak & crab Mac and cheese.   Let's just say I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for my dad's doctoral degree celebration and we decided to try this place out (thanks to Yelp!). Our reservations were for 8:30 and we were immediately seated by our hostesses.   Ambience: dimly lit, very romantic vibe. Would definitely come back for an intimate date or even a business dinner.  Our waiter, Darrell (sp*) was amazing! Very friendly and helpful. It can be very hard serving a large indecisive group but he was a complete angel and got each and everyone of us exactly what we were craving.   Food: I got the 22oz bone-in Ribeye steak with the creamy Mac and cheese and asparagus as my sides. We also ordered crispy shrimp and calamari & shrimp for our appetizers. But first...let's get into the bread. The bread was SOOOOO good. Buttery, garlic goodness. I want that bread served at my wedding, birth of my first child, and funeral. That good. Piping hot too. Our appetizers were smack ya mama good. You know how sometimes you order calamari and it feels like you're chewing on elastic rubber bands? Not the case with Steak 44. So delicious. BUT. MY. STEAK. Listen, I don't know what kind of sorcery they have going on in Steak 44 but my steak was so tender, flavorful, crispy, and perfectly fatty. Oh my god. It was so good.   Random but I really hate when waiters are like \"be careful because the plate is really hot.\" And you touch it and the plate is cold....like your food. Well Steak 44 are some honest ppl because they're plates are served at 500 degrees (of course I stuck my finger on it to see if I was being lied to and burned it) lol. So the food is sizzling hot when it's put in front of you.   The reason this place doesn't score perfectly was the sides. They just weren't as good as I expected based off the rest of my food. Don't get me wrong they were good but not worthy of recognition."}
{"text":"everything was great!  The server was friendly and knowledgable, the food was great, the timing was perfect, and the manager Daniel came by our table to make sure everything was perfect.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"incredible and great to have a new setting for Dominick's deliciousness! I especially love the knife wall homage in the front, a great photo backdrop too! matt is the best waiter ever and I will always order anything he recommends because he just gets it!! everything was delicious and I would've never thought to get the fish oscar style before, it was a great selection!! I will come back and have to definitely request matt!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is ON POINT! I sat at the bar and John was my bartender, we had steak, lobster and  crab and avocado salad and ALL 3 items were phenomenal! Service was attentive and not one item was disappointing. Sorry Mastros, but you got some competition! Thanks John for your amazing hospitality, you made the experience even that more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent service; attentive but not smothered by wait staff. Filet was excellent, vegetables were good but not out of this world. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"My oh my what a place, Steak 44 is off the charts. They have EVERYTHING covered when it comes to service, quality, friendliness, amazing food and drinks! This was our first visit, we went on a Sat night with a 5:30 reservation. ( at first wanted a later time which wasn't available 5 days out, but we r glad we came when we did). Our servers, and table staff were awesome! My water was never empty, our table was refreshed with silverware each time a plate came. Can't even describe the amazing food, everything was so FRESH, the steak was perfect! Food temperature was fresh out of the oven.   If you haven't been, you truly r missing out. By far the best restaurant experience we have ever had. We are already talking about going back soon!"}
{"text":"An amazing experience with great service. An absolutely incredible experience.   It can't get better in my opinion. Jenna was an amazing server.  Her professionalism and courteousness, willingness to walk is through the menu screamed Manhattan fine dining.   The experience she facilitated as steward brought me and my group the best steakhouse experience we have had.  Business travelers don't miss it."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Phoenix! We came here for a celebration and had the best service!! The courses were amazing. The steak was cooked perfect! The dessert choices were excellent. There was not one part of dinner we did not love. Great host staff, bartender, server and server assistants. Manager made his way to our table to introduce. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The other reviews tell the story and so will the pictures I posted. Boujee restaurant.  Worth every penny, er dollar."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and think this teaks house is right up there at the top. I started with the tomato, feta and baby arugula salad, then some of the best dinginess crab piece you will get anywhere and finished it off with one of the best bone in filets I have ever had. They have great meeting rooms off the kitchen where're you can watch the chef's at work and the service is always impeccable. The bar is hopping if that is your kind of thing, but can be a little loud."}
{"text":"The best steak I have had in years.  I had an 8oz filet and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  Unbelievable.   The deviled eggs and pork belly appetizers were equally delicious.   We had the Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts and creme' brûlée sweet corn.  Everything about this place was perfect."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for date night! The ambiance of the place is great. It's a dressy kind of place but at the same time not very stuffy. It's a relaxing place to dine with amazing food(rib eye steaks, shrimp apps, burrata, beignets just to name a few favorites) with equally great drinks. Their wine selection seems endless."}
{"text":"So the upscale suburban super trendy steakhouse is not really my scene but was invited by a local and wasn't about to argue - walking in my concerns seemed well founded - not that Steak 44 doesn't look nice - it looks great but the high energy loud (like really loud) next to the bar high top seating seemed to confirm my assessment  that Steak 44 is a bad rift on Ruth's Chris - I could not have been more wrong.  Now Steak 44 - especially if you sit next to the bar - is loud and our very nice waitress even commented that hearing orders can be tough but that's the scene and if you not down with it go somewhere else - again not my fave but after a few minutes you settle in for the experience.  The service was great with the small exception of losing our waitress for a bit after we had ordered appetizers and we didn't order dinner for at least an hour after we sat down - wasn't really an issue but it did make for a three hour dinner.  Steak 44 has daunting selection of cocktails - my wife went with the Basil Cucumber Limeade at the suggestion of our server and said it was very nice - I a short but effective selection of beers kept me happy.  Prior to ordering apps a skillet of fresh baked rolls was delivered to the table and I began to get the idea that Steak 44 was cut from a different cloth - elevating a simple dinner roll is a great sign and I could have consumed the entire skillet full of these buttery soft yeasty rounds of bready goodness and yes I added even more butter.  We listened to our server on the starters and again not disappointed - the Fresh Burrata was four (i think) balls of the silky soft mozzarella relative with a just firm shell encasing the smooth creamy interior cheese and with just a touch of the tomato jam it was a great start to the meal - only critique would be the crackers served with (while good on their own) didn't hold up to the spread of the cheese - maybe something with more body - but I would total get the app again.  Also ordered the Shrimp - four perfect shrimps were very good but the make your own cocktail sauce pushed them over the top - my friend didn't warn me - which was fine and funny - but know that the horseradish (was it Atomic??) will absolutely light you up - in a good way.  In addition to the steaks you would suspect - Steak 44 offers a  large array of seafood and that was my direction until I was advised to not overthink this (I do) and go with the steak and while I am sure the seafood is outstanding after eating the steak I can not argue.  I went petite filet while my wife tried the New York Strip and I would highly recommend both - charred, medium rare - delivered with a warm red center exactly as order on a smoking hot plate - both were basically carnivore perfection.  I supposed people order the \"regular\" size but honestly the 12 oz strip and 8 oz. filet were plenty especially given the sides. And about the sides - remember when I mentioned elevating over that standard - that was all three - a creamy spinach that feature three (seriously three) cheeses and Watson Potatoes with more cheeses in little square of potato heaven and Shishito Peppers that were blistered with sea salt and parm - you could make a fantastic meal out of their sides.  So we were completely stuffed - the apps, the steaks, the sides so of course we order dessert.  If you go to Steak 44 and do not get the Ultimate Warm Vanilla Caramel Cake you have erred in the most egregious manner - it is a decadent combination of cake served warm in its own little crock aside a mountain of airy (almost whipped cream) gelato - once combined it brought tears of dessert happiness to my eyes (pro tip - bourbon neat makes it even better).  So walked in dubious - left super impressed - services was great and while not cheap (especially the drink prices) the value seems commiserate with the quality of the experience."}
{"text":"I wish there were 10 stars to rate this absolutely delicious, upscale, fabulous dining restaurant. Their food is IMPECCABLE!! From the steak served at over 500 degrees right out of the oven, to the abundant portions of sides and desserts. The staff are more than accommodating. From the beet salad to the short ribs and crab legs, EVERYTHING is beyond delicious. I am in love with Steak 44"}
{"text":"Food was unbelievable. The waiter and staff could not have been more attentive. Filet mignon was the best I've ever had, and I've been to many high end steak houses. I liked Steak 44 better than Capital Grill, Fleming's and Ruth's Chris. Price was average in comparison to other high end steak restaurants. Highly recommend, can not say enough good. Steak 44 even followed up the next day with a courtesy call to check how our dinner was."}
{"text":"Our waitress was really nice. Helpful with my wife's allergies issues.  We both has steaks and they didn't disappoint. Hot plates and delicious sides.  Table next to us sent back the scallops twice, but in all fairness, she seemed hard to please. We felt sorry for her date. Only downfall was that the seating in the area I was at was pretty tight and overcrowded."}
{"text":"Too Many Flaws for the Price  My husband and I decided to go to Steak 44 for the first time to celebrate our 31st anniversary.  Although the steak was amazing and cooked to perfection, the rest of the dinner was mediocre.  Just a few things which will make me reconsider before coming back (mind you, our dinner was over $300 for the two of us) ... so I expected absolute perfection.  It started with when we were trying to decide on our wine.  To have so many wines to choose from (well over $75 each), the servers should have some knowledge of the wine selections or at least a sommelier to assist the guests.  Our server didn't have a clue as to what to suggest and we had to \"gamble\" with our choice.  Fortunately, it turned out to be a good wine.  Then my appetizer, which was a crab claw on ice.  It was cracked so much that I ended up eating small pieces of shell and having to spit some out ... it was a mess and for $20 for this one claw!  I was expecting a perfectly shelled claw ready for dipping into the various sauces that they had.  Lastly, and the most disturbing part of our evening, was when my husband lifted the wine bottle to see how much was left in the bottle.  Our server was at the table next to us and he glared at us as if we did something wrong and even commented about our touching the wine bottle to the table next to us!  Really?  This is OUR wine and if we want to lift it up, we certainly can do so!  Even though we had 2 servers, one was handling our table more than the other.  Unfortunately for us, we ended up with the server who was not as efficient or trained and was just not up to our expectations especially for such a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"It was really fancy and pretty the workers were super nice, i went with a big group and it was little cray cray but overall the food was soooooo good"}
{"text":"My wife is a recently recovered vegetarian and has been delving into the world of steaks.  It was her birthday so I made us reservations here. I mentioned it was her birthday in the reservation notes section of their online system.  We arrived about ten minutes late, yet were seated immediately. The place is nicely decorated and has a modernistic style to it. We were sat by a window, and it was a nice table. We were seated at approximately 6:10pm and the restaurant was busy, but not overcrowded. The noise level was faint, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation. This was refreshing since most places seem to be noisy these days.  Our waiter (which I regret not getting his name so that I could mention it here) was very friendly, and joked around with us. He was personable and fun. There were also several \"floaters\" refilling water, taking plates, etc. Everything service was handled efficiently and politely.  We both ordered Petite Filets. We shared the Mashed Potatoes and Mac and Cheese.   The food was excellent, and delivered quickly. Both steaks were prepared properly and quite flavorful. The mashed potatoes were excellent, as was the Mac and Cheese. The serving size was more than we could eat. Overall the food was excellent, and compared to other places I have had similar, the pricing was right on-par.  We were going to order dessert, however the waiter brought out their signature dessert with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate. That was unexpected and quite pleasant. The dessert was Strawberry/Vanilla ice cream on their Butter Cake. It was excellent. I would have gladly paid for it, but they served it free of charge for the occasion.  We both had ice teas, and the total bill excluding tip was ~$107 dollars. I felt this was right in line with the quality of service, food, and experience.   We will definitely return, and were quite pleased with Steak 44."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent.  I consider it the best steak place in town.  Originally had low expectations bc it can be a scene and thought it would lack substance.   Food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 5 year anniversary here. We were visiting from Ca. And went off their Yelp reviews. We were extremely impressed, the service was on key, the food was amazing. I have never been to a restaurant where every single bite felt like the first . Our steaks never cooled down it was simply delicious. Not only were out steaks cooked to perfection, but our Moscow mules were the best we have ever had.   Our dessert ( given to us) for our anniversary unfortunately was completely burnt but you can't complain about something that was given to you for free.. My only complaint was being at such a nice restaurant on a special night I would have wanted the manager to have greeted us and ask how our experience was ., he did greet every single table in our dining area but us.. A little disappointed however we do realize it was a Friday night and they were busy!!  I can't wait to come back again when we visit Az again!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this place was amazing. The appetizers were the best. The deviled eggs and Mac and cheese, yum. Steaks of course were tremendous. Servers are quick."}
{"text":"Amazing! I am here in Arizona for a conference and had a craving for steak. It's certainly a pricey restaurant but wonderfully yummy! I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting superb service and a unique atmosphere coupled with delicious food."}
{"text":"got a recommendation for steak 44 while i was dining at the capital grill a couple weeks back.  dude at the bar said it was super swanky...this was certainly true when i visited last night right after landing from sf.  there's valet out front - with a selection of mercedes parked for show. i was dining by myself, so i parked at the bar and quietly observed my surroundings. it's very reminiscent of mastro's - huge bar area that also includes high tops for casual dining and walk-in's.  there are a couple of dining rooms available according to your party size, as well as a patio if you like the illusion of being outside in 108 degree weather. im not a steak person, so i naturally order the crab cakes ($39) and brussel sprouts ($10). cocktails are priced at $18, so i went with a nice pilsner ($7). truly swanky steakhouse prices! they served homemade dinner rolls seasoned with garlic and salt that are fluffy and delicious - this might have been the favorite of the evening. the crab cakes were a bit mushy; the brussels had HEAVY bacon lardons - a lot of them, which i didnt eat at all, but the brussels were good (and drenched in oil).    i definitely prefer mastro's over this joint."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, and great service, however... - the music was too loud that our birthday party of 6 couldn't talk with each other!  The reason a group gathers for dinner is for CONVERSATION...not loud music.  This spoiled our time together.  We asked if they would turn it down and it never happened. - there was little to no selection of healthy nutritious food!  Everything was laden with saturated fat.  Cream and butter on everything. - The one salad that was recommended - the Chop - had wilted iceberg lettuce cut into 1/4\" pieces.  It was not a crispy 'raw' salad.  Disappointing for someone who doesn't eat animal protein and just wanted a healthy salad. - The PRICES!!! Yikes!  This dinner for 6 was close to $1000.  Everything was a la carte which made for an extremely expensive meal for one if you wanted anything other than just meat. We dine out regularly and hit fav's like Hillstone, Henry, Tarbells, etc, but will NEVER go here again.  This place will surely go out of business with this menu, prices and loud ambiance. The wave of now is based on the latest scientific information about the best diet for human beings and it is nothing that was served here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great steak dinner in the valley, look no further. My wife and I come here a few times a year to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries or just bring out of town guests for a superb meal.   Go ribeye or go home, ha."}
{"text":"One of the best steak houses I have ever been to. A most when visiting Phoenix. Either for business or romantic dinning. Staff were friendly and efficient. Good wine list and definitely get dessert!"}
{"text":"Slam dunk!  I was in Scottsdale on business and checked in on a weekday night.  They were very busy, but the service was on point and very attentive.  The server was very knowledgable about the menu as well.  We had the steak and some seafood along with some apps and interesting sides.  Everything was cooked and prepared to perfection."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant!  One of the top places in Phoenix to eat.  The raw bar is amazing!  We enjoy the décor and atmosphere in this restaurant!  Our favorite dish is the bone-in filet!  The cream corn in this restaurant is the best that I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak! A little bit noise the place but the service was great. Meat apart, everything else was less expensive than North.... Wine included"}
{"text":"As I mentioned in my previous review, I knew I'd be back at Steak 44 soon after my first visit. Thank you, thank you, to this awesome restaurant for helping me celebrate my 21st bday with my family! Food was perfect as usual, drinks were on point (woo hoo!), and we all loved our waitress.   The ONLY downfall of the night was the squishy table we were put at. Seemed really difficult for the wait staff to get in between our table and the one next to us - and I felt really bad that my father had constant traffic behind his chair. We will have to reserve further in advanced next time! I also do have to say, after sitting back and watching, props to them for making the best out of the situation. Their staff works so incredibly hard and does it with a smile on their faces! I truly believe this is a big part about why an evening spent there is so fun and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! Service was excellent and desert-red velvet pudding  was phenomenal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"WOW.  I would consider moving to Phoenix just to eat here more often.  I was in town for a conference and in the mood to take a break from hotel buffet food.  When I did a little researching (thanks Yelp), I found out about Steak 44 and jumped into my Uber.    From start to finish, this was one of the best meals I have ever had.  Service was top notch.  The entree (bone in filet) was out of control good.  Perfectly seasoned.  The sides that I shared with a co-worker (creamed spinach, baked potato, mac n cheese) were all pretty amazing.  The potato was the size of an NFL football, the creamed spinach was steaming hot, and the mac n cheese had a nice crumble on top and lots of flavors.  We were so full that we skipped dessert, but the passing plates almost made us regret not busting our seams that night.    I can not recommend Steak 44 enough.  Whether you are passing through Phoenix like I was or live down the street, do yourself a favor and sit down for a meal here."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Steak 44 twice now and neither time has disappointed! We've had several things on the menu from the raw bar seafood tower, to the wedge salad, steaks, and deserts. We haven't had one thing that wasn't delicious. Particulary, the 22 oz ribeye is no question the best steak I've had. The sides of mushrooms, potatoes Dominick, and corn creme  brulee were all excellent. Lastly, the chocolate chip brioche bread pudding and vanilla cake are totally worth splurging for desert. I particularly love the bread pudding and even my in laws who aren't crazy about sweets couldn't resist the deserts.   In regards to the service and atmosphere, they are very good. The first time we went our server was Adam. He was excellent in describing everything on the menu, answering questions,  and truly treating us like VIPs. Tonight we had another server who was somewhat absent and didn't offer much in explanation (that is the main reason for a 4 star rating rather than a 5). However, Adam happened to be working and remembered us as he was serving another table and stopped to talk with us for a moment. He remembered everything about  our previous dining experience from the wine we order to the deserts. He noticed our wine glasses we getting low so he stopped to fill them (even though we weren't his table) and we mentioned that our server hadn't been around in awhile so he went on to fill all of our drinks and help serve our meals. For desert we ordered the bread pudding and received the vanilla cake as well. When we told them we didn't order the vanilla cake they told us it was from Adam. Adam honestly provided us the best service we have ever had, and did so twice. I strongly recommend that you ask for him when you go.   I also would recommend asking to be seating in the quieter dining area (behind the wall dividing the entrance and the on the way to the raw bar). Tonight we sat in the dining area by the bar and it was a little loud and crowded for what you think of for an expensive steak dinner.  Lastly, just a forewarning, be prepared to spend around $80-$100 per person if you get wine, appetizers, steaks, sides, and a desert. It is definitely worth it, I just don't want anyone to go and be shocked."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my boyfriends birthday, the environment and the food was good, but nothing outstanding. I personally thought our experience at Dominick's was better overall. Our server was super nice, but super pushy trying to get us to buy more and add more. (I'm a server so I know the difference between recommendations and when it's being overdone.) I'm guessing it was just because we didn't order any alcohol. Our table wasn't very nice for a special occasion and we were in later when there were plenty of empty tables available. It was a two-chair table, to the right was a wall, to the left was a window facing an outside wall and behind my chair was a server station which we got to hear the servers talking about who's going to be closing and who made money and who didn't. My boyfriend loved his food (Ribeye). I liked the Short Rib, the bordelaise sauce was really good. Not a huge fan of the asparagus fries, a bit soggy. Unfortunately the busser forgot to put the box with my boyfriends steak in the to-go bag so that was a little disappointing when we went to eat our leftovers. The restrooms are very clean and I like that its a one private room. We also got a courtesy call the next day which was a good touch for business. Too bad we didn't notice our steak was missing before they called! :("}
{"text":"This steakhouse was a phenomenal dining experience. Every dish I tried was absolutely flavorful and delicious! I had a petite filet for my main course and it was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The sides were all quite tasty too. We shared the mushrooms, asparagus, lobster mac n cheese and truffle fries. Great ambiance, nicely decorated and a lovely dining experience!"}
{"text":"My bf and I went here about 7 months ago and everything was perfect. We went back again tonight and don't know what happened.  The caesar salad was bland, the shrimp was overcooked and extremely fishy, and the mashed potatoes were tasteless. My petite filet was just okay.   But the real issue of the night was the service. Our waitress left our glasses empty 30 minutes at a time and had awful table management skills. She passed our table multiple times and didn't take note of our glasses or our plates. We sat waiting...and waiting...and waiting for everything. Just getting our bill back took 20 minutes.   The only good parts were the brussels sprouts and my bf's NY strip. But that's it. They also used to serve this amazing butter cake dessert, which I found out tonight they took off their menu. It was a fitting end to our disappointing evening. We left feeling deflated and agreed that we probably won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I frequented the previous restaurant that occupied this space so I was looking forward to the new venue. beautiful building, excellent service. I ate at the bar and the staff was extremely attentive. I appreciated an experienced bartender than can and is allowed to \"free pour\" the wine. I had the 12 ounce filet which was priced fairly @ $46.00 prepared very nicely and served on a very hot plate. The bread was exceptional, my only disappointment were the sides. The sauteed mushrooms were bland, soft and no real flavor, the corn was similar , soft, and very bland. I will definitely be back I liked the feel of the place and the sides can be enhanced."}
{"text":"Can't beat their steaks! As a matter of fact everything we had, salmon, sea bass, steak, they were all pleased as punch! Beignet tree was a lovely desert. Gotta try this place, it's our third time and we always leave with a smile!"}
{"text":"Very good amazing service and dinning experience. Worth every penny I enjoyed my steak and wine."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Sunday evening. It was busy, but not crazy. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive... Making sure we had everything we needed. The food was amazing!! They serve these buttered and seasoned rolls while you're waiting for your food... They are \"to die for\"!! I had the filet mignon and it was prepared to perfection!! I also had the brussel sprouts and the loaded baked potato. The food is served \"family style\" as opposed to being served on your plate. For example, my plate had the filet only. The sides were in small dishes, to be shared with others at the table... You simply scoop out the amount you wish to eat. Very interesting...  it is pricy though! Two filets, and two sides, two bottles waters and two cocktails were $162."}
{"text":"World Class experience! My boyfriend and I dined at Steak 44 last night  and had a great time with phenomenal food and service. We had a reservation but arrived about 30 minutes early and were seated right away(first brownie point TYSM). We ordered a dozen oysters, half east coast and half west coast, they were delectable and fresh! The presentation was just beautiful.  I preferred the west coast although they are more \"earthy\" than the east coast, just a heads up. We then ordered a bottle of Loveblock Pinot Noir which was decently priced. I was pleasantly surprised the server (Stephanie) was able to explain  the background behind the wine brand, very impressive as the wine list was vast.  For mains, I ordered a bone in filet and it was cooked PERFECTLY and served sizzling. We opted for the seafood mac n cheese and asparagus for sides and those were added to our sizzling plates. The aroma was mouthwatering but not overpowering. Beware of your first bite, it will be scorching. We skipped dessert but I'm sure it's amazing. Everything about this place is phenomenal but the amiable staff is what set this steakhouse above any other in Phoenix. I can't wait to visit Steak 44 again! Well done!"}
{"text":"Overall GREAT experience at Steak 44. Elegant and romantic atmosphere so it's perfect if your looking for a great restaurant for a date night. The staff was extra friendly, very professional and knowledgeable on the menu and wine selections.  After ordering, like most restaurants, they bring out a dish of bread. I probably could've eaten all 4 of these little heaven sent buns to myself!  I ordered a filet mignon cooked to medium and served on a extra hot plate to keep the fresh off the grille taste. It was perfect! A side of Dominick's potatoes completed the order and they were amazing. Could not stop picking at them even after being full!  I'll definitely be coming back here again for another dinner.... And hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Decor and layout of the booth was admirable. Service was great and accommodating.    I'm impressed that they left me a voice message the day after thanking me for coming in with my group.  That's the first from a fine steakhouse!   I had the staff recommend a wine for me that wasn't Napa county since it's close to me, a sweet Pinot and it had to have a cork for me to keep!  They have a variety of wine that starts from the fifties to a grand.  A grand - I was surprised. They met all that criteria I wanted from my wine after some thought and time.    The Wagyu Filet was the best filet that I have ever had that was a wagyu steak!  Medium rare is how it is done my way!  Always!  Superb taste.  Add on the side tasty potato and call it a fulfilling, treasured meal!  They tossed in cookies for the complimentary end.    I had a fine dining time here!    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. We are in awe. The steak melts in your mouth. The fois gras and truffle butter are next level. Combine it all together and you are on Cloud 9. Seriously, we've dined all over the world and this is one of the very best dining experiences we've ever had. Hands down."}
{"text":"Was recommended being better than Maestros and Ruth Chris. They did not disappoint. We were nervous to bring our 1 1/2yr old here but the room manager made us feel so comfortable and mentioned they could rush any order for our son & provided a styrofoam cup for his drink.  The steak was perfect, 2xs baked potato perfect, I'm still thinking about the creme brûlée cream corn.  We were joined by a large local bowling league-the Arizona Cardinals. Really nice guys who gave my son fist bumps. Go here for dinner. You will love it."}
{"text":"Seriously, Steak 44 has some of the best beef I've had in a long time. Add the swanky atmosphere, superb service and delicious sides and desserts to that and you have a fun and mouthwatering night!  After poring through each delicious item on the menu (I seriously wanted one of each, can I just order a whole cow and work my way through?) I was intrigued by the steak farina. I like steak, I like eggs, so I should like steak with egg on top, especially if it's a 28 day aged bone in filet mignon! I also got the corn creme brulee as a side to complete my meal. As for appetizers, we shared the crispy shrimp.  The complimentary bread we had was delicious. It had a savory buttery top with very soft dough. The shrimp came next and were fried perfectly, with a light crunchy batter and just the right amount of sauce, with a little bit of heat from the chiles.   I absolutely loved the steak farina. The filet was a sight to behold, a perfectly cooked medium-rare, gustatory delight. It was very tender and well seasoned. The actual meat had so much flavor which is impressive since I've oftentimes found filet mignon to be very tender but not taste as good as ribeye. It makes me wonder how much more flavor their ribeye has if the filet is that good! The egg on top was a perfect sunny side up, and provided some creaminess to the earthy, primal taste of the beef. Forget ordering food a la mode, I want all my meals to be a l'oeuf now!  The creme brulee corn was not bruleed that much but it was sweet, creamy, rich and indulgent, a perfect side to go with the beef and egg.  Service was impeccable and everyone was working together to make our dining experience enjoyable. A manager even came over to make sure we were happy with our meal.   Since we were celebrating a birthday they brought out a special warm vanilla cake with gelato and sliced pecans on top. Oh so good. We were so stuffed by the time we were finished here!  Even the bathrooms are super swanky and posh. This is the first bathroom I've seen that has its own dedicated hat rack.   So for some of the best steak and service around, Steak 44 is a 100 in my book!"}
{"text":"I'm glad we tried Steak 44 but we won't be going back.  First off we had a 7pm reservation on a Wednesday night.  We waited 20 minutes for our table and were seated at 7:20pm.  I couldn't believe how crowded the bar was, they must have a good happy hour.  It was our anniversary and a lady walked by us and tossed a card on our table which was an anniversary card.  Very nice gesture although the delivery was horrible.  The shrimp cocktail was amazing as was the corn crème brulee.  I had the filet mignon and my husband had the KC strip steak.  Both steaks were good but doesn't compare to City Hall, Capital Grill or Flemings.  We were finished with dinner and had to wait about 20 minutes until our waiter came by to get our food and give us our bill.  Since it was our anniversary they wanted to give us a complimentary desert, which was very nice.  We were so full though so he said he would give us one to go. Our bill was given back to us and he said goodbye.  He never brought us the desert so we decided to leave since we were so full anyways.  About 10 minutes into our drive home they called us to tell us our desert was ready if we wanted to pick it up.  The experience overall was a bit weird and not the level of service we were expecting."}
{"text":"WOW! Seriously, WOW.   Living in the Biggest Little City I though we knew steak well and steakhouses even better. Having now been to Steak 44, all I can say is that we have a long way to go.   Ended a business trip wanting some delicious high protein dinners and asked the bellman at our hotel for a recommendation. He suggested this place and boy are we glad he did.   From the extremely tender and succulent Thai chili flavored pork belly, to the juicy New York Strip to the 2 rib eyes cooked to perfection at the table, everyone was pleased.   One of my guests is actually the pickiest man this side of the Mississippi and even he had 0 complaints! Both rib eyes were cooked beautifully with one prepared black and blue, not an easy feat.   Only thing that wasn't utter perfection was the poached eggs on the Caesar salads were overdone and closer to hard boiled. But the entrees and service overcame it.   One of the best features is that this isn't your momma's steakhouse. It's young, hip, has excellent music and a great crowd. It's also sectioned off to allow for more intimate settings.   Hoping Reno lands something like this in the near future!"}
{"text":"This establishment is amazing! So, for an appetizer we got the Fried Devil Eggs...omg...they are heaven sent. The Sriracha Mayo that was with them was awesome!   On to my entree...I had a Filet Mignon that was like Butter it was so tender. It came out sizzling hot and melted in your mouth!   Steak 44 is now in my top 5 for best steakhouses!"}
{"text":"I had never written a yelp review prior to this, but wanted to take the time to recognize this restaurant.   A group of 9 of us dined here as part of a bachelor party weekend and everything about our experience was exceptional.  Excellent food, service, and atmosphere! Best steakhouse I've ever been to. Highly recommend Steak 44 next time you're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Ok so this great new place opens right by us and I was so hoping it would be good. Well it is AWESOME. Amazing food but really the services puts it above all the rest of the ice places. They go way out of their way to make you enjoy."}
{"text":"The steakhouse is top-notch. Incredibly and I mean INCREDIBLY special. The food is 10 out of 10, the service is 10 out of 10. White glove service, literally. We went on Mother's Day and just felt overwhelmingly special, the next special occasion will be spent here, if you travel from out of town, VISIT!  Again, we went on Mother's Day which was fine to bring children but wouldn't recommend on any other day since the restaurant is romantic."}
{"text":"One of the best fine dining establishments I have ever been to. The ambiance is spectacular along with superb service, Nicole was our server along with help from Perry. I had the bone in rib eye with a lobster tail and the wife had a filet with crab legs, this place was way beyond our expectations of food and service. The Dominic's potatoes are a must have as a side and enough to split with others."}
{"text":"Been to steak 44 many times and as usual it was fantastic . Great service ,great food and killer place to dine in Arizona.  Thumbs up every time We go.  Can't go wrong.  Great job to the staff"}
{"text":"Great looking, cool kind of jazzy looking place. Sat at the bar with a business associate. Food was excellent. I had a perfectly prepared Pittsburgh style, medium rare Bone-In New York Strip. Had a web salad, good blue cheese dressing and crisp lettuce. Brocolli was crisp and not over cooked. The best part was our Server, Amanda... Knowledgeable, funny as hell and efficient.  Oh and a great wine list."}
{"text":"This restaurant provides TENDER loving care to each of its guests. Yeah, let that one sink in.   I absolutely LOVED this place. The atmosphere is definitely upscale, but I felt extremely comfortable in the restaurant at the same time.   We started off with the fried deviled eggs, which had a delicious spicy dipping sauce. The way these were prepared was fantastic and unlike any deviled eggs I have eaten before. My boyfriend who hates deviled eggs scarfed them down.   Next they provided a fluffy, mountain of bread which one could easily fill up on and be completely content with the evening.   My boyfriend ordered the heirloom tomato salad, which we had no idea was just a sliced up tomato. It was good, but this was the one thing that didn't not blow me away. My suggestion would be to select a different salad, or just skip the salad and go for more meat. Because. Meat.   We were so #blessed to enjoy a ribeye AND a tuna steak. The ribeye was cooked perfectly and I coated it with truffle butter, which is a must. The tuna steak had an amazing dipping sauce as well.   Yes to all desserts. Yes to everything.   I was so impressed by our server, who knew it was our anniversary and brought us a delicious caramel dessert. After being completely full, he brought us some chocolate chip cookie bites to just explode. Finally, the manager stopped by to check in on us to make sure we had the perfect meal.   Please. Go here."}
{"text":"Ask for Brian to be your server. He will not stir you wrong. A++++"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service! Great atmosphere and beautiful decor. A definite must if you're in the area. Everything was very very good!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for special occasions. My husband and I have never had better steaks. The cream corn brûlée is the best side in my opinion & the service is so focused, devoted and adds to the perfection of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the king crab, lobster Mac and cheese and bone in ribeye steak....and WOW!!!  Best Mac and cheese on the planet!  As the ribeye was the best I've ever tasted and I've lived Louisiana and Texas!!!  Doesn't get better..."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary and sooo thankful I listened to the yelp reviews! My fiance and I ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer, NY strips with asparagus and the wild mushroom sides, and the vanilla cake. You are given garlic bread for free along with mini chocolate chip cookies towards the end of your dining. Every dish we ordered was delicious! Sides are definitely good to share. 1 side can be shared between 3-4 hungry people. The crispy shrimp had the right amount of kick and touch of garlic. The bread was soft, served fresh. Service was phenomenal and  fast! Zero complaints! This restaurant is dim with candle lighting therefore very romantic! Great place to go for fine dining!"}
{"text":"We love this place, it's consistent with outstanding food quality and stellar customer service. The Mastro family knows how to put a crew together and they have scored a gem with Steak 44. Crispy Shrimp appetizer is our favorite, but we have literally tried them all and have never been disappointed. Chilean Sea Bass is my hands down favorite entree and the bone in ribeye is my husband's. When with a group we love indulging with a personalized seafood tower, you can never go wrong!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best steakhouse I have ever been too! Delicious.. well worth the money for a nice anniversary dinner. I started out with an Italian blood orange martini with was beautiful and flavorful. They brought us complementary bread rolls with garlic Parmesan seasoning. We ordered the braised pork belly for an appetizer, it was sweet and spicy very tasty. For entrees we a 22 oz bone in rib eye with truffle butter and on the side a double whipped baked potato with truffles and a 12 oz bone in filet also with truffle butter and a side of sweet creamed corn which the brûléed it was fantastic. They bring out the steaks on 500 degree plates sizzling and hot! Both steaks came out cooked to perfection at medium rare. For desert we had a warm vanilla Carmel cake topped with sugared pecans and vanilla gelato.   The service was exceptional. We got a seat right by the kitchen. It was fantastic. I Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an above average  steakhouse experience."}
{"text":"We know good quality steak.  They do not have that here.  What they do have is good decor and a nice layout.  Dinner was awful, due to the subpar quality of the meat.  Also not recommended for people with food allergies as I requested gluten free and they put large pieces of toast on top of my shrimp.  The waiter and all staff we encountered seemed good except of the disconnect between my order and what I actually received.  Expensive."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary date. We were seated and greeted promptly. Waitress was very informative and provided good service throughout the night. Food was amazing. Everything was cooked perfectly. Beautiful restaurant but music didn't feel like it fit the atmosphere. Overall, great place for a good steak and nice date."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in Phoenix .  Classic menu-  giant shrimp, prime steaks and excellent service.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Steak 44 for my 44th Birthday on a recommendation by a friend. We arrived prior to 6pm without a reservation as we wanted to experience the bar which is open seating. I was impressed. This place is top notch in every way possible. Our bartender was professional, polite and made us feel welcomed. I had 2 Maker's Mark cocktails (early bar menu special) and they were deliciously strong. The crispy shrimp and steak with fries we ordered were perfect and just the right portion size, also from the early bar menu. I was given a special birthday dessert, but after 2 strong cocktails and our small bites I was happily satisfied and could not eat another bite. I look forward to making a reservation for dinner soon. They have a few tables that are semi-private and in close proximity to the kitchen, that's where I want to be during our next visit. Spectacular place, outstanding service, well crafted cocktails and delicious food how can you not love it?!?  I only wish we had captured at least a couple of photos but we were enjoying ourselves to much and our phones never made their way out."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for a friends birthday. Everything was amazing - the cocktails, the food, and the service. Shout out to the woman behind the bar who offered to take our photo (don't remember her name, but she was sweet) and to our server Megan who made the night very enjoyable. Food was on point, even though I ordered way too much and couldn't finish it all. It was my first time here and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner with my familiy. We sat in the back where it was a little more quiet. The back did leave a little to be desired in terms of ambiance but the food definitely made up the difference.  I started with a pork belly appetizer. Scrumptious. Then had a ny strip, my favorite and the best steak I've had in Phoenix, hands down. As a side we shared the bacon. Yes bacon side in a container sticking up like French fries. Who does this? Nobody!! It's like no one else realizes how amazing that idea was. My wife still talks about this restaurant at least once a week and the bacon just as often. I will be back as soon as there is a special occasion justifying my return."}
{"text":"This place is very elegant the lighting is beautiful so your makeup looks on point. But besides the over the top customer service and the best steak I've ever had in my life. It was the experience that captured me, plus with a hot date. It was top notch. Thank you for making our night fabulous ."}
{"text":"The best meal I have had in very long time the ambiance is so beautiful the lighting was perfect this is a great place for a dinner with girlfriends or a date night, I would even feel comfortable going alone and sitting at the bar. My mean was so good I haven't stopped thinking about it I have been suggesting it to everyone and would eat here every night if I could!!!! So in love"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the filet mignon here.  I got mine topped with blue cheese.  It was over priced and lacked flavor. I couldn't even finish my steak because I wasn't enjoying it.  Having had awesome steak at places like Bern's in Tampa I found this place to be a disappointment.  The service was horrible.  The waitress Jesse duo checks and was so inattentive.  I would not return.  I don't mind spending money for quality food.  But spending outrageous prices for Mediocre food is the worst!"}
{"text":"This is most definitely the best and most expensive steakhouse in AZ.... been to this place about 5 times and the food never disappoints, definitely recommend the sea food tower which is so fresh and amazing, I ordered the Chilean sea bass but other people in our crowd got the steak and I couldn't resist from trying it, so tender and perfectly made just be careful don't burn yourself, the plate where the steak is served on is 500degrees, it's true I tested it, still recovering. All the sides are great, I love the asparagus fries in particular. Cocktail Drinks aren't really their specialty but they have an amazing list of different wine. We were a party of 18, I wish they would offer us a private room but I guess that needs to be reserved through an event coordinator, overall great experience, but definitely on the pricier side."}
{"text":"I always find an excuse to dine here, date night, anniversary family get-together, birthday because the service, food and atmosphere is always consistently incredible.  I came here to celebrate my anniversary. We started off with cocktail while looking over the menu. We started off with 3 Colossal Shrimp Cocktail and 1/2 Oysters. Entrees were the  New Bedford Sea Scallop (lemon butter, sea salt, chardonnay) and 16 oz. NY Strip. We ended the evening with an Anniversary Chocolate Dessert.  Evening was perfect! Atmosphere, Food and Service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We celebrated two very special occasions last night with our family. From the moment we walked in we were treated with the utmost courtesy. From the very top on down we continuously asked how the service is to any further requests they could do.  Food as usual is extraordinary in presentation and texture. We look forward to having another wonderful dinner.  I wish I could give more then five stars as they deserve every accolade possible."}
{"text":"This place gets better and better each time I come here. The hospitality is crazy good here. Ashley was an amazing waitress and Dan was an awesome manager. In my life, this has been the number 1 restaurant I have ever been to. I own a restaurant in Chicago and can say that with passion. These guys are doing it right.     Went again last. Isn't with a new group of employees from my company. This place is a 20 out of a 10. There's nothing that they can do to get better. Perfect perfect perfect. Could eat here every day"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary last weekend after it was recommended to him by some coworkers. I ordered the lamb and he got the salmon. We also shared the corn creme brûlée and mac & cheese. I highly recommend both! The corn was sweet and salty and like nothing I've had before and the mac & cheese was perfectly cheesy and traditional (no stinky cheeses or meats in it). I'm so glad we didn't order an appetizer or salad. The portions are very generous and we were both stuffed. The lamb was very well seasoned. One piece of lamb was cooked better than the other in my opinion. Because it was our anniversary, our waitress was kind enough to give us a complimentary dessert. We tried the red velvet bread pudding. I'm usually not a big bread pudding person, but this was delicious. I loved the top where it was slightly burnt and crunchy. The rest was like eating a warm red velvet cake fresh out of the oven. The service was great, definitely a 5-star type of restaurant, which I wasn't really expecting. I will definitely add this place to my list!"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. For this dining experience we went with the Ribeye Steak, Colorado Rack of Lamb, Crispy Hasselback Potatoes, and Roasted Brussel Sprouts. I'd rate the steak as good (flavorful but a little tough) , the rack of lamb as excellent, the Brussel sprouts and potatoes as excellent. For a return trip, I would select a different cut of steak, a filet or strip perhaps. The dinner also came with delicious rolls. The large portions combined with the mouth watering food left little room for dessert, which I am eager to sample on my next visit. The room temperature was a bit warm, but the ambience was nice. My only complaint would be the noise level from the bar."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, but both visits provided outstanding service and the best steak dinner in the history of steak dinners. Fried Deviled eggs, new york strip wagyu, beignets, and bourbon to name a few of the items I indulged."}
{"text":"First time here, had the mac & cheese and Cesar salad and a couple of lemon drop martinis which were awesome. Awesome service by Brian great spot for a date dark and intimate. I went with my girls, will definitely come again when I'm back I town."}
{"text":"Loud with snarky waiters...it was the second time we tried Steak 44 and it will most likely be the last.  I would agree with some other reviews.....there are better places for steaks in Phoenix, sides are small and restaurant loud.  I had a vodka martini made with Titos vodka....$20.  WHAT???? $20. REALLY? Yes...Really.  Now that is stupid.  What is up with that?  The hostess was sweet and the manager seemed interested in knowing how I felt about the $20 martini: steak was good not great. Bread was ok. And the beignets for dessert were hard and dry... But I liked the hostess and manager."}
{"text":"Just amazing! We had 16oz Rybeye Steak and it was delicoius. Totally recommend it! Best steak in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've had dinner here six times. It is our go-to steak place in the valley. GREAT steaks! My boyfriend is a bit critical of steaks and we've had them all over the world - this is one of his favorites. Their service is superb and the sides are also to die for! Recommendations: the chefs cut steak, sweet potato side, caramel cake dessert."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from the oysters and sent them an email about it and they never even responded. For the prices they charge they should treat their patrons better than that."}
{"text":"It's our second visit here and we had a totally opposite experience than the 1 st time and I l gonna write this review here as nobody has contacted me back from the restaurant since past month as I have sent an email them. We knew exactly what to avoid at that place which is a bar area. My bf wanted to come back here as he loves oysters and they really have great and fresh selection of seafood over there. I made reservation online and placed order for the desert in advance as it was my bf bday, I also called the restaurant in advance to request specific seating area as we knew it gets extremely crowded on Saturday nights and if you look in lost of reviews people don't like loud and obnoxious bar area, so I asked to be seated in main dining area, they said no problem. We had reservation for 6:45 getting seated right away with no wait...bar area. I told hostess it's been a misunderstanding bcs I particularly have requested not to be seated in the bar area; she goes no problem so she walks us to PATIO area through another bar; I told her we will not be sitting here as this is another bar area and it's cold here. Hostess leaves and another one comes back to let us know that they only have tables for 4 people and they won't be able one to us. Oh great how kind of you. Having in mind it's 7 pm at that point we didn't leave the place as it's gonna be impossible to find any other dining spot at that time. Server shows up, he is on training. We asked about a wine suggestion for a pinot noir, he tells us he has no good idea about red wines but still never asks his trainer to the table for maybe a little better of suggestion. So we just ordered something of the list. We got oysters for appetizer, they are great of course, steaks prepared to order and no complains here, sides are tasty except I would probably skip on lobster mashed potatoes , those were just little too runny and tasted likes boxed instant potatoes , definitely not worth the price. In a meanwhile the bar area is getting over crowded and all these people just keep pouring into patio area, at this point we have 4 drunk chicks with martini glasses bumping right into my back and apologizing constantly and guys talking about sports and screaming for another beer across the room. Have you ever ate 300 worth of dinner in the crowded room while people constantly are bumping into you? It felt like a night at the nightclub.  The sad part nobody from staff cared and not a once we seen a single manager ! How disappointing is that! We ask for the bill and of course they forget to bring my bf birthday cake, server showed up with 2 cookies and a bill. After I asked them where was his dessert they brought it out. We just paid the bill and left, they took the dessert of our bill \" as they made a mistake \" , oh please do you think anyone cares about $10 pudding after you have ruined whole our night ?"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the area. Steaks are amazing. Can't go wrong with the bone in filet mignon. Vibes are very good. Young, exciting, but not too loud. Couldn't ask for a better atmosphere. Have been back countless times. Staff is also very helpful. 10/10"}
{"text":"What can I say really.    This place exceeded my expectations and I knew they would.  Same owners as Dominic's steak house so I knew already I would be wowed by their service and their delicious dishes.  Greeted and seated within seconds of arriving.  Complimentary valet service for the car and treated like royalty from the start.  I seriously would love to try everything on the menu, but who can eat that much in one sitting.  We will have to go back of course.  The server was very nice and attentive to our needs.  Even the manager came to our table to ask if we wanted to be moved because of a loud group across from us.    The food:  Bread to start and some Miyagi oysters   Main Course:  18oz Bone-In Filet Mignon with Truffle Butter (Yaasss) Double baked Truffle Potatoe (wow) Roasted Brussels sprouts (yum)  Dungeness Crab Cocktail (so fresh)   Dessert: Beignet Tree (drooling)   Let's not forget the amazing Old Fashioned  cocktails too.  This place is a take your partner on a nice dinner date and sit back and relax while you're pampered with service and lathered up with amazing food that's prepared with love!"}
{"text":"Everything was great--Got the table we wanted--The server was fantastic--Constantly rotating customer service--Busboys, Servers, Bartenders--Exquisite Service--Food was shockingly and amazingly rich--Worth every penny--Will visit again"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Our waiter Ryan was amazing and the food was to die for. My favorite was the colossal shrimp! My eyes are still watering from the horseradish! If you are visiting or live in Phoenix you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation on Open Table. I was surprised when I walked up to see it only opened in 2014. Complementary valet parking out front is a good idea as there isn't much in the strip center it is connected to.  Great decor when you walk in. High-end as expected but all the staff was very friendly and not stuffy. Our group of three ordered drinks and wine from their decently large wine selection and then skipped the starters and went right to salads. We agreed the Wedge was the best (as our server mentioned).   Mains of wet-aged steaks (bone-on and filet) were amazing - ask for a little warmer than normal (medium-well came out like Medium for both of us). The fish was good but not great; it is a steakhouse - go with a steak...  We skipped desert, but little cookies came to the table anyway. I will certainly return in"}
{"text":"Went here last night with high expectations for near raw beef. They sat us right on time but the the wait staff took 20 min to find us. For beginners we had oysters which were sweet, fresh and briney. The deviled eggs were a nice new taste. The steaks done perfectly charred on the outside and bloody as I like them inside.   Now my dinner partners soft shell crab was off and not just a little bit. We sent it back. . The Zinfandel we wanted was out without a comparable replacement and the house red was vin less than ordinaire. The milkshake finished the meal and was as good as it could be. The service attention was consistent thought the meal....slow to nonexistent."}
{"text":"Came here once back in the summer and was a fan. Was in the area for work and wanted to have a nice meal. It was a weeknight and pretty empty so grabbed a seat at the bar and got a Filet. Food was excellent and bartender was attentive. I'd come back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Went here for a buddy's birthday. Absolutely great steakhouse if you're like me and love your steak. The place is very classy, very clean, everyone was friendly and the food was absolutely incredible.  Pros: Food = incredible. Steak cooked perfectly, all sides were delicious, drinks were strong. Great location. Friendly and quick service. Very clean restaurant and bathroom.  Cons: Can't think of any. Even the prices were very reasonable for such high quality.  Will definitely go again and I wish they'd open one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant experience. The service was immaculate, on top of every detail, and the food was excellent. I had the Delmonico and it was seasoned & cooked perfectly. My group shared the sauteed mushrooms, which went great with the steak. The Chillean Sea bass & huge crab claws (already split) my guests had were the best they said they've had. Great food & service. They even called the next day to make sure I had a great experience.  If I had to say anything critical, the tables were very close together along the boothed wall tables & took some serious manipulation to squeeze in & out of."}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal at Steak 44.   Began our meal with huge, delicious stone crab with fantastic sauces - mustard is my favorite. Can't beat the creme brûlée corn. Great side dish but could also be dessert. New dessert hot off the press - vanilla caramel cake with ice cream, walnuts and fresh whipped cream. On to the beignets - makes New Orleans look like it's standing still.  Do not miss this!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to S44 now about 5-6 times and dined again about two weeks ago. The thing with S44 is that it seems to get better every time I go, how's is that even possible!  The steaks are always perfection, I had the 18oz bone in filet and it was just a party in my mouth. I was only able to finish half the steak, but it made for great leftovers the following day. The carmel butter cake was a great way to end the night."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, the restaurant is beautiful!  You MUST start with the bread.  Two types of fluffy yeast rolls smothered in butter, served on an iron skillet.  We started with the beet salad, but I saw other yummy options.  Both of our entrees were divine- scallops and sea bass.  Yes this is a steak house but their seafood offerings are amazing.  Buttery Seabass, covered in garlicky breadcrumbs - brown crust outside, moist beautiful fish inside.  6 large scallops sautéed in butter and wine were cooked perfectly.  The only downer was the roasted Brussels sprouts - a tad too salty and over roasted.  Finished with sorbet - bright and flavorful.  I poured Prosecco over it to make frappe.  The service was amazing, you have many servers. Great valet parking too."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite steak spot, the vibe is on point. Its lively and the service is always fabulous. They kick the steak scene up a notch in the valley and make dinner an experience. I this place, its menu, cocktails and wine list."}
{"text":"dine here April 6 for my 30 birthday because of the reviews... For the price was expecting a better steak. the biscuit were delicious though. the corn was too sweet for my liking. the complimentary desert was nice. Wish I could say I would be back but I doubt it. Prices too high for a medium tasting steak and ok side."}
{"text":"Pretty dang impressed (understatement).  Ribeye was one-of-kind.  Fillet, \"muah\"!  Get the scalloped potatoes, carmelized corn, shrimp, MEATBALLS!  Dessert - bread pudding and caramel cake. Yes!  Plus, they make a darn good Old Fashioned (as any self-respecting steakhouse should)!  Looking forward to trying new items on the return trip."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Chuck Berry - Route 66)  Well if you ever plan to eat some steak Just take Bo Bites way that's the smart way that's the best Get your grub on Steak 44  Well they wine from 44th St. to Scottsdale More than 145 degrees all the way Get your grub on Steak 44  One of the better steak places in town in my books.    Formally a Mastros, Steak 44 brings it home with a punch to your palates.  Their operations is quite impressive and the care and craft they have in the back kitchen; as Mr. O gave us a tour, was on spot to explain why this is a hot new dining experience.    Our tabled ordered a bunch of stuff starting with some truffle fries, cream corn, meatballs, and creamed spinach.  We all ordered our own steak, but I went with the bone-in filet.  My steak in general was perfectly cooked, nice charred on the outside and medium cooked in the middle that still steamed with every cut!  The plate is super heated thus keeping the steak warm all through your dinner.  The sides that came along with our meal was phenomenal!  Can't go wrong with truffle fries that came in a glass fries container shaped like a McDonalds case!  The cream corn was how it was supposed to be -- creamy and sweet!  Another highlight of the night was the meatballs - crusty on the outside, while you dip it in marinara and taking a bite release an aromatic burst of the herbs used.    Service was spot on.  I gather coming to a place like this you would expect that and it was met.  The ambiance was classy perfect for date.  Definitely, laid out like a steak house and one visited for at least one experience! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I only eat meat once a year or so, usually to celebrate our anniversary or when my parents visit and this is definitely the place to go!  Everything I have had here is SUPER excellent - steak, sides, dessert, drinks, etc.  The service is professional, pleasant and efficient.  During peak times some rooms in the restaurant can feel a bit \"crowded\" but not uncomfortably so.   Trust me, if you are a carnivore this is the place you want to go!"}
{"text":"The steak is as good as it gets in Phoenix. I've been to just about every well known steakhouse in the valley, along with any butcher shop I can get my hands on that sells prime grade/dry aged meat. Rib eye or rib cap would be my go to but have grilled more tenderloins and strips than I could count. Last night I went for the bone in filet topped with foie gras, she had the  bone in KC Strip. Like I said, best steak in the valley. Period.  We were in a group of six so got to try a lot of the menu. The fried deviled eggs are as good as they sound, The seafood tower and accompanying sauces were as good as any I've had anywhere. If there's a must try side it has to be the corn creme brulee, absolutely amazing. The crab and shrimp mac and cheese was fine, but I prefer the truffle mac and cheese at City Hall. Speaking of truffles we did have the double baked truffle potato...awesome. The only let down on sides were the brussels sprouts, good? Sure...awesome and a must try? Eh....will try something else next time  Service was absolutely top notch from the time we entered the door thru the entire meal. For desert we had a few and the red velvet bread pudding is just ridiculous. Finished the evening with a 20 year Tawny...  Can't wait to go back, would recommend to any steak lover"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! The food was great and the service was even better. They took care of me and my fiancé for our 3year anniversary. Frazier was very helpful and knowledgeable. If you want a good quality steak, steak 44 is the place! #trythebreadpudding"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for my birthday. My son was dying to come here. So what the heck I made the reservations on Open Table. When you walk into the door the hostess stand is right there so they are able to greet you right away. Very friendly. Very accommodating. We had to wait a few minutes so they could get are table ready. As we walked to our table, we went by the kitchen. The kitchen is enclosed in glass so you can see them working. One thing interesting is that their seafood is on display just like a grocery store. Very fresh and they ship it in every day.   Anyways, our table was semi-private booth for six. The booth was enclosed with glass walls. Very interesting and intimate.   The server was really friendly and was quick to bring our drinks. Always filling our water cups without asking. Anyways, we started off with their hot bread. It was so good. So fresh. Really good.   So I ordered the 16oz ribeye and they always tell you don't touch your plate cause it's 500 degrees. We ordered so many side dishes. Let's see we ordered the sugar snap peas, roasted Brussels sprouts, crispy Hasselback potato, and then our server talked us in to the corn creme brûlée. The ribeye was cooked perfectly. Really fresh. Juicy. Loved it and completely destroyed it. All of our sides were so good. We finished them all off. Loved the corn creme brûlée really good and probably one of my favorites. The Brussels sprouts, snap peas, and Hasselback potato were right on. Can't go wrong with any of those sides.   My wife got the prime steakhouse meatloaf and I was able to share some. Thought it was really good. Really moist. Very flavorful with the gravy. One thing my wife did say was that it was a little dry cause they didn't provide enough gravy but she just had to ask for some extra gravy and  was good.   My son had the NY Strip and didn't complain. Destroyed it all. My daughter had the ribeye too (good taste just like her dad), and my mom had the Colorado lamb chops. I think she got like three or four chops. My son tried it and thought was a little dry but I didn't try it (no room otherwise I would have).   For dessert, since it was my birthday I got a free dessert. Not to sure but I'm thinking I ordered the warm butter cake. Had this before at Dominick's and it was really good with a side of fresh whip cream. Always a fan their butter cake. We also ordered their red velvet bread pudding. I thought it was good but their butter cake is the best.   I have to agree with all my Yelp friends that I prefer Steak 44 over Dominick's. Just seems more private and intimate. I loved this steakhouse. Great food. Exceptional service. Great atmosphere and a very very friendly and accommodating staff. I really had a great birthday dinner. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"What can I say about Steak 44, there just isn't enough words to describe how incredible this place is. This is one of the top steak houses in the Phoenix area. Make reservations are you going to be waiting a long time and if you decide to walk in without reservations, it's worth the wait, trust me. It's hip, it's Arcadia and it's GOOD!  When you dine here the staff is tentative to your needs and they take care of you, they go that extra mile.   Some of my favorite starters is the bread (compliments of S44) - yeast rolls with garlic and butter, served hot, melts in your mouth.  Starters:  Super Colossal Shrimp Cocktail, they are $8 per shrimp but the shrimp are the size of baby lobsters. Cooked to perfection. Also, if you're in the seafood mood, get a dozen of the fresh oysters, 6 east coast & 6 west coast. I prefer the east coast oysters but the west is pretty damn good too.  Steaks:  Domestic Wagyu Filet, 8 ounces. I died, it's so good. Also, for that awesome marble steak, try the butchers cut, melts in your mouth. No need for steak sauce or horseradish, the steaks are perfection.  Sides: roasted brussel sprouts, broccoli and hands down, you have to try the Crispy Hasselback Potato, smoked sea salt, truffle butter and chive cream cheese sauce.   The wine selection is awesome. You just can't go wrong here, Steak 44 is the place to go. Perfect for date night, dinner meetings and if your in the bar area, great people watching.  I salute you Steak 44. Keep up the good work. I would give you 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Really good food, prices are high but are expected for a fine dining steakhouse.  Huge wine list but a really spartan and weak beer selection.  It's too bad that this place hasn't caught onto the fact that there are so many good craft beers available that blow stuffy old overpriced wine away in terms of flavor and it is what younger people prefer to drink.  Loved the shishito pepper side dish and would go back just for it.  Certainly attracts the older crowd. Odd strip mall location for a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Best service and meal I've had in a long time. Desserts were to die for. Love love love it! Chef came out and greeted our table. I can't say enough positive things about this restaurant. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. The service alone make its worth coming for. The fried devil eggs were amazing as well. The steak was great however the person who decided to add a pound of salt to the outside for seasoning clearly made a big boo boo. I only could finish half my steak because it was so salty, and it wasn't just mine every persons steak at the table was the same. We also had the oysters. I would recommend a pass on these. We had a few on here that were on the border of turning and I wouldn't call them fresh in any sort. I would recommend they switch their distributor."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in Phoenix and the fact that it is so close by to my house makes it even better! (Camelback/Arcadia)  I've been here three times for various events and the service and food has always been spot on. It's a bit on the pricier end but Steak 44 is worth it.  My most recent trip opened up with the crispy shrimp, superfood salad and fresh burrata appetizers. The crispy shrimp I would have ordered as an entree elsewhere; perfectly fried and tossed with just the right amount of sauce. The superfood salad I thought was ordinary but nevertheless tasty. There's lot of salad and the presentation could have been better. Burrata was a heavenly bite of of crouton, pickled onion and fresh cheese.  Petite filet mignon was simply stunning! Perfectly flavored and melts in your mouth. Sugar snap peas were cooked perfectly. Chef Watson's potatoes were a bit on the heavy side but decadent.  The meal finished off with the ultimate vanilla caramel cake. Easily could have fed two people and the gelato and cake paired nicely.     The bartending staff has been there as a unit since Steak 44 has opened in 2014 and they are easily one of the friendliest and professional staff I've ever met in the industry. They'll take care of you and make great stiff drinks. (Shoutout to Lauren & Connor for becoming my friends that evening!)  If you like Steak, you'll like Steak 44."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse in town. I frequent all the big name steakhouses  but WOW this place was on par with a Michelin star restaurant!  I regret not taking more photos but I was enjoying everything so much!  Great cocktail list and extensive scotch selection that I would consider for the varsity squad. Nothing jr about this scotch selection so bring your discerning taste.  If Oysters are your thing, do order from here. The variety is diverse and overall their seafood selection is super fresh! I can't wait to go back again to see what oysters they have next. Our waiter was fantastic in guiding us in our selection and his service was professional, genuine and attentive.  I had lobster and my husband had some special aged ribeye filet. It was the best steak I have ever had, cooked and seasoned to perfection! We had some nice potato side with the meal that was very flavorful but all my attention was on that steak and lobster. We also had a lobster add on to the steak with this perfect savory sauce that literally gave me a food orgasm! If you are a foodie you get what I'm saying here.  Every bite of everything is perfectly balanced to hit your palette perfectly.  I thought about that dinner for days. It's the type of meal that makes everything in life satisfying!   Then dessert, get their signature dish. Again, all the flavors work perfectly together. It's not too sweet it's perfectly balanced. I forget what it was called but it will catch your eye as you see it being brought out to practically every table.   This is the perfect place for a date, boys or girls night out or business meeting. It's a sophisticated place with modern decor and impeccable service and well trained staff. You absolutely need reservations, the more notice the better for the weekend! I cannot wait to dine here again. On par with a Michelin star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Positive - Simply amazing! Another great Fox concept restaurant. From the Valet- wait staff everyone was friendly and on point. The food was delicious. We ordered the huge Bone in Ribeye and Chesapeake Crab Cakes (loaded with crabmeat, not-breading). The wine list is extensive from $40-$2500 per bottle, entrees $40-$205 Caviar per oz. The Valets were running nonstop to deliver the cars. Negatives - very loud a lot of standing patrons and one intoxicated woman was in front of the place swearing to another person. Suggestions - Make a reservation and the dress code is resort CASUAL, \"reminder\" you are in Scottsdale!  5 Star, again absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Bar is always crowded.  The food is amazing.   Definitely the choice for a great steak in the Phoenix Scottsdale area"}
{"text":"This, my friends, is a high end steakhouse that lives up to all expectations.  My in-laws were in town and treated us for my husband's birthday. We had reservations for 5:15, and when we walked in at 5:10 we were immediately seated and met our server, Scott. He continued to give us extraordinary service all night.  For appetizers, we shared the buttered rolls that were included with the meal, as well as oysters and beet salad. We also shared a bottle of Merlot recommended by Scott, and it was excellent.  My main course was the Shetland Island braised salmon. Wow. Perfection. Along with that, I enjoyed the shared sides of mushrooms and Brussels sprouts. The thick-cut bacon with the Brussels sprouts was the real wow factor there! My 12-year-old son was quite happy with a side of macaroni and cheese (I'd love to know where the noodles come from!) and some fries. My husband rated his steak as among the best he has ever had.  Even though we were all about to explode from good food at that point, we had to share a dessert. My husband was kind enough to go with my preference off the dessert list: brioche and chocolate chip bread pudding.  This is up there with the best bread puddings I have ever had. The brioche had a wonderful texture and stayed in lovely big chunks. The top was kind of caramelized in a glorious way in addition to a drizzle of sea salt caramel, and there was a generous amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips (high quality, by the taste) throughout. A big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream topped it off. Thank goodness we were sharing that among four adults!  Steak 44 was a five-star experience in every way."}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening. This place is beautifully decorated and very inviting. It was Great experience and wonderful food and drinks! Service was superb and I am beyond thrilled to say that I would have changed nothing about my dining experience there. Highly recommended!!!!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my husband's birthday here with 4 friends and we have an absolutely wonderful experience.  I didn't know what to expect but the experience far exceeded my expectations.  The ambience was wonderful.  We were seated in a private room with our table of 6 and 2 other small tables, which was perfect.  The cocktail I had (manhattan) was the best I've ever had!  My friend said the same thing about her cosmopolitan.  The crab cocktail was so fresh and incredibly yummy.  My bone-in fillet was done to absolute perfection.  I had a bite of my friend's veal chop and it melted in my mouth.  Our waiter, Mathieu was an absolutely fabulous server.  We went in the bar for a drink after dinner, which was a super fun people watching experience.  It is a great restaurant, especially for a special occasion, but be prepared to spend!"}
{"text":"Came here with the fiancee great steaks and great people. The service here is impeccable our waiter Darren was on top of everything, he explained the menu very clearly. He just knows his stuff and when you do come to a steakhouse just order the NY STRIP which was really good. The price and the place is worth if you are in the area."}
{"text":"When thinking of a special place to eat for any special occasion, I always book Mastros. Unfortunately, my boyfriend couldn't decide where to eat for his birthday until last minute and Mastros only had a 9pm reservation... so we decided to try steak 44 and thank goodness we did. We ordered the crispy shrimp (I would get he smaller portion next time) and we're extremely impressed and super excited for what was to come. The shrimp tasted so fresh!! We then got lobster and shrimp mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, and steak. Everything was so fantastic and unique... I honestly don't know if I'll ever go back to Mastros after eating at steak 44. The only negative feedback I have is that the service was absolutely terrible. Very very forgetful and confused but the bus boy made up for it and was super quick to refill water, manage plates, etc."}
{"text":"It is a pretty rare thing so far in my life that I am forced to eat my words, but, here I am.   After my last review about a bad experience, management reached out and invited me back in hopes to make things right, so I agreed and went back.   This experience could not have been more different than my first time around. We were sat right away when we walked in. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful. Spending plenty of time explaining the menu, specials and drinks.   Pork Belly and Calamari were the appetizers and they were delicious. Filet Mignon and a Wagyu Rib Eye were the entree's we had and both of our steaks were cooked perfectly. They were delicious, I couldn't have been happier.   They sent out a tree of Beignet's with dipping sauce and a vanilla cake for dessert and again. It was incredible.   Based on the 2nd experience i had here I will obviously be back. Management and the staff obviously care about your experience and genuinely want you to enjoy yourself. Give this place a shot, it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The service is amazing! Great vibe, music, and the food is so tasty. Must get the scallops with corn brûlée and the filet mignon with brussel sprouts. One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Definitely make reservations. No complaints about this place. Great place to come for any occasion."}
{"text":"Best steak ever! Definitely give this place a try. My boyfriend and I were hesitant about coming here because we heard it had the same owners as mastros and we don't care much for mastros, but everything about our meal was perfect. The food was delicious and the servers were extremely nice and attentive. Try the crispy shrimp; it's amazing!!! My boyfriend hates shrimp, but he loved this dish. I'll definitely be coming back; I found my new favorite steakhouse.  PS- Ask to sit in a booth with a view of the kitchen. There's a clear glass wall on one side of the booth allowing you to peer into the kitchen. It's more private and less chaotic than the dining room."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was amazing. The dessert called 'the ultimate warm vanilla caramel cake' is out of this world. knocked off a star only because the parking here is brutal."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Phoenix. If you're looking for ambiance, great service, a great selection of wines, the best steak, and the best fresh seafood in Phoenix Steak 44 is your place. We started off with the fried deviled eggs and the beet salad. The beet salad was very fresh and delicious and the eggs were unlike anything I've ever eaten before. Both of which I will for sure be getting again. The bread they start you off with is also very delicious, most places usually don't have good bread so that's a huge plus. Then we got the Bristol point oysters. Super fresh. Next we got our steaks. My boyfriend got the bone in filet mignon which was 18oz and I got the wagyu. The wagyu is by far the best steak I've ever had. It was very tender and is worth the price tag it comes with. The filet was tender and had a great chat flavor. Our server Charles let us know and it is very true that they Cook their steaks a temperature under since they are served on hot plates. We both ordered medium and they came out a perfect medium rare. For sides we shared the mushrooms were incredible, the mac and cheese was decent, although I wouldn't order it again, and the chef Watson's potatoes were pretty good. For dessert we got the warm vanilla cake which was okay and the beignets which are off menu, but amazing. Our server Charles was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great recommendations. He provided us with a great service experience and was sure to let us know about everything off menu that was offered. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak house restaurant I've ever gone too! It was private seating an excellent service! The steak house closed at 10 And they allowed us to sit there until we were ready to go without rushing us to leave! The complimentary bread that they served in the beginning was melt in ur mouth good me the steak its self was juicy tender good!!! Fantastic is the only word I can use to fully describe this place!! Must go too!!"}
{"text":"I thought that this place was going to be a lot cooler than it was (sorry :/ lol). I thought that the decor was really cute, but I wasn't really vibing with the atmosphere. The tables are very close together & there was a large, loud group of 50-70 year olds getting really drunk near us. I'm all for having fun but they kind of were just gross.   The steak, however, was AMAZING! I ordered the ribeye, medium (10/10) and thought it was great. I thought that the brussels sprouts (7/10), recommended by the waiter, were slightly undercooked. They also recommended the Dominick's potatoes (8/10), which I thought were good but not the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had.  I wouldn't return here, but did appreciate the quality of their ribeye."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour.   Some great food options for a decent price point.  Drinks are a little pricey but too be expected.  Service was very good and had a great time.  The entrees and sides looked pretty good as well.  Will probably swing by around for happy hour and would be a spot to consider for a fancier dinner occasion."}
{"text":"Great Steak and sides.  Very trendy. Nice place to go but not if you want to talk and relax."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here a couple times and I'm not so much conflicted about this rating as I am . . . well, very self-aware of my personal steak predilections.  In short, the steak here is pretty darn good.  That being said, they use so much butter on that bad boy that how much of the flavor is actually the steak itself is really obscured.  There's a no-butter option that I'll have to try next time.  In terms of ambiance, very cool.  This place is chic and bustling.  First visit was way, way too loud.  Could barely hold a conversation.  We were in a little room adjacent to the main bar and it was raucous.  Our second visit, we were in the very back room and the volume was perfect there.  Also noticed some nice semi-private booths walking back.  I ordered a ribeye both times I visited.  First time was a bone-in ordered medium-rare.  Second time was a boneless ribeye ordered medium-rare plus.  (Didn't know that was a thing.)  Our server stated that the chef recommends medium for the ribeyes, which I was hesitant to do, so I went with the medium-rare plus, which was a mistake.  I would stick to mid-rare in the future.  They use prime beef, which is great, but wet-age, which is a less great.  It's priced accordingly (they are, if anything, smart marketers), but given the many options for steak in the Valley, on any given night, I would pick Mastro's or Dominick's for a higher-end steak for a few more bucks.  Am I happy to come back here?  Definitely, it's a solid steak.  Just not a 5-star steak.  As for sides, we have ordered the mushrooms, green beans, french fries, and hasselback potatoes.  All are fine, nothing to write home about.  We did once try a pork belly appetizer which was really quite good, perfect texture.  The sauce was just a tad on the sweet side, but that can be forgiven given the taste of the pork itself.  This place is one of my wife's favorite steak places of all time.  She gives it 5 stars.  I have generally noticed that the women I know like this place more than the guys.  So, if your lady is in the mood for steak, perhaps this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was great and our waitress Megan was awesome. It was our first time there and we were there for our 5th anniversary and she made it special. Great food all around and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"OK, I love a good steak and that did not disappoint.  The steak was amazing.  The appetizers all seemed to be soaked in butter though!  It was a heavy heavy meal.  Way too much butter on the mashed potatoes, way too much butter on the vegetables, I felt a little queasy in the stomach after leaving.  I would give it another chance, but would tell them light on the butter on the toppings, sides, etc."}
{"text":"Kudos to Mastros for finally launching a \"boutique\" style steak house that still serves impeccable tasting meals. This group has always been my favorite steak house group and Steak 44 hasn't disappointed. Typical steak houses are usually white table clothes and boring standard dark wood interior. Steak 44 steps up the game with amazing decor and a cozy intimate space throughout their differently set up rooms in the restaurant. Their sides are quite a bit smaller than the other Mastros locations but still hit the mark on taste. Definitely order the lobster mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"The BEST steak I've ever had in my life. All the service is amazing. Jane is wonderful. Love the wine. Crispy shrimp is fantastic. Corn creme brûlée, the potatoes. Ugh. You just can't go wrong here. This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants and I always talk so highly of it. Recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous space, plenty of the beautiful people crowd, packed on Saturday night.  Wines by the glass were reasonable. The pork belly is the best in the Valley.  Steak is of course wonderful and not as overpriced as some places.  Brussels sprouts with bacon are killer. You can finish with the famous Mastro's butter cake.  Service is flawless. The place to see and be seen for sure."}
{"text":"It's taken a few days to compose this review... there are not enough adjectives to help me. So let's start off with this; it was spectacular!!!   I decided for my 45th birthday to splurge a little on myself, I researched the best restaurant in Phoenix and constantly Steak 44 was the top of the list. I made reservations and impatiently waited. The wait was worth it. As I talked with friends most flat out would say \"I don't go to steak houses, they don't grill as good as I do.\" Well, they are wrong!!! I'm no slouch in the kitchen, but I'll never be as good as what I ate.   I started off with a table in the bar. I was a little annoyed with my placement, I like the pomp of being at a table, but since I was dinning alone I felt I would be a little more inconspicuous sitting at the bar.  I ordered a drink and took in the ambience. I ordered the knife and fork salad. The server wanted to take my full order but I asked to wait and she obliged. The salad came and it was wonderful, the ice berg lettuce was a great conveyance for the blue cheese and bacon. If I had a critique it would be to add some red onion or balsamic vinegar to help cut the fat.   The server started some small talk and I told her it was my birthday (yes I wanted my free dessert). She was very nice, told me she has been there for three months and has enjoyed it. I then ordered my steak, the NY Strip with blue cheese and potatoes au gratin. My mouth salivated with anticipation.   The steak came out and I was not disappointed. I just can't wordsmith enough about how good it was. So I will leave it at that... it was good.   So good.  So very good...   They then brought me out my birthday dessert. It was the most amazing dessert I've had in a while. It sits right below the chocolate birthday cake my mom used to make. It was a chocolate bread pudding with ice cream. Even the cup of coffee was good.   A lot might think it was sad having a solo birthday dinner, but I do me good. I did me great!  It may be a while until I get back... but I shall be back..."}
{"text":"My Wife suggested this venue as a birthday dinner for me while we were in town for the Tillman Run. She made a GREAT choice! We have nothing but GREAT reviews for the food, the waitstaff, esp Nick, the service and the ambiance.  In fact, it was probably the best meal we have had in our 20 some odd years of dining out, worldwide! Since it was a 3 hour drive from home, we wanted to be sure we dressed appropriately and checked the website, which says \"Proper Attire Required.\"  We found we were rather overdressed seeing a plethora of jeans and shorts.  NOT that we would've dressed down to tourist garb or trailer park issued attire for this locale, but a web site suggests business casual for the \"44\" and we complied.  We think others should also, to promote the upscale experience. So be it; we don't have to see it in the semi enclosed dining cubicle, just while waiting in the foyer, waiting to be seated, with other well dressed, mature diners. But how can you ignore a crying, whining baby? Seriously, does a high pitched, fidgeting infant belong in an upscale restaurant?  Isn't there somewhere it can located so as not to disturb other diners peace? I'm sure we will return for another fabulous meal in the future.  I would hope that \"some\" things might change before that time."}
{"text":"From the end to the beginning  Coffee and strawberry gelato were a perfect ending to a great meal.  My \"small\" rib eye was ordered rare +...it was cooked perfectly! I let it sit for couple minutes before cutting into it; it was heavenly. I've been on a quest to try the best steakhouses in the valley and I think this steak is the the finest steak I have had, to date.  The seasoning was subtle  yet so flavorful. The baked creamed spinach had just enough cheese and garlic to keep it interesting.  The Caesar salad was good, if a little dry. The poached egg was an interesting touch.   I started with the shrimp cocktail...at the suggestion of Ryan, I only had one, but it was perfect!  Isn't a dry martini a great way to start dinner?   I've been back twice since this review was initially written. Looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"My husband made a Valentine's reservations for 5pm & booth last week, called just now to confirm that  would be 4 of us and a booth, had to talk to manager, he was just as bad as girl who answered. No booth and 4 can't come. Terrible customer service. So if you think your getting what you think your not! They dont deserve 1 star!!!"}
{"text":"You would expect better service when you are paying about $300 for 4 people to eat there. I decided to go here for my 25th birthday. I ordered the lobster tails and they were very good, but the servers kept getting the plates mixed up when he brought out the salads and the main course. We were switching plates around each time. I also was expecting to get a happy birthday dessert because I noticed a few other people get the same thing, but all I got was a happy birthday. No birthday dessert. It's not a huge thing to get upset about, but when your birthday only comes once a year, you expect to get a nice dessert at a nice restaurant (or even get the dessert taken off the bill). I wanted to then the manager, but couldn't find him as we were leaving. Disappointed.   **Update: the manager got in contact with me and made things right. Thank you for personally going out of your way to do that!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a reservation to celebrate our anniversary.  This was our second visit.  We shared crispy shrimp, heirloom tomato salad,  22oz. ribeye, potatoes and brussel sprouts.  Everything was delicious!  But, the service was phenomenal!! Our server (young Asian? lady - I forgot her name, sorry) was wonderful.  She was genuine, friendly and always available.  The staff there is always outstanding.  Can't wait for our next visit.  (We were there Saturday, March 17, 515pm).  Thanks again for a great experience."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner as part of a group of 7.  We were seated promptly, but in what appeared to be a private dining room where the only other table was a large group (approx 20) that turned out to be a sales manager's team dinner.  Not sure who felt more awkward, them or us (I think they were surprised they didn't have the room to themselves ).    Overall though food and service were great.  Had the bone-in filet.  Nice and tender!  Others in our party had the ribeye, porkchop and meatloaf.  All were good but I think the porkchop was the most flavorful (it was brined).    Didn't knock my socks off but met expectations.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! I have not found a place that can beat this steakhouse in town. Yes it's pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nice atmosphere, fantastic food. The Wagyu steak was delicious, but honestly not worth the price. A regular steak is just as good. The blue cheese as a steak topper is a perfect combination for those blue cheese lovers. Mixing it in with the corn paired well too. The sautéed shrimp were good, but nothing to rave over. The butter sauce they were in is a great dipping my sauce for the bread."}
{"text":"This place would have got a 5 if we didn't have to wait due to the hostess forgetting about us. Amazing food.the steaks were cooked to perfection. The side dishes were amazing. We ordered too many! The waiter was friendly and the management totally made up for the waiting. We were treated to the heavenly dessert of the beignet tree! We will definitely go back. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant and we had an amazing experience! Atmosphere and service is one of the best I've been to. Our server Shawn was very knowledgeable on the food and wine menu, recommending the best. The atmosphere can be either romantic and elegant, or fun and relaxed in different sections. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I may have found my new favorite steakhouse.  One caveat...my meal was paid for by a business associate.  As a result, we sampled a ton of food.  The seafood tower was super and that in itself really was enough for dinner.  The stone crab claws, oysters, king crab, lobster, shrimp were all fantastic.  I love devilled eggs and here they serve them deep fried.  Really cool.  We then ordered the Wagyu Beef.  Like butter it melted in my mouth and was cooked to perfection.  Our sides included spinach, mac n cheese, fried asparagus.  I could have made meal on the sides.  Our waiter was awesome and super attentive.  The GM came to our table a couple of times to check on our experience.  I guess that is what happens when you have a $2000 bill for 5 people.  I have two concerns.  I thought the side dish portions were on the small side and the wine menu which is great does not cater to the average person.  We were drinking $200 - $350 dollar bottles of wine.  I just think there should be more offerings than Meiomi for $45 for the average person.  Based on my experience, I would rate this a little higher than Maestro's City Hall.  What a great night!"}
{"text":"Myself and a small group of friends celebrated my Pre-birthday dinner at Steak 44 this weekend. Without going into a long song and dance about how fabulous this restaurant experience was, I'll  re-cap my experience as the following (OK, it's going to be a long song and dance ..IJS):   1. Food - I had the Braised bone-in Short Ribs, which is one of my favorite dishes, when I can find it on a menu somewhere I normally order it, the meat was fork splitting tender (no knife needed), had just the right amount of sauce and was prepared spot on. Two of my guest had the 8oz Petite Filet Mignon, one had the crispy shrimp and the other had the prime steakhouse meatloaf, all of these dishes were sampled among the group at my table and were hits - the steak was prepared to perfection and the crispy shrimp (though an appetizer that comes in two sizes) had one of the best sweet thai chilies - garlic aioli sauces drizzled on them, that I've yet to taste anywhere else.    2. Side Dishes - My dinner guest all order a single side each so we had about 5 at our table. The sides that I believe were the best that we had were (in this order): Corn créme bruleé - This side reminded me of a combination of  fried corn (my southern folks will know about this) and corn casserole it was baked with a caramelized drizzle of what I think was sugar on top , Dominick's potatoes - I'm normally not a fan of scalloped potatoes, but these potatoes with the combination of Gouda and Mozzarella were just so friggin' delicious, if they added bacon to this dish, I think it would be over the top.  Honorable mentions for side dishes: Baked creamed spinach - it was OK, not one of my favorites, but then again, by the time I got to it the dish was a bit cool, so that may have skewed my likeness of it , the Mac & cheese - was passable, but could have used a little more cheese, next time I think I'll try the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Lastly, Roasted sweet potatoes - were a bit too sweet for my taste, and I love a good sweet potato, but these were not my favorite.  3. Service - The service was excellent, our waitress was very attentive and offered great suggestions regarding the food and wine. Our reservation was made on OpenTable, and I got a call 24 hours prior to confirm my reservation - an actual person left me a voice message! After our dinner the next day an actual person left me another message thanking me for dining at the restaurant. Best service I've gotten in a long time.   I enjoyed my dinner at Steak 44 and would definitely go back again, I mean that Lobster Mac & Cheese is calling my name!   Oh yea, be sure to try the Double Pound Cake for dessert.. Yum to the Tum! I promise."}
{"text":"Magnificent night at Steak 44 for my birthday. Great atmosphere, Sara was amazing-fantastic service. We so appreciated Daniel's expertise and generosity with decadent desserts. Marcus and everyone we encountered demonstrated excellent customer service. Our new go to steak house!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to Steak 44 for a welcome home dinner as she had been away for a week and was really hoping that the restaurant would live up to the reviews I had seen but unfortunately I had a not so great experience.   First the atmosphere was off. They stuck us at a table that had a speaker directly over it blasting all sorts of different music which made it almost impossible to talk without yelling. The restaurant was so dark that multiple people had to use their iphone flash lights to read the menu which is not only annoying, but also distracting when you are getting blinded by another persons flashlight.   The service was a mixture of both good and bad. Our waiter was down right terrible. MY girlfriend and I rarely drink and when we said we wanted just water and a ginger ale his eyes glazed over and he was done with us, you could tell right away. I asked him if there was any specials and he said \"nope, we have our menu.\" Never explained the menu and only stopped by once during our meal to ask us how our food was before we even took a bite. There was a table of 6 next to us who ordered wine and he was more then happy to go over the menu and be polite and attentive. The only thing that helped save the service were the 2 bus boys who kept on top of everything all night and were extremely polite and kind.   Now to the food. I will say this, Steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly, obviously at a steak house that is important. We ordered two apps the pork belly and the meatballs. Meatballs were delicious and a big serving, they were juicy and fried on the outside and the marinara had a good tangy flavor. The pork belly was way over cooked which gave it a hard chewy texture. It was also very lean for pork belly. For sides we got the spinach and brussel sprouts. Spinach was just steamed and unseasoned which is something that could of been done easily at home. The brussel sprouts were okay. They had bits of bacon, drizzled in olive oil, and I believe a little horse radish for a bit of a kick.   Long story short, over priced, food was a mixed bad, terrible service and ambiance. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Hector was an amazing server! He made the whole experience amazing with recommendations. I had the 18oz bone in fillet and my date had the 12 oz fillet. We had the lobster Mac and cheese and the sautéed wild mushrooms. This is not a place you go to not hungry. The portions were great the appetizers and deserts were phenomenal! Go here and have a wonderful dining experience"}
{"text":"We came here for a nice night out while on vacation for the Adele concert (unfortunately we had tickets to the show that was cancelled). Our outing here definitely helped smooth the the concert cancellation. The decor and the ambiance are incredible sophisticated and luxurious. We were greeted by a friendly staff, and with delicious garlic skillet bread that was amazing. I had a glass of Malbec and my husband a cocktail and both were delicious. My husband and I pride ourselves in somewhat being steak connoisseurs, and Steak 44 served some of the best steaks we've ever had. I had the 12 oz NY strip, my husband had the 8 oz filet mignon (made medium and medium rare, whoever orders their steak well done is no friend of ours). The sides were amazing as well, the seafood Mac and cheese and the creamed spinach went along perfectly with our steaks. I'm so happy we decided to go here for our fancy night out, cannot give enough positive feedback!"}
{"text":"First of all let me just say the list of specialty cocktails was amazing. I would recommend the Strawberry Rhubarb, delicious and refreshing. We arrived early to enjoy bar area drinks and it was a packed house but still enjoyable with attentive bartenders. When our table was ready they text us and we were seated immediately to a nice intimate table in the front of the bar area. Our waitress was phenomenal and her recommendations were superb, hassleback potatoes were spectacular. I will absolutely be coming back for delicious food, friendly service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food, steak was perfect, tasty sides, and our salads both had some kind of wonderful crumbly cheese on them.  A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Delafino (I ordered medium rare) came out almost blue rare, but was still very good, despite the top 1/3 having much gristle--not fat, chevy, sinew-y gristle. The rub was VERY salt-heavy. It was a good steak, but not a fifty-dollar one. Maybe I just got a bad one. Others at the table felt theirs were worth the money. Service was some of the slowest I've seen. Just negligent. Server would come back with one beer. Then leave. Then come back and say, \"I'll give you some more time to look over the menu--all this after we'd been at the table for an hour, and that after having been seated 25 minutes after our reservation time. Water and fresh rolls were checked and filled by someone else--he was excellent. Overall we were there three hours. No wonder it's hard to get a table here sometimes. Sides were good. Broccoli was just broccoli, but good. Mac and cheese was fantastic. Veal meatballs appetizer was very good, too...and actually pretty filling. Order it to share! Anyway. Pretty good food, but absolutely not worth the high-ish prices, based of off what I experienced. Overall okay experience, but probably won't return."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! I can't speak to the steaks but all the seafood I've had is off the charts delicious. Crab and shrimp Mac and cheese doesn't disappoint either!"}
{"text":"Came here for a small business dinner on a Sunday night.  Sat at the bar.  Service and food were awesome.  I had the shrimp cocktail, a small bone-in fillet, mashed potatoes, and the sweet corn brulee.  The shrimp are giant and the sweet corn brulee is one of the best sides I have ever had.  All the food was absolutely delicious.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Bar scene was vibrant."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here, the day after eating at Steak 44, still thinking about it.   I had the Ribeye Filet. I've had many, many steaks in my life and this was definitely top 5.   I've already decided to make reservations for next weekend!"}
{"text":"A perfect meal from the menu to mood and the  music.  Our server Shawn Robertson was amazing as was the entire team.  We also enjoyed visits from Daniel, the general manager, he was so friendly and wanted to make sure everything was as we wanted and that we were having a good time.  It was quite simply the best meal we've ever had! We started off with the fried deviled eggs- amazing- then we had the calamari & shrimp- delicately battered , fried and delicious. We both had the Delmonico ribeyes. Mine was with the Oscar style- my husband had his prepared in the classic way.  They arrived sizzling and juicy- perfect! We also enjoyed the Vidalia onion rings and the cream corn brûlée- yummy!!Then we also got spoiled with the treat of the strawberry shortcake- which was simply sublime!  We can't wait to go back; the service, atmosphere, fabulous food and value make Steak 44 a keeper and a classic in the world of Five Star fine dining restaurants."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our one-year anniversary October 3rd 2016. From the personalized reservation to the reserved table this place really knows how to wine and dine their guests especially if it's a celebration. The staff went above and beyond to make sure me and the wifey where 150% satisfied. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  I took my honey out for a steak dinner and WOW do I have good taste in restaurants.  We were treated very well by the staff.  Completely impressed.  I dont think I have ever been treated as well as I was at Steak 44.  We felt very important and the service was spot on.  We both had the filet and it was delicious!  Filets were served on a sizzling plate and were very tasty and did not need any sauce.  So tender and juicy.  I love the booths that were back by the kitchen where you could watch the chefs cook.  It was very cozy and sort of secluded but you could still see the kitchen.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return.  Great job Steak 44!"}
{"text":"This was the best dinner I've ever had. Incredible wine selection and the most amazing service I've ever experienced. Went there for our first anniversary and they even let us pick out dessert on them. (Get the beignets, they were delicious). The filet was flavorful, and the mushrooms were outstanding. Whipped potatoes were amazing as well. I would give this place 1000 stars if I could. I will be back again as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Top notch service, upscale environment and incredible food. Our server was very attentive and gave great recommendations. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere, but my food wasn't top quality. I had the fillet mignon and I was disappointed. Overpriced in my opinion. I got to expense it for work, but I still feel the food wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Everything about this place says \"you're spending way to much money to be in a place where cows died for your pleasure, so stop thinking about your health, the environment, morality, or your future and just embrace hedonism.\"  I ate the steak nearly raw. I could nearly hear the cow mooing \"eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you die\" as I chewed its tender flesh and washed him down with a glass of wine the color of the blood that gushed from his arteries no more than a few days before. The meat here is very fresh.  The creamy spinach has an average median salary of over $100k, and drives the Ferrari out front. Rich and ostentatious, it doesn't bother squirreling away its money in trust funds for the kids - it's all up in your face about it.  The potatoes are there because white people from Paradise Valley get uncomfortable with too much color on their plates. They're there to remind them that Manifest Destiny is still alive and well.  The Caramel Cake dessert wrote a poem once:  Let not thy heart flag. Follow thy desire and thy good. Fulfill thy needs upon earth, after the command of thy heart, Until there come for thee that day of mourning.  You'll pass a wall of cleavers on the way out, a reminder that your pleasure mandates death. And as you burn the dinosaurs on the pavement of dead mountains in a car that in a little time is to be a stripped metal carcass in desert junkyard, think \"from ashes to ashes and dust to dust\" and take joy from the inevitability of death."}
{"text":"Had to send a steak back too rare in the middle but they handled it well and were great.  This restaurant has a killer vibe. It's like a not quite as busy and cool to be seen Version of City Hall. Except not as good of food either."}
{"text":"We've known about Steak 44 since they opened in April, however, had never been there.  We've sort of written off expensive steak houses in the Valley because we make better meats and fish on our infra-red grill at home than can be found at most steak houses.  The last time we ate at one of such referenced places (I will keep the name nameless) I sent my $50 salmon back two or three times (I RARELY send food back to the kitchen, but at $50 it was going to be edible) and ended up not eating that night, as by the time all was said and done our entire group had already finished their meals.  Because it was my husband's birthday, and the menu looked good and reasonably priced, we decided to break our grudge towards over-priced steak houses and give Steak 44 a try.  Wow!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  The menu had so much to pick from, it was hard to decide what to order.  The food was outstanding (wait till you try their bread!), as was the ambiance and the entire staff.  Our server was a lovely young woman named Ibki (I apologize if I have the name misspelled) who was not only professional, attentive, genuinely friendly, but was also extremely knowledgable about the entire menu and wine list-- she hit it out of the ballpark with her red wine suggestion!  We will definitely return to Steak 44, though our lack of desire to go back to other upscale steak houses remains.  Treat yourself and give Steak 44 a try, you'll be hooked.  BTW... they also offer a tremendous Happy Hour in a beautiful surrounding."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great steak, you must try the corn creme brûlée! Perfect location. it is a bit loud but if you sit away from the bar you will be good. The service wasn't really anything to remember. But i will be back. Steak 44 is like the younger, cooler version of dominicks."}
{"text":"Went there twice so far. Amazing presentation and such a wonderful place. Our friend got a bit tipsy since it was her bday and was getting a bit \"fresh\" towards  the waitress but the server took it like a pro and was really kind and attentive regardless. Excellent food and a great staff. The manager brought us a gorgeous dessert and we had a blast:))"}
{"text":"Love this new place. Great lively atmosphere! We started off with the amazing fresh baked bread they bring out, and then had a crab & avocado stack which was really fresh and delicious. Shared the NY strip which was good.. Just not my favorite cut of meat. We had the baked potato side which was amazing!!! Overall great experience, will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best steak I have ever had. Simply perfection. The food and service is totally worth the cost. My reservation was last night and I received a call the day after thanking me for my patronage and checking to see if I enjoyed my meal. That's impressive."}
{"text":"While, I think the prices here are just as comparable as other high end steakhouses, I think the attitude is a little more turned down.  For example, the prices are comparable to Mastro's.  But servers appear more personable and patient.  Not as snooty as Mastro's.  I mean, when they lead you thru the kitchen, that is hardly fancy.  It is more down to earth....with really expensive food.  I would rather avoid the chaos of the kitchen.  No valet parking as far as I could see.  Park yourself and walk in.  No need talking about the food.  If you're paying $50+ for a steak, it better be amazing.  If it's bad, you'll  hear/read about it.  Of note, order anything on the bone.  I truly think the bone gives more flavor to the meat."}
{"text":"I came here for NYE. Steak44 is located by AJs off of camelback and 44th.   The atmosphere... They have valet available though we did not opt for this. Inside you'll see has low lighting and thoughtful decor. Everything from the light fixtures to the wall paper seemed well designed and put together. We sat in a booth which had a kind of frosted glass on the walls dividing us from the other tables to feel more private. There was fabric on one of the walls, and beautiful wall paper on another.   The service is similar to Mastro's. You have multiple waitstaff assisting and sides are served in a cast iron pan to share family style. Your entrees are sizzling hot when they arrive.   Ordered.....   Appetizers: shrimp (HUGE), oysters (YUM)  Sides: Mushrooms, creamed spinach, lobster mash potatoes. (All fantastic choices)  Main dishes: filet mignon and NY steak.   All of the food and drinks (Pellegrino, Prosecco, Chardonnay) were excellent.  Service....  Everything arrived quickly and as requested. Though the server wasn't sure if he could accommodate our steak request (but he did!). When I asked for more information about the types of oysters he seemed knowledgable.   All in all, the experience was fantastic. The food and atmosphere were amazing."}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for a date night.  It was a Friday night at about 8:30 and there was still a 45 min wait for a table. We ended up being sat right away in the bar area which was fine with us.  The service was great.  Our server was polite and attentive.  Drinks and food came out as expected.  The food was excellent!  Hubby had a steak and potatoes, I ordered a salad and a side.  Everything was very well prepared.   The crowd on the other hand was... interesting... a lot of older men wearing bedazzled jeans and button downs and a ton of cougars.  I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, or just happened to be this night.  But the people watching was on point.  Seems like a lot of the Scottsdale Quarter/Kierland regulars decided to take a trek down south to Arcadia to have a night out.   Nothing wrong with that- just something we noticed straight away.  Even had a group of men with what appeared to be their \"hired dates\" for the night.    Luckily the food at this place is enough to keep me coming back, but the whole thing was rather comical."}
{"text":"Just had Valentines dinner there. We won't be returning. We tried it because it is a Dominicks resturuant,  but this place is so far below Dominic's,  I can see why they have used an alias - Steak 44  From the get go I was displeased. Since I use handicap parking, I was more than upset to see Paid Valet parking was using handicap slots to swap out cars. I bad to drive to the back lot & hobble in from there.  Then they tried to seat us at a table that was like being seated on the 101. Traffic congests there & no privacy. We demanded to be moved.  After us they tried to dump this table on 5 other couples within a hour. Finally a young couple who doesn't know better stayed.   The food was good,  but no where like Dominic's.   What you have here is a HIGH priced pick up bar, where if you're hungry, they'll feed you.  I don't know who the designer was, but whomever it us should be FIRED!!"}
{"text":"Comparisons of Steak 44 to Mastro's aren't outlandish because Steak 44 is owned by the Mastro family. If you know where the bar is set by Mastro's, you can expect the same level or better at Steak 44. You'll get your classic chops with fresh seafood accompanied by top notch service.  After we used the free valet to park, we were seated immediately in the dining area across from the bar. There are multiple dining areas in the restaurant and the area we were in was probably the loudest. The combination of the music and noise from the bar made it hard to focus. I almost had to turn on the sonar to ping my wife across the table because it was also way too dark for my liking.  We spent a pretty penny, but the food was great. Nicole was our server and assisted with everything we needed, including helping us put together our seafood tower of king crab legs and oysters. The 22 oz bone-in ribeye served on a sizzling hot plate was marbled nicely, cooked evenly at the right temperature, and didn't stand a chance with me. My wife also enjoyed her pan seared chicken. The vanilla caramel cake was just what we needed to finish.  The damage came out to a pricey $230 pre tip for my wife and I. I would recommend asking to be sat at one of the remote sections to avoid the noise, but overall a quality steakhouse with fresh seafood in a lively environment."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic meal, Frazier made sure we had an excellent time and that our wine and water glasses were full. Steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides were amazing. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"The steak was absolutely amazing, as were the sides. The service was also impeccable. Definitely a pricey place, but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I made my reservations here on yelp and it was so easy!! My fiancé was so surprised for his birthday since he never heard me making his birthday plans!!  We were walked to a special area and had the most incredible meal!! We are still talking about it days later...   We were taken care of at every turn and given incredible suggestions that made our night complete! Everyone from our waiter to the hostess were awesome! (Our waiter was even wearing a breast cancer awareness ribbon tie, I thought that was a great touch on his part)   We had a wonderful time and ate incredible food... If your looking for a place for a nice evening or to celebrate anything, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Came here for our 50th Anniversary. We sat in booth 502. It overlooked the kitchen.Friends took care of the evening and they along with the restaurant made it a very special night . The food was fantastic and the company was even better"}
{"text":"The food is incredible and service impeccable. The small touches made the night. The Wagyu filet melts in your mouth. Would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Great service and generous staff. Celebrated our anniversary here and everything was perfect! Food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my moms 71st birthday. We use to love this place and would take friends and family there for birthdays and celebrations. This was by far the most disappointing experience. Our waitress was named Nicole and seemed too good to serve us. In several occasions through dinner we had to flag her down to ask for things. She never once had a smile on her face and acted like we were burdening her. For a party of 5 to pay almost $500, I would think she'd have provided much better service. We received much better service from the 2 waitress assistants whom were more polite and attentive.  As far as the food goes, it was good. We ordered filets that were really tasty. The sides and bread were good as well.   The overall experience was clouded by the poor service we received from Nicole who seemed like she hated her job. We won't be coming back. Nor will we be recommending to others. There's plenty of other high end restaurants who we can give our business to."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so maybe I set my expectations too high.  They have an expansive wine list which was nice, I had the 22oz bone in Ribeye....it came out sizzling on the plate but was overcooked, I expected the steak to melt in my mouth needless to say I was disappointed.  When I pay fifty dollars for a steak I expect it too be excellent.....just sayn."}
{"text":"I had won a $100 gift card in a holiday raffle and went with two family members.  We had a wonderful meal and service was outstanding.  We had a semi-private booth which was wonderful.  We all had a different beef entree, I had the braised short rib.  Everyone's meat was cooked to perfection as ordered.  The sides were delicious, we each had a favorite, mine was the corn brule.  What we had: Apps: Meatballs and Fried Deviled Eggs.  Both were unique and delicious.  Entrees: Braised short rib, NY Strip (bone in) and Filet (Bone in).  All were excellent and cooked perfectly to preferred temperature.  Side: Corn Brule, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, Dominicks Potatoes.  Delightful.  Server: Sara, she was helpful, attentive and personable!  The restaurant is upscale but not snobby.  If I weren't allergic to shellfish, I would love to give some advice on this but the selections looked fresh and enticing.  I want to go back and sit in the bar area which looked fun/inviting."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for a steak place. Everything was great about this place including our server. I always thought the best steak places were in NYC or Vegas & Chicago..... NOT until you experience this place. Congratulations on a 5 starr from me!"}
{"text":"To start, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into when I took my wife to Steak 44 for our anniversary last night. I knew the meal would be delicious (enough people rave about it). I also knew it'd be expensive, but we decided that this special occasion was worth the splurge.  To be quite honest, everything went great. The waiters/waitresses were kind and welcoming. The complimentary garlic bread was awesome. The guys serving water were on the ball the entire night - literally we'd take a sip and 2 seconds later someone was filling it back up. Our waitress explained the menu for our first time and gave great recommendations. She was patient with us. The ambiance was dim and romantic. A little loud, but no louder than any other restaurant.  My wife got the filet mignon Oscar Style and I got the bone-in ribeye. We also ordered Cesar salad, lobster Mac and Cheese and corn brûlée to share. They brought out lobster mashed potatoes instead of Mac and cheese. I normally wouldn't have said anything, but I reluctantly told the waitress because the mac and cheese was literally the only thing on the menu she knew she wanted. The waitress apologized. Surprisingly, she told us to enjoy the mashed potatoes and that the mac and cheese would be right out. Whoa... awesome! No biggie right??  After dinner, the waitress brought out a dessert. The plate said \"Happy Anniversary\" on it. She said, \"We wanted to surprise you with this. I hope you enjoy it.\" Very cool of them! We did enjoy it.  The waitress gave us the bill and, turns out, she CHARGED US for the dessert ($8) and lobster mashed potatoes ($27). I figured it was a mistake, but I was too embarrassed to critique the waitress again, so we just paid for it. Today I received a call from Steak 44. They said they saw that they accidentally charged me for those items and that I'd see them refunded on my card soon. Very cool!!   I highly recommend Steak 44."}
{"text":"We had a special birthday dinner here on 9/22.  The entire experience could not have been better.  We were promptly seated as we arrived and taken to the perfect intimate table for dinner.  The entire wait staff was terrific and our waitress was truly amazing. Our meal selections were perfectly prepared.   As an interesting aside, the restaurant called the following day to see how our dinner had been the evening before - don't recall any other restaurant (irrespective of price) ever doing this, it was a nice touch.  We will definitely be back.    Note - The place is very popular, so reservations for dinner are a must."}
{"text":"I just went for a drink. Ended up with drinks , appetizer and the ever so delicious dessert with Smores like taste. The marshmallow top was lit in front of me. Can't say enough about this dessert. Bartender female is very good."}
{"text":"Can I give this place a zero? Absolute worst service. Don't dare order a beer you will be pegged as a pauper - food was fine - I received a phone call after our \"experience\" the \"girl\" that called to inquire about our evening literally took our feedback and did NOTHING wtf is the point of asking about my experience and doing nothing, steak 44 my advice -- treat your customers with respect - your $200 steak is not that great and if you continue to employ assholes as servers you will get assholes as customers."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations here for my birthday. It was our first time here. Place is elegant with dim lighting - it was nice. We seriously felt out if place upon entering, but we were greeted by everyone at the front so we tried to not feel out of place.   Started off with the avocado and crab stack as an appetizer. My husband liked it, but it wasn't for me. I ordered the lamb (I've been ordering this every where I go - trying to find the best one), but unfortunately, it was just okay. Sadly to say that I've had better. My husband got the ribeye with the bone in and that was fantastic! For the sides we got the corn creme brûlée and I loved it, fries - were tasty, and mac n cheese (this was okay. At the end we also ordered their strawberry butter cake and it was good. Since my husband made reservations and noted that we were celebrating my birthday, they comp my dessert - sweet deal!   We were surprised to have missed a call from them the following day. They wanted to know how our experience was. I actually came to this restaurant because a co-worker of mine works here and recommended I come. I thought what better day to try than my birthday. How lucky am I that my meal wasn't as great as my husband's? I knew I should have ordered the tomahawk steak!   The only other bummer thing was that we didn't get served bread. Yeah, I know I could have asked for it, but this was a fine dinning restaurant and it was my first time - I was observing and taking notes on how we were being treated. I didn't know how we got missed on our bread, the people to our right, the group in front to the left, group in front to the right, and people seating to our right side - all got bread. Did it bother me -  totally! Why? Made me feel a bit out of place.   I did like the bus boys - they were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is outstanding!! Literally everything was amazing. Had the filet. Amazing. The cream corn. Amazing. Asparagus. Amazing. We are frequent diners at Mastros. Steak 44 is a cut above. We will be back. Thanks."}
{"text":"High quality here.  My filet was very good:  great flavor, appropriately trimmed... they know how to cook a steak \"black and blue\" and get it right (a lot of places don't).  My side of Brussels sprouts was very good. The bread they serve, very well known locally, was a tad too salty for me but still good. Very good wine selection by the glass.   Service was attentive without pestering.   The only downside was it was REALLY noisy, but, it was Friday night and the place was packed, so that's understandable."}
{"text":"Yes please! Enough said. It was a sweet surprise to come here on a busy Friday night. My friend and I sat at the high top table right inside the lounge and let the high class customer service begin. I wanted to try something different than what my usual order is at Mastros City Hall. We started with the meat and cheese plate. Every cheese and meat was of high quality and flavorful. I ordered the Chilean sea bass with the creme brûlée corn Asa a side. Every bite was AHHMazing. This place is on my list to come back..sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"We came to Steak 44 for a friend's birthday and experienced some \"hits\" but also many misses.  I have eaten at their sister (ok Mother ship) Dominick's in the Scottsdale Quarter and am familiar with the brand.  We had a large party of 22 to celebrate a birthday and it was nice that the restaurant was able to accommodate us.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very intimate and a nice place to bring a date.  We were whisked through the kitchen back to a private(ish) room. I say ish because it was our party of 22 and another party of 10 who were also celebrating a birthday.  While sitting down, the birthday boy clarified with the hostess that we were indeed set up for 22 people and she confirmed yes.  Upon seating, we realized we were only set for 17 and needed to squish together to fit 5 more people.  I at first was a little miffed by my $19 Kettle One on the rocks, but was delivered a shaker that contained more booze so really I got closer to 2 drinks.  The blue cheese stuffed olives were also a nice touch.  My dining companion and I decided to order an appetizer and were not disappointed with the fried deviled eggs.  We ordered the 4, which we perfect to share, but wished we had ordered the 6 instead they were that good.  We also decided to split their special that night, a 22 oz Bone-In Ribeye accompanied with 3 diver scallops in a brown butter and ordered the Dominick's Potatoes and the Brussel Sprout sides.  Here is the problem I have with Dominick's and now Steak 44, I get steak envy.  Other guests who ordered the same exact cut, the same exact temp, often have larger cuts of meat and I end up with the piece the looks like it was the end cap of the cut.  I know steaks can vary due to temp and hand cut steaks at that, but it always seems like I get the hacked piece while my friend's get works of art.  We both enjoyed the cheesy potatoes but the Brussels came up lacking, they should definitely remove the \"get these\" from the dish description.  Here comes more of the \"misses\".  We had two servers for our table, one gave a completely different explanation of the specials than the other (our server said the scallops were cooked with olive oil and S&P while the other mentioned brown butter, two totally different things).  Orders were taken in waves and menus were removed once an order was taken but they still managed to miss 2 of our party who had to flag them down to place their order.  We also had to request bread which is normally brought out before the meal.  Our server was polite enough to let us know he did not charge us gratuity, but pointed out we were charged a 4% administrative fee for the hostesses setting up our table.  Between everyone at the table we paid $80-100 to the hostess for our table to be set up, the table that was set up incorrectly.  Finally, even though we had 2 servers, checks took forever to come out and to be run.  The ambiance was nice but I prefer Dominick's to Steak 44.  The live music at Dominick's is way more appealing than the hits of the 80's, 90's, and Today that was played at Steak 44.  Nothing beats listening to the Boss sing \"Born in the USA\" while you eat a $60 steak.  This review is closer to a 3 star but because I'd rather eat at other locally owned steaks houses instead of Steak 44 it's getting a down grade.  The 2 star review is because of the many misses of the evening, if you want to be 5 stars then experience should seamless."}
{"text":"Amazing Experience!! Everything about this place is 1ST CLASS.  I don't write a lot of reviews but this experience was review worthy. My husband and I moved to Phoenix last year from Dallas TX. Being from Dallas there is not a shortage of great fine dining steakhouses and I would guess that we've eaten at 90% of them.  We had heard that Steak 44 was started by the original owners of Maestros (now owned by Laundrys) and current owners of Dominick's so based on experience we felt confident we were in good hands for a fabulous meal.  Even with that little nugget of information and confidence we still were pleasantly surprised by how wonderful everything was.  Hands down the food was some of the best quality I have ever eaten. The freshness, flavor, and presentation was an A+  On top of that the quality of service we received was some of the best I can remember. From the valet, hostess, waiter, management, and everyone in between we were highly impressed.  Our waiters name was Taylor Castleberry and he was fantastic. He was friendly, knowledgable, and provided some of the best service we've ever received.  The assistant Matthew Collins was also very impressive. He too was friendly and knowledgable. He went out of his way to help us with a to go order to be able to take more stuff home even though he was visibly busy. He has a great attitude and the two of them seem to work great together and have a positive energy which provides your guest with an instant level of comfort.  This was Saturday April 29th and I believe the manager on duty was named Seth. He too came by our table twice to make sure we were satisfied. He was polite and professional.  We will continue to dine at Steak 44 and I would encourage anyone I know to check it out.  We LOVED it!  Thank you Steak 44 for making our anniversary dinner special. Oh and for the complimentary dessert :)   The Johnsons"}
{"text":"My family brought me here for my birthday,  and what a pleasant experience.  The food was excellent,  the service was superb, and our overall experience was top notch.  Thank you Steak 44 for a perfect birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Our anniversary experience was far from what words can describe! The staff was so accommodating and truly went above and beyond with their service. The food is totally top notch and was by far the best steak and crab I have ever consumed! The only down fall was the table that was next to us were smoking e cigarettes and made a scene the entire time during dinner. Since on the reservation they asked the occasion I would assume they would place us somewhere more private to enjoy the experience. Having an expensive meal tampered by cotton candy smoke and a loud crowd was disappointing. Hopefully in the future Steak44 can band or ask their diners to refrain from smoking inside the dining room! Would highly recommend but be aware of the crowd they let in there!"}
{"text":"This the kinda of food I appreciate, even though its a bit pricey, I enjoyed it and will definitely be back again. The staff are super friendly and professional. Highly recommended! Cheers."}
{"text":"To start with, the positives.   GREAT steak.   Have no complaints, and done just as I asked for.    Side dishes were excellent.   A nice pour of whiskey for my drink.    My companion was quite pleased as well as it pertains to the food quality.     Negatives - I think the seating is a bit close for \"fine dining,\" and the wait staff isn't too interested in you unless you're ordering the most expensive stuff on the menu.     My dinner companion and I were not all THAT hungry, and so we only spent $200.   Apparently that wasn't impressive enough for our waiter, who didn't even thank us when he picked up the signed slip and generous cash tip.    For as good as the food is, I do think it's a bit pricey there, and I'd rather spend $200 at Durant's for a little quieter atmosphere, more polite/less stuck-up service, and an all around better experience.    Which is what I'll do; despite the quality of the food, it's not better than Durant's, the service is snobbish, and the atmosphere is far too noisy.   I guess if we'd spent $500 by ordering the obscenely priced $195 entree we would have had more polite service."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, and being that we are big fan's of Mastro's City Hall, steak joints have pretty big shoes to fill.  Overall I was happy with pretty much everything here.  My boyfriend and I both love a good filet, and it was goooood.  However, on both visits the kitchen had a little trouble getting the temperature right, but on a big cut of meat that happens sometimes.  They did handle it promptly and got it right.    If you order the shrimp cocktail... beware...the shrimp are gigantic.  Two is probably too many for one person unless that is all you are eating.  The asparagus side was good, but the hash browns were a bit of disappointment, a little to heavy and greasy for my taste, based off the menu description I was expecting more of \"funeral potato\" type dish, but they are deep fried square logs with a chive dip on the side.  They tasted good but are are heavy and greasy. I wouldn't get them again     Service is very good.  We will go back. OHHH the rolls are to die for and the fried dough is amazing, don't pass on dessert here!"}
{"text":"Steak 44? More like \"King Crab Legs (KCL) 44\"  * most delicious KCLs I've had in Arizona * but, ok...steak too! one of the best filet mignons * best martini \"heavy pour\" is how they do it   Add to those superlatives...the chill early evening ambiance of   the largely-windowed dining area with the fireplace - I'm dubbing that spot - \"Steak Solarium\" - and you have an exquisite sensory experience. Bring on the attentive service and you have an exceptionally wonderful evening.   \"22 oz Bone-In-Ribeye 44\" is what my husband would rename \"Steak 44.\" He was also starchly-satisfied with the mac-n-cheese and mashed potatoes. I didn't think much of the mashed but those aren't what I'm all about. I enjoyed the complimentary bread skillet.   I order my steak \"medium rare\".  I seldom order a side of KCLs - I'll only go as far as \"Oscar\" because I'm generally disappointed by seafood at steakhouses. Not only did I like these KCLs, I was captivated by them for a good ten minutes. Finally slicing into my steak, I had a fleeting concern that it was overdone. No, it was not as pink as I've come to expect for \"MR\" but it tasted far better than any steak I've had in recent memory in the Valley. Both the server and manager made it clear that if it was not satisfactory...to say the word. I was satisfied. They also gave me a tip I've never before needed in the past - \"order it 'rare plus'\" if I expect not to slice into it promptly.   \"Excellent,\" anytime, any way you slice it. I look forward to future visits to my \"Steak Solarium\" and to finally checking out HH in their equally stunning bar area, which is interesting because on a new restaurant, we like to do the happy hour first. The crowd is a pleasant mix: locals, visitors, businesspeople, couples, singles and it does not have that \"affected\" vibe that sometimes one can feel in a popular spot. It is, of course, your higher end price point, but quality, service and ambiance warrant it."}
{"text":"Wife and I spent our 17th anniversary here.  The service was great and so was the food.  Bone in rib eye is the only way to fly as far as I'm concerned.  Very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  I judge all steakhouse experiences by their wedge and their wedge was on point.  So many great things on the menu its hard not to over order so be careful. They have some sides you don't see other places.  The corn creme brulee was great as well as the sweet potatoes. The bread pudding desert was tasty and the wine was delicious.  Only negative to the experience was the noise.  If you are wanting a quiet dinner this is not the place.  Luckily, my wife and I have been together long enough we don't have to talk.  We can enjoy each others company in silence.  Great place,  a must try.  Ask for Sarah,  she was very polite and attentive, in fact,  all the staff was."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!  From the moment we were greeted, service and the food!  Steak 44 offers veal, which is not offered at many places these days."}
{"text":"Updating my review on this place!  We were invited back by the manager for a redo and man, was that an amazing dinner.   Start to finish...service was EXCELLENT.   I got the filet and was cooked perfecto. Partner in crime got the surf and turf and she loved everything! Said the crab legs were some of the best she's ever had.   Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is AMAZING. The lamb chops were some of the best I have ever had. The service second to none. We brought our staff members here as a \"thank you\" celebration for hitting a milestone and everyone had an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Steak 44 was hands down the best meal we have had in a long time. Steaks were perfectly cooked and the sides sounded so good we ordered three of them and they did not disappoint. The creme brûlée corn and the potatoes Dominick was unreal. Great wine selection also"}

{"text":"Lots of things were really good such as the hot bread, potatoes with cheese and onions, creamed spinach, and yummy red velvet bread pudding....DELICIOUS! but the most important part of the dinner, the main dish, was mediocre...I had the scallops, and they were somewhat small and a bit on the salty side....good, but not great for the price! My husbands bone in ribeye was good and cooked properly"}
{"text":"Celebrated my Mother-in-law's birthday here last night and give Steak 44 the following break down: Oysters: 5 stars...mmmm...delish! Caesar salad: 1 star...wilted lettuce, lukewarm, lacked flavor.  Expected much better. Steak: 20 stars...so so so so amazingly delicious.  2 of us has petite filets, one had the Waygu special.  Huge steak ($110!!!). Lots of leftovers. Sides:  4 stars.  Potatoes Dominic were good, but better the 2nd day.  Brussel sprouts amazing!!  Onion straws and baked potatoes...good. Dessert: 5 stars...strawberry butter cake.  Wow.  That's all. Drinks: 2 cocktails were perfect.  Wine selection nice.  The recommendation made by our waitress was just perfect. Decor: 5 stars  Ambiance: 3 stars...music throughout was pop music.  Should have had something that matched the decor and \"steakhouse\" feel.  Made it extra noisy. Service:  4 stars. Good, what you would expect.  One in our group felt it could have been better given the price tag.  We would have liked to know the cost of the specials when the waitress gave us the rundown.  Were surprised with the $110 cost of the Waygu steak.  It was worth it though! We received the dessert free for a birthday treat.    We really wanted to try it for a special occasion.  Had fun and awesome steak, but probably won't go back given other steakhouse and high end options in the valley we've liked better."}
{"text":"5 stars to me means you will go back and you will love your experience every time. I loved my meal here and would return as many times as possible.  The wait staff was so friendly and patient and timed everything professionally. We went to a meal with 8 people total and made a reservation for 5:30- 3 hours later we are leaving stuffed and happy!! I had the filet mignon and Brussels, whipped potatoes, snap peas, sweet potatoes and chopped salad. Everything was divine. The meat was cooked perfectly- I would recommend not getting a topping for the steak as the seasoning is so delish. The sweet potatoes taste like straight up desert with marshmallow ooey gooey on top! The Brussels were divine and came with crispy bacon. The mashbos and snap peas tasted as expected. The other important parts of a meal - BREAD and desert were both fabulous. They bring the bread out in mini cast irons- two flavors: sea salt and Parmesan. It's warm and you'll definitely try both. The desert menu looked amazing and while we didn't order any they still bring small cookies to go with the bill.  Some nice touches that make the price tag worth in include: hot towels after your meal, dark linens if you have dark pants on, a main waitress and a secondary, timing of apps / salads and food. You do not feel rushed  Price: Filet starts at $47, New York strip at $39. Sides run from $8-15. Wine bottles start at $27. For a couple to eAt with drinks I'd expect $200/meal with apps and desert.  Vibe: dark lighting, candles, decanters, brick ceilings, fancy. Definitely dressy / formal.  Negative point: the hosts were not friendly and put the party on edge. They were very curt about our entire party being there to seat which is understandable but delivery matters.   Overall I loved this place and will recommend to any friend or family who travels to Phoenix !"}
{"text":"Great service, very nice environment, rough parking at peak hours.  Salads, veggies and steak were very good.  I have had better steaks at lower prices but their steaks have unique seasoning that we really liked. It's worth a try but you can easily spend $200+ per couple, so be aware."}
{"text":"The entire experience was excellent. The service was spectacular and the food was so delicious I could hardly stop eating. The restaurant itself has a high end feel and I recommend making reservations. The wine list was extensive and I enjoyed the entire experience. If I find myself in pheonix again, I will be coming back for seconds. The steaks are cooked to perfection and the bread was properly seasoned. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in Phoenix for a fine dining experience at a steak house!  From the service, the bar tenders, the food runners, the managers, to the food.  The ambiance is eclectic and vibrant, and I'm sure on Fridays and Saturday nights it's even more special then on the nights that I have been there.  I have been there a total of 4 times thus far, and the consistency on everything has been remarkable.  If you are looking for a great steak to take someone special or to celebrate something with a bigger party Steak 44 is a fabulous choice!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for our anniversary dinner. The service was great and the food was delicious. I ordered Salmon and he ordered a steak with Mac and cheese and whipped potatoes which sides are in portions to share and they really are. Everything was so tasty down to our desert which they gave us for being there on our anniversary. A little pricey but definitely worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Easily the best steak I've ever had! And definitely one of the best meals. Had a reservation and got seated quickly on a busy Friday night. Great service and environment. Can't recommend this place enough. Absolutely worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Best. Steak. Ever. - Pretty much sums it up. The food is amazing, the service is always spot on, & their bathrooms are perfect. Doesn't get any better than Steak 44. Take the person you love & neither of you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 5th anniversary here and I cannot even begin to describe how delicious every single bite was. This is coming from someone who used to work for a competitor of the Domenic's restaurant family and was a die hard loyal to said competitor. NEVER again.  The bread they serve in the mini cast iron skillet before your meal is amazing. Our waiter warned us to only order a couple of their colossal shrimp, good thing he did because they were enormous. I had the bone in filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly and out of this world delicious. The lobster mashed potatoes were 100% on par with the rest of our meal (garlicky, lobster goodness!), as was our server. Our complimentary anniversary dessert - butter cake with strawberries, was irresistible.  The whole restaurant is gorgeous but we will definitely hit up the bar area next time - it looked very warm and welcoming (and packed)."}
{"text":"Came here with a larger group Friday night. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff was amazing, and the wonderful taste of the food still sits on my tongue.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share for the table, including meatballs, calamari, and, my favorite, the seafood tower. It's rare to get this quality of sea food in Phoenix. I then had the meatloaf afterwards and savored every single bite. Perhaps it was my misunderstanding, but I was a bit disappointed that it was a la carte and didn't come with a single thing on the side.  The only reason I can't award 5 stars right now is because of the initial seating experience. As the first in my group to arrive with a reservation, I was told I was the first one to check in and that's it - no indication of how long I'd have to wait, whether we needed our whole party to sit, etc. Instead, I just stood around waiting. When the entire party showed up, we were finally given some attention and offered 2 circular tables pushed together in the bar area or our reserved group of 8. I would have hoped for more for a larger party that had made a reservation and was sat a good 15 minutes after the reservation time.  That said, the experience afterwards was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back again soon and hope to award the final star!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak! And drinks! But don't get the meatloaf. Wife got it and it was not good. But overall this Place was great. pricey."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.  There were some nice aspects.   First impression was great to myself and my best friend. She loved the ambiance as I did. The wine list was really good and they past Veuve Champagne around for everyone for a toast at 6pm. Great impression. My husband did not necessarily have the Same opinion  We were seated and anxiously wanting to try many items.   Veal meatball appetizer sounded fabulous. We ordered one for 3.  Shares a filet.  Ordered Rack of Lamb.  Lobster mashed potatoes.  Chopped salad.  Stone crabs and  butter cake for dessert   Meatballs were dry and marginal at best.   Lobster mashed potatoes were surprisingly marginal as well.  Surprised something like this wouldn't be fabulous. Large lumps of lobster however.   Stone crabs appeared to be the best item ordered.    Rack of Lamb was good. Spiced well.  No sauce on side or even a drizzle of mint   That would have been nice.   Chopped salad was enjoyed but to me very boring. My husband enjoyed it   Nothing to speak about.   Butter cake is loved by people eating in general but not this one. Sadly it was dry. But good flavor.   I almost gave a 3 atar but a 2.5 at best  Part of disappointment was hype of new restaurant.   Overall hard pressed to believe it could compete in this market.   Bar was a good selection. They may survive on that alone. But can't be for long.   Sad and disappointed. Thought it might be my new favorite."}
{"text":"Great experience!!! I think this place need to expand the bar..lol. We arrived bit early to have some drinks before dinner but very difficult to get drinks/table/bar. Service was awesome. Our server Megan was great. She was on top of it all!!! I have to give it 4 star because two people ordered the filet medium rare but two were very different. I was also bit disappointed we weren't able to have Kumomoto Oyster we saw in display. We'll definitely return to try other intems on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must try at least once. The service is excellent! The steaks are juicy and flavorful. Crab cakes are melt in your mouth goodness. They offer endless selection of sides to go with your meal. Remember to save room for dessert. Out waiter gave us 3 complimentary desserts today for thanksgiving and that just put it over the top! Simply amazing food and service. Don't forget the oysters...so fresh!"}
{"text":"Man.  This is the best meat I've had since my experience last year in an Austin steakhouse (don't tell my husband).  ;)  We came here for a pharmaceutical industry talk.  Not only did we have what seemed like an endless infusion of the delicious cab sauv (perfectly smooth and a great pairing with the steak), we also were treated to spectacular meatballs (they're HUGE!), perfectly cooked calamari (not even a fishy taste or a chewy sensation), and a delicious caesar salad.  I had the New York Strip, medium, which was served on a sizzling plate.  I loved the fact that you can get your meat a little more undercooked than you normally do and then cut it up into pieces and finish searing it to perfection on top of your dinner plate.  The flavor was outstanding, and the outside was cooked perfectly to a crispy, juicy finish.  I also took a bite of the petite filet mignon, which was absolutely delicious.  They were both so good, I'm not even sure which one I would choose next time.  The mashed potatoes and spinach were great sides, but honestly the meat would have been fine without the sides in my mind.  We finished off a delicious meal with some sort of caramel cake topped with vanilla ice-cream.  They almost had to roll me out of the restaurant, we had so much food.  The setting is awesome as well.  We were in the back in a group room with a powerpoint projector, but we got to pass by some cool tables with candles and glass windows, and we also walked past an area where they had some fresh seafood laid out for examination.  It looks like a perfect place for a date, and I hear the seafood is excellent.  5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"My first time to this restaurant was today for Mother's Day Brunch and it was divine. Started with the king crab on avocado salsa which was different but very good.  Had the Shetland Salmon with fresh asparagus and all I can say is that it was perfect!  It was the best salmon I've ever had. I'm still feeling blissfully happy after eating that.  The service was impeccable!  Everyone of the staff, and I do mean eveyine, was friendly, cheerful and just pleasant all around.  It was expensive, not something I can do regularly, but I do plan on returning for round two in a few months."}
{"text":"During my visit to Arizona I stumbled across this amazing steakhouse restaurant, Steak 44. My vision of a perfect steakhouse came true at Steak 44. The bar scene was vibrant, hip and filled with beautiful people. Every seat and table was filled, hot women everywhere, alcohol flowing, it was just amazing.   Now that the bar scene is covered let's talk about the perfect dinning experience. This was the perfect dinning experience, we were ushered to our table which turned out to be a private booth with glass enclosures. This allowed our party to talk without disturbing others.   Our server Nicole was amazing, all knowing of everything \"Steak 44\" from the history of the restaurant, to everything on the menu. I've visited many steakhouse restaurants and I have never had complete 5 Star service like I had at Steak 44.  I ordered the bone in rib-eye, bare with me this is the way I order my steak. Medium rare, blackened, very charred on the outside, and yes it was cooked exactly the way I asked to perfection.  Try the hassle-back potatoes they go great with a steak.   I so rarely give restaurants 5 stars, Steak 44 is one of those rare establishments that is much deserving of a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse I have ever been to and I have been to many! Yum! Their lobster mashed potatoes and filet mignon were out of this world. The aged steak was tasted in every bite. Watch out for the hot plate when it is served though. I burned my finger on the plate and had a serious burn that turned into a bubble days later. One of my fingers was dipped in a glass of ice while eating. All good though! Things happen! But the food was so good, it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"A almost perfect steakhouse. Staff was impeccable. Drinks were on the money. The salads chop and Cesar were super tasted. Had the lamb chops which came on a super hot plate. Awesome.  Cannot review the steak. Leave room for desert. The donut tree and dipping sauce were tasty."}
{"text":"Incredible dinner! Pricey yes but worth it and still less expensive than City Hall Steakhouse and so much better. The food is awesome starting with the soft rolls made in a cast iron pan, so buttery with a hint of salt and garlic. Great beat salad made perfect with pistachio nuts.  Our steak were amazing so very flavorful and juicy cooked medium rare as requested. I had the 22oz bone-in rib eye ($55 here $60 at City Hall) and my husband had the Kansas City strip. The side we choose was the roasted sweet potatoes that are made with bourbon and topped with marshmallow; oh so good. It was our anniversary and they offered our choice of a complimentary dessert. We chose the warm vanilla caramel cake it was very warm fresh dense cake with caramel topping and the ice cream just starting to melt with a side of luscious whipped cream. We are very picky about our coffee and they have great coffee and when we asked our server where they purchase the coffee from he responded with a special blend from  Cave Creek Coffee Company. We have been using Cave Creek Coffee Companies organic coffee for years and it is excellent!The food was perfection as was the service. This was our 4th visit and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Steak 44 lived up to and surpassed all of my expectations. First off, go in expecting to spend at least $150++ per person, especially if you wish to order wine. It's totally worth it but just know it's UBER expensive. The crispy shrimp appetizer is TO DIE FOR. Thankfully there's a small portion, which I got since I was dining alone and wanted to try so many things. I got the petit filet, Oscar style (with crab and béarnaise). Omfg was it delicious. My favorite side was the  double baked truffle potato. Creamed spinach was yummy, though heavy. The corn creme brulee is a must try. Will go back as soon as I can afford it!!"}
{"text":"We had the great pleasure of Dining at Steak 44 this week! I have to say I was very impressed from the moment we walked in the door we were immediately seated at our table of 4 and the minute we sat down the excellent staff took care of us like we were family! There was never a half empty water glass or drink that wasn't being refilled . Every item we used from appetizer plate to extra silverware was removed and replaced with out a rush but at just the perfect time like a beautiful orchestra there was never a hiccup in the flow. As soon as we were seated they brought a skillet warm bread that was amazing . For our appetizer we had a King crab & avocado stack that I could have devoured on my own but decided to share. Next we had the Steak house Caesar salad with egg! My egg was poached to perfection so delicious and runny it was a great compliment to the Caesar salad that I'm never having a plain salad again . I ordered the 12oz bone in Filet Mignon my husband and friend had the 22oz Bone in Ribeye and my friend ordered the New Bedford Sea Scallops. All the dishes arrived on 500 degree plates and our steaks were sizzling with the aroma of Deliciousness you just can't describe but with have to experience yourself! My friend's scallops were very fresh and plump and juicy. We had 4 sides The loaded baked potato that came with butter cheese bacon chives and sour cream so you could pick and choose and I chose them all. Side 2 The creamed spinach , Side 3 the sautéed wild mushrooms and Side 4 the asparagus fries . All the side were amazing and fresh and devoured by us all . We ended dinner with a nice espresso and a gorgeous Fried banana split. I can't say enough about Steak 44 other than it was the most amazing night the food was over the top delicious and the staff is 5 Star plus . Thank you Steak 44 we will definitely be returning you have made us customers for life."}
{"text":"Not impressed; very pricey, horrible pkg & too many better options (Hillstone, Houston's to name a few). Great face place tho :)"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix a few months back for work and I still think about this place so I figured I would review it.  4 of use had dinner and all shared our sides and not one disappointed.  The corn creme burlee was amazing.  Bone in Filet I had could not have been prepared better!  The place is expensive but you really get what you pay for at this place."}
{"text":"The shrimp was honestly some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend the corn creme brûlée as well- it was exquisite. There's also a super delicious potato dish with onion & gruyere (I think) that is positively to die for. Excellent wine selection and fabulous service as well! I only wish it were less dark / better lit in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for our anniversary. Service was exceptional, the food was the best we have ever had, and the atmosphere was very romantic, great for the occasion!It's definitely pricey, but worth every penny! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Becoming a factory is the feeling I got during my last visit this past week.  We have been many times and enjoy the food.  They crammed us into our table and then the service was scripted and not personal.  The waitstaff continually bumped our chairs put trays next to our table with splattering butter and then refuse from others.  The team seemed so task driven the forgot about the customer.  Even when they checked on us it was in passing and not attentive. Next stop in Phoenix will be to a different restaurant.  Time to try something new."}
{"text":"I guess I'm spoiled with steak houses because I'm from Vegas but I really don't know what all the hype is about. It may be because it's the new hip and trendy place to see and be seen in Phoenix but I'd rather eat in a hole in the wall with flavorful food than an \"atmosphere\" place with expensive, salty cuts of meat."}
{"text":"The experience was stellar! This place makes you feel like your worth a million dollars! The food again stellar! Our steak, and sides were amazing. The sides are a-la-cart however they are large for 2-3 easily. Their Cesar salad was the best i have ever had, and i have eaten at G.Ramsey restaurants for comparison. The Service again stellar! Service you would expect form top rated restaurants. My wife would go to the restroom, some how the server would know that and come refill our waters, re-fold her napkin and de-crumb (not sure if there's a better word) the table. The drinks again stellar. My Grey Goose Dirty Martini was dialed into perfection, with almost another 1/2 serving in the shaker left with the drink at the table. The atmosphere and decor again stellar! The decor and architecture was very transitional leaning towards modern. Everything was clean, neat and pressed.   It was my birthday dinner and they even gave me a nice Happy Birthday handwritten and signed card from the Hostess and Server. (Not necessary, but definitely added to the feeling like a million bucks atmosphere.)  Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Went without reservations right before happy hour ended.  Decided to stay at bar and no regrets.  Bartender and support staff far exceeded expectations.  Although crowded, the service and food were outstanding. Very nice place!!! And, the hostess and managers made you feel very welcome for the short wait.  Highly recommend for food, drinks and service.  Ed from Texas"}
{"text":"We tried Steak 44 for the first time base on a referral from a friend. It was a difficult decision for us because we have another steakhouse that we love. This is one of the best experiences we've ever had. From the greeting by the hostess, our friendly and professional server, all assistants, and the manager who stopped by multiple time. It felt like a great dinner party with friends and family. The food couldn't have been better. We are now huge fans and will be back weekly."}
{"text":"The BEST steak that I have had in years. The service was astounding. It was my son's celebration dinner for graduating magna cum laude. This experience was top of the class!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are definitely worth the price. As always outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently as I just moved to the area from Las Vegas and wanted to find some really nice trendy upscale restaurants and steakhouses to frequent every week. Have gotten tired of not finding some good ones and driving to the ones I frequented all the way in Las Vegas. (Yes that's how much I love good food that I would travel to other cities just for dinner) I've gotten to know some people out here as friends and they recommended I check out Steak 44. I went on a weekend night so I understood it would be very busy. I only gave a 3 Star review for my first time since I'm hoping it was just a fluke with my visit and willing to go visit again during a slow weekday and another time during a busy night to see how service goes. The front hosts were very welcoming and friendly greeting me as I walked in. The bartender who took my order I noticed had notice me get my seat at the bar followed by another group but tended to them first. I patiently waited for a few minutes before someone eventually took my drink and offered the menu. I had noticed she sort of ignored the two gentlemen sitting next to me as well as we both mentioned it to each other. I ordered the crispy chicken entree but was a bit disappointed in it to be honest. The outside was crispy as to be expected but deep in the middle of it was dry. My side order of the Mac and cheese was the only item that I felt was good and the bread. That's another thing the bartender forgot too. She first forgot to even offer me any when I saw that she offered another couple sitting to my right. The first bartender I barely saw and when I did see she didn't check up on me on how my meal was, refill my drink. Nothing. It was another bartender that did stay on top of this. Little things like this does annoy me but I'm still willing to give them a few more visits to see how things go and just hope this is just a bad night even if it was my first visit."}
{"text":"This is the second time my wife and I have ate here and it is absolutely delicious!! I got the Wagyu New York Strip and my wife got the small New York Strip. Small in a understatement btw, they were very healthy sized steaks. The Wagyu was an absolute treat. By far the best steak I've ever had. The New York Stripe was also very juicy and very good.  The service was also top notch. Our reservation was at 7:30 and we showed up early at 7:00 intending to wait in the bar, but they got us right in and didn't have to wait at all! Our waiters we had were knowledgeable,prompt, and very friendly.  I would recommend this place to everyone and will definitely be going back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"We made our reservations based on Yelp reviews, and we weren't disappointed.  To start, they have a terrific wine and cocktail selection -- but they had me at Wild Turkey!  It's a hoppin' place, but we were seated immediately (with reservations) and the staff started attending to us right away with a small skillet of hot rolls!  By the time we had a couple of drinks, our salads had arrived.  I had the wedge and my wife went with the beet.  Both were fine, as salads go.  For our main, I had the 16 oz New York and my wife had the Sea Bass.  The steak was prepared perfectly, but slightly under-flavored for my liking.  My wife loved her Sea Bass.  We shared a potato/cheese/hashbrown thingy (sorry, forgot what they called it) side and cream spinach.  Their side dishes are the bomb!  We are recent transplants from Dallas, so I would compare this place to Del Frisco's -- but perhaps not quite as upscale.  The Del Frisco's steaks have more flavor, but Steak 44 dominates with their sides.  We are anxious to return and try others -- along with a few more shots of Wild Turkey!"}
{"text":"Best steak in town. Service is always great. Medium rare filet is excellent along with the side veggies"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. I highly recommend the bone in ribeye (medium rare). The shrimp and oysters are amazing. I have not seen such big pieces of seafood since I lived back east. Wine selection was great, recommend the zin. Don't forget about the butter cake dessert. I took that home because I was so full. I even got a call by the Manager the next day (Memorial Day in fact) and asked how our dinner was. Impressive I have to say."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? To tell the story of how great a love can be -Andy Williams. This is how feel about my experience at this wonderful establishment last night with my 2 best friends. We were there to celebrate a birthday, and the importance of this celebration was not lost on Daniel, the assistant manager. We got warm welcome from everyone. The place was beautifully decorated. We were lucky to have a table with full view of the open kitchen. Being a huge foodie fan, I was over the top with happiness with the location of our table. On to the food. We started off with some blue point oysters which were amazingly fresh and delicious. We were tempted to order more, if it wasn't for the fact that we ordered a lot of food.  Our next dish was the Rhode Island calamari and shrimp. It was perfectly seasoned. The little kick we get from the jalapeño was the perfect contrast. The  super colossal shrimps were out of this world. It's a meal in itself. Thank you Daniel for sending these deliciousness to our table. We feel the love. The 22 oz bone-in ribeye cooked medium push per our request. It was tender and flavorful. The seared ahi tuna was light and refreshing. Alaskan crab & shrimp mash potato , and the roasted brussels sprouts  were the perfect accompaniment for the steak and ahi tuna. The tree with beignet blossoms totally wrapped up our perfect night. Thank you sous chef Hung Hoang for the wonderful treat. I'll be back for sure!! Bon Appetit!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night and it was packed. Food and Service were amazing. Order their lobster Mac and cheese. It's the best I ever had. Steaks are worth every penny and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour choice - try the crispy shrimp appetizer and 2 lemon martinis - quality and taste of shrimp are amazing - large martini is indescribably good - servers are all excellent -\"service is 1st class - 4 drinks and 2 large - meal size - shrimp appetizers - $60"}
{"text":"Nicholas did not treat us equally to his other customers.  Just because we ordered cheaper meals than other patrons doesn't mean we should be treated any differently.  Normally we get a bottle a wine, dessert etc. His tip reflected his lack of equality, normally we tip 20% this time we tipped 15%.  4th time eating at Steak 44, worst experience we've had thus far.  Hope we get a different server next time."}
{"text":"When you're going to spend serious money on a dinner for a special occasion, it had better be outstanding!  No mistakes, regardless of what you order.  That is Steak 44.  Every time we have gone there, the appetizers, the entrees, the sides, the wine, the desserts .. all perfect.  No snooty service either.  It's not nestled in the foothills like a few other restaurants in the corner.  For all intents and purposes, it's at the end of a strip mall.  But once you go inside, the ambiance totally envelops you and you feel like you've suddenly walked into a 5-star resort.  It's always packed, but somehow never noisy.  This is the blueprint for other steakhouses to follow."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had!!!!! Great build out.  Beautifully decorated. Previously, BLT Steakhouse and LG's in Palm Springs were our faves.   We sat towards the back by the kitchen where it might be a little more private and quiet than the front of the restaurant.  Great service. Great drinks...$14 drink that actually gave me a nice buzzzzzzz.  The bread that comes out was fan flippin tastic!!!!!! Be careful not to eat any more than 2 pieces of the bread or u will ruin your dinner!!! I went with 8oz filet med well and it was so perfect and tender.  All sides were yummy.  Asparagus fries were a nice surprise.  Mmmmmmm. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I personally like Mastro's steakhouse for the price vs this place. However there are very similar contrasts.   Got a 8 oz cut steak that really looked like a 6 oz cut  Its alot smaller dinning room that mastro's however nicely remodel For a first time experince it was ok again the price for the cut of meat was about 30 almost 40 or so dollars if I want to pay that price I think Ill end up at mastro's but since vegas has nice steak places and no longer there expcept on visits then yea.   Will give it another chance, The quality of food gets 5 stars however portion size makes it 3 stars.. and bye judging bye some photos it looks smaller side stuff"}
{"text":"In my perspective, Steak 44 has been the BEST dining experience and food gasm thus far. This and Lucky's in Montecito, CA are very close in comparable. The atmosphere of the environment was awesome, the only improvement I could suggest is the valets with their greeting and manner and all that sort but it's a another company/service and not in house. For appetizers, my friend and I had the oysters and lobster combo and the braised pork belly. The seafood was EXCELLENT and pork belly was best thus far. When it came to the steaks I had the filet mignon rare and my partner had the new york, in my opinion again the New York steak was much tastier and THE BEST steak/new york I had ever. Paired with asparagus fries and Brussel sprouts. Have to admit the Brussel sprouts were the only dish I wasn't all over, but that is okay. Drinks/cocktails were on point and that s'mores in a jar, can't go wrong. Price was expensive but you pat for your service. Shout out to our server, Shaun for showing us an amazing experience first time, these guys really show what it's like to be a five star restaurant, from the food runners, bussers etc, hostess to even the manager (had to complement them for their success and my happiness) Shaun even went above and beyond to do some personal favors which was phenomenal and of course took care of him with gratuity as we should all for an excellent course. Thank you Steak 44 for a memorable and FIVE STAR dining experience!"}
{"text":"Rude staff food mediocre at best. People that think they have money and really don't.  California rejects. Over priced and lame!!!  Actually this place is awful.  Bunch of people that think they have money and are rude and obnoxious.  My waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Made reservations for birthday dinner for a Friday night. The restaurant was very busy.  First time to this restaurant since it was cork and cleaver. A few changes and updated decor for steak 44 compared to cork and cleaver. I liked the entrance where it had many of the cleaver menus from the previous restaurant hung on the wall.  The first noticeable thing as we sat down at a table was the loud talking from the restaurants where you could barely hear the other person sitting across the table. Almost to the point where it was becoming annoying that the people were so loud.  The fresh bread that started the meal was hot and fresh and delicious. Ordered the bone in ribeye, loaded baked potatoes and asparagus. The ribeye came out sizzling and stay that way for at least 10 minutes into the meal. The baked potato came with two potatoes in the order and was fully loaded like it said it would be. The ribeye was perfectly prepared juicy and tender. One of the better rib eye steaks that I've had in quite some time.  A few very nice touches in detail at the restaurant were that they used crumb blade to clean off the table many times and after the meal brought hot warm towels to clean your hands.  Since we were there celebrating my birthday they comped a dessert which we chose the red velvet bread pudding. This was exceptional and would recommend  this dessert.  Overall I would rank this restaurant in the new hot business category. Highly recommend this restaurant if you have not been there food service atmosphere and overall customer satisfaction is at it's highest."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday few weeks ago. Thankfully, I had made prior reservation and was somewhat dressy. The restaurant opened at 5p.m., we arrived at 4:45pm and the line was already out the door. This is clearly a high end restaurant. While we were waiting at the bar area, they gave us glasses of water prior to seating instead of pressuring us to order alcohol drink. Aww...the little detail that makes customers happy. Well done Steak 44.   For appetizers, we ordered crab legs for 4. It was served in cold ice with hot radish dipping. Crab legs were already cracked open saving you time from making a mess. For main entrée, I ordered their Prime Ribs. It has got to be one of the best prime ribs I've ever had. It was tender, well seasoned, tasty, generous in portion. It was cooked exactly to my liking. For dessert, we all shared the rich chocolate ice-cream, Gelato and the ice-cream desserts that my friend got. We ended the meal with rich coffee. The entire night was just simply perfect.  The bill wasn't cheap but was worth every penny. I will most definitely come back here again."}

That is the major differentiator for this place, I am a foodie and a steak lover and this place had amazing steak. We resolved the service issue by talking to the head manager and then we were attended to hand and foot."}
