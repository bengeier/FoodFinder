{"text":"Service rapide et courtois, portions très généreuses par rapport aux prix. Leur sandwich au poulet (mariné et cuit sur charbon) est vraiment divin !"}
{"text":"Très bien mais fait une fausse promotion d'un rabais de 5$ lors d'une vente trottoir sur tout le menu alors qu'il est écrit en tout petit que c'est sur les commande de 20$ et plus.

J'aimais bien, mais je n'y retournerai plus."}
{"text":"Grosse déception. Nous avons pris différents combos. C'est gras, très gras. J'aime encore mieux aller au Coq au coin de la rue."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken in Montréal , I would recommend this place to anyone who would want to have good chicken in Montréal."}
{"text":"This is a Portuguese chicken rotisserie, you know what you're getting! They have their home piri piri sauce, which I wish it had been a bit more piquant. The food is generally good, fresh, the place is often busy with people. 

I usually take my juicy bird to go, but the place has tables and it occasionally gets busy."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, nice people... Overall I liked the experience and would return. I only had one meal here so my comments are limited, but the Churrasco chicken leg meal I had was delicious, simple, affordable, and the portion was good as well."}
{"text":"J'adore, j'ai amené plusieurs personnes à cette endroit et tous on aimé autant que moi. Vraiment trop bon!!!"}
{"text":"Recently picked up a chicken meal to go. Chicken was tasty, sauce was nice and spicy. Only downside...the fries. Next time I'm taking rice or potatoes. Let others have the shoe leather."}
{"text":"I usually don't give five stars when it's the first time I go somewhere as I want to be sure I'll get the same amazing experience the next time, but Piri-Piri really impressed me.

It may not be a fancy restaurant, but this rotisserie is the proof that fast food doesn't always mean crappy food. First, a line-up to a restaurant is, most of the time, a good indicator of the place. When you enter this little restaurant, on top of the good smell of the chicken cook on charcoal, you'll be welcome by a friendly, and enthusiast staff.

I took a Chorizo sausage sandwich, with fries, and salad. Before going to the cashier to pay my due, I was intrigued by what looked like to be potatoes with some sort of dressing. One of the staff look at me, told me that I'll like these, and put some on my plate for free! All the food, from French fries, to these yummy potatoes, and my sausages were amazing, and really tasty. I was with 3 other friends who took different meals, and were also happy, and really impress with them.

As a social media enthusiast, I'm always happy to see merchant having specials or offers for people that check-in. Not only they were giving free soft drink to people who do it on Facebook, they were actively promoting it to their customers. It was the first time I saw a place really use this strategy proactively!

So at the end:
- A fast, and friendly service;
- A yummy, and really inexpensive meal;
- A clean, and nice venue on Masson;
- A really good surprise!

Even if I'm not going in this neighborhood quite often, I'll go back to this restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"I been there many times and the food is simply amazing. 
The service is also very good and the staff super nice! Always a great experience!
The portions are VERY big and i often get a takeout box and then i have leftover for lunch the next day! 
Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Nondescript Portuguese chicken. Does the job. Potatoes are a bit overcooked to the point of mushiness, most of what flavour is in the chicken comes from the eerily bright red sauce. I needed calories to bike across town; it was indeed food and contained protein and carbohydrates. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"J'aime bien Piri Piri, la nourriture est très bonne et les prix sont très compétitifs. Pour apporter ou mangée sur le pouce, mais c'est trop tassé pour les conversations."}
{"text":"I went here for take out and when I came home they gave me the wrong order.I was annoyed because I repeated the order 2x in the resto.I ended up eating some because i was starving and tossing the rest.I called the next day for a manager and was told none was on today call tom.Forget it..very disappointing."}
{"text":"PiriPiri's chicken is really finger licking good.  Their sauce is to die for and keeps me coming back on a regular basis.  I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Plenty tasty food for the price. Sauce could have been hotter, but that's just my taste. Food was very tasty, especially the chicken and the potatoes."}
{"text":"Good, fast food. Large portions and quick service. Wish the sauce was a bit spicier but definitely worth the visit"}
{"text":"Kind of overrated. Not nearly as good as coco Rico or romados. The salad had dirt in it and the fries had far too much black pepper. There was a strange spiced orange colored glaze  on the chicken that we didn't like"}
{"text":"Very gluten free friendly place. Also peanut free. They were helpful with navigating the allergies. 

We went in because there was a huge line which is usually a great sign! (And it was).  You can see all the chicken being cooked on the grill. You line up and order at the counter. Rice, potatoes, salad with chicken. All really amazing. Flan also gluten free for dessert. Lots of food at a really great price. Love this place."}
