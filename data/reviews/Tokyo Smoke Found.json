{"text":"Terrible staff was ignored when I first entered and the place was empty!!! I started to touch the merchandise for attention. Finally got \"the can I help you\" from the owner. He showed me some sweatpants and a cannabis grinder. The merchandise was very poor quality everything was black and had a red oblong dot on it. I Kicked the tires on some overpriced metal drug pipes. The pipes looked like someone crushed a car exhaust with a forklift and then proceeded to drill 3 holes into it I said goodbye and left to find a heady."}
{"text":"Latte is ok, slightly worse than your typical k-cup.  The Thai ice tea is horrendous.  It's a mix of cold peach ice tea with condense milk.  If you are imagining how it taste, count yourself lucky that you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"I used to walk by on my way to work and now I think of all the missed chances at proper caffeination. Sadly I don't head that way in the morning anymore but I might actually consider going out of my way on extra grumpy mornings!   Great little spot! Friendly service! Delicious coffee! I will be back for sure! I kind of want to go back right now.   They had a little bowl of candy for the humans and a little bowl of dog treats, charming!"}
{"text":"Best, coffee, in, Toronto.  Got a west coast vibe, nicely situated to avoid main street traffic. I am glad it's not right by my house or else I will have to have their coffee everyday. :)"}
{"text":"Very interesting \"coffee\" shop. There's not many seats. It's more like a coffee window. The coffee is good. There're a lot of smoke related tools on display."}
{"text":"Very good coffee in a convenient location.  I bike pass this place regularly and in the morning there's a healthy lineup outside for the coffee counter.  I like that this is the original location, and there's a neighbourhood cafe feel to the place, as opposed to the more touristy Queen West location.  Lineups can be a bit long but the coffee is worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Cool little spot tucked into a residential area with a good-sized patio. I happened across this place looking for good coffee before heading back to the States. No real breakfast food, but they do have cookies and biscotti. I got a cappuccino (technically not on the menu, just asked for it) and it was creamy and not too hot. The espresso itself is medium to dark with earthy notes. Two medium cappuccinos cost $8.26. I would come back if I lived here."}
{"text":"Cool spot, coffee was priced appropriately for a trendy spot. I personally didn't like the coffee but there was a long line of people I'm sure who do!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is hidden away from the main King Street and initially when it first opened I did not realise what it was. Set up within what looks like a car garage I eventually ventured in.  Firstly it is a pretty unique space, passing itself off as a boutique store inside, with a mix of hipster, retro gear and deco on sale. Considering that the entrance is wide open the inside is still cosy and warm enough to work from the one long communal table.  Where it wins though is on the coffee. They really make good coffee. For those who drink enough of the stuff you can buy a weekly pass for $20 which gives you unlimited drinks for that week."}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this tiny coffee place near my office, the latte is amazing and the staff is really really friendly.   They also sell original weed grinders and other pretty vintage stuff. The worst part about this place is that I think I'm gonna be spending money on their lattes every day! =)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the city. Their staff is amazing. Their coffee is good. The best thing about them is the vibe they bring, there is no other like it in the city.  Must, check, out!"}
{"text":"Adorable little coffee shop with great coffee and yummy treats. Sandwiches and heartier food items are available during the warmer months.   Tea lovers take note, they can't do London Fogs but that doesn't make me love them any less."}
{"text":"The guy running the shop made fun of my mustache (I have trouble growing out my mustache). I was there for about 20 minutes before he kicked me out for \"totally killing the vibe with my whack stache\"."}
{"text":"This has been my coffee shop of choice for the past year and I have had nothing but good experiences. The coffee is great and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"I go here twice per day, and it's one of my favorite moments in the day. Lovely people work. All of them remember my name and my usual order, and they have some pretty good deals for regulars.  Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLY SLOW SERVICE.   I just waited in line for 15 minutes to order. There was only a group of 3 people in front of me. When I arrived 2 of the 3 already had their drinks. I HAD TO WAIT 15 minutes for the Barista to make 2 iced coffees. 15 MINUTES!!!  The Barista seemed more interested in flirting w the female customer, and talk about his new tattoo ideas and places he wants them, rather than do his damn job and make the actual drinks.  I finally get my turn to order, and I order and iced tea. He then informs me that the tea has to steep and I'll have to wait \"a bit\". I can only assume at least another 10-15 wait for my drink.  So I just walked away. Thanks for nothing Tokyo Smoke. I will literally never come back and take my business to Starbucks. At least they know how to make drinks and serve customers in a timely manor.  Ridiculous stupid hipster coffee shops.  I guess only hipsters without jobs actually have the time to wait 30 minutes for a damn iced tea."}
{"text":"Even though I live around the block I'm never coming back here.  Went in to grab one of those overpriced cold press juices they have. I buy it on debit and leave. I shake the bottle and all these moldy specks appear; I keep shaking and they don't disappear. Expiration date is two days ago. Apparently pulling rotten inventory from the fridge is not a priority here.   Upon returning, the staff:  A. Don't know how to refund debit purchases at first and spend a few minutes texting for help.   B. Eventually attempt to refund me the charged amount and not my 15% tip (I'll never again tip for a bottled beverage purchase EVER at a cafe again).  C. Very likely didn't refund me correctly since the refund amount hasn't appeared on my bank statement. EDIT: Hours later and no refund, which means they 100% straight up took my money for free.  So go to Tokyo Smoke if you want to have to inspect expiry dates with zero confidence that anyone here gives a crap either way, or only bring cash knowing full-well getting a debit refund won't happen, and also if you've been dying to spend 11.50 dollars and receive precisely 0.00 in return for it!"}
{"text":"Cool little coffee shop on a quiet road.  Stop by here every now and then while biking past."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and hot chocolate. Interesting gifts. Friendly baristas. Very unique shipping container building. Recommended."}
{"text":"Tokyo smoke...Vietnamese coffee...Australian barista...only in Toronto! Love the outside seating, comfortable people watching and the dining table inside.  They even have lego sets of famous sights in Japan and Korea for purchase!"}
{"text":"Perfect coffee. Friendly baristas. Love that their cannabis products are more Holt Renfrew than head shop. Very design forward. Open one in Parkdale please!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is very hidden from the main street and the shop is extremely small.   The space was quite unique. Inside was like a boutique with a mix of hipster/decors/limited edition lego sets/gifts that you can purchase. There's also some smoking accessories and I believe they are trying to get the license to sell weeds.There isn't much seat except for the long communal table in the middle.   They make pretty dam good coffee!! I got the creme brulee and unlike the one at Starbucks (where they use syrup), the barista dusted brown sugar on top and blow torched it. Pretty unique as the slightly sweet foam will hit your tongue first, then follow with a slight bitterness from the coffee.   I don't recommend the Vietnamese coffee. I saw the barista used condensed milk (which is correct) but he also put milk in it - A NONONO in Vietnamese coffee. The overall drink wasn't sweet enough to be considered as Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Great people. Great coffee. They always remember my name and order and share a great conversation while I order. Love this team!"}
{"text":"quaint little coffee shop in the middle of a residential area! i love how there are seatings out front and on the inside. the coffee i had was full of strong, rich flavour. i had a small cappuccino and only cost 3.5$ which is average. would come back to try their specials such as thai ice tea, and iced vietnamese coffee"}
{"text":"My 3rd spot for Tokyo Smoke in the city and this one was not obvious to find.  It's buried a few streets away from Trinity Bellwoods on a quiet side street.  With Sam James and White Squirrel coffee right on Queen St, this spot is definitely the lesser known for the area.  This location is a bit different from the first two spots... it's definitely a take out spot as it's more of a coffee counter in a warehouse space that faces outside in the summer.  Inside, there is maybe 3 bar stools on a very shallow shelf to drink but it's mainly a store for their cannabis items.  Compared to the Queen St location, this is probably half the space.  My vice is coffee and not the cannabis here BUT if you are curious, the staff seems quite knowledgeable to help you.  One of the barista was very helpful to another couple who were looking at the different pipes and other items to purchase.  Service here is prompt and quick.  Sometimes their credit machine is down so it can be cash at times.  There is 2 outdoor picnic tables that you can sit down.  There's no shade so in the summer, it can get hot very fast.  One negative thing and it's not a knock on Tokyo... but rather the neighbourhood.  Tokyo smoke is dog friendly as they have a water bowl out for dogs but they also have some dog treats in a jar.  Terrible thing... some really dumb owners leave the bags of dog crap in the line up area for the coffee.  REALLY?  It's just mindblowing how selfish some people are.  Anyhow... back to the coffee.  I love Tokyo Smoke on Queen and Assembly.  It's just a delicious cup.  Here... there's something different.  Flat White - I know they use the same beans as the other 2 Tokyo Smoke spots I went to (Assembly and Queen St W) but after coming here twice, I think there's something different on how they pull the espressos.  I've had their flat whites twice and it pulls more acidic and sour than the other spots.  I'm not sure why as I loved my drink in Assembly.  I have the admit the second pour was far closer to ones Ive had before but maybe it's the machine?  Either way, it's a harder drink to be so acidic.  3.5/5  Dirty Chai Latte - They use Chaiwala honey chai... this is just awesome.  And they steep it enough time to give it the robust ginger and lightly sweet honey taste.  The star anise does comes out as well.  The problem was the espresso shot put in there... it just pulled the drink towards the harsh sour side.  I think it must be the machine that is doing the espresso shots weirdly or that their grinder needs a cleaning.  3.5/5  With it being hidden from the main streets, I can see this is a little forgotten when rhyming off coffee in the area.  It's definitely above average for a cup of coffee but hoping something changes for the better soon!"}
{"text":"The coffee shop is in a converted alleyway.  Explains how narrow it is.  Coffee itself, so good.  Strong flavour, but super smooth. I ordered a latte, and the hubby ordered a Vietnamese coffee.  My one minor complaint is that my latte, the bubbles were a bit big, so the foamy part wasn't so smooth.  The hubby's Vietnamese coffee was super strong!  I assumed it would be too sweet, because typically Vietnamese coffee has condensed milk in there.  But nope, just super strong and smooth coffee. Favourite coffee place down on the west end of Toronto."}
{"text":"Coffee/tea, clothing and smoking accessories... What an unusual combination found in this tiny hipster shop. Despite the pics, there were no chairs inside when we went yesterday (Sunday). But there are seats outside and luckily it was a warmer winter day so sitting outside wasn't unbearably cold.   I'm still not quite sure what the focus is here but people are coming in for coffee so this seems like the main attraction.    We discovered they house their very own men's fashion line on our way to the washroom. The door way leading to the other small room was kept closed so this definitely can be missed.   Their fashion collection was small with limited sizes and prices are up there for any local designer, about $600 for a suit sweater and I believe it was $200 or $300 for a simple white dress shirt. We chatted to who seem like the owner and apparently in the next month they would be licensed to sell weed. This would make sense and compliment the smoking accessories in their shop.   They have a good selection of unique aromatic and floral teas to choose from and you can even smell it before you choose your tea.   Ordered: Creme brûlée latte. It came in a small paper cup for ~$5.30. One of the most expensive drinks on their small menu.   The process of watching them torch sugar on top of the latte was neat but the latte itself was nothing special. The intention was to harden the sugar but the latte was hot that I didn't sense the harden sugar when I drank it. I just mixed the sugar into the latte so that I can actually taste the sweetness as oppose to it floating on top of the foam. Well that really killed the purpose of torching.   The retired gentleman who served us was friendly and helpful. As a coffee shop, I would appreciate it a lot more if there were more comfortable seating inside and that the latte was less gimmicky. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing and better to treat this as on-the-go but even then I'm not sure whether I'll prefer this over sbux or Aroma."}
{"text":"Passionate about their community and coffee. Delicious (although pricey) drinks. Fun location and summer seating on Adelaide! Very excited for their expansions."}
{"text":"Head inside to get your smoke on. Otherwise, the bench outside is a great place to drink your coffee. Say hi to Yoshi, he will brighten your day!"}
{"text":"Where else can you get great coffee, fresh pressed juice, weed grinders, men's shirts and a vintage Hermes beach bag? I'm going to go ahead and guess nowhere... except for this joint.  I've popped in here a few times over the past couple of weeks, and I love everything about this wonderfully weird and chic, dark gray space. I'll be back often for coffee and keep it in mind next time I need a unique gift."}
