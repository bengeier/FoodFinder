{"text":"One of my favourite bars was great food great prices great environment and then they all of a sudden raise the price on everything by 3 dollars .  would rather go to more trendy pubs and get food that they actually prep, and take time into their menu rather then have everything frozen and deep fried and hamburgers, steak sandwiches . for the amount they're charging now I would assume alot of house made products which isn't the case so for the price now I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"I have never actually stepped foot in the place, but used Skip The Dishes to have my order delivered. I got the artichoke dip to start and the Sante Fe chicken burger with mashed potatoes as my entree. The dip was not good. It was drowning in cheddar cheese and mushy tomato pieces, and wasn't creamy like I expected it to be. Not exactly a great start. I bit into my burger to find that it was extremely greasy and not so tasty. The chicken was undercooked and almost slimy. The best part of my meal was the mashed potatoes, which were fantastic, but not a saving grace. I'm not sure if my order was rushed because it was a delivery or what, but it was bad enough that I won't be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Just ordered their lasagna and calamari off skip the dishes and it was medicore - good. A little sad the lasagna didn't have a bit of ricotta though but other than that the calamari I recommend eat only in restaurant to retain crispiness but still not bad a bit more seasoning on calamari would have been best! Overall I Would order from here again and try something different :)"}
