{"text":"Moved to Scottsdale recently and I have found a great place to eat and drink.  The staff and owner always go out of their way to make me feel welcome.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice casual setting, booths  outside, good burgers and salads, and now full (and friendly) service, what's not to like?  Western burger with cheddar, bacon and lettuce and tomato top notch, though promised onion ring seemed to have missed my plate.  Combo of regular and sweet potato fries well worth $3.  Salads generous and flavorful.  Root Beer is of note."}
{"text":"Great place in Scottsdale to grab a bite to eat.  We took the whole family (me, wife and three boys).  John (Gio), treated us like we were family.  Good burgers and the kids loved their meals as well (chicken tenders, corn dog and cheeseburgers).  The game was on the TV's and the atmosphere was great.   Thanks John, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I don't get burgers so can't comment on them, but they have some great salads and the turkey burgers are really good too. I love their sweet potato fries. I have always had really good service. It's nice to be able to sit outside with a glass of wine. I don't think you can go wrong here for a nice casual dinner."}
{"text":"Just like a lot of the other reviewers have experienced.  Slow service and overcooked food.

We went there because it was closer to home and wanted to get a quick meal.  I ordered my burger medium rare and although it was still pink it was somehow also dry.  The sweet potato fries were way overcooked and my wife's burger cooked to medium was really dry.  Restaurant was half full and the food took 30 mins after ordering.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"never imagined eating a bad burger in Scottsdale. But life is full of surprises and today for lunch, in the company of my lovely wife, Lush Burger was a total disappointment.
I ordered the Lush burger classic and my wife ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich. We included a side of sweet potato fries.
From the beginning, things did not go well. My burger arrived cold and dry so it was sent back .
Meanwhile, we treated ourselves to the buffalo sandwich. The taste was good, a little sweet for my taste, but the one thing my wife and I did not like, was the bread.( The sweet potato fries were greasy but had good taste.
She thought it was a sweet potato roll, cold, and overly filling. After a close examination of the menu, we found it was not a potato roll but a French brioche bun. Either way, we did not approve of it.
When my burger finally came back, I noticed the brioche was cold and hurried to try my burger before it turned cold again. The patty was dry and had no flavor. The  combination  of meat and sweet cold brioche did not sit well with my taste buds
 A nicely decorated place, great ambiance, beautiful mountain views, good service..... all of it in great abundance. What was lacking ; content.
Fast, casual perfection?  Not in a lush time."}
{"text":"Okay, we finally got it. A family friendly, upscale restaurant in DC Ranch that we can walk to! Lush Burger is a fast, casual, yet very upscale new burger concept in DC Ranch. We tried it tonight- went early since they are slammed (shows the demand for affordable, family dining.). You walk into a LUSH (yes, lush, very plush) red and stainless restaurant that is whimsical and very comfortable at the same time. You walk up, order your food and they deliver it to your table. With an extensive menu at affordable price points, we were intrigued. Hubby and I selected lushburger classics with various accoutrements. I had mine \"skinny style\" with no bun and butter lettuce instead. Our 12 year old ordered the kids 2 baby lushburgers and he loved the veggie option instead of fries. Big Daddy had to try both the truffle fries (divine) and onion rings (crispy and delicious, NO GREASE!) The wine and beer offerings were affordable and fun. You can reorder at your table and don't have to get back in line (which gets fairly long). Our son's chocolate shake was frozen heaven and he licked it all out! The Harris Ranch burgers were moist and cooked perfectly. They were nice sized (important to hubby) and juicy. Next time, he will go for the wings. There is a nice variety of salads, ahi tuna burgers and turkey burgers but we wanted to start with the basics for the first visit. People were having fun and the outside patio was a happening hot spot for sure. Children were more than welcome and the owners were present and meeting guests. They were looking for feedback (important on only a few days open) and were creating a fun vibe. We will definitely be back. Lots of fun and we walked off dinner on the 20 minute walk home! Laurie, Rodney and Maximillian Malone"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the service, food, and atmosphere are perfect.  The patio is peaceful and perfect during the winter months of AZ and the food is delicious.  You will not find better quality burgers for the price in Scottsdale!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge burger fan and, frankly, Lush Burger was a enormous dissappointment.  

My friend and I ordered the classic burger with the 50/50 combo of sweet potato and regular fries.  

As for the burger... To start, the bun was hard, cold, and dry.  The meat was also dry, flavorless, overcooked, and significantly under-seasoned.   I had to salt my burger at the table and coat it with ketchup to make up for the dryness and lack of flavor.  Also, the meat was extremely dense and tough, as if it had been over-worked when shaped into a patty.   

As for the fries, they were cold, soggy, and also underseasoned.  I am not sure they were salted at all before showing up at our table.  

Overall, the only thing this place has going for it is a trendy decore.  If you want a great, beefy burger, try The Grind in Phoenix, or you can also try the \"ground to order\" sirloin burger at La Grande Orange.  Heck... just go to your local In and Out.  Any of these options are far superior to the bland mediocre fare at Lush."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Great, convenient location. What's better than a good burger?
Another restaurant making it. If the burger I had was any more overcooked and dried out the NHL would own it. Bottom of bun was mush. Drinks were nasty. Server said 'Yah, other people
have said so too. So drink something different'. A real problem solver! The place did not feel clean. The attitude of the entire staff felt like they just didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"Bad service and sub par portions with a big price tag. 

We were sat right away and ordered but had to wait 45 min for a burnt turkey burger and a burger with a chunk of bone in it. 

What a terrible experience. Also the nerve to charge 2-3 dollars for about 15 fries is deplorable. The burger I ordered was advertised with grilled onions and there was a very small amount. It was a mere dash. 

As I stated earlier I chomped down and hurt my tooth on a chunk of bone. 

Save your time, patience, and wallet by steering clear."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots when I'm in town. I've not tried a lot of the menu bc I love the ahi tuna burger so much that I get it every time.  Highly recommend- so good.

Service is quick and generally helpful.  Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Great shakes, great burgers and fries. Good for groups and kids. But food takes very long time and lots of flies."}
{"text":"Awful!!! Service incredibly poor. The waiter didn't bother to inform me the goat cheese for my burger was unavailable until the food came out, and no opportunity to adjust my order. My husband's soda never arrived...and after the goat cheese incident he never bothered to stop by the table to check on us, except to drop off the check (which had the charge for the soda on it). My husband had to go up to the bar to correct the bill and pay, because the waiter didn't come back to the table. The burgers were mediocre at best. Brioche bun, um no...way to dense. They even used the \"brioche\" bun to make my sons grilled cheese...let's just say it was all bread. Also, my wine was hot, not even room temp, hot! Just a really awful experience."}
{"text":"Lush burger is a five star rating every time.  Their burgers are second to none!   Service is top notch, bar was exceptional for such a small venue. The food is not cheap but if you want a cheap burger and bad iced tea try a fast food place down the street."}
{"text":"The new menu is great! Especially loved the flat bread selection. Service was great and friendly. Thanks for having us"}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible service...  We really wanted to like this place.  Close to home, great decor, love burgers.  However, they just can't get it together - nor do they seem to care.

On our last (and final) visit, the guy at the cashier was the loudest person.  It was ridiculous.  When they brought out our sweet potato fries - they were black, completely burned.  Anyone taking them out of the fryer should have noticed.  They dump the food off and never come back to even see how anything is.

Overall decent burger - but not worth the fight to get drink refills, properly cooked food and any type of food."}
{"text":"Out of the three burgers & sandwiches ordered at our table, I'd be least likely to recommend the \"classic\". The brioche buns these burgers are served on are WAY too sweet. The buns overpower the burger, and if you get the classic, there's nothing added to the meat to give it any extra flavor. The patties were too small compared to the brioche bun - there was a good half inch of bread sticking over all sides of the burger. There weren't any complaints about the \"infusion\" or the grilled chicken wing sandwich from the two that ordered them, so maybe try these out if you visit. Don't pay the $8 for the classic though. Total waste of money."}
{"text":"The burger was fantastic and the sweet potato overload fries as well as the truffle fries were a glutton's dream..... but the sevice was decent at best. I think the girl might have been new though so I'll cut them some slack! Reasonably priced, good tasting food will win me over almost anytime."}
{"text":"UPDATE!!!!!! 02/13/11

Ok so my last review was 8/10 and after a very disappointing visit, I did receive an email from a woman that claimed to be the new manager and asked to give them another chance. (Let me preface this with usually you will get some kind of offer to bring you back but I received nothing.) So my son asked about Lush and we were hungry for burgers so I decided to give them another try. Went in and not busy at all so I figured probably a good time to come in. (It was about 2pm today). Greeted immediately and we sat down at a booth near the bar area. Unlike last time we were given menus instead of placing an order at the front first. We were told that _____ was going to serve us. But like last time the service was lack luster.... waited and waited for anyone to say anything to us. No way they could be busy because counting us there were only 4 other groups of people there. Finally ______ did come and he looked a little confused and muttered something like I will be right back. After a few minutes he did come back and asked what we wanted to drink, I told him we were actually ready to order if he had the time.... he said sure... so we started to order but then had to repeat the first order because he didn't write it down so after waiting for him to get his pen and paper out he took our order. We ordered the kids small burgers and a plain regular burger, fries and drinks. I asked if they had sweet tea and they don't so I ordered the passion tea. I think it would be obvious to bring some sugar but nope no sugar so after waiting for him to come back, I walked up to the bar area and grabbed my own sugar. Food did come but it did seem to take a little bit but the burgers were good and the fries being a little over cooked and crispy were perfect... (That's the way I like my fries).... The burger seemed small especially for the cost. It was good but really nothing spectacular and nothing to go crazy over. Now comes the bill, so for 2 regular burgers, kids small burger, 3 fries, water, iced tea, and sprite the bill came out to about $50...... I guess I really don't get the high prices for the burgers... I could go to another place and get a burger just as good that come with fries for the cost of just the burger here and there you get free refills on fries.... So not really sold on why I paid that much for Lush burger when really it wasn't worth it. So needless to say I probably won't go again and hey if you want to overspend on burgers and fries then go for it. But if you want to get more for your money and probably better service then there are other places that you can go. Sorry but I just don't buy it....."}
{"text":"love this place! I have been coming here for years and it's either spot on or pretty mediocre. tonight was one of the better nights! I had a delicious burger and shake and had an amazing server! he was so personable and was definitely the best server I have had so far in my years here. I ordered a kids strawberry shake and he gave me the full size no charge! he also got us out of there quickly as my dad was in a huge rush. the fries were delicious but I would skip the chips and upgrade to the fries. 

update: went here again and had an amazing meal. the bella burger is to die for if you like balsamic and mushrooms! also the cookie skillet was so so good as always but I recommend asking for only one scoop of ice cream unless you love ice cream"}
{"text":"With the name Lush Burger I expected just that a lush burger. We arrived on a Monday @ 5:30 pm and there were only 2 other tables of people there eating. First let me say the 2 stars are for the outside patio and kids eating free on Mondays. I had the turkey cob burger 'skinny style' (supposed to be wrapped in lettuce). The burger arrived with a gigantic lettuce leaf on top and bottom stuck in with a toothpick. The lettuce was not even close to being wrapped on the burger so I could pick it up and eat it. The turkey was overcooked and dry. The sweet potato fries where good but just the standard frozen ones that you get everywhere. My husband said his med rare burger was also overcooked. Overall our service wasn't good, we barely saw our server and had to ask another server to get our server so we could order more drinks. We knew going in this was a pricey place and we don't mind that if the food is exceptional... We won't be back as there are far too many other gourmet burger places in the area."}
{"text":"This place has an AWESOME happy hour! 4 - 7 $3.00 beers. In tall, chilled, 16 oz glasses! Not like those other places that announce happy hour and actually charge $2.00 for 8 oz beer glass! 

They also serve $.50 wings and $1.50 sliders during happy hour! What else could you ask for, for a quick \"me\" time after work?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we went there last night to try it. A nice looking place from the outside and in but it ends there. The whole experience was a total waste of time and money. It would have been better to just drive by the place, roll down the car window, and throw 40 bucks out the window than give it to these space cadets. No-clue servers, cooks arguing in the kitchen, people angry about no dessert they ordered after their meal, no water at the table, boisterous guy at the cash register upselling the food in an annoying voice, and waiters and waitresses LOST just trying to figure out how to deliver a water glass to people outside. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. Food was awful. Raw hamburger meat on a medium ordered angus beef burger, absolutely tasteless....the whole thing...no flavor whatsoever....falling apart between a tiny bun...as dry as you can imagine a hamburger patty to be, even raw (?) I didn't even know that was possible, but they did it! The \"truffle\" fries were completely tasteless. No spoon brought with my milkshake which was way too thick to even use a straw with. And, server training the whole time in a loud voice right next to us that became really annoying after about two minutes of that. I wonder if the owner of this place has ever actually BEEN in his restaurant and seen what's going on in there. I really do. You couldn't drag me back screaming.
If there was a \"no star\" rating, I would be happy to give it. And they would deserve it."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I don't know if it was the manager or owner, however he came over and asked how the food was. Really nice guy. Going a little out of the way for this place instead of listening to the grumpy owner at indulge burger."}
{"text":"I have driven by lush several times but never thought to stop. I had no idea I was missing out. Took the family for some burgers tonight... Definitely will be returning. Burgers were great and service was incredible."}
{"text":"Expensive - burger is bland, no flavor.  Decor and patio are nice and fit for the area.  Service was good.  Food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"I walked into Lush for lunch the other day to  the amazing decor and a very friendly guy taking our order. I had learned that you have to order at the counter then you get a number and your food is brought out to you. 

I was going back and forth between one of the good looking salads or the veggie burger. Our drinks were brought out right away by another friendly staffer who was willing to help me with the high chair I was trying to set up for my baby.  Our food came out shortly after. I have to say if you are searching for a fresh homemade veggie burger than this is the place for you.  Most of the burger joints around have the frozen kind of veggie burger.  I had the in and out veggie burger which used to veggie patties instead of a bun with some arugula, avocado, and red peppers inside and I added Swiss cheese.  I love that there are choices for everyone..if you want healthy they have healthy...if you want a burger and fries they have that too.  As we were eating, our drinks were constantly being refilled and refreshed.  

I can't wait to go back and try the Kobe burger and fries!  If I am really tempted the desserts and shakes look great.  As of now, they have their beer and wine license, but the full liqueur license is coming soon..."}
{"text":"Upscale burger place in north Scottsdale. Very nice looking place with a great patio. The sweet potato fries are quite good. Nothing special about the burgers.  I have also had their buffalo chicken sandwich and thought it was again average."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here a few times.  This place happens to be close to the office and a decent place to do a little people watching of the uppity Scottsdale folks.  

 My first visit I got a really good meatloaf sandwich that was on special.  there was a generous portion and it tasted real good.  I got the sweet potato fries to complement it and was satisfied.

My friend I was dining with got the Kobe burger.  His burger was not cooked correctly and tasted lackluster.  Needless to say he was disappointed with the close to $20 bucks spent for a mediocre burger.

I had no plans of returning but.... I tend to give second and third chances.

After seeing a lunch special coupon for $10 I felt I would give it a try. I got the special (the special is a burger fries and drink)  it was cooked just right med rare nice and bloody and was a great meal and value in my opinion.   

I returned for a third meal and was equally impressed with the burger and experience.   I wasn't that impressed with the truffle fries.  i will stick with sweet potato next time I dine here."}
{"text":"It is decorated very nicely. Everyone is very nice. The food is good, but needs some work. .. They need to work out the kinks in the system. Both the order system which requires standing in a line like at Mc Donalds only there is a number system. The servers have to cut through the line to serve people and have to find your number. Maybe work it like Kashmans? They have to change where the line stands at least.
The kitchen had trouble getting our order out together and at once. The server was very sorry about our order mix up. However never saw a manager and were charged fulll price when we didnt ge tth ecorrect food. The server asked if the manager took the wrong food off our bill. Advised her Manager didnt. so we paid 71.oo for lunch that two of us got the wrong food. It was cute and nice outside, dont know if ill spen 71.00 again. Might go back but dont know. They need to get it organized.it.      GREAT SERVERS VERY NICE AND POLITE! Have done a great job on that end."}
{"text":"We have gone to Lush Burger several times, enticed by the \"$5.99\" for any burger, salad or pizza coupons we get monthly for being in their loyalty club. Unfortunately, cheap is what you get and Lushburger seems to be getting cheaper and cheaper with their ingrediennts and qualtiy of service. We have had problems with them overcharging several times and when we question the charges, we get double talk and irrational explanations. They play some sort of trick math to boost the bill. Apparently they don't really mean $5.99 for a burger, they just haven't gotten around to fixing the coupons to accurately reflect what the real deal is. Hmm. How many months does that take? Also, dishonest is their sneaky upcharging. They provide overcooked tasteless \"homemade\" chips with the burgers, but always ask if you are okay with them or would you rather substitue french fries. Sounds good? We did once and got a surprise stiff upcharge on our bill for choosing french fries instead of chips. Our last visit, 5/2 and I mean our LAST visit got an upcharge on one of the burgers because we asked to leave the sauce off the burger. Hmmm.  We have noticed the sauces on the burgers seem to have gotten more and more watered down over time. Last nights Western burger featured a tasteless onion ring and watery tasteless barbecue sauce. I've had much tastier Westerns at Burger King. And for the third time, they overcharged us on our bill and reluctantly made only a partial adjustment.
So, we've had enough of their great coupons for cheap meals out. No more poor service, indifferent attitude about upcharges, blah ingredients, and overcharges.
NO MORE!"}
{"text":"Shotty service. You sit around with empty drinks a little too much. Pretzel bread is terrible, I really recommend you stay away from that. I had the Burger with green Chillies and I must say it was good. The sweet potato fries are blah ( buy better at the super market in the frozen section ). Over all not impressed. I did enjoy the Oreo Shake though. Maybe Ill go back for that."}
{"text":"We really want to like this place as we live close by, but after several poor experiences, we cannot endorse Lush Burger

Food ok, but service and attitude of staff unprofessional.

Over 30 minutes to get a simple cheeseburger and the order was incorrect. No apology from waiter, did not return to deliver check. Had to ask busboy for check.

Not good value for price."}
{"text":"Stopped in here hoping they would have an organic beef burger. They did not. I ordered the regular burger which was over cooked and took forever. The servers were more interested in socializing and talking to reps than customer service. The fresh chips were hard as a rock and must have been left over from the day before. As I was about to take my third bite of burger a large cockroach. Appeared in the dining room. I got up and immediately left, never to return again."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have been here a total of 4 times. The first time was a little over a year ago and it was some of the best food I have ever had. However, a few months later it was not anywhere as good and the service was average. Since then I gave it two more chances, the service has been fine and welcoming but the food has gotten worse and worse. This last time was the final time I will ever eat here. It was bad enough that I felt ripped off when I left and the recent reviews show I am not the only one that feels this way."}
{"text":"H-ORRIBLE! 
Zero stars if I could.
Don't come here cuz I won't again, burger took over 20-30 min and it came out with cold overdone fries likely waiting under a dry heat lamp. Burger had potential but the brioche bun wasn't even toasted and the patty overcooked as well and was bland! Seriously it's a friggen $9 burger we're paying!
#MAJORFAIL"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I ordered a salad,  and it was big enough for 3 people! not all lettuce either...yummy! my daughter had a burger and she said it \"was the best she's ever had\"
The house chips are delis! ! The service was great, and it's really cute inside..there is a nice patio area also..the prices are decent, you get your $$$ worth
Check out LUSH BURGER! It's good stuff!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Lush Burger to celebrate my bosses birthday (he loves burgers).  Sat outside on a beautiful sunny AZ day, the patio is awesome!  Only about 2 tables of guests on the patio.   

After 10-15 minutes, a nice young man asked us if we wanted drinks.  Another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived.  FINALLY we were asked if we would like to order.  THIRTY minutes before our food arrived.  Burgers were OK but nothing spectacular.  We had to hunt our server down to get our check.  Dirty plates were not picked up when we finished our burgers.

My suggestion is to try and accomodate week-day lunch guest quickly.  We all needed to get back to work!"}
{"text":"Good chicken sandwich and burgers.......but I will never wait an hour for lunch again. I would understand if the place was packed, but four tables were seated when we arrived. Again, good food but expect a long wait."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet with my family on the weekend. The atmosphere is posh, yet kid friendly.  The food is served hot and fresh by the chef.

 My only complaint is that most of the waitresses are a little lacking in customer service skills and what are appropriate remarks or comments at the table.

 On our last visit the waitress  brought the check to the table when the meal was first  delivered and informed me she would pick it up when I was ready. We had not even started our lunch yet,  and planned to order a desert. 

After we were finished with our lunch I was looking over the bill in order to calculate the tip, and the waitress came over and told me she saw me staring at the bill and wanted me to  know she added the cost of a  desert after this bill was given to me.  

 I can overlook this, but think my tip should be shared with the chef since he is the one making the best impression, in fact, I regret leaving any tip.  It might be a good idea to re-train the waitresses on customer service skills."}
{"text":"Ok, I was close to Heaven eating a the Dec 2017 Special called 'The Jack', all I have to say is WOOOOOW!! This Beast has real Hatch Green Chile, cheese(a ton of it), Anaheim peppers, more Chihuahua Cheese and hear this, all in between fresh made Sopapilla and more.  If you are from New Mexico, if you will know what a Sopapilla is, if not, you better find out!  Now, the Service was great, our Server Nick took great care of me, my wife and my Children, so friendly and attentive, we were well taken care of and found it a must to give him cudo's for a Great Job!  Phil Y., not sure what happened but I would give it another try...I will be so back...

Sr Plata's Granddaughter:

I tried for the first time the Beef Sliders. The buns tasted homemade and fresh, they complemented the burger very well. A taste of heaven!! There was no cheese or condiments but it was bliss! Sr Plata asks'\"What all was on the burger?\" and I replied, \"Just meat and the bun, and that was all that was needed.\""}
{"text":"My first experience started out memorable, but my overalll experience was  very miserable!
The place was really cool looking, I was excited to experience the food.  Just moved from Seattle in late March.

Here's how it went for my on that Friday March 28th between noon and 1 PM.

1. My daughter was getting her hair done at Hydra Spa, across from Lush Burger.
She asked me to go get her a milkshake.  The male server was fast and friendly.  I told him I would be right back for my first ever lunch at the bar, after I delivered the shake to my daughter across the way at the salon.  I told him I would be right back in a few minutes, and I was.
He regreeted me surprisingly, and I expressed \" I told you I would be right back.\"
I was one of only two customers at the bar.
He didn't even give me a menu and never came back.
I could see all the servers were busy, so I waited patiently.
After several minutes, I fully expected he or some other server would acknowledge me and say, \"we'll get with you ASAP.\"
Nothing happened.  No server or manager even looked my way, and I was in the middle of the bar, with only one other customer to my far left.
Here is we're what I hoped would be a memorable \"First\" experience, became a Very Miserable\" experience.
Two other customers sat at the bar, one two stools to my right and one two stools to my left.
Within a few minutes, both were given a menu and had their orders taken and then quickly their food served.
All along, I get not one look.
When they got their food served, I was furious!!!
I asked a male server to please get the manager for me.
The manager listened and apologized and asked for my order.
I got my order and it was not what I ordered.
She again apologized.
She ended up comping my meal, even though I never asked her to.
I could not be more disappointed and will not go back, and want everyone I know and those smart enough to pay attention to real customer reviews, don't be fooled by a cool looking place.  Until ownership hires people who truly buy into being \"servers all the time to every patron\", this place is going nowhere fast.
I have one word, followed by two words.
Unbelievable!!!
Patrons beware!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Lemonade tastes like Country Time powder mix, Cesear salad dressing was suspiciously similar to Kraft, Buffalo chips sounded creative but were basic and plain and the burgers were not Lush, they were over-cooked, bland and served with only ketchup which we had to ask for 3 times despite being one of only a handful of customers there."}
{"text":"Had a great burger cooked right. The burger came  medium rare as requested. The western burger had cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce and an onion ring. Yum. Their home made chips are very tasty. It would have been absolutely perfect but too much bun/bread. I noticed many sandwiches there have a huge bun bottom. Not certain if they want to create an illusion of a huge sandwich but really not necessaty. Sandwiches are nicely proportioned.
I would return"}
{"text":"Walked into the place expecting with my lawyer a 65 year old woman of class.  We were dressed in professional business attire.  The greeter does not greet and tells us to find our own table when all the tables were filled.  Finally we got a table the server barely said hello, I mean Mcdonalds next greets you with a bigger smile for 99 cents.  In addition to that the burger came they were Ok but served luke warm and seemed like they had been sitting around.  This is for a 14 dollar burger.  I fairness I did return to this place by myself to grab a bite and had virtually the same repeat experience.  No hospitality, a bunch of grown men upset that they are stuck serving burgers well guess what that is not the customer fault LOL.  Anyway again COLD burgers and the cold shoulder from the staff.  You may be happier going to MCdonalds is all I have to say."}
{"text":"Newish place, interesting concept: Fast(ish) food without the yuck factor, and considerably more hip.

Similar to a Pei-Wei or Chipotle style setup, patrons queue up in front of the register, and big bright menu screens overhead help you decide what tasty treat to order. A number on your table steers servers in the right direction when your order is up. Service was friendly, if somewhat slow, but it was one of the first weeks the place was open.

My man sent me to secure a patio table on a busy weekend night while he stood in line to order, and I told him to \"surprise me\" with his dinner choices. He returned with a grin, and told me that he ordered us a Cinnamon shake, which was really quite impressive, and disappeared quickly between our two straws. 

I ate a sort of inside-out veggie burger, where the veggie burger patties (pretty flavorful I might add) surrounded a spinach salad. The veggie burgers were good, but the salad was far overdressed, and the mustard-flavored dressing started out great, but quickly overwhelmed the rest of the dish. 

I can't remember what my fiance ate, maybe because it disappeared so quickly. The sweet potato fries were zesty and warm, and we ate them with gusto.

Overall, I haven't had the chance to go back, but I think that a couple slight preparation tweaks will improve the status of the menu from Lush Burger to Lust Burger. Best of luck to this new establishment!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. We work right down the street on Princess. It was great. Burger was cooked just as I asked and was out to our table in about 15 minutes. I remember telling my wife, the patty is still hot. That is how freshly cooked it came to out table. The house made potato chips were great too, thick cut and fried crispy. Messy burger but very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I walked into the upscale burger joint and was impressed at the large layout, burger choices, televisions, and draught beer selection. However, the first burger I got was so undercooked, it was red on the outside. So, I showed the waiter and his eyes opened wide and said, 'wow, that is very rare, let's redo that.' The next burger I got was burnt on the outside and red on the inside. I didn't make a big stink about it, I just paid the bill and walked out with no plan to ever return."}
{"text":"Love this place! First time customer, beautiful bar and great hamburgers. Yelp rating does this place an injustice, it is a hidden gem. We had no idea when we happened upon this place. Great atmosphere and an outstanding bartender."}
{"text":"Lush Burger is close to my work so I go there from time to time.  When I go I get the Ahi Tuna Burger and fries.  They Have Lush fries, Sweet Potato and Truffle fries which all very good.  That and a tea or beer and I and set!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many many times. This was my last! They have been under new ownership for some time now,long enough to get any kinks out. The GM has probably never worked in restaurant business before. The web site says happy hour all day Sunday. The  GM says oh we dont do that anymore. Ok. Then I say I have a AAA membership and they are listed as a place that takes 20% off regular priced food. GM says wow you sure are all about the internet, we don't do that anymore either. What??? He says he has a 15% off card he can apply to my order. Thanks. 
Now the kids meals are $7.50!!! That's a lot. My veggie burger was chilly inside but I didn't complain. It took long enough to get out the first time. Food was decent at best. Not worth what we paid. 
Unfortunately we will not be back. It's a shame too, it used to be a staple in our restaurant choices."}
{"text":"We've had takeout twice from Lush Burger and thought it was pretty decent.  Both times I had the lush burger classic with gorgonzola and truffle fries.  Husband tried the lush burger classic with cheddar and the western burger.

My burgers were cooked as ordered, on a nice brioche bun with butter lettuce, red onion, tomato and their sauce.  I wish they had something sharper in a blue than the gorgonzola (a maytag blue maybe), it's too delicate and the flavor is lost.  I loved the truffle fries, they had some grated parmesan on them but were still crisp (but why do so many restaurants in AZ sell coated french fries?????).

My husband loved his western burger.

Very pleased with this place, I wouldn't get a burger here every time but it's a great close spot with plenty of options."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but have been disappointed the last several times there. The service is the main problem. Their people scurry around everywhere, but we waited 15 minutes to get a drink last night. That's just way too long.

The food is good - their infused burgers are their namesake and the menu is ample. My wife & I love the Ahi Tuna Salad. There's lots of TVs to watch the game(s), a great patio, a hosted gametruck for the kids on Sundays and a liberal happy hour... lots of good stuff. I really WANT to love this place, but the service has been poor on our last 4-5 stops here."}
{"text":"There wasn't much right....service wasn't good, chips were thick and tasteless, we asked for well done fries which came cold and soggy, floor was dirty, we had to go find our own napkins and silverware after the food arrived, we asked for ranch dressing to come with the food...then had to ask again, drinks didn't get refilled, we asked for the lettuce, tomato, etc. on the side....guess, what? That didn't happen either.  The experience was really bad, especially considering the price we had to pay.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Lousy service. Staff ignores customers and socializes among themselves. Food is slow and meh. No sign of a manager anywhere onsite. Better burgers elsewhere. Main problem here is lack of leadership and no management."}
{"text":"The food was alright. For some reason, they were out of pizza? How. The server was very kind. The chips that come with the burger were very hard and unflavorful. I might not be coming back. Also, $2 for fries?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, place was busy. Staff were attentive, fast and friendly. Had a hummus and ahi salad, guest had a chicken sand. Service prompt, food tasty,great job on refills

Decor nice- will visit again"}
{"text":"Service is really lacking here. We had a group of 15, which I understand is large, but 2 of us waited an hour and then received their checks before even receiving their food. This is clearly not acceptable."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not worth it!!!  I could have gone to in and out and had a better burger for 1/3 of the price. The guy who came around to the table to ask how everything was in flip flops, so unappetizing. The only thing good was the girls up at the front who took my order, they were friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and manager Giovanni was rude and unprofessional.
The food was mediocre at best- the pizza looked/tasted like a frozen store bought pie that wasn't cooked properly. The burger was flavorless.
Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Lush Burger five times.  Always had a burger and have never had a bad meal.  Love the Bella Angus Burger. Great flavor and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very good. Ordered takeout for 5 people tonight. 4 burgers, chicken tenders, a bunch of sides (onion rings, mozzarella triangles, etc)... all of it was yummy. The caesar salad was just decent. Could use some improvement there. Everything else was great. The girls at the counter were very nice and helpful. The food was hot and didn't take too long to prepare. Everyone's order was correct. It wasn't life changing, but it was really good. We will order from here again."}
{"text":"Great hip spot to throw back some cold local beers with the boys. With the weather getting better, take advantage of the cool patio. 
I normally get the turkey burger and love it.
Sweet potato fries are crispy hot succulent and overall bomb.com! 
I'm not married but if I was this would be a great local spot to get away from the wife and watch the game"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst burger I've ever had. My turkey burger was a frozen patty, fries were overly crispy, old and hard, pizzas were nothing special. Service was even horrible, the waitress definitely seemed like she had other plans that night that she was more concerned with than waiting on her tables. 

Overall disappointment, hopefully this place goes out and an actual restaurant will replace it."}
{"text":"I was really craving a good veggie burger and Lush is close to work, so I decided to give it a try. We were surprised by the tacky interior when we first got to Lush Burger. Cow hide seats with red embellishments? Yikes...  The place was EMPTY on Friday at noon -- really strange for being in the North Scottsdale business neighborhood.

My boyfriend got the classic Lush burger. He said it was very mediocre. He probably wouldn't come again as he wasn't impressed. 

 I got the 'inside out veggie burger' - (it's important to emphasize that it was not exactly a veggie burger.. it was more like super thin pan-fried quinoa sheets (2 of them) -- in place of the bun to hold in all the balsamic arugula... very strange). The balsamic reduction completely overpowered the taste. It said it had zucchini and squash in the 'burger' but I saw no such thing -- only the crispy quinoa sheets. 

There was a tiny slice of avocado and some red peppers in the midst of the arugula...  I wish they had an option to NOT get chips, and opt for a salad instead -- as I am obviously opting for their 'healthier' lunch option. 

If you are looking for a new vegetarian option, this is not it. I expected a robust veggie burger patty with quinoa and vegetables ... not what I got at all. 

As everyone has already  mentioned.. fries are $3 extra, so if you opt for fries, it'd be an $11 lunch meal -- it wasn't even worth it for $8. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place in the neighborhood! 

The food is classic amazing and yummy. My favourite is the Michele's bbq chicken pizza. But all their food is good especially with new management.
Staff and management is very friendly. This is a place Feel comfortable coming alone knowing the staff is friendly so I know I have good company around me.

Their shakes are amazing too. Highly recommends for the family and kids"}
{"text":"Wow were we displeased!! First off, let me start by saying my fiance and I have both been servers and we completely understand the job and the frustrations with it, however, our service was beyond bad. Our server (I'll withhold her name out of respect) was completely unfriendly, didn't greet us or even make eye contact. We watched her multiple times during dinner flirting with other patrons, yet everytime she came around to us...which wasn't often, she didn't even give us the time of day. We weren't needy, rude, matter of fact, we were so kind and even stacked our plates to help them out. End of meal she tossed our check on the table and said have a goodnight with no eye contact, while still walking!! Wow. We decided to tip 30% understanding that she needs to make a living too, but be weary. That place needs training on how to treat and tend to paying customers."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! My burger alone was $13 then the server asked me what side I wanted with it, I asked what my options were and she read them off, fries, chips, mixed veggie sticks or salad. I choose salad, which I just got plain (no garnish, literally just lettuce and balamic) my husband choose plain carrots. when we got out bill we had a $6 up charge for choosing those sides. the server NEVER said anything and when we asked if they would reconsider this as the menu never said it was an ADDITIONAL $3, one would assume it was easy to substitute the server got an attitude with us and said she would talk to her manager. she came back several minutes later and said \"my manager said it's clearly on the menu so we won't do anything..sorry\" in a condensing tone. needless to say we will not be back, terrible customer service all over $6."}
{"text":"Quick service every time I go, BEST turkey sliders! Must ask for extra sauce. I have never tried anything else there but if you like turkey burgers than this trio is a must!"}
{"text":"Update to previous review... New ownership. New menu.  Big jump in prices.  $3.75 for an iced tea?? Wow.  While the previous owner had really great meat this new vendor is just ok.  I won't go back or recommend it.  It's still a cute place in a great location but the new menu and prices aren't great."}
{"text":"I got the seared ahi salad and hubby got the Ahi burger with homemade chips. They both tasted fresh. I had a buy one get one free coupon so maybe I'm was biased. Our server was polite and efficient. The inside was crowded so we sat outside. The seats were comfortable and we weren't ignored even though there were only a few customers out there. I signed up for email specials and got another bogo free and hubby and I went again. We equally liked our food. He got a turkey burger this time and said it was equally as good as the ahi tuna."}
{"text":"I went there with my wife and the place has a nice vibe.  We were greeted immediately when we walked in and seated.  The staff is very cordial.  We ordered the fries with truffle oil, and they were amazing.  Their burgers are ok. My wife thought the meat was dry and was missing seasoning or salt.  I ordered my burger medium.  I had the wings, and he wasn't too impressed.  For the same price, I think indulge burger is a better spot."}
{"text":"Came in during a work trip & seemed at first a little quiet. Once we got in we saw how much fun it was. Had Holly as our server. Very pleasant & upbeat. She made the experience at first amazing till we tried the food. The maholo chicken sando was on point the chicken with teriyaki pineapple and Swiss was top notch. Would def go back & recommend to all my friends and family. For work we visit Scottsdale often and is always hard to find good food. Thank you lush for serving good food & beverages! Would recommend going to all friends & family."}
{"text":"I love this joint. I'm here a couple times per week. The burgers are great and the service is just right. The owners are always on sight and take care of customers."}
{"text":"Three times they bugged me for my check. 
Before I finished eating. 
They came for my plate twice. Before I was finished eating. 
Not very nice at all. 
The food was good."}
{"text":"Service, food and atmosphere are wonderful!!! Love this place!!  Been here for special events as well as just \"lunch with the girls\" and EVERY time they are so attentive! My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I got an email rant from the owner that was mention here already. it was off the rails, basically calling his customer, cheap and to stupid to realize he was doing a great job. I was speechless.

I hadn't been to Lush in 2 years, well before he bought it. I was just tired of the menu and spotty service, I had no hard feelings. Odds were given time i would have dropped back in there. However, after his smug, we are smarted than you email (which I guess he sent to his entire blast email list) I had to log onto YELP and post my response and he. 

Well, here goes.

Me: 

I have not been to Lush in nearly 2 yrs, well before you bought it. The service was mediocre on their best day and I just grew tired of it and the menu. I had no hard feelings, there are other healthier alternatives in the area and I just moved on.

Honestly, I hadn't thought of Lush in forever, However, after this email, I'm just shocked, and would never go back.

Never in a million years would I imagine a business owner sending an email out like this. You must be an idiot. And, business must be horrific to resort to striking out and responding to survey results in this fashion.

I have owned business, run business and currently serve business owners in a variety of capacities. You, sir, have taken your spot in the hall of fame. I'll give you free advice I usually charge for. Sell now and move on.

You have made a fool of yourself to the millions of people on this email list, like me. Like I said, I hadn't been there in years. I had forgotten about Lush but maybe, just maybe I would have dropped in and started going back. well now, never, 

I'll go to McDonald's as you so kindly suggested in a smug, we don't need you, we know better east coast way.

Good Luck 

Him:

Love it! Thx Jack.  You are the epitome of what the overwhelmingly positive respondents to my email call the 'snotsdale' resident.  
Enjoy McDonalds.  Probably priced right for you and over the level of quality you are expecting and certainly priced right no doubt.

Best regards 

Jay

If you want to give a guy like this your business, good luck"}
{"text":"Food was above average, crab cake sandwich was a nice change of pace.  the special sauce needed a bit more heat.  Marinara for cheese sticks was great nice and chunky. Service was slow, the crazy BALL LIGHTS above the bar prevents any one from watching Sports if they are sitting inside.  Restrooms a disaster, full trash cans, and a roll of hand towels sitting on the sink...which means half the roll was wet due to the water on the sink.
Flies are everywhere against the windows.  Maybe some type of fan system at the entrances to the flying insects from entering....
Would have graded better but the service was slow slow slow....even the bill when I asked for it twice....slow slow slow...Good Luck tough area with McDonalds next door....No bottle beer..."}
{"text":"I take my staff there a couple times a year for company lunches. So many gourmet burger options to choose from but the clear favorite was the Cure burger (formally the Hangover burger). But on this last trip we noticed a new arrival, The Cuban burger, what what??? Ya, Cuban burger.  Of course this peaked all our curiosity. It looked spectacular in the picture but the question was, \"Would it look as good in person?\" You know how it is, you see a commercials on TV or a pic of the food and when it comes out you're all \"That's not what I ordered!\" But in this case it's even more beautiful in person than in the pic. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"What's a Cuban burger?\" Well if you like Cubans and you like gourmet burgers you will love the Cuban burger. All the trappings of a Cuban, pork and ham and pickles and mustard with a premium grade burger to top it off. Absolutely delicious! Huge generous portions. I could only eat half at lunch but the could news was I ate the other half for dinner. Already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Man... this place is great!  I did the Infusion Burger... Atmosphere is upscale without making you feel like dressing up!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I tried out the new Yelp Eat24 food delivery service. We were pleased to see restaurants available beyond the offerings of other food delivery sites. Unfortunately they forgot the main ingredient of a western burger which is the BBQ sauce. For a $14 burger served with dry chips, I expected so much better. Welp first and last time using Yelp's Eat24. I recommend they run some QA with the restaurants they solicit first.  Couldn't eat this overpriced slab of meat; ended up in the trash. Will not order again.

Description:

Western Burger
All natural angus beef topped with wisconsin cheddar, 2 slices bacon and an onion ring. Smothered in BBQ sauce served with butter leaf lettuce and tomato on a toasted brioche bun.

Please, I beg someone to show me the \"SMOTHERED\" sauce, the lettuce or tomato, and I may need a refresher on my steak temps.


Edit:  After speaking with Eat24 staff (who ever so generously gave us a whole $5 credit that will never be used), one of the owners, Jerry gave us a call and I spoke with him.  There were a LOT of discrepancies between what we ordered online and what was relayed to LushBurger by Eat24; additionally the food sat for about 45 minutes before being delivered. Regrettably, as a consumer, my perception is reality and all I know is that I was delivered subpar burgers.  Jerry gave me a sincere apology which I appreciated greatly and I am looking forward to giving the restaurant another chance, sans Eat24.  Will update upon resolution."}
{"text":"We walked in last night and sat at the bar. Waited 8-10 mins without a soul speaking to us. Couple next to us complained to the bartender about the long wait for their food. Even with the bartender next to us there was no acknowlegement of our existence. This was our second terrible experience here. 

Last week my wife and daughter went there and were told 25 min wait. Place was almost empty and they were told they didn't have enough staff to handle more customers so they left. They went up the street and got right in at a busy restaurant that cared about customer service.

We are neighbors that live here full time and will not be back. So many great places nearby in DC Marketplace why spend hard earned money here?"}
{"text":"Saw Lush Burger on Check Please Arizona then looked them up on Yelp.  The ratings for service were abysmal.  Complaints that staff were not attentive, had devil-may-care attitudes.  A few moments later I received the Clipper Magazine and as I perused, I saw coupons for Lush Burger.  I decided it was fate and gave them a try.  The patio was full yet inviting but what scared me away was a table full of kids, loud like kids can often  be.  I don't have problems with kids.  I have problems with parents who don't supervise kids when they get out of control.  So I decided to have a peaceful dinner and went inside.  I was seated almost immediately at about 7PM--check.  DJ our server gave us menus and brought us water--check,check!  We ordered the classic with cheese and a plain classic with raw onions--medium rare.  They came out perfectly cooked as were the regular fries and sweet potato fries that we ordered. (Triple check!)  We asked for a spicy sauce and we got the \"House\" hot sauce---absolutely delicious.  DJ came by to see how everything was.  Very attentive lad.  Used the coupons without a problem which helped out with the check (a little bit because our burgers were not the expensive ones to begin with).  
I found everything to be on point during this visit and did not experience what others have in terms of bad service.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a cute little neighborhood burger joint with a great atmosphere.  The patio is swanky for a burger place and the seating inside is cozy booths to bar seats.  We enjoyed the patio and happy hour burgers with a salad. The burgers were decent put the quality of food is not exactly what I expected for the environment.  Hoping to see some improvement on my next visit."}
{"text":"--- WORST EXPERIENCE OF A RESTAURANT TO DATE ---

So as not to waste words on such a sincere and utter disappointment, here's the story in brief:

Over the past year or two, my coworkers have made it a habit to visit Lush Burger on birthdays. They'll each order up a big burger, wash it down with beer, then polish everything off with a \"famous cookie pie\". (NOT for me, but that's their ritual.)

This was my first time joining them for such an experience, and I was excited to visit Lush Burger because I had passed it on my drive in to work nearly every day and had been intrigued by the thought of a new and interesting burger joint every time.

We arrived a little after lunch time - around 1:00 or so. Still, there was a line of people waiting at the front door (about half-a-dozen or so). We waited patiently alongside the others. There was no one at the front desk to greet us, but we didn't think anything of that (at first).

After waiting for 10-15 minutes without being greeted, several of the people in front of us simply turned and left. We engaged others in questioning conversation - all of us confused by being so completely (and even intentionally) ignored.

Before too long, we were the only 4 left standing at the front. It had now been 15-20 minutes of this being snubbed. At one point, we even attempted to get a server's attention by stepping out and calling to her as she walked by, but she swerved and continued on her way.

We could not locate any management. There appeared to be only maybe 3-4 servers, all of them very young - one of whom just kind of walked around with a dazed expression on his face - and of course the one girl who repeatedly & purposefully ignored us in passing.

After over 20 minutes of this genuinely baffling treatment, we were all four of us beside ourselves. I've NEVER experienced anything like this before. We ended up leaving, obviously. (We would never have waited so long had it not been for a \"special occasion\".)

--- POINTS IN CONCLUSION ---

- I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE BEEN SO FULLY AND INTENTIONALLY IGNORED BY ANYONE, LET ALONE A RESTAURANT STAFF. THIS TEAM IS MADE UP OF THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL AND UNPROFESSIONAL BUNCH OF BONEHEADS I HAVE EVER SEEN.

- MISMANAGED, PURPOSEFULLY UNRESPONSIVE, AND OBVIOUSLY DISINTERESTED IN TAKING OUR MONEY, IT'S AN ABSOLUTE MYSTERY TO ME HOW THIS BUSINESS HAS REMAINED OPEN MORE THAN ONE DAY.

--- IMPORTANT PERSONAL DISCLAIMERS ---

*As a reader of this review, you should know that I am EXTREMELY discerning of my one star reviews. In most cases, I will prefer to remain silent rather than bashing on a business's rep.

*It should also be noted that these events occurred well over a month ago and I have purposefully held off on reviewing Lush Burger so as not to do so in a spirit of direct anger or personal slight.

*All that taken into consideration, I would still STRONGLY ADVISE any potential customers to STEER FAR CLEAR of this establishment. To quote one of my coworkers: \"It needs to die off and make room for a business that actually wants customers.\""}
{"text":"I've eaten there a number of times, and each time the food was prepared properly, service was great. I've invited a number of my friends to join me there, and will continue to do so. It's a GREAT place for lunch or Happy Hour! Go and see for yourself. You'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Can't say as I was impressed.  They are going to have to improve the ordering system if they plan to survive.  I can get table service an comparable places for the same, or lower price.  We waited in line for 20 minutes (we were only third in line) just to give our order, and only then did they open up a second register well after the line had snaked out the door.  Even then, the cashier (for lack of a better term for her) was robotic, and constantly interrupting us mid-order.

Once ordered, we waited a normal amount of time for how busy the place was.  The chocolate shake was bitter, the fries arrived cold, and my wife's Infusion burger was less than spicy.  My classic was supposed to be medium (the \"chef's recommendation\") but it was more raw than anything else.

I would try it again, but this place is on a short leash, as not many people will make a second trip out there unless the service and quality takes a huge step forward soon.  If you like a drive and a burger, your better off going to Greasewood Flats."}
{"text":"12/1/2010: UPDATE: I received a very nice message from the GM of Lush as a result of my yelp. He had let me know that he is working with his staff to improve upon experiences like mine. The truth is, the food was pretty good, and the price is even better. Like most newer businesses, it is obvious that there were and are some kinks to get out, but Lush does deserve a chance. I appreciate the GM's concern for my experience, and will make it a point to visit again. These guys do deserve a second chance.

*************************************************************************************

11/30/2010: Ok, so from the parking lot, this place looks great! There are these fashionable white tables, sofas, candles, ect. all over the patio. Once you step inside, still a cool look, but here is how my most recent visit went:

When we arrived, it was a Friday night. You have to order your food at the front counter, and then proceed to a table (think Pei Wei or Sauce). Well, we got to the counter and asked if their happy hour deals were still in effect. The girl taking our orders did not know, so she had to ask someone else. Turns out, they were --- score 1 point for us! Well, I looked at the drink options on their menu and selected a glass of wine. The girl apologized and told me that they don't carry that variety anymore. Ok. I order another variety. Then, my husband ordered a beer and GUESS WHAT! They don't carry that one anymore, either. Hmmmm.... 

Well, after ordering our second choice drinks, we noted that all the tables inside were full, so we proceeded to the patio. It was the end of November, so the weather was a little cooler. We noticed that there were heaters outside, so we asked the server if she could light one up for us. She informed us that they forgot to order propane, so we were out of luck. 

For food, we ordered some sliders. We had ordered cheese on the sliders, but I guess the kitchen forgot. They were pretty slammed by now, so we bit our lip and ate the sliders without. They were pretty good, so that was refreshing. We then ordered a veggie plate which was rather small for the price, and was missing the dip. It took our server 15 minutes or so, and one reminder, to get the dip. Thankfully, we were in good company, so I never noticed the time.

I just kind of feel like they do not know what they are doing here. They need to get their staff all on the same page if they want to survive Scottsdale. The food was good, but the experience could have been better. I might try them again ---- maybe."}
{"text":"Quick to be seated, then slowness started. Finally got my green tea, lukewarm, and eventually some else came up with a quizzical look asking if I've been helped yet. Nope! Ordered the infusion burger and truffle fries. Burger came with green chiles, canned it appears, and the truffle fries were luke warm.  Finished the so so burger, left the fries...you can skip this place if yore looking for your great burger fix for the month like I was."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Shakes, top Shelf Liquor and Flat Screen TV's. Indoor/Outdoor seating. This place is great."}
{"text":"Drive by this place weekdays at lunch time and it's always busy, so we finally decided to try it. We went late on a Saturday afternoon, when there weren't many customers. Net-net is it's OK. Infused burger was juicy and delish, while the turkey burger was drrrrryyyyyy-yyyyyy. Perhaps we should have gone with the fries, but their house \"chips\" come with the meal, so we figured they must be good...they were overdone. We were splitting the two burgers, so we did appreciate that they split them for us without having to be asked. It's definitely better than the McD's next door, in terms of ambiance...and they have a liquor license...but, I'm not lovin' it."}
{"text":"Decidedly average..  I had a green chile cheese burger that supposedly had some \"zing\"- but it had none.  The daughter had Mac and cheese that was obviously right out of the Kraft box.  Some people like that .  Other than some decent sweet potato fries, nothing to differentiate this place from any other burger joint."}
{"text":"Higher end burger joints seem quite the rage lately (well probably more obvious to me as I love a good burger). Tried out Lush Burger with my family and overall everyone was pleased. Many of us are turning into burger snobs so quite critical when it comes to giving a burger place high reviews. 

The kids really liked their fries so definitely try out the sweet potato fries when visiting Lush Burger. The atmosphere / decor was pretty cool and if nice outside definitely sit on the patio. They have really comfy outdoor couches (not ideal for eating a burger on) but great for hanging out with some friends. The burgers were good (maybe a little pricey for what we got) but something I have gone back for a few times. Good meat flavor and seasoned well."}
{"text":"I just have to start this review with a two-word sum-up... Not Impressed...

We were out and about & decided to try Lush due to finding a coupon/flier on our car window. Walked in & immediately overwhelmed by corniness of the decor. We requested to sit outside since it was just a lovely afternoon & it looked like they NEVER clean the seats (they were the cloth ones like by the pool or at a lounge bar). 

We ordered the veggie sticks w/ ranch dipping sauce, the emulsion burger (him), and the veggie \"inside out\" burger (me). This place was over priced and plain... The menu is also not very descriptive. When I ordered the veggie sticks I assumed they would somehow be special. When they set down a plate of sliced jimaca , carrots, & celery I was a little disappointed. Then I thought \"oh! Maybe the ranch dipping sauce is what's special\"... Not in the slightest... It just tasted like plain old Kraft ranch. \"Ranch Dipping Sauce\" my butt...

Then the burgers came out. He said the emulsion burger was not special at all and, in fact, very bland. If they intended you to actually be able to pick up the inside out veggie burger, they were kidding themselves... It came wrapped in paper to help it hold together, but the quinoa-squash patties crumbled immediately. It was a mess to eat, I just wound up using my fork and knife for the whole thing... And it was also very bland. It tasted like the veggies in the burger were doused in italian vinaigrette. I think if they made one thick patty and put it in a bun w/ an actual good sauce instead of Kraft italian dressing, it would be gold. 

Like I said. Not impressed... DEFINITELY not good enough to charge what they charge. We had the above plus I had wine (very good Chardonnay, btw) and he had a Heifewisen and it still came out to $40 bucks...

Thank God we had a buy one, get one free coupon... I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Went back for yet another work lunch....It's super close, so it's convenient.  I decided on the crab cake sliders this time.  They were strange. Didn't look or taste like crab cakes.  I wasn't expecting anything superb, I know Im in a land locked state....This isn't Maryland, home of the Blue Crabs....But damn. It was disappointing!  I ended up ordering an ice cream sundae just to make up for my lack luster lunch....I hopefully won't have to go back for any lunch meetings soon...Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hours that they post for when they close.  Wife's friends came by shortly after 9:00 PM and they were told they were closing.  According to their Yelp hours, they are open till 10 PM on a Saturday night.

Satisfied with my burger but my wife said salad was not as good as prior visits."}
{"text":"Bad service,hostess who cares more about herself, and inattentive staff make this a must avoid! Bar cannot make a standard manhattan. Hamburgers were ok and the fries were only lukewarm...."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. I dined here with a group of coworkers today, and I will never go back. The food is totally over priced, and I have never experienced poorer service. After the waitress took our orders, she never came back. Two in our party still hadn't received food by the time everybody else had finished eating, despite several reminders to the staff walking by. We had to ask multiple times for silverware, condiments, and water refills before getting any of it. We waited 20 mins for our checks, and when we complained to the manager he said they were busy (we were 1 of maybe 5 tables) but that he'd come out shortly. He   never showed. After paying, waited 20 more mins for our cards. The server was sweet but obviously overwhelmed and had zero support."}
{"text":"Appearance:  4 stars.  Upscale burger joint, very nicely appointed.  Full bar, great outdoor seating though inadequate lighting made it hard to read menu.

Service:  2.5 stars.  No hostess stand or sign that says to seat yourself.  Took about 10 minutes for first contact With server.  No silverware when appetizer delivered. 

Food:  2 stars.  Beer was not cold, and glass was warm.  Shrimp appetizer appeared to be shrimp served in beef bouillon-type broth.  The infusion burger was good, with green chiles and pepper jack cheese inside the burger.  Homemade chips were good.

Overall:  2 stars.  We were seduced by the appearance but the food and beer did not live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"I got sick from this place today. The burger was good but the 'chips' that came on the side were odd tasting. Nothing exciting."}
{"text":"Yummy! Nice variety. Good quality. 

If you're jonesing for a burger and your friends want salads or something, yup - they got 'em. Doing the gourmet burger schtick but that's ok if you got the goods. They do. 

Great sides. Nice bar. Terrific service.  Would go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Please keep in mind that they had only been open for 5 days at the time of this review. We went on a Sunday night about 7pm. When we first arrived we were struck by the beautiful interior design. They definitely didn't hold back on the finishes. The restaurant has a very small interior space but they still have a handful of booths and a nice looking burger bar. The patio however was HUGE and done very nicely. It was setup as a comfortable lounge with a lot of different conversation areas, huge umbrellas and live music which was a nice surprise for a Sunday night. The restaurant definitely gets an A+ for ambience.

The rest of the experience however left something to be desired. When you first walk in there is a counter to order from. The menu is pretty basic with burgers (kobe, ahi, turkey), shakes, floats, salads and some side dishes. We ordered the Money Burger (kobe beef) with two iced teas and fries. We wanted the sweet potato fries but they were out so we had to settle for the regular fries. All together it was $37 for two burgers, two orders of fries and two iced teas. A little pricey but hey, it's Scottsdale.

They gave us a number and told us to sit wherever we like. We sat outside on the patio near the musician which was excellent. Our fries arrived immediately and were okay, but nothing special. It seemed a little odd that they fries arrived before the food but at least we had something to snack on while we waited. The iced teas took much longer to arrive.

When the burger finally arrived we were expecting something great. It was not. The Money Burger had a cold bun, a decent tasting Kobe patty, lettuce, tomato and onion. We wanted refills on the drinks but no one came by the table until we were ready to leave. I'm not sure if you are supposed to go back to the counter for refills. It seemed a little confusing. At one point we counted 15 people on staff that we could see however none of them seemed to be checking on tables. 

In general, the atmosphere is great and I could see enjoying a cocktail on the patio with the live music however it looks like they only have beer and wine. The burger was just okay and at almost $40 for two burgers and iced tea it's hard to justify the price. Also with such an upscale atmosphere I really expected table service. It felt like an upscale In-N-Out Burger only the food wasn't as good.

I still have high hopes for this place as I think it has a lot of potential. My fear is that the outside space will be unusable in the coming weeks (which is half the charm of this place) and that the indoor space is too limiting. Try it for yourself, it's at least worth a shot."}
{"text":"Too Scottsdale for me w/ a $16 burger and fries. Cracks me up. Ordered medium and get a well done. Buddy orders the burger with piled high cole slaw and didn't get any cole slaw. Fries under heat lamp probably for a while. Looked forward to coming but now looking forward to never going back unless owner reaches out. So sad because Carl's Jr actually has a better burger.  Maybe it was a Sunday afternoon thing for the cooks but they couldn't get it right. One good thing was the service. 

If you want just another overpriced burger spot with high rent this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Went there with great anticipation.  Wow what a let down. Great concept, great decor and atmosphere.  After waiting 30 minutes in line to order like a busy McDonalds we sat down and waited 45 minutes for our food. The flavor was OK. I had the Infusion Burger my wife had the Ahi Tuna Burger. Both left a lot to be desired. All bun very little Burger. Food was cold toasted buns weren't toasted. Her medium rare tuna was cold and well done. My rare Infusion Burger was cold and well done.  Took our kids their kids Burger minis look about the same. Bottom line 46 bucks for cold over cooked burgers and crappy truffle fry's. Skip it.. I wont be back. Its too bad but it is a great concept in a great location.  Like a wanna be cowboy its \"all hat and no horse\"."}
{"text":"First time at Lush Burger with my grandson - I was expecting more from the establishment after reading excellent reviews in the local papers. We were very impressed with the decor and local atmosphere - the owners clearly invested in the design of their establishment and we felt comfortable and cozy! 

But the burgers were really disappointing. My grandson had to return his sliders because they had hard gristle in them. The buns were COLD - whether this was an accident or whether the chef took the decision not to heat the buns - either way, it takes away from the experience. 

I will definitely go back and try the burgers again - and this time ask for the buns to be heated!"}
{"text":"Yum! This is one of my favorite \"gourmet burgers\" in the valley. This is right by work so I like to go here for lunch a couples times a month. 

The interior of the place is super hip and retro. You used to order at the counter but they changed it sit down with a waitress. I honestly prefer this better since I feel like the servers actually make some money now. There are plenty of booths and an awesome patio to choose from and the lunch time crowd is not too large so you will get a seat right away. 

They have a lunch time special which comes out to be around 11 bucks. All of the burgers are tasty and you get your cheese selection. White cheddar is noms but I also like American cheese. When I recently went, I tried the Philly Burger. Provolone cheese and giardiniera (which was nice an oily and good spice) I think the burger needs some sort of sauce. 

YOU HAVE TO GET THE ONION RINGS! Get there chipotle, infusion sauce. OMG! Some of the best onion rings I have had. 

To go: I would not recommend getting anything to go. The burgers get to soggy."}
{"text":"My friend heard about this place on that local show, Check Please. The food was alright. I ordered the crab cake sliders and a side of sweet potato fries. The fries were fine but the crab cakes were just eh. Not sure if they were overcooked or formerly frozen but just thin, dark patties.  It was a very cute restaurant but the server was equivalent to that you would receive at a fast food place or Denny's, I imagine, since it's been years since I went somewhere like that. She came up and said, \"Are you ready to order?\". No introduction, nothing, and came back twice more with the same question interrupting our conversation. I don't blame her since she looked like she was barely 18 years old and I didn't see a single true adult working there... it could be the lack of training. When service is bad and food is mediocre I never plan to return. Too bad since I was excited to try this place and the location is great."}
{"text":"Our first and last trip to this restaurant tonight! Service was poor...even had to ask the bartender for napkins and utensils to eat our dinner that was delivered as our server/busser never brought us any. Food was decent at best....\"seared\" ahi was actually medium well ahi on my sandwich. Portions were small in my opinion...too bad, as we had heard some good things about this place in the past."}
{"text":"Really good gourmet burgers and salads.

I like the Inside-out burger which is a vegetarian plate with quinoa patties. The flavors are really good and it's always a treat.

But I also love their Blue cheeseburger!

Their burgers are served with their house made chips which are excellent but I always substitute in the sweet potato fries because they are my favorite.

Very nice to sit at the bar the staff is always friendly.

The outdoor patio has very comfortable seating for cocktails but the couches aren't really made for eating a meal. It's a really nice place to hang out on a beautiful afternoon."}
{"text":"We purchased a gift certificate on Localdines.com.  My bf knows Josh one of the owners and Matt Carter one of the consultants.   Josh told us the 50 certificates that were offered on Localdines.com sold out in about an hour.  So I guess we were one  of the lucky ones.

We had the Lush Classic, Lush Infusion and Truffle fries.  I love the root beer on draft.  It is made by a brewery I used to work for called Sonoran Brewing Co.   Ben had a Coke.   My burger was simple with cheddar cheese.  The menu said white cheddar but it was yellow.   My burger was very messy yet cooked a perfect medium rare.  I love the brioche rolls.  Messy meaning grease was running down my arm which was a turn off.   Everything was sliding all over the place.   Ben enjoyed his Infusion with Harris Ranch premium, all natural angus beef infused with roasted green chiles & infused with pepper jack cheese served with a chipotle spread on a grilled brioche bun.  The truffle fries were intoxicating.  I am a major sucker for truffles.  

I would definitely make it back.  I am dying to try the shakes & malts.  The smores - chocolate ice cream shake with graham cracker crumbs finished with toasted marshmallow.  Lately, I am craving toasted marshmallows.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"First time here. Clean. Loved sitting outside.  Nice background music.  manager (Sam I think)was very attentive. He agreed with my sib that her burger was more well done than ordered & promptly took care of it. I had salad with balsamic Vinagrette. Large portion and loved the dressing. Waiter was also very nice and polite.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great value, very friendly. Easy to order with a great Happy hour menu."}
{"text":"First time here, had high expectations. Place was very busy for a lunch crowd on Monday. 
 Reading the menu some of the burgers sounded delicious and out of this world. We decided to try the lushios infusion and the hangover, we tried one with fries and the other with chips since we were going to share. 
  I'm sorry to say that they were average, not anything to write home about and nothing to really rave about. There could've been so much more.... 
Service was unimpressive and at times nonexistent, it was a $35 lunch that was way over priced."}
{"text":"Waited forever to get our lunch. Meanwhile our server was standing behind the counter picking at her face.  Very appetizing.  Grossed me out."}
{"text":"I was totally diggin' this place!  Now, the best part of dining is the company you keep, and I am certain that had everything to do with it, as I was with two of my best besties!  :-)

Went on a Sunday, after hiking Pinnacle Peak.  It seems fancy schmancy on the outside, but it's not.  Service was casual but awesome.  LOVED the half-and-half fries, and LOVED my little sliders.  In fact, I could only eat two of the three.  I actually thought this place was a pretty good value on a Sunday afternoon.

Note: GREAT place for kids on Sundays!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch right at 1100 AM on a weekday.  The service was great.  I had read the service wasn't the best, but being there early was probably a big plus since hardly anyone was there yet.  Food came fast and waitress was great.

I had the Lushburger classic and a chocolate thin mint shake.  Both were really good.  I'm downgrading my rating though because I don't like that they default to dry crunchy chips instead of fries.  This is America.  We want fries as the default with a burger!  I saw later that the menu does say this and the waitress did ask me if I wanted fries when I was ordering, but I was confused how she said it and didn't understand until I got chips instead.  bleh.  Also, if you do want fries it's $2 extra!  $3 extra for sweet potato fries.  This makes a traditional burger $12-13.  A little high for what you get, IMO.

In general though, good quality burger and great shake!"}
{"text":"I thought I would update my reviews of Lush Burger ... I recently had an opportunity to have dinner there again, and it certainly seems to be evolving for the better.  They have converted to a full service model with waiters/waitresses coming to your table (nicer than the previous order at the register approach) which seems more appropriate for a higher end burger restaurant.  Their patio is fantastic in nice weather - an easy, comfortable place to enjoy an April evening!  Food seems to have improved as well - we had a Classic Burger, and an Infusion Burger - the green chilis on the infusion burger were excellent! - along with some sweet potato fries.  A couple of nice craft beers on draft as well for the beer fans!  Overall, I enjoyed and looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Usually go here and have a great time but today something was off. Rude staff uncooked food and warm drinks. It's really disappointing since me and my family come here often. Need a new place!"}
{"text":"This is not family friendly. No changing tables in the men's room or the women's room. My wife did not appreciate changing my daughter on the floor. 

Delicious and beautiful food. Burgers were great and the fresh fruit was ripe and juicy. 

Server was slightly less attentive than I would have liked considering there were very few customers."}
{"text":"Lush burger is a very cute burger restaurant hid away in this shopping center by AJs. I had a  farmers salad and my husband had a classic burger. My salad was crunchy,light and exactly what I wanted. My husband enjoyed his classic burger. He is a Burger expert and it would definitely be his last meal if he had a choice! 
 I had a bite because he said the bun was really nice. I think I read it was a brioche bun. It was very good."}
{"text":"I came to Lush Burger because it was an outdoor patio with TV's (2) with NFL sunday ticket. I called ahead to make sure they would have the Chargers game on outside, and the people I talked to on the phone were really nice. The outdoor patio is comfortable and nicer looking. I was rather annoyed that my game wasn't put on for 15 minutes because the manager/owner was under the mistaken impression that cable networks & the NFL delays the start of afternoon games when a morning game runs over (false and they were one different networks anyways). After getting over missing half of the first quarter, the rest of our time there progressed nicely. 

They have all day happy hour on Sunday with $4 beers and appetizer specials (though there is no app section on their menu, so....?).  I had the veggie burger which was okay. It didn't come with a bun or cheese (bummer) and was served kinda cold, but the flavors were good. The patty is made with quinoa & squash, so is a little nutty and sweet tasting. I got a side salad which was served in a ridiculous tilted bowl that made the salad come flying out whenever I tried to put a fork in it. I appreciate the fancy dishware but when it's causes me to lose my food to the ground, well, no thanks. My boyfriend had the western burger which was giant and looked kinda hard to eat, but he really liked it. The lush fries were good, a little on the dry side, but I had no problem finishing the basket. I thought it was a little on the pricey side ($15 for a burger & fries & no beverage) but since my football team isn't on local networks I don't really have a choice."}
{"text":"I really like that Lush Burger took the time to make a pretty amazing burger for Vegetarians. It really is not your typical veggie burger! With two toasted,\"bun-free\" quinoa, grilled zucchini & squash patties surrounding roasted peppers, avocado, arugula and served with a balsamic reduction it is a mouth sensation. The sweet potato fries are a great side for a very nice lunch. Well done Lush."}
{"text":"Man, it seems I have been giving a lot of two stars lately.  I was in the mood for a burger and in the Scottsdale area with my nephew.  We decided to give Lush Burger a try.  We sat outside (first off - BAD IDEA - there are FLIES everywhere trying to take a nibble off your gobble).  

First, we ordered the chicken wings - completely MEDIOCRE at best (I am a wing junkie and this is one I would never order again, respectfully).

From there, ordered the burger, fries (both regular and truffle) and we each got a burger (I went with the \"Western\" which is basically like a carls Jr. \"western bacon cheeseburger.\"  Burger was pretty good (Gigantic, even a big mouth like me had trouble taking a bite if you like those kinds of burgers) but not amaze balls or anything like that.

Finally, being a foodie connoisseur, tried their deserts.  Lush was pretty good in this area.  Had their peanut butter shake - DELISH, and their cinnamon donuts (Lushpuppies I think they call them), also very good although seemed like they were not fully deep fried in the middle, but all in all the deserts were the best part of the meal.

Attorney Steve Tip: When I ate here, (while chewing) the thought kept occurring to me \"I wish I was at Bobby Q's\" off the 17th.  That is the best burger around, and their cinnamon donuts (FREE AT THE END OF YOUR MEAL) are better than Lush.  I know this is completely digressing and on the other side of town, but if it were me, I would take my nephew to Bobby Q's next time.  IN fact, I told my nephew that.  You might want to do yourself the favor and head their in the first place if you are looking for the KILLER BURGER.  I wrote a review on them so check that out for more specific information.  Anyway, when I start daydreaming about other restaurants, that is when I pull out the two star.  Sorry guys, your place seemed real nice and all (waitress and staff were exceptional, let me not forget to give a shout out for that) but I don't think I will be stopping in again.

Peace out

Find your Sizzle!

{"text":"We stood in the front awkwardly for some time, waiting to be seated, but no one stopped to help us although there were plenty of employees walking around and noticing us. When we finally did get a booth, we got to overhear a male bartender talking to his female coworkers hanging at the bar about his \"crazy party\" stories, how drunk he got, and what his next weekend plans were. They were young, I get it, that's what young people do, but the conversation was not professional to be having on a fairly busy day in front of customers. The food itself was very so/so, I've already forgotten about it which must mean I don't have a reason to return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time because we were in the area for a soccer tournament. Kids eat free with a jersey so that was nice. Burger was nothing special and did not really have any flavor. The homemade chips were good and the server was friendly. Overall I would try this place again but would not go out of my way to go there because you can find a better burger other places."}
{"text":"The great, good, bad, and ugly:     Let me clarify my review: I view  3 stars as a \"C\" rating. I fully intend to try Lush again, but I was aware of very mixed reviews, and I hope the owners are reading the same reviews. The great: the wait staff is awesome. They were friendly, fast, knowledgeable. Lush gets huge points for their patio - large with lounge furniture, tables, lights in the trees, great ambiance - and one of the reasons i will try it again. The good: great location, size, and design. Menu is good, but they could expand it a bit. My Philly burger was good - not great. They cooked the meat perfectly as ordered, but there just needed to be more flavor.....perhaps my fault for not ordering the one with green chili and pepper jack. The large portion of Angus beef validates the price on the burger, but needed some seasoning of some kind while on the grill. The bad: our drinks were not good. If they say they have a \"top shelf\" margarita, they need to get rid of the too-sweet/lime punch mix they use. There are too many tequila and margarita aficionados in this area to not do that well. My lemon drop martini needed some fresh lemon juice, as well. It depended strictly on lemon vodka and came off harsh and lacking actual lemon flavor. The ugly: the women's bathroom was filthy. Whomever decided an all-white bathroom was a good idea should personally have to retile the floor. I don't have a problem with dirty footprints on a white floor. I DO have a problem with the weeks of \"scrunge\" built up on the edges of the floor and in corners, around the toilet - which a wet mop didn't even attempt to clean. However, the mop did manage to leave dirt and filth on the white walls. Lovely. It also smelled less than fresh. Every restaurant manager knows to re-clean and check the restrooms before their busiest dinner shift of the week. By improving just the basics, this could be a great place. It just isn't \"there\" yet.
2nd visit: great burger, extremely slow service, had to asked for flatware after receiving food, no refills on tea and dinner took 1 1/2 hrs."}
{"text":"There isn't much I love more in life than a good burger but unfortunately this place does not deliver. My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a Thursday night hoping for a quick dinner. Boy were we in for a disappointment. Our waiter was working hard so I certainly don't blame him - but it took 40 minutes for us to get our food. And when it arrived it was not good. I ordered my meat medium, and it was delivered hockey puck. The outside was charred to a crisp and there was absolutely no pink inside at all. It was over-well done and barely edible. What was left of the patty was so minuscule that once I cut the burger in half (it was mostly bread and toppings) there was only a sliver of meat on one side. It's really too bad because this is less than a mile from home but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We have tried this place a couple of times, each time hoping our memory of the last was just a bad dream.  Sadly, I can't recommend this place.  It is dirty, staffed with kids that could care less and the food is straight off the Sysco truck tossed in hot oil.  

I cringe to think what the kitchen looks like to be honest based off what the front of house looks like.  For the money, you can find far better establishments with fresh, local food and a skilled staff.  I understand that people have to learn somewhere but the problem here is the complete lack of oversight and management.  I feel like I am at one of the servers dorm rooms.  

One positive note and I am assuming it's the only thing keeping this place afloat, is it is extremely kid friendly both in atmosphere and pallet."}
{"text":"Nicely greeted,great tunes ,questions answered,great choices,great food.full belly.loved it!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Lush Burger often over the past few months. Our experience overall has been great. The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the food is consistent.

The lunch special is 2 dollars plus the price of the burger you order. I usually get the Lushburger classic (normally $8) with sweet potato fries and an iced tea. I like my hamburgers medium to medium well, and Lushburger delivers. The sweet potato fries are fantastic, and you can get the iced tea in a giant to-go cup to take with you after you leave. So for $10 I get a great meal. Sometimes my mom and I even split it.

Yes, the burger is pricey. But in North Scottsdale, it's pretty hard to get a lunch under $10 that isn't Subway or In N Out. And you can only eat at AJ's and Wildflower so many times. I tried the new BluBurger location at the Summit (North Scottsdale and Lone Mountain) but was not impressed. Around the same price but the atmosphere and quality was lacking."}
{"text":"I don't know we're to start. Do not go here! Food is not good. The wings are rubbery and raw. The do not fry them . It looks like they are microwaved. Oh, the pizza oh my god the worst. Bought dough with toppings. Pizza was raw on the bottom with little pin holes like you by at the store.  The burger was a insult to burgers. It had funny taste. The truffle fries we'll not good.  What a wast of money I could have gone to any fast food chain would taste better and would cost less than half. They should be ashamed. I will Never go back."}
{"text":"Lack of service and brusqueness of staff ruins what could be a good place to eat. Seems to be going downhill..."}
{"text":"Gave them another shot and went in with an open mind.  Unfortunately, the only improvement has been with the service, which is very friendly.  We arrived before the lunch rush and I ordered their lunch special which was a burger, fries and soda.  I ordered a medium burger with cheddar cheese and no onions.  Twenty minutes later, I got a well done burger with onions and swiss cheese.  My fries were soggy but the iced tea I ordered was nice a cold!

Sorry, just can't deal with something that is so simple to do.  I mean, millions of us can do burgers and fries in the backyard perfectly..."}
{"text":"Hate to do it, but I had a bad experience at Lush Burger. Went on a Tuesday for lunch. Food took 45 minutes to arrive. Went it did, the burger that I had coooked was well done, not medium. The oriental salad was drowning in salad dressing.

The fries and sauces ( we had the mixed regular and sweet potatoe) were cold and average.

The only saving grace was the frequent service and professionalism of our server ( Chelsea??), I think.  She askked the manager to give us a discount which turned out to be 15%....

I would give this place a definite miss. I will never go back."}
{"text":"we shall not be coming back.  new management does not get it, service sucks, food quality has suffered, and coupons no longer are accepted. we feel you will be long gone in a short time, as the folks are not stupid.  we have too many burger choices in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this place. The burgers are delicious and the beer is ice cold. The bartender Sammy is the reason i frequent this place so much. If you can, grab yourself a spot at the bar. The burger of the month is always spot on, but don't hesitate to ask Sammy for his secret wings. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"Personally, I am never going back to Lush Burger. Rather than try to convince you to follow my lead, allow me to simply recount my recent lunch experience and you can decide for yourself. 

I was reading the \"Scottsdale Airpark News\" the other day and noticed a coupon for a $10 lunch combo special. This special is also published on Lush Burger's profile page in the iPhone yelp app . The special included a classic \"Lush Burger\", a side of fries, and a fountain drink. 

I decided to sit at the bar. The bartender asked if I wanted a menu, and I told him that it wasn't necessary as I have already decided to get the $10 lunch special. He asked me what type of fries I would like and proceeded to list them, \"regular, sweet potato or truffle fries\"? I asked for the truffle fries. The food was very good. The truffle fries not quite as good as Zinc Bistro's but still fairly tasty. The Burger was fantastic, cooked perfectly (medium) with a nice mild sauce and fresh, crisp vegetables.  

Then the bill came.... $13.44. As usual at restaurants, there were three slips in the bill so I looked at the itemized version... 

Lunch Combo Special - $12.00 
Tax - $1.44 
Total - $13.44 
 
Now the moment of truth, do I ask about this at risk of feeling cheap or do I just pay it and leave considering the hamburger was so good. On principal, I asked the bartender about the $2 difference. Rather than apologize, he began to explain that their computer sometimes does that, and then he asked \"you had the truffle fries right?\" I said \"yes, that was one of the options you gave me after I told you I wanted the special\". He thought about it for a moment and explained how he was going to try and work it out on the computer. He came back, dropped off a single (non-itemized) slip for $11.44 and hastily made his way all the way over to the other side of the bar and began slicing lemons. Another moment of truth... Should I ask about it, or just leave? I decided to ask. Rather than walk over to me he just nodded from across the way to see what I wanted. \"What's the $1.44 for?\" I asked loud enough so he could hear me over there... \"Tax\" he curtly replied. At this point I decided just to pay and leave.  

What really bothers me is now I am the one who is going to feel guilty all afternoon for getting so worked up over a measly two dollars and change. How silly of me to think that lunch on a beautiful Friday afternoon should be a pleasant experience. 

In case you were wondering, according to the \"internet\", sales tax in AZ is around 7% and Scottsdale adds another 1.65% on top of that. So I don't really know where that other 6% \"tax\" came from (on that extra $1.44). He probably just subtracted $2 from my original bill, or maybe restaurants have some other tax obligations that I am missing but I smell something fishy in this burger joint."}
{"text":"We really like Lush Burger!

Most of their burgers are in the $9 range and all are flavorful and delicious!  The burgers are so big sometimes that you might need to use a knife and fork.  Or, maybe it was just the size of their Pittsburgh ($12.99) which was huge.

Another plus for Lush Burgers is their Happy Hour which runs until 7 pm.  They have four or five beers on tap and their wine list which is not huge, IS very good.  And, now that the cooler weather (low nineties and high eighties) is here, you have the added benefit of sitting outside.  And, even though they aren't a sports bar, they have enough flat screen TVs around the bar area, so you won't feel you are missing a game.

When you order, consider the sweet potato french fries or the beer batter onion rings as sides.  Both are very good.  

I can also recommend their salads, particularly the Cobb.  But ask for extra dressing.

BTW, I don't know how Lush Burger does it, but the wait staff is a very happy young group, who go out of their way to get you whatever you want.  We have never seen them flustered, or annoyed and ... they're always .. . well, happy.  It's both extraordinary and very nice; and makes for a fun dining experience.  

Enjoy!

PS, -- From time to time the weekly mail bulletins have coupons and if you fill out their email card, you will also get some discounts via the internet."}
{"text":"Let's see where to begin, the menu states that all burgers are cooked to medium and had ordered it that way but it came out well over done! Also the chicken sandwich which is way over priced($9) for just two fried chicken strips on sandwich, come on you can get way better chicken sandwich at chick fil a for half that price! Plus to add on to it the chef/ kitchen staff doesnt know how to run a kitchen and an owner that doesnt know how to run a restaurant.... Over all will never return!!!"}
{"text":"I am totally straddling the fence right now about LB. Here is the breakdown:
I like:      the decor- cool, clean and inviting.
               the food we had- I was a big fan of the veggie \"burger\" 2 veg patties with basically a salad in between. I smushed it up and ate it as a salad (and I added ketchup, but that is an issue of mine). It was really good! 
               the onion rings! nummers!!!!!
Pretty good- the sweet potato fries. I really liked them because they were kinda crisp but kinda soft- the best combo in my opin.

Not so great- The service?!?!?!!??!!??!!! 
                         Ordering at the front makes you :
                          A. feel like a retard if someone is waiting ahead of you, 
                          B. feel unwelcome and awkward 
                          C. feel on the spot to order
                          D. What happens if you want to order another drink/dessert/whatever???????????????
                          E. What about refills on drinks??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? It took 2.6 minutes for the counter guy to run through all that were offered but no amount of blatant sucking noises got us a second refill.
I think they should forgo the counter and hire a wait staff. For the prices you pay, you deserve a little bit more love."}
{"text":"Under new ownership.  Nearly all items up $2 to $3 each with no perceptible change in quality.  Burgers always great and still are. Cobb salad up $5 to $15 with more lettuce, less other ingredients, and no pretzel roll included as before.  Roll is now an extra $5 with salads."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty cute and nice! However, their food is literally the worst. We got pretzels that were burnt to a crisp. The slider was smothered in thousand island and it was DISGUSTING. Basically I'd rather eat a napkin than come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is meh. Came here cause everyone was raving about the veggie burger. We stood in the doorway with a bunch of ppl for 10mins without as much \"hey things really suck right just a sec\" or anything. The veggie burger is just thiese mushy patties with salad in the middle. It fell apart when you tried to pick it up and to be honest for 10 bucks wasnt all that filling. I wish it was on a bun. I had to leave because customers were practically climbing in my lap for my seat. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Burger, perfectly cooked!! Great atmosphere and service was curious. Thanks Lush I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We are in town for the week from Connecticut and everybody said we had to try Lush Burger. They all said that the burgers are awesome. It takes a lot to impress me and I am not a believer until I see for myself. So we went down on Sunday at 5:30 PM for dinner. I immediately liked how they had a nice friendly hostess who greeted us as soon as we walked up. She told the waitress we wanted too eat inside and we were taken directly to a table that seated 6 with plenty of room. Did I mention I had a raging headache from spending the afternoon in the sun watching monster trucks at the fairgrounds? Let's just say I was not in the mood to be out in public. But we hit the jackpot with our waitress Ashley. I asked if they served Diet Dr. Pepper and she said no. They only have Diet Coke. She said she could mix half Diet Coke and half Dr. Pepper for me though. It's her own personal creation. I said yes please and she was right. Wierdly tasty. Now for the burger. I ordered the Lush Burger minus onion and lettuce. Added tomato, pepperjack cheese, jalapeños and pickles medium rare. It comes with thousand island on the side. Nice touch, fancy. You order a medium rare burger and by God you get a medium rare burger. My burger was just as great as all the hype I kept hearing about. Home run. Another cool thing was that, even though it was super juicy, the bun didn't get mushy or fall apart even to the very end. Lets not forget to mention the sweet potato fries. They are the best I have had anywhere. They should explain to the rest of the country that this is how they should be done. As soon as I finished, I got up, went to the restroom, completely washed the run off off of my hands and reached for a paper towel. What , the dispenser was completely out. For the first time ever I was not upset in the least. The complete opposite, looks as though many before me had come in and done the same exact thing and used them all up. Gave my hands a good shake and headed back to my seat where another fresh Diet Dr. Coke was waiting. Best part, headache gone and a tasty memory of a great burger and fries. My suggestion would be to management,  put a picture of Ashley on the wall for Employee of the Month."}
{"text":"I just bought a place in the area and found a coupon for Lush Burger in my mailbox. So I decided to give them a try. I am very glad I did.

I walked in and was quickly greeted by a waitress not working at the bar. I told her I just wanted to place a to go order and she pointed to the bar. I walked up to the bar and was promptly greeted. I had to take a minute to look at the menu to decide what I wanted. I decided to go with the Infusion Burger and an order of sweet potato fries. \"WOW\" is all I can say about that burger. Perfectly cooked. It was super juicy and was full of flavor. I enjoyed all the toppings on it. It gave it a great taste without over-powering the flavor of the beef. The sweet potato fries were good. 

The only negative that I could say is that the bartender seemed either extremely stressed out or a bit on the cold side. But nonetheless, I don't judge on little things like that on a first visit. We all have bad days.

I HIGHLY recommend people to check this place out. Since it is literally walking distance from my house, I think I will be dropping in time to time for happy hour."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time we tried Lush Burger. The service was, again, slow. The wait staff took a while to come to the table with menus and to take our drink orders. My husband and I ordered sliders with sweet potato fries. Lets be honest here. The menu is not that big. The quality of the sliders left a lot to be desired. There were only about 4 other people dining when we were seated. It took quite a while for our order - my husband even commented about it. We order sliders because they are smaller and faster to cook - but not here evidently. And the fries and the burgers were exceptionally greasy. And there were black burned bits on my plate along with grease puddles under the burgers. The fries were like limp sweet potato noodles. Yuck. You have a great location and could have an outstanding product. What is so hard about making good food? You have lost us as customers. You should be visited by Restaurant Stakeout. And having \"Cooky\" with his dirty clothes out in the restaurant chatting up the customers at the bar - eeeuuuuuuuwwwwwww! Bye bye Lush Burger. It should be a gold mine but I guess management doesn't really care."}
{"text":"Mid afternoon...more staff than customers and still lousy service.  After 10 minutes I asked for a menu.  The girl with her arm in a sling(for management) stood 2 ft from my table and threw the menu across the spilled thousand island dressing.
Right this minute all the staff are laughing, hooting, running back and forth from the back booth...as the 3 customers sit here unattended.

Took 25 minutes for the burger to come out. It was fine.

The problem here is the staff. They are terrible.  A bunch of kids talking about each other, swearing and talking about the customers.

Management...fix this and maybe you can survive."}
{"text":"The burgers were tall and juicy. Pulled high with the fixings. We got their French fries and onion rings. Both were crisp and delicious. Iced tea was good as well"}
{"text":"Much more than just a burger joint!   Hip place with nicely appointed interior.   You can get a shot of Glenlivet scotch and follow it up with a monster Oreo Cookie milkshake.   Sure, you'll pay $10 for your burger but it'll be cooked right and served with a smile.  My bartender / waiter, Nick, was all over it.   Order the sweet potato fries and aioli sauce -- made on site and outstanding!"}
{"text":"Lush Burger is the best in North Scottsdale! Family friendly atmosphere & completely accommodates the protein only mommy's"}
{"text":"First time here, food was decent service was decent. I don't think for $12 this is a great value and quite frankly I think that either a burger made it home or even a chain burger shop like in and out is actually better in taste. For those that love the gourmet style burger maybe this is a good spot but for me save your money and cook it at home."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants we have been to in Scottsdale! My boyfriend and I are routine diners in where we always go to the same places we love and this is a definite on our list! 

If you can make if for happy hour they have the best! 4-7 (which is later than most in the area). The beef sliders on a pretzel bun are heaven in your mouth! $2 on happy hour! So bomb. We've also had the pretzels and cheese which is phenomenal. (We like pretzels.) They have so many gourmet burgers to choose from and they even serve pizza! We've been eyeing the shakes too which we'll probably get before we leave. :) :) yum! 

Over all, this place is the bomb and it's definitely worth coming! You will be hooked!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful dining experience. I thought the food was wonderful and I will certainly go back again. Our table started with the fried mozzarella  appetizer and then we had a couple burgers, french fries and a Cobb salad.  The food was delicious, served in a very timely manner, and served at the correct temperature.  The greeter at the door prompg in seating us, our server was very attentive but not hovering, just perfect.  It was a bit chilly the night we dined there so we sat inside where it was very comfortable although the music was just a bit loud, in my opinion. The outside patio on a warm day will be wonderful.  I would not hesitate to give \"Lush Burger\" a big thumbs up and I will go back again and would expect the food to be every bit as good next time .  This was my first time dining experience here and it certainly impressed me."}
{"text":"I love this burger place, great servers, nice atmosphere, TV, decent cocktails, prices are in line with other places in N. Scottsdale. Only complaint I have had is the inability to cook my Angus burger medium well, it always comes out med or med rare ! last 3 times it was under cooked, they will correct it if you ask though. My next burger will be sent back if it's not right."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here this weekend after having been here several times now. They have really good food, I ordered the Frank's Red Hot Chicken Sandwich, it was delicious. My only gripe was the the Sandwich itself was really tough to eat and kept falling apart because it was several pieces of chicken and the bun got flimsy really quickly... Their sweet potato fries are next level also, be sure you or someone your party orders them, too good...

Reasons I gave it fours stars:
-Multiple Good Experiences
-Great Food
-Excellent Service
-Kept very clean

Here are the reasons it isn't five star:
-Really expensive for what it is... (still worth it tho)
-Decor is a bit cheesy
-Layout of restaurant is a bit funky in my opinion, awkward seating..."}
{"text":"I've been in here twice, and I wasn't impressed either time. The first time I was hung over, so I thought I'd try again just in case my judgement was skewed, but it wasn't. The burgers are bun heavy - as in there's so much bun you can barely taste the guts. The guts weren't that impressive on either of the burgers that I tried. The service is terrible. The bar doesn't carry some of the most common things (Jameson). I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow the Maui Burger is amazing!!!  The onion rings are the best I have ever had!   Pricey for lunch, but very high quality food!"}
{"text":"Most unprofessional restaurant I've ever stepped foot into. Sat at the bar for 5 minutes and no one even took time to say hello. Followed up with- the servers complaining about how slow it is and how their are crap and then hearing the manager talk about punching a customer In the face because she was complaining. Lucy, walking three feet away and kissing another coworker is very unprofessional too as well as talking crap about my strange and distrusting order I placed. You are a joke of a human being. Next time when a customer walks in and sits at the bar try acknowledging them instead of continuing to shoot the breeze with your friends at the other end of the bar eating fries. 

Never stepping foot into this dump again."}
{"text":"we have had burgers cooked to order and a couple others not. The management took care of us both times, so good marks for that."}
{"text":"Had a pretty awful experience here. Found this place on Yelp and thought it couldn't be that bad but...it was. The first thing that happened was we ordered some draft beers and they were flat. The server seemed a little surprised when we tried to send them back. We got the replacement beer and it turned out the keg needed to be switched out. My boyfriend is a vegetarian and wanted to get a veggie burger but with a bun so he ordered one of the regular burgers and substituted a veggie patty. The food came out wrong obviously and instead of a regular burger with a veggie patty he got two veggie patties but with the meat patty inside. I'm not sure how you screw that up but they seem to have managed to. The server took off the \"up charge\" but we still got charged for both burgers. There was no apology, and no manager came by. I don't even think I saw a manager the whole time. It's not that we needed or wanted a free burger, but it's a pretty horrid thing when you serve a vegetarian a burger with meat it in especially when he specifically told the server he didn't eat meat. Will definitely not be going back just based on the service, or lack of."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for burgers and salads.. Great service, drinks, happy hour and fun atmosphere inside and outside dining! Did i mention that the prices are very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to Lush Burger for a hamburger, fries, and a delicious chocolate malt. The sizes were great.  The tastes were impeccable.  The shake was large, chocolate dripping down the sides of the glass and the metal tumbler served with it which had enough for a second glass.  I went there Sunday night to share my \"great place\" with a friend.  Well....they were out of malt again....for days it seems.  The size was small and not typical presentation. The food was overlooked.  The waiters were chatting and ignoring messy dishes on tables that needed removal. Our waters weren't even refilled.  I will NEVER go back again. I was so embarrassed."}
{"text":"AWEFUL!!!

Food: burgers come on a bun that 3times too big and dry, a bun can really make the burger. Inside the burger is what you mom used to make as a kid, big old plump dry patty that 2 inches wide and 2 inches thick.
Fries, thin soggy and cold as the must have just been sitting there for an hour rather than making fresh hot ones as a customer would expect.
Price $10 for the burger but if you want fries...guess what that's $3 more.
Also ordered farmers salad which was supposed to be a garden salad with lots of veggies. The issue is the top with canned corn and frozen vegetables. Are you kidding me? Dressing was store bought low end, the kind that you would see as a grocery store brand. Unetible!

Service: it's run by kids and they could really care less about how you are doing and pay much attention to you. Waitress asked \"are you done?\" which we replied yes and she just threw the bill down and walked away.

Decor: it's nice and should say swanky but that cannot make up for what a complete joke this restaurant is who could care less about quality or service. Also, note that this place is filthy, the floors have grease all over it and you will notice that when u sit down under your table.

For essentially $20 for a burger fries and soda, run away run far far away. This place wont last. Don't waste your time or money here.
I honestly know that in and out is far better and that's fast food."}
{"text":"Love the ambience, but the service and food is pretty horrific for so many reasons.

1. Burgers are pretty tasteless, no effort to season meat and clear they don't clean the grill.

2. Service is some of the slowest I've seen. We had a party of 6, and be aware they charge a 20% gratuity but don't tell you. It was clear our waitress was paying much more attention to the smaller parties. Guessing she figured she already got the 20% and didn't want to make the effort. After 20 minutes, had to go to the bar for refills.

3. For a nicer restaurant, they serve the smallest, cheapest cups for soft drinks. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time there . Mens room floor was sticky, yech, Waitress was not good. Order came out wrong. Ok was it her fault or the kitchens? Didn't matter because it wasn't smothered in sauce, so I ate it anyways . Checked on our table midway through our meal, but failed to refill water and ice tea. Finally came out and I had to ask for refills, she needed to be more observant of the customer needs.
Food was good, tasty and reasonably priced.
I was charged $3.75 for the ice tea, it was printed on the menu $2.50. I suspect that the price went up on the tea because go the new minimum wage in AZ.  I waited a little while for her to come back so I could ask her about it, but left after she didn't show."}
{"text":"Love this place !!!
Food and service is always amazing !!! 
Marley, Lucy and Dale are just the best !!! 

Game zone truck for kids on Sunday's so we can watch the games is just an added plus"}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership so give it another try. It's worth stopping in for a drink just to see the stylish decor - cowhide barstools, chrome chandeliers, red and black booths, textured steel panels,etc. The patio is huge and hip. You can't find a better place to hangout with friends, have a drink and share sweet potato fries. During nice weather, there's live music on the patio and I've heard it can get crowded. Happy hour is 4-7 everyday with cheap food and drink specials! The bartender Kristin is very accommodating and fun to joke around with. The burgers are upscale and the prices are great. A nice surprise in North Scottsdale. I haven't tried the lunch special but intend to soon. Lush Burger is located just a short distance from the intersection of Hwy 101 and Pima. (Go North on Pima.) It's in the AJ's shopping center so there's a ton of parking."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Food wasn't bad but nothing to write home about. Service was efficient but not noteworthy. Pretty standard burger joint with some odd decor. All in all it was a place I'd go if I was in the area and didn't want fast food but didn't want to shell out a ton of money."}
{"text":"Two classic hamburgers, (least expensive on the menu) two milkshakes, and one order of sweet potato fries came to forty-two bucks with tip.

Wife's burger was totally uncooked and raw throughout. 
Mine was ok, but the potato chips had the crunch factor of peanut brittle. Some may like that, I don't.

My wife got the shits around midnight. 
My shits came slightly sooner than hers...like when I saw the bill was thirty seven bucks.

I felt like Andy Dufresne walking bowlegged after a bout with 'The Girls', as I 'walked' out to the parking lot afterward.
No thanks, Lush Burger."}
{"text":"I'm reminded of the old aphorism \"a rising tide lifts all boats\".  Lush Burger is one of many valley joints that is capitalizing on the gourmet burger trend.  It's good but not memorable.  A decent neighborhood spot but not a \"destination\" restaurant.

The prices are a tad cheaper than the others in its category, but that is mainly due to the smaller portion sizes.  The burger field is just too crowded these days, I'm not sure that this stands out enough to become a fixture."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening and sat outside which it is a nice patio. Service was weird at first... came in and sign said \"please wait to seat yourself\"and the hostess was at the bar speaking with the bar tender and when a member of the staff brought us to her attention she didn't even turn around and just said \"have them seat themselves\" The waitress that then helped us made up for it. Service is not my complaint here nor is it with the actual restaurant... it's with the food. Ordered a Turkey burger and it tasted like it was frozen and not fresh. We also ordered the soft pretzels as a an app and it tasted like it was just thawed and thrown in a fryer. You can go to AJ's grille in the afternoon and get better tasting food for half the price. At the price point of their burgers I have had much better tasting food elsewhere. If you're a burger joint that doesn't advertise as fast food make your burgers daily and in house."}
{"text":"Buyer beware! 

I received their email for Sunday mimosas and bloody Mary's for $4. I had a friend in town for the holiday, so we decided to head over for a few drinks. The mimosas were 90% juice and a splash of champagne. I figured, for $4, whatever. My friend had 2 bloody Mary's. She said the first one was awful but thought maybe it was a fluke and ordered a second one. She said the second one was just as awful as the first and switched to beer. 
Then the bill came and we were charged $7 per drink. We asked our waitress about it and she said the $4 was \"for the mix\", the extra $3 was for the alcohol.   Um, what? There is no \"mix\" in a mimosa?!  

The wait staff was a bunch of kids standing around talking about the other patrons, the appetizers were burnt and the drinks are actually double the price than what was advertised. I will never, ever be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been having lunch here about once a month for about a year now. And I don't even live nearby. The portions are gigantic. I can never eat a whole burger. I highly recommend this place. And the owners are awesome!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday, won't be going back. Both burgers were ordered medium and we got very well done, the chips were way over done and I received the worst margarita I have ever tasted in my life. The hostess looked like a bored teen in dirty clothing and a bad attitude. There was lots of staff, but they all seemed to be behind the bar chatting with each other except one who did all the work and you could see was over-whelmed. Our waitress and the fries were the only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"I've been hearing rumblings of a new burger joint called LUSH in North Scottsdale and had two of the most important ingredients yesterday to warrant a visit; Hunger and time!  My trusty pal \"Mikey\" (she'll eat anything), and I jumped into the car and drove on over to Lush Burger located in DC Ranch Crossing (southeast corner of pima & legacy boulevard) 18251 north pima road, for what we call \"a Derty feed\").

The first thing I noticed on parking in front was that the patio set-up looked like any number of Scottsdale clubs with long, low couches and bright colors.  I wondered if this was a burger joint of just another place to \"be seen.\"  Walking inside you immediately come upon a fast-food style counter with LED TV style menu boards that are becoming the \"must have\" item for hip new eateries and a bubbly teen welcoming us to Lush.

After the above mentioned teen gave us the rundown on how things work at Lush (order with her, find a table and then everything becomes full service), we had a look at the menu. There were several burger offerings with \"chic\" names including the 'Money\" (Kobe beef of course, and should have been \"$$$\" instead of \"money\" at $12), and the \"infusion\" (a 100% Angus beef patty infused with green chile's and pepper jack cheese $10), and of course the obligatory potato offerings including 50/50 fries (half sweet potato and half regular) and their signature Truffle fries (chives, white truffle and parmesan).

I ordered the truffle fries, the Infusion burger (the \"chef\" suggests medium), and a Sonoran Draft root beer.  We found seats along the counter that were covered in black and white cowhide and waited for our food.  After a while, another bubbly staff member arrived with baskets of fries smelling vaguely of truffle, followed by tasty looking burgers.

The fries were hot, skinny and crisp which I love, but didn't really have the truffle flavor that I was looking for (okay, it was there but very faint and none of the staff seemed able to tell me what they used though I suspect truffle salt), a \"B\" then.  On to the object of this review, the Infusion.. . I applied a bit of the chipotle aioli, grabbed up my burger, took a bite and promptly got drenched with all of the juice running out of it, down my arms and splashing off of the plate.. While this definitely indicated that it wasn't a dry overcooked burger and I love a little mess with my meals, I thought this a tad much.

Let's talk taste.  The burger was juicy as I've said, and it had good taste and texture but I wasn't getting the flavor of the green chiles and the pepper jack that it was infused with was only vaguely present.  I would have to say it was about a 7 on a scale of 1-10.

The service was great with cute girls doting over us and eagerly supplying us with whatever we might need and the place is definitely worth a second visit (they are working out the kinks since they've only been open 24 days or so), but I would say this isn't my favorite burger joint (it's actually almost too nice to be referred to as a \"joint\").

One notable piece of the puzzle was the Sonoran Root beer on tap served in a properly chilled glass.  With just the rite amount of vanilla combined with smooth, creamy root beer goodness, this root beer (at $4/glass), was worth the trip by itself.  
Check them out on twitter.
Over-all, I give Lush Burger a 6 out of 10.  If your looking for a place to be seen, have a decent meal and chill, it's not a bad option but if your looking for a GREAT burger, you'll have to keep looking. (I happen to know where to find one)."}
{"text":"You'd think that a place with single burger meals starting at $8 for plain burgers would have great-tasting food, impeccable service and to-die-for decor. Not so at Lush Burger.

To be fair, the decor isn't that bad at the north Scottsdale restaurant and is probably the best thing about it, in fact. It's a funny thing to stand out, but I really like their all-white bathrooms and pretty hanging lights throughout the restaurant.

The cow print seats in the bar arear are a turn-off (I don't like to be reminded cows had to die for all those burgers), but I like the red-focused color scheme and the overall classiness of the hamburger joint. There's also a big patio with really nice flat-screen TV's.

The thing that has disappointed me the most about Lush Burger is the service. All three times I've been there, it has taken at least 20 minutes for my parties to get our food-even when the restaurant wasn't busy.

The first time I went, I requested a veggie patty on the Lushburger Classic ($8). I've never experienced any type of problem when making a request like this anywhere else that offered a veggie burger-if you have a veggie burger on the menu, you should be able to substitute that veggie patty on any other burger. The waitress at Lush, however, didn't understand this concept at all and said the only option available was to get a portobello mushroom burger, which wasn't listed on the menu but was vegan. It didn't come with the stuff I had wanted from the classic, like pickles, but it was fine. Still, having to add cheese for $1 and fries for $3 (none of the burgers come with fries) that resulted in an average-tasting lunch was disappointing.

I had a Farmers Market Salad ($8) next time I went. It came with lettuce, corn, artichoke, avocado, edamame, cucumber, carrots, tomato and jicama with a champagne vinaigrette. The salad parts were OK, but the dressing was bland and the meal was almost freezing cold.

The third time I went, I got the veggie burger I wanted the first time-funny how I should have been able to get that all along.

The quinoa and grilled squash patty did taste great, but it should be made with something that helps it stick together better, because the burger kept falling apart. The veggie burger usually comes bun-free because of this, and I really wish Lush had a better veggie patty option for people who want some of their other burger options without the dead cow.

While I can't comment on the meat burgers, I think it's pretty annoying Lush charges for fries. And since all my experiences there, both service- and food-wise, have been mediocre, I'm not rushing to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers

The food was great and I recommend the lettuce burger if you don't eat bread.  We thought you only got a burger, so asked the waitress what she would recommend for a side.  She said the fries, which we got. 

But, she neglected to tell us that it already came with fried potato slices (which were wonderful!).  So we ended up throwing out the fries.  She should have recommended the salad  (or something)."}
{"text":"A group of us went today after our sons hockey playoff hockey game at ice den. The weather was awesome so we sat on the patio. I had the slider trio with truffle fries. The truffle fries were great!!!! And the burger was really good too. Definitely   recommend the truffle fries."}
{"text":"Decided to go here with my girlfriend for a quick meal on 12/30/13. We had an appointment later on that afternoon so we told our waiter we were in a hurry.  

The ambiance is pretty nice, but the main problem was the cold attitude of the staff. We had to find our own menus behind the bar and were left unattended to for about 5 minutes after we sat down. All of the staff was attending to a mixed up food order of another gentleman sitting at the bar. We should have taken this as an omen. 

Anyway, we ordered two normal burgers, but veggie burger style instead. We also had carbonated waters. After about 20 minutes, and still no burgers, I had to ask for the check because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to deal with it later. We saw an errant $8.00 charge on the bill, and when we asked what it was for, the waiter said that we were getting a normal burger, with a veggie patty on top of the beef patty. I was dumbfounded- when you ask for one style of burger \"with a veggie burger instead\" I'd expect only a veggie party, not a veggie patty on top of a beef patty. Amazing. 

Anyway, he proceeded to fill our half empty carbonated water with normal still water as we were finishing up. Surprisingly, the food was actually really good once they fixed the order. Nice quinoa veggie patty, a soft brioche bun, and fresh ingredients. And great fries! 

Fix the service and it's a great lunch spot. Until then, avoid."}
{"text":"Gal Pal & I went for happy hour on Wednesday night and sat on the patio.  Our server was Sasha and she was VERY good and was over the top nice in taking care of all my special request... ie. extra ketchup, 3 more pickles please).  We ordered off the happy hour menu and both got the house cab to drink (it was surprisingly delish) and the sliders.  It should be noted that this is \"ONE\" slider (aka baby burger for $2) so you will really want to consider getting at least two. Our Turkey patty was not a patty but 1/4 cut of a regular size burger which I thought was a wee bit odd but it tasted good.  The sliders don't come with any \"extra's\" ... just the meat and the bun so we asked for lettuce, tomato & pickle.  We also ordered a little basket of fries too (1/2 regular & 1/2 sweet potato) which were good.    Overall we liked the food and loved the ambiance & our server.  Truly they don't come better than Sasha so hopefully the restaurant will hang on to her.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great burger my grandson said it was the best he's ever had.  Sweet potato fries great Service and venue the best"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Not rude or anything, just slow. I could barely taste my burger as it was about 1/4 the size of the bun. On top of that, it was way overcooked. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Another run of the mill burger joint. Mediocre but not bad. Difficult to figure out what the differentiating factor is. There is none!!! 
But if what you are looking for is a good burger, go to In N Out and at 50% of the price you will feel damn good. 
My Roadhouse burger was not very impressive. Big on size and quantity but small on flavor. 
The fries are sub-par and their is no redeeming quality to the cole slaw. 
I have been here many times and my comments reflect my multiple experiences here. 
Bottom line: not bad but nothing Lush about it."}
{"text":"Second time we went to this local establishment that does'nt cater to anyone.  We walked in at 9:17 with twelve people ish there and immediately were told by the friendly employee that they are closed, with the manager standing right behind her.  I'm not clear what school of hospitality these fine employees went to but if here are paying guests in the building why would you turn away people that willing to pay for the experience.  Thanks for an experience that is typical of your location and lack of attention to guests.

Update-went here for lunch the next day and had a great meal.  Service and food were great, thank you for a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  What prompted me to come in was the interview that I saw on the news.  Met the owner too.  Great guy, great place, making Scottsdale great again.  The food quality is superb and the service is excellent.  Huge portions, great atmosphere, and the patio is a perfect chill spot.  The prices are very reasonable considering the quality and quantity that you get.  Will be coming back here again soon.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a business meeting and I enjoyed my experience. I agree with some of the reviews that these guys are on the \"gourmet burger bandwagon\" and while my burger was not the greatest I've ever had on my forty years on this planet, I enjoyed it.

The service was friendly, if a little slow, and the atmosphere nice so even though I don't think I'd make the journey from Central Phoenix up here for a burger, I think everyone could do far worse."}
{"text":"Lush Burger used to be so bad it was not worth even one star which is why I never did a review. But they apparently are under new ownership and they seem to have made some significant improvements. 

Better beef in the burgers for sure and generally better service."}
{"text":"Our family(3kids) loves Lush Burger. Sweet potato fries are perfect. Tuna burger is personal fav. Delicious shakes. Love the hibiscus tea. Whatever earlier complaints previous reviews brought up seem to have been addressed. Always had attentive service. Burgers always cooked to perfection. Great ambiance and seating options. Fun specials. Worth fanning on FB!"}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in burgers, they need not have a lot of choices in the burger department.  I opted for the classic and added cheddar cheese and bacon and my fiancee ordered the infusion.  The menu states that all burgers are served \"medium\" but our entire table and the folks next to us received them well done.  We were all very hungry so decided just to eat it but the table next to us were less than thrilled.  The infusion burger was actually pretty decent but my classic was on the bland side.  The best part of the burger were the brioche buns but I was still expecting the overall burger to be better.  We also ordered the sweet potato and truffle fries which were the highlight of the meal.  Maybe it was an off night, who knows but if you want a good burger go to Zin Burger or Indulge Burger (this is merely a copy cat that comes up way short).  On the upside, the service was attentive and very friendly.  With so many better burger restaurants, I would not choose to go back."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  The burger and fries were pretty good.  Plenty of TVs in the bar area.  Service can be a little lacking at times."}
{"text":"Before the recent ownership change it was great. The food and service was very good and the prices were reasonable. Not any more. New ownership has jacked up the prices, service is poor and food is fair. My wife ordered a turkey burger and they were out of the buns served with it so she told the waiter to just do a lettuce wrap and they charged her half a buck extra. That is just plain stupid. They also were almost empty on a Sunday night when they used to be very busy at the time we went.Never again."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times and my husband really likes it.   There is a long list of burgers to choose from and the ones we have tried have been good.   I've also had the Chinese Chicken Salad which is ok but overpriced considering the size and the ingredients.    It's convenient for us and typically fairly quick (good if we are pressed for time)."}
{"text":"Popped in for a \"quick\" bite. Was seated rather promptly. Water came quickly. I should have mentioned to the server that I was in a hurry, but I didn't think I had to since the place was virtually empty at noon (that should have been my first clue). Took about 3 minutes to decide. Put my menu down and started looking at my phone to signal I'm ready. Apparently, server didn't pay attention to detail. She dropped off something at the table next to mine and walked right back to the bar without so much as a glance my way. I waited another few minutes but she was too busy talking to a fellow coworker behind the bar. Never got to taste the food. Got up and left. I predict this place won't last that much longer if management doesn't start fixing the problems that are driving foodies like me away. I eat out quite a bit and enjoy a good burger once in a while. I guess they feel they have enough customers."}
{"text":"I took out an order of their pesto chicken sandwich and it was totally inedible.  The chicken was literally like a piece of rubber- impossible to even take a bite or chew.  Worst chicken sandwich I have ever tried to eat.  This was my first time getting food from here and will likely be my last."}
{"text":"Meh I've had better.. Sliders were dry, salad was dry, chicken sandwich was good. Happy hour lasts until 7 which is nice!"}
{"text":"I Frequent this place. The folks are great and the menu even better.  Had the featured Jack Burger tonight and it was fantastic !!"}
{"text":"I brought my friends with me to Lush Burger to try it out.  This restaurant is exactly what this neighborhood needs.  It has an amazing chef that helped create a delicious menu and a friendly staff to help with whatever the customer desires.  It has awesome black and red booth decor inside and a large size patio with comfy sitting arrangements outside.  You order the food at the register, receive a number, and your food is ran out to you.  This place is friendly, efficient and running pretty smoothly for being open since May 4th.  It turned out to be a very kid and family friendly environment with a little something for everyone. They have an inexpensive beer and wine selection for adults and wiki stiks and goldfish to keep children occupied.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone of any age because it is a very laid back environment where the guest is always taken care of and an incredible menu with a little something for everyone. What more can you ask for?
Go and check out lush burger today!"}
{"text":"Save yourself $20 a person and cook your own freezer food. I got the crab cake trio burger and it was totally flavorless. I would confidently bet that they use freezer patties and the King Hawaiians rolls you can buy at Safeway for two dollars with a single slice of avocado and the coleslaw (after I said no coleslaw). Came with chips that also had no flavor.

 My boyfriend got the pizza burger and it also had no flavor. So like I said, overall no flavor at all. Don't bother trying this place."}
{"text":"We really like the burgers and fries we've gotten here! Both times we were not disappointed. Also, on Sunday's they have $6 bottomless mimosas that don't disappoint. The one reason it is 3 not 4/5 starts is service. First time we had good service! Really nice waitress. Second time we walked in and could clearly see employees smoking/vaping outside before we were seated then had super slow service on what looked like a very slow day. BUT o think it's possible to have an off day with servers. Food was great!"}

Yelp review
Lush Burger 
18251 N Pima Rd Scottsdale, AZ 85255 (480) 686-8908

I eat out a lot and love to try new restaurants every single time. Lush Burger is a place that I continue to go back to because of their service and great food. I love BBQ burgers and I have had quite a bit. The ambience is amazing and the servers are beyond nice. They greet you with a genuine smile from the door and do anything to make the customer happy. The menus has a wide array of choices and plenty of food for anyone to enjoy. Lush burger is located in the heart of D.C. Ranch in North Scottsdale. 

Let us start at the beginning:
The restaurant is very easy to find right off of the 101 freeway. It is very easy to see because of the bright red signs and red decore. The booths are very comfortable and ridiculously spacious. We were sat right away. They have a simple menu with a lot of great food. They have a large selection of alcoholic beverages as well. My favorite of the 10 appetizers are the wings. They are cooked to order and are amazing. The soft pretzels are to die for as well. The wings were brought out within 10 minutes with the perfect temperature. 

When we were sat, we were greeted with a bright smiling face. She asked us what we wanted to drink and that if we needed a few minutes to make some decisions. We told her we needed a few minutes and she gave us that. After a few minutes, we ordered a BBQ burger with sweet potato fries (which they are famous for) and a ahi tuna salad. We watched many of the tv's that they have while we waited. About 10 minutes later, we got our food. It was delicious to say the least. The burger was cooked to perfection and the bun was perfectly crispy. The fries were amazing as usual. The ahi tuna salad was a piece of art. It was decorated with greens and perfect pieces of ahi tuna. Once we finished our meals, we were asked by our server if we want dessert. I couldn't leave without the Oreo malt, so we ordered two of them. They were amazing and hit the spot. Last but not least we got the check. It was nowhere near being expensive. Lush Burger sends out coupons for $6.99 burgers, so of course I used it. This place is the best bang for your buck. Our bill was very low and our stomach's were very full. I do not have any complaints for Lush Burger. The only thing that I would say they need to work on is branching out. They need to open up more around scottsdale because I believe that they are the best burgers around town. They are very cost effective they know what they are doing. I give Lush Burger 5 out of 5 stars. Definitely go to this restaurant if you can because it is amazing! The service and food is impeccable! [518 wds.]"}
{"text":"Love the burgers, the wings, the happy hour and the staff. Erin and her crew are great,  always nice, good atmosphere.  plus they love to support my animal rescue! !!"}
{"text":"Oh lush burger, I really wanted to like you. You had great happy hour specials, really awesome and friendly/ helpful servers, and tasty drinks (going off my friends on that one bc i just had a soda). The restaurant itself was also set up really nicely with really cool booths outside. I really enjoyed the ambience.

But your food was bad. Really bad. We tried burgers, wings, fries (aka the happy hour menu), and my stomach was literally churning by the end of the meal. 

I felt sick for the remaining hours of the evening until I went to bed. 

#hire new chefs

I predict this place won't last."}
{"text":"Been once - really good - had the Hangover burger.  Chocolate shake very good as well."}
{"text":"OMG people! I have been here for Happy hour before,  but lunch time is better!   If you're craving a burger, lush your mouth with the hangover burger"}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant on a tv show called Check Please Arizona I drove out to scottsdale to try. When arriving we put our name on a waiting list and the hostess told us the wait was 30 minutes but then told us it could be 45 minutes, an hour, or even longer. She was very rude and showed no care for the people waiting. I tried the Lushburger Infusion and it was an average burger with very little taste from the roasted chiles and the chipotle sauce was just ok. My wife had the Lushburger Classic and said it was a good burger but she has had better. We also ordered the truffle fries that had very little taste. This restaurant has a large patio but limited indoor seating. They are so limited on indoor seating that the waiting area is outside the main entrance to the restaurant. So if going to restaurant in the summer it will be very uncomfortable to wait ."}
{"text":"Went there tonight, service was horrible, appetizers didn't come before food and we had to remind her to take it off since they never came. Food was average. Last time going there, we used to love it"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Burgers rule !!!  Great, trendy atmosphere.  This place is fantastic both for kids, as well as at the bar if that's more your thing.  Get the hangover burger on brioche.  Order medium rare to make sure it's cooked to perfection !!  The biggest issue is that the service is average.  To you who expect instant burgers, this is not supposed to be fast food, so don't expect drive-thru fast.  If you want that go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is a favorite! The salads and burgers are fantastic, and the kids meals make my child happy... The staff is always accommodating, especially tonight when River was our server... This is a fun place to eat outside in Arizona, to be around a very fun personable cast of staff and enjoy a nice drink and delicious food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I have been to Lush burger twice in the last two years.

Lush burger doesn't suck, but the burgers were underwhelming by every stretch of the imagination. Far better than anything you would get at a fast food joint, but as far as the very crowded craft-burger genre goes, there are just better options. 

The service was not bad either, a better word is awkward. The servers just seemed like they didn't know what to do with conversation with their tables.

My advice: Train your staff on a tiny bit of hospitality so they seem a little more genuine and less awkward, and also maybe think about trying some unique, or a little outside the box ideas with your menu. Experiment. Try new things often and axe the ones that don't sell and have your servers casually ask for feedback from the people who order them.

Overall if there is one word that summarizes the two times i came here is \"forgettable\" ... and unless you stand out above the rest, which they don't, then i will likely forget it exists next time i am trying to decide where to eat."}
{"text":"We first moved to the Valley a little over a year ago and stumbled upon Lush Burger one day. The food was REALLY good and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We went back a few times over the year and found each time pretty good. 
Then, life got busy and we didn't go back again until the other night. We were so excited to go back to Lush Burger because of our prior experiences and we were happy to see that it wasn't terribly busy when we arrived. 
We were quickly seated and not given a menu. Figured that was ok...we would get one soon. We waited 15 minutes and after finally flagging our server down (we tried to get others attention, but were told they would get our server), we weren't even greeted. We were asked \"Do you know what you want?\" Ummmm...we didn't even have menus, so not really. We asked for menus and drinks and she returned 10 minutes later with the menus. Drinks came later.
Again, we just wrote it off as maybe she had a busy section. She returned a few minutes later and took our order. We ordered apps and entrees at the same time and asked for the apps to come out first. 
We waited...and waited...and waited...40 minutes passed and finally a side salad that I had ordered instead of potatoes came out. 15 minutes later, our apps came out. Within 5 minutes of the apps coming out, our food came out and sadly, it was cold. Our glasses sat empty for over 45 minutes and when we tried to ask others for refills, we were told they would tell our server. I am not sure the message ever made it to her. 
Needless to say, it was not a pleasant experience, especially from a favorite restaurant that was not very busy. 
My husband quietly spoke with the manager about the situation so as not to draw too much attention. She apologized and comped a portion of our meal which we appreciated. But what I found most concerning was she asked me to give a good review on Yelp. I found that request shocking. Additionally, as she was coming out to bring us our revised check, she stopped to watch the World Series. I understand it is the World Series and yes, we enjoy watching the game too, but as a customer who just brought to your attention the sad state of service, we would expect to be a priority. 
Overall, it was a bad experience...one I hope to not repeat. Lush Burger had quality food and good service. I am not sure what has happened, but I hope our most recent experience is just an aberration rather than a new standard. For that reason, I give the restaurant 3 stars instead of 2 stars. If we return (and that's a BIG \"if\"), I hope to increase their rating. Fingers crossed.

As a recommendation to the restaurant:
- Don't overburden your servers.
- Have someone circle for beverage refills.
- Communicate. Communicate. Communicate. If the kitchen is backed up, let the customer know. Don't just disappear. Customers understand when you keep them informed. 
- If a customer raises a concern, don't make a joke of it.
- Focus on the customer. Check on your customers. 
- Don't ask your customers to write a good review on Yelp after a negative experience just because you comped part of the meal."}
{"text":"I must admit I haven't been here since the new owners took over more than a year ago. The burger and fries were excellent and the bartender, manager Sammy was very personable and professional. If you were at all apprehensive about giving them a try. DO!! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today! Took over 30 minutes to receive our burgers! Ordered the Philly Burger with Cheez Whiz, still looking for the Whiz! No where to be found. Can only have the burgers medium which of course came medium welll! Asked for no onions, lo and behold onions on the burgers. Did refill our drinks without us asking! Probably to appease us for the very long wait. Extras for $1.00 mushrooms, ordered came with a portabella which was not stated. Did not take the $1.00 off the check. This was reflected in the tip we left. Not going back here EVER."}
{"text":"**BREAKING NEWS!**
Lush has new owners! 
I went for my weekly patio lunch date (My server was Brent, whom is ALWAYS a doll...request him!) and I found out that DC's gem is undergoing changes! 
I met Kevin, one of the new owners - even though he was SWAMPED, he still look time to come  by my table and speak with me!
I am very excited to see what changes Lush will be making; all of which I am sure will be amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered lush from grub hub and lush burger  got 2 out of 2 burger orders wrong and I called grub hub customer service and he was very nice and helpful, he got lush to refund 1 burger only and gave us a credit for our next order but we still had to pay for 35 dollars of a wrong order. I am gluten free and they sent my burger with a bun in it so I couldn't even eat lunch and they also messed up my husbands burger we asked for no sauce pickle or tomato and bbq sauce on the side and we got no sauce on the side and there were pickles and tomato and house sauce on the burger. So even though both orders were wrong and grub hub said it was at fault of lush burger they still wouldn't refund our order. We then called lush directly and they continued to deny our refund and were very rude. I won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"The infusion burger is all you need to know. The signature dish! Great staff, they really pay attention to your dining experience. Awesome happy hour, Sunday football is perfect. Sound for the game you're watching if you need it."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes away and have frequented Lush Burger a lot.  Prices are a little high, but they send out coupons that make the place a good value.  Use to really like the place but ever since they got Chuck, new manager (chubby guy behind the bar), the place has gone down hill.  He is so rude that I'm not coming anymore, bringing friends or relatives.  He does not honor the monthly internet coupons.  Said I was there a few weeks ago with a coupon (they are emailed monthly) so he wouldn't honor it.  He should be fired.  Don't send out coupons if you're not going to honor them!  Anyway, if you must go- skip the Ahi Tuna salad.  Hit or miss.  Use to love it but then got a bad order,  its raw tuna and was really tough.  When I told him, he admitted that sometimes it comes in like that but that they can't just throw it out since it costs money.  Seriously.  You serve bad tuna even when you know its bad.   Rotten customer service.  Owner should know how bad he is.  No longer a customer!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger I've eaten in ... let's just say Ever. $20 for a meal and drink and EXCELLENT SERVICE! The owners were there and made sure everything was good. The place looks amazing! I've found my new burger joint ! Oh yea! Huge fan of the fries! Great place"}
{"text":"Loved the burgers. Had the turkey Cobb and it was amazing. The wine selection was decent. We shared a bottle of Cabernet and it went down easy. The sweet potato fries were a treat. Ambiance was also great."}
{"text":"Super yummy burgers, crispy and not greasy chips, great service! We'll definitely be back to sit on the patio and enjoy some yummy eats!"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved coming to this restaurant. Came on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. I really enjoyed the food (I got the chicken mahalo sandwich). I do know they are known for their selection of burgers and pizzas and homemade chips! Marked down one star because the service was sort of slow. Decently priced for a Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend suggested Lush Burger after seeing it mentioned on \"Check Please\" and although there were many unfavorable reviews we headed out to see for ourselves.  Got there around 11:30 and walked in with no one there to greet customers.  I did notice the sign that says \"please wait to be seated\" was turned around and the podium was also pushed in a corner.  Someone behind the bar did finally acknowledge us and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Daryn was our server and she was very friendly.  Drinks were served immediately.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it did take a bit before we got it but it was very tasty and the two dipping sauces were excellent. All three of us ordered burgers.  Two were the Philly and one the Bella Angus and we all requested medium well.  Two of us ordered the fries ($2 extra) and the other stayed with the standard chips.  The burgers arrived within a reasonable time just as we were finishing the calamari which was perfect.  One of the burgers was still very pink in the middle and unfortunately my friend that got that one hates pink or red meat but opted NOT to send it back but did tell Daryn afterwards that the meat was not cooked to order.  She said she would pass it on to the cook.  My other friends burger was cooked perfectly.  Mine was a mixture of some pink and some well done.  The chips were very good and crisp.  One portion of fries were very nice.  My portion were the bits and pieces of what could be the leftovers at the bottom of the bag as most were only one to less than one inch long.  Some were crisp and some limp.  We all agreed the meat itself had no flavor even with the cheese, onions, mushrooms and all the other condiments that came with them.  We also noted that the bottom of the burger bun was cold only to find out all three of our plates were actually cold!  What restaurant serves hot food on cold plates?

The staff seemed to be efficient but they were REALLY young and looking into the kitchen when the doors would swing open so were the cooks which is obviously the reason for the food flaws as there is no professional chef on board.  We will definitely not return to this restaurant as there are many other burger places out there that serve a tastier burger."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Julianna took amazing care of my fiancé and I. Her bubbly and outgoing personality definitely made our experience even better! We can't  wait to come back just to see her again and eat the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the overall 3 star rating.  The food and service at Lush Burger is solid."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! My work out studio is in the same shopping center, so I smell the deliciousness every time I get out of a workout (unfair, right?). So the hubs, stepson, and I ventured over last Friday evening. They have a nice outdoor patio area with misters..we almost decided to sit out there, but there was one table left inside so we decided on that instead. I'd love to come back here in the cooler months to sit outside and have a couple of cocktail and a burger.

First off, we ordered the Hell Fire Potato Chips - house made chips drizzled with hot sauce and crumbled bleu cheese. O. M. G. They were crazy good! We wanted MORE hot sauce on them because it was so addicting! We ended up ordering a side of it later on for our fries LOL.

My husband and I split the Lushburger Infusion - beef infused with green chilies & pepper jack cheese w/ a chipotle spread. If you've read my other reviews, you know we like our food spicy, so I had high hopes for this one. It wasn't AS spicy as I would've like it. I couldn't really taste much spice at all, unfortunately. However, the burger was cooked well and the bun was on par, so I was happy. My stepson ordered the Western Burger w/ bacon and BBQ sauce and he seemed to devour it, so I'm gonna assume it was good. 

There were a couple of mistakes made with our orders, but our server was more than accommodating. Great service overall. The 80's music they were playing was a bit much. By the end of the meal, I was over it. A little variety might be good, guys...just sayin.

My guys also ordered milkshakes; I was too full to order my own, but I did taste theirs. The Mr. Lushbar (peanut butter and chocolate) tasted like straight peanut butter. I like peanut butter, but not to that extent. The Chocolate Thin Mint was good. It tasted like it had peppermint extract instead of that weird mint flavor I normally taste in, like, mint chocolate chip ice cream. 

I signed up for their Lush Club and got a free burger! Have to redeem by Sunday, so I better get there quick!"}
{"text":"I am going to have to give them a second go, like in a month....  (They did just open on the 4th).

They have a LOT of kinks to work out still!  Maybe their system needs to be revised... You stand in line, order, take a #, seat yourself.  Simple system...?  Well, yes, but no.  The line goes through the middle of the restaurant and so servers have to walk through to pick up drinks, not so okay when busy.  Then the poor servers are running around the entire restaurant lost trying to find your number.  I think this restaurant may be a little too big for such a system?  I recommend you sit right at the table in front of the kitchen doors, at least you'll get warm food ;-)

Burgers range $8, $10, $12 (turkey $9)...  Sides are additional $3, $4, $5  Cheese is $1 Bacon or Avocado $2.  They do have shakes/floats, which I was going to get one until I saw beer on tap, so I got a blue moon.  If I remember correctly they had about five beers on tap...?  And, I believe they offer wine & champagne (I never saw a menu with alcohol).

What we got: lush burger infusion (pepperjack cheese green chilies chipotle aioli), grilled chicken sandwich(corn&sweet pepper relish), truffle fries and 2 blue moons ($41 before tip - kind of an expensive lunch).  Everything was, eh.......'okay'.  I really liked the fries!  Like I said, I will give them another try after they've been open for a little longer :-)

The decor is pretty cool AND the bathroom decor!!!  (The men's and women's decor is different, check out both)."}
{"text":"Recent new ownership and this former favorite of ours has
spiraled downhill very quickly. Quality of food and service has
deteriorated rapidly. In addition they no longer accept coupons
which have been in use for years. Tough to imagine how they
quickly could have turned this place into an overpriced rip off. 
Go to McDonald's next door for a better meal (: Other night the
place was empty and it will probably go the way of recently
closed Decantur across the street. !!"}
{"text":"I usually hate hamburgers. But I was pleased with the classic Lush burger! It was 8 dollars for the homemade chips and a hamburger. The bun was amazing, the meat cooked (medium rare) perfectly. I would recommend this place to anyone going on a casual date or hanging out with friends. I don't see children there but ok sure, it's kid friendly."}
{"text":"Went back last night with my brother, place was dead on a Saturday night at 7:30. The burger was terrible, money would have been better spent at McDonalds or I could have had a better burger for free at my university's dining hall (I hate their burgers). I see Lush Burger going out of business within 3 months, they just have lowered their quality and it is not good anymore."}
{"text":"Definitely didn't wow us - ordered my burger sans bun and mayo and while they eliminated the bun, the lettuce was bathed in garlicky mayo. My daughter's coconut shrimp were luke warm and tasted like they had been frozen a bit too long. Even getting a drink refill (of water) seemed to be too much to ask.
Reading the menu was the best part of the visit - really funny and creative. Kudos to the author!"}
{"text":"I see no recent reviews from here. 
I ordered a strawberry margarita which tasted decent. Then we ordered 3 kids meals; two mac& cheese and one cheese sliders. I ordered the ahi tuna burger with sweet potato fries. The fries taste pretty good, kinda skinny, come with spicy thousand island for dipping. The burger itself was very drippy but the patty itself was very dry and tasteless. I ate about half and when the waitress came by I told her and she said she would comp my meal.  I went to wash my hands and I noticed the soap dispenser was empty and the trashcan was full. My boys went to use the bathroom and he came back to tell me the toilet paper was empty in the mens bathroom. Hmmmm. Theres no excuse since its 4:30. Not during the lunch or dinner rush. 
The staff were attentive and the restaurant was otherwise clean. Im not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love Lush Burger, the staff is always super welcoming and friendly. Plus the food and drinks are always amazing! Good prices too!!"}
{"text":"Lush burger could be something great, but the details aren't quite there to make it so.  Everything looks good, from the décor to the menu, but be careful with some of the wobbly bar stools.  Drinks are decent and the bartender Dane is great.  He is very attentive, friendly, and genuinely nice.  He is the only reason this place gets a 3rd star.  The food sounds good on the menu and looks decent when it arrives.  But the taste and quality seem to vary significantly each time I have gone, and recently the quality hasn't been great.  Wings are good some times, incredibly dry other time.  Burgers are hit or miss, but should be better for the price.  Hopefully the new ownership gets it back on track and helps this place active like a real burger joint."}
{"text":"Every single time I eat at lush I keep hoping it'll be better, Nooooope. Drinks are well priced during happy hour, other than that - no."}
{"text":"Says on Yelp open till 10pm. Stood at the front door for over 5 mins to have someone come out and tell us they closed the kitchen down at 9pm tonight. It was 9:05!!  Won't be returning again. Too many other businesses in the area. Not cool."}
{"text":"Very trendy place. Had the lush burger abd the truffle fries. Wasn't too happy with the truffle fries. The parmesan cheese wasn't blended in with the fries like i thought. Overall the burger was good and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok, so I went to Lush when they first opened and was completely unimpressed!  Tonight was my first time back.  I wasn't expecting much but didn't want to drive farther than my own neighborhood.  I ordered the Ahi Salad & was pleasantly surprised.  The kids had the giant burgers and almost finished them.  The atmosphere was really great on the patio & the weather was perfect!  Service was perfect!  Very cool that they turned this place around.  Jack, the awesome bus boy, said the menu just changed, and apparently for the (much) better!  The burgers are a little pricey at $12, but we were told there are usually coupons in the mail or offers through the mailing list for $6 burgers!  Give it a try & let's keep this much needed neighborhood place alive!"}
{"text":"Lush is not what I would describe their burgers or service. This place has mediocre food and terrible service.

My husband and I stopped here for a lunch date and noticed they had a lunch special for the lushburger classic with fries and a drink. Both of us ordered our burgers medium rare. The actual burger patty was less than half an inch thick and came out well done -like a drive-thru burger from McDonald's or similar. The bun was flavorless and the fries were meh. Overall, the meal was not impressive and very bland. 

I told myself I didn't want to come back but somehow my husband talked me into going here again. The second time we stopped in for lunch and the place looked over half empty and really slow. Standing by the hostess stand area was another patron waiting to be seated, so we stood behind her waiting for the hostess or a waitress to seat us or even acknowledge us. So, we waited. And we waited. We waited for 15 or so minutes. There was absolutely no eye contact from any of the staff and there was plenty of staff wandering around. No verbal \"be with you in a few\", no eye contact, and no one even came anywhere near us. We were avoided like the plague. Unable to even flag someone down, we left and haven't been back."}
{"text":"I kind of see what others are talking about when it came to Lush.  The decor and atmosphere were very trendy but the place is lacking in the fundamentals!  For instance, the patio door is left open, which wouldn't be an issue except for no pest aka fly control.  And the place had plenty of flies around.  As a result, I decided to do the bathroom check because you can always tell the cleanliness of a spot by how they manage the bathrooms and to be honest they weren't that bad but not up to par by my standards.

The wait staff was attentive, nothing to brag about.  The food was good as well but nothing to brag about either.  What I will mention is their milkshakes, I ordered the Oreo and it was amazingly refreshing and the perfect mix of ice cream to milk to Oreo ratio!  Other than that, I don't think I'd be stopping by any time I find my self back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I know this place is under new management so we decided to try it out as it is close and i have always been a fan of the truffle fries and chipotle mayo. I was a little bit surprised as I feel like the quality of food has dropped. I don't know if they are getting their food from a new supplier, but it was not like how I remembered Lush previously. I have been living less than a mile away from Lush for almost 9 years, and hope that the new owners can spruce it up a bit from the food side. I am looking forward to seeing what they do this year with the food selection and quality."}
{"text":"Lushburger is so named because 'lush' is British slang for attractive. And that's the perfect name for this place. Not only are the customers extremely beautiful but, amazingly, the burgers are even more so.

{"text":"Great burgers!! 
Try the New Yawka!
Good service  
Their wings are a hidden gem
Good selection of beers"}
{"text":"My picks:
Moose Drool
Sweet 'n Salty Mix Fries
Baby Lush Burger Trio
Delushious Cookie Pie

Trendy, and little expensive .... but good.  The service was great and the manager created some special sliders for me loaded with toppings (pepper jack cheese, green chilies, avocados and mushrooms).  Yum!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and never saw anyone after our food was delivered til way after we were finished and sitting there with empty plates and glasses. The server's cell phone kept ringing while we were ordering. I did, however, enjoy the food....burger was very good and my son had their pizza which was not bad for Arizona pizza (it was no Jersey or NY pizza). Service left a LOT to be desired though..."}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant with an expansive menu. It seems like the menu was just redone so we will have to go back and try everything out!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, I guess if you want a cocktail with your meal then okay.  Telling you this for $5 across at AJ's 10x better burgers.  Will drive a couple miles down the road to either go to Cheeseburger and Beer or Four Peaks brewery such a better burger and price point.  ****Very bad thing new ownership and no food items on happy hour, not smart.  Price Price Price, way overpriced place, no food happy hour, shocking.*** Will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"Heard this place was under new ownership with a new menu, came to try out the new menu.  This place needs Spike TV's Bar Rescue if they want to stay open.  Service is absolutely terrible, 3 customers and 5 employees at once and they can't even keep up with there customers.  9 minutes for a glass of water then they forget to ask me what type of meat I want on my food until 7 minutes after I order which means they hadn't rang it in.  Nachos were ice cold they felt like the victims of the titanic."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day with my husband. He absolutely loved his infused burger.....said it would definitely be one of the best burgers he has ever had! I tried the sliders.....they were ok.....but to be fair due to being pregnant I have to order everything well done.....and I am sure they would have tasted better if they were done to my usual liking of medium. The truffle fries however were devine! My husband also tried an unusual drink called a Milk Stout Float.... I think that is what it was called. He seemed to know what he was ordering.....very confident......when it arrived I was surprised to find out it was ice cream in beer......I asked him how often he has had these... he said never! lol ...... He really enjoyed it though....so it ended well. The staff are great....friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is very nice....retro modern. The patio area also looks great (when it cools down!)."}
{"text":"Stay away. You would think that a place that specializes in burgers would know how to cook them to order. The only thing they know how to do is well done. You could literally write on the sidewalk with the pieces of charcoal they served. One burger went back twice, trying to get medium rare, but three times and it was still well done. 

The service poor too but I'm not going into that."}
{"text":"This place is ok...just ok.  They have a great looking menu, the decor is nice and the patio is great. Our waitress was nice enough but a bit inattentive. As for the food. We had the calamari which was \"meh\". My husband had the Lush Infusion burger which fell flat, needed salt and came with a tomato that tasted like nothing! I had the crab cake sliders which tasted fine but felt like it had come out of the freezer bag and been dumped in the fryer. Usually I don't mind that sort of thing but for the money I selfishly expect a bit more. Overall if you are in the area and are hungry you will have a fine enough meal here. But that will be it, just fine."}
{"text":"First time in and everything was excellent!! Great accommodating staff and food was fantastic! Patio is relaxing, great for all kinds of gatherings. Was greeted by the GM and owner, they made sure our time here was everything we expected and more! 

Thanks lush burger we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!.  We went just this last week on my wife's birthday for lunch.  She got a free beer as a gift!  She really loves their Ahi Tuna burger.  We've been many times for both lunches and dinners.  My brother-in-law and I share the Cookie Pie dessert if we are there for dinner :-)."}
{"text":"The food here is good and fun since it's a little over the top for burgers. They have a full bar and outdoor lounge seating also. The kids serving were all upbeat and eager to please. The only problem, I think, is the management. When you order messy wings and yummy gooey burgers you should not have to ask for napkins and silverware after the food has come. Train these kids! For the good of us, them, you and the burger world!"}
{"text":"I've been in Scottsdale for 2 weeks, leaving tomorrow and am so mad I just found this place tonight. I had their burger with green chilies, jack cheese and the most amazing sauce. Great homemade chips too. My husband had onion rings on his and he loved it also."}
{"text":"it is just OK.  Lush is expensive and has a differnt ordering platform, I am not sure if I like that.  The sweet potato fries are good, and the Burgers are good.  I guess I was just hoping a little bit more from this ultra modern burger joint."}
{"text":"Popped in after a fitness class to hang out with a friend to catch up and just girl chat.  First off the service was amazing!  I own a consulting firm that specializes in educating businesses (in the cosmetic medical field) in customer service, so I preach it day in and day out.  Jon H was our server (I think he was also the bartender) and he certainly had the customer service down!  Food was GREAT, and we didn't go 3 seconds with an empty glass.  I am not much of a burger girl, but there are so many other offerings (including the most addicting homemade kettle chips!)...  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Another 5 star outing at Lush Burger.   Again, sat out on the patio, and what a beautiful Arizona night it was.  Something about the DC Ranch area just makes everything right.  Salad and a burger as usual.  And once again, phenomenal!  Our Server was top notch too.  Ask for John!  We will be back 4 sure.....Next time, I think I will go there just for desert.  Those Mr. Lushbar shakes look to die for, but can never squeeze one in after such a great meal."}
{"text":"The place is decorated nicely, the hibiscus iced tea is wonderful and the wait staff are attentive and friendly.

Unfortunately, the food is overpriced, the buns are really dry, and basically it felt like a pretentious version of Blu Burger Grille."}
{"text":"Very good wine list! Great many foodie options. Great service by Ashley and observed the same by the rest of the staff who were all quite attentive. One of the servers or runners even took drink orders before their assigned server became available. Nice teamwork! The veggie burger was creative and delicious. And the ahi appetizer was just as good. Can't wait to come back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"There is one awesome thing about Lush Burger and many many average or just ok things. First the awesome thing. They are kid  friendly and have Wikki Stix instead of boring old crayons. Ask my nephew how much fun he had. And the shakes are double yum! 

I got the classic burger which looked over cooked at first...but the inside was medium just like I ordered it. Food came out fast! So fast it made me wonder how they did that. It was an ok burger. Chips were good. 

Service was good too. But I laugh at the reviews about the lack of customer service. Having lived in both Scottsdale and the west side....you will always get better service from young people, as a general rule, in the west side. It would take a sociologist to figure out why.

All in all we enjoyed Lush Burger and will be back! Wikki Stix are awesome!"}
{"text":"The concept is good, the execution is lacking. This is a nice 'upscale' burger place with nice atmosphere. The problem is they are serving basic burger quality at fancy burger prices. Regardless of the burger you order, the huge bun overpowers the limited volume of internal ingredients. Making a burger look big by using a huge bun doesn't overcome the disappointment of quantity and it negatively impacts the quality. The same can be said for the chicken burger which is a tiny breast of chick inside a mammoth bun and little else. Paying $14 for a burger with potato chips (fries extra) has quality and quantity expectations that Lush Burger falls well short on."}
{"text":"Update!

I did finally go back last week, and BIG improvement.

I ordered the sliders, and they were so huge, that if they're sliding down anyone's throat, you have a new calling as a porn star.  I ordered them medium rare, expecting them to be overcooked, and they were not.  They were cooked exactly to temperature.  Came with a plate of homemade chips )thick, waffle kind), which was lovely, as I remember last time, you had to order fries separately, and there were no comp chips.  

Back to the burger - it was juicy, thick, hand-formed, tasty, well-seasoned and hot.  When I bit into it (alas, I can't slide it), juice ran down my arm into the waiting plate.  That's burger bliss, people.

My only complaint is that we paid using our AAA discount card, which was supposed to be for 20%, and we were only given a 15% discount.  OK, not a huge impact in the grand scheme of life, but I like things to be fair.

Overall, just happy to see they learned how to season the burgers, and serve them properly.  Yipee!"}
{"text":"One of the better burgers around, and one of the most expensive. Trendy atmosphere, large screens to watch sports. Not that many booths inside but they have plenty of tables on the patio. Pretty good margaritas."}
{"text":"5 Stars hands down.  Service, food and attention to detail from our waiter made me a happy customer.  This place is a gem in north Scottsdale and if you find yourself in the area craving a burger do not think twice to consider stopping here.  

The fire chips were amazing as an appetizer and the burger was well made.  Cooked to my liking and prepared in time for my taste buds.  The blue moon I ordered on tap was a bit flat, but that wasn't a problem for our waiter to quickly switch out the kegs and bring me a new pint from the tap.  I know I'll be coming back for more of the menu.  I ended the dinner with a peanut butter shake and it didn't disappoint at all.  Great place, great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"So I happened to stumble across this place while working in the area today. I have to say, I love the decor, food, and staff. I love the fact that even though they don't normally serve coffee, they made me one anyway! For lunch I had the Lush Infusion, which was worth every penny. Caution: bring some napkins for that bad boy. Stop in and see Bree (Bri? Brei?) eh either way go see her. She has an infectious smile that will make your day. Next time I'll bring my boots to fit in with the cowhide decor as well!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite comfort food meals is a big greasy burger with lots of cheese, and of course onion rings.  Not too many places in this part of town can deliver on that - actually, that's an understatement - I couldn't find anyplace in NoSco that could deliver on that meal except Lush.  They did a great job with great service in upscale decor worthy of NoSco."}
{"text":"I was blown away by this place on opening weekend.  I haven't been back, but the Kobe burger my guest and I had was amazing.  Both of us couldn't believe how flavorful it was or how great the patio was.  

Cool concept - outdoor seating that huge and has many different areas and tables to sit at, along with tvs.  Pei Wei concept of ordering food and having it delivered to your table.  The manager personally came over and asked us how our food was and given how busy it was, I couldn't believe he took the time to do that.  

We had a great experience here with the patio and the food, I will definitely recommend to friends and go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food all around(burgers, pizza, salads, everything!). The staff is fantastic as well-Nick, Erin, and Chuck are awesome (just to name a few :)). Their happy hour is great and it's a great place to relax. Also on Sunday's they have a mobile unit for games for the kids."}
{"text":"Lush Burger is one of the many upscale hamburger chains that have flourished in the past few years, and it doesn't stand out from the crowd.  Basically you get a small variety of hamburger choices, a few salads, and a selection of pizzas (?).  They serve beer and wine, again small selections.

The burgers were prepared properly and had decent flavor, but the same can be said for most of these chains.  The fries were crispy and tasty, but the onion rings were inedible (very rubbery).  

The problem here is that Lush Burger is fairly pricey.  Burgers run about $11 and come with chips, which were not appetizing.  For $2 more you get fries; for $3, sweet potato fries.  This brings their price point above most of their competition, and the food just isn't worth it.

This particular location is also small and feels cramped.

Hint: Find and use coupons, go for happy hour, or look for daily specials, and your cost might be acceptable."}
{"text":"stopped in last night with my wife for a burger, beer and watch the cubs win.  Food was great.  we sat at the bar.  A young guy named Dale was our bartender/server and he couldn't have been nicer.  A woman who I think was the manager with a cubs jersey on was attentive to everyone and was super nice.
We will be back.

{"text":"We went for dinner! You have to try the tuna burger!  IT is AMAZING!! The service was fabulous! The staff was fabulous and they were always checking on us to see if we needed more water or another drink!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries,  friendly and talented staff, clean place , plenty of parking, a great place to eat with many tasty menu tastebud treats."}
{"text":"It's a Sunday afternoon around 2 pm, so the fam decides to grab a burger and relax on the patio. Well, we relaxed alright...for 45 minutes waiting for our food to come (which never did). Apparently the computers went down and our order was lost. The waiter apologized, but we waited and waited while tables that came AFTER us were served. Our kids were hungry (and so were we), so we left with empty stomachs and a bad taste in our mouth.

My advice...don't bother."}
{"text":"Best burger in AZ! Had the Western Burger and upgraded to the sweet potato fries. So good! Definitely coming back. The staff was friendly and has great customer service."}
{"text":"If I was strictly writing about the Lushburger Infusion then the rating would be 4 or 5 stars, but when I take into account everything else it drops Lush Burger's score big time. 

Like I said before I loved the infusion burger, the green chiles were a great compliment as well as the pepper jack cheese. I wish that was the only thing I tried...

Even though the chicken sandwich says lightly breaded, it's more like deep fried. It was basically a sloppy chicken parm sandwich. 

I also really didn't like the set up they have and I thought the waiter/bus boy was rude to the point where it is worth bringing up in this review. 

Overall I was disappointed because I know Matt Carter is tied to this restaurant and I love Zinc Bistro and The Mission."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. We were worried about the bad reviews but can honestly say we would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Been twice. Bad service and very very average food....bummer as it's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Lush Burger here I come again! 

Talk about a delicious hunk of meat! Not only is the burger a big size but the fries----- OH MY GOODNESS! We opted for the Truffle Oil Fries, and our friends did the 50/50 ( regular fries, sweet potatoe)

We ordered a Clint Eastwood burger, and a Lush Classic(although I was eyeing the Kobe beef burger the ENTIRE time). Menu is easy to read, and a flash screen helps you see what your burger will look like when made! The beverage cups are HUGE, and the choices fantastic! 
Beverage lists include, wine, beer, and champagne- Yes! you heard right.
Price is perfect for the portion sizes, and if you live in the area look for your coupon card. 

The decor is amazing! I felt super comfy in their booth, and even more comfy outside while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. They were extremely accomodating for our friends that have children with SEVERE food allergies-- a TRUE RECOMMENDATION for anyone with food allergies looking for an accomodating place without the severe looks of disdain.

LOVED IT! And definitely plan to go back"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Lush Burger this weekend, and we will definitely go back again. My faves were the truffle fries and the s'mores milk shake. My husband enjoyed his infusion burger (cheese and chilis were mixed into the beef patty).  It was a bit pricey for a lunch once you add in fries, drinks, and milkshakes. The crowd ranged from families w/ young kids to trendy couples. We also sat inside but there was a lovely patio with misters. We did not see the local root beer on draft until after we ordered, but we will try it next time!"}
{"text":"Meh, is the best word for Lush Burger. The menu recipes are interesting but the execution left a lot of room for improvement. At our table a chicken sandwich was way over cooked and a burger ordered medium looked like a hockey puck. The service was polite but indifferent. Overall, nothing awful, but there are WAY better burger options in the valley. You should skip Lush in favor of Deluxe, The Grind or many others. If you have to be right in this area (DC Ranch) the Burger at Market Street Kitchen blows Lush Burger's away."}
{"text":"Good burgers & fries but poor service. 

Frustrating service. We ordered appetizers and later we ordered burgers.  Appetizers arrived at same time as burgers.  

The burgers were ordered well-done but they came only medium.  Silverware was dirty."}
{"text":"Just way to much trouble than its worth. Terrible service!!!! Just know that going in. I was warned but thought I'd do better. I didn't! Lol.  Employees hangout at the bar talking about their lives. No time to do that pesky work thing. Save yourselves a ton of time and money. Skip it. Oh, my burger way burnt to a crisp but at least it was expensive."}
{"text":"The waiter was good but the food was just ok. I could have made the same burger at home for half the cost. The chips were good but a bit greasy."}
{"text":"This place is near work so decided to give it a try even though some reviews mentioned they were slow and had bad service. They must have taken the criticism to heart because the service on my visit was simply awesome - couldn't have been better.  Food came out hot and quick. Hope that Cheeseburgers and Beer hear that this place has stepped up their game.

Burger ran about $10 and includes house made thick cut chips.
Pretty on par pricing with the big sit down chains like Red Robin but much better burgers and atmosphere.

Likes:
Service was awesome!
The meat on the burger tasted good.
The chips were good.
Plenty of burger topping options.

Dislikes:
Even gas stations brew tea, get rid of those gross instant tea dispensers.
$3 to substitute fries is out of line.
Bun was dried out - try toasting your bread if you are going to let it dry out.
Gigantic light fixtures block TVs above the bar - bad design choice."}
{"text":"The burgers are good.  Unfortunately the wait staff spent the night chit chatting instead of waiting on us, the paying customers. I can make a great burger at home and have GREAT service.
Actually the staff were not professional not anyone I would ever hire."}
{"text":"Please stop Abusing the patties the way you do.   This place is so not worth the prices.   I have had a better meal at jack in the box and I would not feed that to my dogs.   Save ur money and go to in and out. . Service is better and food as well."}
{"text":"I have been holding onto coupons for Lush for awhile and decided finally to go for lunch.  The burgers were amazing. I had the western burger which had baroque sauce, cheese, bacon, and an onion ring on top of the patty. I have to say I was really impressed. The burger also comes with hand made chips which were really good. This was a great experience and I would recommend to anyone who hasn't been. You Scottsdale residents who get those coupons use them. It's with it."}
{"text":"Too many employees hang out and chat among themselves but fail to deliver. Customers receive incompetent service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"The new menu is very good, and they made the place more inviting and comfortable.  Our first trip in we had burgers and salads, and were very impressed with our meals.  The wait staff was rather curt and non responsive, but they were all new and we assumed it would get better.  I brought a client in today at 2 pm.  She was hungry and I wanted her to try it.  I sat alone on the patio for over 15 minutes while Waiting for her ... no one came out to greet me or get a drink order.  My client arrived and we sat for another 15 minutes with no one coming over.  There were 3 people on the patio eating and 2 inside eating. I could see the staff eating at a table and hanging at Bar.  Finally the girl came out and was obviously put out by us being there.  I had to get up twice to get my own sweetener ( which I asked for) and again to ask for a refill and to take our order. 32 minutes in.  Again, I was given the eye roll.  
We will not return.  I will never bring in clients again.  So sorry to have this type of disrespect for customers when the food was nice."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and my brother wanted a good burger so we decided to come here. I should have checked the yelp reviews first! 
lets start with the decor. I feel like I'm in a slaughter house with all the red and then they put cow hide on the bar chairs, just tacky. good idea to have a couple of TVs to watch games at the bar, bad idea to place them right behind the HUGE ikea lamps. 

Bathrooms: dirty, smelly. Gross!

Service: worst Ive experienced...ever! We walk in, stand next to the \"please wait to be seated sign\" for about 3 minutes until the girl leaning on the bar said we can sit anywhere we want. so we sit, wait another couple minutes for menus and another couple minutes for waters. About 10 minutes of reviewing the menu and waiting for our server, who was jamming out to the song playing outside, I flag down the manager texting behind the bar and tell her we are ready to order. FINALLY our server comes over, takes our order with the most careless attitude and looks at my empty water glass and asked me if I needed more water! WTF! Just fill it!!! 
Ok, so we wait another 20 minutes for food... soo annoyed at this point!

The burgers were all cooked to sh**, they were dry and unpleasant. They sauce that was on my burger was just soaked up in the huge bun that looks like it was purchased at Fry's bakery. The kids sliders, just bread and more burnt pieces of meat. no ketchup, no cheese. All the ranch, and BBQ is from a bottle, nothing is made here as it states it is on the menu."}
{"text":"It's amazing, being that we live within walking distance of Lush Burger, we don't come here more often. 
We met some friends for Friday Happy Hour and were very pleased with what we found. 
Domestic and premium beers were a great deal and 2 $2 sliders made for a solid meal. 
The front room was amazingly friendly and our waitress, Lauren, made our visit über positive.
Menu prices seemed very reasonable for Scottsdale and for a burger joint they have a nice variety of food and drink choices. 
I'd recommend this restaurant as a good find and a great deal. 
Bon apetit."}
{"text":"We always order the Clint Eastwood burger, which is like a souped up, and much better tasting western bacon cheeseburger, onion ring and all.  Definitely get the truffle fries-tasty! Comes in a mini deep fryer basket too.  I've gotten the truffle fries mixed with the sweet potato fries and that is pretty good if you like sweet and savory combo.  

They seem to have a pretty good happy hour with some specials on food, even though we haven't made it to one there yet.  They do hal price bottles of wine 2 night /week as well.   

The dessert here is just alright.  We've had the 1/2 baked cookie, and if you've ever had a 'pazookie' from Oregano's (the only thing edible there) LB's dessert just does not compare.  I think they need to tweak their cookie dough recipe-it's a bit on the sweeeeet side.  The shakes are a bit better-it's huge and very shareable....or a meal in itself-Ha!

I like this place overall...Are they the most AMAZING burgers Ive ever experienced? No, But I will continue patronizing Lush because it's very close to where we live, the staff is SUPER nice, GREAT service, (they bring everything to the table even though you order at the counter) cute decor, nice patio for when it's not 100+ degrees out, and the food pretty good!"}
{"text":"Really bad service, I felt discriminated. My server came once, and that's about it . They brought the other tables food except mine after a 40 min wait the food came but they had messed up my food. So I had to wait another 25. In for my food to arrived. Ugh really bad service!!!! Not coming back again."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been to LushBurger.  A good burger.  Not the best around but a good burger. The question I have is why they insist on putting a big burger and fries on the smallest plate possible.  Makes it very difficult to eat.  Pop for some bigger plates please!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for a burger! Their fries that come with certain meals are very good but could use a little salt / pepper added to them. The lush fries are also very good for people who like plain french fries. I get the same thing every time and it just gets better every time I eat it. It does get very old in here so I recommend either sitting outside (When the weather is nice) or either bringing a little shrug / sweater to wear while inside the restaurant. Service is very fast, they are always nice and do frequent checks to see if everything is good or if you need anything else."}
{"text":"We all know that the valley is saturated with burger joints. This restaurant looks a little bit more posh than others with their expensive furniture and an oversized patio near Pima road. While I occasionally crave a good burger, I hate paying more than $ 10 for it no matter how good it is. Sorry a burger is just that: a burger unless of course there is foie gras (goose liver for the unfamiliar) on it, then there is a warrant to pay extra otherwise NOT!

On my last visit, I sat the bar and I thought the service and my burger were very good .
What drives me up the wall is paying extra for cheese and fries.

These days I want value for my buck and lush does not exactly deliver that. I do wish them success considering there is plenty of competition in the upscale burger market in the valley:

The Grind
Blu Burger
Local Bistro
Tavern Americana

I almost ordered a milkshake to wash the burger down but changed my mind after I noticed they used Hershey syrup. Sorry, I don't like Hershey syrup no matter how popular it is. I expect a higher quality syrup if I am going to pay $ 6 for a milkshake, and not all the artificial ingredients that Hershey syrup contains like high fructose corn syrup!

Will it be worth my return visit: sorry No - as there is nothing lush about the place except of course the expensive, cow skin laden furniture (seats)...."}
{"text":"Tried Lush Burger last night. They have a nice ambiance with a great outdoor patio. You place your order inside, then a bevy of servers bring you your drinks, orders, etc. 

We ordered and shared the regular burger with Vermont white cheddar cheese and the Lush Burger Infusion (pepperjack, green chilies, chipotle aioli). Both burgers came with a thousand island type dressing on the side. For sides we ordered the truffle fries (came with ketchup on the side) and sweet potato fries (some type of dipping sauce, possibly their chipotle aioli?). 

Verdict: 
Food- The fries were good! The burgers were just okay to me. I felt like they were somewhat lacking in flavor. My boyfriend commented that he really liked the ice (that's right, the ice). It was pretty good ice though. It was that small, crunchy ice (not quite crushed) which reminded me of childhood Pizza Hut visits. 

Locale- The outdoor patio is big and has huge umbrellas - it has a loungy feel to it. Wide variety of customers, but it definitely attracted a lot of the \"Scottsdale\" crowd. One quiet group we saw had 4 out of the 6 people in the group texting. 

Service- Good service, A LOT of very attentive servers. Felt well taken care of. 

My first visit didn't blow me away, but I'll probably go back for another try."}
{"text":"Hey Lush.....what happened??  We really used to enjoy this place a lot and would bring out-of-town guests here (we live walking distance away).  We went last week and what a disaster!  It started with the drinks.  My brother ordered a margarita and is was bland.  I ordered a glass of red wine and it was VERY oxidized...even the smell was disgusting.  Our waitress brought out another glass, and it was still bad (obviously they thought I was stupid).  I decided to order a different wine (more expensive) and that glass was fine.  The buggers still charged us for the bad wine I did not drink....wtf.  My brother and I both ordered the farmers market salad...both showed up with a drop of dressing, so we asked for more.  Big mistake....the dressing was horribly bland.  My husband's burger was just ok, definitely a step down from past visits.  And the bathrooms could use some attention as well.

So, we will not be back for a while, if at all.  What a shame.....we came here several times a month for the past several years.  I just wondered what happened?  Are there new owners/managers?"}
{"text":"I loved the location and the setup of this place. Very cute. Everyone I was with really liked their food. My burger just wasn't as good as Indulge. I would go here again to try something else though!"}
{"text":"Lush Burger had a great friendly staff. We loved the salad, burgers and drinks. This is a happy place to be with a great patio. It is well-managed. Do come in and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is neither great nor terrible. I live nearby therefore wanted to check it out. I visited a couple times and both times I got the same thing and felt guilty after - guilty for wasting my cheat meal here. The burgers are pretty pricey and they lack flavor or are too dry. I was with my wife and friends and therefore we had the opportunity to try different burgers and all left with a negative impression. One thing that really bothered us was that the burgers come with house made potato chips instead of fries which are extra. I've NEVER heard of that. I'd rather get no side and pay for an option (like at Hopdoddy) than get chips and pay to sub fries. Really wanted to love this place since I live so close but alas, it wasn't meant to be :/"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place. Went there for lunch and not only did we have to wait 45 minutes for our burgers, they were cold when we got them. We let the staff know in a nice way of our displeasure, and they just acted indifferent. The burgers weren't very good either, but that may have been a result of them being cold."}
{"text":"I visit this Lush Burger location often as I have a business in the same plaza.  The lunch is always excellent and you get plenty of it.  (Try the home-made potato chips!)

Happy hour is an excellent deal!  The wine is good and the pepperoni pizza is one of my favorites (I'm Sicilian).  Plus, the outside seating is a great atmosphere.  This is a good place to socialize after work!"}
{"text":"I usually sit at the bar here and the service and attentiveness is absolutely stellar. One of the best happy hours in the area. They also invest in the local community and that goes a long way with me!"}
{"text":"Their gluten-free veggie burger is surprisingly full of flavor and always cooked to perfection!! It is my absolute FAVORITE burger in town!!! My kids want to go there every day after school and I love to watch football games. Needless to say....everyone is happy! Great service the employees are fabulous!"}
{"text":"It's always nice when you look at a restaurants reviews on here and see the owners/managers ACTUALLY responding.  Seems Lush Burger doesn't care - I don't see anything in the way of management response.  That should have been my 2nd clue (the first being the overwhelming number of UNDERwhelming reviews.  Oh well....

The place has a groovy, contemporary appeal to it and after reading the menu online, I felt it was worth a try.  They are VERY close to our office so \"the girls\" and I decided to bop down there in my mommymobile and burger down.  

First of all - ANY place open for lunch had darned well better know their business lunch crowd: here's a hint, Lush Burger.... if people walk in wearing ID badges, THEY'RE BUSINESS LUNCHERS.  While most of us aren't on a \"1 hour only for lunch\" type of schedule, most of us have OBLIGATIONS such as meetings or conference calls.  On the other hand, if a couple of svelte senior women in their tennis gear walk in, chances are, they're in no rush.  

We sat and waited several minutes before our menus were even delivered.  That should have been a hint for us to bolt and go to AJ's for a sandwich.  FINALLY menus were delivered and our drink orders were taken.  As far as the iced tea is concerned - skip it - it's a horrible mix.  Blech.  

When we FINALLY got our burgers which were touted as \"cooked medium\", I was saddened to see that mine was a very, very well done.  I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for a (fricken) burger, so I just ate it.  The bun was wonderful, the butter lettuce, fantastic.  I couldn't taste the \"special sauce\" - I think it was sucked into the dryness of my burger.  The meat had no flavor - not even that good \"beefy\" flavor that Smashburger is soo good at.  It was flat out WAY too overcooked.  

The chips were decent and a nice change from what you normally get at a burger place.  I usually pass on french fries @ burger places because they take up too much room in my stomach, which means less room for burger.  The home-made chips were enough of a potato flavor to highlight the meal, but not too much so as to render you completely full about halfway through your meal.

Won't be back.  Sorry Lush - I wanted to like you - you're so close to my office.  But yuk."}
{"text":"Our family loves this little slice of deliciousness in DC Ranch and have been coming here since it opened. Recently it went through ownership and menu changes that are all good. We love the management team and the wait staff. The food is excellent and the kids enjoy the variety of milkshakes. New drink specials make it \"Happy Hour\" nearly every time we go and monthly burger specials keep the menu fresh. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So I went twice in one week the first experience was much different than the second time that's why I'm giving a two star review , The food is good that's why I returned. The problem here is the service !!!!  I went with my husband on a Saturday night pretty early to grab a quick bite and get hm in time to put out babies to sleep. The girl was a we had was not very good she came to take our order we ordered two burgers I ordered mine protein style with veggies Instead of fries I asked her can I sub that she said yes no problem my husband ordered a beer and burger and fries they do upcharge $2 for fries no big deal. So we were waiting around for our food I look over and see that ours is up and she finally came with t about ten min later so my husbands fries were completely cold Allen f with his burger he didn't say anything and just ate it then the bill came ? And it was almost $60 so I looked the bill over and she had charged us for an extra beer and onion rings which we did not order ? And explained the veggies were a $3 upcharge that she didn't mention I paid $3 for celery ??? I also noticed the price of or burgers were different even though we ordered same thing ? I asked to see the menu and she jacked the price up by $2 and there was also an open food item of $3 & another $2 so we asked her why the burgers were priced different and to adjust  the bill since she had tried to overcharge us . She adjusted but the bill was still wrong !!! I asked her about the bill and explained this still is wrong ? She said of you must have added grilled onions to burger I said no confused ? She said let me go look she came back and said oh sorry and just left not adjusting the bill ? At this point my husband was just ready to leave she obviously is not the sharpest Crayon in the box. So if you decide to go here check your bill I feel this is a regular thing of them adding things to your bill and hope you don't notice because earlier in the week I went with a girlfriend and they added on a small charge as well I just figured the first time honest mistake ? So makes you think maybe they leave the open food item and take the cash themselves ? Kinda shady."}
{"text":"Great local burger place! We have tried numerous ones and have never been disappointed. Love the frozen margaritas, so get here for happy hour. The large patio is super...live music would be awesome?"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and sweet potato fries!  Got the PittsBurger... fabulous. Love the decor inside and the bar stools. Good location just North of 101. Will return."}
{"text":"The hangover  burger and The tuna salad are amazing! They have an incredible happy hour with great deals. Every time I've come in the staff is great, this place is totally kid friendly for lunch and dinner. During happy hour it's more of a social crowd. Make sure you ask to customize anything you order because they totally can. I'm going to be hosting a happy hour event here and really excited for my pick of venue. The manager Giovanni  was very nice and took time to be very detail orientated with what I needed when In the last I  wanted  involvement in my bloggers dinner club. A group of my bloggers came through and blogged  about and raved about the excellent service and hot wings! I haven't tried the hot wings yet but now I'm super excited. But like I said they make the best ahi tuna salad in town that comes with great pretzel bread!

{"text":"Just had lunch there and all I came away with was \"meh\". The food I would give three stars, service would be four but the way they nickel and dime you brings it to a two. The burger is ok, just reminds me of what you get at a backyard grill and the fries were a bit on the too seasoned side. What really got me is that for $10 all you get is a patty on a bun then they hit you with extras. They charge you $.50 per veggie that you want to add ie...lettuce,tomato,onion,pickles. I literally got one piece of lettuce and was charged $.50 and the jalapenos weren't even fresh but out of a can. Then if you want cheese that's another $1 or some sauce $.75. So for two burgers, fries and a soda with tip was about $40. Def save yourself some money and go to Smash, In n Out, Habit or Zipps. Better food for a better price."}
{"text":"It took a very long time to get our burger, the place was not busy at all. When we got our medium rare burgers they were completely raw inside. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"I read some bad reviews about this place but I decided to check it out myself since it's right down the road from my hotel.  It wasn't busy, I was seated immediately.  I got the western burger with fries.  The food was good, however they charge you $2 for fries if you don't get the house chips.  I don't understand why that's necessary to charge more for fries.  That was the only downfall.   Everything else fine."}
{"text":"I was really not impressed with the service or the food.  First of all, our party of 4 was the only party in the restaurant at lunch, and yet they screwed up our order. Two of us ordered the same burger, one well done, one medium.  It turned out, they got the burgers mixed up and gave me the well done one...YUCK! It was dry and burnt (I ordered the medium).  When I told them about it, after I had already bitten into it, the kid just said, \"OH\", and didn't do anything about it....how can they screw that order up when we were the only people there?  Very mediocre food...wouldn't go there again for a pricey, meh burger."}
{"text":"I'd give food four starts for the type of restaurant it is. However, they don't have a lot of seating. 

I was hoping to eat here tonight, but was told over the phone that I could be seated immediately, but would have to wait for food and drinks 30-45 minutes. For a place with as little seating as they have, I'm surprised the kitchen can't keep up with how many people are there. I'd imagine enough kitchen staff to serve the full restaurant in a reasonable amount of time wouldn't be too much to ask. Back to Cold Beer And Cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"It was pretty empty when we got there at 5. Ordered the hamburgers with chips snd one with fries ($2 extra). Nice brioche bun and tasty flavor with abundant and fresh condiments, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. Happy hour menu limited and the pizza was not available. The best thing about LB was Gary! He was a great server and his smile made us feel very welcome indeed!"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Had their basic burger w fries/sweet potato fries.  It wasn't bad, but nothing makes me really want to go back. If you're in Scottsdale, try Indulge Burger instead."}
{"text":"Good spot for burgers and salads. The brioche bun could have been a little fresher. They also have great Sunday football specials as well as a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Ok. Think we're going to give this place a try tonite. It's down the road from our house and we have been wondering if it's any good. Fingers crossed as it sound really YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best food ever!! Everything is perfect! I give this 5 stars! Service is awesome, i just can't explain"}
{"text":"Went here during a volleyball tournament because it was close. At first we say inside, but got no service and it was stuffy, do we moved outside. The food was ok, but that was about it. Our server, River was great and just because of him we may come back."}
{"text":"A buddy brought me here to say thanks for helping him move.  We were the only two there around 9:30 on a Saturday night.  He recommended the turkey burger so that is what I went with.  I found that it lacked flavor.  Sure, it was huge but it was bland."}
{"text":"Solidly mediocre. Warning: the root beer is $4 per glassThe champagne vinaigrette has an offensive, odd flavor...almost soapy. My mom's gluten-free pizza crust (with $4 upcharge) was served raw so we asked them to put it back in the oven. 15 minutes later it came back out...still not thoroughly cooked. They gave a 50% discount on the pizza, but probably should've just comped the whole thing. Chicken wings were just fine. Good crispy fries. Pretzel with cheese sauce was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I'm not clamoring to come back here. Friendly service, though."}
{"text":"Lush is located in DC Ranch and has nice outdoor seating. Julianna was our efficient server. We arrived at 12:30 and there were only 5 or six other tables seated. We ordered the Maui Wowey and the Yippee-I- Ayyyy. We did not have much time to eat, but thankfully everything arrived pretty quickly. They don't scrimp on the toppings for the burgers so they look pretty impressive when they come out.  We both upgraded our sides to onion rings for an extra $3. which does make for some pricey meals.  Although I liked all the fun toppings on my burger, the patty itself was a little bland. Two burgers and an Arnold Palmer and this is an expensive place to eat lunch for $42."}
{"text":"LushBurger is the bomb! The Ahi Tuna burger is amazing, AND the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which I have basically every single time now. It is amazing and flavorful. The fries are really great too. There are a LOT of delicious shakes, even red velvet cupcake! My vegan friend had the Inside Out Veggie Burger and LOVED it.. and she can hardly ever eat at restaurants! My friends and I will definitely be back to sit outside, the patio is awesome."}
{"text":"Even thought their website says to not be shy and write in if you have any issues...they will not respond if you do"}
{"text":"Due to food allergies I have to have certain food removed and generally the chef or grill cook is helpful that allows me to spend time with friends while enjoying a meal out.  However my lunch yesterday for a gluten free vegan pizza without mushrooms was less than creative Mariana tomatoes and basil for 16.00$ Not worth the money by any means and less than tasty just a waste of money.  Totally sick of being punished due to food allergies when out, tired of less than creative cooks who are working professionally.  Not returning to Lush Burger!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Loved the burger and fries.  They have a great patio as well."}
{"text":"Just amazing in town again. Had 13$ tuna dish amazing cooked perfectly melted like butter. Side of teriyaki dipping sauce Moe ploy and garlic dipping sauce all amazing think vegas like in Scottsdale. Rents had crab cake trio for the portion they could of done with 2. And burger side onion rings where crispy. Nick was a great server. Also they allow small pets on outside patio with leash"}
{"text":"Second time in---- yum to the veggie Quinoa burger. Wow!"}
{"text":"I met with 3 other people for lunch at Lush Burger on Friday.  We were seated promptly, the service by Jessica was great, and the Ahi Tuna was superb.  In the future, I will avoid the house made chips.  Nice place and friendly, attentive service."}
