{"text":"First time in this place, very cute design. I like the cartoons on the wall and warm color scheme.  We went with a party for 4.  Wait staff was friendly and recommended some of the popular dishes. We ordered fried chicken kara age,  very nice dish  for appetizer. Then we had duck poutine, chicken pizza and cheese mac. All dishes with influence of Asian flares.  I liked  the pizza most because the the Cheese and Asian sauce go really well  together.  Last we ordered green tea parfait.  A must have! Pricing adequate and they gave you big portion. I will come back with friends. It is a nice place for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the place where Grand Noodle use to be.  Came for lunch. We were seated quickly.  Ordered the Chicken Karaage Pizza which was a lunch special and Grandma's Spaghetti and Meatballs.  The lunch special came with a 'homemade' drink which turned out to be lemonade.   Food was served relatively quickly.    The pizza was loaded with chicken karaage and had bits of pineapple, onion, seaweed plus lots of cheese.  A sweet BBQ type sauce was drizzled over the pizza.  Crust was crispy and base of pizza not soggy.  Overall, a good fusion pizza with lots of good flavours.  I'm not a fan of seaweed but still gobbled the pizza down.    The spaghetti was good as well.  It was cooked al dente.  The sauce was flavourful with chunks of small fresh tomatoes, onions, broccoli, and parsley.  The chicken and beef meatballs were soft and cooked well.  A generous amount of mozzarella cheese topped the dish.  I also like the fact that the dish was served in a hot iron skillet.  Kept the food warm as we ate.  The male server came by to check in on us and refill our waters which I thought was nice considering it was rather busy.  He also packed our leftovers.   Overall, would recommend this place.  Will be back soon to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with the kids. We ordered 3 lunch specials: chicken kaarage pizza, mushroom mac and cheese and the hamburger beef steak. You can choose one of four sauces to go with the hamburger so we chose the garlic yakiniku sauce recommended by the server.  Our fav was the pizza. Large pieces of chicken, onion, pineapple, topped with bonito flakes and yummy mayo. The mac and cheese was good but like some other reviews, there weren't as many mushrooms as we would have thought. It did also have cauliflower and bits of bacon. The hamburger was ok. My 6yo loved the veggies that came with the dish more than the actual hamburger. Next time we'll try the chicken steak and maybe a different sauce. We chose lemonade to go with our food and it was really good too.  Service was quick and friendly. Nice place to come with friends or with the family. Also want to try their take out special."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Service was really nice and above average at a Chinese food styled restaurant. Place was very cute with designs and a really great variety of foods! Would recommend here to grab a quick bite with some friends as well as they offer vegetarian dishes! Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I tried this place during lunch recently and found the service and decor to be okay.  I ordered the Mushroom Mac and cheese from their lunch menu and it came with a complimentary lemonade or pop. The portion size was very big and was served hot, so I found their lunch menu to be of good value.  I'm not too much of a fan of cheese, so I'm giving this a 4/5. I like the concept and would recommend this place if you're a fan of cheese!"}
{"text":"If you've never had decent italian food, then this place would be pretty good.  But for me who's italian experience is limited to Frankie Tomatoe's AYCE, this place is already bad.    Our table ordered 4 different dishes.  Only the Mac & Cheese was decent, but even that was rather lacking.  Also, dont call it \"Mac & Cheese with mushrooms\" if theres bacon bits on it, and then when i order, ask if i'm a vegetarian... You should right in 'optional bacon bits'.    The other dishes we had, like the tempura pizza was interesting.  I mean, its different, i'll give it that, and would have been a good dish overall, but it had this strange taste to it.  The spaghetti and meatball were pretty bad.  Not sure how you mess up a standard italian dish like that... But the sauce, and meatballs were pretty bad.  The ravioli we got, (forgot the name of dish) was bad.  Taste was passable... but the looks of it was odd.  It was a very thick brown sauce that just didn't look good.  It would have overall been better, if it hadn't been the very odd look to it that just made you not want to eat it.  Lastly, the service was... okay... The night i went it, it was busy, and had some people waiting in line to sit, but there was some odd things... Like, most of the dishes came in a extremely hot cast iron pan.  Nothing wrong with that, but, they served all the dishes in the center of the table.  We had no realistic way of moving it ourselves, even though when it came, we told them it was for this person, and was just placed on the table, and she left... We had to move it ourselves, which was not easy.  We took the napkins of a few of us, and had to carefully move the pan ourselves without burning our hands.  They have baking mits...  They should definitely move it to the person eating the dish, as you probably dont want customers accidentally burning themselves..  Overall, the general experience was poor.  I'm not sure i would ever go again.  Considering the prices, there are many other places i would rather go."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for lunch. Looks like the fondue isn't offered anymore but I did enjoy the pastas. they has a great deal on their carbon drinks for $2.99 with any meal however I think that deal is gone now. Staff is very friendly. Will definitely be back. Only thing is I wish they took credit / debit."}
{"text":"There's a promotion going on when we went on Saturday: 10% off the bill and $2.99 slushies. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. We ordered the soy milk and laksa fondues. The fondue isn't the traditional gooey cheesy pot, but that maybe a different case if you order the Swiss fondue or other variants. They were tasty though!  We already ordered the lamb ragu (nothing special), and a truffle tagliatelle (great, but probably wouldn't order again). They have an extensive dessert menu (didn't try any)! This could be a late night hangout spot for desserts.  I'd return again as it was an interesting experience, and probably try the more popular fondues like the Swiss one next time."}
{"text":"We had two items: 1. Mac and cheese - served with hot plate, nice and hot, decent flavour 2. bacon/pineapple/jalapeno pizza - a O-K, loaded with cheese  Servers are extremely friendly and attentive.  Cash Only.  10% off the entire bill. Ok food.  They are still working on the menu so you see things deleted from original menu.  Overall, a nice and friendly place."}
{"text":"I finished a long day of work and wasn't too hungry. My friend asked me to join her for dinner at Game of cheese, i thought it was a interesting name. We ordered Duck poutine, Black truffle carbonara tagliatelle, and four cheese pizza from the secret menu. I m so happy to find a Italian restaurant. High quality of food with decent price. No need to travel to down town for good Italian foods anymore. Definitely have to try their Duck poutine and 4 cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I've been waiting anxiously for this place to open so I could find it what it actually was, and it turns out it's an amazing Asian fusion restaurant!   They offer several pastas that are served on a hot iron skillet, as well as their main attraction, cheese fondue pots. You get to choose a variety of pots that have several different ingredients inside (mussels, ham, corn, shrimp, along with a whole bunch of stuff) along with cheese and as many carbs as you want thanks to free refills.   We went with our waiters recommendation of the Grandmas Meatball Spaghetti and the Italian Cheese Fondue. The spaghetti was unique and delicious and the meatballs were too good to describe. Also the best thing for me was the portion, it was HUGE! As for the fondue, it's basically a hot pot with a cheesy base, and although I'm not a big fan of hot pot , I did enjoy that meal quite a lot. We really wanted to try one of the pots that included fried chicken, sausage, mushroom, and a ton of other stuff that my companion (the first reviewer) and I liked a lot, but they didn't have it ready unfortunately. Understandable since it's only their second day of business.   The service was probably the best experience I've had with servers. We were helped numerous times by the friendly staff and 3 or 4 different people were there checking on everyone and were there if you needed anything. We didn't have to ask for anything unless we needed a refill of noodles.   We will definitely be back as there is so much on the menu that we wanted to try!! Savoury apps, carbon slush, and homemade ice cream just to name a few. Great spot to try and wishing this place the best! 5/5"}
{"text":"Love the karage pizza and mushroom Mac and cheese. Truffle pasta was lovely to smell as it had a strong truffle fragrance but taste I found the other dishes to be better. Quite packed on weekends unfortunately but lots of space weeknights!"}
{"text":"Honestly the food wasn't all that great. All the cheese in the fondue ended up at the bottom of the bowl despite the efforts of preventing it from sticking to the bottom. The seafood pasta was really average and we had to ask 3 times for my friend's snowball dessert. The servers were friendly but the food took quite a while. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"As a cheese fanatic, I was really excited to see a restaurant focused on cheese as the primary star. Given that many restaurants specializing in cheese have closed down, this showed great promise. Unfortunately, my hopes were quickly dashed as it did not deliver on food or service.   Despite the decor and attractive menu that seems to sell on the cheese theme, the dishes itself were definitely not cheesy enough. The worst thing is to order poutine which was drenched in gravy but NOT have enough cheese. There's also no strong, exotic cheeses on the menu like blue cheese. Granted, that's not everyone's thing, but it's like walking into a steakhouse with no filet mignon.   I ordered one of their vegetarian pizzas. Flavor and crust was light, but indeed the cheesy flavor did not come through despite use of 4 different cheeses. Where's the ooey, gooey cheese with that kick of strong flavor? Sadly enough, I think any pizza joint could deliver more on the cheese.  The more popular dish is the Japanese Seafood Yuzu Cream Spaghetti. However, the portion that you get for what you pay didn't seem to be of value. The sauce was unique (though I still would not consider it to be overly cheesy), though my party commented that it tasted relatively similar to any pasta with cheesy cream sauce at asian fusion cafes in the area. Also of note, one of the tables next to us also sent theirs back as the seafood was undercooked, yikes.  The worst was the wait. Service was very slow, and it took 1-1.5 hours for our food to come out. This is probably not the length of time you would like to wait for poutine, pizza, and pasta. The servers acknowledged this and provided us and all the tables around us complimentary sorbets because it.was.just.THAT.slow.  Sorbet, surprisingly, was very good. Bursting in flavor. Looking at the menu, the desserts also looked super appealing.  Also cash only, which is kind of surprising for a restaurant like this.  Consensus:  I think this restaurant should be rebranded as a dessert place. Otherwise this restaurant is as cheesy as cottage cheese - so light, but generic and forgettable that I forgot if there was a flavor. True cheese fans will probably be disappointed. Given the competition for food in this area, I won't return for the food or service, and would look elsewhere to get my cheese fix."}
{"text":"Black Truffle Carbonara Tagliatelle, sitting at the top of the menu at $18.99, had the honour of being my lunch today. Garnished with healthy grating of parmesean, pea shoots, a raw egg and grated black truffle, this sizeable dish certainly looks to be delicious, but was it?  After combining the egg with noodles (which I thought was more fettuccine than tagliatelle), I dug into the quite sizeable portion, whereupon my first bite revealed not a fresh, perfectly al dente pasta, but a formerly dry noodle that spent an extra thirty seconds too long in the bath. Pushing aside my disappointment, I turned my attention to the unmistakable delight of black truffles which single-handedly carries this dish (and also dominates over the other flavours). While containing pancetta, a raw egg and cheese, I found the flavour of the sauce to be single dimensional, with consistency on the looser side. A little more richness to better bind the sauce to the noodles at the beginning, instead of leaving a pool at the end would have been welcome. It isn't to say that this dish wasn't good, but the potential is there to be great.  In terms of service, our party was a large group of nine with five other tables of two in the restaurant. Our dishes came out staggered, with the first diner finishing before the ninth diner received their meal. This was explained to us that there were only two chefs in the kitchen and as a consolation, we were offered a gratuitous drink - a choice of lemonade or blue raspberry lemonade. I chose the latter, but received (what I am sure was) blue koolaid instead. Recommendation: forego this.  In general, the size of each dish is quite large (ravioli notwithstanding), and the value for each is quite high. With that in mind, if you come with the expectation of an average meal at a reasonable cost, you would not leave disappointed. Just don't drink the koolaid."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new restaurant out as food choices seemed quite different. Should had read some other reviews prior to going.   Many food bloggers say their experience overall was mediocre and wouldn't go again. That was kind of the same case for my friends and I. It was a late Wednesday evening and there was only a few tables occupied, however the food took quite some time to come out.   Food was mediocre... just pasta with cheese ontop nothing to special. We tried the koji chicken appetizer which was probably the best part. Chicken was juicy but sauce was meh. Tasted just like soya sauce mixed with some vinegar."}
{"text":"One thing that stood out to me the most was not the food, rather the service. It seemed like depending on where you sat in the restaurant, you'll end up with better service than others. I've seen many tables receive their food faster than others despite placing them around the same time (or even faster). It also took about 2 tries and a 10 minute wait to get water.   When I heard of this restaurant, I was thinking that they would offer more cheesy dishes like fondue. They actually offer more simpler, classic dishes such as pasta and pizza. I was surprised that there wasn't more cheese in their dishes. Their dishes are more so unique and places a Japanese / Asian twist on these classic Western dishes. I had the shrimp tempura pizza which came with a thin crust topped with tempura, artificial crab meat, and corn.   Cash or debit only. Best to make reservations on weekend as it gets quite busy."}
{"text":"Food is lacking flavor, depth, and ingredients. We got several fondue pots, which were watery and salty, and not much more than that."}
{"text":"Feel relaxed sitting at the restaurant after ordering my lunch special. For each lunch special comes with a free lemonade  or simply add $2.50 for a special drink and my husband ordered an iced  matcha with red bean.  Japanese Style Seafood Yuzu Cream Risotto with Misoyaki Salmon (score 5/5) The top layer is slightly torched. Patches of burnt marks can be seen. Looks impressive!!  Inside the bowl, it has salmon  , shrimps , crab meat , mushrooms, snow peas and corns. The rice  is bigger than the type I used to have. It's chewy and full of texture! Overall, the rice is creamy and it is  delicious! I should mention there's a lot of cheese  melted on the first layer of the rice. Yummy !  Japanese Seafood Pizza (score 4.5/5) The crust is thin and crispy. I like it!! That means I am not stuffed with carbohydrates. On the  pizza, there are a lot of toppings,  Avocado , Salmon , Fish roes,  shrimps, crab meat , corns and cheese . I can identify the sauce on top of the pizza is mayonnaise with wasabi. The pizza is not too bad, slightly salty to my taste.  These two lunch specials come with a choice of a free lemonade  or add $2.50 to get a special drink. We ordered a lemonade and an iced matcha with red beans. The lemonade tastes good. The matcha is a bit too sweet to me, even though I have waited for the ice to melt to dilute the sweetness.   Overall, the food is good. I would want to come back to trying some other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"CLOSED  A lot of reviews mention Game of Cheese doesn't use any special ingredients or special cheese, so I came expecting mediocre food.   I'm impressed by the creative fusion menu and that's entirely why I'm still rating Game of Cheese as 3 stars - there is a tempura shrimp pizza which looks as weird as it sounds but tastes surprisingly good. There's just a hint of japanese sauce and it's an unexpected taste along with the cheese. There's also a lot of dessert options.   I do not recommend their duck poutine - it tastes entirely like baked frozen fries with gravy and the smallest slices of 'duck' on top. Quite possibly the only poutine I've been unable to finish.   Portion-wise, the pizza has six small slices which may not be enough for a hungry adult. Thankfully their pasta sizes are slightly larger.  I can understand the negative reviews because the ingredients are otherwise very unimpressive - for example, my Japanese 'seafood' pasts consists of frozen imitation crab.   The staff are mostly very young and quite inexperienced. For instance, they brought an incorrect number of water for the party and even when reminded did not bring additional water. Also, because they can get busy, our water was never refilled in our entire time there."}
{"text":"They tried to over play on the cheese. It is game of cheese. We ordered 3 dishes to share amongst 3 of us. Although the portion sizes were adequate, nothing to rave home about.  The one thing I remember were the fondue. They taste more on the floury side than cream and cheese. Adjustment may be required in the recipe   I would bring my appetite elsewhere"}
{"text":"Cheesy | Affordable | Cash Only | Good Portion  This place has been open for a while and its never busy busy. It's a good concept but maybe in the wrong area.   The food is okay but not super special for me to come back. The interior design is cute though. Service is okay and its bright and spacious.  I'm not a fan of the non-tablecloth idea. The pig design is cute on table but even a clear table cloth would be better because after food the table feels quite dirty.  Korean fried seaweed The pieces came less than shown on menu. It's okay. Deep fried seaweed wrapped with vermicelli inside.  Japanese seafood spaghetti  It's good portion for one person. It's loaded with toppings but I was a bit turned off seeing imitated crab meat on it. It still had some shrimp and calamari and fish roe.  Shrimp pizza It's very heavy, and loaded with sauce. I feel it's too saucy where it's weighing it down along with the cheese. It doesn't look like it's too much till you eat two pieces and got full from the sauces.  Passion fruit white peach sorbet carbon  Decent price for this dessert drink $5.99. Milk pudding at bottom."}
{"text":"Came back for lunch and was happy to see that they have a revised lunch menu which includes pasta options that include a lemonade at a fair price.  The truffle pasta is still my favourite, and the Korean egg rice was not bad.  Portion sizes are good and they are usually not too busy.  I will come back to try the risotto soon."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. I really wanted to get some cheese fondue and after reading some reviews, made a reservation for this place. Was super dissapointed that the menu on Yelp does not match the menu available in their resto. They didn't have any fondue!!  The service was terrible today. Took us 30 minutes to finally order then another 40 minute to get some apps. Another 20 for the last entree my friend had ordered. The bill even took a long time too. There was literally only one girl working the whole restaurant. There were tons of people waiting for tables, wiaitng to order, waiting for their food etc. When we got the bill she just left the machine with us... Luckily I knew how to work one of those debit machines so I just basically worked as a server  for my tables bills. We wanted dessert too but service was seriously really terrible, we couldn't wait to leave.   Oh and the food is mediocre. I had the sweet corn which was good, small portion I was hoping for corn on the cob but it wasn't. We had the duck poutine which was alright. Karage chicken pizza and seafood linguine. All of these items could seriously use some more cheese! It is game of cheese afterall, go nuts on cheese, that's what we came for."}
{"text":"It's good enough for me to return during off-peak hours for the Mac N Cheese or green tea Oreo cheese cake with sherbet. I've been here four times and was satisfied, though not to the point where I was gushing over it. I would hope they would be more creative with the cheese, but it's more like the cheese is an after thought. Like: how can we add cheese to this to fit the menu? Also, one time they featured a blue raspberry lemonade with the lunch special and it just tasted like they added koolaid or crystal light to it lol... Not sure how that was supposed to go with a cheesy pasta or pizza. Still, I always had a good experience here. Hope they continue to improve."}
{"text":"Very interesting and unique menu items. Their branding is top notch. Cute characters, menu and store interior. The food is probably just average. It is not bad. The tempura pizza was pretty good, I would probably order it again next time. Truffle carbonara was not bad too, literally your average carbonara with truffle paste on top. Can't go wrong. Service is good, wait times for food was normal. I would recommend this place if you want to try some new, interesting fusion dishes."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced but they had creative dishes. I tried their pizzas and a pasta dish and they are alright; not as cheesy as I wanted it to be. They didn't have fondue when I went which was a bit diss appointing. The wallpaper in the restaurant is really cute though."}
{"text":"Location/Service: Took over the place where Grand Noodle used to be - so it's inside Commerce Gate with lots of parking available. Inside has really cute decorations and art. The giant piece on the wall is drawn by a local artist, which I thought was nice. Service was good as staff were attentive and tries to help you as much as they can.  Food - this is based on the recent Yelp Event, where I got to try several items on them menu.  ARANCINI BALLS - essentially a fried ball of cheese. It's crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. You can still taste the oozing cheese, so it was a nice start as an appetizer. There's a spicy tomato sauce at the top, which I didn't find it spicy at all.  It gave a bit of a sweet and sour feeling to it.  SALMON & SHRIMP W/AVOCADO PIZZA - interesting combination setup. The salmon and shrimp were cooked well. Wasabi mayo (I think) was added on as an extra sauce. Sounds weird how it's wasabi right? But it blended well - not a big problem for me, but subjective to others. If you like seafood in general, I think it's a good try.  GRANDMA'S MEATBALL SPAGHETTI - it also has Mozzarella & Parmesan Cheese added on with a few veggies. I've heard a lot of people like this item, but it was a little mediocre for me. Perhaps it was not as consistent. Some parts of the dish had too much cheese, and there was a tomato paste sauce that bland it out a little. The meatballs were fine and huge.   CHICKEN KARAAGE PIZZA - another interesting fusion setup. Chicken karaage is a Japanese style of fried chicken, topped with sweet corn and pineapple. There's also a bit of mayo as a sauce - so everything is on the sweeter side (a little typical for Asian-styled pizza). But the chicken tones the sweetness down. I actually really liked this pizza and I like how the chicken wasn't overly cooked/fried as well.  SEAFOOD LINGUINE WITH WHITE CREAM SAUCE - this dish has Parmesan Cheese, Shrimp, Hokkaido Scallop, Mussel and Squid. This was better than the Grandma's Meatball - but it didn't give me a wow factor. Everything blended well, and it did gave a very comforting home-food feeling for me.  OREO GREEN TEA CHEESE CAKE - highly recommended! The cheese flavor is very strong and rich. Loved how the green tea matched so well with the oreo, which served as a base. The cheese is also on a softer side, which personally fits to my tasting. It is a pretty heavy item, so make sure you save some room for dessert to try.   I think it's nice to have a new Italian fusion restaurant within the area. There's areas of improvement in terms of consistency and perhaps focus on a smaller set of menu items to start. I do see potential with the variety of combinations in the dishes and I can tell the Chef does put a lot of effort into creating these dishes. I would be interested to try their Fondue and other pastas (to see if there's a favourite I would like)."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night.   Pros: - Service has improved greatly!  - Food tastes good.   Cons: - Desserts are fairly expensive compared to the portion size."}
{"text":"I love cheese, I love Asian fusion food. The service was great, friendly and accommodating to dietary restrictions of my friends. However, I did not enjoy the shrimp tempura pizza as much as I thought I would! It was a bit too heavy.  The concept, the decor and service was great! I'd try another dish apart from the pizzas!"}
{"text":"I personally thought this place was so-so.   I had a high expectation because of the word \"cheese\" in its name,  but I was disappointed that the cheese did not taste particularly great.  I got very excited when I saw the stretchy mozzarella dangling on my slice of pizza,  but turned out I couldn't taste much of cheese other than seeing it.  I also ordered a spaghetti with yuzo and white sauce.  Somehow I thought the combination did not match too well together.   Overall,  this place was alright for a Chinese-japanese-western fusion cuisine. I would however not visit again as I did not find any dish I particularly like."}
{"text":"This was a real let down, and I'm not surprised it closed.  On top of a confusing menu selection, service was subpar. Our meal was prepared and delivered out of order and at different times. Our appetizers did not arrive until well after we had finished our main dishes. Kitchen needed to be better prepared and organized, or take on fewer tables.  Pastas and pizzas were generally enjoyed, but those appetizers were a flop. The corn seems like it was from a can or bag. The ribs with cheese were a sad literal 3 bones of mediocre flavoured and dry ribs with, I kid you not, a slightly melted kraft single \"cheese\" slice on top. What were they thinking?"}
{"text":"Rating - 2.5/5.0  I have been here three times in total, one of which was for a Yelp elite event. Just recently opened a couple months ago at Commerce Gate and taking over the spot where Grand Noodle used to be, this is a new cheese concept restaurant serving up items such as fusion cheese fondues, pasta dishes and various cheese derived desserts and appetizers.  This place would be a 3* if it weren't for their dismal service which still needs quite a bit of work even after a couple months from their opening. One particular waiter was quite incompetent on multiple occasions and always needed to either reach out to the manager or provide feedback that is not what I am looking for.  As well, now that they have a reservation system, they even fail to get customers seated at their designated reservation time. I recall one family having to wait 30 minutes past their reservation time. The manager made an excuse saying that the guests are still having dessert etc etc. As a business, you should be accounting for such cases already and include some buffer with your time slots. It is common sense.  Below are the items that I have tried along with their respective ratings:  [Cavetelli with Lamb Ragu - Rating: 2.5/5.0]   Was not a big fan of the chunks of lamb as it did not really complement well with the pasta and also a bit dry. As the dish claimed to be a ragu, I was expecting a meat based sauce but it was quite dry and tomatoey. Portion is quite big and could definitely be shared with two people.  [Black Truffle Carbonara Tagliatelle - Rating: 4.0/5.0]  The dish was prepared nicely and definitely a must order. The tagliatelle was perfectly al dente and had a fair amount of black truffle which complemented well with the creamy carbonara sauce. The smoked pancetta was aromatic and there was just the right amount of shaved parmesan to bring all the ingredients and flavours together.  [Grandma's Meatball Spaghetti - Rating: 3.0/5.0]   Again the portions are quite generous for this pasta dish. Nothing really outstanding and something you can definitely make at home. The meatballs were fairly decent compared with the rest of the dish.  [Arancini Balls with Spicy Tomato Sauce - Rating: 2.0/5.0]  Skip this one and definitely not worth your time trying. It was also not spicy at all.  [Japanese Seafood Spaghetti - Rating: 3.5/5.0]  I recall this one was quite creamy and saucy. The spaghetti however was a bit on the softer side. There was a decent amount of shrimp and the texture was bouncy. The fish roe also added another dimension of flavours and texture.  [Oreo Green Tea Cheese Cake - Rating: 3.5/5.0]  Not bad for what it is. Texture was dense and creamy at the same time with a decent amount of cheese flavour to go with the green tea.  [Shrimp Tempura Pizza - Rating: 2.5/5.0]  The pizza base felt store bought and more like a pita bread. Ingredients were creatively thought out but lacked execution. The tempura was room temperature and not crispy. Quite the contrary to BlogTO, these pizzas were not 'mindblowing'.  [Salmon & Shrimp Avocado Pizza - Rating: 2.0/5.0]  Same pizza base as the above except this one had salmon, shrimp avocado with wasabi mayo and cheese. Save your calorie intake for something else as this one was just underwhelming and basically tasted like a piece of cardboard with wasabi mayo on top.  Overall, they have a couple decent dishes and desserts/drinks. But there is a lot that needs to be improved if they want to be successful for the long term. Perhaps they need to scale down their menu so they can work on their craft before trying to be too ambitious."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for dinner and order the following  Cheese corn- instead of using a cheese sauce on top the corn seems like more of a very thick cream sauce and sprinkled with cheese on top then placed in the oven.   Baked muscle worst thing on the menu. Muscle was baked with some citrus jam and top like processed cheese slices that was cut up and baked- smh   Calamai came with fried jalapeno and cauliflower..... batter was not very crispy came soggy after a few min   Spaghetti and meatball - was pretty good, meatball was not dry seasoning was good   Truffle carbonara- I believe I saw truffle flakes on the menu picture but came with a scoop of truffle purée on top. Egg was kinda on the over cooked side. Flavour was good   Matcha cheesecake and parfait was decent"}
{"text":"Access Commerce Gate is great for parking if you come early.  Otherwise, I suggest that you park underground.  If you come at night on a weekend, start praying because there are no spots left by the time you arrive.  You can't really miss this big plaza as it is on Highway 7 (the restaurant is right beside Kinton Ramen).  Service I'm not sure if the place is run by only family members, but the servers genuinely care if you like their food.  They will give a warm welcome followed by detailed descriptions of the dishes that are offered in the restaurant.  Quite attentive but honestly lacking in staff, could do with more individuals working in the kitchen.    Food This is not your typical cheesy restaurant, I think it's definitely catered to the Asian family.  Please stay away from their slushies or whatever, they taste horrible and takes 30 minutes to make.  Just a big no from me.  I really enjoy their lunch specials because all meals come with an in-house drink, for us it was a lemonade.  I recommend getting their pizzas, you won't find salmon and avocado at your normal Pizza Pizza joint in GTA so try it here.  Their pasta isn't bad, mediocre at best.  Other stuff are average and forgettable, but nothing too horrible that would make me frown.  The menu is big so variety is a plus here.  Personally, I wouldn't come back for dinner based on the prices, but dining here for lunch sounds like a decent option."}
{"text":"Well, this place really lost in the Game of Cheese. They offered dishes that would normally have cheese on it (pasta, pizza) - nothing special or spectacular about the food. The ingredients used were subpar, at best. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had an interesting meal! The place is very cute with the cartoons and the service was alright.   Ordered the spaghetti (3/5) and the Shrimp Tempura Pizza (4/5)  The spaghetti was mediocre and the meatballs were too salty. I would not recommend getting this dish.  The Shrimp Tempura Pizza was very interesting! I liked this a lot better than the spaghetti and would like to come back to try the other pizza's.  They only accept cash!!"}
{"text":"I went there after reading from Yelp.  We had the Italian cheese fondue, meatball pasta and paella,  all of them are yummy.  I like that the fondue dinner let you to have unlimited refill noodles/rice/etc.  We only refilled twice though, I saw some table refilled like 4 times.  LOL.  The meatball pasta can do with less vegetable though.  Paella is yummy but not cheap.  Ambient is average.  Service is prompt and friendly.  Overall, I like the restaurant and would recommend others to give it a try."}
{"text":"Well, I went back with the kids because they love cheese, and it was a great experience. The kids loved all the food, and this time around, the service was great. I would highly recommend this place to anyone...except you have to remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear that another cheese themed restaurant was opening since melting pot disappeared from Richmond Hill.   It was still their soft opening when I went last week so they were working out a few kinks. The restaurant itself is very quirky with their decor. The menu I didn't find that professional since it was just laminated paper bound by a metal ring, this probably suggests they're changing items to see what works and what doesn't work during this period.  Lamb ragu - this dish was pretty average but lacked flavour and depth. It's okay if you have a pasta hangering but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat this.  Italian fondue - their fondue pots are very fusion, items you'd typically find in hot pot are served (corn on the cob, crab sticks, fish balls, mussels and clam) the only Italian influence is probably the cheese that's used. This dish also allowed you to choose your starch (macaroni, ramen, rice etc.) A bonus is that you get a free refill of your starch. As I was getting to the end of the pot the server asked if I wanted water to thin out the cheese, this was a very odd suggestion and makes me wonder if the restaurant really specializes in cheese because they'd know that would change the consistency of the texture and make it less palatable.  Service was friendly and attentive. The food portions are quite sizeable and will fill you up buy I find the concept to be too gimmicky and not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Shrimp Tempura Pizza came out fresh from the kitchen. This was delicious! The curry sauce at the bottom of the ingredients made the pizza flavours tie together into a definite fusion that I've never had before. It was so good. The tempura shrimps and crab meat were a great fit to the pizza too.  Chicken Karaage Pizza: I thought was a genius invention!  I love chicken karaage and to put it on a cheesy pizza was so smart!  I really liked the chicken karaage on top of the pizza; it was very nicely seasoned and in good sized pieces.  The pizza also contained some pineapple chunks with cheese and cream sauce.    The Yuzu Miso Cream Sauce Seafood Angel Hair Pasta was really good!  I would go back for this one.  I like angel hair pasta in general (I actually haven't had it in a long time) and this was done well with the seafood and cream sauce.  The seafood included tempura shrimp and  crabmeat again."}
{"text":"I love cheese. So when I found out there is a restaurant dedicated to cheese, I had to try.   1. Soy milk cheese fondue (more like hot pot) This is a bit sweet for my taste. Actually I think the fondue/hotpot would have been better without the cheese. To call it a fondue, there needs to be only cheese. That's why this is more like hot pot with added cheese to it.   2. Yuzu miso seafood spaghetti  This one is spot on! The yuzu flavour really comes out in the pasta. The seafood is nothing special: 3 pieces of imitation crabs, a few pieces of shrimp and clams. But the sauce makes this dish a hit.   3.  Grandma's meatball  The meatballs are nicely done. However, you can have spaghetti and meatballs anywhere. And you can even make them at home. So there is really nothing special about this dish. But at $11, it's a good pick if you want to just get your tummy full.   4. Pork ribs with cheese appetizer  There's 3 pieces of ribs. The flavour is nice. The meat is soft. Not a bad pick for $8  Service is decent. There are some servers that aren't too familiar with the menu and what is in each dish. This needs to be improved.   I hope they come up with new menu items. Because as of now, there's nothing else on the menu that is driving me to go back to try more."}
{"text":"First time trying out. Not bad for their Japanese seafood spaghetti with yuzu sauce. The appetizer -house special wasn't appealing to me. Both presentation and taste did not satisfy me."}
{"text":"I came here under the impression that there will be more cheese and cheese fondue options. The Black truffle Cabornara Tagliatelle $18.99 The flavour was nice as I like anything truffled. The short ribs with fries, the fries tasted worse than HK style Chinese cafe and the presentation can use a lot of work. I think I can make something look nicer than that..  My brother's girlfriend ordered shrimp linguine.  She said she liked it. Anyways as I was starring at the artwork with the cartoon had fondue and wine. Both of which was not available..  A little confused and disappointed about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad. It's a cool cheesy experience. Everything has cheese. Ambiance is casual. As soon as you walk in it just smells like cheese.  I came here on a Wednesday evening so seating was available immediately. Super quick and fast. The pasta I really like..  they cooked it just right where it's still chewy. Service was ok ... nothing exceptional but they were attentive enough. I mean, this isn't fine dining. So don't expect much ... it's overall good."}
{"text":"The menu is pricey but the dishes are mostly very creative, fusing together Italian dishes (pizza and pasta) with Japanese ingredients. Our group tried three different pizzas (kaarage, omurice, and tempura) and two different pastas (alfredo and yuzu miso) which were all good. The pizzas are far more impressive, however, in terms of presentation. The citrusy pasta was interesting but I wouldn't get it again. Decor is cheesy, in more ways than one. Service is a little understaffed but not terrible."}
{"text":"Game of Cheese has a cute concept where their main theme is cheese.   To start, staff was nice and friendly. Everyone was polite and attentive and would work as efficiently as possible.   Got baked mussels for app, but something happened cuz our entrees came way before these did and we waited a good hour for it with constant reminder. The dish itself was decent and I would get it again.  As with the entrees, we ordered the shrimp tempura pizza with curry base and the grandma's spaghetti and meatballs with cheese. I enjoyed the pizza. The curry base they used reminded me of curry from Japan. The tempura was ok but the flavours mixed well together. But after two slices I was already getting full due to the fact that the cheesiness and the curry made it heavy. The spaghetti was a miss for me. It was oily and taste wise was a typical spaghetti and meatball dish. The cheese wasn't as melty as I would've liked it but again dish was heavy from the cheese.  The highlight of my meal was definitely the green tea cheesecake! It came with a sorbet that was grainy in texture but paired with the soft creamy and light cheesecake, it worked very well together. I would come back for this cake on its own.  Overall the flavours were good but this restaurant would be a once in a while at most since the cheese really made me feel heavy afterwards haha."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a Friday night due to all the good reviews. My thoughts would be 3.5/5. They didn't have much options. As the name says it, every item is made with cheese. Clean environment, staff seem frazzled with the busy-ness. I tried grandmas meatballs, Italian fondue and seafood linguine with cream sauce. My favourite was the linguine. Sauce was rich and full of seafood (Hk style cream sauce) the meatballs were good however the sauce was nothing special. The fondue which I was looking forward to was disappointing. The heat they used went off before the pot was hot, had to ask for another one. The base was watery and flakey. There was a variety of seafood ( mushroom, tofu, spam, shrimp, mussel, fishball and veggies). For the price I didn't think it was worth it. They currently have a 10% discount for their soft opening!"}
{"text":"The place is very spacious and bright! Went during their soft opening so everything is pretty fair. I wish I tried the fondue, but I'll be back for it!   I tried the mushroom mac and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. However, I wish they added more mushrooms because I barely found any in my dish. Can't go wrong with mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Sorry this review may sound harsh but it's honest opinion. Was debating between a 2.5 and 3 stars for this one. I'm not even a cheese connoisseur and I wasn't impressed. Actually wanted to try their fondue but apparently they have discontinued it based on previous customers' feedback.  I applaud their bravery requesting for written feedback when we were presented with the bill, but then I thought they would read it here anyway.     We ordered the followings for the 2 of us and were full:  1. Special House Appetizer $4.99 - Arancini (crispy rice balls with cheese fillings). The tomato and cheese sauce with the rice balls reminded me of the taste you would get when you eat HK style pork cutlet with tomato sauce. So yeah, it was disappointing.      2. Baked Mussels $7.99 - it included 5 mussels baked with cheese and mayo. It tasted like those you would get at an AYCE buffet.    3. Seafood spaghetti with Yuzu cream sauce $13.99 - this was the best thing we had here. The yuzu zest made it refreshing, cream sauce was tasty, and it had crab roe, shrimp, fake crab meat. Decent portion. There's still a gap between this one and a pasta dish you would get from fusion places like Shiso Tree though.      Overall, the cooking felt very homemade - something you would be able to replicate if you tried it at home.  Friendly service though. For the current quality of food, maybe consider lowering the price to attract customers to sustain. OR use better quality ingredients and cheeses. It felt as if the chef tried randomly putting cheeses on top of things to see if they'd work.        Opening promotion 10% off. Must pay in cash."}
{"text":"This is quite a gem. There Asian fusion cuisine creative and delicious one of my personal favourites is the shrimp tempura pizza, the curry sauce has sweet notes while the shrimp and cheese offer a salty respite. The food quality is pretty consistent from all the times I have went. The wait staff are extremely polite a cut above the service staff at other restaurants in that area. The decor is fun and whimsical. All in all I have no complaints and always enjoy my time there."}
{"text":"Cute Asian fusion spot. To start, the baked mussels were delicious -- warm and super cheesy. For my entree, I ordered the Japanese seafood spaghetti with yuzu miso cream sauce. It was not bad, but also not too distinctive from a traditional seafood pasta. The portion size was not too big, which I appreciate because it left more room for dessert. They have a vast dessert selection on the menu, but were sold out of the yuzu sorbet when I visited. I ended up getting the yuzu cheesecake instead, which was a lovely take on traditional cheesecake. The yuzu flavour was subtle and light, and it complemented the cheese flavour nicely. I went with a friend on a weeknight when it wasn't too busy, and we chatted for several hours without getting kicked out. Cash and debit only. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Still a fan, but it's hit and miss. The chicken karaage pizza was delicious. The pork ribs with cheese were not porky or cheesy.  My aunt and I ordered the chicken karaage pizza and that was delicious. Melty, stringy cheese, crispy karaage, pineapple, and a surprisingly good pizza base. We both thought it was worth the price.   We also ordered the spicy pork ribs with mozzarella cheese. For $7.99, we got 3 pieces of rib with a little bit of grated mozzarella on top and a handful of fries. The fries were tasty, but I'm here for the ribs. The ribs themselves had very little meat on them and what meat there was was dry. Oh. Out of the three ribs, only two had cheese on them because the one at the bottom didn't catch any of the little cheese had been grated/placed on top.   For a place that calls itself Game of Cheese, if a dish has cheese in it, it'd better really be there. Otherwise, don't mention it. I still really like this place, and really enjoy the concept. However, I will not be getting the pork ribs again."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and ordered the specials - mushroom mac and cheese and kaarage pizza, $8.99 each with a drink. Prices on their regular menu seem to be fair to me.   Mushroom Mac and Cheese - very tasty, creamy with a lot of melted cheese (woo hoo!). Not a lot of mushrooms though. Expected more than the 5-6 chopped pieces we got given that mushroom was in the name. There was also a lot of bacon, which was not too salty and some cauliflower.   Pizza - also very tasty, lots of chicken, plenty of the other ingredients on a crispy thin crust.   Drinks came with our meals, we picked homemade lemonade and ginger ale. Waitress made a mistake and brought 2 lemonades, which didn't matter too much tbh. Very clearly not homemade though, I'm pretty sure it's the one you buy from Costco since I buy that a lot.  Not sure if anyone would really care if the drink is homemade, so that seems weird that it's written as such on the menu.   Portion sizes were really big, could easily have fed 3 people. We expected lunch sizes to be smaller than their regular menu, and were pleasantly surprised. Dishes took awhile to come out, but I think bc they have the skillets in the oven, but allow it to cool down when it comes out so you don't get burned. As such, the food was warm but not hot. I think if they had brought it out 5 minutes earlier it would be perfect.   Definitely would come again to try other stuff, because cheese."}
{"text":"I don't know why this is called game of cheese. There's very little cheese in the dishes. The pizza is ok. Lunch portions are small, but taste ok."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with a friend hoping to experience a variety of dishes with a heap load of different cheeses. We ordered the chicken karaage pizza, black truffle carbonara tagliatelle, and the Oreo green tea cheesecake. The pizza and pasta were both recommended by the waitress so we decided to try it. When the pizza came we were a little disappointed as there was barely any cheese on it, the chicken was good but we would definitely not order it again as the overall taste was lacking. The pasta was slightly better but again there was a lack of cheese. For a place that emphasizes the use of cheese I would expect every dishes to have an amazing cheese pull. My favourite was the cheesecake which had an Oreo base and mild green tea flavour.  The prices were reasonable but I would only return to try the other various desserts"}
{"text":"It was good fusion food. I got the shrimp tempura pizza and it was a fun combination of flavours. They had lunch specials that come with a drink so I would've gotten that because I was trying to pick between the chicken karaage pizza (one of the specials) and a the one I got, but it was good so it's no big deal. Anyways, the place was really clean and well lit, the bathroom was clean and even had a spray toilet (didn't bother trying to use it but it was cool) and the service was good too. So good lunch experience, I'll be back, and definitely for dessert some time."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on the weekend. The place was relatively empty the entire time I was there.   The service was good and the waitress was nice. She came to refill our waters several times and came to check up on us to ask how the food was.   I never got to try much on my visit. I only tried the Chicken Karaage Pizza ($12.99) and the Grandma's spaghetti ($10.99). I actually really like the taste of the chicken karaage pizza but I found the pizza hard to eat. The toppings were falling off when I tried to pick it up so I actually ate the majority of the toppings with a fork and then ate the pizza. Grandma's spaghetti was nothing special. I wasn't a big fan of the meatballs but it wasn't that bad a dish overall. I would recommend the chicken karaage pizza but not Grandma's spaghetti.   A friend had the mushroom mac and cheese ($10.99) and said it was good. I would maybe try it myself someday but I'm actually not a huge fan of mac and cheese. (Not sure if this is really worth mentioning but there is also cauliflower in this dish. So cauliflower haters beware!)  They have lunch specials that comes with a drink (never got to ask what drink it was) but the specials are only available on weekdays. The specials seem like a pretty good deal. They have the chicken karaage pizza on the lunch special menu for $10.99 while it is $12.99 on the normal menu.   Overall not a bad experience. I would return to try more menu items but am in no rush to come back."}
{"text":"1. Doesn't accept credit cards  2. Mediocre food, small portion 3. Extremely overpriced"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Friday after with a few of my friends. We ended up ordering the Grandma Spaghetti, chicken wings,  Italian sausage pasta and the green tea oreo cheesecake...for 3 people and 1 toddler...  It's an interesting restaurant,  they fusioned together Italian/western style with a lot of cheese...   The grandma spaghetti looked better than it tasted. The tomato sauce was bland, it was topped with mozzarella cheese, underneath the cheese, the sauce was tomato paste with water..2.5/5 Chicken wings were sliced into half wings as 2 pieces from one. So it didn't feel like there was really any meat on the wing. The flavours were average...3/5  The Italian sausage was probably the best tasting dish with significant amounts of cheese and the sauce was not bland, it was slightly thicker...4/5  Oreo cheesecake, was $8.99, a bit on the pricey side...small slice with a small homemade ice cream on top...it was thick and dense...   Overall, I would give this place a 3.2/5...I will come back to try other items on the menu but not in a hurry...."}
{"text":"We wanted to come here for a late lunch (around 3pm but unfortunately it was closed). Came back for dinner around 5pm.  I got the Japanese Seafood Spaghetti with Yuzu Miso Cream Sauce - 30% discount with a Yelp check in. The sauce itself was very creamy and the dish came with shrimp, beans, and corn. I don't think there was any immitation crab meat in my dish, unless it was mixed with my pasta (although the server said there would be). We also got free truffles from a Markham Food promotion which was nice (unfortunately the promotion ended today).  Overall, it was a good experience. The servers were friendly, the food came in a decent amount of time, and the wall decor was cute. I'd be interested in coming back here to try more of their pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Presentation was nice, service was great, but the food was mediocre. We ordered the cheese ribs ($7.99) as an appetizer. We were a bit disappointed that there was only 3 pieces, but even more disappointed when we bit into it and the meat was nowhere close to falling off the bone. We told the server that it needed more cooking time and she offered us a choice of another appetizer.  We got the mussels as our replacement. The mussels quality was good but the cheese melted on top was obviously processed cheese, which we scraped off. There were only 3 mussels as well for $7.99, and I wouldn't recommend it either. We ordered the seafood pizza, which was the only thing I liked. It had a good amount of salmon and shrimp and I liked the crust. The wasabi mayo was also nice but maybe didn't need so much.  The meatball pasta tasted like a typical spaghetti meatballs with cheese baked on but really wasn't anything special, the meatballs sorta tasted like the IKEA ones.  Overall I would've given 2 stars for the so-so food but I quite liked the service and the ambiance."}
{"text":"I first saw this restaurant on my way back to my Airbnb and it looked like it had an interesting concept. Did some research and found a video on it and it looked really good. Ordered the chicken karaage pizza and duck poutine which were different. However the chicken pizza came out first and the chicken itself made the pizza too soggy even though the crust was crispy. The entirety of the pizza was too creamy which made it hard to digest. Next we had the duck poutine which came out way later than it should have. About 15 min after our pizza came out, the appetizer finally came. When it arrived, there was barely any duck pieces and gravy. The fries were soggy as well.   Overall I would recommend trying it but definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I came here several times before I wrote this review.  I have mixed feelings here.   I was excited to come here because my friends raved about their cheese fondue, but they no longer sell it.    I find that the stuff on the menu is either hit or miss.   Meatball spaghetti was amazing. Good portion, good price and tastes good as well. The seafood pasta was great too.   Baked muscles were not fresh.  I can tell it has been frozen for quite sometime.  And the mushroom ravioli wasn't cooked properly, the outer layer had hard parts, from being frozen too long.   Never get the duck poutine. Cost 10$. Was basically frozen fries bought in Walmart, with 3 pieces of duck skin on top and some cheese and gravy.  Bland and boring.   Their desserts are really tasty, especially their sorbets.   Service is nice as well, the waiters r very attentive   THIS place is cash only, but they have an ATM at the front."}
{"text":"Note: I'm usually not a fan of ordering pastas because I get full quite easily (and I may or may not be a little biased for this review).   Finally ths place is open! I've seen it for quite some time whenever I'm on Hwy7 and I couldn't wait to see what Game of Cheese has to offer and they have a 10% off promo for their soft opening.   First and foremost I really wanted to try their fondue but I was full from my pasta and didn't feel like spending another roughly $20 on a fondue (quite expensive) when I'm not that hungry, but I'll definitely try this out another time.   I got the Four Cheese Sauce Gnocchi pasta and my aunt and cousin both ordered Grandma's Meatball Spaghetti. They were super cheesy (good if you're really into cheese!) and tasty. If I were to compare this to Italian pasta then this would kinda be meh but I actually quite enjoyed the fusion taste.   Service was good, there were so many people working so we ended up having lots of different people serving and helping us. The only downside to this place is that I found their menu to be limited on the variety. Besides the fondue and pasta, there weren't other mains to choose from...  Tbh I don't know how long this place will last 'cause the last time Toronto had something like this (The Melting Pot), it closed down :/"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night with my girlfriend and quickly got a table, but the place eventually got pretty busy. Cash only when I went. We ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and (I think) the Swiss Fondue Hot Pot.  The Spaghetti and Meatballs were pretty good. The meatballs are a good size, and they said they make them inhouse everyday. Flavour is pretty good. But what I came here to eat was the fondue.  The Fondue comes out over a small gel fuel fire, with your choice of a carb - rice, spaghetti or instant noodles, (and of course we chose the instant noodles) that you can refill as you eat through the hot pot. What was a little disappointing was the flavour of it. On the menu they mention several cheeses and seafood, but it ends up being more of just a pretty bland cream sauce. The seafood is just regular boiled, and you can't taste the cheese. I really wanted to like this. I thought the idea was really good, but the execution was just a little off.  The wait staff is friendly, and service is good."}
{"text":"I was using Yelp to make my reservation, got automated confirmation about 2hrs before my reservation.  Once we arrived the restaurant, we found out that they don't have our reservation at all.  They told us that they don't take reservation thru Yelp anymore.  However, their staff are very nice. They work around with their reservations, and give us a table as soon as they can.  And it was a Sunday evening.  I'm glad that the reservation option is finally take off from Yelp when I write this review.  I really like their food, especially their Asian inspired dishes: Chicken Karaage Pizza, Shrimp Tempura Pizza, Japanese Seafood Spaghetti, etc.  Their Japanese Seafood Spaghetti is my favourite dish~  Really love their Yuzu cream sauce!!  (However, I'm not very impressed with their Grandma's Meatball Spaghetti... Meh!!)  Must order their Fruit Slush, with your choice of Sorbet~  Love their sorbet, esp. Blood Orange Sorbet was amazing!!  Remember to save room for their Oreo Green Tea Cheese Cake.  It is very very good!!  Oero and green tea matched so well with cheese flavour~  Love it~!!!   Their staff are very nice, but this restaurant is absolutely understaffed!!!  All the waiters and waitress are non-stop working, running around with different things.  But we still have to help ourselves to get our own menu and cutlery set...  Cause they were way too busy... I hope their manager can hire more staff, unless they want to keep their slow service."}
{"text":"Cute interior design- they did really good in terms of service.   However, I think the food was still lacking. I would go for their desserts, but their pasta, or fondue (now removed off of menu) was okay- would not eat it again.  I know they continuously improve themselves which is good"}
{"text":"Took too long to arrive when you order the food !  One arrive the taste is great but not worth drooling over for!"}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant recently opened (previously it was Grand Noodle) by the same owners of Kaka all you can eat. Based on the menu, I would consider this a Japanese fusion restaurant. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the quality of food and service. We went for lunch and it had a steady flow of customers on Friday. A bigger group came in, and to re-arrange the tables, the server just dragged the table which was extremely loud and distracting. We went with the server's suggestion for food. We ordered the karaage chicken pizza. The pizza crust was hard and included canned pinapples. We also got the duck poutine which I think they used Costco fries. We had to ask them to heat it up since it was served cold. Lacked meat, sauce and cheese. Also, seemed like the duck was from a Chinese BBQ place. Lastly, we got the truffle pasta. Would prefer more truffle flavour and better quality noodle, but it was one of the better dishes we had. Hope to see some improvement so we can go back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with my family and I have to say I was pleased.  After seeing the bright exterior of the place I decided to check it out and found the interior just as bright and cute.   We ordered the following dishes  Cheesy sweet corn: I just really like corn and enjoyed it but I can say that the home of hot taste's cheese corn is a tad bit better. But its cheese corn you can not expect something absolutely outstanding.   Mac and Cheese: This was good, very cheesy and filling. I recommend sharing it as oppose to eating a whole portion because it gets quite heavy.   Seafood Linguini: My sister loved this one, it was lighter than the mac and cheese I found. Between the two I still would've ordered the mac and cheese again.  Korean Seaweed: This app was good the sauce was absolutely amazing. Worth sharing.   Duck Poutine: I found the concept amazing, and the duck was pretty good, I am personally not a fan of poutine to begin with but I do wish it was a bit cheesier and maybe more gravy.   Tempura Pizza: This by far was the best thing I ordered and I am excited to go back to try the Kaarage pizza. Its such a cool fusion dish and it tasted like a Takoyaki with a hint of curry. The tempura added a good crunch to the dish.  Absolutely amazing.   For dessert we ordered the carbon slush which I did not try, but I did try the snowball dessert which was very aesthetically pleasing. I found it refreshing and fun to eat, and the sorbet inside wasn't too sweet. There was other intriguing desserts that I would like to try next time.   The service was amazing, the staff constantly refilled water, checked to see if we were ok and it was a nice gesture to wipe the table before our dessert came. Keeping in mind the evening we went was a bit slow but regardless they were constantly doing something which from someone who works in the field I respect they did not crowd around the front just to talk.   Overall I would definitely come back, and would recommend it to those who like seeking new fusion food and being in a cute atmosphere.   **only takes cash or visa**"}
{"text":"I came here with my other half on Saturday around 9. The main dinner crowd was just clearing out when we came in, so we were seated right away.  The servers were all very friendly at first, but as time went on it seemed like we were starting to get ignored.  We ordered a swiss fondue with the mama meatballs and spaghetti. We also go carbon slush on the side as it's on special for $2.99 right now  The spaghetti came out in a large iron skillet, which really didn't seem to serve any other purpose then for presentation. It wasn't sizzling or anything else.   The meatballs wasn't anything that would blow you away, but were on the tastier side then not. It would be good if they were either larger, or made in house. The meatballs did not taste like they were \"home made\" in house.  The pasta itself was OK, but not quite al dente.  The carbon slush also was not anything amazing. It's basically ice on the bottom, a layer of fresh fruit, a slush of your flavor (guava etc.) and a scoop of ice cream on top. They also give you a can of sprite on the side. Even though we had two carbon slashed, they only gave us one can. The ice at the bottom was also not crushed, but had large chunks. So really you couldn't slurp anything out below the layer of fruit. Once everything melted and was mixed together it tasted good, but not sure why the fancy wording of \"carbon\" slush.  The fondue itself was a small to medium size. The base broth was very tasty, but not sure if I could say I tasted all the listed cheeses. The interesting thing is that the \"carbs\" are unlimited. So you can order as many extra bowls of rice, instant noodles, noodles, spaghetti and macaroni in any variation. Weird thing is that they only allow you to order ONE bowl of carb per order. So one bowl was shared between two of us each time. Not sure why the limit really.  Based on the service I would give this place closer to 3.5. But just based on the food we had, it's a very solid 3.   They do seem to have an extensive menu, so maybe there are other items that would make this place a regular spot for me. But based on the food I had, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more when I came here.    Decor and presentation is on point! Super cute and Social media worthy of your looking to share with others. Unfortunately can't say the same for the food.   Grandmas Meatball Spaghetti - overly salty and the cheese wasn't fresh. You can tell because it was all clumped together and didn't taste good. I did like the sizzling plate which was a nice touch ($11.99)  Black Truffle Carbonara Tagiatelle - pasta didn't taste good and you couldn't even tell there was black truffle. This dish was the most disappointing.   Overall, I won't be coming back unless I hear from friends that it get better.   2 star rating because the decor and presentation of the food was great"}
{"text":"Came on a weekday around 7. Restaurant was quit empty.  Ordered a duck poutine appetizer, grandmas spaghetti and meatballs and the Swiss cheese fondue.  The best was the poutine the spaghetti was a bit too tomatoey but the meatballs were tasty. As for the main Swiss cheese fondue.... i feel like it didn't taste like fondue at all. It just tastes like a cream sauce. If you didn't put the cheese they provide you, you wouldn't know there was any cheese in it. I was looking forward to this but it was a disappointment.  Service was okay. They provided water in take out cups with lid which I find a bit weird as I'm eating in and not take out."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I think there's good potential for this place. My parents mentioned that the winter menu is different in which they offer fondue? If so I would love to give that a try if I'm back around that time.  Anyway, went here for dinner with a couple of friends during my week back in the city. The restaurant says it all; cheese cheese and more cheese. There's a selection range of pasta options, pizza, and some burger steaks (similar to Aka Teppan). I'd say the menu choices are pretty good, and there should be something for everyone if you're into Asian fusion (and cheese).  I had the Japanese seafood spaghetti with yuzu cream sauce, while my friends had the four cheese pizza and mushroom mac n cheese. Both my friends loved their meals and had absolutely no complaints at all. As for myself, I unfortunately felt it was nothing special, especially considering the price paid. Perhaps it was a bit too \"safe\" of a dish, since it's not exactly the cheese-iest option on the menu. I'd definitely pick something else though if anything.  Service was quick, but efficient and well attentive. It's as good as it gets for Asian restaurants.  I'll probably return but won't order the same item. Perhaps a winter visit to the GTA for some fondue?"}
{"text":"- price is reasonable - very attentive - food is flavourful  - got the spaghetti meatball - worth it, meatballs were perfect  - got the chicken pizza - chicken was nice n crispy"}
{"text":"Came to Game Of Cheese and got the Seafood Linguine w/ White Cream Sauce and the Hamburger Beef Steak With Rice (not pictured).   Let me start of with saying: don't get the Hamburger Beef Steak. It's an absolute rip-off. The price you pay definitely does NOT reflect how much you're given on the plate and the quality of the food. Wayyyyyyy overpriced. The burger itself is dry, over-seasoned and just disgusting with BARELY any sauce on the plate. The only saving grace was the cheese on top of the burger.  The Seafood Linguine w/ White Cream Sauce was a tad bit better (warranting the extra star, bumping this rating from a 1-star to 2-star review), as the sauce actually is not that bad and it's full of seafood. Unlike the Hamburger Beef Steak, you're actually getting your money's worth.  Service isn't awesome here. We waited at our table for a good 15mins until someone came to take our order (even though we asked the waitresses passing by MULTIPLE times if we could order, yet they're answer was always \"wait a moment\", yet we waiting many many many many moments). Food is slow coming out of the kitchen.   TL;DR: If you're in a rush, definitely don't consider this establishment. Food is mediocre (nothing spectacular); some worth the price, some definitely not."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, filling and reasonably priced. My girlfriend and I tried the shrimp tempura pizza, seafood omurice pizza, cheesy sweet corn, and the oreo green tea cheesecake. Both pizzas were prepared well and served fresh, as well as the appetizer.   The omurice pizza is your best bang for your buck, in my opinion, because you get the most weight of food per dollar.   The shrimp tempura is a signature dish and for good reason; it tasted like Japanese curry, which mixed well with the cheese, shrimp tempura and crab meat.   I would order the pizzas again next visit, but would look to try another appetizer because the cheesy sweet corn was nothing special.   Lastly, I would absolutely recommend their Oreo green tea cheesecake. Everything about it is goldilocks - not too sweet, not tasteless. Not too hard, not too soft, etc. The Oreo crust really stood out, yet simultaneously complementing the Cheesecake perfectly. It was a mixture of flavours I would have never imagined would be so good.  Overall, the quality of the food is superb. However, the service was slow as there was only 1 server waiting for every table in the establishment. She was very busy, so it was understandable because 1 person can only do so much. I also noticed that the order receipt for each food would be resting on top of the food itself when the server brings the food out from the kitchen, which makes me wonder if it's clean to do so.   My only legitimate complaint I had with my experience at Game of Cheese was that our appetizer was given to us after we finished our meals. This was very confusing as I don't believe adding cheese to sweet corn in a pan would take longer than making a pizza.  I would definitely recommend the restaurant because of the food, but be prepared to play Game of Patience at Game of Cheese."}
{"text":"Lunch out with colleagues to try out this place. Total of 11 people. Made reservation at 12:30 , when we arrived the table is ready. Place not that busy. There were only 2 servers and its hard to get their attention as they are all the way back most of the time. Once you get their attention they are fast and friendly to serve you.  Ordered 3 items to share....  the Black truffle carbonara 18.99. Flavor is good, notice some mushroom and bacon, with egg on top, good we decided to share, I can't finish on my own, too rich. Lunch special Hamburger Chicken steak with Yakiniku sauce on a hot plate. 10.99 with a choice of pop or house drink. Thick patty with sauce and slice of cheese on top. Just ok. What I enjoyed is the tempura shrimp pizza. It has curry, jap mayo, tempura shrimp, crab stick, bonito flakes, few corn and yakiniku sauce. Taste so good. Love the mixture and curry taste. 13.99 10\" size.  My friend had the shrimp linguine lunch special, Tomato based with several pieces of large size shrimp. 10.99 included in the lunch special menu. I did try it and taste not bad for me . But for her, She wanted to add some parmesan cheese, requested it but was told to pay extra as side order. Very disappointing. Who would want to order a side order of parmesan cheese?!? Didn't fit to have cheese as the name of the place.  There were a lot of interesting items on the menu. Intrigue on how good the parfait tastes, they all look yummy. Will give it a try next time. With the experience today, it will be awhile til I decided to come back."}
{"text":"With the cute little characters and interesting name, I was intrigued when I first noticed it being under construction. Once it opened, it was expected that I saw posts all over instagram.  We had a large party and were able to make a reservation.  Here's a brief review of the things I tried:  Duck poutine (10.99) - this was an absolute joke. I am embarrassed for Game of Cheese to be serving a tiny plate of fries with a PINCH of duck and a few drops of gravy. I noticed this place has no QC at all as another table next to us had almost triple the amount of duck and gravy on the fries.  Mushroom Mac and Cheese (10.99) - this was quite delicious, although I wouldn't emphasize the mushroom part. There were maybe 5 pieces of mushroom, random baby carrots here and there.. the taste was good though.. then again.. it's just macaroni..and cheese.  Orecchiette with Italian Sausage - Overcooked pasta, tomato sauce, Italian sausage and some cheese thrown on top.. nothing special.  Corn & cheese appetizer - self explanatory... this one was pretty decent, sweet corn with a ton of butter and cheese.  Oreo matcha cheesecake: The oreo bottom and the matcha top was good. the room temp mushy cheesecake with green food coloring was meh.  Guava carbon slush (5.99) - for the promotional price of 2.99.. I will enjoyed this. The slush had almond tofu on the bottom..with canned fruits and Guava slush.   Overall: For a restaurant that prides themselves in specializing in cheese... I could not point out a single dish that stood out to me..nor one single type of cheese that paired well with the food. We also noticed that our food arrived just warm as opposed to other tables that had steam coming from their dishes.  The service was great and staff were very friendly. The decor and tableware were all very instagram worthy."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch.  Service was excellent, always check for satisfaction.   Three Lunch set came with drinks but we upgraded to Slush which was super delicious!  We liked the innovative dishes made from different kind of cheese.... Tempura pizza , Korean seafood Omurice etc.   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Don't get fooled by that BlogTO post. I was really hoping for a cheese overload but sadly it was not delivered. My mushroom pizza was worse than buffet pizza. I think that's saying a lot. There was supposedly to be goat cheese on the pizza but I could hardly taste it. It must have only been a light dusting versus cuts of goat cheese. There was literally only one type of mushroom. Your plain old white button mushroom. The crust was extremely bland. The dessert sampler platter was very visually pretty. This was decent if you like chocolate although thought not on theme with the cheese. The waitresses were very slow on this occasion even though we were eating at an off-peak time. It took them a long time to do any task - clear tables, bring napkins or cutlery, pack the to go box, get the bill. Cool restaurant concept and ambiance but not worth it because of the food."}
{"text":"Please note. This is 3.5 stars as Yelp doesn't offer half star-rating (really Yelp? in 2017?).  Found this place out from BlogTO, so went with a couple of friends.  My review will be all over the place as you read further down.    This place is alright.  I would come back, but I would say that they need work with their wait staff, either they're really short-staffed, or better organization perhaps....  And it kills me to say this because the food that they serve is actually really good.    Called for reservation, had no issue, was 5 minutes late, but was seated right away.  In terms of service, I think once we were seated, no one approached us until we had to flag someone down to start ordering.  When we ordered, I asked if we could have 3 separate bills divided, she complied but then came back and said...\"you might need to tell the waiter who's getting your bill, to make it happen, just in case\".   I found that was kind of weird, but I wasn't too bothered by it, but it kind of felt like that she was taking orders from a table that didn't belong to her.  *shrug* No biggie.  The more concerning part of being there was more on the wait time as they took...really long to get our food, like I think we waited anywhere between 45 minutes-1 hour.  And I could have sworn that I saw tables who came later than we did, and getting their food served before us.  On top of that, we didn't get our 3 dishes at the same time.  Thankfully my friends and I were sharing everything, so it wasn't a huge deal, but it just doesn't bode well service wise.    Now the food.  Hot damn.  If their service could match the food they put out, I'd come way more frequently.  Also the prices are reasonable too.  The most expensive dish that we bought came in at around $18.99 (the Black Truffle Carbonara with the poached egg), most generic pasta dishes are typically around that price but the ingredients aren't as...great?.  We ordered 3 items, the Carbonara, the 4 cheese pizza (with argula/walnuts) and the yuzu seafood spaghetti.    The rather ironic thing was that the Carbonara (even at its price) was my least fav dish out of the 3.  The carbonara was too heavy/rich (still tasted really good), but I thought the seafood spaghetti was amazing.  It's a cream-miso based sauce, but the yuzu cuts through richness of the dish and it's really delectable.  Seafood is well cooked, and the overall dish looks really bright and visually appealing to eat.  I'd gladly order that again.  4-cheese pizza was really good too, nice thin crust, with a fig jam on it and really tasty.  Unfortunately because of what we ordered we were way too full for desserts, so while I wasn't crazy about the service, it hasn't deterred me from coming back.    Overall, great food, great prices, shaky service.  Oh just fyi, they only accept debit/cash."}
{"text":"Was here as we were curious. It was spacious enough to fit our huge stroller and surprisingly wasn't that busy on a weekday.   Tried the Japanese Style Seafood with Yuzu Miso Cream. The aroma was incredible, but overall, I thought it was a bit bland and could probably use more cheese along with seafood!   Parking wasn't too bad but it would be horrendous on weekends. Try underground."}
{"text":"This was by far one of my most stressful meal experiences. ***This review is largely based on my dissatisfaction towards their management. Tasty food is important but if management is poor, it's highly unlikely that I'll return***    My colleagues and I visited on a Friday for lunch at noon, and during this peak time of the week, they appeared quite short handed. With only two servers on the floor, they were overwhelmed with taking orders, cleaning the tables, serving food, refilling water, attending to new customers by the door and getting the bills. But kudos to the male server who did everything and remained friendly and positive!   The kitchen must've had only one cook because everyone's food took forever! At 12:55, close to 40min after ordering, one of our two pan oven pizza came but we were still waiting on the other pizza and a mac and cheese dish. We had no time to eat! At 1:05, the server had to pack our pending orders straight from the kitchen into take out boxes. In a rush to get back to work, we left the restaurant with food in our mouths, half a slice of pizza in our hand and bags of take-out boxes. For a business that's running for a few months now, and a restaurant this size, serving \"fancy\" lunch menus, would you not have prepped the food in advance and anticipate the number of customers!? No idea what was going on in the kitchen but that was horrible time management!!   I don't have much to say about the food except the karaage pizza was an interesting fusion of Japanese and Western style. It had onion, seaweed, pineapple, chicken karaage, cheese, teriyaki sauce and mayo. The lunch combos come with a pop or special housemade drink- which is lemonade. At least the lemonade arrived quickly and tasted good. The mac and cheese wasn't special and lacked mushrooms and bacon. Also I'm sure it would've tasted better on the skillet rather than a take out box and although I want to try their cheese fondue and desserts, i won't be back until they have time to improve."}
{"text":"The black truffle carbonara was amazing and is 4.5 out of 5.  We tried the chicken karaage pizza and it was a huge disappointment. The flavours didn't blend well together. Also they ran out of a dessert we really wanted to try. I will definitely come back because the staff was really nice and the menu selection is great."}
{"text":"Although I was satisfied with the service and the cleanliness of this restaurant, they really need to step up their food game. My friend and I shared the chicken karaage pizza and seafood pasta with yuzu sauce. The pizza was a bit of a disappointment because the chicken and pizza turned out to be an odd combination. I feel like they bought the chicken from somewhere and just put them on top of a pizza dough without considering the overall flavour. However, the yuzu sauce paired well with the pasta and seafood."}
{"text":"Food - It's alright. As most people said it's very homemade. They all come in a skillet to keep the food hot.  Dessert takes a while to come but they are beautiful and tasty  Service - Excellent and helpful"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed both trips to Game of Cheese. The first time I went I got the shrimp linguine, and the second time I went I got the ricotta ravioli.   Maybe these are just \"safe\" dishes that aren't overly cheese-y, but I really enjoyed them. The food quality is fresh, flavourful, and very reasonably priced.   I have yet to try the omurice pizza, which is next on my list. I'll definitely be back to Game of Cheese soon!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this cute restaurant out and am quite impressed with everything!  First of all, the decor is so adorable! Love the little cartoon cheeses!  Food wise, at first I found the prices quite high but the quality of the food is definitely there. Everything is made fresh and in house. The pastas were all super cheesy and very yummy! The portions are big too!  I really enjoyed the Grandma's meatball spaghetti, it's not your regular meatballs but a blend of chicken and pork! The seafood linguine tasted good and had a lot of seafood but was a little bit too thick for my own tastes.   For dessert I had the Snowball, which is a meringue enclosed over a sorbet with a house made strawberry sauce poured over top. Ideally the meringue case was supposed to crack open with a spoon but it was too frozen LOL. Nonetheless, the idea was there and it's a very unique dessert. The meringue was very tasty but I thought that the sweetness from the strawberry sauce was too overwhelming.  Service wise, I had a lovely waiter to serve me. His name is Jeremy I believe. He was very knowledgeable on the dishes and gave wonderful recommendations to me. He was very friendly and attentive, making sure that we have everything we need and frequently filling up our waters!   Overall, I love the whole theme of this restaurant and the food it serves. Hopefully after their soft opening there will be more variety in their menu. Looking forward to trying all the other cheesy dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Decor was nice. I came in with low expectations as I kinda knew it would be more of a gimmick restaurant.  Coming here, of course you have to try the featured cheese fondue. They have quite interesting flavors, I decided to go with the Laksa Cheese pot ($14.99) This was disappointing. Not sure if it was because it was Laksa flavor so it was a soupy base, but essentially this is a cheese pot and not cheese fondue as the menu claims it to be. They serve a laksa soup pot with all the included ingredients cooked inside with a few slices of cheese on top. It does come with a separate bowl of shredded cheese for you to pour it into the pot to stir with all the inside ingredients. Regardless the cheese and soup ratio isnt comparable for it to become a form of cheese fondue style. None of that oosey cheese strings that you'd expect to see. On the bright side there were actually a decent amount of ingredients inside - the laksa was essentially seafood, featured 4 piece of shrimp, a mix of mussels, clams, cabbage, corn, mushroom, squid balls, tofu, and a selection of noodles. The bonus is noodles have free refills, but keep in mind their refill bowl is less than half of the first noodles' serving.  Cavatelli with Lamb Ragu ($12.99) Portion-wise it was really big, but there weren't actually that many lamb pieces inside. I didn't mind the cavatelli pasta, it was actually my first time trying this type of pasta - sort of like a hard shelled curvy pasta. Sauce and flavors were good, nothing special. The dish looked quite cheesy, but in reality it didn't taste overly cheesy and was a normal amount.  The food was okay, but nothing special nor the kind of restaurant I feel like I'd want to come back. Tried it once so I'm good. Menu prices are slightly expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp for check in discount.  Ordered:  Cheesy sweet corn. Exactly what you would expect. sweet corn covered in hot melted cheese. yummm.  Japanese seafood spaghetti with yuzu miso cream sauce. Nice saucy pasta, can taste the tang from the yuzu.   Oreo Greentea Cheese Cake Not as strong in green tea flavour as it looks, which i like because i'm not huge on green tea.  Yuzu Cheese Cake again has that nice yuzu tangyness to it  3 hour slowly baked creamy cheese cake, berry compote, yoghurt sorbet not kidding when they say is creamy. very small portion.  Soya bean ice cream tastes like soya milk that was frozen."}
{"text":"I had some expectations for this place because I love cheese but I also knew to keep them grounded because of the reviews I've seen on Yelp so far. In brief, I was quite disappointed.  Management: Pretty simple when you walk in and you get seated by a server. I was very scared when I saw the ATM machine because there was no sign whatsoever that this was a cash only place - it's a cash only place. Thankfully my friend had cash, but because I forgot to read the tips for this restaurant - I had to borrow money :c  Service: Our server wasn't rude or anything, but her English wasn't the best. I was trying to ask her what the matcha tasting bowl was and she kept describing a hot pot or an udon and my friend and I were just so confused - I was even pointing at what I was inquiring about. Finally, she said that they didn't carry it but I said I just wanted to know what it was, so she just stood there awkwardly until I asked her to ask the manager for me what it was. The only good thing about that was that her manager said they didn't carry it but could make it for me. I passed.  Cleanliness: The place was fairly clean and nothing sticky was on the tables or floors so there are no complaints here.  I tried the following:  1. Baked Mussels ($7.99): These are green muscles topped with avocados and rich cream sauce. It came with a crust of, what I believe are, potatoes. It looked visually appealing but when I tried to eat it, the potatoes came right off the mussel, taking along with it, all the toppings. Unless I ate the whole mussel in one bite, I had to eat the mussel separately from the toppings. The flavours were generally confusing - nothing was complimenting one another and the mussel has to be chewed on vigorously before swallowing.  2. Grandma's Meatball & Spaghetti with Mozzarella & Parmesan Cheese ($10.99): The description said homemade beef meatballs and tomato sauce. When we bit into the meatball, it was immediately reminiscent of the frozen meatballs you can get out of a box. The pasta was okay, but you can't really go wrong with the pasta. My friend's comment was that she just didn't want to finish it because it wasn't appetizing at all.  3. Hamburger Beef Steak ($8.99 lunch special price): This came with either a pop or a homemade lemonade and I chose the lemonade - they pre-mix it so you can't ask for no sugar and/or other modifications and that's also why it came out so quickly. My meal came in a hot skillet they ask you not to touch and I chose a mushroom cream sauce to go with it. I didn't have any of the rice, but I did finish the green vegetables it came with. The beef steak and its sauce... dry even with the sauce and the sauce tasted like someone accidentally tipped a salt shaker in because it was SO salty. I couldn't finish the steak with its sauce.   4. Signature Pistachio Ice Cream ($8.99): This was something I was looking forward to the most because I love a good homemade pistachio because the flavour is so strong. However, when it was served to us, we could tell right away that they had prepared it earlier and just froze it along with the cup. We could still see the frozen ice on the cup and on the top of the ice cream. After we finally ice-picked our way into the ice cream, all I could taste was the white chocolate curls and the strawberries. I couldn't find the pistachio taste for the life of me. After 2 bites, we just left that dessert there to thaw.   5. Oreo Green Tea Cheesecake ($7.99): We wanted to try another dessert and the server suggested this as their most popular item. I have learned not to expect too much matcha flavour whenever it's combined with another flavour but this was probably the worst disappointment. The texture of the cheesecake was not bad but the only flavour I could taste was the oreo crust and cheese. No matcha. It was clearly green from something, but it wasn't the green tea. It also comes with a sorbet of the day and it was a lychee flavour. The lychee flavour, in no way whatsoever, complimented the dish. Not only did it look unappetizing because it resembled bug spit, but it wasn't a fantastic texture either. The lychee flavour itself wasn't too bad.   Needless to say that I'm not going to come again. The up side was that I didn't experience the same wait that my fellow yelpers did, but that was probably because it was a Tuesday afternoon where we were 1 of 2 tables - I would hope the food comes quickly. I came to test if the reviews were right about this place and they were spot-on."}
{"text":"Came here once, and I don't love it but I don't hate it either. The interior was decorated nicely - it was cute and had an interesting wall design. The staff was friendly, but a bit slow.   As you would expect based on the name of the restaurant, everything on the menu had cheese on it. There were a lot of interesting things and contained a lot of Asian fusion foods, however when we came, they said they ran out of a few ingredients which limited our choices. In the end, I got a cheeseburger sizzling plate (or something like that), which came late. It tasted good, but the portion size was small - surprising, since it was a bit pricey for what you get.  Overall, it was okay. Would come back to try more things.. hopefully they have all their ingredients next time!"}
{"text":"Game of Cheese might need to improve on their game plan especially for lunch.  I love pasta and I love Japanese fusion. Shiso Tree Cafe is one of the successful example in GTA. Game of Cheese's concept of blending the 2 together is quite promising.  Dropped by for lunch around 2:00 pm. The restaurant was empty and I was the only one there for a late lunch. Service as expected was excellent!  Menu choice is huge. I would suggest trim down on the choice and have some signature dish. I was a little overwhelmed and it took me a little while to decide what to order.  Japanese Seafood Spaghetti with Yuzu Miso Cream Sauce ($13.99) - Yuzu Miso is a good combination, the sauce is tasty as the tanginess of yuzu balance out the creaminess of the cream sauce - seafood was weak..  frozen squid ring and imitated crab stick?! But I do like the fish roe that gave the dish that savory contrast and texture  There was no lunch special back in June but with 10% off. But I think they now have lunch special set. Maybe I will go check that out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, server was very nice and helpful. Highly recommend the chicken karaage pizza, it's amazing and unique"}
{"text":"Catching up with my university friends, we decided to visit Game of Cheese.   Highlights include very cute decor with an interesting selection of comfort food that is an Italian fusion with Korean and Japanese flair.   We ordered the Grandma's meatball pasta, shrimp tempura pizza, mango fruit slush with the lychee sorbet option, and Koji fried chicken. The pasta was okay, with loaded with cheese, but left the impression of being simple enough that I could make at home. The pizza was a very interesting fusion dish, with curry paste instead of the tomato sauce base which seemed to marry well with the cheese and the tempura shrimp, as well as the crunchy pita-like crust---the imitation crab, however, was off-putting. The mango slush was excellent with strong mango flavour, amongst other fruit, with the strangely concentrated pineapple at the bottom of the drink. Our favourite of the bunch was the Koji fried chicken: well-executed with the crispy exterior and the succulent meat.   Overall, an interesting meal. May pay another visit pending new featured items."}
{"text":"Food quality is extremely bad... we ordered kimchi pot and spicy pork rib with mozzarella cheese... they didn't put enuf ingredients in the kimchi pot. U can definitely cook a better one at home wif a way cheaper price. The ribs are super bad.. u can taste it's frozen food. Service quality is just so so. Bad experience."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that Game of Cheese isn't rated higher on Yelp! Came here at 9:45pm on Tuesday night. We were seated right away and told that kitchen last call was at 9:50pm but they never really rushed us to order. Waitress was super friendly and accommodating and the drinks and food came quickly.   Drinks are super yummy!!!! And... the food was absolutely DELICIOUS. We ordered Grandmas Meatballs, Seafood Linguine, and Truffle Pasta. Hit the spot perfectly!!! It was a good portion - just enough to get us full. The creamy pastas weren't too heavy but just the right amount of richness and creamy flavour to get a feel of comfort food.  The truffle was great with the egg for the lovely umami flavour. The next day the same party I went with to Game of Cheese even commented the pasta was way better in terms of flavour and portion at Game of Cheese than Joeys (and similar price point).   Despite being the last customers, they never rushed us out and patiently waited for us to finish enjoying our meals. I couldn't finish my drink, so I asked the waitress to put it in a to go container.   The decor was super cute - everything was cheese themed!  Highly recommend Game of Cheese and I'll totally go back! Excited to try other dishes."}
{"text":"By the name of the restaurant , I would expect a adventure of Cheese, and I love cheese. We ordered 2 appetizer, one is the mussels with cheddar cheese, very home-make style. We also ordered one pizza and one pasta.  Salmon & shrimp w/avocado pizza, nothing wrong with what goes on the topping, but the pan-crust is a huge disappointment. We asked the server, if the pan crust is fresh made, first he answered yes, then he double checked with the kitchen, they bought it. The pizza is a joke, worst than pizza pizza. We also ordered grandma's meatball spaghetti, we all laughed at the size of the meatball, and again very disappointed!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg found this new place in Markham and loved it!  Loved the food and the service.  Their matcha sorbet is the bomb especially cus it's homemade.  Some other faves are seaweed rolls and the mushroom pizza.  Even though everything has cheese in the menu you don't get sick of eating cheese which is good!  Also the staff is super friendly!!  A must try for sure cus you won't regret."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE unless you are prepared to be disappointed! This place claims to have a wide variety of dishes according to their website menu. However, in reality, they have a very limited of dishes. Even attempting to order off the existing menu was disappointing. Many main dishes and desserts weren't available due to the fact that they are \"in the process\" of changing their menu to the one online. There are no omurices, risottos, fondues or udons available.   Service was terrible. No acknowledgement of guests arriving and we sat and grabbed our own menus. No water/cutlery given until asked. Definitely not worth going. DO NOT GO THERE AT ANY COSTS!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Game of Cheese on Victoria Day, despite the holiday it was open! When we both entered we were seated quickly. The whole restaurant is decorated in cute cartoon murals of cheese characters, which was cute :) I had the grandma's meat ball spaghetti, it was cheesy but a bit too salty the meat balls had a nice bite to them. Service here was surprisingly good and attentive. I would recommend this place to people, super cute theme and yummy food, I want to try the fondue next time!"}
{"text":"came here on a sunday night and it was pretty quiet.   Decor and renovation are nice and interesting, however the food is just not for my liking. I believe it is supposed to be japanese/italian fushion, but it just does not taste good. I will not return.  I ordered the seafood yuzu pasta. I wasn't expecting a lot of seafood, but imitation crab meat was counted as part of the seafood, which i did not expect.   Star for the creativity and renovation."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I ordered the chicken karaage pizza, which was delightful. I would definitely recommend the dish. Décor and designs within the restaurant were also very interesting and different. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"IT HAS FINALLY OPENED!!! The mysterious Game of Cheese has been getting built for the last few months and they have opened their doors to the public. For grand opening, they have a 10% off your entire bill!  WHAT IS IT??? I asked this question too. Basically their menu is focused on cheese dishes and Asian fusion, so pastas such as gnocchi and spaghetti, but also cheese \"fondue\" hot pot style. I have actually never tried it this way so I was mega confused, but the employees helped us explain it and they were nice about it. We ordered the Italian Cheese Fondue and it's basically the same concept as hot pot but with a cheese flavor. It was quite mild and different from what I've experienced before, but I quite enjoyed it. It also comes with unlimited carbs of your choice. We went with instant noodles. This was 18.99, which I found a little bit pricey, but the experience was cool.   We also ordered the Grandmas Meatball Spaghetti which I LOVED!!! The cheese flavor was nice and the portion was large. I wish there was a bit more veggies and a tomato taste, but I still really enjoyed it. The price was 10.99, which I found the value was really good for this dish as it was plentiful and the meatballs were super good. Super recommend.   If you're coming as a group of two people I suggest having a pasta dish and also a fondue as well. When you're waiting for the fondue to cook, you can munch away on the pasta and it gives a nice balance so you don't have to wait so much. I haven't even touched the desserts. There were so many that I wanted to try and they also have handmade ice cream. Ahhh!!   In conclusion, THE GAME WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AND I WILL COME BACK! 6/5."}
{"text":"Good interior and good service. Ordered three dishes, grandma's meatball pasta is awesome, my four year old ate half of it. Seafood pasta is also great but a bit too heavy on the sauce, good amount if seafood unlike some other places. The chicken pineapple pizza is very unique and also surprisingly good . Overall very satisfied with this place. Waiters are very nice and helpful and friendly with kids"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Western-Asian fusion dishes with a focus on delivering cheesiness. I was anticipating its opening and finally had a chance to check it out today.   I arrived at the beginning of their dinner shift, so the restaurant was just re-opening for the day. I started out with the baked mussels. They were pretty good, with a nice amount of cheese, but I wish that they had a little bit more salt in order to really bring out the flavour of the mussel.   The karaage pizza arrived pretty quickly after the mussels. This was probably the best dish that I had. The crust was thin and perfectly crisp while the okonomiyaki sauce and bonito flakes perfect complimented the fried chicken. The only slight criticism I have is that it should be renamed as a \"Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken Pizza\" - especially since you can get incredible karaage next door.   Last but not least was the Grandma's spaghetti. Extra cheese was also added, mimicking the raclette trend from last year. However, for the price, the extra cheese portion was quite small, and didn't melt nicely into the spaghetti. The chefs should considering adding the extra cheese right after so that it doesn't awkwardly clump up the noodles. While the meatballs were pretty good, this dish wasn't anything special. Again, it tastes like something I could make at home and it was light on the salt.   They now accept debit and there doesn't seem to be any fondue offerings on the menu. Strange, since that dish might've been one of their more exciting offerings.   Service was nice and the staff were friendly. Otherwise, the meal was quite average overall."}
{"text":"I was here last night, staff is friendly and provide good service.  We ordered mushroom mac and cheese, chicken hamburg steak on rice, and some pasta dish i cant remember.  The mushroom mac and cheese was tasty, not overly salty and toasted with some parmesan cheese on too.  The chicken hamburg had a seizz or mozzarella on top.  We ordered the japanese garlic sauce, can't remember what the sauce was called but for the value everything tasted good.  The pasta was enjoyed by my girlfriend and her friend, i found that to be alright as it seemed a bit dry since it was baked but everyone else liked it a lot.  Overall youre prob looking at about $15 a person.  Its not fine dining but you get your moneys worth."}
