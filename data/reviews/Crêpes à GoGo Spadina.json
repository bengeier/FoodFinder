{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for ages having read so many favorable reviews so I had very high expectations. Thankfully my expectations were definitely met. The ladies who run the cafe are so friendly. I ordered the first crepe on the menu (forgot what it was called) and my brother ordered one with mozzarella, tomatoes, spinach and something else. Luckily we were able to grab a seat inside because it was too cold outside but the warmth of these crepes probably would've made the cold bearable. 

In short, the crepes were perfect. The ingredients were healthy and not overbearingly rich. They were of the right portion for a quick 'before-6-to-9' class meal and the fact that they were made fresh and literately placed into your hands was great. 

Prices range from $6-$15. The ones we were ordered were about $7 each. More expensive than street meat but that's the price you pay for quality food.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Unless you're starving. My brother was still pretty hungry after his eating his crepe."}
{"text":"I was in the Spadina area yesterday and decided to Crêpes à GoGo .  I'm very happy that I now know about this café! The ambiance makes you feel as if you are in Quebec or even France. All 3 staff were very friendly and made me feel comfortable enough to speak French. As for the crepes, they are authentic. A+ Tres bien!"}
{"text":"Crepes a gogo will always have a special place in my heart owing to constant patronage when i was in university.  While I would normally visit the location at yonge and bloor, I found myself at this location and fancied something light to pass the time.  The juliana seemed to fit that requirement today.  Raspberry jam and dark chocolate rolled together in a thin crepe certainly supported a welcome moment of nostalgia.   Paired with a warm bottle of limonana and cinnamon, I found myself watching out the window as pedestrians strolled by, contemplating the extent to which crepes a gogo manages to maintain such extreme consistency.  The staff were pleasant and the warm interior exhibited a coziness without feeling cramped."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 
The crepe wasn't very filling compared to other places. Loved the smoked salmon with the cream cheese though. Def not worth the 12$ but worth a try. 

If you tell them it is ur first time there they let you sample their homemade lemonade which was ok. The service was good. She
was very nice to explain us what some of the french named items were"}
{"text":"The yorkville location has been sold to someone else so this spading location is the only store that's still managed by the original owner.  I've been visiting this place since it was in yorkville and have now followed the owner to this new location.  It offers the best crepe in Toronto with just the perfect chewiness.  I usually share a savoury and a sweet one with my husband. You must try their lemonara drink as well."}
{"text":"Good crepes!  The lemon-mint drink they sell is good too, though a bit pricey imo.

This place also makes a solid espresso and cappuccino."}
{"text":"Probably repeating what others have said, sorry. 1. Best crepes in Toronto. 2. Super nice service. 3. Worst location in Toronto. This place is really more on Queen & not Spadina. It's in the Jewish Centre building on Spadina, but again on the Queen side. I went in with four others (only one couple sitting/eating) & we were bumping into each other while waiting. I like the lemon drink they push but Jeesh, their stockpiles take up way too much room right in the middle of the place. I think it's a pain to eat crepes on the go, especially nutella/choc, it invariably ends up on your face. If it's not too crowded or if the patio is open, definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Nice people who work there. Cute little place. Crepe was delicious and there was plenty of it. Would go back again and I definitely recommend it. It wasn't terribly expensive. Around $6 for a crepe."}
{"text":"Crepe itself was good. However, service and friendliness was not. My boyfriend and I came into Crepes a go go with iced coffee from second cup, we were handed a menu and told by the owner not to sip our drinks while looking at the menu. while we were waiting to order, an employee came in to work, and in front of all of the customers, the owner aggressively asks if he checked his email multiple times. He proceeded to say no and she went off on how he needs to check his emails and asked if he had a phone to use. 
He then left and she continued to make crepes while being terribly passive aggressive at another employee, this time in french, about how to use the credit card machine. 

When our crepes were done, she handed them to us and basically said you can't sit here, because we had a drink from another place. I understand this situation to a certain extent. Crepes a go go isn't primarily a sit down place. Hence \"go go\". We felt that were paying money to purchase their product and being disrespected and forced out the door makes me not want to return.  

If you don't care about customer service and passive aggressive owners, sure, great place to get a crepe!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for a quick - and surprisingly filling - bite to eat. I had the smoked salmon and tomato crepe and a cafe au lait, both were lovely. The coffee is served European style, on a tray with a glass of water. Also sampled the house lemonade with mint, which was nice, too. Great service. Very small space, though, with only a few tables."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience. Its quite small but the crepes are delicious and reasonably priced(compared to others) They don't use Nutella or any sugar(except for the organic kind). Moreover, the staff speak French and the music is French too. It really feels like you just stepped into a Parisian cafe. Love it, and I've tried many creperies."}
{"text":"Very cute store and the lady running it is cute too. And crepes are delicious and easy to hold in your hand. I especially loved her homemade lemonade!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and the owner was really sweet! I took out a dessert crepe to go, as well as her special limonada-it was light and  delicious! As a crêpe lover and someone who is shy, this place really makes me feel welcome! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have literally been walking by this place every day for the last two months, waiting for it to open. There was a bit of a false alarm about four weeks ago, when staff set up a Limonana stand outside and gave out free samples along with Limonana coupons for when the new location opened. I asked when they were opening and they said next week. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when this turned out not to be the case!

Walking by today, I noted that this place still wasn't open (at 8am and again at about 11am), however, later in the day, my boyfriend texted to let me know they had opened their doors. The trousers-purse-keys routine has never been executed so fast!

The staff here are lovely -- we were greeted with a friendly 'bonjour!' by the guy behind the cash and after a bit of Facebook stalkery, I have determined that Veronique, the general manager from the other Crepes a GoGo spot, was the one manning the stove. The guy handed us a menu right away and waited patiently while we mulled over the options. Having not been to their Yorkville location, I don't know if the menu is the same, but one assumes it is. I went for the Festival, which is cinnamon, sugar and strawberries, while my boyfriend got another option (the name of which escapes me!) that subbed in bananas in place of the strawberries.

I'm going to start by saying the fruit was fresh and the crepe itself was delicious. I've had a lot of crepes and these ones are the business. My boyfriend loved his combination because the crepes weren't in the least bit greasy or oily. I, on the other hand, would have liked a little more oil/grease/moisture. Not in the crepe, but something to help the whole dish down a little easier. The strawberries were very fresh and sliced very neatly, so they weren't providing a lot of moisture outside of their own function as tasty fresh fruit, and as someone who usually goes the butter/sugar/lemon juice route with crepes, there was a lot more chewing than I'm used to. However, I feel it's important to stress that it wasn't the crepes themselves that were dry, just my choice of filling didn't provide enough crepe lube. I definitely want to try another combination with a different filling.

While eating my crepe, I overheard another customer ask about opening hours. Verionique responded that she wasn't officially open until Monday. When the girl asked about opening hours for when they're officially open, she said \"Probably 8-10...\" It doesn't sound like it's set in stone yet, but I'm hoping it is. I'd love to hit this place up after dinner some night. Especially with the cold setting in. They had a pretty fancy looking coffee machine behind the counter that I'm dying to take for a test drive, too.

Four stars because I'm reserving the fifth for my next visit. I'm going to order something that's a little bit ... goopier and see if it matches up. It was the only fault that I could find today, so let's hope a change in order eliminates it."}
{"text":"Small place. Nice deco. A little escape to France.
The staff were sweet and inviting.
I ordered the Big Ben. That's the flavor I like. Never go wrong and they did it well.
I was soooooooooo fulllllll. I eat a lot of stuff today:("}
{"text":"Tellement bon!!


It's such a relief to finally find a good creperie in Toronto.

I've tried plenty of bad crepes here, I'm looking at you Cafe Crepe & Crepe It Up!!!

However, this place makes crepe the proper way, thin and slightly crisp.

I had breakfast here and ordered the parisien crepe which had scrambled eggs mushroom shallots and some Swiss cheese. 

Also worth mentioning, the service was excellent and very welcoming.

Highly recommended.

My only gripe about this place is the lack of ventilation above the cooking stations, so be prepared to smell like a fryer."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend before going to Friday Night Live @ the ROM.  Walking in, the place is very small.  There are 3 tables (2 person tables) in total and a bar area near the window that had no more than 4 seats.  I asked first to use their washroom which I then promptly found out that they didn't have one.  In order to use the washroom, you have to go into the Jewish Centre around the corner to use the public washroom.  

We both had the Parisienne which had scrambled eggs, cheese, dill, mushrooms and red onions.  The crepe came out quickly, was nice and warm and wasn't as buttery as the ones I've had in the past or in Paris.  The mushrooms were largely uncooked which wasn't bad because I don't mind uncooked mushrooms.  I didn't care too much for the dill taste.  Overall though, the crepe was light and pretty good.  

I also ordered a chocolate milk but interestingly, what I received was a hot chocolate.  I didn't question it since it was kind of cold anyway so just had it.  The hot chocolate wasn't particularly creamy...pretty standard.  

Overall, I liked the crepe at Crepes a GoGo but the lack of washroom and getting my order wrong would probably prevent me from coming back to this location.  I'd probably go to the one at Bloor and Yonge instead next time."}
{"text":"I believe this is my first review ever so let me preface with this: I've never felt so compelled to write a review before I had visited this quaint little crepe shop on the corner of Bloor and Spadina.  Dining here made me forget that I was in Toronto.

My girlfriend and I first enter the shop looking for a quick little dessert before we get on our way.  We plan on eating in the restaurant, so the owner hastily makes space for us by rushing to clean the table from a previous customer (this place has very limited seating, so I wouldn't plan going with a large group).  We then make the mistake of waiting in line to order our crepes, as the owner insists that she serve us at our table.  From there on, the owner herself makes us feel welcome and comfortable in this restaurant that she clearly cares for dearly.

We end up ordering the Tartinade and the Sugar crepes (both $6 each) along with her signature Limonana drink (3$).  I'm not exactly a crepe connoisseur but my impressions are as follows.  The Tartinade was filled with hazelnut syrup, with the perfect type of softness that compounded to a very delicious crepe.  If you're looking for a nice little dessert then I would highly recommend the Tartinade.  

Now, her Limonana drink.  You initially get samples from her, where she will explain to you (and essentially every other customer that sits down) the details of her drink.  It is a minty-tea type concoction that just screamed one word: refreshing.  You know that one Nestea commercial where the guy drinks it and then he falls into a little pool of Nestea behind him?  Yeah, that pool should actually be filled with Limonana because that stuff is nutty.  Highly recommend.

I'm not exactly sure if I'm painting the correct picture here, but one thing that I absolutely need to get across here is that this is a real change in environment from its immediate surroundings.  I really loved the sense French in the decor here.  Mostly everything is in French, the owner speaks constant French to her employees, plenty of French along the wall and admittedly this French really gets to you.  At one point, while the owner asked if the crepes were good, she patted my girlfriend on her shoulder and my girlfriend replied with \"Oui.\"  She was literally engulfed by all the French around us.  

So, in between the homeyness, delicious Limonana and crepes, the quirky and exuberant owner, and the tiny seating area, I would definitely recommend anyone to try to this place. They do not just have sweet crepes, a large portion of their menu are savoury crepes, which I will definitely be back to try.  I truly hope you come here not just to have a cheap and delicious crepe, but to enjoy the surroundings created by an owner passionate for culture and making others happy."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, and as a student on the go it is a fantastic option! 

Good Stuff: The options for fillings between the sweet and savoury selection are many, the service is great, the location is accessible by the subway, the crepes are delicious and portable! The Limonana drink is also a must try, cold or hot!

Caution: Limited seating, the location is cozy yet small so if you are coming with a group take your crepes à GoGo!

Overall Impression: ..I want a crepe now, this place is great."}
{"text":"I am a stickler for customer service and Crepes a GoGo was one of the BEST experiences in service I have had in a long time. The owner greeted me warmly as I entered, took a minute to show me the menu and explain why her crepes different...the perfect amount of information. I then asked for a cafe au lait and true to her claim, it was the best I had ever had and didn't need an ounce of sugar. 

I can't speak highly enough about this place. A+ for service, quality of food, speed of service and overall experience. Other restaurant owners could learn a thing or two from her!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and homey! Breakfast crepes here r satisfying, light, but filling! Easy to take away and offers very original mixes."}
{"text":"Nice little crepes bistro on Bloor at Spadina.  Lady inside was very polite and very nice, she actually took time to speak some French with my son and talk about Paris.
Crepes were good, not fantastic, but tasty enough.  The crepse are $8 or $10 Canadian"}
{"text":"Great service and food is fresh and high quality . Tried the classic cheese and egg crepe. I ordered the limo nana drink which was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch and had the big Ben brie with jam and brie cheese. I'm usually not a fan of savoury crepes but this one was delicious. Just the right balance between the different flavours to create a really pleasant crepe. The owner made our crepe and was just such a pleasant person and very French. She was warm and very friendly and you could tell that she takes a lot of pride in her work.

Pro tip: speak whatever French you know because it's such fun time!"}
{"text":"crepes are great, i tried the brie with the raspberry or strawberry jam. superb!

But the owner i believe was the worse person in treating her nervous staff who clearly either came from quebec or france recently, because he struggled in english. She has customer favourites and super annoying. god help whoever works under her authority"}
{"text":"We entered the restaurant, asked for outdoor seating. I was with four other people, the woman who worked there sat us and left. The table was shaking. 

I had the chocolate milk - personally it was the best chocolate milk I've ever had in my life!!

But when I tried to order...

I asked if I could have the crepe with goat cheese, oil, and spinach (I don't remember the crepes name) and smoked salmon. 

(I enjoy eating certain combination of food that others don't enjoy)

The owner refused to make me the crepe! Saying that it would taste bad. Even after I told her I liked goat cheese and salmon together she still refused.

 I got the crepe without salmon, and it wasn't very good. 

My recommendation? The owner should be focusing on what the costumer wants, not what she wants. 

Would I recommend this place: No
To chocolate milk lovers? Yes"}
{"text":"Ambience: 3/5 (Functional & clean)  
Food: 4/5 
Service: 4/5 (Friendly)
Value: 4/5 
Repeat: I have many times."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  Big Ben Brie is a must. Wonderful service. Excellent authentic French crepes and the owner gave me a free French lesson.  Tres Bon!"}
{"text":"Good, authentic French crepes, a bit pricey for me though. The cafe is small and has few tables, yet the service is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. I tried one of the sweet crepes, which was delicious."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful and thanks to the lovely proprietress who lavished kind,genteel and welcoming hospitality on us. Crepes were DeLish (of course), the LemoNana inviting and fresh but her hospitality truly superb. Merci! Gracias! Abrigada! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered one brie cheese crepe with strawberry jam that was so delicious, fluffy and warm - it was a rainy day and the meal was perfect to lighten the mood a little bit! Service greeted me in French and was super friendly and attentive all the time.

The place is super nice, elegant and cozy, the only thing I can say is that the seats are a little bit uncomfortable for me - my back was destroyed after eating my crepe and drinking my tea but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tasting crepes and really good service. The owner and staff are courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"An adorable little place! (\"little\" to be interpreted literally as the place only has a few tables) The service was super friendly and welcoming, the crepes were delicious, and prices were about average ($9.50 or so for a crepe). They certainly give off an authentically French vibe, and I am guessing this is why they don't offer any meat crepes (only vegetarian, egg, tuna, and salmon options). I thoroughly enjoyed my scrambled egg-filled crepe, but the foodie in me would have really liked to have thrown a strip or two of bacon in there...."}
{"text":"Very petit and cosy space, came at off time on way to metro. Cappuccino was very milky, more of a cafe au lait. Very tasty, served to eat wrapped to go. Quick and easy. Recommend the Parisienne & Veronique, first savory the second sweet. Given sample of lemon/mint drink, not sure for me."}
{"text":"Wonderful crêpe (had a TomTom) - the crepe was warm and soft and the smoked salmon nicely moist. Delicate balance of flavours and very friendly service. Would love to come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for how french they made this place=)

the staff were both french (from france), the menu is in french, they were showing a Louis De Funes movie and there was an old map of Paris on one of the walls=) CUTE!

ah and did I say the crepes are YUMMY! prices range from $6 to $15 or so and will satisfy all your taste buds with the variety of flavors they have. 

great spot and cozy cafe! almost no seating inside but a tiny patio up front"}
{"text":"The most delicious crepes, a wonderfully polite, passionate, and entertaining owner, and their drinks ( ive had the gogo creme and am addicted to limonana) are incredible."}
{"text":"This is the only and real crêpe à go go location! Everything is of high quality. The crêpe itself is truly the best I've had even compared to ones in France. It is perfectly done, not soggy like most other places. The ingredients are also top quality and the combinations are creative. We went to the old Yonge location and could tell right away that it's no longer run by Veronique because it is simply not as good. The new mgmt there even pretend nothing changed and just that she's not around. How evil! Now we know where to go to have our favorite cried crêpe in the world!"}
{"text":"No doubt that crepes here are the best you'll ever have, in Toronto anyway. 

An having a second location didn't seem to take a toll on quality at all. 

The menu is the same and I have the same dilemma trying to choose one. 

My favourites include Veronique and the Big Ben with Extra (scrambled egg). I havent had this in a while and not sure of they still do it. 

I prefer the regular crepe to the rolled up one. Not sure why. 

The staff is friendly and it's a requirement they speak French. It's interesting that almost everyone thy comes in also speaks perfect French. Makes me feel like I had to bring out the Francais as well.  I mean what other restaurant an make you feel like that !! 
I love that French is Canada's 2nd language and so many people speak it. 

Off topic any how. If you're in the area, there's no where else to go. 

Their price point is a bit high though. On average $9 for a good crepe. I'd pay it, but not every day. It totally worth it."}
{"text":"I dropped by here and ordered just a cafe at the time. Even though, they are soooo friendly and show warm welcome. A week later, I came back with my friend and had a savory. It was very tasty. It looked like thin and we talked about going to a pizza place afterwards because we thought that our stomachs are not gonna to be full. However, we were so satisfied and forgot the idea. The friend even ordered a sweet one, too.

I surely come back with my friends and family in the future!"}
{"text":"This is a little restaurant that has the feeling as if you were actually in a little town in France. Crepes are just plain delicious! All ingredients are top notch and they just melt in your palate. This is the traditional way to serve crepes, right in your hand (instead of in a plate with knife and fork). We had dessert crepes, and the personal attention of the owner. 
She does her own lemonade, which can also been served warm for those winter days. A must try. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because their crepes are amazing! I've tried two, both of which I loved enough to come back for. Along with the crepes, the atmosphere is also very important to me. This is a little French cafe where you can sit down and just relax while conversing with friends. You can practice speaking French with the owner, which is a change from all the other cafes that I have visited in Toronto. I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is a little expensive to me.

I tried:
1. Champagnarde: 9/10. 
2. Côte d'Azur: 9/10."}
{"text":"Discovered this place with a bunch of friends during break. The food was delicious, the service was awesome, the people were super nice. They also gave us little tea cups of warm lemon-y honey drink which were delicious and so nice after we walked in from the freezing weather.  I wish we'd discovered this place on the first day instead of the last day so we could've eaten here EVERY DAY. We all had savory crepes (for lunch) but I really wish I could go back and try some sweet ones, as well as the rest of the savory ones. 10/10 would eat again :)"}
{"text":"The food was good, but what killed this visit was the atmosphere. The chef could not stop berating the poor waitress over the tiniest slip up of protocol, etiquette, or even grammar. As someone who worked in the restaurant industry, extremely upsetting to watch for an entire meal. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"When the owner is around, she keeps standards.  
From her staff - which she scoulds for not making the crepes as she taught them to; to her customers.  Don't like it?  Tough :)  Apparently you may be breaking 101 rules of proper manners in public... wish some owners would hold those standards too.

Anyways the Crepes, they're well done when executed, and their flavor combos different from other crepe places (very European.)  She sells a nice lemonade/mint drink that is low in sugar... it is really light.

The place is small, clean and functional.

Recommend this place if you want a nice crepe to eat on the go."}
{"text":"Anything that I say about this place is less! It's the best crepes that I have ever had in my life. Period. And I have had many even in France. The crepes here come as close to being authentic to the true Parisian ones! A must try !!"}
{"text":"Love coming here when im downtown for work. They have less chairs than last year but the French owner is still as kind and vibrant as always. Love their spinach and brie crepe. My coworker insisted on not eating but after i began chomping on mine she jumped in this band wagon and ordered the same ;)

They cut the crepe in 2 and place it in a cute holder for you. Good portion sizes for lunch and always fresh never frozen ingredients. 

If its your first time youll most likely be offered a behind the kitchen peak into their techniques!

Lots of dessert crepe options as well!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  

As soon as the girl taking my order realized i could speak french, our conversation was toute en francais.  she even helped me with my grammar.  it was really cute.

i got simple: une crepe avec du beurre et canelle (butter and cinnammon).  

my first crepe a go go experience was in yorkville.  

such an amazing idea, and the owner is from France.  

I'll be back.  

merci!!"}
{"text":"The best crêperie in town, period. From the moment we walked in and Chéf Véronique came to take our coats, to the \"à bientôt\" as we left, everything was an 100% French experience. I was going to say the small space is a minus but in fact it wasn't: it's good to have tiny places where you can have a cup of coffee and some crêpes without being annoyed by 30 other people around you. The service is quick, the café au lait is to die for and the crêpes, well, if you don't devour them for the taste, you'll for sure adore the diversity of taste: salmon, sweet, vegetarian...It's also refreshing to be able to walk in a store in Toronto and communicate just as easily in both English and French. Amazing place overall. Will be taking many more breakfasts here from now on!"}
{"text":"Food is on point, older lady who runs the business is not. My first time here, and I came in to her yelling at one of her staff members about how it's hard for them to speak English. When I was ordering food there was a friendly younger lady serving me, and the older lady said some snark remark to her and kicked her off the register. Employees seem very under appreciated and it makes for a terrible environment because of how uncomfortable you feel sitting in the business as the lady running it is talking down to her employees."}
{"text":"Such a lovely little place, the food was delicious and their speciality drink is definitely worth a try. Perfect for francophones also!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this cute place for an early dinner. A small, pretty cafe that is very French and has a lot of vegetarian options! 

I had the Parisienne - a pretty standard savory crepe with mushrooms and mozzarella. Just the light but tasty dinner I wanted!

Special mention to the very French old lady at the counter was probably the friendliest person I've seen at a restaurant :) full marks for service!"}
{"text":"So, apparently CaG makes the best crepes in Toronto. Their savory crepes are perfect to eat while you stroll down the annex. They make all of their crepes to order as it should be, -none of that unacceptable ready-made stack o' crepes waiting to be topped. As with their Yorkville location, this one also has A+ service. 

For tourists (especially Americans), Crepes a GoGo is a must-try.
I recommend their lemonade, I finally got to try it at this location."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and never thought to go in. But since I had some time to kill before class this morning, I thought I'd grab breakfast.

The first surprise was that this is a pretty authentic crêpe café! I was expecting something like Cafe Crepe on Queen St., but both the vibe and food here are hugely reminiscent of the crêperies in France - the owner spoke all in French, which I thought was really cool. 

Second surprise was that the crêpes are actually super yummy. There were so many delicious-sounding options that I couldn't decide what to get, but I ended up settling on the Dina-mique (filled with brie, tomato, red onion, basil, and olive oil). The crêpe was light and slightly chewy and the flavour combination of brie, tomato, & basil was perfect - would highly recommend.

This place is also very vegetarian/pescatarian friendly (huge plus). My only complaint is that the space isn't very large/a bit cramped so it's not really ideal for a sit-down meal."}
{"text":"Terribly slow, angry staff, who couldn't keep up with three orders in front of us. The crepes were good. But there was nowhere to sit (it really is \" to go \") and it was WAY too hot in the restaurant. I won't be returning. They also only gave me napkins after I asked several times."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and looked in, just to have the owner wave at me. She is super chatty and knows practically everyone that walks by. 

Everyone in this cute cafe speaks French & they have French-only days once a week! 

As for food, I got the Quebecoise - mozzarella, scrambled egg & maple syrup. It was delicious - although the syrup sank to the bottom and the egg just sort of morphed into the cheese. 

One of the best crepes I've ever had and very easy to eat to go. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Tom Tom with Brie and.. Something with Tuna.  I visited this place 5 years ago and today. Nothing changed!! So good  and she is a very kind person!"}
{"text":"Cozy place with great crêpes. The mozzarella + raspberry jam crêpe was surprisingly good. This place does not skimp on filling! 

There aren't too many sweet crêpes on the menu, mainly savoury, making this a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place! It is very unique and has a lot of charm. The owner is very interesting, with a smile the whole time. She even invented her own low-sugar, mint, lemon beverage; she is not shy about her pride in that!

I reluctantly went inside and she quickly put me at ease and had me try a breakfast crepe. I really liked how she made the crepe right in front of me and was very conversational with the occasional \"merci\". There was a soft french music playing in the background to tie the atmosphere together.

Overall, the crepe was a bit out of my comfort zone, but much better than I thought. I would definitely go back and try out the other crepes if I ever go back to Toronto."}
{"text":"The owner's attitude and treatment of her employees is absolutely disgusting. I was really looking forward to coming here and when I arrived, the owner Veronique was stressing out her employees and yelling at them so much it became almost unbearable to wait inside for my food. I felt SO UNCOMFORTABLE just being there. I understand she wants to run a tight ship but there are other ways of doing that than being a HORRIBLE BOSS. Lift your employees up, inspire them, make them feel appreciated, don't publicly humiliate them. I definitely won't be coming back to support an owner who cannot support her workers."}
{"text":"Bon appetit! This is an adorably decorated French cafe with services as friendly as your average Canadian and food as amazing as Paris.

Upon entering, you're greeted in French by waitresses with a friendly smile on their faces. The chairs are a little small and probably won't fit an average Kardashian bum and the tables are quite small as well. The restaurant is tight, but cozy and there is a constant stream of people popping in and out.

Since it was our first time, we were served a sample of minty lemonade which was very refreshing on a hot summer day. This complements the savory salmon and cream cheese crêpes I ordered perfectly.

The crêpes are freshly made, piping hot, and boast of ingredients filled to the brim with creamy cheese and salmon. The food was so well made that I wasn't even angry about not being full afterwards. 

I ordered the Nutella and banana crêpes as a dessert and again, it was out of this world. The warm Nutella and the ripe banana complements the hot and fluffy crêpe perfectly.

I am so happy with this place and very satisfy with everything from the quaint decor to the meal and the service."}
{"text":"Totally delicious crepes. The popeye is my favorite, very delicate flavors. The limonana (house-made lemonade with mint) is also a real treat, but I wish they stored it off site so there was more room for seating!! The dyna-mique is also delightful - very tasty!"}
{"text":"Crepes a go-go....how about crepes a no-no.

It's quite possible I have the biggest sweet tooth in the history of sweet tooth's....and if there's one thing someone with a sweet tooth doesn't like in their food (or anyone for that matter) it's plastic....not only does it probably cancer causing when ingested.....it tastes horrid and is often a choking hazard to the unsuspecting.

I love breakfast so naturally I love crepes. Last week I decided to treat myself and try out the famous \"crepes a go-go\". After what seeming like an hour of much debate I settled on the \"King Sam\".(a delectable mix of Nutella, Bananas, almonds and coconut). Service was quick but the staff were not the friendliest of sorts. I understand not being a morning person all too well...but the least they could have done was try to fake a smile.

Once receiving my masterpiece I was all ready to enjoy my sugar rush. After much anticipation I cut into my crepe. As I stabbed it with my fork I was met with something hard. Upon further inspection it revealed what appeared to be a large hard piece of plastic. Thoroughly not impressed I brought it over to the counter to show the staff. After having to wait about 10 minutes for them to finish helping everyone around me I was finally able to show them what I had found. 

.....after expressing mine and my sweet tooth's disappointment in only the kindest of ways....the reaction of the sales person was \"oh that sucks\" ...then she continued to reach over bare handed, pull out the plastic and say \"there you go\". I don't think I've ever been so shocked. Needless to say I left everything behind walked out of the store with a permanent look of horror on my face with no plans to ever come back, nor recommend this place to anyone. 

Truly disappointing experience, truly disappointing breakfast. Unless you are a human garbage disposable (not in a good way) I do not suggest visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"Having been to the Yorkville location, I was pleasantly surprised to find another Go Go in the city! 

Same concept and menu as their original store - crepes (savory and sweet), omelettes and salads. All the people who work there are from France so you feel the vibe of being in France. Their crepes are made to order so you're getting a fresh one. I had the chocolate crepe with bananas ($6) today, but picked up a bottle of Limonana to go. There are a couple of tables so eating-in is an option.

Looking forward to see more Go Go's in the city !"}
{"text":"Yes, I come here almost weekly for their delicious crepes. Big Ben and Popeye are amazing, and try the limonana drink warmed with cinnamon. You can't go wrong. The owner likes to yell at lot at her staff (I know because I speak French), but I guess it adds to the French charm of this place."}
{"text":"Love this place - super fun for a quick crepe on the go. Sorry, a krepppezz on the go. A lot of the staff seem to speak French better than English, and it's always really fun to walk in and chat with them. They have a small patio area, but I prefer my kreeppez a gogo.

Service is nice and friendly but slow. I love their basics - nutella for the sweet, and ham and cheese for the savory."}
{"text":"Just like the first location, I really can't write anything more positive about this place without sounding like a crazy person.  The ownership is the same, the food is the same, even the decore is the same.

The restaurant is smaller and they do not offer table service at this location.  That's not missed considering the vastly different demographic of this area.  At the motherhship in yorkville, you want to go hang out to be seen where as here you're just grabbing a bite and dashing off to class, or to work, or to whatever.

They do have a bit of patio space corralled in by the lovely square steel bolted-to-the-concrete railings, so this would be a great place to people-watch when spring has sprung."}
{"text":"My crepe is burnt. Which doesn't make it awful perse, but really, a burnt crepe is a bad start...Parts of it are basically a cracker and other parts are hard and chewy :(

So Super french lady had a noob on cash. It was clearly his first day, he was out of his element and forgot to charge me for a drink. It got to a point where the crepe-grill lady had to take over and process the transaction again because the cashier was just so lost. She was bossing him around in angry french and it was weird. I kept smiling at cashier guy cause I felt so bad. The French are clearly amazing at verbal abuse.

I'm willing to give cash guy a break, because we've all been noobs at one point or another and had our fuck ups. 

But the shitty crepe is another thing. The only redeeming part about my crepe was that the ingredients were clearly fresh which made the crepe flavorful. However, parts of my Parisienne crepe were not cooked (I had raw mushroom in portions) the egg portion was all of a tiny sliver, and once again BURNT CREPE. There was a family of 3 who had ordered before me and it seemed like my crepe was an afterthought or perhaps a failed burnt attempt, so I got stuck with a garbage crepe while the cute family of 3 got the proper tasty crepes. And I paid a total of nearly 14 bucks for my dumpster crepe and drink. GOT DAM.

Childless people want tasty things too :("}
{"text":"This charming restaurant makes you feel like you are in France! The owner is a friendly, confident middle aged French lady who only converses in French with her employees. The menu is one that she created herself and she loves each and every dish (if you ask her for recommendations, she will tell you that!).

D got the Nicoise which had zatar, black olives, basil, tuna, and mozzarella. I got the Dominique which was a bit lighter and had brie, red onion, basil, and tomato. DIVINE. Both of our crepes were savory and we enjoyed each and every bite. For dessert, we got the chocolate hazelnut crepe which the owner graciously split into two for us. This crepe was HEAVEN. She makes the chocolate hazelnut spread herself. Words cannot describe how good this crepe was. My mouth is watering thinking about it right now. 

For drinks we got the cafe au lait and the chocolate espresso. Both exceeded our expectations. We thought it was funny (but very French!) that the owner told us we were not allowed to add sugar to her coffees and that they are already served perfectly. She also does not serve any ice in her restaurant lolz. 

I wish I lived in Toronto because I would definitely eat here multiple times a week. These crepes are better than the ones I've had in Paris and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Went in for a savoury crepe, did not really enjoy it. However,  the atmosphere was really comfortable and the service was great."}
{"text":"You can't beat the friendly staff here as well as the freshly prepared french crepe. Don't think you can go wrong with any crepe that you choose.
A must try: there Limonana drink. It's made with lemon and mint. Not to set, not to sour. Perfect for the summer stunning it chilled or with ice."}
{"text":"Great little escape to France. These are not IHOP crepes, these are the real deal. Great selection of toppings. Coffee choices are espresso only, no drip coffee.

I had a 'Big Ben' and a cappuccino for b'fast while in Toronto. Tasty."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying i am one of the pickiest foodies out there..very judgmental when it comes to food. Me and my sister were looking for a spot that won't make me complain after and boy did we fall in love not just with the food and the reasonable pricing but the place has a very authentic and personal feel to it. I felt like i was in a small town in france..the chef was so sweet and welcoming makes you feel like you're at your favorite aunts house and her food has an authentic and personal touch to it. We had omelet crepes i don't remember the names but it was the chef's recommendation. it was healthy and flavorful yet light enough you don't feel like taking a nap after, instead you feel energetic and satisfied (what food is supposed to do) and we had this amazing organic lemon drink thing i don't remember the name but it was soooo good and perfect on a hot summer day. i highly recommend you try it. we need more of that in toronto..NO more chain restaurants please!"}
{"text":"This is mostly a grab and go crêpe place but they also have a few small tables if you want to eat inside. I had the Veronique crepe and Limonana and both were delicious.  I think the Veronique had some cheese, spinach (?) and maple syrup in it, which was an unexpected combination but it worked. Although this was a small place,  I received such incredibly warm and attentive service. Can't believe I pass by this place all the time and never thought to check it out before now. I'll definitely be back to try their other crêpes."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed, this little gem. On a quick trip to Toronto, I stumbled off the train in need of coffee. I was quick to pick a new place. Well the place my weary mind picked was a delight. The proprietor was a sweet lady who spoke a mixture of English and French. 
She answered my questions. Made a an amazing crap. Warm and just the perfect chew. The coffee ( or café) was great. There was also a lemon and mint drink the was delicious.  

Later that same day I came back to ask for directions and some more of the Lemonana. I was meet with a very warm welcome, recognition of myself, direction and recommendations to a great store."}
{"text":"Amazing, bilingual staff, the most wonderful owner, delicious authentic French crepes."}
{"text":"Brand new Crepes a GoGo opened up right at the corner of Bloor and Spadina. I am excited! 

Limited seating inside... with only 3 tables for 2, maybe some patio seating, but it wouldn't be available till spring! With no table services, this location is more like a takeout place.

2 staffs working this evening: one cooking and one taking my order.  My
Tartinade ($6.00) was ready to eat in merely a few minutes since I were the only one there....

Fresh, piping hot, soft, chewy, tasty and smell so good...........

Oh! Can I have another one?!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing breakfast experience I have ever had...the place is a really cozy to go crepe place, the crepes were filling and awesome and the owner was the most amazing person I have ever met...."}
{"text":"I loved my experience Crêpes à Gogo in Yorkville, and the new Spadina location is equally charming. The place is tiny with limited seating, so it's best for take-out. Seriously, this place makes me want to move downtown just so I could here on a weekly basis! 

Even though I'm always up for trying something new, I couldn't resist ordering the Parisienne ($9) again because it was just so good! I love, love, love the combination of scrambled eggs, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, red onion and dill! 

The crêpe came piping hot and I had to consciously remind myself to eat slowly to savour every bite! There's just something about these crêpes that's so inexplicably addictive. My first instinct was to just inhale the whole thing! 

At my insistence, my bf ordered a sweet and savoury crêpe- the Québécoise ($8), with scrambled egg, mozzarella, and maple syrup. A slight problem with the Québécoise was that all the maple syrup sank to the bottom, so you couldn't really get much of the sweetness for the first few bites. And when you get to the bottom, the maple syrup literally drips out (grab some napkins!) Nevertheless, I loved the sweet, savoury and cheesy combination, and I am seriously considering ordering this crêpe for myself next time.

This was a great option to satisfy the sweet tooth without having dessert. But if you're looking for an actual dessert crêpe, I'd recommend the tartinade ($6), made with their version of Nutella. We had it last time and it was absolutely fabulous!

We washed down the crêpes with a glass of their signature Limonana served cold.  In summary, Crêpes à Gogo is the perfect place to grab a quick bite- the crêpes are fresh and delicious! It's no wonder that they were voted the best crêpes in Toronto on BlogTO. Make no mistake, I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"LOVED the ambiance in this cute little crepe shop. Feels as if you stepped into a little restaurant in Paris. The owner is so lovely!

Ordered a simple Nuttella crepe and a hot Limonana...delicious!"}
