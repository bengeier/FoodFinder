{"text":"We were staying at the Holiday inn and attending an event at the Holiday inn. Due to time constraints we had to eat at Michael's grill for breakfast. We are at the buffet. The food was terrible. The eggs were cold and hard, the only banana was so soft i asked for a replacement and never got one. The plates were wet and had to ask for it to be dried prior to using it. To give credit where it is due, the staff were always nice and the English muffin that I toasted was hot and crispy. Otherwise I will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Staying here at the Holiday Inn, and couldn't help but smell the goodness coming out of this place as I went to my room.   The boys and I decided to eat in tonight and gave Michaels a try .   Tonight's feature was a pasta bar /buffet, with salads and and a few other entrees like beef tips, Trout Almondine and also a selection of desserts.  We all opted for the buffet.  The sous chef making the pastas was fast, personable,  and helped each of us create a delicious mix of YUM.  We enjoyed it very much, the price was ok, and the service was good.  We will definitely be considering Michaels tomorrow!"}
{"text":"A gang of us ordered appetizers-for-dinner, and they were uniformly bleah. The \"bruschetta\" consisted of cold hothouse tomatoes that clearly had been in the fridge for a long time, and the crab cakes were cold in the middle, also indicating a casual attitude towards preparation. For the price, which was in the haute regions, I would have expected more attention to detail. I thought long and hard about giving them a single star, but it doesn't quite reach my threshold of \"I'd rather starve to death than eat here again\" for one star reviews. But close."}
