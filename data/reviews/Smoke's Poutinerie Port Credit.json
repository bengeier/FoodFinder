{"text":"Taking poutine to a whole new level. So glad I don't have to travel to the Toronto location anymore to enjoy high quality poutine."}
{"text":"Nice place, really like that they are open late. Got the Rainbow poutine with veggie gravy. Made the mistake of a WOW size..... only get this size if you are sharing with 1-2 other people or got serious munchies. It was good quality, however I will echo what others have said here on the amount of cheese curds. Especially for the WOW size, the curds were almost non existent. I will come back though it was a good experience. Server was really nice and store was clean.Loved that they have all the condiments available for you to get yourself."}
{"text":"It was okay, not the best poutine but they do have an amazing set of options for you to pick from.  It's open late, a good place for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Smokes is always the best poutine in the GTA! So happy they are here in the Mississauga area. This gives me excuses to visit Port Credit more often. If you haven't had Smokes, you're missing out! The classic poutine with bacon is my fave."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely amazing. Sean and Candice are phenomenal.. My boyfriend and I checked out the square one location and hated it. This place is the bomb. Best poutine in Mississauga. 5 stars way wayyy UP! Definitely will be coming back!!!!!"}
{"text":"So many pouting options it took me forever to choose! It was my first time in Canada and wanted to try something \"local\" I got poutine with cheese curds and baconI believe and it was so delicious! I couldn't even eat it all, the portions are generous. I definitely recommend, especially if you're a first time poutiner!"}
{"text":"I already love poutines and coming here I love them even more.  they have a great variety of toppings and great combinations for meat eater and vegetarians.  the prices are great for the huge portions you get. the gravy is the right amount of beefy/salty and the spiced fries are a great complement. Some of the combinations a really interesting and wouldn't think of it, but they do go great together. I love the country style with chicken poutine. Sometimes I get it without the chicken just because I'm not in the mood, but the gravy with the peas, mushrooms and cheese curds are awesome.   I ordered a \"WOW\" Size and my 3 friends and I were full. It doesn't get any better than that. The meal size is good enough for 1-2 people depending on if your eating anything else (grabbing a burger or something) and the small good for just yourself, not sharing needed.  The only CON I have for this place is the location. Anyone who knows Port Credit know parking is annoying, there is a parking lot near the community center but it's usually full and street parking is hard to find. So thinking about the winter, coming here is going to be a hat trick.  I do recommend everyone try this place at least once to try it first hand. Even the little walk form the parking is worth it.   COME ON! ITS A POUTINE!!! YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT!!!!"}
{"text":"A classic smokes! Now located in the popular lakeshore strip of Mississauga. Finally!    Came here on a Saturday nights grab some dinner and the group I was with was pleasantly greeted and helped. The service was great and interactive. We had three poutines all of which were made up to the standards of the smokes located downtown.   The place itself has limited seating, so grab a seat and have your friend order.   The delivery time of the food was good, we waited maybe 2-5 minutes but our food was hot and good!  Another franchise to add to port credits growing community! Will go again!"}
{"text":"This totally satisfied my craving for French fries and Poutine!!!   A group of us came here after a night out at El Jefe (a bar/resto just down the street, go check it out!). We arrived around 2-2:30am, they close at 4am (damn!) and it was during daylight savings so we got an extra hour of partying and eating!!   It was surprisingly pretty dead so we were able to make an order right away and waited about 10 minutes for our food to be ready.   My fianc√© and I shared...of course we were hungry so we decided to get the \"wow\" size....at the time we thought it was a good idea but didn't realize how big it really was!! It was HUGE, probably could've fed at least one other person. We paid about $14. Others got the \"meal\" size and even that was a lot!  The place was kind of a mess...chairs scattered, food on the floor, food on the counters, the napkins and condiments area was dirty....but hey, with a bunch of drunk people coming in and out it's understandable!"}
{"text":"Delicious topping combos for poutine... Beef, pork, chicken, vegetarian and they have a vegetarian gravy as well.  My complaint is that there is never enough cheese curds or gravy."}
{"text":"Stay far far away from here the fries are cold with ice cold cheese and boiling hot gravy and the toppings taste microwaved"}
{"text":"The chicken inferno came in 3 different sizes: snack, meal & wow! I noticed that their sodium levels are lower than most poutineries because most of the other places I've been rely on drowning the potatoes in salt and then adding more salt to the gravy.... the spice level was medium, not too spicy but enough to make the chicken flavourful. Paid $10 for a meal size poutine."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and poutine. Even the vegetation gravy is delicious, excellent location as well."}
{"text":"Ordered from here through skip the dishes...found a hair in my poutine. First and last time ordering from them"}
{"text":"Great snack spot.  Staff are efficient and food is reasonably priced and filling.  Been to this location a few times and never been disappointed.  Peppercorn chicken is excellent the gravy is nicely spiced with whole peppercorn.  A healthy amount of meat is given.  The steak peppercorn is equally as good but with the curds too salty for my taste.  Surprisingly leftovers keep well when re heated the next day the fries were still soft and fresh.  Ask for curds on the side if your taking out and plan to reheat later. I have no idea if this is authentic poutine.....if that matters to you."}
{"text":"I've been going to smokes religiously ever since it first opened. So glad it's finally in mississauga now too. They had their grand opening today. Staff seems friendly. A bit pricey but worth it. I always get the pulled pork poutine. Good portion size at this location or so it seems at first. But my poutine had a very high ratio of fries to cheese, gravy and toppings. Usually when I mix it in there always enough to coat all or most the fries. About half my box of fries were naked even after mixing everything in so the bottom was just dry and bland fries. Still will be back but hopefully they've adjusted the portion ratios a bit by then!"}
{"text":"I've been going to smokes for a few years.  I used to drive down to Adelaide from Mississauga just to satisfy my poutine craving. I am so glad they have opened 2 locations in Mississauga. Went last New years day to satisfy my poutine craving before I started my \"healthier eating\" on the 2nd and it was awesome like always!"}
{"text":"Great place for a midnight meal after the club. This particular smokes was very clean. I was surprised and it actually made me smile.  Great job on the food as usual."}
{"text":"Got the Pulled Pork poutine and it was nice and hot.. pretty tasty. Worth the wait in the line up"}
{"text":"This review is going to be pretty short and if you want a little more in terms of detail, take a gander at my review for The Burger's Priest which, coincidentally, happens to be right across the street. The excitement that I had for Smoke's opening up in Port Credit was similar to the time I found out that we would have a Burger's Priest location.   And both times? Sheer and utter disappointment.    I won't regurgitate the same stuff (again, see other review) but it comes down to one thing: mushrooms. I freaking HATE mushrooms. I am also a vegetarian. What did I discover the veggie gravy was made out of at Smoke's? Take a wild guess.   So it's a fail. Yeah, the fries are pretty good (hence two stars) and I'm sure I'll pop in for them once in a while. But not the poutine. Poutini's doesn't use mushrooms, neither does Harvey's or New York Fries. So why, WHY must you, Smoke's? I want a decent vegetarian poutine in my neighborhood just like I want a decent veggie burger and I can't get either. Why? Because people, for some bloody reason, insist on making them both out of MUSHROOMS. Which I hate. Did I neglect to mention that?"}
{"text":"What negative things can you stay about Smoke's pourtinerie? Nothing at all. Came into this location at 1 am on a Saturday and was able to be in and out within 15 mins which is a better than the Toronto counter part where you're waiting 30 mins for your order."}
{"text":"I love smoke's poutine. I've been to a few in Toronto but this one is literally down the street from my house.  Awesome location, amazing food, seriously. Smoke's never disappoints. Every time I go I always try to get a different combo. Last time I got pulled pork, this time chicken fajita. Delicious! Went to the grand opening free poutine day when this location opened and was super surprised that they were giving away FULL SIZED poutine for free!  This company definitely knows what they need to do to succeed in the food industry! A+++"}
{"text":"Must have been an off-day when I tried, but this was probably 1 of the biggest disappointments.  Had a standard poutine, pulled pork and 2 regular fries for $30. All the fries were absolutely horrible. Hard to experiences the poutine when fries are not probably done, it was wayy over done, almost burnt. It was almost hard to chew.  It was very disappointing, as for the price we could have gotten much more value for it.The only good thing about it was the pulled pork  was delicious! Would certainly return for the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Beastly table manners, sloppy gravy and fries, carnivorous appetite? This is your gig. Smoke's delivers descent poutine at a reasonable cost.   You can tell how good the poutine is when the cheese is fresh and \"squeaky.\" Sort of like eating chewy soft rubber that melts in your mouth. Oxymoronic and doesn't sound very appetitite for does it? Believe it or not Montreal's best poutine delivers this experience which is oddly sensational. Smoke's may not have mastered squeaky, but the melting? Right on. With hot, sexy gravy dripping down the mountainous pile of fries in its lava-like state, this is pure bliss for those that are looking for that snack fix that fills you and yet doesn't trip you over the edge.   Snack size is sufficient for two given how heavy it is. Pulled pork on the sweeter size but well broiled, is tender, and adds a flare to the box of seductive goodness. The entire box may be on the saltier savory side, but who can say no to melting cheese over fries?   With tall chairs that litter the small space, it's a great way to chat with you neighbor or stand anyway to your hearts content.   Overall, good for a snack, but not for a meal. Don't over do it! Relaxing place but nothing crazy unique that is jaw-dropping revolutionary.  Heads up, their receipts are out to lunch. Based on the percentage displayed it looks like they're double changing taxes, but totals still equate to the 13%. Odd..."}
{"text":"When in Canada, you have to have poutine.  On my way to the airport we stopped by here for an order and it was such a huge disappointment.    Poutine is a Canadian thing which is fries, gravy, and cheese curds.  My cousin and I weren't too hungry, so we ordered the snack size traditional poutine to share.  I didn't like it all all and neither did my cousin who is a native Canadian so she's had her fair share of poutine.  The gravy tasted like gravy from a jar you buy during Thanksgiving.  Overall there was nothing special about their traditional flavor.  Perhaps their other combos are better since it has other additions.  Located in Port Credit across from the Burger Priests.  It's a very small show with only limited seating and maybe a handful of seats."}
{"text":"There was a huge variety of poutines here to choose from. I chose the Hogtown and it was amazing, no complaints at all. However, the service was not very good. The cashier was kinda grumpy and is not welcoming at all. The place was really small so I recommend taking the food home or outside to eat."}
{"text":"French fries, cheese, gravy and toppings, how can this be bad? It can't. I've been enjoying Smoke's pouting since it was just a food truck. And nothing has changed (that's a good thing!). The original is amazing but you have to try the nacho grande and the Philly cheesesteak! So many combos to choose from(veg, pork, chicken,beef).  One word of warning, it is way more filling than you think.  Meal size is plenty!"}
{"text":"As part of their soft launch, they were offering free poutine this afternoon and they were not even joking with their portions, e.g. meal size = 2 servings for me!  AND customers were able to order whatever poutine off their menu which was a bonus.  Staff were very friendly, engaging, and did a great job at getting the customers excited for their freebie.  :)  I ordered the Sausage Peppercorn (gravy flavour) and I think the base of fries were boxed up beforehand as some of the elements were cold (sausage)/lukewarm/warm - nothing was hot.  Of course, this was probably done in anticipation of serving throngs of people and I understand that.  I'm sure this will not be the case on a normal day!  With Burgers Priest across and Burrito Boyz down the street, this is a great addition to Port Credit.  Thanks Smoke's!  Note:  Size of actual restaurant is larger than BB, but not by much."}
{"text":"Walking along lakeshore, I worked up an appetite.. wanted something fried and happened upon Smoke's Poutinerie! It was relatively late on Sunday night and the shop was soon to close. What to order! I was overwhelmed by the menu's offerings! Kept it simple though & ordered a snack sized traditional. Having been my first time here, I was quite pleased, as were my tastebuds :) Service was made even better with the amount of poutine received; much more than expected! Seeing as there was a lot, shared my box with a friend. Fries covered in cheese curds and gravy definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"cheese curds and brown gravy over French fries make the perfect comfort foods on a chilly weather day! I love cheese, I love gravy and I love fries so this thing just can't go wrong, but it's kinda pricey like around $8ish for a medium sized box of meatless poutine."}
{"text":"Excellent Poutine! Fresh crisp fries, piping hot gravy ample toppings too! (I got the pulled pork)  The meal size was just right. Came hungry and barely finished it.  Clean, (important to me) quick and friendly. We were looking to stay and eat but there's very little seating. Three (double seat occupancy) tables is all. I guess mid Saturday afternoon is busy. Place was full when we got there and line up by the time we left with our food.   Parking on street, or in behind store."}
{"text":"Delicious, poutine with pulled pork. Standard option but a great and filling experience. This place has a nice vibe, old tech and film theme on the walls, makes for a way back play back experience if you grew up in the 80s/90s. Medium size poutine is very filling, next time if I go I would get a snack size! Enjoy 4/5"}
{"text":"yeah four stars seems about right.  not the best poutine you've ever had (cheese curds don't have that signature quebec squeek!) but still leaves you satisfied.  portion sizes are deceiving.  the meal size (medium) that initially appears shrimpy can satisfy most strong hungers....will end up being two portions for smaller individuals.  about 20 different varieties full of all sorts of toppings from pulled pork to chili cheese steak to sriracha chicken.  for me it's always traditional and i was not disappointed.  will be back."}
{"text":"Been long time want to visit this place. Medium size for almost $10 ...wow...expensive for a potato with gravy. The potato kinda soggy after few minutes stay with the gravy. Im not sure if I will coming back."}
{"text":"went over yesterday for the soft free poutine opening, i had mentioned to my significant other that we should bring some cash on us, because i was expecting the \"free poutine\" to be a \"tiny\" size and just traditional serving.  BOY WAS I WRONG after standing in the slow moving line for almost two hours in the cold. we had six servings of poutine split between four people.  the franchisee's father was handing out menu's and was Super polite in explaining to everyone in the line that we were able to have any style of poutine on the menu, so as we were reading it over making our decisions carefully, i was planning on going for my traditional offering of \"triple pork\" but then i thought hey! why not try something i don't normally have, which lead me to having the chicken peppercorn(slightly disappointed) and the hogtown(it was good). what i can say about both poutines is, these were the best servings of poutine i've had at any location, and i say this because this is the tenth location i've been to in ontario. the fries/potatoes were superb, i was thinking because the oil is so clean it was really rich in flavor which i have not experienced at any other location of smokes, the cheese was amazing as always, and aside from the addition toppings i move onto the gravy. for the hogtown it was good, rich and bold full of flavor, for the chicken peppercorn i was slightly disappointed in its inconsistency, it was good in portions and not so good in portions...it lacked an overall pepper bite/flavor to it. really enjoyable but thats my two cents.   great location, parking is sparse (as with all of them)   i really want to take a moment as well and just put it out that, even though this was completely free, i think the ball was dropped with \"we're not selling drinks today\" they would have made a significant amount on that portion of sales alone, but alas, i'm not in charge.   will defiantly go back, as my best friends live down the street"}
{"text":"All in all a happening joint, has a feel good factor to it. They prepare fresh so bit of a wait time. The poutine comes in 3 sizes. Snack, meal and the large. We ordered the chicken inferno meal size. Has a touch of gravy which I would not call particularly outstanding. There were very very few chicken pieces , seemed more likea 10$ fry with jalape√±os and sauce. Not sure if I would try again."}
