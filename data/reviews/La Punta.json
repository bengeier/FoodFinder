{"text":"At the close of a beautiful 4 days and 3 nights in Bellagio, staying at the wonderful Hotel Belvedere and exploring the picturesque towns, abbeys, and gardens -- we inquired around for the perfect restaurant and dinner to cap our Como experience... And landed at the worst restaurant experience we have had in Europe: La Punta of Bellagio, Como Italy.

In short:

- the restaurant could not find our reservation which I made personally by phone days in advance

- from the moment we arrived it was clear the restaurant was rushing our party of 5 through dinner to maximize our bill and minimize our time enjoying the meal

- we ordered three courses (antipasti, primi, secondi) - they all arrived at once (!) with apologies from our server that the kitchen was \"in a hurry\" - the food came so fast there was no room for the plates on the table

- the food was not just disappointing, it was inedible. Even simple dishes (prosciutto e melone) were clearly plated hours before dinner and had been sitting -- drying out and getting soggy at the same time

- we asked for a wine list and our waiter came back to the table with an open bottle of a \"local favorite\" white - I asked again for the list. She set the bottle and 5 glasses down and walked away.  We didn't drink the wine and had to request it be removed from our bill.

- once all courses arrived (at once), we never saw our waiter again - she was reassigned to another overwhelmed area of the restaurant

In short, the service and food were a disaster. What a sad waste of a beautiful location and potential.

With so many great places in and around Bellagio (Barchetta, Alle Darsene) - don't bother with this place. It won't be around for long."}
{"text":"Overall disappointing. Great view but that's it. The food is average at best and way overpriced. I poured some olive oil on my grilled fish to be able to swallow it. My husband, who never leaves food on the table, only ate half of his chicken because it was so dry. Pasta dishes are fine, but no better than what you can get anywhere else for half the price. Worst of all they charge $3 per person \"cover\" charge even if you order 2 courses each + wine."}
{"text":"What a charming place, with great Italian food, great and fun loving Italian staff, and a great atmosphere.  By far the best meal we have had since starting our travels in Italy.
I wanted to add a review to 2013 because this is the place to eat when you come to Bellagio.  Great views and on the lake.
What a great overall experience!"}
{"text":"Quality of the food and the service is excellent, but pricey. Great view of the center of the lake and harbors."}
{"text":"I have a summer home close by. Great location, one of the best in Bellagio. Service friendly, food dreadful and overpriced. No value for money. Walk around for the view but eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The view is wonderful looking out over Como.  Today was a bit cool and drizzly but comfortable.   Lagrien Rose 2015 to pair with Chefs Penne was perfect, my better half had Ricotta ravioli with walnuts and creame sauce.  Our waiter was helpful with local history and information.  I would do this again."}
{"text":"The food here was mediocre and over priced. Just as was mentioned in another review, I doused my food in olive oil to make it more palatable. We should have read the reviews in more detail before coming."}
{"text":"Es war schon immer etwas teurer, mit fantastischer aussicht seinen Kaffee zu schlürfen.
So sitzen wir nun mit den Cappuccini für 4EUR auf der Terrasse und bewundern die fantastische Sicht auf die drei Zipfel des Comer Sees und die dahinter liegenden Berge.
Da man doch ein paar Schritte laufen muss, bis man an dieser Spitze der Halbinsel angekommen ist, ist es auch sehr viel ruhiger als im quirligen Bellagio selber, das selbst im September noch mächtig von Tagestouristen gebrummt hat. Jede Menge Englisch und Asiatisch, erstaunlicherweise, was man da gehört hat. Follow the yellow umbrella- pleeese follof- dont stop
Was bin ich mal froh, dass ich keine Postkartengroßen leuchtorangen Aufkleber mit dem Aufdruck Visitor tragen muss g aber ich schweife ab.
Das Retaurant selbst ist definitiv gehoben und die Nutzung für einen profanen Nachmittagscappu eher ein Missbrauch der Räumlichkeiten. Die Bedienung indes selbst lässt sich das nicht anmerken, räumt aber brav mit einem Stirnrunzeln die bereits drapierten Weingläser etc. wieder zur Seite. (16.00 ca.) 
Die direkt mit dem Cappu ausgehändigte Weinkarte ist sehr umfangreich und scheint vollständig, ich lese staunend die edlen Tröpfchen, die man hier genießen kann. Geendet hat es preislich irgendwo bei einem Chateau Petrus von 1991 für runde 3000,00EUR 
die Flasche. Immerhin ;-) Leider nicht ganz mein Portemonnaie, aber das Ambiente dafür ist fraglos vorhanden.
Zu den Speisen kann ich leider nichts sagen, da wir, wie gesagt nur den Kaffeehunger gestillt haben."}
{"text":"The food was a 4, very good.  I had the white lake fish and green salad.  The service was a 5-very friendly and on top of any need.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and breath taking views!!! Absolutely amazing experience!!! The only bad thing was that the credit card machine did not work. They claimed that they did not have service and the rest of the restaurants on the island are the same but when I bought food from another restaurant, my card worked fine. Disappointing because I needed those euros. I would go back though."}
{"text":"We (my mom and I) were looking for a delicious meal - and what we instead received was a lousy, laughable meal. First of all, the sign pointing us in the direction of the restaurant, when walking up the hill from the center of town, says \"200 meters.\" No way. Even Google Maps says it's 350 meters distance. (We should have just turned around.) When we got to the restaurant, we were asked if we had a reservation. (No, because it was a last minute decision and more so because it's offseason, we didn't think we'd need one.) The response was cold, almost 'who are you to show up without a reservation?!'. But, the restaurant was dead - and thus the attitude was unnecessary. The meal was fine. Nothing to write home about. Though I do think the waiter should have been able to explain to me the difference between the 3 types of 6 Euro glasses of red wines on the menu. His grasp of English was definitely at that level, with the effort and knowledge being sub-par. When the bill came, it contained a 4 Euro charge for water for 2 people, which we did not have, and had to ask to have taken off the bill. The bill also contained a 5 Euro charge for coperto for 2 people. We saw this NO WHERE on the menu when we were scoping it out online or when we were looking at it in person. Turns out, the notice is hidden in the background design on the menu, located below the cheese list. So, if you don't want cheese, there's no way of seeing it. And if you do want cheese, it's very much hidden. What a ruse! When we asked about the water and coperto, we were met with attitude once again. The water came off quickly, with one of the waiters apologizing, saying it's traditional to put it on there, everyone gets water with their meals. As for the coperto, he told us that it's traditional around Europe to charge a coperto and that he realizes it's not something we see in the United States on bills. He had a real attitude. Was a real dick, for lack of a better term. I don't suggest anyone to go to this restaurant There are much better restaurants up in the hills that will give you just as good a view, but with a better meal and much better service. I've never disliked a dining experience so much."}
{"text":"My wife and I were married in Lake Como on June 29th. Our Wedding planner (Sally from WeddingBox Lake Como) set us up with a 32-person rehearsal dinner at La Punta for the night before the wedding. La Punta is a 10 minute walk from the boat dock in Bellagio (turn left and follow the main street). When you arrive from the street, you actually walk up the back of the restaurant - there are a couple of signs, but rest assured that you will eventually see the restaurant below the street and towards the water. You will then have to walk down a cute little windy cobblestone stairway or you can follow street down and around the side. There is a beautiful grassy area with shade trees and benches that the guests could relax at before dinner. The kids liked it because they could run around (we arrived a little early). When we arrived, we were taken to a private table in the back that overlooked the lake. The grounds were immaculately maintained and everywhere you looked was like a picture out of a movie. When we arrived, we ordered the wine for the table; the food menu had been pre-selected. The waiter, Niko was very entertaining and spoke perfect English. He helped us with the wine, which was very good and wound up costing around 25 euro per bottle. We also got a very large bottle of well-priced Chianti Classico for 160 euro; Niko presented us with this very large bottle in its own wooden case before the primi and it was a huge hit with our guests - we drank the whole bottle then brought the bottle and case back to the states with us. At the end of the night, we were able to take home the unfinished bottles of wine and water, which came in handy later on at the hotel. We chose caprese salad for our antipasti, meat lasagne for our primi piatti and the de-boned \"Lavarello\" fish in butter and sage for our secondi (Lavarello is an excellent local, flaky white fish). The children were served two courses of similar food, but prepared in more kid-friendly ways. We finished with espresso and opted to leave out the dessert so we could casually walk back to the boat dock and get gelato. Note that the last boat to Lenno from Bellagio was at 7:40pm. By sitting down to eat at 5:30pm, although a little early for our liking, we had plenty of time to get gelato and arrive back at the boat dock on time. The food and the view were incredible. All in all, the meal was VERY affordable, which was one of our requirements, and the experience was priceless."}
{"text":"A wonderful place by the Lake Como. 
 
To get here from Milan we took the train to Verenna-Esino. 1 hour. Then the ferry to Bellagio. 5 minutes. 

At La Punta, we had a outside table with view over the lake and the mountains. 

I ordered a nice pasta dish. Very good. 
My better half had a lasagna, also good, however a pretty small portion. 
Our friends had fish of the day, fresh from the lake. Also good. The other ones had a salad, which were, nothing special actually. Mostly leaves and cucumber. 

For me, both location, service (they have the BEST waiter) and food was excellent. So - 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is great. You have to go if you're in Bellagio. We ordered the mixed cheese plate, spinach artichoke crepes, meat tortellini, 2 half bottles of wine. Everything was so good! The crepe was very salty which I like but my *husband* doesn't (newlyweds!!).
We came back at dinner to have more Parmesan cheese, wine and French fries. I will say the fries are very american like frozen fries but I needed a taste of home so I don't mind."}
{"text":"Ambiance. Beautiful setting on the tip of Bellagio. The view, by itself is 10 stars. But Yelp is about food, isn't it?

Food: lake Como fish dominates the menu and you should try it. But it's lake fish and has small bones. Preparation is very simple. So let's say, the food is OK (3 stars, top)

Service: it was fake nice. 

Price: not too bad. 

So, your options for lunch  are somewhat limited to a bunch of ghastly looking places filled with exhausted tourists on the main drag or La Punta. Go with it but remember that you are here for the view."}
{"text":"The food is the best I've had on Como.

I had the lasagna and some grilled vegetables.

The chocolate cake was great however the bread sucked."}
{"text":"Bellagio location is phenomenal! Nice walk to and from the restaurant to build an appetite and burn off same! Beautiful view of Lake Como from the patio. Staff were friendly and willing to assist. Multi-lingual staff makes it perfect for all!"}
{"text":"The food, wine, and views of La Punta was excellent. A bit overpriced but still great. Unfortunately we did not enjoy the waitstaff as much. We noticed an error on our bill, they added a liter of water without us asking or receiving any, after the correction was made the waiter seemed more then eager to have us leave. We asked if they accepted card and he told us, \"No, only cash.\" Which I found odd at a more high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great! Staff was friendly. However, we did feel that the staff was trying to speed us along. The restaurant has a beautiful view and it seems like they are trying to turn tables quickly."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of lake Como. Food is good but nothing special. Service is very good, friendly but not annoying like in the US. I recommend it if you want to have a nice view over lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"You could go to this place and eat dog poop and I'd still rate it 5 stars because of the views! Luckily, the food was actually pretty good. 

Your sitting on lake como, in Bellagio (huge casinos are named after this beautiful place) and your starring directly at the famous Swiss Alps....

Unless your some billionaire who sees stuff like this everyday, it's pure magic! 

I highly recommend you visit this place for lunch on a sunny day just to take a look at the best scenery in the world."}
{"text":"If you want an amazing view of the Swiss Alps along with Italian mountains in all sides, this is the place. Service was good but food was average. It's definitely the location that's draws the crowd."}
{"text":"The restaurant is situated at the very tip of Bellagio, providing a beautiful view of the water and surrounding area.

I had the Penne Chef Style, in a creamy tomato-based sauce with a hint of bacon, which I thought was very good.  The bread that came with the meal was disappointing.  Prices are higher than other restaurants in the area, and the glass of wine that I ordered was more like a half-glass.  Some other reviewers have complained about the cover charge, but that is pretty standard for Italy (it's essentially the tip that is automatically included)."}
{"text":"The meals were good but not spectacular. The view is one of a kind. I would definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"The most gorgeous view ever!!!  Lake Como and the snow capped Alps in the background.
Seriously amazing!!  The food and the service is also fabulous!! This is my go to for a relaxing day drinking vino and taking it all in!"}
{"text":"The view was great but the food was meh.  The prosecco made the experience pleasant.  The wait staff was super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Food arrived before wine. Salad showed up later . Overpriced and nothing special. Final insult was 6e tablecloth fee. Great view but otherwise mediocre"}
{"text":"In a beautiful Bellagio ( not the fake one in Las Vegas) you will find a varity of tourist oriented restaurants.  In this type of restaurant you never expect to get a high quality food but you do expect an amazing setup and a view. 

This is exactly what this restaurant provides. 
Good food. It will not leave you breathless but along with the spectacular location it provides an ultimate vocation dinning spot. 

About 60-80 euro per person for a four course dinner. Not too bad for vacation spending."}
{"text":"Crazy wintery day in September. The chef's penne  pasta was full of flavor. Bacon was not overpowering, which was my concern when ordering. The lake fish lavorello in butter and sage melts in your mouth. Pair with the local Opera white wine. Great, friendly service tops it off."}
{"text":"Ristorante La Punta was the perfect ending punctuation to our rather relaxing and wonderful northern Italian trip. We had one night in Bellagio before flying out of Milan, and we wanted to try a place off the beaten path. It was July, the breeze was blowing gently from the lake and the walk from the center of town was romantic and quaint, on a quiet road that winds around the lake. Once you arrive at the restaurant you can request to be seated on the patio, and we were lucky enough to be seated directly in the center with Lake Como spread out before us. The wait staff was charming and attentive. We did have 3 different waiters throughout service, which was a bit disarming but overall it worked out well -- but only because each of them injected a bit of their own personality to their portion. The atmosphere was extremely relaxing. There is nothing more perfect than sipping a nice white wine, eating Lavarello (local white fish) and gazing out at Lake Como with the sun setting. The food complimented the environment perfectly. It was well timed, artfully prepared and delicately flavored. After dinner we took a walk on the pier which is situated 50 yards from the restaurant, and watched the quiet dusk settle into night. We couldn't have asked for a better way to end our last night in Italy."}
{"text":"We did a day trip to the Lake Como area, and ended up here for a \"light\" lunch. Pastas were both very good. House wine was okay.

View was spectacular, and it's a nice quiet spot to watch the water. Definitely recommended for the view and the dining experience."}
