{"text":"I had the Wisconsin Fish Fry. The fish was good as fish fries go.
Everything is homemade, the coleslaw was a great mix between sweet and sour.
When I tasted the dinner rolls I knew these too were homemade. They were wonderful!
The French's fries and Mexican rice were also very good.
I have to put it up there for fish fries!"}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to try this restaurant.  What a mistake.  Outdated, dancing greeter in baseball cap (so ethnic), horrible music for the ambience, food was horrible, service great until I couldn't find my server with my debit card which scared me.  Just a mess.  The PRO:  Salsa was excellent.  Then we leave, both with upset stomachs.  Will never go back, EVER"}
{"text":"Service was ok but not attentive. 

Food was hit and miss. Fish way undercoooked.  Took a while for them to fix it. 

Chicken tacos were pretty good. Although when I asked to get two different kinds of tacos I was told that is not OK as they are pre-portioned. Seriously?  

Margarita was fair. Prices just ok. 

Had hoped it would be good, but there are a lot of better options."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the weird salsa sauce stuff. Food was okay but service was slow, although it was a Wednesday and there were only two employees that I noticed, so...
Margarita wasn't great. \"Fresh vegetables\" seemed like a bag of frozen veggies to me, which is fine, but just call them mixed vegetables then. 
Meh."}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends. We both have young children. The first clue things weren't going to go well is that they don't have any high chairs. They were able to dig up some booster seats which thankfully worked for our kids.

First impression was that the menu was pretty bland. My husband ordered steak in his burrito but the waitress brought it with pork instead. When my husband mentioned it to the waitress, he was too nice to send it back and she was naive enough to say \"are you sure?\" when he said he would eat it. No! We ordered steak, take the plate back to the kitchen and get it right!!

I asked for flour tortillas with my enchiladas instead of corn, I got corn instead of flour.

Both of these are east things to get right but they fumbled pretty bad. On top of everything the menu was overpriced and the food under delivered. If you want good Mexican food head to Laredos or Habaneros down the street. I'll be surprised if this place sticks around for too long."}
{"text":"It seems Lagarto has moved to its new location as of this week. We tried it out, because who could pass up dinner at a pink restaurant?

The good: vegetarian tamales!  I love masa and am always disappointed when there is no veggie option. The filling was a bit weak, but the masa part and the mole were great. My companion had a chorizo-crusted tilapia.  I can't comment on the chorizo pet, but the fish was nicely cooked and my companion at it all.  There is a side option of veggies, which is a nice option for those not wanting to be overloaded by rice and beans, although they were obviously frozen mixed vegetables.  Also nice is that there is a patio.  It's shaded in the evening (yay!) and its secluded enough that you don't notice how close to the place is to stoughton road 

The not great: the location is going to be tough for the near future.  It's right off cottage grove road, which is a big construction mess.  Also, the turn for Altas avenue is well before you can see the pink building when traveling west.  Also awkward was the excessive number of waiters. I imagine this will work itself out, it's not really fair to judge service too harshly on a place that is open for its first weekend. 

I wish them luck!"}
{"text":"After watching them have contractors in the place for months, I was surprised to walk in and find out that they had not done any renovations. Place is still dark.  Booths are still uncomfortable.  Chairs are still very sterile and plastic.   Place is still dark and dreary.

Server was cheery.  Food was a bit overpriced but acceptable.   Your typical Mexican menu with nothing unique to offer you or a reason to go back"}
{"text":"Salsa was good. Salsa dancing? Or dancing in general? Major disappointment. Poor music, low quality sound. No patrons which makes for a boring night. And aside from the salsa, the food was terrible and my husbands beer was beyond warm, almost hot! Like it was stored outside. We went the week after it opened, so hopefully I can update my review with higher stars after they get their act together...but I'll be honest, it's going to take one heck of a bribe to get me to go back."}
{"text":"I'm currently enjoying the most delicious veggie quesadilla of my life with a cold Dos Equis. Service is attentive and kind, and the trivia host is smokin' hot.

JK, I am the trivia host, but the rest is my unbiased opinion. I liked the Bayou, but there were't tons of vegetarian options on the menu. if you're veggie and want a good meal, shopping the Lagartos menu will be fun."}
