{"text":"I went here to grab a quick lunch during my work day. The gentleman that worked there sat down with me and made and served me fresh lebanese coffee while I waited for my shawarma. We had a short conversation, and he told me times, \"welcome, welcome!\" The young lady made my food for me while I had coffee. He told me to come back for coffee again, and I think I will take him up on it!

My shawarma was totally delicious! It was great that they offer a medium size shawarma instead of everywhere else only having a large, because I'm a small person and can't eat that much all at once! But they also offer a large shawarma if you're a big eater, and platters as well. And next time I'm getting some of that delicious looking baklava for sure!"}
{"text":"Best donairs ever! The schwarmas are pretty good along with the falafels. Its run by really nice staff. Its a good eating atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch. We both ordered the chicken kabob plate. It came with two skewers of marinated chicken, a piece of roasted potato, some salad, pickled turnip and rice slightly mixed with some noodles. All of it was prepared fresh. The chicken was delicious. I don't recall the last time I had such moist and flavourful kabob. The service was excellent. My wife ordered Lebanese tea, and the server brought it to the table and served the tea - putting sugar in our cups and pouring the tea.

I'd come here again. It was delicious and wonderful. There's lots natural light coming through the window. It has free parking. The restaurant is very clean."}
