{"text":"We had ordered dumplings & my daughter screamed that something hit her teeth. She showed me & I saw a plastic piece came out of dumpling that we had ordered. When I complained the reaction from the staff was \"Oh these things happen. Why you are making such a fuss if she is not hurt. Accidents do happen. A lot of people get hit by cars while crossing the street.\" I wish there were \"Zero\" stars so I could select that. I would request people be careful while you are eating at this place."}
{"text":"Good value tasty dumplings."}
{"text":"Came in here last week thinking it was a \"Chinese\" restaurant and not a Chinese \"dumpling\" restaurant. We ended up with 2 baskets of  yummy dumplings but were expecting something else. The restaurant is OK. A bit off the beaten path with OK service and greasy plastic menus. Not expensive. Cash only.  Montreal is not the place to get Asian food. We had burgers and steaks the next 2 nights which were much better than this place."}
{"text":"We walked in with low expectations, and was completely blown away by their succulent and delicious dumplings. It was fresh, and we had them steamed. It was wonderful. Would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"If i am craving for dumplings, this is the place that i will definitely visit. The surprising one is the curry stuffed dumpling. Never had it before, love it!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? At the sight of the steamy dumplings? Or the fried ones? At the first bite with the explosion of goodness in my mouth? 
The dumplings here are nothing short of tasty. Each dumpling will surely send a wave of comfort and joy through you. Warming the soul, satisfying your belly, in a very delicious manner, these dumplings are fantastic and unforgettable. I ordered half fried dumplings filled with chicken and coriander  with the other half cooked in vapor and filled with pork, shrimp, and leek. The soup that is let out once you bite into the dumpling is marvelous. Full of flavour and texture, these dumplings are a 2 for 1.
For a total of 16 dumplings for about 13$, my wallet too was satisfied. 
I also wanted to see if their desserts were as delicious. So I asked for the red bean cake, to my surprise, the waitress, in all seriousness, replied that they had none and that I should never order a dessert at a Chinese restaurant. I burst into laughter. I appreciated her brute honesty, though. I learned thereafter that I would not be coming back for dessert, but the dumplings...oh the dumplings, it's true love."}
{"text":"The decor is unassuming but you'll love the food. This is a must-try place we show our out-of-town friends and they always return for more. Dumplings are delicious."}
{"text":"Some relatives and I were staying in the area for the night and this place was in our price range. Despite the tacky lights outside, we completely passed by this place due to it being on the lower level. Also apparently, I pronounced the name of this restaurant wrong and everyone thought I was saying the name of a very prestigious university in China.
As we inched towards the restaurant, I knew all of us felt the same vibe -- it was the feeling of uncertainty mixed with a little panic. I could tell because everyone was walking slower and slower. Do we really want to eat here?  It appeared completely empty.  Doubts were expressed but Yelp wouldn't let me down! So we walked inside.  I was relieved to find a second, more occupied room that we originally could not see through the window, but that feeling immediately dissolved upon doing my classic race-check.  Seeing only white people in a Chinese restaurant is always a little unsettling if you've come expecting good Chinese food

We ordered 90 dumplings total for the six of us. Half were fried; the rest were steamed or boiled.  I even liked the chicken/mushroom dumpling I had and I normally hate mushrooms (blegh!)
These dumplings don't require any sauces to make them taste good.  They're really juicy and if you bite into them just right, juice will squirt out the other side and into your cousin's eye.  If you don't like fitting an entire dumpling in your mouth, you can also take a super small bite and suck out the juices before you eat the rest. I've made a lot of dumplings in my time but I have no idea how they manage to make every single dumpling sealed with juices.

The dumplings were really light in terms of salt (just the way I like them) so if you do want to add some sauce, I recommend dipping your dumplings in a mixture of 3/4 soy sauce and 1/4 red chili sauce (half of it being the chili oil and the other half the chili).  I'm not a big fan of vinegar but I was told to put at least a few drops in it because that's what you're supposed to do for dumplings.

Our food came relatively quickly but they did seem understaffed in terms of service.  The waitress was so busy that I couldn't flirt with her--I was very disappointed about that.  There was another guy at the cash register who helped out with our order and when we asked for refills for our tea (I winked at him twice).

15 dumplings will cost around $10. They charge an extra $1.50 for fried dumplings, which surprised us a little at the end. Fried dumplings filled with pork and cabbage was my favorite of the bunch, followed by steamed shrimp dumplings.  Definitely don't be fooled by its appearance and try this place out!"}
{"text":"It should be noted that the dumplings take on average 20 mins to arrive at your table as they are both WRAPPED and STEAMED to order. This means, the little magical dumpling fairies were busy at work, because 20 mins ago, your dumplings were still a ball of dough and a bowl of meat (apologies to any male chefs in the kitchen, I'm not calling you a fairy, I'm just saying)."}
{"text":"My dumplings had no soup in them & were so dry tasting. The waitstaff weren't very nice either, they seemed annoyed every time u ask them for anything. I ordered one round just to test it out & it didn't really do it for me, i left right after to eat something else, what a waste of time."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. I liked the steamed better than the fried. Although the service is ok, I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The dumplings here are amazing! I always get the steamed ones, and eat the whole thing without spilling the juice out. And the taste is heavenly... I recommend the shrimp and pork dumpling and lamb and onion! This restaurant and the one in Chinatown are exactly the same."}
{"text":"Really love going here for lunch or dinner, and their lunch menu definitely makes it worth it. The soup dumplings are very good. I've tried almost every soup dumpling on the menu, and have no real complaints about any of them. My personal favorites are curry beef and beef onion. The service is usually fine, but since the dumplings are handmade to order, sometimes it takes 20+ minutes to receive the order, depending on how busy it is."}
{"text":"Not bad dumpling restaurant but nothing special. Because all the dumplings are hand made so the waiting time might be long if there are many people"}
{"text":"J'hésite entre donner trois ou quatre. J'aurais dû prendre les dumplings frits.  J'ai essayé les dumplings vapeur sans savoir que c'était des soups dumplings.  Je me suis tellement brûlée avec le premier dumpling! Le deuxième a explosé sur la table. Après j'ai fini par prendre le tour mais c'est beaucoup plus facile manger des dumplings frits surtout si on est pas super habile avec des baguettes.  Côté goût c'est bon,  je m'attends toujours à ce que ça goûte plus intéressant mais avec deux ingrédients c'est difficile. Ne prenez pas la soupe aigre piquante ça ne ressemble pas du tout à ce que ça devrait être.  Sinon bon service et peu dispendieux."}
{"text":"Good dumplings made by hand on demand.

One of my favorite place when I was living in Montréal and I still haven't found dumplings that good since I left.

Pretty quiet on week days but be prepared to wait  on weekends rush hours."}
{"text":"I love it! I find its one of the best dumpling place in Montreal!!!

You need some time to sit around because it takes some time for it to arrive because they hand make them when you order them!!!! Hence very fresh! many interesting flavors to choose from! and you could have them steamed or fried!!

If you go end of the week or weekend.. expect a lineup! so go early!!"}
{"text":"Service is slower, but the dumplings are good. Like the lamb and coriander and pork and cabbage best so far (flavourful broth inside). I would recommend calling ahead for take out rather than dining in. The complimentary side dish of pickled cabbage/carrots is refreshing as well!"}
{"text":"I'm no dumpling expert, but these little beauties are some of the best I've ever had. Personal favourites are any of the ones with corriander. Make sure to get a mix of fried and steamed. One of my favourite places to eat downtown. Great place to go with a friend or two. Check it out."}
{"text":"I wish we had a place like this in Calgary!  Fresh made dumplings, steamed or fried, with basically any stuffing that you want in them.  The only complaint is that they are fairly large portions, and that it is almost impossible with one a few people to sample all that we wanted to sample in our short visit!"}
{"text":"Go with a few friends and get a variety of steamed and fried. While the steamed are much more delicious than fried, it's nice to have a few fried ones as well. Although they're the same place as the one on Lincoln, I think they're tastier at this location (although this one has less seafood varieties). We've tried nearly all the options of chicken, pork, and lamb and you really can't go wrong. (Although I'm not a big fan of the curry ones, to be honest). Super affordable and a great bargain (about $10 pp)."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the positive reviews. Had  a mix of pork & coriander and shrimp & pork dumplings and they were delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of those hole in the wall spots that everyone LOVES to find. Great food, cheap, delicious, and oh-so-comforting. This is one of my must-visit places any time I'm in Montreal.

I did prefer the old location where you could watch the chefs cooking, but I do understand why they needed the extra space!"}
{"text":"Yum-o! Juicy broth filled Asian dumplings in Montreal... just like Toronto!

My friend and I ordered the Shrimp dumpings and the Oyster dumplings. 15 come in an order, very good fillings and fun to share.  Really flavorful broth in the dumplings, not too salty.  The skin of the dumpling is a little thicker than the ones I've had in Toronto, but still good.  Don't take a huge bite or you'll spray broth all over yourself and make a mess.

Not the most chic restaurant in town, an odd design with tiles from a fish market in the front and then some wood covered walls in the main dining room.  Try to stay get into the \"wood area\", the \"tiled area\" is very busy with take out orders and blast of wind if it's winter.  But this place is even full on a weekday.  Only about 10 tables so come early.

You can even buy frozen ones of your favorite dumplings to take home to steam at home."}
{"text":"Dumpling skin was too dry & thick. Stuffed ingredients were flavorless. I suggest you to go to Mei Xiang Yuan instead which is on St-Catherine street."}
{"text":"Qing Hua is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in Montreal and in terms of dumplings I doubt you will find a better place to go. Though a small restaurant I've never really had a problem getting a seat, even around lunch time, and it's always a relatively pleasant experience.

The only thing to really be sour about is the service which I thought was lackluster. We ordered our dumplings and were promised soup since that is an integral part of the meal but we never got it...That's a damn shame. Thankfully this did not happen more than once. Even then though the service is relatively slow and to get a seat is sometimes more of a pain than it should be. 

The dumplings though are exquisite and are both juicy and flavorful. I usually order the pork and cabbage ones; half fried and half steamed. It's always excellent and the price is perfect. I've also tried the pork and coriander ones and these were excellent as well and somehow strangely refreshing. 

Overall, this is a place definitely worth checking out even if you are not a fan of Chinese cuisine. Dumplings are easy to get into and enjoy and there is no reason you won't like eating a lunch at Qing Hua. Given how low the prices are it's definitely worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"This used to be THE place to go for dumplings in Montreal, but I was sadly disappointed last week.  The service was slow even though the restaurant was half-empty, the pork & cabbage steamed dumplings were ok, but the lamb ones were almost inedible -- I didn't get sick, but the meat tasted so weird and bland I had a hard time swallowing.  Maybe it was just an off night, or maybe the quality is slipping. From four stars to two :("}
{"text":"The food is really good. It is probably one of the best dumplings you can get in Montreal but we had to wait about 35 - 45 mins to get the food. If you are going, make sure to call for a reservation. :)"}
{"text":"Uni soup dumplings!  Yes, there is far more pork in these and only a soupcon of uni but they are good."}
{"text":"Had a really underwhelming first time experience here. My friend and I each ordered hot and sour soup, and an order of cabbage and dill dumplings and an order of shrimp, leek and egg dumplings. A couple minutes later I was told they didn't have the shrimp dumplings I wanted, so I chose cabbage and mushroom. Then another couple minutes later we were told the hot and sour soup was not ready and were asked if we wanted something else instead; we declined. Then maybe 5 or 10 minutes later the server came back and said the soup was ready and asked if we still wanted it; we said yes. The soup arrived and was lukewarm at best, the onions still crunchy and not yet cooked. We sent the soup back. Our dumplings arrived at different times, but ultimately they were pretty good. Can't complain about the dumplings. Service was mediocre - at one point during our meal we overheard another table send their hot and sour soup back because it was not hot... A shame the servers/kitchen didn't take our comment into consideration and make the necessary fix. If you're going to eat here, I suggest sticking with the dumplings and not trying your luck with anything else. Better places in the area to get dumplings."}
{"text":"Probably  the best Chinese dumplings I've ever had.  Decor is non-descript, and staff inattentive at best, but more than worth it for the food.  We tried several kinds, and loved them all!  FYI, they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings too greasy. Pan fried dumplings are good."}
{"text":"This place was good, but i think it is over rated on yelp.  The dumplings were good, but too salty for my taste.

Yes, there's a lot of choices and maybe we were not lucky, but my gf and I were not that impressed."}
{"text":"Huge fan of soup dumplings.
My top picks are the orignal pork one and lamb.
It was a cold day and I was craving soup dumplings.
When we enter the restaurant, we were seated at a table on the side, which was pretty nice. 
The waitress didn't pay attention to us until I walked to her and said that we were ready to order. 
I came with a few friends and it was their first time trying soup dumpling (xiao long bao).
The table was covered with steam/water/soup from the previous people. Not pleasant. 
We also ordered spicy tofu to try it out. I didn't like it, but my friends did. 
When the soup dumplings arrived, WOOOOOOAAHHH amazing.
The original pork and lamb tasted damn good. 
Best way to eat was to bite a small hole, suck up the soup and enjoy the dumplings.
I didn't use much of the vinegar as I enjoyed the original soup taste better. 
Beware of soup splash if you go for a single bite.
We also asked for hot tea. Thumbs up (y)
Good quality food for soup dumplings, always go for specialty.
Bad service. Waitress don't care about you until you go to her.
Good kpop background music.
I would definitely come back again for the soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Holy moly the best soup dumplings I have had outside China.  I crave it now that I'm back in the States.  I could attempt to find something comparable in New York City the next time I'm there but I fear I won't. 
The shrimp and pork dumplings were better than the vegetarian we tried, as vegetarian was a bit dry; it's hard to get really good vegetarian food in a place that is known for their pork/meat, I suppose. 
I agree that the reason this place is not 5 stars all the way is simply because of the lackluster (VERY SLOW) service. They're not downright rude or mean, which is acceptable, just not motivated to step it up a notch. 
Oh, well, I guess they they don't need to be your friend, as the food speaks for itself. 
I wish Amazon could deliver these to me in Massachusetts via drones..."}
{"text":"Decor is OK. Accepts only cash. There is a surcharge if you want them fried.
Funny thing is the pan fried ones are just pan-fried steamed dumplings.
I noticed that the insides were very juicy/watery as if it was a steamed dumpling.

Guess they batch produce steam dumplings of all varieties.

Dumplings were just ok."}
{"text":"This is at the end of the western section of st Catherine st. The dumplings are simply amazing!!!

Go steamed not pan fried. I like the pork and leek and chicken and mushroom.  Also get the hot and sour soup (the large is for a family of 4) so go small. 

Get a big Kirin Ichiban (because You look cool and it's bigger, better, and more American)

Also remember these Frenchies throw around a quarter like it is a manhole cover. Throw the waitress 10 bucks upfront and she will ignore all the other tables and hook you up all dinner (pretty sure she offered to walk on my back at the end...joking...)

Seriously this place is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Horribly disappointed. I wasn't sure what I was expecting but after reading the reviews on Yelp, I was super excited to go to Qing Hua.

First of all, the dumplings are soup dumplings and at the same time, barely qualify as soup dumplings. They aren't listed as soup dumplings and you aren't given a soup spoon so unless you were forewarned, you will bite into the dumpling and have the broth explode all over the table and possibly your clothes. In all honesty, I did appreciate the variety of dumplings they offered and the prices were reasonable. The dumplings itself tasted good but nothing to scream about. I've had better at Joe's Shanghai and basically a bunch of other places growing up in New York.

Also, I know I should have known better than to order anything other than dumplings but I decided to get the \"dimsum\" that was listed on the menu. They were listed as \"shumai\" in Chinese and I was expecting shumai but instead got some mushroom and veggie mixture straight out of the Buddhist temple my mother and I go to. 

Lastly, the service was exactly what I expected from a non fine-dining Chinese restaurant. The waitress will not go out of her way to give you the best service but that's the way it works so it wouldn't be fair of me to factor service into the overall rating. The two stars are just about the food."}
{"text":"Completely delicious. I came here based on other people's Yelp reviews and they did not lie. Hot and sour soup is a MUST. I almost ordered a second bowl. I had shrimp and vegetarian dumplings which were amazing as well.

I can't wait to go back. Cheap too. But bring cash."}
{"text":"Crazy good dumplings. Sweet prices. Just don't go late or you will have to wait.

Our group of 6 shared these flavors:
Pork with pickled cabbage 
Curry beef
Lamb with scallions
Lamb with cumin

We also had some kind of cucumbers or maybe they were pickled baby zucchini? Heck if I know, but they were good.

They could use some hotter \"hot\" sauce, but perhaps it's made on site and fluctuates by batch?

The stars are for food only. The restaurant space is not sexy. Bare bones furniture etc. bathroom is kinda gross. But Montreal is a big old city and this restaurant is wedged into a tiny space below sidewalk level. In fact it's easy to miss if you're not on foot.

I don't usually rate a place if I haven't been 2-3 times, but it could be awhile before I get back to Montreal. When I do, I am definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This is an exceptional full-flavored dish with just the right balance of heat. It is honestly one of the best dishes I have ever been served in any restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch with a friend of mine who is familiar with the area.  What a pleasant surprise.  The dumplings were amazing!  Our waitress seemed a little confused at times, but it was an overall great experience.  5 stars for how fantastic the food is."}
{"text":"I took an extra long walk down St. Catherine to find this small street level shop.  It almost seems out of place mixed in a quiet area with almost all Middle Eastern restaurants and bakeries.  There is only one waitress barely caring for all of the customers and she does not have time for your needs.  

A complimentary pot of tea is served.  I also appreciate the namesake specific dinner wear that is served with the logo.  There are different condiments on the table for you to mix together as your own sauce recipe.  I recommend 1/3 ratio of each.  The dumplings here are served in large quantities per order, which range from $9-12 CAD.  Some previous reviews noted that they compare with soup dumplings, or Xiao Long Bao.  From the appearance of the crescent shaped pillows, this did not appear true.  However, once you bite into the skin, your mouth will fill with hot, delicious soupy goodness.  After eating XLB a multitude of times in NYC, this familiar experience was long overdue.  The skin is thicker and has more chew to it, but that is actually what I prefer.

I ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings, which were perfectly seasoned with a sweet and salty balance topped off with a ginger fragrance.  My only complaint is that the shrimp inside were not deveined.  One order is definitely enough per person, and more than that would be overkill.  I do regret not ordering a vegetable based appetizer to break up all of the meat intake.  Maybe the cold cucumber salad would be a good pairing in the future."}
{"text":"I adore this place. It's cheap and delicious and hits the spot. Their dumplings are made on the spot, and every flavor combination I've had so far has been delicious. I've also tried their won ton soup, hot and sour soup and peanut butter dumplings and all have been out of this world amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious tasty well seasoned dumplings. Very fresh. Well made. Explosion of flavor when the dumpling's inside soup gets in your mouth. Quaint little underground place. You have to be patient, but it is understandable, as the dumplings are prepared as you order."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place !!!! The pork and coriander steamed dumpling is out of this world ! You can see the cooks making the dumplings on-order through the glass window that sees right into the kitchen. The restaurant itself is very clean, service is quick and polite and the prices are more than reasonable for the quality of food that you receive. Big thumbs up !! if you're ever in the neighborhood do yourself a favor and go ...you'll be dreaming about it the next day."}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked this place.  We found it through a NYT article on Montreal, and we were happy we went.

Started with the cucumber salad, which was perfectly marinated and tasted so healthy.  We had a plate full of mushroom & cabbage dumplings - amazing.  This is a no-frills place, but the food is great and the price is right.  The staff was very friendly, too.  Definitely a good place for when you're tired of the bistro fare..."}
{"text":"Dumplings were good. Services was okay. One course came raw (chicken) we return it and they gave us a new one. Overall was ok. Good food for the price."}
{"text":"Solid dumplings at a great deal. Two orders for two people = almost too much food. We ended up stuffing ourselves though and making it work :) We ordered the shrimp-zucchini and pork-leek. The waitstaff was not super helpful or friendly though, and we weren't wow-ed by the dumplings like we thought we'd be."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't posted a review of this place. It is hands down one of my favourite places to go out for lunch in the area. I was first introduced by some coworkers back when I worked in the area, and yesterday I had the pleasure of introducing a friend who recently started working in the area. 

The dumplings are delicious. I always get them steamed (though they are also available pan fried). Every different variation I have tried has been great. At lunch they have a special menu that includes a soup and a salad with an order of dumplings.  The lunch menu is shorter, which is great for indecisive people like me, especially when like I've already said, everything is great!  

I couldn't give this review five starts because of some service concerns. I don't expect perfection, especially not when delicious food is involved, but this left a bit to be desired. There was an awkward moment when we realized our waitress didn't speak (or understand) any French, which isn't a huge issue, it was just really awkward and unexpected to have someone staring at us clearing not understanding a word we were saying not saying anything back at us. Then there was an order mix up, when we all clearly remember the person ordering a certain item and another was delivered. We were told to just take it, because making it right would take too long. Awkward again. Finally, the pacing was a bit off, we got our soups and salads at the same time as our dumplings, when we had been waiting what felt like a long time after ordering. I wish though there were half stars, because these were minor blips on an otherwise great visit and I feel bad docking them a whole star.  Good food is worth awkwardness.

Small service issues aside, it was a delicious lunch indeed.  Delicious food at a good price.  Cosy and good for catching up with friends.  We didn't ever feel rushed."}
{"text":"Simply the best dumplings EVER! So tasty and juicy, and the fried ones are amazing. Tried the zucchini and mushroom ones, fried, and porc and coriander ones. Delish"}
{"text":"I've been here three times for the dumplings, and have never, ever, ever been anything less than completely satisfied (as well as stuffed to my ears). The ambiance is non-existent, but the staff do their job well, and the price is very right. However, based on my limited experience, you'd best steer clear of the soups. 

Come with dumpling-shaped intentions, and you will be rewarded well."}
{"text":"Our friend recommended that we come here for dumplings. We had just gotten to Montreal and we had some logistical issues getting to the restaurant (our Uber couldn't find us). By the time we got there for lunch, it was 4:00. We were ready for some food and a couple of drinks. We ordered 2 kinds of dumplings: lamb and green onion and curry beef. I wanted a cocktail, but they were out of ingredients for 2 of the drinks I tried to order. I settled on a Cosmo. It arrived in a wine glass and was overly sweet, with little alcohol. The dumplings were very good. I would definitely want to come back and try others. The service was spotty, but if you like dumplings and want to try some kinds that you haven't seen elsewhere, come to Qing Hua."}
{"text":"Thank you Qing Hua, I no longer have to go all the way to NYC for soup dumplings. For those unfamiliar, soup dumpling are made with soup directly in the dumpling. Maximum soupyness can be found in the porc variety. You'll note that the seafood and vegetable dumplings are not as soupy as the meat ones. 

When Qing Hua says that the are a dumpling house, they mean it. Don't expect to find anything else except a few appetizers on the menu. All the dumplings are fresh and hand made. I would recommend steamed over fried as the frying can dry them out and you will miss out on the flavour that comes in the soup.  

Just watch out for that first bite, they are really hot."}
{"text":"We visited here at the recommendation of a foodie friend at McGill and I'm happy we did, we would never have found it on our own. Thank goodness for Yelp or I would never have remembered what it was called - I came across it again while looking for somewhere to recommend during another visit to Montreal.

This is my favourite place I've ever been for dumplings. They are significantly different than dumplings I've tried anywhere else. They're sort of soup dumplings, but with thicker dough and less broth. I still remember them fondly even though it's been over a year since our meal. We had the beef coriander, the pork with leek and shrimp and the lamb with green onions. All three were really delicious. Two of us were able to finish the three orders but we were pretty full when they were gone. If I went back I'd either get three orders for two of us again or I would get two orders of dumplings and a soup or salad. The cucumber with pig's ear and the spicy tongue dishes both sound really interesting, plus there's wonton soup if I'm visiting with someone who is a little less adventurous. :)

Can't wait to go back. This would be a great place to go with a small group (more dishes to try!) for a visit."}
{"text":"Pork & shrimp dumplings. Very pleasant. It's super cheap and good."}
{"text":"So far, it's the best soup-dumplings in Montreal. I just keep going there, bring my kids, and take a few frozen dumpling back home as a souvenir."}
{"text":"today was my first time at Qing Hua - the first of many more to come. upon entering i noticed a number of quirky decorations and a somewhat curious split between a cafeteria style seating area and a more intimate section, but the place is small enough that i felt lucky just to get a table. my companion very cleverly called ahead to order so almost as soon as we arrived, we were greeted with their new soup (as of the start of this year). while it was only so-so (hot & sour soup consistency without hot or sour flavours; it looked rather like plum sauce with tofu but was rather tasteless), i knew there was more to come. the carrot-cabbage-vermicelli salad had a deliciously sweet dressing and was devoured in no time. it was followed by another delicious salad, and although i couldn't identify it, it was wonderful. then came the dumplings. we ordered pork & shrimp, beef & celery and curry chicken. all three were steamed and absolutely perfect. with a splash of bouillon in each, every bite was fresh, textured and simply bursting with flavour.

the entire meal came to just about $40 before tip. this included two soups, a decent sized salad, a second smaller salad, and about 30 dumplings in all. i couldn't ask for a better value or more flavour. the staff were courteous and accommodating making this my new favourite place to eat!

(sorry for raving, but it really was that good. i'm sure other reviews will be more critical.)"}
{"text":"This is a rather wired review! I have had some awesome kimchi from this place but i was not there!!
My wife had a chance to have lunch with friends here. I have to mention that i would never imagine her eating kimchi-sh food. She simply hates it! But this was so different not only did she have some but brought me some home. I had both steamed and fried ones and stuffed differently (beef, chicken, pork and shrimp)
Loved it! I must go there next time!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas eu le temps d'apprécier mes dumplings car j'étais un peu pressée. Ceux-ci était bon, et le service rapide malgré la foule mais je ne les ai pas trouvés exceptionnels. Je ne pense pas réitéré l'expérience."}
{"text":"Way overrated. The service was ok. The fried dumplings were average at best. We had the pork and shrimp, and the beef and curry. Both were fine. Can't see how this is a five star place. This was a small hole in the wall, which was fine for dumplings but better dumplings can be had.  Just because you get a ton of dumplings with your order does not mean the joint is good . . .  just saying."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place based on the reviews, but was disappointed. The dumplings are ok, but nothing special relative to what's available for much less money in the greater NYC or Washington, DC, areas. 

Two orders will easily feed three people, so bring at least four or five and vary your order so the meal isn't monotonous. Stick to the steamed dumplings.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Mon frère habite à côté alors nous les prenons souvent pour emporter. Toujours excellents et abordables. 

On a essayé les dumplings qu'ils vendent congelés. Ils sont bons, mais ne sont pas aussi bons que ceux que nous mangeons frais. Les congelés sortent également plus petits.

Ceux aux pétoncles sont excellents et essayez les frits également, ils sont succulents. 

Le service est correct. Le restaurant n'est pas très joli, mais comme la plupart des restaurants asiatiques, on y va pour la bouffe et non pour le décor ou le service."}
{"text":"Safe to say that one of the best dumpling places I have been to in Montreal. They have fried and steamed versions and you can also choose two different types of dumplings for one order. Yelpers have been raging about their dumpling soup but I didn't try that because I am not really a soup person. I had beef curry (steamed) and chicken coriander. Both were amazing and full of flavour. I was expecting something dull but the flavours blew me away. And the best part is, they were served really hot so you can truly taste the wholeness of the dish. The ambience is pretty casual but the food steals your heart, I am definitely bringing more friends to try this place out. The dumplings are also like $9.99 only but has enough dumplings to fill you for the day,"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic dumplings this is the place to go! They have all different kinds like pork, beef, shrimp, etc. You can get them steamed or fried (I prefer them steamed). The prices are decent, about $10-$12 per basket of dumplings.  
*Highly recommended*"}
{"text":"It's true that their dumplings are juicy and delicious.  We have them both steam and pan fry.  They were some of the best that we had.  We filter the restaurant based on yelp review and it said it is good for group and kids.  We have 10 people. However we were told our kids were being too loud. They were only seating at the table talking to each other.  It's obviously the lady doesn't have kids.  Service was slow too, we were seated without a menu for a while until we asked for them. And they only accept cash or debt card. Our US debt card does work here and we don't have enough Canadian.  We ended up using US $ with exchange rate of 1:1."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It looks like a little hole on the wall but this place will surprise you. The dumplings are great and at a good price. The beer choice are also pretty good. The service is lacking but the dumplings are so good I don't even care."}
{"text":"Qing Hua has the best dumplings in Montreal. 

I always order them fried instead of boiled as they are much more tasty. 

The only downside to this restaurant, which if improved could really make the experience better, is the decor. The chairs, table, large empty fish tank, poor lightning all need a serious re-think. It's almost embarrassing bringing people here for the first time. 

That being said, you'll come back time and time again for the great dumplings."}
{"text":"Stupefyingly tasty food;  bizarre decor;  hole-in-the-wall location;  disinterested, asymmetric service;  just a tick overpriced.  And a crowd of happy regulars catching up over fragrant steaming basketloads of goodness, oblivious to the glaring flaws.

Montreal's restaurant scene, writ on a soup dumpling.  (Try the pork & cabbage.)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spot in Montreal, mostly because the cabbage/dill dumplings are to die for. The other vegetarian options are good but not to that level of goodness. Have them fried as it really rounds out the flavors perfectly."}
{"text":"There is no end of compliments for this place. I go all the time and order take away even more. It blows my mind how good everything is.  For me it's beef coriander steamed and a nice cucumber salad."}
{"text":"What Qing Hua has to offer is what anyone truly needs in life (other than oxygen, of course): Scrumptious dumplings! I have visited this restaurant quite a few times, and never was I disappointed by my choice. All of their dumplings live up to the expectations: The dough is thin and cooked to perfection, the fillings tasty and well seasoned. Important detail: They are juicy as hell, which makes them explode in your mouth. Need I say more? 
Either filled with pork, beef, shrimp, chicken, or veggies, they are all, in my opinion, flawless."}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings! 15 steamed or fried dumplings for around $10. I recommend steamed because the fried ones can sometimes be overdone. 
I've tried their pork and coriander, chicken with mushroom, and pork with leek and shrimp dumplings. All were very good!
I also tried their marinated cucumber appetizer. Definitely recommend...but let it be know, it's large! Their portions are overall very large. I always end up taking home ~5-7 dumplings with me.

Service - very slow and pretty unfriendly. It takes a long time to be acknowledged by a server after you've been seated and often a long time to get your food. Don't even ask about water! I've gone over to their counters and refilled water myself with their pitchers.

That being said -- food is good enough that I go back regardless of the service. 
I'd say it's a great place to go if you're craving dumplings and are more patient than me. Also  great place to order take out from!

*Not a good place to go if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"If you like dumplings you'll love Qing Hua.  I think there were close to 30 (or more) dumpling varieties on the menu - featuring vegetarian, pork, seafood, chicken, lamb, beef and various combinations as well as various additions such as cabbage, coriander, curry, etc.  And, you can get them steamed, boiled or fried (for $1.50 more).  15 dumplings to an order for steamed or fried - you get a few more if you have them boiled.

I had the steamed pork with coriander dumplings and they were very good - extremely tender and flavorful.  And, very filling!  Total cost was just over $10 and included hot tea.

With so much variety, my only wish is that they'd offer combinations - even if they'd charge a bit more for them.  I would have loved to try a few more flavors and have a few fried dumplings.  Maybe they do offer this if you ask - but it'd be nice to mention on the menu as well."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are delicious! Finally, a restaurant on this street that is continuously pushing great food and always busy."}
{"text":"As I said in my review about the Qing Hua in Chinatown, this location is a lot better. The service was good and the food arrived at a decent rate. The entire meal for the 3 of us ended up being about 40$ which is a very fair price. We had the pork soup dumplings and the fried shrimp dumplings, which were both pretty good. In my opinion, pork is the way to go. A perfect choice for students near the area."}
{"text":"I \"lived\" in montreal for 6 months, i was on a work assignment. i spent my last dinner/night in this place. I met other people in the hotel I was staying that were also long term and they did their farewell dinners there. this should tell you everything. If that doesn't do it, then: Food is AMAZING, there was nothing I tried from the menu I didn't like, servings were big. prices are very good and the atmosphere is just great. people working there ranged from \"just\" polite and nice to interactive and funny. Definitely a 10 for this place. I only wish i could come back just to have dinner here."}
{"text":"The dumplings were adequate. They were bigger, less salty, and the ingredients tasted more authentic than places in Chinatown. Option of steamed, boiled, or fried ($1.50 extra). I the pork and shrimp leek dumplings. I'm from Heilongjiang (Northern China) and I'm used to much stronger leek in dumplings (the leek should be the dominant flavour in the dumpling). Service was good, the food arrived very fast. Mine was $9.99 + tax for 15 dumplings. Buy frozen and I think it's 30 for the same price. They take debit and issue legitimate receipts.

It might be the best of the crowd here in Montreal but truth be told I never had amazing dumplings from a restaurant so 3-star's about where it tops off for me."}
{"text":"Soup Dumpling...Xiao Long Bao....you want is steamed, fried, or boiled.  This place is on point.  12 guys, 1 girl, we split up 6 and 7 per table.  I was at the 7 table.  My order was pork with green onion and added shrimp.  Other beauties were lamb and chicken dumplngs.  A fried beef dumpling.  Each serving was approx 15 to 20 pieces.  The eyes plays tricks on you.  We did family style and traded with each other and sampled various dumplings.  The one key thing i learnt from my older sister in law in California is you need to make a good dipp8ng sauce for your dumplings.  Her wise words rang in my head and made due with what i was offered with.  A little bowl you squeeze this hoysin sauce, like 2 pea sizes, then the sambao or chili red sauce, drizzle hot oil with chili bits and douse with soy sauce.  Stir and taste your sauce.  Ask for a soup spoon to place a little of the sauce on the bottom, lightly place your dumpling, poke a hole to let the hot steam out, sip the broth coming out and let the flavours roll on your tongue.  Different nodes of ginger, garlic delishness.  You then deposit that 1 bite morsel into your mouth.  Savour the medley composed on your taste buds.  These guys did it right right.  The steamed lamb, you get that gamey nodes on your tastw buds.  The fried beef dumpling, the crispiness of the exterior.  You win...no matter what you order.  The pairing for me was beer.  Modello Especiale.  Bubbly drink washing down these pillowy goodness.  C'est magnifique!"}
{"text":"So I've heard a lot about this place from a lot of people.

The dumplings are GOOD, but the restaurant is REALLY dirty. 

Makes me uncomfortable food-safe wise as a former cook. Don't have time to mop your floors, what other shortcuts are you making, right? 

Still tasty and cheap, and if you're ok with the lack of cleanliness, then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Found this little hole in the wall because it was close to our hotel... What can I say. Easily the best dumplings we've had in North America (and we've had A LOT of dumplings in North America).

Walking into this place, shaking off the snow and ice, and partaking in homey dumpling goodness is one of our fondest memories of Montreal..."}
{"text":"I tried the steamed dumplings with pork, shrimp and mushroom. Nice taste!! Just enough soup to make it juicy, but not too difficult to handle--such as Shanghai style steaming soup dumplings. Get to try more next time!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews of this place, I was expecting to be blown away. But being of Chinese descent and having eaten excellent Chinese food in Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Taiwan, I was completely underwhelmed by Qing Hua.  

Also, I found the price a bit high for what we ordered:  1 order of pork and cabbage dumplings (tasted decent)  + 1 beef and onion dumplings (slightly funky taste to the meat) + 2 bottles of Tsingtao beer = $35 after tax. WTF?  I've had way better dumplings in other cities for half the price. 

I really, really wanna believe that Montreal has good restaurants...but sadly, I've been quite disappointed so far - especially when it comes to Chinese, Japanese and Indian food. Sigh :(

Addendum, Oct 4, 2011:  Way better dumplings are found at Mother's Dumplings in Toronto on Spadina...but the best dumplings can be found in my kitchen."}
{"text":"I don't know how they get the soup inside the dumpling pockets, but it is soooo good! We tried vegetarian and meat kinds and every single one was excellent. Definitely the best dumplings I've ever had. And I've had a lot. Made by real Chinese people. That is actually born and brought up in China.

Decor is spartan, as is usual, but hey! It's cheap and delicious; what more do you want?!"}
{"text":"Location: On Lincoln, west of Guy - it's a 5-minute walk from Concordia. The closest subway is Guy, and street parking is available [metered] but tricky to find. 

The place: Basically a dimly-lit hole in the wall, in the basement of a building. It's nothing spectacular to look at but was clean and the food was decent.

The goods: They specialize in dumplings. I went around lunch so got their special, which included Miso and a small slaw. The soup was OK, the slaw was delicious - I wish the portion was bigger! In terms of the dumplings, I think my expectations were high and this led to disappointment. Yeah, I know - everyone swears by this place but the reality is that if I were forced to pick between these guys and Mai Xiang Yuan, I'd go with Mai. Now, don't get me wrong - the dumplings were good. However, the shrimp/pork/leek that I ordered where lacking in flavour and felt a but under-steamed. They were also a little dry on the outside, despite the broth on the inside. Lastly, I prefer my dumplings to be a little smaller so that I can shove them in my mouth (yes, that's how I roll). 

Service: Good. Our waitress was friendly. 

Price point: $9.99 for 15 dumplings + soup + slaw."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because my fave dumpling place is closed for renovation. We arrived at the restaurant around 4:30pm, the place was almost empty. It was also very messy and it seemed like they didn't care about how the place looked. They gave us the menu right away but it took them a while to take our order. The service was extremely slow and the employees were playing around throwing stuff to each other that at one point they accidentally threw something to one of the customers sitting down. 

We initially wanted to order fried pork and coriander dumplings but  their frying machine was not working at the time so we ended up getting pork,shrimp and leek and pork and mushroom steamed dumplings instead. 

I was getting impatient because the food was taking so long to come, we waited at least 40 minutes... I can only imagine how the service is when it gets busy. It's not like they were understaffed. There were only 3 tables to serve. 

After a long wait , they finally brought our food. I thought the dough was too thick and heavy. I almost felt like there was more dough than the actual meat filling. The pork, shrimp and leek dumplings were alright, does not have much of a taste. The pork and mushroom dumplings were so much better. The soup inside the  pork and mushroom dumplings were also a lot tastier compared to the other one. We didn't finish all the dumplings so we had to take them home. I wanted to ask them for a small cup container for the sauce but I later saw that they actually sell it. $3 for 1 or $5 for 2. The bill also came up to $25+tip for 30 dumplings. So expensive ! 

I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"The service at Qing Hua (at least the St. Laurent location) is poor, making it difficult if you are on your lunch hour.  And the food is average at best; the miso soup was unremarkable, the hot & sour soup was mediocre, and the dumplings were not anything beyond ordinary.  There are much better choices in China Town."}
{"text":"They aren't the best spot but they're the 3rd best out of the all the reviews I've read and they do a solid job at that.They have good ingredients, the pork and cabbage is my favourite it doesn't taste cheap and taste pretty fresh. The coriander and lamb was good but since I got them steamed they weren't the best but if I would of got them fried it would of made a world of difference. 

I've ordered with them twice the first time I wasn't a fan but after the second time I realized they're in fact good. The only thing that sucks was we order 2 of everything thinking it would be 4-8 of each but really it was 15 each so we were stuck with 70 dumplings and ended up spending 60.

FYI =peanut butter ravioli are awesome the sauce, a tad of spice but nothing an amateur can't handle."}
{"text":"Amazing steamed dumplings! Tofu and vegetables, mushroom and cabbage are the best. Go with a big group - since come in plates of 15 - so you want to be ablet o tastes lots of different kinds! All made fresh, so order your next plate as soon as you get the first  because it can take a bit long."}
{"text":"As tasty as I remember from a few years ago! Delicious soup filled dumplings with very distinct flavors. Lamb and cilantro and pork and dill were memorable. We all tried some fried ones and definitely preferred the classic steamed. Pure Montreal: small,unassuming and fresh delicious food!"}
{"text":"I just picked up a couple bags of the frozen pork and green onion dumplings to replenish my dwindling supply. At about $8.95 for 30 frozen dumplings, the value is awesome--though I can imagine that at least some people don't appreciate paying twice the price when they dine-in. 

The dumplings are as juicy as the signs on the window declare and the filling is fresh, perfectly seasoned and all-around delicious. The dumpling wrappers are also tasty and do a great job of keeping the soup and filling in without being too thick or chewy. Definitely a great place to go whether you're looking to have a quick lunch or taking something home for later."}
{"text":"Not to brag but I am  one of the lucky people to really have Xiaolong Bao in Shanghi at Yu Gardens. This place does a nice job, and the choices of fillings is really fun and not an option at the famous dumpling shop. The biggest difference though is the wrapper. Here they are too dry and often have a hole in them. Never the case in Shanghi. I also miss the sauce, black vinegar with ginger and sesame oil.
  All criticism aside, I have never had any closer outside of China. It's American prices but it's in America. Shanghai's run $1 for 15."}
{"text":"This place is still amazing, but I think I may have overhyped the hot and sour soup. I think it was especially good the first time I've had it, but ever since then it's just been pretty good but nothing spectacular. The search for a perfect bowl of hot and sour soup continues...

Oh and definitely get the coleslaw. Really yummy."}
{"text":"The shop on Ave Lincoln is the smallest and least renovated of the Qing Hua \"franchise\". 
Although the interior is kind of shabby, the dumplings are great. They're not crescent-shaped like the ones most commonly found in Chinese restaurants and households, but are more round and plump. I'm guessing it helps the dumplings hold the broth inside? 
The broth is really one of the factors contributing to Qing Hua's popularity. It's full of flavor, but also burning hot, so be careful if you're \"cat-tongued\" (or nekojita, as the Japanese would say). If you don't want to risk burning your mouth, you can simply nib open the dumpling from the top and let the broth leak out.
Another secret to Qing Hua's success are the handmade dumpling wraps. They're typically fresher and better in \"mouthfeel\" than machine-made ones. 

Customer service is somewhat of a weakness at Qing Hua. Sometimes it's fast and efficient, sometimes it's slow and chaotic. I tend to avoid peak hours when possible, because the shop is inevitably understaffed. If you're still craving dumplings, try buying their frozen ones. It's very cheap and easy to prepare at home!"}
{"text":"I admit the dumplings when I first tried them were quite delicious, but service? They deserve a D. I went here a few times, and every single time I go i get below average service. The first time I went with friends, we were seated outside. They seriously forgot we were out there and took forever to come out and take our order. How can you forget a customer is seated outside? Anyways, one of the later times i went, i decided to order takeout for one order of dumplings. Took 40 MINUTES! And the resto wasn't even busy for god's sake. That's really no excuse to take 40 minutes to make 15 dumplings...The other times i went the waitresses were not so happy looking and sometimes got the order wrong, giving me someone else's dumplings. Honestly, this place doesn't do it for me. But maybe the new Chinatown Qing Hua will have better service. I'm hopeful"}
{"text":"Another Qing Hua? Really? MUST check out is what I thought. I took my boyfriend to eat there today and surprisingly the menu is not the same as the Qing Hua on Lincoln or in Chinatown. There's more bao (buns) and less of a variety in dumplings and the way its cooked (steamed./boiled/fried) I ordered the fried shrimp dumplings while my boyfriend had some kind of fried dumpling with chicken filling. 

When the food arrived, I saw a bunch of very horizontal looking dumplings. When I mean horizontal, I mean pretty horizontal. That was definitely unexpected. I expected the round, chubby or circular ish shaped dumplings. This was not the case nor did it affect the taste because WHOA they were good. At least mine were because my boyfriend kept taking my dumplings. His were....hm just ok. But boy, the shrimp ones were good. 

We also ordered the spicy tofu which was not bad either. Waitress was very attentive as well, reflling waters and asking us how we liked our food. Nice! I haven't tried their bao yet, but shrimp dumplings I recommend."}
{"text":"Worth noting that this place is actually called Sammi & Soupe Dumpling now although it is a third branch of Qing Hua. Excelllent hearty soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"These are the best dumplings I have ever had. After trying a few different I recommend the classic pork & cabbage!!!! It is a little tight inside though"}
{"text":"I love these dumplings!
These tasty dumplings are fresh as you order them and it shows!
Honestly, I can't really identify the dumping after I order them, but that's fine. The flavour is so rich and juicy that my mouth misses the subtleties.
I love going here and trying new flavour combinations. Seaweed and beef (I think)? Yes please! Just pick two flavours, ask for 15 steams dumplings, and enjoy!
The price is right and the ambiance is ok. It's a bit tough to find find though, it's unlikely you'll stumble upon this place."}
{"text":"Decent dumpling but not good enough to go through the horrible customer service again. The resturany is short staff and the waitress is not too bright. She can only look ahead but not what is around her. Literally waved and screamed for her attentiom when she brought us the wrong plate of food. The cashier lady had a angry face and was rude to customer. Why do i need to spend money for okay dumpling and bad attitude?"}
{"text":"Classic take out food for my boyfriend and I. 
I dont know about the service and all, but it always looks crowded and very busy on friday nights, thats why we prefer to eat at home (and get there fast). These dumplings are probably the best in montreal. We always order the lamb/coriander, the one with dill (and shrimp?) and porc shrimp (very classic). I'd also want to point out that you actually get big chunks of shrimp in your dumpling, and its not just a meat-like paste wrapped in wontons.
I also like my little fortune cookie that comes with it which makes it a little ritual for friday nights. :D
For the price, the taste and the amount of food you get, you should definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Not totally cooked! Worst service ever! Bad surrounding! Never try it again. This is not Chinese dumplings at all!"}
{"text":"One of many dumpling places in down town Montréal. Second time here on a busy Saturday night. We got the last table. Asian staff in a dark dim basement. Crowd probably here for the food and not the decor. Prices are affordable which explains the large student presence. The staff seemed cold and distant as in many of these restaurants. Not inviting or warm, almost annoyed of our presence. I ordered a soup with dumplings which only showed up with my main. We order one pan fried choice which only gets pan fried on one side?? A few minutes later we got the soup and steamed dumplings. The tables are small and close to each other. We got to share our condiments with our neighbors since the tables are too small. If you don't mind poor service and tight quarters, you'll enjoy the good food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Un peu surpris la première fois que j'ai mangé ici... les dumpings sont juteux et quand on les mange un peu trop chaud, c'est une surprise brûlante qui explose dans la bouche! C'est qu' il y a un peu de soupe dans chacune de ces petites bouchées et il faut une certaine pratique pour les savourer pleinement! Il faut s'y prendre lentement, faire un petite incision dans la pâte et laisser la soupe s'écouler lentement dans la bouche, prendre le temps de goûter les subtilités des saveurs!

Une fois la technique maîtrisée, on développe une dépendance rapidement à ces sublimes confections originaires du Sud de la chine. Des saveurs de toute sortes et des combinaisons inusitée, j'ai bien aimé, entre autre, ceux au porc et pétoncle.

Ici, c'est comptant seulement, mais les prix sont fort raisonnables. Un plateau fumant de 15 dumpings varie entre 10$ et 14$, ce qui est suffisant pour un appétit moyen. Je suggère au groupe de choisir des plateaux différents et de partager. Une option intéressante est de payer 1,50$ de plus pour avoir vos dumplings légèrement frits!"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh dumplings. Came for dinner, had the pork dumpling and the one with soup in it and it was good (xiao long bao) dipped in the sauce you mix and make (soya sauce, vinegar, and red spicy sauce).  The dumplings are freshly made and you can see the ladies working on them.  They seem steady and it's a good place to chill in the middle of the week."}
{"text":"Dumplings here are a more north americanized version of the \"xiao long bao\" (little steamer buns).  What do I mean by that? If you've ever had Shanghai xiao long bao dumplings, they're much smaller and way more delicately wrapped. It takes expert handling skills to lift it off the steamer, not puncture the wrapper, and dip it in minced ginger vinegar to eat it, all while using chopsticks (do use the spoon that comes with it to support the dumpling)! That being said, these ones aren't bad at all, but there wrapper it's definitely made heavy duty with less finesse but the taste is totally up to par! It's quite affordable and I usually order 1 tray of the xiao long bao and 1 tray of the fried \"jiaozi\" potstickers.  That's enough for 2 people. They have the open glass window so you can watch them wrap as you eat. Apart from my last visit where they must've been short staffed or something, they only had the steam dumplings, they're pretty consistent. Good comfort food on a cold day."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and I know dumplings of every kind. This place is a 5 star dumpling joint. It's not the classic Shanghai soup dumplings but it's excellent once you know and expect the Northern style \"soupy\" and not the sothern soupy style. Anything with pork was very good. The specialty was the Uni-pork dumpling. Never had anythin like it before. Beef was soso but my wife liked the ones with onions. I thought pork coriander was exceptional."}
{"text":"Do it. Do the dumplings. Now, not later.

Look, I'm not qualified to judge the 'authenticity' - I get that these are soup dumplings. And apparently that is something that needs a panel of critics to assess. All I know is that there were amazing meats and seasonings encased in dumpling material. Delish.

If you're not intrepid enough to chance liquid spewing all over you, I would recommend ordering the fried dumplings - they are less likely to end up on your clothes, and they are also probably closer to what you think of when you think \"dumpling\".

We got three orders of dumplings, for three people, and it was so much food, finishing up the last few became a test of courage, a challenge of endurance. What I'm saying is that these are delicious and filling.

Can't wait to go back for a very wallet-friendly lunch!

Taking a point off because the restrooms were kind of a mess, and that's one of my huge pet peeves; plus the service was, well, lack-luster: \"Hello? Helloooooooo...\" But all in all, a great time was had by all."}
{"text":"Qing Hua dumplings are the benchmark by which I judge all other dumplings (and none have come close to comparing yet).

The secret to Qing Hua dumplings is that they're filled with broth, which I imagine permeates the dumpling as they steam (steamed is the only way to go, by the way). My good friend introduced me to these little pockets of glory and since my first experience, I've been having all my important meals (and some not-so-important) here. It's the kind of thing where when someone says they've never had Qing Hua dumplings, you become jealous, because the memory of your own dumpling awakening is still so fresh and clear in your mind.

The dumplings come in order of 15. \"FIFTEEN DUMPLINGS? WHO WOULD WANT TO EAT FIFTEEN DUMPLINGS?\" you might ask. To which I respond: \"YOU DO, THAT'S WHO.\" Just trust me. I'm 5'3\" and every time my friend and I go for Qing Hua we split 45 dumplings and leave no dumpling behind. Pork and leek, beef and coriander, and chicken and mushroom are my all-time favorites. 

Come hungry and take a fortune cookie - the fortunes here are the best I've received (freakishly applicable to life at the moment).

P.S. the service is THE WORST. But once you dip those steamy hot dumplings in their chili and vinegar concoction and it touches your lips, you'll completely forget about the fact that you waited an hour for a seat, and 15 minutes for menus, and another 20 minutes to order."}
{"text":"They are very different from soup dumplings. These are dumplings with tasty fillings.  

Pretty decent dumplings that come in a variety of choices.  They even allow you to mix 2 types.  And you can choose steaming, boiled, or fried dumplings.  The selection of fillings is vast and they do them from scratch which adds to the authenticity of the place.  

Cash only so come prepared."}
{"text":"Tucked on a side street just off Rue Guy was this little delight.  From the yelp reviews I knew I had to try it on my recent trip to Montreal.  I went there with dumplings on my mind and nothing else.  Almost as soon as we sat down a pot of tea appeared.  A nice thing, espeically since the other \"dumpling\" place we went to (see my review of Mai Xiang Yuan) didn't even have it as an option!  

We got the shrimp, cabbage and egg dumplings steamed and the pork and cabbage ones pan fried.  Both were good.  But again a bit of a different style than I typically have gotten or made.  They are like wanna be soup dumplings.  But not really enough to be soup, more like a big squirt of broth.  Good, and tricky not to get on you, but not the same as soup dumplings I've had in other places.  I'm starting to think of this as the \"montreal\" style of dumplings.  The pork ones were pretty good, although they could have used another 1 minute to really give them a good texture.  The steamed ones were fine, but I really didn't get any egg in mine and the dough had a bit more \"bite\" to in than I typically expect.  Although the thickness was good.  

One cool thing is they will sell you frozen dumplings to take home.  A great idea!  Rather buy these than the machine produced ones in a bag with mystery meat.  

Prices are good, but didn't try anything else other than the dumplings.  The chili oil was very good and I highly recommended using it.  Not blazing hot, just a slight tingle to the outside of your lips but a great flavor.  My solution to the squirting dumpling syndrome?  Just pop the whole thing in your mouth and bit letting the juice flood your mouth instead of squirting out onto your shirt."}
{"text":"I am almost ashamed to say that I had to travel to Montreal (living in NYC and all...) in order to discover the magic that soup dumplings are. I ordered the shrimp and pork filled dumplings and they were so delicious - juicy, liquid filled, heavenly dumplings - I dare say, this was one of my best meals in Montreal. I must go on a quest for soup dumplings in NYC very, very soon."}
{"text":"Dumpling heaven - Go immediately and enjoy!   All of our dumplings were made to order and were amazing.  For better dumplings, you'll need to go to China. The tofu salad was good as a starter.  Prices were very reasonable.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Tasty food, juicy dumplings. Service is less than average. 

Take out frozen dumplings also cook well. (just don't thaw before cooking.)"}
{"text":"I'm leaving here stuffed and happy, but not blown away. I had the lamb and corn dumplings(very good) and the pork &shrimp which were recommended as their most popular (honestly, pretty mediocre). I would recommend coming here with a few friends, there are several kinds of dumplings to try, so it's more fun when you can order more! Get here early though, it's very small and gets full during dinner time."}
{"text":"The dumplings are tasty but I find they are too pricey.  I had better dumplings elsewhere at a more reasonable price.  I only went there once or twice when it first opened for business.  Haven't been back since then.  I feel like they are trying to rip off tourists."}
{"text":"I had dumplings for the first time here. I got the pork and green onion (fried) and they were amazing! Very inexpensive too, considering how many you get. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Meh! Sorry to disappoint but these are not Soup dumplings.. 
Besides that fact, the dumplings still are not good..

My recommendation - pass."}
{"text":"Well apparently only one of the two Qing Hua locations actually serves Xiao long bao and this is the one.. What's nice about this spot is that they have chicken XLB options... We had the chicken, pork, and pork/crab.. I was pleasantly surprised..."}
{"text":"It's my friends first time to have dumplings and he fell in love with them! The food was good and the service was great. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"I took my mother out for dumplings at Qing Hua last night and was extremely dissatisfied. My mother become quite sick, after having only a few of the Pork and Shrimp Leek dumplings. Later that night it was clear she had food poisoning. Service was atrocious. Over 20 minutes after we were seated, we had to search the restaurant for the waitress to acknowledge us. We were ignored during the entire meal. The tables weren't particularly clean, and felt sticky. Overall, I regret coming here."}
{"text":"Always satisfied the dumpling craving! The wait times are a bit long but still so yummy. Could have more sauces and combinations with ginger etc the way dumplings are traditionally eaten."}
{"text":"A HIDDEN GEM! It's away from the busy streets, so unless you are a keen observer or have a friend who is a local with great tastes in Asian cuisine, this place can easily be missed. 

Here you have the option of boiling, steaming, or frying your dumplings. Personal suggestion is that you should also have the dumplings steamed. Especially with the shape these dumplings come in, all perfectly round. Plus, they weren't kidding about \"juicy dumplings\". These dumplings are packed with juice; another reason why I recommend that they should come steamed. If you don't bite these carefully, the table can get pretty messy. But as the Chinese say, a messy table indicates a meal well eaten. I've eaten dumplings all my life, in British Columbia mainly. Yet I have to say that these dumplings are the best ones I've had in my life! 

You can dip them in vinegar, the traditional soy sauce, or oil with pepper flakes. Any of them goes well with these dumplings. Even if you mix any two of them. I tried the combination of soy sauce with the oil. Yum! 

Service was quick! There was a good deal of people not of Asian descent, which goes to show that this place is indeed popular in Montreal. As though it couldn't get any better, I ate about 20+ dumplings and paid no more than $13.86 (including 15% tip). I think they're not picky about their tips here, unlike in other Chinese establishments, because I could input my own tip percentage. Yes, they accept cards now. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Came because I saw lots of pictures on Instagram that looked good. Doesn't live up to the hype at all. Had the peanut butter dumplings and fried porc dumplings. Didn't enjoy either. I've had much better!"}
{"text":"Not the kind of place if you're expecting to have good to even normal service, it's actually very bad service to the point they ignore you and don't even bring items that you ordered as simple as a drink... But the only thing that this place has going for itself is that the dumplings are very good and that's it about this place, so if you want great food and really bad service then come here it's that simple."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place two stars instead of one, but the attitude the employees had here was just too horrible. The food was, okay. I was in Montreal for a business trip and was really craving some xiao long bao- soup dumplings so a friend recommended we try this place. It was interesting to see that their dipping sauce did not have ginger like the ones I'm use to do, but thats not something I can't live with. We ordered a set of dumplings each. To our surprise we only got one. The servers took away our sauce mid way to our meal without saying anything to us and just gave it to the table next to us (rude). We waited a few minutes after finishing our first batch and asked the waitress for the other batch. She said, oh Iet me check on that. When she comes back she said, no you only ordered one. (i forgot to mention that after my friend ordered, I asked her what she would recommend for me to order, i took her recommendation and ordered the dumpling with the leek in it) I informed her that I asked for the one she also recommended. after a \"Okay, *SIGH\" she goes to put in our order, my friend and I look at each other with a \"okaaay, that was weird\" face and say \"first the sauce, now this?\" we let it go, we get the second set of dumplings and ask for a togo box since we didn't get to finish about 5 of them. I ask for a side for the sauce as well -- which they forget and I have to ask again. 

We go to pay, which may have been the worst part of it all. 

We give her the money for our order and she pretty much throws the change at us ($5- bill- pretty much expecting us to leave the whole $5 in the tip jar since we saw it was filled with straight $5 bills) At this point, I was fed up with their attitude here and was so close to asking why they were being such A-holes to us. instead, My friend and I take out a single american dollar and put it in their tip jar- 

She forgot to give me my receipt (which I needed for my expense sheet) so I go back in, and ask for it, she reprints my receipt and hands it without a word.


YOU'RE WELCOME THAT WE DECIDED TO SPEND MONEY AT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT, you are so welcome, and thank you for the horrible experience. I will make sure to never come here again. 

Din Tai fung is so much better- wish you had one in Montreal, it would put this place out of business."}
{"text":"After trying Qing Hua on the recommendation of a friend who took me here, I can say that it is one of my now two favored dumpling places in Montréal (the other being Mai Xiang Yuan). The thing about dumpling places is that every Chinese kid growing up will always think that their parents' handmade dumplings are the best and hence cannot be beaten. In addition, when you take parents out to various dumpling restaurants, they will most likely comment about how their dumplings taste WAY better, but I have to give them my thanks for stating the obvious, I guess?

Anyway, we ordered a steamed basket of shrimp, pork, and leek dumplings (my go-to for testing the quality of the dumplings) and a plate of pan-fried curry beef dumplings. I should mention here that Qing Hua advertises their dumplings as \"soup dumplings,\" which seems to be rather misleading as it automatically makes me think of Shanghainese ???, which look more like small steamed buns and have LOTS of soup in them. Their northern-style dumplings, however, seemed to be relatively enhanced by the soup they had in them, which is normally not how they're made, but I'll take it. They were very good steamed dumplings overall! As for the curry beef dumplings, my friend and I both ended up agreeing that frying the dumplings made the filling taste a little off, and it wasn't nearly as juicy as the steamed ones and they most likely would have tasted better had they also been steamed. After finishing the plate, we ended up just ordering another round of the shrimp, pork, and leek dumplings, because why the hell not?

Overall, I still think I like Mai Xiang Yuan better than Qing Hua, but it's still definitely worth checking out especially if you want a northern-southern Chinese fusion-esque (NOT Americanized Chinese, by the way) dumpling, with the physical style of the northern one and the soupiness of the southern one. Eat up, because you're going to miss them when they're gone!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty non existent but the menu for dumpling is pretty extensive. Please be aware you will not be offered a fork but chopsticks are on the table. The dumplings were pretty good a little oily though. I could not let anyone know since we were never checked on to see if everything was up to expectations."}
{"text":"These dumplings are delicious, with a variety of interesting flavours like chicken curry, beef and coriander, and pork and mushroom. A really great place to go with several people, to try several types of dumpling."}
{"text":"Service here is terrible. We came here around 1pm and there's really not a ton of people. We were seated right away but no one took our order until 20 mins later.  We literally had to flag someone down. 

When we were ordering, we kept repeating we wanted the \"pork and corn\" and the waiter kept asking us \"what number\" and we said \"pork and corn, uh 26?\" And it turns out 26 was \"pork and leek\" and 26A is \"pork and corn\". So after repeating it two - three times, we still got the wrong order just because the wrong number was given which is super frustrating. No other numbers on here had an A or a B so I can see why my husband missed it. 

Furthermore, taste wise and texture, it's nothing compared to Mai Xiang in Chinatown and Sammy's soup dumpling. So skip this place if you're looking for a good dumpling house with decent customer service in Montreal. Disappointing."}
{"text":"i came here after searching from hotel a spot for soup.  its freezing so whats better than soup and dumplings?  the answer is simply soup dumplings.

1st star - for the variety of dumplings available.  

2nd star - i beef curry dumplings that were suggseted by the waitress. seriously...10 dumplings for $6?  thats crazy, they were so cripsy and good

3rd star - classic pork soup dumplings...you can watch the ladies in the back make them

4th star - you saw real chinese people actually eating here so you know walking in it had to be good.  and it was!!!

-1 star - because they dont take credit only debit but US debit cards dont work, i didnt have canadian dollars. but they sure did take US dollars!!"}
{"text":"Best steamed dumplings I've had in Montreal to date. The dumplings are much bigger than the ones at Mai Xiang Yuan.These steamed goodies are packed with great flavors. What makes em awesome is the broth. I have no idea how they get the broth inside the dumplings. But again, its none of my business. My job is to just finish em off. Cash only establishment.  Lots of different varieties to choose from. Also they have another location in Chinatown. I'll be back again....... SOON

Food -  Great
Service - You go here for the food, not the service
Ambiance - Casual / Clean / Crowded
Worth the money - Oui"}
{"text":"Came here mid-day for late lunch. The service was slower than the last time we came. Here is an explanation for rating:

2 out of 5:
The servers, teenagers, were the least helpful as they spent more time staring at their phones. The kitchen apparently was behind in making dumplings for different tables. Apparently, there was some error in the orders and they had to remake some. We waited 40-minutes before the servers told us this info. 

5 out of 5:
The dumplings are well worth the wait for them to make these excellent soup dumplings by hand, but the service is horrible. We enjoyed the beef curry dumplings and the shrimp, leek, and egg dumplings. So wonderful and fresh. 

FYI- they only take cash or debit card. This is an inconvenience for travelers who prefer not to take $ out at local ATMs due to fees. 

We enjoy the choices here and would come again but perhaps check the other Qing Hua restaurants to see if there is better service."}
{"text":"Yum! What else can I say about this cute little dumpling joint! As good as Grandma's, which is saying quite a lot!

Their pork/cabbage soup dumplings are amazing and I would suggest to be everyone's first dish to try out (unless you keep Kosher or Halal - in that case, this restaurant is NOT for you).

All of the dishes are very well priced and everything is freshly made to order. Try it out next time you're looking for something interesting to try out! 

BTW - They only accept cash, they do have an ATM that will rape your wallet for their additional charges. They also have high chairs for families!"}
{"text":"This place serves delicious dumplings for a really good price! Most of their menu is around 10$ and you get 15 steamed or fried dumplings with it.

I got pork&coriander and pork&cabbage dumplings for mix and match; both were very good. Their meat dumplings have soups in them so it's really juicy but the veggie dumplings don't. One thing I didn't love about them was the thick skin/wrap. 15 dumplings were already filling and the thick wrap got a little too much by the end. 

If you're looking for a nice sit down dinner and fancy ambience, this is not for you. The place is dimly lit and the crowd is mainly families with young kids of locals. But for casual dinner filled with good dumplings, this is perfect."}
{"text":"The steamed dumplings were delicious! We had a mix of pork&shrimp and beef with coriander. I'm removing a star because my hot and sour soup was pretty cold. The service was a little slow as well. However, still won't stop me from coming back. Loved the dumplings and would like to try the other kinds!"}
{"text":"Growing up in a Chinese-American household means that dumplings are serious business. It is rare that my family and I would go to an outside source for dumplings. Nevertheless I am glad we decided to come here on our trip to Montreal, and I can imagine we'd return if we lived in the area.

I liked the quiet location, separated just a bit from the busiest streets. The dumplings were tasty and plentiful and steamed properly. A bit of red bean ice cream wrapped the meal up nicely. Dumplings are great, and Qing Hua is a good place to eat them."}
{"text":"The dumplings are delicious, full stop. I have read other reviews that complain about service...get real people. This is a small Chinese restaurant, it is not the Ritz. Sit down, order dumplings, eat, enjoy and move on."}
{"text":"They have a few small bites but its all about the dumplings.  With so many different fillings.  Always get the pan fried if you can.  Warning - its 15 dumplings per order so come hungry."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by the good quality dumplings you can buy at Chinese grocery store, ormaybe it's because I've had better dumpling for less in Chinatown and regular chinese restaurents, and most definitely because I've read all the raving reviews on yelp before trying out this place, but but Quing Hua was rather a let down for me.

Choice: 

Many choices of dumpings, I have only try the old classic of dumplings, porc and chives.

Quality: 

The dough is not particularly chewy or delicately textured, it is more akin to the factory-made/bought-at-minimal-price-at-your-local-grocery than hand-made. They probably did not made it themselves. 
 
The porc and chive filling itself is rather bland, all I could taste is porc, which suggest that A) not enough chive and other spices and B) chives is really not fresh. The portion of filling is not generous either.

Portion:

The overall portion isn't great compare to other cheap eat in the area, especially for its price.

Service:

Poor

When I went there, it was 3:30pm on a week day and I was the only customer, nonetheless it took a good 20 minutes for my food to arrive, and the waitress was exceedingly busy chatting with her colleagues in the kitchen to bother with basic waitressing. 

Price:

About 15 small-medium size dumplings for 10+ bucks is a tad bit pricey for it's cheap-eat quality and service.

Overall: 

There are just so many more restaurants in the Concordia area with higher (quality+service)/price quotient than Qing Hua..."}
{"text":"I am sitting in my office having a plate of Pork and Coriander and Pork with Leek and Shrimp dumplings that were left over from last night's dinner. How wonderful.

There are many dumpling places in the Guy-Concordia area, some of them much more popular than Qing Hua, but nothing comes close to this little gem of Lincoln Ave. I don't remember quite how we discovered it; it was one of those nights where you embrace the whimsical beauty of life and go somewhere new. We got there in the heat of a summer munchies, and were totally undeserving of the noble treatment we got. The soup was delicious, with a flavorful miso and thinly cut, crisp green onions.  
And then came the dumplings. Never in my life had I experienced such juicy dumplings.  From the vast appealing options on the menu, my favorites are the Beef and Coriander and the Pork with Leek and Shrimp. I would have never thought of eating pork with shrimp before (not a surf'n'turf gal), but somehow these dumplings bring it all together extremely well. They have a beautiful combination of spices that  gives it a sweet, smooth taste; when you dip them in soy sauce or Qing Hua's  crushed red pepper sauce, you find a perfect complement to that lovely fresh taste. 

Definitely my favorite of its kind."}
{"text":"had some nice steamed leek and pork dumplings. The service was prompt and the dumplings were served 15 minutes after ordering. Impressive time since all their dumpling are made J-I-T. I took one star off for the lacklustre chilli oil. The place feels a bit dark and needs more lighting."}
{"text":"I will preface with the fact that I am well travelled and have eaten at little food stands in Egypt and Greece and I'm not inane but I'm sad to say that after 4 times of eating here I will NEVER RETURN. We were disgusted with the service and LACK OF HEALTH CODE CONDUCT, the server gave our plate to another table where someone picked up a dumpling to eat and then the server ran back and grabbed the plate from the table, walked to the kitchen window to pretend like he was getting another plate then plopped the same (now touched by some stranger) plate on our table, when we asked him why he have us that plate he said that the other people didn't eat any, they only briefly touched them, we politely asked for a new plate and he offered us a different flavour, we insisted that we wanted the same flavour as before but fresh ones that haven't been touched by strangers, he lied and said that it would take longer to make them again, came back 10 minutes later with THE SAME DIRTY PLATE of dumplings, only now they were burnt and OBVIOUSLY REFRIED, to PRETEND like they were fresh ones, we were infuriated and asked to speak to the manager, after 10 minutes of patiently waiting, we went to the front and demanded to speak with the manager and my boyfriend found him crouching down HIDING behind the cash counter (WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!) and he had nothing to say for himself except that we are free to order something different. We will never go back! They probably drop them on the floor in the kitchen and disregard all health codes, I think that I will be reporting them to the health inspector as well. What's even worse than the fact that they have us someone else's \"used food\" is the extent to which they tried to lie on top of lies and prance around pretending like they were getting fresh food. Absolutely appalling. SHAME ON QING HUA!"}
{"text":"I've been here to many times to count and it never disappoints. Soup dumplings have a special place in my stomach and every so often I get that craving for a cheap, delicious, and filling meal ! 

Full disclosure for anyone that goes for the first time or for people that have said terrible things about this place,Qing Hua isn't a fancy French restaurant. It is in a basement after all... A pretty dingy one at that ! But who cares ! They do one thing and they do it great, Dumplings! 

Yes this place is far from perfect, the cups are plastic, the service is subpar at best and it takes forever to get your food but yet it is always packed and keeps getting busier and busier, which is probably a blessing and a curse at the same time. Successfully maintaining the high quality and freshness of your dumplings while also meeting s higher demand isn't easy and is probably the main reason for the slow service. But if that is you biggest complain with Qing Hua, get better company, time goes a lot faster when you are having a conversation. 

This has become more of a defensive rebuttal rather than a review but if that shows anything, it is that I really love this place and consider it a Montreal institution and I was tired of seeing people give it terrible reviews for dumb reasons. 

If you go to Qing Hua come when you aren't in a hurry, with friends that you like talking to, and with an appetite. I promise you will love it !"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Qing Hua for a few years but I'm glad to see it's still as popular as ever. This was THE place where I first discovered my love for dumplings. We came on a Tuesday evening, around 8:00pm, and had to wait to get seats! I couldn't believe how busy they were.

The menu is dumplings, dumplings and more dumplings. Although there is a lunch menu available Monday to Friday (11:00am - 3:00pm).

The inside looks exactly the same. I like how you can peer through the kitchen window and see all the dumplings being made in house. They're lightning fast! We ordered and had our three dishes in no time. We may have gone overboard but hey, leftovers are never bad.

- Shrimps with pork and leek (#21) ($9.99) - we got one order boiled and the other steamed. Each order gets you 15 dumplings and the filling is nicely stuffed. Don't forget these dumplings have soup inside so be careful with your bites.

- Pork and dill (#31) ($8.99) - first time trying out dill in dumplings. Loved it! Not overpowering but the perfect balance. These were my favourite of the night. I need more dill in my life.

- Mix flavour dumpling soup (#3) ($7.99) - I also wanted to try their dumpling soup out which was totally unnecessary for two people (10 dumplings included) but it was way better than expected. They throw in an assortment of dumplings, I'm assuming extras/reject ones but I liked it. The broth was surprisingly light and flavourful.

40 dumplings later (well, with a few for home), we left very satisfied. Qing Hua is the OG when it comes to dumplings in town and I'm happy to report it's still as good as ever."}
{"text":"I love dumplings since I last had some which was in January. This one served its purposes. Over 30 toppings to choose from where you are bound To find something you like. The price is really reasonable too with the amount of food you get. 

 I had 15 beef and curry dumplings. It was not bad to eat but not something I want to eat in the future. The curry and beef mix with soja sauce dont go well together. 

However, the second dumplings were chicken and mushrooms. I heard from my friend, the mushrooms werent there. 

Overall, this place served homemade dumplings. I would give this 3 stars for a first time. The customer service could use a little more work since we had To call a waitress To be served. I believe this place could be pretty good."}
{"text":"I went here twice on my last trip to MTL, mainly because of the convenience  as it was located near where I was staying. I have to say, the prices are pretty darn good. For about 9-11$ you can get a huge steaming tray of soup dumplings and choose from like 30+ fillings. They have vegetarian, beef, lamb, pork, seafood, chicken and mixed. The first time I ate here was for lunch, and it was about $25 for 2 of use plus we got miso soup with lunch special and a jellyfish salad. The salad was ok, it was mostly cucumber, but the sesame dressing was very good.

Your dumplings are made to order and you can even watch them make them if you are sitting next to the window. 

Cash only as of May 9, 2014 kinda annoying but its worth it."}
{"text":"Great dumplings- large number of options including vegetarian! Very cheap, large portions and quick service. I had the steamed dumplings but pan fried option is available as well."}
{"text":"First stop n MTL and dumplings are on the menu... Tried the pork and coriander steamed, beef and celery fried and the pork and cabbage boiled... The fried and boiled ones were good but the standout out was he coriander  pork!!!  Great value for $30 came out stuffed (2ppl) with enough in a doggy bag for another meal for for 2! Get here fast before the hipsters take it over! Noon on a Saturday and there was an abundance of \"ironic\" facial hair and quirky tshirts...."}
{"text":"I went there multiple times and have to say that despite the quite good dumplings, all the downsides are not worth it. 
- Most horrible service I've ever had. Unable to be served in French nor English. I once even had a server stop in the middle of opening my bottle of wine just so she could answer a text. I told a server once that my bottle of red wine felt as if it had jut gotten out of the fridg, which it had, and was told that it's better this way - it is not. 
- Dirtiest kitchen I've ever seen, and it's the first thing you see when you get in the restaurant. 
- The whole restaurant itself is falling appart; floor, walls, ceiling, tables, chair, front desk. 
- The tables and chair are so sticky. 
-They have a huge variety of vegetarian dumplings they are always out of. 
-The servers get yelled at by their boss in the middle of the restaurant which is both very uncomfortable for the customers and simply unacceptable. 

They do make dumplings to take home (they are frozen) that I have yet to try. I will give this restaurant one last change by trying those - maybe I'll get the one positive thing they do, which is the dumplings, while being able to leave out all the negative ones by eating at home.

Tip: First thing you should do when being seated down is ask them what they are out of that day, it'll avoid wasting time and you'll be less frustrated in the end."}
{"text":"I mean honestly! A place just for dumplings?! I can get use to this! As a newcomer to Montreal from Florida, I've only heard of such a place and never really got the chance to dine at one...until now. Big juicy dumplings for about $9-12...it can't be beat. I went with my brother, he has their pork and mushroom dumplings(fried) and I had their beautifully steamed pork and pickled cabbage option. Very quick service, they do have different options on their menu as well in terms of the filling in their dumplings. You are guaranteed to walk out of there full and satisfied. I'm so happy that I got a chance to try this place because it just got added to my favorites. If your looking for low key date night, or just something different, I would highly recommend it, close to Concordia University and right next to the metro stop. Go and grab a bite, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Définitivement le roi des dumpings!

Excellent choix de raviolis chinois, farcis à la viande, aux fruits de mer ou aux légumes et tofu, donc de tout pour tous les goûts. Ma préférence va à ceux à l'agneau et coriandre. De tendres petites bouchées cuites à la vapeur avec un liquide que l'on boit comme une soupe, miam! 

Ce restaurant est très populaire, donc attendez-vous à faire la file, surtout les soirs de fin de semaine. Fait intéressant, on peut acheter les dumpling surgelés et les faire cuire à la maison. Sûrement meilleurs que ceux fabriqués de façon industrielle!"}
{"text":"Very good steamed dumplings. Definitely try shrimp and pork. There are days where it gets pretty packed so get there early (especially on weekends)! The location's quite small so there isnt a ton of tables available"}
{"text":"They served us raw dumplings. Yuck! When they're cooked they're yummy, though. There are several beers on the menu, all of which suck almost as much as raw pork. The beer terms glossary on the menu won't make Budweiser taste any fancier."}
{"text":"This place is a total hole in the wall, but the food is cheap and . Steamed dumplings are delicious... I also love the spicy tofu, I'd recommend it !!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall, hidden in the basement of a building with a door that you almost miss. 
The service is slow and not very friendly (but also not overtly rude). The restaurant is not well appointed and the bathroom leaves something to be desired in terms of cleanliness.
However, the dumplings are tremendous! We ordered some soup and 2 orders of dumplings for 3 people and we left very happy! Dumplings ate definitely the main attraction here, there are very few other things on the menu but the variety of dumpling filling options is tremendous! Everyone can find something worth trying here (as long as dumplings is what you are craving)."}
{"text":"So, this place may be a little hole in the wall that a typical person would pass by on a normal day. Don't do it though. This is a wonderful place for some great dumplings. They have a whole list of several meat and vegetable dumplings at a great price. The atmosphere is cafeteria style. I would recommend that anyone who likes dumplings and happens to be in Montreal should stop by for a huge plate of dumplings."}
{"text":"i spent the dreary day walking through the notre dame cemetery while listening to gregorian chant music on my ipod.  my first attempt at taking the bus towards the guy-concordia metro station was not successful.  (my card malfunctioned.)  i'd read somewhere--maybe yelp--about the beef coriander dumplings at qing hua.  i walked in and they sat me right in the middle of the virtually empty place.  i should have asked if i could move anywhere else, but my confidence was shattered since missing the opportunity to dance with a catholic-looking girl at the club the night before.

i couldn't find the beef coriander on a quick glance at the menu, so i asked the waitress.  every time i said, \"...beef coriander\" she replied with \"yes, we have beef coriander.\"  eventually i just ok and handed her the menu.  i also got a coke.  coke goes well with some foods.  empanadas, for example, and most chinese food.

i've had the soup dumplings many times at joe's shanghai in new york city, so i know how to eat them.  but these weren't shanghainese soup dumplings.  they're a creation from another part of china.  i forget if i read that in yelp or wikipedia.  although very delicious, i had a hard time eating them.  it was almost impossible.  i'm starting to wonder if you should use chopsticks at all.  it was more like fishing rather than eating.  they're smaller than shanghainese soup dumplings.  so maybe you're just supposed to grab them with your hands.

fishing can be a zen-like experience.  it was like this at qing hua.  there was a struggle with the dumplings, but once i grabbed onto one it was a most joyous occasion.  i would give this place 5 stars based solely on the dumplings.  but my time there was awkward.  sitting in the middle made me feel like an easy target for ridicule as people walked in.

remember, take a small bite of the dumpling and suck the soup in.  remember that, and you will be happy with your dumpling."}
{"text":"I had heard the most wonderful things about Qing Hua, online and offline but my visit left me incredibly disappointed. 

We entered into the restaurant and were seated right by the door which was unpleasant because of the cold winter draft we were hit with every few minutes. We looked around and there was a table at the back that we took the liberty of moving to; alas we weren't seated there initially!

I started off with a hot & sour soup which tasted okay but was the strangest shade of light grey; not the usual colour one expects! We all ordered fried dumplings - I ordered the tofu vegetable kind. It took absolute ages for our food to arrive which was really unexpected. Alas, it was not worth the wait. The filling of my dumplings were too salty and the skins were dry. My friend's dumplings were served in a plate that was pooling with water; which filled their dumplings making them soggy. 

It was all so inconsistent with mediocre service, a long wait and food that was sloppy. Perhaps we went at a bad time but I was left with a bad impression that doesn't entice me to return. 

The only thing worth noting is that they had 4 types of veggie dumplings on the menu which is a greater variety than normal."}
{"text":"Pretty good shrimp,egg,leek dumpling! Mai xiang yuan is more juicy and better though!!"}
{"text":"Being a Beijingnese, I love dumplings! My dad makes amazing ones and since I moved out I always been craving for good ones.

This was one of the recommended places by the conference I was attending in Montreal. We ordered both the beef and pork steamed dumplings (with scallion). It was nicely flavored, lots of meat (bit overstuffed compare to the authentic dumplings) packed inside of the dumpling, light and satisfying, although lacks the juiciness and many types of ingredients that usually goes with dumplings. But still, I'm quite satisfied I can find this kind of quality in north america. It's a very popular place, the wait is about 20 minutes for the food. Cash only."}
{"text":"Quite literally the best dumplings I've ever had. Menu selection is pretty minimal otherwise, but to be frank if you're looking for anything other than dumplings you are decidedly in the wrong location. Service is pretty slow, but the quality largely makes u for it. Apparently they also sell dumplings (and the apparatus to steam them) so that on your way out you can grab a large quantity to cook chez toi, as well."}
{"text":"Dumplings were ok. Restaurant is a hole in the wall. Clerk wouldn't accept visa and never came back to refresh our drinks. Wouldn't go back on my own, might go back if friends were going."}
{"text":"Address listed is wrong!  The sign outside says \"chinese ravioli\" - so we thought, ok something new.  Turns out they were dumplings.  VERY INTERESTInG!!! 

Very busy here... with people ordering the different types of dumplings.  It's really good.. comes with a sauce, which was delicioius!
There were soup-filled dumplings, as well. 

They were so good, we ordered more to go, to eat on the road.  Boy, did that hit the spot when we were out on the road, driving.. and got hungry."}
{"text":"These are the best dumplings in The city . its super fresh and beyond tasty the pork abd corriander and shrimp and anything and amazing but they make a curry beef that osind blowing . 5 stars for sure if I could give them 6 I would 
 Also great drink menu and tasty sake"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite standby's, when ever I want a quick tasty dinner after work this is usually where I end-up.

The dumplings here are second to none and the variety is awesome, This is a great place to with friends, if everyone gets a different type of dumplings and share it makes for a great meal.

I have to admit that the wait staff isn't always the most happy go lucky people but they always get to taking my order quickly. I think the restaurant is family run and the daughters are the waitresses while mom and dad are in the kitchen and I think this adds to the quirky feel of the place.

Speaking of quirky the look and feel of this place is kind of weird it looks like the space had been rented to a wanna be brew pub that failed and as soon as it closed this family moved in and  started making dumplings. It's an odd looking place.

All this being said the dumplings here are some of the best in the city and that makes up for the odd decor and interesting service. Keep in mind that your getting a meal for under $20 (for the most part) so you get what you pay for, in this case your money is going to the food."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to enjoy steamed dumplings with friends!

Whenever I bring someone new here they ALWAYS want to come back!"}
{"text":"The service is a little slow, and the dumplings are messy to eat - the steamer they're served in drips right onto the table, so you're left with a puddle of soup and condensation at the end. 

I'm also not super impressed with the flavours. They're all quite bland and often difficult to distinguish other than the herb options, like coriander and dill - but the curry chicken, which I had most recently, barely tasted of anything at all. I also had several chunks of unchewable gristle in my last batch. 

In short, I've had better quality, more varied, and tastier soup dumplings elsewhere - try Sammi's or The Dumpling House."}
{"text":"Dumplings are in the menu and they are tasty and fresh. Will run about $10 per portion. 2 portions were a bit too much for the both of us."}
{"text":"The dumplings are awesome and the noodle salad is incredible. However make sure you have cash if you do not have a Canadian debit card. They do not accept US debit cards which is absurd in 2015. Their service is not great. The waitresses seem to have a superior attitude but one can get over that when the food is so great."}
{"text":"Very glad we went. Both miso and hot and sour soups were great. Dumplings were fine. Not bad but won't be dreaming about them. Good value and fun experience so I would recommend."}
{"text":"I loved this place. They specialize in dumplings. They make them so well. My buddy said this is what they are known for. The menu boasted so many options to choose from. We got some fried and some steamed. Portions were right too.

We had the pork dumplings with cabbage and these were so cooked perfectly and each bite had flavor. Fried and steamed to perfection. Some of the best that I've ever had. 

The other scrumptious one was the chicken and green onion dumplings. Bite after juicy bite; I had a piece of heaven.

Great job!!"}
{"text":"Elle is right, juiciest dumplings I have ever devoured in my life!  This basement restaurant is located where you will most likely never find it unless you are specifically searching for it.  

For the most part, they serve dumplings as their specialty.  I would say they have about 6 or 7 tables that are nice and clean.  The dumplings are made right there on-site and each order you get about 15 dumplings that you can have either fried like potstickers or steamed!  

I ordered the pork tongue appetizer and also an order of pork, shrimp and leek dumplings.  The pork tongue app is a cold mix of sliced cucumbers, cooked pork tongue slices that temporarily holds you while they cook your dumplings (takes about 10 mins).    The complimentary soup and salad: miso soup (not very impressive and bland) and the slightly sweet cole slaw (not bad!).  With the main dish out, we dug right in.  The dumpling skin is much thicker than a regular dumpling that helps it seal in the filling and juices inside but not too thick to taste too doughy either.  As a test, I used my chopsticks to place and poke a hole on the side of one to see.  Sure enough, about a tablespoon of HOT juicy broth is packed in each one and if you aren't careful, you can burn your tongue or splatter on yourself.  I personally make a small dish of soy sauce with the hot chili oil as a dip to help flavor the dumpling as well as cool it off while I carefully biting into each one.  Be sure to bring cash and if you forget, they conveniently have a lighted ATM machine at the door entrance.  Enjoyable experience.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Yummeh! The other reviews do this place justice - it's a delicious hole-in-the-wall dumpling joint. I ordered the scallop and pork dumplings, a miso soup, and an asahi to go. Soooo delicious and hit the spot. If only I lived here - I'd go back!

Also - today was the day they started accepting credit cards. For all you foreigners out there wont to leave the cash at home."}
{"text":"I was looking for some competition for my current favorite dumpling place, and unfortunately, Qing Hua didn't even come close! I guess I should've tried what everyone else ordered. 

We had the beef and onion fried dumplings and pork and green onion steamed dumplings. Other than the onions and green onions, they were totally flavorless. I'm not a huge fan of the sauces, so I'm looking for dumplings that can stand up on their own. We liked the fried dumplings much better than the steamed, which tasted a tiny bit funky.

Otherwise, the chairs were insanely loud and screechy--they need some feet!

Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Very , very good. Great atmosphere don't let the front entrance fool you. Dumplings are great steamed, highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like them! Cheap and kind of healthy!
Only once when i ordered and picked it up, I found the dumplings not cooked and was more like dough. 
I am a vegetarian, they used to have a lot of vegetarian options before. Now whenever I ask them for tofu dumplings, I get an answer as NO mostly"}
{"text":"I am just another person confirming what was already said... I must secretly admit that I am relieved our service issues didn't just happen to me because I'm American and needed to get with the program....

We walked in and there were people at two tables and one patron standing at the counter by the cash register.  The rest was empty. We weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After standing there for a while, we sat down.  We were sitting a while when I approached the waitress and asked quietly, \"are we supposed to order at register first?\" She snapped, \"I am the only waitress for the whole restaurant. Could you give me a minute?\" So I figured out that meant that it is indeed waitress service...

When she finally got to the table, the service was fine. They were out of all varieties with courgette (zucchini).  I didn't comment but think it is a little strange because summer is in season... Nonetheless, the food we were able to get was delicious! 

My boys ate 2 baskets (15 pieces each!) of the tofu veg dumplings...

Cash only but they have an ATM inside.."}
{"text":"I was craving hot and sour soup and their hot and sour soup was good soup, just not hot (in spicy terms) and sour. That's not what theyre known for anyway. Got the very basic Shrimp + Pork + Leek Dumplings, I might have expected too much because this was a very basic type of dumpling but it was very plain. They serve half sizes (8 instead of 16), which I think is accommodating. Single waitress/server for all tables around 3 PM, but time efficient for just one person.

To put it briefly, they have dumplings but I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"The restaurant calls itself Qing Hua: Juicy Dumplings, and they don't lie. Just about the juiciest dumplings you'll ever eat in your life are here in this unsuspecting quiet little street of Montreal. 

They serve the crescent style dumplings, rather than the more familiar pot stickers. I ordered the steamed pork, leek, and shrimp dumplings. The filling is sooooo juicy and tender. I think these are possibly the best dumplings that I've had in a while. The skin is really thin and tender. I think to have these dumplings fried would be a travesty because you wouldn't get the subtle tenderness of the filling or the skin as much. 

I'm waffling a bit on giving this place 4 or 5 stars. Dumplings are definitely worth of 5 * consideration. The hot and sour soup that everyone raved about was okay. Didn't think it was anything special. The restaurant is a little confused about what it is. One half is cheap tacky Chinese and the other half is actually pretty nice EXCEPT it has this weird strip of linoleum tiles that continued from the cheap tacky side. I don't know. Maybe that's how the two halves of the restaurant are connected? 

Regardless, if you're in Montreal, you should have the dumplings here. An order of 15 dumplings are about $10 (price varies by filling type). ***Cash only***"}
{"text":"This is by far, THE best dumpling joint in Montreal.

I'm a huge fan of Anthony Bourdain's various foodie shows and always on the lookout to either try new things or learn more about ethnic foods. When he did an episode on Shanghai a few years ago, he visited a dumpling palace, how these delicious tid-bits are more than just a dim-sum staple. They have a history in China stretching back centuries, how \"soup dumplings\" the ones literally which have a soup inside are magically made and perfectly held together in their doughy exterior.

I only found out about this place a few days ago and after checking out the latest Peru exhibit at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, both of us were feeling peckish. Came here to check it out and so glad that we did. We only ordered the old stand-bys, pork and shrimp and lamb with green onions steamed dumplings and they were superb. I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu. Another good sign, when we walked in at 5:30pm, the place was empty. An hour later, practically all the tables were taken up.

Seriously, come here now before the hype sets in and you won't be able to get a table!"}
{"text":"Great dumplings! The portion is pretty great, 1 dish has 15 dumplings and it's pretty much enough for one person. We came here for lunch, and were so amazed by the quality of the food. The dumplings are juicy (the broth) and fresh. This place only accepts cash though. The service is pretty fast and people are nice."}
{"text":"I love this place. I absolutely LOVE this place. Their dumplings are phenomenal and that spicy soy sauce they've got going on is just something else. 
The ONLY reason I give it four stars instead of five is the staff. They seem slightly careless, like they would rather be anywhere but here. And it's annoying that the friendliness of the staff is what is letting down the quality of this restaurant! 

I always get take out so it doesn't bother me as much as it would if I would have a sit-down dinner, but the fact that I actually avoid coming to dine here and prefer minimal contact should be a red flag."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for dumplings in Montrel.  Had pork and lamb dumplings that were pretty tasty and standard fare."}
{"text":"Amazing !!!! The curried chicken dumplings rocked!!!!

A definite place to go if you love dumplings/ pot stickers!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and come with my boyfriend for a take out every weekend. However, after our last visit we doubt we want to go back. 
The waiting time was getting longer and longer at each time of our visit. They always tell you your order will be ready in 15 mins, which was true at the beginning, but last time I waited almost 40 mins at the place for my take out. In addition, they made a mistake with our order. My boyfriend ordered on the phone for one order of pork leek dumplings for him (he is allergic to shrimp) and one order of pork, shrimp and leek for me. He repeated the order over the phone three times and he even mentioned he was allergic. They ended up giving us the two orders of pork, leek and SHRIMP! and we didn't notice until my boyfriend was having trouble breathing. I have a very bad aftertaste after that night."}
{"text":"Worst dumpling I have ever eaten in North America...Dumplings, not recommended at all. The wonton is okay though, but it is small portion with four to five small wintons."}
{"text":"Tucked away on a quiet street of St Marc, there's Qing Hua, a dumpling shop where you would least expect. Its wooden sign with huge Chinese characters adorned the tiny entrance that leads to a space of not more than 5 tables. What the hell do they actually sell?

Well, once you walked in, when you look through the glass window, there's usually several Chinese ladies, carefully making the dumplings from scratch with their hands. I thought it was fascinating. Not because they make dumplings from scratch. Gosh, I made them myself too. But it's just I don't expect to see this in the middle of no where in Montreal.

The waiter finally came up to us and gave us their menu. They have a wide selections of dumplings with an option to have them steamed or with soup. Fried? Don't even think about it. With dumplings this fresh, you would be a fool to deep fry them. There are also some very exotic items that you can order if you know Chinese.

I ordered the pork with cilantro dumpling and it was ready after 15 minutes wait. It was mild and tasty and you can taste the nice texture of the homemade dumpling skin. With a little soy sauce, it's, should I say, heavenly.

Expect nothing but dumplings here. Go get your fried rice somewhere else. But if you are seriously into authentic homemade dumplings, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Delicious soup dumplings! The place was packed but the wait wasn't long. The kitchen is visible from the dining area, which gives it an extra level of reliability as it looks super clean and sterile. Overall a great experience during my visit to montreal."}
{"text":"The only place I have been to that is dedicated solely to dumplings. The dumplings here great. However, I have to be honest. As good as they are they didn't wow me. It was great but it was just 1 star short of wow. There was no wow factor in the food and the service leaves a lot to be desired. The restaurant was pretty full but only 2 servers?"}
{"text":"First time I tried this dumpling thing.
We were eating beef and onion, chicken curry, shrimps and pork with coriander.
The food was great, the service should be better and the place really need some renovation.
They have imported beers.
Prices nice.
Cash and debit.
After all 3* from me."}
{"text":"I have had enough of there service. We went there around 9:30 for a late dinner after visiting a freind in the hospital. I have been here twice already and both times remarked about the crappy service esp. the that chubby short haired chinese girl. But this time they lost me as a customer who entertains alot. She was so rude about letting us to sit down and eat as it was close to closing time but then turns around and says to us do you want take out!!!! Like WTF lady.....we were 5 people. She needs to learn how to talk to people. 3 times is enough of her fucken crap. Guess she is on her period none stop or she needs to get laid...one of the 2.
Instead we went down the raod at Al-Baghdadi patisserie, wow that was good...yes their food is good here but they are not the only ones.
Anyone going here and this girl is rude like I have seen her do with otheres as well just tell to go get laid and walk out!!!"}
{"text":"Walking into Qing Hua, straight ahead of you as you go down the front landing, there's a big sign above the service station that explains, on faux scroll-like paper, the history and tradition of dumplings.

I wish I'd read that sign the first time I ate here. Then I'd have known that boiling broth erupting from bitten dumplings is a total normal thing. And that you aren't really supposed take bites of dumplings. If anything I've become a gracious dumpling eater over time.

Dumplings are trendy in Montreal recently, despite having been around probably forever. I know this because out of nowhere during summer '15 every \"Where are we going to eat?\" discussion was settled by \"Let's get dumplings!\". Soon I was the one telling anyone who'd risk eating with me that probably we should have dumplings. Unless we'd already eaten dumplings say...two days in a row. 3 would be overdoing it. So you can't go wrong in early 2016 suggesting dumplings if you're responsible for lunch decisions at your office.

Oh yeah.. Qing Hua. It's hard to identify what's unique or different about this place compared the the multiple other dumpling spots in the area: The selection and flavours are the same everywhere. Menu prices are identical or within a dollar of each other. Every decor is the same shoddy thrown together pastiche of kitsch Asian emblems I suspect the owners would prefer not having at all but do it out of some expected obligation. The service in all these places is unpredictable and a toss up on any given day.

There's a chance dumplings in the 514 are a big cartel. A big yummy cartel.

I forgot to talk about Qing Hua again and we're many many words into this and you want to know whether to go or not. I can say that Qing Ha is named most frequently in those aforementioned lunch discussions, and it's packed and busy at most times, which I can't say for the other spots I've tried. Take that as you will. There's is however a  chaotic feel particular to Qing Ha that I suspect is due to inefficiencies or overwhelmingness. On this last visit our super nice waiter came and introduced himself twice, like he'd forgotten we'd been there over 20 minutes. I empathize. 

...eating suggestions! Share different flavours, mix fried and steamed dumplings, vegetable and meat varieties. Otherwise it gets bland to work through, i.e., it's hard to tell any of the meat varieties apart, and 15 steamed dumplings in a row gets pasty in the mouth quickly. 

And don't bite into the dumpling."}
{"text":"Les dumplings agneau coriandre sont délicieux , on en oublie le service très moyen. Les prix sont bas et on en ressort rassasiée. Je préfère ce restaurant là à son homologue du quartier chinois."}
{"text":"We headed to the new location of Qing Hua thinking that it replaced the restaurant on Lincoln. FALSE. The original location is still opened. To our surprise, the new Qing Hua on Ste-Catherine has a different menu: It mostly only serves soup dumplings (xiao long bao).

The dumplings are handmade and have a delicious filling and a tasty piping hot broth inside that will either: 
- Cause a 2nd degree burn in your mouth. Pain is pleasure, right?
- Or worse, spill out if you are not careful. Be gentle when you pick up the dumplings with your chopsticks and use a spoon.

They are the best soup dumplings that I had in Montreal by far. It'd be unfair to compare those dumplings to other offerings that you can find in other cities such as Toronto or Vancouver. But would I come back to this restaurant? Hell yeah... as soon as I can feel my whole mouth again. :P"}
{"text":"This place is particularly nice for lunch if you work in the area. The dumplings are solid - a good variety and strong execution. Everything is quite inexpensive. Be aware that the dumplings are of a specific style: thin skin, not thick skin. I like both styles so this isn't an issue with me. Interestingly, my favourite dish on their menu isn't a dumpling though. It's their tofu with \"chilli sauce\" appetizer. It's really fabulous."}
{"text":"They just opened a new one on St-Laurent, in the Chinatown which is so much bigger and much much better service! the dumplings are as good, same low price with the choice of having your little bags of joy steamed, boiled or pan-fried! my personal favorites are the traditionnal pork and cabbage, beef and coriander and shrimp and urchin! and don't forget to mix in all of the sauce (chili, vinegar and soy) to make a yummy yummy concoction! Be careful, only cash!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife loves Chinese dumplings and after reading a glowing review about this place in the New York Times, we had to go! This place did not disappoint. It was the best dumplings I've ever had outside of China itself. We started with the steamed pork and green onion dumplings and ended with the best ones (steamed shrimp, pork, and leek dumplings). They were AMAZING!

The only downside was that the service was not the best, but we forgave them since they gave us the BEST dumplings. So, so, SO good!"}
{"text":"Growing up in the San Francisco area we're used to a different kind of dim sum.  Suffice it t say though that the food here is underwhelming.  The soups were very bland and lacking in flavor, even the hot and sour.  The dumplings were very doughy and lackluster.  They obviously forgot the ginger, bamboo shoots and cilantro, not to mention other ingredients that would improve the flavor.  And the waiters had never heard of hot Chinese mustard.  Then there's the atmosphere.  White walls all nicked up from years of people banging The chairs against them.  And the noise was unbearable.  Obviously a cheap place for students.  Ignore the guide books and eat elsewhere."}
