{"text":"Great place! You should try their Pad Thai or onion rings. It's a good place for relatively cheap food!!"}
{"text":"My brother and I go here often. It's reasonably priced, the food is always ready quickly and they have a good selection of Chinese food and burgers. I love their noodle special and he likes their poutines.   The couple that owns it is nice and they remember their regular's orders. Always very happy to see you and will give you extra sauce if you request it. Nice family run place that I've been going to for a decade."}
{"text":"As others have said, the food isn't particularly good. However; the prices are amazing and the portions are enough to fill you. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're already in westdale, why not? The only thing I would say is completely revolting here is anything with gravy on it. Have had it on fries and it has burnt chunks in it and tastes super watery. Have been going since I was a little girl and no matter how long I go without going here, the family are always welcoming and remember me."}
{"text":"I don't fully understand, but I kinda like this place.  I was told it was awful, but I always see people sitting down, ordering and eating there so we decided to try it. I got the special for 4.85 + tax, which comes with 2 chicken balls, fried noodles or rice, an egg roll, and a drink.   Now usually, this food would've irritated me on account of the chicken ball being 80% flour with a dried up piece of chicken hastily stuffed in. Or the tasteless noodles? Hard to tell which would do me in.  BUT it had a very homemade taste to it. Not in a good way though; like the kind my mom made at 12am in the morning because I'd complain about being hungry. It kind of reminded me of that. Also the cheap cheap price of about $5 didn't completely fill me with rage :)   TL;DR, not the best chinese food ever. But it's cheap and it'll fill you up :)"}
{"text":"My hubby introduced me to this place a long time ago and he told me it goes way back during his childhood days that this was open. The couple who owns it are very friendly people and are always the duo who have been managing the place by themselves.  The food has ALWAYS been consistent and with that I mean it tastes the same as ever and the menu has been the same for years (nothing ever new) and I've been going here for years now when am in the area.   I always get the fried rice and chicken with sauce on the side and mind you the amount of food is plenty and the price is inexpensive. They also offer coffee, ice creams, sandwiches and burgers (and fries) but we mostly go there for their rice menu because its more plentiful for us.  You really have to eat here a bunch of times to appreciate what they have. Its a reliable place to eat within the \"mall\"."}
