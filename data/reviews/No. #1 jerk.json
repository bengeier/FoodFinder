{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken!!! Portions are huge and the chicken is cooked perfectly! If you around the Scarborough bluffs I would recommend checking out this hidden gem you won't he disappointed! !!"}
{"text":"Best Jerk chicken I have had!  Better that Oakwood & St. Clair. Corey the owner learned to cook from traditions of his grandma & heritage; all natural ingredients.  BBQ outside slow cooker."}
{"text":"On its last leg...#1 from the bottom. If you don't believe then I dare you to eat there and let me know your thoughts. \"Best Jerk Chicken\" - my *** 

Question - how do you mess up rice and beans???"}
{"text":"I just had the BEST Jerk Chicken I have ever had! We greeted by a friendly and chill guy who told as that everything was fresh and from scratch. The walls of this small restaurant has multiple pics of Bob Marley. 

We both ordered the a small Jerk chicken - it came with Cole slaw and peas and rice. The chicken was so tender and packed with flavour."}
{"text":"Amazing Jerk. Great Service. Well Priced.
I don't have anything bad to say about this place. The food is delicious, authentic and the portions are very generous. Don't forget to ask for the coleslaw, I loved it. 

There is very little seating, so ideally you'll want to do take out here. If you choose to eat in, there are a few stools against the wall. You can call ahead with your order, but they're very quick if you choose just to walk in.

Lunch time can be a bit hectic as they have a student special for the local high school, but it's worth the wait. If you go just before or after lunch, it'll be less crazy."}
{"text":"Love the food! A little expensive but it's okay because it's really good! The employees there treat you with the utmost respect and courtesy. Would definitely recommend the $5 jerk chicken special."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst jerk chicken that I have ever had in my life - please avoid at all costs. Absolutely everything was bad about it and he did not get a single thing right. When my girlfriend and I walked in during LUNCH HOURS, first thing we noticed was (1) there was nobody inside (not a big deal) and (2) those metal trays that restaurants use to keep food warm in? they were completely empty and looked like they had not been used for a long time (there was a random loaf of bread on it, on top of some other misc. items). We decided to give it a try, and boy do we regret it.

Food 0.5/5 - The food was absolutely terrible. As mentioned before, the food trays were empty during lunch hour. Oh boy that means hes cooking the food fresh right?? WRONG - the first things we heard - i kid you not - were the microwave door opening, following him microwaving our food. When we actually got the chicken, it was barely warm, and was some of the driest jerk chicken that I have ever had in my life. The peas and rice had the texture of the jasmine rice that you get at Chinese restaurants, which would be great, except thats not how peas and rice is supposed to be. We did not end up touching the rice because it also tasted terrible on top of the problems with its texture. 

Service 2/5 - The guy working there, presumably the owner, was pretty friendly. There was also a lady that looked like she was about to go clubbing and a little girl in the kitchen with him. The kitchen and overall store looked like it had not been cleaned for a long time, and just by walking into the store should send off red flags everywhere.

Price 1/5 - As I've noted in my other reviews, when you pay for bad food, you are pretty much wasting money. It did not help that this place was a little more expensive than the average jerk chicken joint (I think it was like $12 for a large?). Complete waste of money."}
