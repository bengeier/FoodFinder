{"text":"The Pad Thai tasted and also looked like a weird spaghetti. I am definitely a fan of Pad Thai but i dont think that is what this is. The red sauce they use makes it seem like something else (and not very tasty imo), its also very light on veggies and meat, mostly just noodles and the sauce. There is good stuff here but unless the above sounds good to you for the pad thai skip it. The Lo mein and singapore noodle are much better imo."}
{"text":"$20 credit card minimum? EFF YOU

The customer service sucks, they tried really hard to make us pay for their mistake

Only reason it gets a 2 stars is because I enjoyed their salt and pepper pork and fried rice. All other items are laughable."}
{"text":"I have a mixed feeling about this place, it took me a while to decide whether to give this place a 2 or 3 stars.
I personally don't like this place as much, the foods were so-so but I can't say anything very negative about it either. I have been to this place few times, not because I crave for a good Chinese food or because I love one specific dish, but simply because there wren't many other choices around Madison. That is, when I feel like Chinese foods but don't want to go to Fugu or HK Wok. 
I prefer to go to a restaurant specialized in one type of cuisine, and I'm always confused what to order in restaurants like Nam's because they have Thai, Chinese, Viet, etc. Why would they do that? I think it's because they don't have any special dish that is their forte. For this particular place, however, always gofor the Chinese and go someplace else for Thai and Viets. The Chinese dishes are decent in general, but the Viet and Thai dishes are mostly dissapointing.

So, to end this indecisive reviews, here are my reccomendations on what to order:
Singaporean Vermicelli (is this a Chinese dish? I beg to differ), egg drop soup, congees, fried rice, tofu and vegetable hotpot,.. and.. that's all I can think of! Also, try to go for lunch, coz' it's cheaper and more worth it!"}
{"text":"It's a great place!!! I love the foods there especially the avocado bubble tea (it's made with real avocado and it's so popular that they always running out of it). Some dishes can be really spicy so be carefully with that. But Don't be afraid of trying new dishes!!!!They always surprises me in a good way!!!! Also, great place to hangout with friends. Their karaoke songs are a little bit outdated......but still you can have fun there~"}
{"text":"I had the salt and pepper shrimp, which comes with a cup of soup and a dessert.  Shrimp was good, plate of about 15, served fried in a peppery batter, with some jalapenos and scallions.  You might not like that they come head-on, legs, shells and all.  Tasted really good, but annoying to eat, thinking - \"Do I look like a dumbfuck for picking off the shells?\" or \"is it dangerous to swallow so many shrimp legs?\"  Then again, sucking out that shrimp head gunk presents a dilemma too.  Do you want to look like a nasty slob or not?  I erred on the side of slob.  Burp.  

Soup was vegetable broth and cabbage, carrots, tomatos.  Why even bother, just charge me a dollar less.  FAIL

Dessert (which I had to remind the server to bring out - AFTER we got the check, thank you very much) was a thin tapioca pudding, served in a rice bowl with a soup spoon  Nice sweet (some might say cloying) taste, but the watery texture was off-putting.  FAIL"}
{"text":"I have to admit I am quite a fan of Nam's Noodles, so a part of me hopes to bump up their star-rating by writing this review. I know, I know, they serve up dishes from so many different parts of Asia, I wouldn't know how to classify Nam's other than Asian Fusion, and they really live up to that name. 

I have been a regular since a couple of years back, where a co-worker and I would go every week before our night meetings for dinner. We have tried every item on the chef's recommendation list. They used to offer complimentary soup and dessert with every meal, I wish they still have that now. I remember the soup made for a great appetizer and till this day I still miss some of the desserts they make. I don't think any of that are on the regular menu so that's sad.

On that what's good currently! They started with Belly Program, you get 5 points per visit, so it's pretty easy to get enough for a free beer or bubble tea (remember to let them know to reduce sugar levels you are not a huge fan of sweet drinks) using Belly Points. Nam's is another wonderful place on campus for noodles and congee. If you are looking for pho downtown, you can go to Nam's. If you're looking for Korean food downtown, you can go to Nam's. Nam's is a good place to go if you and your dining company are looking for different asian varieties. 

As for me I love their congee. It's only $5.50 for a huge bowl. Avocado bubble tea is also one of my favs! They make it using real avocado!! For appetizers I especially love the lemon grass chicken wings. Plus I like the fact that I get to just walk down on a day I have 1.5 - 2 hours to spare for a leisurely long lunch =) Do note that they get busy during lunch hours, but you can always call ahead if you're just getting something to go."}
{"text":"This is a nice Asian restaurant. It has a nice variety of foods, ranging from Chinese to Korean to Vietnamese. The restaurant's pho is exceptionally good. The environment is very clean, the waiters and waitresses are attentive, and the service is excellent. I highly recommend if you are feeling Asian food."}
{"text":"As an engineer student who is from China and lives south of Union South, I eat at Nams at least twice a week. Their food is not great, but it worths  the price. Three stars for the restaurant and one star for their chicken wing. I wouldn't recommend having pho here because it is not as good as Saigon."}
{"text":"Definitely exceeded expectations considering suburban-chic dining space. They have predictably huge and satisfying bowls of pho, and appetizers that were good. I'd definitely go back if I was stranded on Regent Street and didn't just want doughnuts from Greenbush."}
{"text":"So, I choose this for a birthday bash treat for myself. I had made reservations online. I should have known they didn't go through because I never got confirmation. We arrived a bit early and they were happy to accommodate us with a private Karaoke room. 
Then the problems began. I knew it would be $30 an hour for the room and I asked to pay up front. I learned that the room fees are cash only. The ATM at the restaurant was closed. So problem 1 - cash only if you want to rent a room. 
2. For $30 an hour, I must admit I want good service. We had to ask how to work the machine (45 minutes into our rental) and for the servers to take our order. So, mentally prepare yourself that you will need to ask for things rather than checked on. We didn't order a lot of drinks, so maybe that's it. 
3. Cash only after 10 pm with no warning (no sign, no mention on the website). We hadn't been given the opportunity to close out for our meal prior to 10 (bad service or they were trying to get us to use the uATM machine) - we had ordered at 8:15, so a nearly two hour delay in offering us a chance to close out and then demanding we pay with cash seems a bit harsh and not our fault. I actually had to go ask to close out and it was 10:06. Lame - and be prepared. 
In terms of the food, I ordered the Vietnamese sandwich. It was my first cold one, which was very odd. The bread was sale and tasteless. Not many vegetables and just sort of boring. I have been searching for the perfect Vietnamese sandwich since I came to madison, and sadly this one was not in the running at all. 
One other pet peeve of mine is they did not list the ingredients for potstickers etc. I have a couple of proteins I can't eat due to allergies and it would have been very helpful to know what is in the food that was ordered. 
Lastly, the karaoke list itself was a bit challenging to navigate. Since this was my first time, I'm willing to accept this as user error, but be prepared to spend some time searching for songs if you are not entirely sure what you want to sing. 
I will say a private room to chat and enjoy a birthday party was super nice. Privacy and not needing to compete with other noises at the restaurant was great. Since it was a bit of a mixed bag - I'm not entirely sure I'll be back, but if I do, I'm bringing lots of dollar bills!"}
{"text":"My family used to come here quite often, but I haven't been back in years. The food was decent - nothing too special, but the prices were pretty good for the serving size that you got."}
{"text":"I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered delivery from Nam's, so I don't know how it is in person. Their food is impressive enough to make them a regular in my delivery rotation, but pricey enough that I probably won't go for them more than once a month or so. Their lemongrass chicken wings were the dish that originally sold me on the place, with their surprising and delicious flavor combination, but all the typical americanized Chinese dishes I'd get anywhere else have been at least as good if not better than other places I've tried around Madison. I get bubble tea with every order--delicious and refreshing. My favorite so far is the honeydew milk tea, but I haven't tried them all yet. I tried one of their Vietnamese sandwiches recently, and it was too spicy for my taste, but from what I could taste after picking off all the peppers and still feeling like I was martyring my mouth, it seemed like the meat had a nice texture and the sauce was good...maybe just not my thing. 

Personally, my go-to takeout places are usually those that give huge portions, so I can justify the price by the fact that they give me yummy leftovers for a week...Nam's isn't like this, and it makes me sad. But it's still good enough to keep going back to, just not quite as frequently."}
{"text":"I like their pho and different noodles. 

Its very relax atmosphere and I like eating good food with such environment.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came by for an 'eat to bite' (name that movie... answer below) and enjoyed a satisfying pork noodle soup with pickled cabbage and a strawberry bubble drink.

The rate at which a dish exits seems a bit slow so dont think youll be in and out in 15 minutes but the food was tasty.

So a 3-4 syar rating seems reasonable.

{"text":"Best fried rice in Madison.  It is an anomaly because I'd expect larger quantities for the price like most other Asian restaurants but the quality is great. I would order more often if it was a little less expensive.  I also recommend the sweet and sour chicken and my fiancé loves the beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"Best rice I have ever had when I moved in Madison! Pho is great as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"RP11 Korean spicy pork/chicken rice plate. 
Always the best rice plate I ever had! 
It was Friday night and lots of people there. No enough space for us and the server suggested that we could sit in the KTV room..."}
{"text":"Food is great...if you receive it. Ordered three times, first time was fast, second time took 1.5 hours on a Wednesday early evening, third time called after an hour and twenty minutes, they said it was almost here, 45 minutes later called them again, said they'd check with driver...all told, no food was delivered. We won't make the mistake of hoping to eat in the future, but to be fair, if you do manage to obtain food the same day you order it, it is good. Ps - watermelon bubble tea is delicious. Good luck!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very sick of poor service and mediocre/greasy Chinese food in Madison. Thinking of trying something easy and affordable.

We were both very happy with our food, and the server was very friendly, not in an over-the-top way, just very natural and we were very comfortable.
 
They have many choices on menu and I was surprisingly happy to get congee, my ultimate comfort food from where I came from.  We asked them to cook with less oil and they did (what a relief). 

Price is pretty cheap and this unassuming place is very likely to be our regular choice in the future."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and inexpensive meal. Try the Nam's Appetizer platter and the Kim Chi Fried Rice. Be warned that their avocado milkshake is highly addictive -- you will be back!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: small Vietnamese soup place.

Nam's Noodle has got the Regent Street area of Wisconsin's campus covered in terms of easy and quick Vietnamese food in a comfortable setting, though after a few visits now I wouldn't venture away from the Pho.

My Brisket and Meatball Pho ($7.95) was extremely large (as pho often is), and had plenty of meat. The brisket was a little too gristle-y for me to get it again.

I wasn't a huge fan of the noodle dishes my friends got, though they seemed to like them. One of the dishes we ordered very mild and came out unbelievably spicy. Waitress was accommodating in getting a replacement.

Nam's Noodle is a good place to warm up with a lot of fine Pho soup, and if you want to rent a karaoke room."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more than two stars because I love karaoke and noodles and wanted this to become a go-to spot for my friends and I. Unfortunately, after a poor first experience, we probably won't be coming back. 

It started off okay - we got to our booth no problem and ordered some food and drinks. The women working at the bar seemed overwhelmed and didn't know how to make a lemon drop when my friend asked for one so I'm not sure if they were entirely trained to be behind the bar. We ordered some beef chow fun and drunken noodles which took a while to get to us and were pretty mediocre in taste. But it's karaoke so I could have excused the meh food and the long wait times. 

But closing out our tab was a pretty ridiculous affair because apparently after 10pm, they only accept cash. There was no signage, no one came into our booth before 10 to let us know this and we had a pretty large group so not everyone had cash. On top of that, the ATM in the restaurant stopped working so my friend had to go to a place down the street to grab cash. I don't know why they have this cash only policy and I really don't know why they don't make that more clear but I think my friends and I will scope out some other places for karaoke in the future."}
{"text":"They have a ton of different options at Nam's - from Chinese to Korean to Vietnamese to Thai food. I had the brisket pho when I went and it was alright. 

What's nice about this place is that it has something for everyone. It has the classic, Americanized Chinese/Korean/Thai food that a lot of people enjoy. There are also more authentic dishes for people who like that kind of food.

It's not too expensive and it's definitely a better option than anything else in the nearby area!"}
{"text":"Come here often for a quick lunch or dinner. Like the Vietnamese Pho a lot. The Chinese dishes are good too, but not many options. I liked the karaoke bar but only cash is accepted, which is not convenient. Overalls its a nice place to have meals alone or with friends when you are crazing for noodles or Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great food. The number of menu options are nearly overwhelming which is good and bad at the same time. Good lunch place and the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"At one point in my life Nam's was literally my favorite restaurant ever and I picked up lunch from there nearly every day ( I work downtown). Since then I have tamed my passion for food lol and try to eat there less so I don't overdo it. Anyways, to this day I find it very hard to find good Chinese food in the Madison Area. However, nam's hits the spot for me. I know that it is a fusion place but I feel their food is much better than even restaurants that claim to be only Chinese restaurants. I have tried many things on the menu and have never really been disappointed. I am in love with their bubble tea (especially avocado) and refuse to buy bubble tea anywhere else in Madison, the same goes for their General Tsos Chicken. When I use to come to nam's just about every day, I had built such a great relationship with the wait staff that when I called they knew it was me and knew that I wanted my usual (General Tsos and Avocado Bubble Tea). I had a favorite waiter who made the best darn bubble tea ever. Nobody makes it quite like he did! Anyways, after he left the restaurant (for whatever reason IDK) I kind of stopped going because no one could make the perfect bubble tea for me anymore. After some time I learned to accept he wasn't coming back lol and started accepting bubble tea from other servers. At first I was judgemental and usually  unsatisfied with other's Bubble Tea but I have come to be okay with it now (that or someone else is making it good again but I can't remember how the old fantastic bubble tea tasted like). Through all this, the food here stayed delicious though. I still love the general tsos chicken. I also really love their Vietnamese Eggrolls, Vietnamese sandwiches and they make probably the best fried rice dishes. I absolutely dread it when restaurants make lame and bland fried rice (just give me white rice in the case)  but Nam's has got it down! My favorites are the mango fried rice and the Thai basil fried rice."}
{"text":"A few years ago Nams was one of my favorite restaurants for their quality of food. Now it just seems to have changed, a lot. Nams Fried Rice was my favorite, now it's extremely oily and too soggy. The service is quite poor - my sister and I sat in before a few other groups and they received their food first as we waited 30 minutes.

I've eaten here a few times during work, one of the worst things on the menu is Emperors Chicken - I thought it was going to be similar to something of a General Tso's chicken, but it was an entire steamed chicken with fish sauce! YUCK!!! I'm never ordering that ever, again. Recently i've been eating their pho - for take out and dine in and it's been all well. My last dine in experience was the worst. My pho had about a pinchful of noodles and a HUGE bowl of broth & meat.......... pho? really? or is it soup? 

It's an OK place to go once in awhile."}
{"text":"This is going to be long. 

But the main point is that this place has HORRIBLE service. I read the reviews and didn't think much of them because I have been here twice before - once before the renovations and another time right before so it's been a while. I don't remember the service being this horrible. Food was okay. 

There isn't a sign that points out where the door is. There were four of us. We entered in and weren't sure what to do next. There was no sign that said to seat yourself or to wait for someone. We looked at the bar and there were three people working. Not one of them acknowledged us at all. There was a table open that would fit us. But we weren't sure if we could just seat ourselves. Was stood there like a bunch of idiots until someone from the kitchen came out to put things away. He noticed us and pointed at the table for us to sit down. He gave us menus before he went back to the kitchen. 

Already irritated we looked through the menu and decided what we wanted. We waited for someone to take our order, or at least give us water. The table next to us were only two guys. They looked bored. We wondered if they were still waiting for help or not. We waited about ten minutes with our menus closed before one of us went up to ask for someone to come take our order. 

Again, there were three people working up front; and older lady, a young lady, and a young man. The older lady came over and took our order. She said sorry and took our order while leaning against me. The other lady came by to clean off a table that just left. She also asked the two guys next to us if they've been helped. They already ordered and were waiting for their drinks. 

By boyfriend ordered pho, the main reason we came here was to try the pho, with extra everything. I ended up ordering the stewed pork because looking at the photo I thought it was going to be similar to sweet pork. I was disappointed, that was my fault. The description did say pork stewed with soy sauce. I just didn't realize that that was literally it - it was way to salty for me. And my boyfriends pho, he asked for extra everything, they didn't ask if he wasted the large or regular size (don't think the option was in the menu). Let's say there wasn't much extra at all. He was not satisfied. 

Finally we were done eating and were waiting for our check. Again, we sat for about 10-15 minutes not eating because we were done before my boyfriend went up to ask for our check. Took them about 5 minutes to bring us our check. 

My sister and I went up to split the bill. The older lady had left a while ago so it was just the two younger workers. They seemed to be working hard to help the large group that was in the karaoke room. The guy looked like he didn't know what he was doing, especially when the girl took the blender and cup from his hands to finish the drink. He took the drink into the room while she went to make a phone call. 

There was a situation with another customer and their delivery and instead of just telling the customer that they will get a 20% discount for the inconvenience, the girl asked if they wanted the discount twice to assure they they were giving them the discount. She hung up the phone and started to work on something else and then the phone rang and she picked up. The way she answered the phone was just unprofessional. After saying hello and listening to the the customer talk, she said \"huh?\" In a way like out of the blue some random stranger was talking to her in a language the she doesn't understand. Like she was annoyed. 
 -- let me say again. No one acknowledged us when we walked in and throughout this whole dinner unless we went to them. 
After helping the customer on the phone she went back to do some other work. Again not even looking at us, not even saying \"sorry I'll be with you in a moment\" or anything like that at all. 

She finally got to ringing us up after about 25 minutes of us standing there at the register. 

We didn't tip. If it were up to my boyfriend he would have just walked out without paying. 

With the food being just okay I would probably come back in the far future. But the service we didn't get was too horrible to ever go back."}
{"text":"I like nam's. Their portions are big, so I usually end up taking my food home. I find myself coming here a lot (usually alone lol but that's okay because the waiters are nice). I used to usually just get plain fried rice with some sort of chicken... Usually orange chicken. But now I'm HOOKED on their pineapple chicken fried rice. IT JUST IS DELICIOUS. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"-----------------------------------------
***THE GOOD***
-----------------------------------------
-The prices are fair and the delivery arrived ahead of schedule (with an asterisk - see the next section)

-The egg rolls are AMAZING. Next time I'm skipping the Crab Rangoon (see \"The Ugly\") and getting a double order of these delicious rolls!

-The Pad Thai was solid (maybe a poor choice of words) - I asked for medium spice and for a Midwesterner I'd say it's a pretty spicy medium but it's nice to challenge your taste buds! I could have used more chicken but overall was very pleased.

-General Tso's Chicken - really good flavor and texture. The portion was a bit small so I recommend getting some appetizers.

-----------------------------------------
***THE BAD***
-----------------------------------------
-As I mentioned, I ordered delivery and while the meal arrived ahead of time, it required reheating which makes me think it was sitting out on the counter for a while.

-By default, they don't include any soy or sour sauces in the bag (besides what comes standard with the appetizers) so make sure you have everything you need ahead of time!

-----------------------------------------
***THE UGLY***
-----------------------------------------
-My Crab Rangoon order was a complete joke. These were essentially just near-empty fried shells with about half a teaspoon of filling. Skip these and, like I say above, go for the double order of egg rolls. Seriously, these were so empty that I posted a photo of them to Instagram because I couldn't believe my eyes and needed the validation of social media to prove I wasn't missing something.

-The coupons on GrubHub that they offer are laughable. An order of $25 or more (excluding tax, delivery, and tip) get's a can of soda? $30 or more is the same thing but with bubble tea as an option? Please. The other Madison area Asian food restaurants offer much better coupons."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nam's for many years, they've probably changed management and maybe owners and chefs.  One thing remains I've never been disappointed.  My current favorite is the Hunan Beef.  It crispy well flavored and the little bit of sauce is excellent.  My all time favorite is the Nams fried rice.  I think it has a unique sweeter flavor than most fried rice dishes and come with an egg on top.  The general tso is common pretty good.  The sauce isn't too sweet, if you let it cool down it isn't so hard you can't eat it.  Sometime general tso gets fried and too hard, but nams is much better than that.

Everything else I've had is pretty good, not the most amazing, but good to very good."}
{"text":"went their twice, both with another friend for lunch. The vietnam noodles there is strongly recommended, it is well prepared."}
{"text":"Best sesame chicken in madison, I ever had. Though I study nearby, never tried this place. I loved Ginger root's sesame chicken till the fortunate day I was forced to eat at Nam's. Their gravy had the perfect combination of sweet and sour taste. Chicken was cooked properly and was paired excellently with white rice and a roll. Service was very good and food was on the table in no time. Will definitely visit again. Chicken lovers rejoice!!

EDIT : It was a lunch special menu item."}
{"text":"To be fair, I only went here once a few months ago. It was a Wednesday and not a busy night.  It's near where I live so I was hoping it would be good.  I will have to try it again, but it's difficult to try a place again and possibly have another bad experience when we have so many good places so I will likely wait until soemone I know recommends it.
Service was poor.  Took over ten minutes to be greeted while staff chatted at bar and kept going to karaoke area.  Was not asked about refill when water and beer were out.  Food (noodle bowl with veggies) was greasy (not in a good way), salty (not in a good way) and bland otherwise. Area behind the bar was less than clean. 
I walk by often and do not see many customers, even college kids, so I suspect they still need to get their act together.  Hope they do.  Great location."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Nam's with my family and we were all very happy and satisfied with the whole experience! Even my 2 year old son who is picky about everything enjoyed their crab Rangoon's and bubble tea. The Korean rice cakes were incredible, and the lunch specials they had available were appealing. Definitely can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I've visited several times, and the food is always great. They are known for their soups, and I definitely recommend trying one. They have rich broths, healthy ingredients, and of course delicious noodles. Their other offerings are all great. Try something new!

Service can be hit or miss. During lunch the service can be a bit hectic and slow, so plan for an hour. My server didn't know the details of the soup I wanted to order.

I always order a bubble tea to go after lunch. They are awesome!"}
{"text":"very impressed by the delicious food here. the noodle was full of flavor and authentic. fry chicken is definately the best in madison. will definately come back again!!!"}
{"text":"The service can be a bit tied up, but Zack is a very nice manager and accomodating if you're not having a good experience. The service was pretty fast even when it's busy!

Love the food here. Everything I order is very good especially the Pho Noodles. Usually, it requires for a place to specialize in Pho for it to be good; but, I would argue that this place gives Pho a great name. The broth is cooked consistently, which allows it to be good. Also! I would really recommend the smoothies. Most of the smoothies are made with fresh fruit.

They also have karaoke, beer and spirits for game day, which is nice. Large groups and small groups are pretty good for this place. Would I go here again? Absolutely and bring friends so they have a great experience. Casual with college students, but great restaurant overall."}
{"text":"I live nearby and there aren't as many restaurants as there are on State Street. Nam's is my first pick on this side of the campus. My favorites include spicy beef shank noodles and mapo tofu for a simpler and quicker meal. The dish here in general is not the same as what you would have in China, but it is modified in a more pleasant way than it is in many other Chinese restaurant in Madison. That is less greasy and less soy sauce. One cool thing about the mapo tofu is you can opt for beef in stead of pork. The Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce or garlic sauce is my favorite veggie dish and it is done in an authentic way. The beef casserole is also tasty and authentic. 
The potential factor for a bad dining experience here is the karaoke party. Although the karaoke is done in separated rooms, if you encounter lousy but loud singers like I have once, it can still be a major turn off."}
{"text":"One of the 2 places I often go for dinner (the other is Hong Kong station). The Vietnamese food there are quite delicious. I like various Phos and fried rice there. Waitresses/Waiters there are professional, and even when there are many people eating there, you can expect your dishes coming in the reasonable amount of time.  Moreover, you can use the \"belly\" card to earn points and get free drinks, phos and fried rice. Overall, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had their pho.  It was OK... the broth was really salty and tasted like a lot of MSG.  I didn't think it was anything special.  We were the only ones there other than one other group at about 11:30am on a weekday.  It was packed by the time we left around 12:30.  I've heard their karaoke is pretty good, will probably be back to try that out, but probably not for their pho."}
{"text":"I come to eat at Nam's noodle pretty often. I like vietnamese noodle salad, Pho, and kimchi fried rice. The service is fine. It tastes good in general."}
{"text":"As it's name suggests, Nam's Noodle's best dishes are indeed Chinese noodles and Vietnamese pho. There's a good selection here and it is more expensive than most other Asian restaurants, but the food isn't bad. 

In my opinion, the clutch items on the menu at Nam's Noodle is the Vietnamese sandwiches. Although it's just okay here, I couldn't find this specialty anywhere else in Madison. In addition, I like that this place offers bubble tea (and a semi-full bar well).

But even better is the fact that this place has karaoke rooms!! I've actually been a more frequent patron of their karaoke systems than their food. They've recently installed a new system and their software is actually constantly updated and pretty legit, offering the newest English, Chinese, and Korean songs. The owner is pretty nice too and on occasion has charged my friends and I less per hour when there are fewer customers."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends for dinner and we were all disappointed. 

The dining area is pretty small, but there is a cute little bar. Nam's is in the campus area, so it's not where I usually like to hang out. Thankfully it was a quiet night, so service should have been fine. Should have been...

My friends got their food pretty quickly and I expected mine to follow within a minute or two. I sat and waited and waited. A good 15 or so minutes passed and our waitress hadn't returned. Finally, another employee came to ask if we needed drink refills. I mentioned I was still waiting on my pho and he was really apologetic and fixed things. I got my meal and drinks for free. This was the appropriate reaction, and I'm thankful for that particular staff member for fixing things. The waitress was all like \"Oh, he didn't get his food?!\" and that was a bit perplexing.

And while they fixed things and I got  free food/drinks, it doesn't really cover up the fact that their food is mediocre. The pho was very blah and my companions complained about cheap quality of the chicken served. We all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience.

All I wanted was a good pho, and man was I disappointed. Should have went to Ha Long Bay instead."}
{"text":"It's a good lunch. I went there at an odd time and I think I was the only one in there so fortunately service wasn't a problem. I had something pretty simple and it reminds me a lot of Saigon Noodle(on the west side)."}
{"text":"Had a lot of variety when it comes to Asian food. I got the kimchi fried rice and it was delicious! I've also had the porridge there and tastes just like how my mom makes it. I saw the menu and they have Pho, curry, along with other Asian dishes! I'll definitely go back and try the other stuff!"}
{"text":"I have been very happy with soups orders from Nams. However, the chicken general Tao is disappointing. It has no meat inside it seem just skin or batter."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but I've had a bad experience every time I've ordered from them. A few weeks ago, I ordered delivery from Nam's and my food took almost an hour longer than the estimated arrival time. When I finally received my food, there was a curly black hair sitting directly on top of my curry. Luckily, I still had my crab rangoons and I was able to eat those, but I certainly had no appetite for the curry... I called Nam's as soon as I found the hair and was told by the employee that answered the phone that he would \"leave a note\" about getting me a free entree next time I ordered from them. Well, I just ordered food from them again and received a very rude phone call from one of the workers demanding to know why I was receiving a free entree. Let's just say that I am a little insulted that, after I gave them a second chance, they would call me and accuse me of lying to get free food. 

Side Note: After being reassured that my food would be here in 45 minutes, it has now been an hour and I am officially never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Vegetarian spring rolls were good, but vegetarian fried rice was not tasty and didn't look very appetizing.  Also, ordered online and had to wait well past expected pickup time."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and cozy environment the staff is very attentive and friendly as well"}
{"text":"Lunch at Nam's on Wednesday, Sunday and again on Monday.  1st visit was good!  Ordered three dishes(tofu, noodles and a chicken with peanuts) to share-all were tasty.  Excited to bring more people to try.  2nd visit they were busy...we sat in the kaoroke room.  Service was not at its best. We ordered kabi, pho, and chicken stir fried and something else, all mediocre. I understand all cooks have their off days but seriously!?  3rd visit was terrible ordered the japchae lunch special served with an egg roll.  It was way too greasy. Informed the server I can't eat this, its too greasy.  I told the server to please let the kitchen know, less oil.  His respond, they don't care.  All rightly then.  I was hoping they can remake it with less oil.  Nope.  2bites, left $15 including tip.  Good bye Nam!  Lots of choices in the Regent area."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nam's since they opened, over 10 years ago. This spot was a favorite of mine and my hubby's. The food is tasty and the staff is friendly. My favorites are the Nam's fried rice and the chicken stick noodle (similar to a chow fun). We moved out of the state for a while and upon my return I found that their menu has since expanded and they now have many new yummy dishes.  That being said, I love my tried and true dishes."}
{"text":"My brother and I ordered takeout the other night and this place is the bomb dot com. The Korean Spicy Beef Tofu and Mushroom Soup is everything. I can't say enough about how good this soup is. In the past I have ordered takeout from Nam's Noodles as well and loved everything, but I haven't actually been in the restaurant since I was a kid. Total win, though."}
{"text":"I ordered Vietnamese fresh rolls and pho.  The pho was okay, it was not the best Pho I've had, and I think it was below par for the midwest as a whole.  I'm starting to think though that Madison simply doesn't have the Asian food thing going...so by Madison standards this place might be a little better.

The fresh rolls were not very good.  They were just rice noodles, bbq pork, shrimp, and lettuce.  There was no cilantro or mint, nor any other fresh herbs--which I think is a key ingredient.  Without fresh green herbs, the fresh rolls have little flavor.  I also think the noodles used in the rolls were too big, and there was too much meat.  And the meat (both the shrimp and pork) had been cooked in a sauce that was too sweet.  This made the rolls come across as heavy, starchy, and bland.

The pho was mediocre.  I've had worse, but I'd say this is in the lower quartile of pho quality I've encountered.  The broth was heavy on the cinnamon, lacked complexity, and tasted too sweet (possibly because of too much cinnamon).

On the side I was given bean sprouts, lime, and hot pepper, but no cilantro and no basil...which in my opinion is essential.  Again, the experience was disappointing.

I could be convinced to come back to this place.  It is possible that the chefs aren't Vietnamese and just don't know how to make this type of food well.  But if I came back, I would order something different.  And as it is, this place gets two stars.  I'm no culinary genius, but the mistakes / omissions this place made were VERY basic.  Just use more fresh herbs--that's why I like Vietnamese food, and without that, I'd rather just eat at home."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent, I usually go for their pho. Their chicken wings are also quite amazing. It has many other options. Other than that, I think it is usually not that packed, when other joints nearby are. Staff is pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"Good reasonable place to go get Pho. Everything else is so-so I would have to say. But hey, if you enjoy singing, there's the karaoke."}
{"text":"Service is impecable, food is consistent, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Great food! Hot & Sour soup is amazing.  Delivery does take a little long but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Rap music and Asian food. I might start watching football here."}
{"text":"Use to work here and eat here everyday. Always amazing. Great owners. I moved to the east coast and tried pho and noodle salads, but out of everywhere I've been Nams is my favorite! The appetizers are made in house. Fresh delicious authentic! Wish I could grub hub order it  right now."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian egg rolls I have ever had! The vegetarian pot stickers were really good too. Our waitress was great. She was clearly very busy but was attentive and helpful. My husband and I were really just looking for a quiet place to sit for a little while to get away from the game day madness before the Ohio State game and found some of the best food of our trip!"}
{"text":"Very good pad thai and bun, which is hard to come by in Madison. Better than many of the other Asian places I've tried. Reasonable prices and easy to get in and out of quickly at lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian food spot in Madison, we get take out here probably every other week, however I'm tempted to rent out the karaoke room :) haha"}
{"text":"They serve Americanized Chinese dishes, which is strange. My friend got the duck soup. There were tons of bones in it, including little ones. She didn't eat much of it. The prices are also expensive. You can do karaoke here, but it's expensive too. I basically left this place feeling like I didn't get my money's worth. Oh, and they have a credit card limit of $20 so my party of four who wanted to split the check had to pay each other back after charging one card. The service wasn't great either...will not be going back."}
{"text":"I like Nam's Noodles. They have solid food-never extraordinary, but never, ever disappointing- and the service is quick. Plus, they have bubble tea, and most Asian restaurants like this place don't! Major plus! This restaurant is in a good location, too. Would recommend the mango chicken fried rice!"}
{"text":"We ordered pad Thai and orange chicken. 
Chicken was microwaved and cold inside. Pad Thai was made with wrong spices. 
It was close to RedHotel and decided to give it a shot. Food was very bad and lowest quality Asian food I ever had. 
Wish I could give it less than 1 star."}
{"text":"Don't really know what they really mean by Nam but it's definitely not a Vietnamese restaurant. The name is quite misleading.

The pho is below average but i guess ppl just simple dont have an option in Madison though. If you want to have decent pho/vietnamese foods, you have to go all the way to the west side for saigon noodles. Madison sucks"}
{"text":"Is owned by the same people who own dragon I and serves the same exact food. I would say it's probably the best Asian food restaurant in the Regent / Monroe area, but not in Madison.

Like dragon I, the entrees are over priced and are often a hit or miss. Some dishes are very authentic ( such as the pho and topokee) and others are very Americanized. Most of the dishes I've tried have been suggestion (not on the menu) from friends  .If I'm feeling sick, I typically order pho from them, and that is usually pretty good. I've also tried the kimchi fried rice, which was pretty yummy as well.

In terms of the decor and the place itself, it's pretty low key but is not a nasty hole in the wall. Would be a nice play for a cute date if you're in that area and are having some Asian food cravings."}
{"text":"I have to be honest in that the two stars I'm giving isn't really all that fair to Nam's Noodle.

I can only eat one dish at this place as I've got a food allergy to onions; knowing full well that onions are critical to taste for a lot of dishes, I try and stick to this one dish. Also because I generally feel guilty if I have to ask to have it removed. With that said, the one dish I can eat here is OK; the barbecued honey pork ribs are pretty solid and have a pretty decent taste, but it's nothing extraordinary.

The service isn't phenomenal either; they do what they're supposed to, but they don't really go above and beyond. Also, you have to spend $20 to be able to run a credit card here, so for someone that rarely has cash, $20 is a bit too much to spend on mediocre food.

But Nam's saving grace is its traditional-style karaoke rooms. Although a lot of the songs are mostly Asian (and by this, predominantly Korean, Japanese and Chinese), there are American/English songs there as well. And while they're only MIDI-versions of the songs, it still provides a lot of fun if you've got a lot of friends with you.

I've got some pretty good memories associated with this place, but it's not somewhere I go to a lot anyways."}
{"text":"Best BUBBLE TEA in town.  They're a bit inconsistent about the bubbles - I think they may let batches get pretty old before pitching them and making more--as bubble tea fans know, it's ALL in the bubbles.  So while not every bubble tea I have ever had here is awesome, they are still the best in town."}
{"text":"Came it for dinner one night and it wasn't busy until after I sat down. Crowds seem to follow me wherever I go. ;)

There was only one server and she seemed flustered. It was a while before I got my water. She kept apologizing to almost every table. They need to consider hiring an extra person to help.

I ordered the pho that was a combination and I asked them to take out the tripe. It was a perfect amount of soup and noodles. Not a lot of meat even though it was the combination. 

I'm interested in trying the rest of their menu. I'll be back for sure and hopefully they get extra help."}
{"text":"I ordered the Korean short ribs and the mango bubble tea. The Korean short ribs were a little disappointing, not grilled enough And a bit too chewy. The mango bubble tea was delicious. Generous portion and quick delivery."}
{"text":"5 stars for layout and Sony TV and the MUSIC!!! jamming baby. 
4 stars for food
4 stars for wifi password provided when asked then updated and a sign made upon return visit
Location, decor, layout, number of people and turnover on tables makes this a great place for dinner. 

ATM inside. 

Pho is ok. Good enough but not great. 
Crab Rangoons - I'd stay away from and just get them from Orient house 
Extra cilantro - no problem. 
Please let half our crew order first then the rest will order later = NO Problem.

Servers = all sweet guys. 

Rereading this I guess that TV and music truly made an impression because the Pho is good the service is ok and wifi is plentiful in Madison but the ambience sells you on everything here. can't wait to go for Karoke. I like how they have their floor plan set up as it works."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but I think I can safely say that I've never had drinks that were as watered down as the vodka cranberries my wife and I had here. We racked up something like a $60 bar bill during an intense karaoke session without feeling so much as a buzz.

Y'know what, Nam's? We got you back. When we returned here (and to their other co-owned location, Dragon-I) we just started packing a few flasks (actually, one time it was an entire 1.75 liter bottle of vodka that I concealed under my coat). Take that, Nam's!"}
{"text":"ONCE UPON A TIME I WAS FALLING IN LOVE, BUT NOW I'M ONLY FALLING APART. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO, A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART!

Imagine a little Bonnie Tyler with an elaborate Korean soap opera taking place in the background. That's pretty much what you get doing Karaoke at Nam's and it's AWESOME. Grab a private room and sing your heart out, cuz this place rocks!"}
{"text":"The food here are decent, and the options weren't much the last time I went. Considering their location being so close to the private Regent street dorm, it's good place to grab short lunch. The broth taste of the soup is okay and the dry combo noodle is also just so-so. I think this place is good for just like short break lunch and if you have nothing else to eat as an option."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is slow. I ordered delivery recently during lunch time and it took almost an hour and a half for the food to arrive. In fact, they pushed back the delivery time. Not to mention, I left a 20% tip and ordered a lot of food. I don't think I'll be ordering from here any time soon."}
{"text":"Always came here to eat whenever I skipped in high school and they never disappoint me. Their food is alright, but the dishes that shine the most are their fried rice dishes and their bubble tea, would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I love Malaysian fried rice here although it's not as spicy as I would have imagined before. and the pho is pretty good. gotta be my safe choice to eat!"}
{"text":"It's a decent place but the food is hit or miss. I've had some great food as well as some really lousy stuff....once my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week old!
Ok to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't travel much for it."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot for engineering grad students/profs. The lunch special (~$8) comes with soup, large volume of food + spring roll. The service is super quick. I ordered Kung Pao beef - wasn't impressed, but wasn't repulsed by it either. Next time, I plan to order something with noodle. I figured that they might do the better job at noodle since it's in the restaurant name. From a quick glance of the menu, seems like they've got, pho, chow main(or chow-fun as it is called in midwest), and rice noodle dish. They even  have hot-pot, which is a favorite of my friend's advisor."}
{"text":"Love Nam's! I get the mango chicken rice and it's FABULOUS! I have to check out the karaoke some night with friends."}
{"text":"Manager refused to exchange poor plate (cartilage and beef fat instead of beef). Egg yolk in fried rice was hard fried to rubber and the sauce served with the crab Rangoon was not very good. Poor service included no drink refills and zero visits from waiter until we wanted to pay. Even then we had to walk up to the bar. There was a grand total of 12 customers in the restaurant, no excuse for poor service."}
{"text":"I come to Nam's quite a bit for very specific dishes.  It is my belief that for asian restaurants in Madison, one has to pinpoint the original ethnicity of the restaurant to get the best food.  The original owner is from Hong Kong and has some vietnamese influence in his life.  With that in mind, I really enjoy the bun, their mi (noodle soups), and their pho.  I know a lot of people complain about the pho here, but I like it for its meatiness, which is not something I find in a lot of the other Vietnamese restaurants in Madison.  The bean sprouts and basil that usually accompany the soup are a bit lacking though.  In addition, their traditional chinese food is pretty good as well (like their congee).  From personal experience, I would not get the americanized chinese food....or the Pad Thai.  This place isn't even remotely Thai.  
For the food that I do like, I give it 4, maybe even 5 stars, but for the confusing menu, I have to go with 4"}
{"text":"I go here specifically for the best congee in Madison, IMHO. The yo tiao is hot, fresh, and plentiful. Congee is the ultimate comfort food and a weekend treat. Also like the kimchee wraps. Cowabunga!"}
{"text":"Got the beef pho for dinner, overall I'd call this average at best. There was very little meat and two (TWO!) basil leaves to add to my bowl. The broth evoked the aftertaste of a cigarette (that might just be me, but it wasn't pleasant).

Nam's doesn't even touch the quality of Saigon Noodles. I'd recommend going to Saigon instead if you have the time, though I haven't had any luck contacting them to order takeout. If you're a pho lover, you'll probably be disappointed at Nam's."}
{"text":"Had Vietnamese mixed meat noodle soup. Some of the best noodles I've had in madison. The broth was amazing though, countless flavors from beginning to end. A real delight and satisfying portion. Def goin back"}
{"text":"I have driven by Nam's Noodle many times but have never stopped.  I had an event that brought me to that part of Regent Street and I had time for dinner, so it was my first thought.

The restaurant dining room is a clean, well managed space with a good flow to the tables (they must survive football game days really well).  My Server was attentive and pleasant.  The bathrooms are very well cared for and the photos there were beautiful.  The menu is expansive.  Asian dishes from many origins.  So it really just depended on what I was looking for. 

I chose the Nam's Fried Rice Combination and the Thai Style Fried Calamari.  The rice had a good flavor and had chicken, pork, and seafood mixed in with an egg on top. I would get that again if I wasn't too busy trying the other delicious sounding options.  I was not really impressed by the Calamari.  The dish was chewy and kinda boring.  The squid was served as coated rings over a bed of greens, onions, and jalapeno.  It was not how I had squid in Thailand when I was there.  The squid in the fried rice was handled better.

I do look forward to trying more options at Nam's again.  I'm sure it will earn more stars in the future"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for the first time. I ordered the beef brisket in casserole. Very impressed with how it turned out. The brisket was very tender and  the flavor was excellent. My husband enjoyed his dish of noodle salad as well. Would definitely go back and try other dishes and bring a few friends and try their karaoke."}
{"text":"I like their famous kimchi beef fried rice (with an egg on top!), but haven't got into any good noodle dishes so far."}
{"text":"Wisconsinites, winter is coming. No better way to warm up than a well-made pho! Although it doesn't end there. Awesome Pho's, BUT even better fried rices! Pro-Tip: Nam's Friedr Rice with a side of Lemon Grass Chicken. ALSO, the pickled pork, although unappetizing to the ear, is worth the try!"}
{"text":"Worst Pad Thai and Fried Rice we've ever had!
If you're gonna add cilantro, add that in the description! My entire dish tasted like soap because of it. And as for the Fried Rice, I don't believe the chicken nor the shrimp can technically count as either. 
One positive note to add is that the delivery time was very quick. But we won't be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Googled worth. Food was great. Parking was another story, 110 dollar tow and parking ticket."}
