{"text":"This place used to be the top dog in the city.  There was some ownership issues a few years ago so it's not quite the same as it used to be.  Make no mistake, the prices are the same but the quality is not.  Back when it first opened this was the place to be seen for the Asian Gucci/LV crowd.  I'm just a pee-on but our family is connected to a wealthy and generous couple who hosted their daughter's wedding there back around year 2000.  The meals were $1000 a table for the banquet menu and there were over 40 tables.  They left a tip so big that the manager came back to ask if they made a mistake.  Needless to say, we get the royal treatment whenever we show up for dim sum or dinner.   Even if the place is packed, we get the next available seat.  I think they started the whole 2 tiered seating system which is only good if you're a regular otherwise you take a number in the front and wait forever.   For years we came here as regulars and we probably know more than we like to share with the public.  Since the ownership issues, we have gone elsewhere.  The Chinese 2 tier thing is a bit too much for a simple guy like me and as Katrina L. accurately describes in her review, that mooncake thing is crazy and worse if you're like me and don't eat it.  The food here is definitely good but is it worth the prices? For me, no but some will dispute it.  Abalone and shark fin is way overrated.    2 years ago this same wealthy friend threw a retirement party there.  I've never had a $3000/table meal and will unlikely experience it again.  It was really something else but it's only for those who can appreciate exotic food and have the means to spend it.  We attended a wedding banquet in January 2010 and I noticed the quality was sliding.  We rarely go here as we live downtown now but aside from the distance, it's really not as good as it used to be.  3.5 stars rating overall."}
{"text":"This is a great Dim Sum place. My friend and her family would often take me here and the dishes are always pipping hot and delicious. The staff are super friendly and tentative. The line ups are rather large, but the wait is totally worth it. I wish this place wasn't so far, or I would come back more often."}
{"text":"Very clean and elegant. Excellent place to impress people for dim sum. Their ingredients are more superior than most places. Definitely a higher class Chinese restaurant with consistency. But I think Mansion still beats it"}
{"text":"My mom finally persuaded me to come back here last week after it was placed on my blacklist because I spotted a cockroach on the wall in 2009. (Mom: \"Come on. It was a skinny roach, which meant it had nothing to eat. And, that was before they finished the renovations in the adjacent food court, he was just here while displaced from his home.\")  The food was ok, and I didn't spot any roaches this time, but I'm not coming back any time soon. We arrived around 11:30am for dim sum, but there wasn't a lot going around. We ended up ordering noodles because we were hungry and the same seven carts were going around. It was only when we left around 1pm that more stuff started coming around. (Dad: \"Was the chef/staff stuck in traffic on the way back from Casino Rama?\") This was a Tuesday, so maybe weekends are better, but then you'd have to fight with a bigger crowd."}
{"text":"Very fun experience for Dim Sum on a weekend. It's loud and the place is buzzing. Food is excellent and the cart pusher/ waitress are very nice even though there is a language barrier present. The best Dim Sum in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Food was ok, only ok. Not as good as it used to be. Price is definitely overrated, the decor, atmosphere, service, and food do not worth that much... And pan fried tulip cake is a specialty??!!!...  Cluster bun is great, I will probably go back for that one. Other than that I would say it's just normal regular Toronto dim sum standard."}
{"text":"good food. worth the trip up brimley. but...do not leave a tip in the receipt tray. the owners keep the tips and do not give them to the servers. tip the wait staff directly. very bad form on the owners part. shame for extorting the wait staff in this way!!!!"}
{"text":"Remember coming here awhile back for a banquet meal that was awesome tasting. The dim sum however, was only okay. Not near as memorable as dinner.   Service was typical Chinese style, kinda there, kinda of not. I came during a time when they were selling new year cakes and lots of it (so many were leaving with them), maybe that distracted the servers.   Traditional fight the front mob for a table and push cart style place. Our table was on a path that looked less frequented by the carts, so we didn't get to see a large variety of items.   This place does have the \"street style huts\" on the side that cook some of the dumplings, congee and boiled vegetables.       If I happen to be in the plaza and hungry, I won't mind going back. But not a place I'd venture out of the way to go to."}
{"text":"Some of the best traditional dim sum dishes served on push carts style that you can get in GTA nowadays.  The rice wrapper rolls, the ha gow shrimp dumplings, the glutinous steamed rice, the desserts on and on it goes, it never gets boring, always great quality."}
{"text":"This is my favourite dim sum place in Toronto! There is a big variety of traditional dimsum, and they use the carts to wheel the food around. Somehow when the food comes around, it still manages to be steaming hot and fresh. You won't find anything fusion here, it is just no-nonsense dim sum.  A bite into the har gow (shrimp dumplings) actually gets you a mouthful of plump, juicy shrimp, instead of a glutinous mixture of lard and shrimp that you get at other dim sum places. You leave dim sum here feeling like you just had a calorie splurge, but your body wouldn't be struggling to pump blood.  Rice noodles have thin skin, and are stuffed with filling. Spare ribs dish is the best -- they add bits of taro in there and it is delightfully flavoured.  The dim sum is a bit pricy, similar to Casa, but the quality makes it worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be my family's go to restaurant, like, way, way back (when I was still in grade school!) This place has definitely changed and it's a place I only go to for dim sum (and when I am in the area).  Dim Sum selection is really wide and it's still served on rolling carts. But, sitting near the bathroom area (that hallway with the private nook) sucks as food rarely gets there and you constantly have to stand up and get the lady's attention. There is a lot of fried dim sum dishes and my absolutely fave is the fried shrimp/mayo/mango roll...so greasy that it burns your fingers.  Not the best dim sum, but certainly an experience for those who want to see those rolling carts."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since they opened. The Contonese food served here is excellent.   The dim sum is good and I have never been let down. I also have had parties here for dinner and the food was great. The duck was just as good as I have eaten in China.   I have travelled all over China on business for many years...it's just like eating in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Me trying to review an asian restaurant in the burbs was always going to be the worlds shortest review.   This place is apparently very popular, but I was there for a friend's menu tasting session leading up to his wedding so since the food was free I would find it hard to complain about.   So plenty of yumminess and great service but since I did not actually order off the menu I am not sure how much this counts but hey go check it out and try for yourself."}
{"text":"Was originally going to go to the Pearl of Asia Restaurant at the Oriental Shopping Mall only to find out that it is currently closed for renovation.  So, seeing as Dragon Dynasty was just up the street - we drove on up.  I have only had a rather disappointing dinner experience at the Dragon Dynasty, and whenever we go dim sum with the family he decision-making is usually not in my hands, so I decided to see if my own dim sum experience would redeem a previous \"meh\" dining experience.    I arrived around 10:15ish, so the restaurant was still relatively empty... However at around 11:00am when the HK families who are natural late-risers on weekends decided to form mobs at the dim sum restaurants, a line-up was starting to form.  The furniture is started to become a bit dated as you can see the chair covers are starting to become moth bitten.    For the size of the restaurant, there were not enough waiters to cover the floor.    They have push carts, as well as a \"dim sum specials\" card that you can tick off for some specialty items.  From the specials menu I ordered an egg yolk custard bun.  What makes this different from a regular custard bun is the texture of the filling has a rather sandy texture which is the result of using a salted egg yolk, which is much richer in flavour.  I know you're thinking \"WTF?  A salted egg yolk in my dessert?  Nasty!\" But trust me, it is delicious!  I think they could've been a little more generous with the filling, as I love custard buns that have a thin bun and is oozing with filling.  This was not the case at DD.    Also on the dim sum specials menu is the Egg White Custard (yes I love all things eggy and creamy!) served in a whole steamed papaya - however, the waiter told me that it was only available after 11:30AM when a certain chef arrived.  Since I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere, we waited.  It should also be noted that this dish takes 20 minutes prep time, so you will want to order it as soon as you sit down if you are impatient or pressed for time.   It was steamed in a baby papaya, and it was very delicious yet light at the same time.  The sweetness and semi-firmness of the papaya contrasted the creamy-smooth egg whites quite well.  This was definitely a delight!  By the way, I should warn you that this dish alone comes at a hefty price of $9.50, but IMHO it was worth every penny.  Ladies, if you didn't already know, papaya and egg whites = very good for women's health!    It should be noted however, that when most Chinese restaurants post the word \"specials\" - it means that the dishes are being offered at a discount; this rule doesn't apply at Dragon Dynasty.  Specials simply means \"out-of-the-ordinary\" dim sum items.  From the push carts we ordered: BBQ Pork Bun - Can't comment as I don't usually like eating buns at dim sum.  It fills you up too fast and then you don't get to try much else.    Chicken Feet - I was fooled by the pale colour into thinking that it meant that it wasn't going to have deep flavours, but I was wrong!  Quite tasty, and is also braised with peanuts.  Shrimp Dumpling - Standard.  Nothing to Yelp about.  Beef Rice Noodle Roll - The rice noodles were quite soft.  But again, rather standard dim sum fare.  The bill came to $32.  Considering that we didn't eat much, it is pricier than most dim sum restaurants.  But it is more spacious, and more comfortable than cheaper dim sum restaurants in the area.  I didn't think that the service was good though (which is usually what you're paying for).    My conclusion is that DD is a restaurant I probably would come back to for Dim Sum, definitely not dinner.  But given a choice, I'd choose Casa Imperial."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dim sum restaurants! So sad that they don't have the push carts anymore. Aside from that, food is anyways great and service is great. My favorite dish is the curry cuttle fish. A definite try. The BBQ pork buns are the steamed ones(white buns). So moist and fresh"}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Toronto. Push dim sum cart services is diminishing in Chinese restaurant. It is the best traditional way to served dim sum. You can pick whatever you see fit your appetite and order them from the cart. Dragon Dynasty had the freshest dim sum & it tastes the best.  In addition, this restaurant had the most variety of dim sum dishes that you can pick. Some rare items that you do not see in other restaurants are the deep fried pigeon. They serve this during dim sum on weekend and the taste is comparable to the Hong Kong famous pigeon restaurant called Lun Wah in Sha Tin. The other rare dish that no other places offer is the pork blood. I love to use this & mix it with the fish congee soup.  This make the best congee and Chinese believes the pork blood can cleanse your system up especially for those who works in construction or hair cutting industries.  The sweet egg puff that you seldom find in other places can also be found here. It is very fluffy and soft. This item is made with a lots of egg and make it smells and taste excellent."}
{"text":"On weekdays, their small, medium and large dim sum plates are a flat rate of $2.99 each! One of my favorite, the stewed beef tripe (regularly priced as a large) is on this list! With a few drops of chili oil, this stuff takes the cake!  I want to vouch for the quality here. The leaves they use for what is loosely translated as pearl chicken (glutinous rice filled with a super savory minced chicken filling, wrapped in lotus leaves and steamed) is incredibly fragrant and delicious, even when brought home and microwaved. The same can be said of their large, savory glutinous rice packets wrapped in lotus leaves and steamed in the same way.  Writing this review and thinking about that beef tripe though...it's definitely giving me a craving."}
{"text":"I used to come here more frequently than I do now but if I remember correctly, it's still the same. They've got great selection for dim sum and there's constantly servers and managers and people walking around.   The reason I stopped coming here? We got to know all the servers and hostess and managers really well here, but they work on commission. What exactly does that mean? Well, first off, they don't get a share of the tips, the tips goes directly to the owner and the workers get a flat rate, it is higher than other places but you get what I mean. Second, when they are selling items like moon cake for Mid Autumn Festival or taro pancake for New Years, they get a percentage of what they sell. Well, when you get to know everyone, EVERYONE tries to get you to buy from them. We ended up having 12 boxes of moon cake, 15 different types of cake thingies and what not. It's ridiculous and you honestly can't say no or else they'll spit in your food/tea.  In spite of all that, their food is really good. It's fresh and non-greasy and there's a lot of it. You can eat so many different things. My personal favourite is a dessert, I can't tell you the specific name of it but it's got tapioca in it and it's like a custard. It is my all time favourite and this place is basically the only restaurant I know that makes it.   As much as the food is wonderful, getting to that point is horrendous. There is a tiered system that they use: if you know a server or manager or the hostess, you stand elsewhere, if you don't, you stand in the front. Now of that group that \"knows\" someone, they are split into the ones that frequent more often and the ones that you sort of know and come weekly or bi-weekly. This makes the process extremely slow as they give to that group of people first and leave the rest for after they've all been seated. I once waited for a table of 3 for 45 minutes on a weekday. Aboslutely ridiculous.   But people keep coming back for the food and the cleanliness. They recently renovated (an already nice restaurant) and put some of that popular dark panelling that everyone is using.   Best time to come? Weekday between 11am-11:30am, any time after that and you're so screwed with seating."}
{"text":"Just like their prime competitor, Ruby, this place is packed and represents the crazy weekend crush for dim sum that scares most newcomers. Table seating can be based on knowing the host and preference is given the those in the know. The dim sum is fairly cheap but fairly tasty too. But several of our dishes came out a bit cold and the textures just didn't match up with some other places. Solid."}
{"text":"Came here once for dimsum then twice for wedding dinners! Both were very, very good epxeriences, although the price is proportionally higher considering the calibre of food you get.  Their dimsum is better than the average restaurant and there are some pretty unique options there. The rice noodles are definitely on par - thin skins and lots of filling inside.  Some dishes can be a tad bit salty, but they were overall well done.  On weekends, there is almost always a wait/line but the dimsum is also served on carts then too!  The wedding dinner was fantastic, and considering the sheer number of tables there, the fact that all the food was still hot and fresh when served is really impressive.  The decor is well done - bright, clean, \"glamour\" feel. Service is excellent and the staff are extremely attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Dim Sum at a good price depending what time you go.  The reason I came to the restaurant is b/c I was told that it has one of the best dim sum in the Scarborough area, if not in the GTA. To a point the people who told me were partially right. Maybe in the Scaborough area but not in the GTA.  Considering alot of people had given me alot of hype about this place I was very disappointed not necessarily with the food but more so with the decor. I feel that when going to a place to eat 20% of the experience should come from what you see, decoration, colour cleanliness etc . I was expecting a very well decorated place with lots of lively colours however the colours were very bland and very depressing.  The tables and chairs were drapped with cloth but nothing that would catch you're eye. The place was clean however right down to the floors and even the bathrooms.  The staff were very friendly especially the one guy who I believe was the one in charge at that time. He was very prompt, friendly, good at making  conversation, and gave us a a tip on not to double up on the dim sum. I was curious as to why he said that but I would soon find out.  The reason he told us not to double up was b/c the dim sum is huge! I usually double up my orders on some of my favourite dim sum items b/c it's never enough for me and my friends and family. But just one piece of let say, shu mai, was equal to two pieces anywhere else. Which was great b/c I was full and it didn't cost me as much! As well the filling is jam packed, lets take for instance, har gow. In most places you have a tiny filling that moves around easily if you were to shake it. At this place the filling doesnt move b/c its that jam packed.   The best time and days to go to this place would be monday thru friday from 1430hrs - 1600hrs. The reason being is b/c theres no one there and the dim sum prices are alot cheaper. If you go during the weekend, good luck getting a table and any service b/c it is rammed! Mind you that's really any dim sum place in the GTA on a weekend.  I would definetly come back here but only if I happen to be in the area and craving dim sum at that time.  Items to definetly get  - DIM SUM!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for my Aunt's birthday dinner, contrary to our typical Cantonese banquet-style dinners at Crown Prince. I like the feel of this place, Crown Prince's atmosphere is stuffier, while it's a bit busier and more commonplace at DD - kind of like typical HK banquet restaurants.   Like all Cantonese dinners, it's family style, so we had a few large dishes: crab, steamed fish, stir fried steak bits, sweet and spicy eel on a small tortilla, and stir fried bok choy. Everything was okay, but the eel deserves special mention because of the crispy tortilla chip texture + the sweet and spiciness of the eel itself. The food here is a bit oilier than Crown Prince, but hey, fat is flavour right? The customary Chinese pastries and sweet soup (Tong Sui) were a little disappointing though. The Walnut sweet soup was way too sweet and the pastries were cold and dry.   Can't comment on price because I wasn't paying! But it seems comparable to places like Crown Prince.  Not a bad choice for dinner though out of a lot of Cantonese banquet restaurants I've tried."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I was little, but stopped as it was at a somewhat inconvenient location. After several years, I came back here for a New Year's Day dinner.  A few things changed that I know for sure: The interior was completely redecorated, and actually looks quite upscale now. The mall itself was also modernized to a small extent. When I was there at around 7pm, the place was surprisingly empty. In fact, it was so empty they cornered off half the restaurant, which again shocked me a bit considering this used to be a busy place.  All that aside though, the food we ordered was quite decent, and the prices were actually very low! Some items we ordered include beef tenderloin on an iron skillet, seafood in bird's nest, free range chicken with jellyfish (the jellyfish wasn't very good), a soup which I forgot (it was pork based with wonton that tasted like siu mai and tilapia fish...be careful, LOTS of bones in the fish).  Service was acceptable; at least we were attended to the whole time we were there. However it was a quiet night, so I would want to save my judgement till a busier day."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum this morning. We arrived a bit after 11 so we missed the dim sum specials. We were seated at a table in the corner. Dim sum was served with carts but there was not a lot of carts going around, plus they always started at the same spot and ended where we were so not much left. The waitresses did not say in English what she had, which other restaurants have done for me. Luckily my wife and in-laws are cantonese so they knew what was being served. After 1 hour we only had 7 dishes that we wanted and had to leave. The price was a bit expensive (40$ for 7 dishes plus tea).  As we were getting ready to leave, around 12:15, a lot more dim sum carts were coming out of the kitchen. If we do return for dim sum, we will go after 12."}
{"text":"Dragon Dynasty is one of the very few restaurants on the eastern part of North America where the dims um seems comparable to the dimsum in Hong Kong. We travelled via public transportation from downtown TO and it took us almost an hour and half. The restaurant is located inside Chartwell mall, which we didn't know so we had to look around a bit at first.  However, the mall is tiny so once you are inside, it's easy to find this place.  The wait around 11:40 was about 20 mins so it wasn't bad but we just managed to beat a big crowd... though I think we were helped by the rainy day. We got:  Baby squid in curry sauce: This was my favorite cuz the curry sauce reminded me of a sauce my mom used to make. The baby squids were cooked to perfection.   Tripe and pig skin in brown sauce:  The tripe was good but I like pig skin to be crispy so I didn't like this soft, saucy version as much   Pork Meatballs : Decent flavor   Tendons braised in soy/star anise sauce: The tendons were very soft. Usually I like a little bit of bite in my tendons but since these were large chunks, I think cooking them soft was the way to go.    Pig feet braised brown/black bean sauce: Not bad but having had some amazing pig feet a couple of days ago, I wasn't too excited by this.  Tofu skin stuffed with pork and shrimp: Excellent  Fried glutinous rice dumplings with pork: They sit on your stomach like an iron due to the heaviness of the glutinous rice but these dumplings are a must have.  Spring roll w shrimp: Not what I'd typically order for dimsum but they looked interesting and they had Japanese mayo inside. Liked them a lot even though they aren't your typical dim sum dish  Hong Kong style egg tart: Not that great. Actually, probably the only disappointment of the meal. I prefer a crust that is more buttery and flaky and an egg custard that is less sweet and more eggy.    I think if I lived close by, I would be a regular here. Scarborough has an excellent choice for dim sum in Dragon Dynasty. We'll come back here again the next time we visit Toronto. Definitely worth the long trek."}
{"text":"Probably the closest to Hong Kong standards that I have experienced.  The food is always served piping hot, the dim sum wrappers are fairly thin and refined and generally a fresh tasting experience.  The service is exceptionally good.  Always a nice treat.  Thankfully my rudimentary Cantonese helps when I order ... I would highly recommend this place, especially for their yum-cha.  When I think of some of the fancy places downtown TO which will remain nameless ... they can learn from this place as to what good customer service is ... and the way fine Cantonese food should taste like!"}
{"text":"wayyyyyy to expensive for the quality & service.   it's the traditional push-cart dim sum style, but several times that I've been here there just aren't enough carts going around and we either end up sitting around starving or we have to get up ourselves to find carts for food.   also, some of the dishes quality are just poor. see the broken ha gow in one of the pictures."}
{"text":"I see Dragon Dynasty everywhere -- in lists of top Chinese & dim sum restaurants, on a couple of those reality shows about catering weddings, and in every magazine ever, being given great reviews.  And it's great for me, because it's literally blocks away from where I grew up. It's part of a random Scarborough \"mall\", with a Price Chopper and a Shoppers that never got renovated, etc etc. Basically, everything around it is no frills.  Yet, Dragon Dynasty has such an extravagant name, and they probably used the name because they knew their food was going to be ROYAL (bad joke). But it's literally some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. Prices are on the higher end, considering you can go next door and get a styrofoam container filled to the brim for $4, but you're paying for good quality and great service here, as well as the assurance that this food will sit comfortably in your stomach.    If you can ever make it out to this area before 11am, you should definitely run over to Dragon Dynasty for dim sum. They serve enormous, delicious, skillfully-crafted dim sum -- huge rice rolls with GIANT shrimp, siu mai with pork that doesn't make you cringe, and dumplings that aren't dripping with grease. I mean, dim sum is greasy by nature, but Dragon Dynasty has some top Chinese chefs in the kitchen who know how to make great greasy food without overdoing it.  Not to mention, before 11 am, this dim sum is less than $2 a dish! Cheaper than anything you'll find downtown, far better quality, and a great dining experience."}
