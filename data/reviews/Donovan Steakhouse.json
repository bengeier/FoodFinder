{"text":"The food was very tasty and the waitress was very friendly.  I ordered a 6 oz filet with shrimp scampi.  The steak was delicious but the shrimp was way over cooked.  Baked potato was a little bland seemed like it would have been better with the butter and salt on the peeling like most places do.  Ambiance was relaxing.  Yes I would go back and try a different potato style, maybe the garlic mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Went here for a 'BIG' birthday.  The service is good, the food is meh!   I had the 6 oz filet and two bacon wrapped scallops.  He had the 10 oz filet and we ordered the mac n cheese with bacon as an extra side.  All my food except for the scallops was cold and lacked seasoning.  Tha manager came by and asked how our food was, I explained my food was cold, he said he would take it back to warm it up but I declined.  The mac n cheese was very dry and lacked flavor. I have had much better food at Felmings and The Keg - the one things Donovan's has on them is the atmosphere.  The other two places can get very loud, at Donovans you could enjoy a conversation.   I doubt I would go back.   The manager did comp a dessert but not enought to make me want to do back."}
{"text":"Bad food and bad management. We came from Los Angeles for the baseball games and will never come back again. Awful management and unprofessional service."}
