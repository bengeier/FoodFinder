{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for brunch and we will definitely be back soon. The atmosphere was casual and inviting while the service was genuine and friendly. The food was super fresh and you can tell that the it was all made to order. There are a lot of vegetarian/pescatarian options, which is one of my favorite things about this place, but there are plenty of great items for meat lovers as well.  I ordered the black bean burger with the soup of the day and she got the macaroni omelet. I didn't try any of her meal but I can tell you about mine.  The cheesy potato with vegetables soup was a great start, and could have been a meal on its own. Each bite offered new flavors of vegetables with the constant potato and cheese flavors. This soup was great in that there wasn't too much or too little cheese. I hate soup that is drowned in cheese.  Next was the black bean burger which I ordered on wheat. This is by far the best tasting bean patty I've ever had! The consistency was thick and moist similar to that of a beef patty. The sandwich also came with lettuce, tomato, pepper jack cheese, and a spicy mayo which added a very enjoyable slow burning spice to the sandwich.  TLDR: All in all, Sweet Pea is a very warm restaurant with amazing food (especially if you are a vegetarian/pescatarian). Expect quality food, friendly service, and the feeling of a very satisfied stomach when you leave. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is OK ... not great.  The service is slow and I mean slow!.  The real problem is the cleanliness ... UGH!   The bathrooms are in need of cleaning, there was someones lipstick stain on my wife's water glass the other day and we all got grossed out!   Take a look at the front door the next time you enter ... it's filthy and it looks like an animal chewed on the door jam.  The very least they can do is clean.   It makes you wonder what's going on in the kitchen. Welcome to Sweet Pea Cafe!   NOT."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But, unfortunately the bland food and terrible service kept me from doing so."}
{"text":"California omelet was spectacular.  A very homey feel."}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME. Very delicious and well put together menu. Coffee is delicious. Interior outdated and very poor, but good quality food makes up for it. They deff take their time cooking so don't except quick service either"}
{"text":"Some friends and I tried out the Sweet Pea Cafe for Sunday breakfast recently, but I doubt we'll be going back.  We were excited to try it out, as the menu looked very interesting (if overpriced) and some of the reviews were very positive.  We went early to avoid the rush and were seated in a nearly empty restaurant. We were able to study the menu extensively; no one took our order for more than 15 minutes. Our waitress seemed annoyed that she had to deal with us and was curt and dismissive. We waited another 30 minutes for our food. During this time, the waitress only stopped by the table once only to tell us that the kitchen had messed up one person's order and had to remake it. She left the table without offering refills on coffee or water.  When the food finally arrived, most of it was good. The huevos rancheros was declared spicy and delicious and the loaded oatmeal was full of good things. Unfortunately, two of our party were very disappointed in their very salty and greasy eggs benedict specials - they were a good concept, but very poorly executed.  Based on the food alone, I'd give this place another shot, but the prices and the service make it unlikely."}
{"text":"Learned that my family has been coming here ever since our previous trip.  They love the creative take on breakfast and the quality of the food.    Stopped in again today and it was every bit as delicious as last time, thus solidifying Sweet Pea as of my favorite breakfast spots, ever."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile now, and found myself in the area on a Sunday at brunch time. My husband had eaten there for lunch and enjoyed it, so we thought we'd give brunch a try. This review is for service only, since we never made it to actually eating there. We arrived and found a line of maybe 5-6 parties ahead of us, with the line stretching to the door. To get out of the doorway, we shuffled toward the counter and tried to stay out of the way, assuming a host would be around to take our name. After 10 minutes or so, no one approached us to ask our name, so my husband went to the counter to see if there was a list of parties waiting. He was told that there was, so he added our name to the list. Another 5-10 minutes passed, and a server approached us and asked \"have you been waiting the longest?\" we replied no, so he worked his way down the line until he found a party that said that they had been waiting the longest. Another few minutes passed, and another staff member started down the line of waiting patrons, asking everyone to add their name to the list she had. We told her that we already added our name with someone at the counter, she looked at the list and said \"I have a John, party of 2\" and we said \"that's us.\" She then said, \"no, there must be two 'John, party of two's,'\" and added our name to the bottom of the newly expanded list. It was very strange. Just a few minutes later, a couple came in the door, approached the server with the clipboard and asked to be squeezed in because \"we only need a table for two.\" Well, this couple was seated immediately, before us and at least 2 other couples who had been waiting longer. At that point, we were disgusted with the disorganized service and left to find brunch elsewhere. We really would not have minded the amount of time we waited, if it looked like we would be seated in some semblance of order based on when we arrived. But, there were at least 4 different methods employed to seat customers. Names taken at the counter, a roving host taking names from the line directly, the honor system, where servers just ask customers to who is next, and then apparently just asking nicely and hoping to jump the line. The management just needs to pick one method and stick with it! We're sorry we didn't get to try the food. Maybe when the management works out a little more efficient system, we'll give them another try. Waiting 25 minutes to see a random assortment of people get seated in no particular order was not the experience we were hoping for."}
{"text":"I travel from cleveland at least once a month just for the varity on the menu if your not in a rush to get some where and have time to kill stop up at the pea and have a great meal"}
{"text":"Still my go-to place for pre-2:00 PM meals. The vegan sausage is really flavorful, and makes the vegan breakfast sandwich such a good option. I had the macaroni for the first time, and was surprised to see that it came not just with eggplant mixed in, but topped with a beautiful sautée of spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and zucchini, and baked with a cheese and breadcrumb crust. Delicious. I've also never had the bad service other reviews mention. I've only been on weekdays, so maybe it's a weekend thing?  The also just added Belly, a rewards card program."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here for the first time.  He had the mac 'n cheese omelette (with chorizo); I had the Western benedict.  Staff is delightful, portions generous, food quite tasty.  The menu is varied, it was hard to decide what to order.  We will be back - new brunch favorite!!"}
{"text":"50 minutes to get two omelet breakfasts. Our toast came out after our breakfast was delivered. At one point during our waiting I pointed out to the server our food was taking 45 minutes and her response was \"have you read our reviews online?\" As we were eating a cook came out to the dining room to point out to each guest things were taking a long time (as if we didn't know), but my thought was why isn't he in the kitchen catching up or cooking? At no point during our time at the Sweet Pea was there as line and only when we first arrived was it full, at all other times there were open tables. Between the service, wait time, no sense of urgency from the mingling cook, and mediocre quality of the food, we won't be back. I wasn't looking for the world's greatest meal, just as decent brunch."}
{"text":"I confess. I'm a foodie. And Sweet Pea Cafe fans the flame.  The food is consistently good. The service is .... getting there (the last two visits have been surprising - good!).  My first dish here was the Texas Omelette - it has all my faves: jalapenos, cheese, chorizo. When I like something, I LIKE it. And nowhere else serves this dish, so it's been my \"regular\" order.  My latest visit I ordered something new: the veggie breakfast sandwich: fresh spinach, garden sausage, fresh tomato on English muffin) WOWOWOW! And my husband ordered Floatmeal. WHOA! Awesome!!! (yes, three exclamation points awesome). And the pretty side dish of fresh fruit is a bonus.  I love this place."}
{"text":"A good place to eat for brunch. Service was the only thing that we did not enjoy. Slow getting meals and a forgetful waitress that never did bring us several items after we asked for them repeatedly. Otherwise the food was decent."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this place.  Explanation:  My husband and I have visited this restaurant about 8 times in the last couple of years.  We have eaten out a lot throughout the US for every meal, as we both have had jobs that involve frequent travel for many years.  So we do have a good reference for what constitutes quality food and service. And cooking is my hobby, so I understand what goes into preparing good food.  The first 3 times we went there, we liked it a lot and loved coming back.  Not anymore.  Bottom line:  food is OK but overpriced, unless they are using only organic ingredients, which they are not.  They are understaffed to the point that even if you go when it's not busy, you really wait a long time to get your meal served.  And it is clear that the two people who were on the waitstaff when we were last there cared not one whit about the customers.  Yes, I understand that it's the owner's fault that they are understaffed.  But when I pointed out the uncaring and slow service to one of the two young people who comprised the waitstaff that day, he reacted with incredible hostility, insisting that no other restaurant in our area provides the same fresh breakfast that Sweet Pea does, and that was the reason why making and serving the food takes so long. If that is so, then why did Sweet Pea manage to get the food out in a timely manner on our first 3 visits?  Then he walked off in a huff, giving me a nasty look,  saying he had other people to serve instead of talking to me. Which was interesting because previously he had seemed so unconcerned about the customers.   I have a message for the owner of Sweet Pea:  there are several restaurants around here that provide excellent service with excellent fresh ingredients.  And I know where they are.  Also, omelets and pancakes do not take a half hour or more to make.  Especially when your restaurant is not busy. And ignoring customers and serving burnt coffee is just laziness.  There is much more but I just wish to cover the main points. We finally just got up, paid for our coffee, walked out, and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food and service are good but the wait for food has been incredibly long both times I have been here. Don't go in starving after church."}
{"text":"The food here is seriously great. Interesting and creative and great. Any day of the week, order the special. Whatever it is that day I promise you will be pleased.  I do think the place got off to a rocky start in terms of service, but I think they have a handle on it now. The only reason I have to knock off a star is because the atmosphere is kinda lousy. I want to feel proud bringing my friends here, but instead I'm like, \"Pay no attention to the boring decor, the food is good.\" After all this time, I feel they should be able to remedy the look of the place by now.  But let's end this review on a high note: THE FOOD. It's so yummy. Go on a cold morning, order a hot chocolate and anything \"Benedict,\" and prepare to be dazzled."}
{"text":"We visited here with our family from out of town - who found this on Yelp! We love the Sweet Pea! It is our new Sunday breakfast joint. Omelets are delicious. Everything from a corn and bacon pancake (yes! and it's fantastic) to a Mac N Cheese Omelet w/ chorizo & carmelized onions is delicious. Service has been getting better each time we have gone."}
{"text":"They were able to accommodate our party of 9 on a Sunday which was great.  The food was good and the servers were on top of things (coffee refills etc), but the kitchen was SO SLOW.  It's as if one cook didn't show up that morning.  They really needed more cooks to keep up.  When looking around at the tables, most didn't have food on them, suggesting everyone's food was slow coming out."}
{"text":"I went there today after a long run and had the most incredible sandwich.  it was the A(vacado), C(heese), E(gg) BLT on rye.  It was fantastic.    I can't recommend this place enough. Love it."}
{"text":"The Sweet Pea is our favorite lunch spot.  We have often visited multiple times a week in the past couple of years.  We love their excellent variety of breakfasts, salads and sandwiches which are always a \"cut above\" with special twists to surprise and delight.  Our favorites are the California Omelet, the Caprese Eggs Benedict, and Chorizo breakfast bowls.  The owner and chef, Josh, often comes out to welcome his patrons like they are returning house guests.  Carol is a delightful and friendly down-home kind of server.  We feel like she is serving us at her kitchen table.  The Sweet Pea also allows for personal differences without penalizing you, substitutions are always fine and the prices are always right.  We can't say enough positive about our beloved Sweet Pea!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast!  The food is always good and my coffee cup is always full. The atmosphere is quaint and relaxing. My favorite breakfast place around!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!  Huge pancakes, perfect cooked to order eggs, great bacon...  Coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Food is great and SO many vegetarian choices! They also have some alcohol, which makes it a great hair of the dog breakfast place!   Some Friday nights they have bands come in...have yet to experience this, but seems like it could be pretty cool.   The hipster servers are usually somewhat hungover, which can make for a really fun or super annoying morning - depending on your mood."}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast.  Food was excellent and they had a huge selection of hot sauces.  Two small drawbacks that kept it from a higher rating, decor...looks like a 80's family restaurant and the amount of time it took get our breakfast.  That may be due to everything being made from scratch.  Overall enjoyable meal and definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I ate at Sweet Pea's with three other friends on a Sunday around 12. Overall, I can't say enough good things about the food! It was all well prepared, fairly cheap and definitely seemed like it was all made from scratch. I ordered the eggs bene, my girlfriend got the southwestern scramble, and our two friends got a breakfast sandwich and pancakes. Not only did I enjoy their food, I really liked their menu as well in that it included a few dishes that you wouldn't typically see on a breakfast menu like a breakfast quiche. They also have a good vegetarian menu if you're a vegetarian. In terms of service, our waitress was friendly, attentive and our drinks were always full. The only negative I came across is that the food took a while to come out and we had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table, which I attribute the food to being made from scratch and the wait to it being a slightly older, after church crowd that lingered a bit after their meal. I'd definitely recommend Sweet Pea's to anyone looking for a great, homecooked breakfast at a very affordable price! I'll defnitely be back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast cooks in the Akron area! There is something for everyone and a diverse crowd. I like the local vibe and the cooky waiters. Get the special! It's always my favorite!"}
{"text":"Good veggie options. Family owned. The owner Puts a lot of soul into the place. Great for lunch. Dinner menu supposed to be coming soon but uncertain if this place can pass as an evening 'restaurant'"}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood local spot. Nothing mind-blowing, but the service was fine, the food was ok, and the atmosphere was cute midwestern diner. I had the meat quiche of the day, which was fine. Dad had French toast which was really good but nothing too out of control. The prices are great. The food took too long to come out. The menu/selection wa great. I had a really hard time deciding what to get. I saw some omelettes go by that looked really good. The lady next to me (we sat at the bar) got a BLT that looked ok but had about a half head of iceburg on it. If I came back again I'd order something different. I doubt I'll ever be in Fairlawn OH again but I think I'd give Sweet Pea another try. I like avoiding the big chains when possible."}
{"text":"Our first time at Sweet Pea Cafe. I got a lemon ricotta pancake with a side of bacon. The pancake was the most moist and flavorful pancake I've ever had. The lemon curd on top was sweet enough that I didn't need syrup.   Service was quick and accurate. The decor could use an update, but hey I'm here for the food. The cafe was busy with most tables filled on this Sunday morning."}
{"text":"We had the Hotta Frittata and Eggs Breakfast. Both were delicious! Service was fine on a Sunday at 10:30. Atmosphere could use some updating, but the restaurant was clean so I was happy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a road trip from NJ to Chicago (just a few minutes off I-80).  The coffee was really tasty.  The decor was quaint, a bunch of random (amateur) paintings all over the walls, I liked the feel.  You must try the mac and cheese omelet.  It was so good!  My boyfriend had the corn and bacon pancakes, he ordered 2 and they were way too much for him (I didn't really care for them, I think the corn was too sweet or something).  Overall very good, cute cafe stop for our trip!"}
{"text":"Nice live acoustic music on the wknds. Beer & wine. Ambiance leaves a little to be desired.   Great breakfast place. Same ambiance (stark)."}
{"text":"Eh, mediocre.  The decor is spartan (almost college dorm-like).  Had a standard breakfast of eggs, muffin, bacon and potatoes.  Nothing standout.  Eggs were swimming in butter.  Potatoes were undercooked and underseasoned.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I had a huge veggie omelet with avocado and basil--amazing. My friend got teh GIANT pancake and it was delicious too. Great service, loved the atmosphere. Never would have found it at it's odd location tho, without finding it on yelp actually. LOVE"}
{"text":"Girls Saturday breakfast we thought we would try this place.  It was fairly busy although we were seated right away.  That was the best part of the experience as we waited 10 minutes to get our coffee and asked several times for silverware.  15 minutes in, we finally placed our order no deviations from the menu and waited 45 minutes to finally get our meal by this time semi warm.  Refills for coffee were far and few between. The waitress\"es\" attire were unbelievable as another person posted.  Super tight dresses and the aprons were longer than the dress.  The food was decent tasting but not worth the wait.  If you do venture into this place DO NOT sit back by the bathrooms the smell was  very unappetizing.        A decently trained staff would make a big difference in this place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for Akronites looking for breakfast.  The best things on the menu are the lemon ricotta pancake and the mac n' cheese omelet. The food is fresh, the staff is nice, and the menu is bountiful.  I wish this place was open all day, but I definitely believe this is the best place for breakfast.  The only thing I would change is the amount fo cheese they put on the fritatas, but it's not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem of Fairlawn, Ohio! Stop in for their breakfast and/or lunch, or even for the new dinner menu exclusive to Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.   Everything on both menus looks, sounds and even tastes the best around. And homemade from scratch! Fair prices and an awesome and fun staff as well.  Tonight I ordered the house hummus and enjoyed a really talented local musician, Dave Hammer. Check this place out! You'll leave satisfied and without regret, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner on a Thursday night. Busy but not slow or crowded feeling. Great atmosphere, not too bright or dim. Perfect diner. New favorite restaurant in Akron/Fairlawn. Clean fresh food with some creatively thoughtful twists and imported ideas. Amazing friendly staff. Best I've eaten at in Akron area and very affordable."}
{"text":"The reviews for Sweet Pea Cafe we a bit  exaggerated.  It's not exceptional is decor or cuisine but it was a nice place for an average, could-have-made-it-myself breakfast. On our most recent visit the service was HORRIFIC, waiting over 45 minutes to have a breakfast order taken but this was the first time it happened so the review is not based on the service, rather the mediocre food."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Sweet Pea Cafe is mediocre at best. The atmosphere is not the greatest. The decor is sparse and the overall feel of the restaurant is lacking. The food was just OK and the prices were high for what you get. Certainly not a place I would return to or recommend."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with a simple yet very good menu!  Great vibe, good cup of coffee and sweet people serving!!  It will always be a stop when in Akron!"}
{"text":"Oh you know, just out trying another new breakfast place ;)   Sweet Pea was not at all what I was expecting. In my mind I envisioned this small cafe, full of charm, the smell of great breakfast and maybe a Cheers like atmosphere. Instead it was a large space with no personality or charm. It really seems they found a big enough space and bought some tables and chairs and figured, \"good enough!\"  BUT, sometimes the most lackluster places are the ones that blow you away.  Sadly, not Sweet Pea.   First, the staff is at their own pace- SLOW. Forever to get acknowledged, to get food, to get a bill, etc. In fact, after our waitress cleared out plates it took 15 minutes to get a bill. She was standing at the counter texting. So if you're in a hurry this isn't your place.   Food, I really don't remember, HA! I mean, I didn't have to get it remade but it also doesn't stand out in my memory of wowing me."}
{"text":"I checked out Sweet Pea Cafe in spite of the very mixed reviews.  Here's what I think:  1. Ambiance / Decore of place sucks.  I walked in and thought, \"Am I in the right place?  Are they open?  What's wrong with the lights?  Are they under construction.\"  Obviously they've not put their restaurant dollars into fixing up the place.  Don't worry about this or come here if you're looking for aesthetic.  You're not going to get it. What you will get is a clean table to eat at.  Fine with me. 2. Menu.   I wanted to try so many items on the menu.  They offer breakfast and lunch.  I couldn't make up my mind and I had plenty of time to decide because I was waiting to meet a friend.  I opted for the special of a version of eggs Benedict with avocado and tomato on it.  There was something sort of spicy in the mix and all in all it was a great combination of flavors.  The coffee was not too bad and our waitress kept us suitably caffeinated. 3. Service SLOW.  I repeat, do not go here if you're in a hurry.  Items are made-to-order.  That's right, it means I can pick & choose what I want on my plate and they'll do it for me.  It also means that meals take time.  While I didn't mind the wait because I was catching up with an old friend, I might have otherwise been irritable about the amount of time it took for my food.   All in all, I was happy with the service and the food.  There are definitively execution issues and they have work to do, but I would return to this place.  I think they offer something that you're not going to get anywhere else in the area.  Check it out (as long as you're not in a rush)."}
{"text":"Fabulous Food, Great Service, and the prices were very reasonable. Will definitely eat here again on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict I have had! The staff were very very nice. The service was quick. I think I found my new breakfast place! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Sweet Pea Cafe is a great breakfast/lunch spot.  The food is excellent, menu is varied, staff is friendly.  The specials are always a good bet!  There are also delicious dinners on the 2nd Saturday of each month (by reservation only).  A new restaurant definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was slow, but sweet.  Had to return my omelette as it was cooked wrong.  Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday morning with my girlfriends for Galentine's Day brunch. If you're not familiar, Galentine's Day is just for the girls on or around Valentine's Day.  When you first walk in, there's a sign on the counter that tells you to seat yourself. We were promptly approached by our waitress and asked what we wanted to drink. Some ordered coffee, some ordered hot tea. I like that the hot drinks were served in clear glass mugs. You can see the cream swirl in with the coffee.   There are a lot of choices on the menu. I narrowed it down to the Ohio omelet which comes with bacon, cheese, corn, and onions in it and a side of potatoes. It was pretty tasty but was lacking seasoning. The potatoes were especially bland and were cooked with large chunks of jalapeno which were still raw and were spicy! I thought it was green bell pepper so I ate one and was terribly surprised that it was jalapeno. I like jalapeno when it's cooked down and the bitter heat is cooked out. Also, it seemed to take a very long time to receive our meals. They weren't ridiculously busy or anything so I'm not sure why the wait was so long.   As I was eating, my hot tea was getting low and it also took quite a long time before our waitress came back to see if we needed anything. She did eventually refill our hot teas but by then I was just about done eating.   Overall, it was a decent experience made better because my friends were there. While the food is unique and tasty, the service is slow and leaves much to be desired. I might have to give them another shot in the future because there were some other dishes on the menu that I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Many of the rough edges have been smoothed, so up from two to four stars.  I am always impressed with the food quality, the invention of the menu and the freshness.  Bravo!  When all three generations are thrilled with a meal, I know the rest of the day will progress with nary a bump.  (I've re-visited my harsh treatment of the languid serving times.  I feel better now.  I feel... happy!)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, horrible service!!! I've been coming here since they opened and have always had a good experience, but this morning was horrible. We waited 45 min for food and when it came out it was cold. The place was busy but none of the tables were cleared."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new breakfast place, a change from the ever-present chain restaurants. The menu is diverse,  with some interesting twists on the standards. My meal was the egg breakfast, which had potatoes and wheat toast - it was very good.   The waitress was very pleasant, and the owner stopped by to check on the diners. As for décor, it was very nice and clean, and perhaps it has been redone since some other reviewers visited this establishment.  Overall, a very good meal at a fair price, and good service, too."}
{"text":"The Sweet Pea has been nicely updated with new interior that is much more inviting. A new menu (the food has always been good) and much better service make this a great place to come."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Sweet Pea Cafe twice now. I had breakfast both times. The first time I had blueberry pancakes and sausage. They were both good. I also tried some of the cherry chocolate pancakes, something unique. The chocolate is in the batter and makes for an interesting taste.  The second time I got Justin's Special Omelet (or something like that.) It is an omelet with macaroni and cheese, chorizo, and vegetables in it. It got my attention because it sounded strange but it was real good. The chorizo helps tie everything together. I'll have to get it again and watch for other creative things like this.  The service was friendly and the speed was OK. I'll be going back again and recommending the restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Told me it would take 15 min for a salad with chicken. Went over 15 min later to find a very unwelcoming staff, empty resturant, and food not finished. Upon paying and waiting an additional 10 minutes, I had to return to work next door as I could not keep my guests waiting and told the server to bring the food to me. She did a short time later with a note telling me to be more patient. I returned the food and asked for a refund for fear something had been done to the food. The servers told me I should've expected my food to take forever... Seriously?? I expect you to let me know if my food is going to take longer than originally anticipated."}
{"text":"Not my favorite restaurant but the food is ok. Last time I went there I ordered eggs Benedict with bacon and an English muffin. I tasted good. The wait was very long which was kind of confusing because not that many people were there. The server was helpful and very sweet. I will go back but I will not order the same thing"}
{"text":"Although the restaurant itself could use some sprucing up on the inside, I was so impressed by my experience at this hidden gem, that it gets all five of my stars.    Hanne was our darling waitress, and was as capable as she was cute.  I brought two teenage gals with me for lunch and she was sweet to compliment them and make them two very happy mugs of hot chocolate.  We ordered an assortment of food from the granola-yogurt parfait to the grilled chicken sandwich (with an aioli I want to eat by the spoonful).  The menu was cleverly written and offered a generous variety of items.  Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Coffee is awesome.  Ordered the Texas omelet it was good. Friendly waitress. No negative comments. But probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here again. Nothing really special but it was good."}
{"text":"Not fancy decor-wise, but the service was great, it wasn't overly crowded and there were VEGETARIAN options. Hurrah! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the pancake with ham.  The pancake was huge, but very heavy.  Service was slow, but there's only one waitress, so she has to take care of everything.  Even though they are close to home, I won't be back.  Also the place needs a good cleaning.  I was afraid to touch the door.  We have eaten breakfast in many Northeast Ohio locations, both chains and independent locations.  Some of the reviews said they make the pancake batter from scratch every day.  Time for another recipe for the pancakes or get some Aunt Jemima mix at Giant Eagle or Acme.  Usually we go to Perkins once a week and the pancakes are always light and fluffy.  A pancake that covers the plate doesn't impress me if it doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've had an omelette and have not had to add any condiments.. to anything for that matter. The potatoes were awesome too. The whole meal was terrific, wait staff was courteous and helpful. Thank you, we will be back again!"}
{"text":"I coundn't recall why it had been so long since we went to sweet pea.  Now I know why. The service seemed better.  for example... someone noticed when we were waiting for a table. Its just so dssappointing because even though the food is good,  This place is just too dirty for me to go to.  I cant get passed it.   I wish I could.  I wont be going back.  It seems that other people feel the same."}
{"text":"Although we did have to wait for service both to order and for our bill, the food was absolutely outstanding! I had the California omelet with a side of bacon. I always order my bacon extra crisp and often have to send it back, but not here! It was excellent. My husband's over medium eggs were similarly cooked perfectly and my omelet was full to bursting with fresh ingredients. We will be back."}
{"text":"Five stars-why not. There just wasn't anything to complain about. Nice little different twist on every dish. Service was prompt and friendly. I had the mac n cheese omelette. It was great with the sour dough toast. Taters had a real nice flavor.  One of the best local joints around. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ok I normally don't post anything negative bc I just don't like negativity but this place wasn't a wonderful experience. The \"food runner\" man, was the most friendly social person there. You don't get greeted. No one even acknowledges you. Apparently you seat yourself. We noticed the small sign in the back corner later. And they have zero sense of urgency. They take their time and don't care at all. It's the slowest breakfast service I've gotten. They do have corn tortillas for those that are gluten free. And vegetarian options so that's awesome. The food tastes good so that's obviously a positive. Maybe not the best proportions but for the price, it works. And then again you don't want to eat till your full anyways so it's ok. I don't know if I would try back or not but definitely don't go there if you have to be  somewhere within the hour."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and support local businesses but the quality of the food & service are always inconsistent. For starters, as you arrive, no one acknowledges you so you don't whether to wait to be seated or sit wherever you want. We've been here a few times and the food always takes a long time to arrive. Unfortunately, ours was cold today when it got to the table. It didn't help that the place was cold & everyone in the establishment had to keep their coats on This place has a lot of potential & people seem to like it but I struggle to come back if it continues to fall short on some many things. The service was fine but everyone should to make an effort to make this place shine."}
{"text":"Friendly hard working staff. Seats you quickly. Food is so good. Not thrilled about the coffee but the breakfast was very good.   Clean bathrooms, dining area and a bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice friendly local diner in the heart of the chains which I avoid.  Food and service is great.  I always get the two egg breakfast.  The potatoes and wheat toast are awesome!"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast and sat outside during the warm summer days. I had the parfait which was fine. Nothing special, but not offensive. The service was descent. The second time we went we sat inside. Upon entering I realized it was a dive. The counter, chairs & tables, & decorations were decrepit, dirty, and grungy. Against our better judgement we decided to stay & eat. I ordered the omelette w spinach & cheese with potatoes. And what came out were crispy eggs with soggy onions & tomatoes covered with cheddar cheese & boiled potatoes. It was inedible. The others ordered the california omelet which was also flat omelet that was folded over cold avocado, tomatoes, and jack cheese (unmelted shredded cheese!). It was disgusting. To make matters worse, when I walked into the restroom it was so dirty that I left without using the facilities! Never going back there. I don't even want to imagine how dirty the kitchen is."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch based on Yelp's reviews.  We were not disappointed.  The food was excellent, the dining area clean and the server was attentive.  The most surprising part of our meal was the Macaroni and Cheese Omelet.  It was amazing, like nothing I have ever eaten before."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Mac and cheese omelet was delicious. The mac was great and the eggs for the folded omelet were cooked perfectly.  The veggies inside were great not a watery mess and the chorizo in it was the perfect addition  carmelized onions also delish!!!  Sounds like a lot but it all worked beautifully and wasnt soaked in that yellow oil goo that most griddle cooks use  Came with good potatoes and an excellent fresh fruit cup too all for $8. Great service. My friends meals looked awesome too. Breakfast sanwich with great veggie sausage. And the house granola even looked awesome when I thought it would be a snooze.   I think they should paint the place Terra cotta to brighten it up. The wonderful food needs a slightly more beautiful home. Not that bland decor would keep me away  it was still a comfortable space.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was very slow.  We often had to repeat our order while the waitress was writing it down, and we were still brought the wrong food.  My vegetarian sister was given an omelet with bacon on it.  We had a two year old with us so we can't really work with slow service."}
{"text":"I ordered the black bean veggie burger, my son ordered the Northern Scrambled eggs minus the cheese and my daughter got the California omelette and everything is just wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Nice fresh salad, excellent coffee, pleasant atmosphere!  Great break from the chains, yet, close to shopping."}
{"text":"Ate hear with Family today, and I must agree with previous reviews regarding slow service.  From the time we ordered it was about an hour and fifteen minutes before we received our breakfast.  Eventually I had to politely flag down our server to find if our order was in the works or not.  The owner, making rounds outside the kitchen, blamed the delay on \"everyone showing up at once\" --after church on Sunday, but by then half the place was empty and they still weren't catching up.  Even so, if you are that behind in the kitchen--- the cooks shouldn't be making rounds out front.  All this said, the San Francisco eggs Benedict were very good and well done and the Lemon Ricotta pancakes were excellent.  One omelette in the group was way overcooked/burned, but by then we were starved."}
{"text":"This was our first experience with the Sweet Pea cafe... There will not be a second one. Menus were disgusting, filthy, stains all over them. The waitress was less than pleasant. Coming to our table 3 times total; once to get our order, once to deliver our food, and once to take our check. Never checked on us one time, the cook assisted in bringing out the food and he is the only reason I got a refill at all on my drink. My fiancé went the entire breakfast without a refill. The omelet I had was good and the potatoes were good but nothing was great. I ordered a pancake and the bottom side was completely burnt. We ordered 2 normal breakfasts, 1 drink, and a side pancake and it put us back 30 dollars. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Not sure if the people who enjoyed their meals went to the same place I did. I've been there a couple times... And have never had good service or food. I still think Eye Opener had the best food."}
{"text":"Went again recently on a weekend again. Don't stop here when you're in a rush. They move at their own pace, and there are no 100 yard dashers in the crew!!   And even when the waitress asks if you want ketchup and/or hot sauce, don't rely on her word that it's on the way.  The dishes on the empty table may be calling to her to come whisk them away.....second thought maybe it's the tips that are being whisked away.  Much better to grab the already left tip than earn the next? I'll hold at three stars, but not because I'm a fan of their pacing!"}
{"text":"Technically, 3.5 stars which I will explain...   We travelled to Canton for the Football HOF induction ceremony and ended up lodging in Akron on a Sat. Night. Needless to say, we found this place on Yelp and Urban Spoon and decided to give it a shot based on both meat and vegetarian menu options, as we were a mixed bunch.    Upon arrival, we opted to sit outside on an absolutely beautiful August day - 75 degrees and a light breeze. This started a trend among the locals who I guess had been too accustomed to the raging heat to try this strategy.  We were greeted within 5 minutes, promptly given water  (we brought espresso with us from Nervous Dog Coffee- see separate review).  It became evident that Sweet Pea catered to both Omni and Herbi, and therefore all were happy. I ordered the veggie frittata, which arrived some 20 minutes later with sourdough toast, and homefried potatoes. The frittata was HUGE and fluffy, loaded with veggies and extremely tasty.  The potatoes were OK as far as breakfast potatoes go, but a bit underdone with not enough spices/onions/peppers, etc. Toast was perfect and delish.  The reason for 3.5 instead of 4 stars was the service. Either they were just in the weeds, or they were understaffed - but at Sunday brunch rush hour, better planning was needed and reflected poorly on the management.  Overall, very slow service, lack of utensils without asking for them, no offers of water refills etc., but pretty good food. As a vegetarian, I also enjoyed the various veggie options on the menu - including veggie sausage!  Give this place a try if you are in town - it certainly beats a greasy Denny's, Shoney's or the like."}
{"text":"We tried this place out a few months ago,  hopeful for finding a favorite breakfast joint.  The inside is cute,  with funny sayings framed all over the restaurant.  Everyone was nice for the most part,  but we really felt neglected. Our server seemed to be second the whole restaurant, but there were 3 other servers too who didn't seem to be doing as much.  So we rarely saw him.   My order of pancakes was giant, unexpectedly so. And sadly, tasted like they came from a krusteaz mix. Not my favorite,  but I can try to overlook it. However,  I was nearly finished with my giant pancakes,  when I noticed a curly little hair (that could not have been mine as I have stick straight hair) sandwiched between the pancakes. By this time,  we were done.  It took forever to get our check and leave and was overall a frustrating experience.   I can forgive poor service,  especially at breakfast if the food is good, but the food was just not that good.   Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"Good food but it ends there! Slow really extremely slow for food. Hello hour to get your food. Let's talk filthy! You don't even want to touch the front door. They haven't cleaned it in years! You say something to the owner and he walks away!"}
{"text":"Funny sweet quotes on the walls and good food.  Who could ask for more?  If you have not yet discovered this charming restaurant you ARE missing out!"}
{"text":"My wife found this place and thought it would be a good stop for breakfast during a weekend trip that brought us to the Akron area. I wish I could say we enjoyed our meal -- the food at the tables around us looked and smelled fabulous -- but we waited for 45 minutes after placing our order and no food ever arrived. To make matters worse, the owner seemed indifferent when we explained how long we had been waiting. I had high hopes for this place, but now I'll never know -- because we're not going back."}
{"text":"M. One word sums it up; neglect.  A serious lack of care and urgency has to come back on the owner. The food was overcooked and the service was as dry as the meal. The place had the smell of restaurant death or maybe that was it's grease traps. If success breads success than neglect must be the same also. We really go in looking for something positive to write and justify the expense of eating out, our search continues. I hope our bank account can hold out long enough.  D. Yeah I have to go along with M on the lack of upkeep.  Mail, empty card board boxes, stuff stacked up behind the counter.  The kitchen looked unorganized and messy. The cook and server were polite. The coffee was weak,  I ordered my usual, 2 eggs over very easy, potatoes, sausage (links is all they offer), rye toast; came to $10.50. The eggs were over cooked more like over medium+, sausage was hard and dry, rye toast was coated end to end which was good, but it lacked any butter flavor and the rye flavor was very mild. My potatoes tasted fine.  The biggest portion on my plate was the toast."}
{"text":"Ain't nothin' not to like about this place.  Food is creative and interesting,  Good quality.  A rare find in a \"sea of mediocrity.\"  Note:  If you an \"applebees kind of person\" you may not like this place -- no plastic or microwaved food here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Really. The atmosphere is super casual and our waitress was sweet. The bad news: we waited over an hour for our food and it was cold. There were 6 of us so I can appreciate it was a lot for one table but multiple items were forgotten (and several times) and we had to ask for our checks probably 5 times. We had an appointment to make and I had to call to push it back twice because we waited so long. I cannot (and will not) recommend this place to anyone due to the wait and cold food. Our waitress was a lovely girl and was very sweet. Additional wait staff is needed."}
{"text":"Don't go!! Worst service I've ever had. Waited 45 min and hubby's food was cold and I was still waiting for mine. It wasn't even busy!!"}
{"text":"Went here today for breakfast with two friends! As other reviewers have said, the decor is plain and nothing special. The drywall was wearing away on the wall next to our table, but I thought the original artworks for sale were nice. If you go early in the morning on a weekday, there is no wait. I thought the food came rather quickly for being homemade. I ordered the banana pancake after finding out they were out of the berry compote for the French toast. My pancake was amazing - as big as a dinner plate and at least an inch thick - and I ordered sausage links too, which were okay. Overall, a great breakfast in a laid back place. I'd like to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"We decided to try a new breakfast place today.  When we first got there no one greeted us or even acknowledged we were there.  We had to go up to a waitress to get a table.  Weren't sure though if this was a \"seat yourself operation\".  The service was slow.  The people were friendly, but they took their time between everything.  The place was not busy or crowded.  The restaurant atmosphere was weird.  Sort of reminded us of a small office.  My glass of water tasted like they got it from the toilet.  The coffee was good.  The food choices were plentiful and interesting, but unfortunately the actual food was not good.  My wife's omelette tasted ok, however my omelette must have been a barely reheated leftover.  My omelette was practically shivering!  The toast that came with our meals had some sort of tasteless \"butter\" on it.  The potatoes were good.  The floor was disgusting.  There were scraps of food all over.  We will certainly not be returning to this establishment."}
