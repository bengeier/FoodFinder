{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THE BOOTHS, the staffs will barely see you and service is a lot slower. I made that mistake twice and during both times it was obvious that we were less paid attention to. 

I would give two stars total due to the short staff but they deserve a three-star rating because the sushi and other pieces they offer are cheaper than what other Japanese restaurants offer. The taste isn't bad for what you pay.

Their rice isn't sticky enough, rather it is dry (they will crumble as you try to pick up pieces) or it will be too hard (that it takes a little effort to separate the rice into mouthfuls).

Personally I think this place is worth it if you order a takeout (and most will do that)."}
{"text":"Ordered tuna rolls and dragon rolls and was pretty disappointed :( They changed owners and it was noticeable. Neither roll was tasty."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city! I have been a customer of this restaurant for three years and I am in love with their sushi. Over this period of time I have tried almost all of their menu and I have zeroed my four favourite rolls, the black dragon roll, dynamite roll, Philadelphia roll , and smoked salmon roll. But overall all of their sushi are very high quality and delicious.I strongly recommend! 
Only observation is the service, the waiters are always running around and unless you push the button next to the table to call then, they will take a while to come take your order, bring you the bill, etc.
I recommended to look at the menu beforehand so you can order before they go run around the place, and take your bill and go pay at the front desk.
In spite of this, the sushi is worth it, believe me."}
{"text":"This place is great. I am a student at the high achool across from them and I go here every day for lunch. They have student discounts and prepare the food very fast. When I work during the weekend, they are extremely nive to my bosses and I, their Jumbo Roll and Yaki Udon are the beat I have tried, including at 168 Sushi on Steeles Ave."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic rolls! Generous portions, perfect rice, and very fresh. Very reasonable.  We had take out, and service was speedy and friendly. My new fav place."}
{"text":"Went there the first time with my family and had a decent experience.  We ordered a udon noodle soup for my tot, which she loved.  The grown-ups noted that the broth was strangely sweet.  But overall it was a good experience.  Service was prompt and attentive - Both waitresses kept our tea and waters constantly topped up and were extremely friendly and genuinely interested in chit-chatting and keeping my daughter in giggles.  

I went back solo dinner after work and the service was equally attentive....to the point of the waitress staring at me while I perused the menu.  Everything went nicely until I had to spit out a mouthful of fish scales.  Not a single stray scale, but a MOUTHFUL of large, shiny, crunchy scales.  I hadn't ordered any creatures that had scales.... 

Needless to say, I  wasn't in the mood to continue eating.  I suppose I should have said something to the server but I was feeling rather sick to my stomach and just asked for the bill.  I haven't been back since.  

Two stars because the servers are lovely...but no more than that because of the sugar broth and FISH SCALES!  :("}
{"text":"Basically I go for the takeouts and price as I live around the area.  Service isn't the best but is ok. I'd go for another option on a date or an invite."}
{"text":"The worst sushi I've ever had in my entire life... I ordered sushi under their premium sushi list, it had avocado and cucumber in it..but it tasted like fermented garbage. Vegetable tempura was good, edamame was standard.. I Was still hungry so I ordered a roll with salmon in it and they gave me a roll that had a chunk of cream cheese and mango in it. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great prices. The rolls are delicious and the fish is good quality. Service can be a bit slow but it's still great service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food gets 4 stars. The service gets 2 stars. 

The food is presented nicely, affordable, and quite fresh. Best seafood salad I've had. 

The service however is very, very, very slow. I forewarn, do not sit in one of the booths...they will totally forget you are sitting there. 

The girls that work there do not really have a strong command of the English language, and get very panicked if there is more then 4 tables. That being said, they are extremely friendly. 

I loved eating here, but the service is so excruciatingly slow, or has been the last 3 times I've gone, that I just don't have time to sit for an endless dinner. So I dont go anymore, unless I have some serious time to kill. 

The food is good tho. If you're in a rush, forget it."}
{"text":"Great Food! It's not one of those cheap sushi restaurant you can find in every corner of the street. But the price is unbelievably cheap compare to quality of the food.

I've been here couple time with my wife so far, and i have to admit, it gets really packed for dinner.. 

But the servers are very nice and fast~
Love their maki and sashimi, they're SOOO Fresh!! Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"We go here often but it seems to always be very understaffed as the servers look frantic and are literally running around. 
Also in the winter sitting by the door sucks! 
Food is decent but Id say no different then any other average place."}
{"text":"I like this place. We come here often. The prices are really good and I can hardly ever finish my food. Washing everything down with a Sapporo is just what the doctor ordered. The soup and salads are great. The rolls are big and delicious. The fried ice cream for dessert is always a treat. Often given as a treat by the staff. Sometimes the service is hit and miss but it is a very busy place with many customers coming in and out for sit down meals or take out. Give this place a try if you're in the st. Clair area. Great food. Great prices."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh sushi and awesome prices. Small, clean environment, friendly staff. I am a regular customer and will continue to be. highly recommended, enjoy!"}
{"text":"My family love it here. It's cheap and the quality of food is amazing. It's gets to busy but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went here at lunch time and was pleasantly surprised. The food portions are big, the rolls are tasty and the beer is fairly inexpensive. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood Sushi joint. The food is above average and the service is painfully slow. I keep going back because my girl and I eat our faces off for $38. which ain't exactly high-rolling for a Toronto culinary experience as good as this place. 

I am pretty sure the takeout business is the culprit for the overwhelmed sushi makers, either that or the dudes take the University line down to Lake Ontario to catch some fish...

I am not that pinched for time, so I go with the expectation that even my girlfriend will run out of things to say and eventually I will have some excellent food."}
{"text":"This sushi is very good. Very fresh,

They sometimes take a while to bring and make the sushi, this is negative. But maybe it is worth it, and necessary. Spicy mayo is extra, but it is not even that great. 

But the sushi portions and quality makes up for all of this. Not AYCE."}
{"text":"This place has inconsistent servings, I've been there more than 10 times, the food is tolerable but it's been getting worse recently due to change of owners. 

The salmon sashimi gets smaller and smaller each time I go. Before it used to be a big chunk, now it's a thin slice that comes on a rice block (?!?). 

Sometimes nothing tastes right here and it makes me so disapointed! I hate it when food tastes bad...lol. The udon was too salty, the tea was cold (their tea maker was broken), the sashimi tasted like rotten fish..."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi and it came quick. Good sushi place, would go again. Service was a little slow and it wasn't  busy so it's not a perfect rating."}
{"text":"Portions are big and price is reasonable. The service is excellent.
The place is clean and welled maintained. The food was very tasty."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at this place, seemed to be very packed during dinner hours on a weekday. The sashimi pieces came out humongous, as well as our sushi rolls (black dragon, dynamite, and spicy salmon)- all for a very decent price. Everything was delicious and fresh. Service was average. They need to be more quick with clearing plates because ours just piled up til the end, when we got our bills. Highly recommended if you're around the area and will definitely need to come back!"}
{"text":"Mixed Rating - 5 stars for the food and amazingly low price. 3 stars for the service. The 2 servers are GREAT. But they need at least two more. We were held hostage there 1.5 hours - all we ordered was edamame and a small platter. While we were there, at least 20 people came in to get their take out. Did I mention TWO SERVERS? who have to: answer the phone, take the orders from tables and take out orders, bus the tables, serve the food, get your bill, do it all. These two women are Superwomen, but they lost a lot of people last night who waited at least 15-20 minutes for someone to acknowledge them before leaving. We have been there twice before, once with normal service and once with a pretty extensive delay, but tonight was much worse. We love the price, great portions, and both the sushi and sashimi are very very good, but they are hitting a tipping point of bad service. Be ready for a long dinner."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their dinner. The owner was very nice and so was his wife. They took a great care of us.

The rolls they served us was very interesting. It was called Hollywood Roll which literally has fruits inside and out. You will think it just doesn't look right at the first moment but it was unexpectedly delicious!! It was a new kind of roll sushi and tasting that roll was just an awesome experience to have. It reminded me of having some French crepe. FYI, I'll suggest not to put any soy sauce on that roll!!

I also enjoyed the tuna steak dish and fresh water eel and shrimp tempura roll with slices of avocado on the top. Their shrimp tempura was very crispy which I loved!!

Over all, we spent a great time there and we were satisfied with all the food we got and all the service they provide us. We will definitely be there again!!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going to Sushi California for the crazy affordable prices and decent, large-sized sushi. The last few times, I've waited over 45 minutes after ordering to receive my food.

I ordered takeout yesterday and I was there for 1 hour before my takeout boxes were ready. I was disappointed once I opened the boxes, as everything was soggy and tasted spoiled. It seemed as though it had been sitting there for a while. My friend and I repeatedly asked the hostesses how much longer our food was going to take and they only said \"sorry\" each time. I don't think I will be returning, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Arguably the best tempura in the city, fresh ingredients and plenty of seats . The service is prompt and efficient , if a little cold."}
{"text":"Decent sushi at a nice price.  I ensured I dined here several times prior to this review.  The food is good.  The price is attractive, however if you are not super easy going, this is t the place for you.  Modifiers never seem to make it with your order, asking for an item to come with your dishes, such as spicy mayo, will take four kind reminders and little result.  Now; I don't say this as a snarky review towards the servers.  They are always running and working extremely hard.  It's a lack of training and often a lack of staff.  Long story short:  if you're looking for economical sushi... It's here.  If you're coming expecting anything more then that... You may be let down."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. 

I'm a student at the high school across the street and every time I walk in there, I am absolutely appalled at the service and the abhorrent way they treat people. The owners are incredibly stingy; for example, when I bought a dish there for take-out, they gave me one plastic fork.  I asked for another one, and they wouldn't give it to me unless I paid 25 cents (which is not a big deal, really). This is, all in all, a very small thing.

My larger issue is with the attitude they seem to have towards us high school students. The place is practically always empty, except for during lunchtimes when students flood in to buy food. Their main business essentially comes from the high school students. In light of this fact, you'd think they would treat them well and with dignity. I think this is basic human decency, regardless of the context. However, every time I go in there (which is almost never, because I refuse to give them my business), I  am astonished at how they seem to patronize every high school kid. I understand that there are a lot of high schoolers who are probably rude and who loiter, but that is absolutely NO excuse for the businessowners to act as unprofessionally as they do. An example: They have a sign on their door that says 'No Outside Food or Drink\", which is perfectly fine. Today, however, I was there briefly and witnessed the owner yelling at the top of her lungs at a group of kids who had brought in their own food. They looked perplexed and said that they had bought a dish, but the woman shrieked that she doesn't care and that they can go eat their own food outside and a slew of more inappropriately rude words. The proper way to deal with this, as a businessowner, (no matter how irritated you may be) is to politely ask these people not to bring their own food in or to politely ask them to leave. It is incredibly, unbelievably degrading the way that the owners treat high schoolers seemingly just because we are teenagers. Someone's age doesn't give you the right to degrade them and treat them as if they are parasites, ESPECIALLY when this very person is your patron. 

I am simply in disbelief at this behaviour. Not to mention that their food is not good at all. On the occasions that I have eaten there, I have been extremely disappointed with the service (takes like 20 minutes to make one sushi roll) and with the actual quality of the food. Literally the only incentive for ever buying food there is just lack of other options across from our high school. That's it. The quality of food there is not even comparable to the quality at places like Ginza or 168 sushi for virtually the same price. 

Again, if I could give this place a zero, I would. If I could give it a negative number, I would. I refuse to give business to such rude people and I urge everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi at pretty good prices.

We came here for takeout after a long car trip home from the states. The place is very clean and modern, it would be a great place to eat in if we were in the mood. There are also a few private booths which would be great for a date. 

The sushi was very delicious, with some of the largest pieces of nigiri I'd ever seen, fish and rice-wise. It was all very fresh. I'm very VERY happy to have a good sushi place near my house. They can expect to see a lot more of me."}
{"text":"Good portions and tasty rolls. We were just passing by and did not regret trying it out. Good pricing as well"}
{"text":"What was going to be a five star tip saying to order ahead during the holidays for take out, slowly dwindled to a one star review after being subjected to poor and down right rude customer service along with witnessing other who ordered an hour ahead of time being told their order wasn't ready yet. But to pay and wait. As for me I went in and ordered I was told my order would be half an hour so I went and waited at the neighbouring Starbucks and took in the Easter parade. After 30 minutes I returned to get my food(assuming half an hour meant 30 minutes universally), when I asked the girl working the counter if my sushi was ready she rudely said \"Ya Ya\" waving her hand in my face. She went on to disappear for another half an hour only re-emerging after I advised the customers who placed orders hours ago over the phone to hold off on paying because they where not giving the goods. As for the food its self the spider roll wasn't to my expectation(based on a yelp picture, and the Green roll wasn't what I was given last time. To add to the situation their poor handling of the soy sauce caused a complete mess in the bag. In closing this place is good but not reliable on long holiday weekends when they are ill equipped to handle customers."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I checked this place out. I was drawn in by a sign advertising sushi rolls starting at $1.95 for 8 pieces. I was impressed by the interior. It's really clean and has some nice private booths. The servers were very pleasant almost to the point of being annoying. Everything on the menu was pretty cheap. I ended up getting a chicken bento box and a california roll. The bento was $7 and included teriyaki chicken breast, vegetables, dumplings, veg tempura, rice, soup, ,and salad. The portion was small but everything was awesome. The chicken was properly trimmed (no gristle and flab like other places) and moist. The tempura was crisp. The soup was good. The salad was among the best I've ever had at a sushi place. It wasn't just iceberg, it had baby greens, carrot, tomato, and cucumber with a dressing with a strong garlic flavor. The california roll was 8 pieces for $2.95. It was really good. Big pieces, a huge amount of \"crab\". Well formed and well seasoned rice. The only thing that annoyed me was that there was no tobiko in the roll but it is three dollars less than many other places so I can deal with it. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, the rolls are big and well done. the real problem of this palce are the employees..most of them are slow and not always understand the orders.
Me and my wife used to come to this place but now we are not coming in anymore cause of this reason...also....the bathroom are dirty...really dirty and the table isn't really clean as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my little brother.

During my first visit, I got an avocado roll. Both times, we got the spicy salmon and tuna rolls, along with a red dragon roll. The avocado roll was standard; great for just $2.50. The spicy salmon and tuna rolls could have been a bit bigger, although for $3.50/$5.00 compared to the usual $6.00 per roll at other restaurants, it was good value. The red dragon roll was much bigger than expected - any of their speciality rolls are big enough to order just the one and be satisfied. 

The waitress was a little slow at getting our orders despite how empty the restaurant was, but aside from that it was a pleasant dining experience. The restaurant is clean and modern, and has a nice ambient atmosphere.

There are definitely better sushi places out there, but for its price and location in my neighbourhood, it's definitely worth return visits!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. Food is really fresh. Great atmosphere at the restaurant. We ordered one sushi combo, two rolls and two beers. The bill is less than $40. The service is great, the waitress is really friendly. The food comes really fast. We waited around 5 mins after ordering. Great experience here will go back again!"}
{"text":"The staff here are very frustrating. Our orders have been forgotten about on multiple occasions and just recently it actually took 4 trips to the cash and back just to pay for our meals. My friends and I have come here so frequently that for a period of around three months, we came every Saturday, and I've got to say that the service is getting worse with each visit, and that this might be one of our last trips.
   However the actual sushi here is very good for the price and that is what has kept us coming back."}
{"text":"decent sushi at amazingly low prices.. 
good place to get your casual sushi fix if youre not looking to spend alot. Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"If you live in the Corso Italia area, this place is great!  They offer made to order, inexpensive, typical sushi.  They do have a good selection of vegetarian items, but not a lot in terms of vegan options.  If you communicate well with your waiter or waitress, you can usually negotiate some modifications to accommodate your dietary needs.  Sushi California offers your typical, North American sushi fare; tempura, makis, sushi, sashimi, udons, teriyaki and party trays.  

When my boyfriend and I first moved to the neighbourhood, I wanted to get some food to go on the cheap.  My boyfriend got a chicken terriyaki meal with soup, salad and rice for 7$.  I got three different kinds of rolls.  I know I got a spicy tuna, and avocado but I can't remember the third one.  They were very fresh and tightly rolled.  My boyfriend's meal came with the typical terrible japanese iceberg salad and a decent miso.  The chicken was well cooked and succulent.

I have returned here and the food was excellent.  The place is often busy and sometimes filled with police officers.  The service is excellent and quick.  The only \"disappointment\" I saw in the restaurant was a client who wanted all you can eat sushi.  Sushi California is not all you can eat.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Service is too slow and they even charge for eel sauce, as per everything else is ok. But I have eaten better in close by sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious, and super affordable too! I went there with my boyfriend and we were very impressed by the food that we were brought.  The kamikaze roll was so good, as well we got the rainbow roll, Philadelphia roll and a green dragon, all of which were very good. We also ordered two hand rolls which blew me away because they were so huge! And totally stuffed and tasted amazing. When trying to guess our bill at the end, we were very pleasantly surprised as our guesses were off by about 20$. The portions were enormous, also every roll is about 8-10 pieces but each piece is almost the size of two regular pieces which is crazy.  Then when we went to leave, they brought us complimentary tempura ice cream which was incredible. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I loved that restaurant! The food is very tasty, the size are generous, the waitress was very kind, the decorations were nice and I felt cozy in one of their booths, they have an individual bell to call the waitress that doesn't take long to come back. The only reason I didn't gave a 5 stars is because the front face doors were a bit dirty on the outside."}
{"text":"Reliably tasty sushi and sashimi. Definitely recommend this for an affordable and quick meal. I tend to take out from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and crazy cheap. Go here with people you are close to, because you will be stuffing your face in very unflattering ways and you need to be able to trust your friends to not take photographs for social media posts. Seriously though, this is the best cheap sushi I've had in TO. Very fresh, very well executed, very large, and very very cheap. Dinner for 2, with one more roll than we needed (these rolls are HHHUUUGGGE) was $28. This is ridiculous. Service is meh, but they have these awesome private booths, so at least you are comfortable if you are waiting around for service. And every other place in this nightborhood is closed on Mondays, but they were open, so that's important. Well worth it, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Come here about once every month or two... it's our go-to sushi place in our neighbourhood (not that we've tried any others!)  We keep going back because it's just become one of the locals that we know will be good; no surprises or bad experiences.  The first time we walked in a year ago, we weren't expecting much, but were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, and it's not overpriced either.

Usually get the spicy tuna roll, the tempura set appetizer, the seaweed salad (yummy!), and 1-2 of their \"Signature Rolls\", which are always good.  We've tried the Green Dragon roll, Dynamite roll, and the Caterpillar roll (topped with fresh avocado).  Anyway, all of them have been good and we're never disappointed.

They are sometimes quite busy, but we ALWAYS get one of their private booths which are great if you are 2-4 people.  The servers are really nice, not super attentive but that doesn't bother me since I'm just there to eat sushi, drink a Sapporo can and chat with my partner.  The booths have a little call-button that you can push anyway, if you need anything or want the bill.

This place is not exactly worth a special trip if you don't live in the area; it's not going to blow your mind or anything... but it's definitely worth trying if you live near Corso Italia and have a sushi craving.

They give everyone a little deep-fried ice cream ball with the bill which is cute too."}
{"text":"I was taken her by a friend who is a regular at this joint. I was skeptical as soon as I looked at the menu prices - they're low, VERY low = good! 
Ordered a black dragon and spicy tuna. When the black dragon arrived, it was big. Enough to serve one person as a meal. At this point, I realized I ordered too much. The spicy tuna was good, topped with crispy tempura bits. I'm still in shock at the low prices. The quality is good although I noticed they don't have any sashimi only combos. Also, there's only two waitresses, and they seem to have a huge take-out crowd so it gets busy. I think eating here might even be cheaper then eating at an AYCE joint, and you might be surprised how full you are. 
I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"By far our favourite sushi restaurant in the city. Have been going here since they first opened. Great quantity and quality at a low price.  Only thing is they have become increasingly busy, and need to figure out how to manage that."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto! Excellent and fresh sushi , great prices, friendly service and nice decor. I make the long drive here as much as possible."}
{"text":"Love this place and the prices are great

Very creative sushi rolls

Great tasting tempura vegetables as well
Very busy place so call ahead for pick up but it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day. Amazing Service, very quick, delicious, and best part cheap. 18 rolls for less than $5."}
{"text":"This spot was my sushi spot in highschool. Cheap, tasty sushi and fills you up. For rolls i would always get the sushi california, ocean spicy and either the cowboy or spider rolls. I would also recommend the double spicy tuna roll. The deluxe combo sets have generous sashimi cuts and with the sushi it definitely fills you up. 

There are regular table seats and booth seats. They do take out service as well. Very busy during dinnertime hours! If you are in the area and want sushi definitely check Sushi california out!"}
{"text":"Meal was good until I let them know that maguro(red tuna) didn't taste right, in fact it taste like canned fish. 

We were in one of their booths and feel awkward pushing the call button frequently, so we chose to wait until the end of them meal to let them know the red tuna didn't taste right.  We had ordered 2 pieces, which is the restaurant minimum.  At the end of the meal we asked to have our left overs packed up, minus the tuna because it didn't taste good.  The server apologized.  I asked that the item be taken off the bill because it wasn't good.  She walked away and came back saying the chef says it's fresh.  I said that really isn't the point, it doesn't taste good.  Then a server came back and said they had spoken to the manager and let me know they would not be refunding the 2 pieces of sushi.  It was at that point we agreed to pay the bill and let them know that I would be writing a negative review.  I'm still shocked that this was their choice, rather than try it themselves recognize the flavor was off, and refund the money.  I hope that manager sees this review and reevaluates how they treat their customers.  We will not be going back, and I will be spreading the word to avoid Sushi California."}
{"text":"Pretty dull seeming and empty Sushi and Korean restaurant at what is otherwise a rather busy plaza at Clark and Dufferin.
Prices are not unreasonable but service was slow and perfunctory. The state of the place left much to be desired with words carved into the wood trim in the walls, poor menus, and sketchy people hanging around, one of whom nearly had me calling the cops. Mostly take-out and very few people at tables for dinner.
The food left much to be desired; having had tempura udon on multiple occasions, I've never had it served with such little (two pieces) and overcooked tempura or with a broth I had no desire to finish eating after two spoonfuls.
Sushi options are plentiful, but with an inability to identify the type of cooked fish in the roll I ordered, it might be worth sticking to something simple."}
{"text":"Sushi California was so good.
My friend and I decided to do a sushi challenge because a) we're disgusting and b) because we can.
We were staying in on a Friday night and we thought, what's a good way to spend our time. We decided upon this: we would order 100 pieces of sushi between the two of us and sit in bed until we consumed them all.
That's where Sushi California came in.
They had great prices and a great selection. I can confirm the sushi tasted amazing too.
It came to $75 for 100 rolls.
The service was average time for take out on a Friday night.
And I didn't complete the challenge in case you were wondering. 
I ate 30 in one sitting, the self loathing set in but thankfully it was gone by the morning where I was able to consume the other 20 for breakfast. 
#fighter"}
{"text":"Always so busy! Call ahead or try to get a booth! Amazing prices, good quality sushi. I always get the tempura and the miso soup; they are amazingggg. 
Must try place!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is packed on a Friday night!  Being one of the only two Japanese restaurants in this area, and the good pricing they offer, I understand the appeal.  I normally get the Seafood Udon or the Soft Shell Crab appetizer, which are both great.  This time I ordered the Chicken Karage appetizer and Spider Roll (10 pcs), the taste was ok but the rice was too mushy and fell apart easily.  Their version of Chicken Karage here is spongy, not crispy at all.  The ratio of the coating is a bit more than the meat, the texture feels chewy and dry.  The honey-tasting sauce came with dish, but I would prefer the usual spicy mayo.  
The restaurant is nicely decorated, bright and clean, service is quick, food is decent, portion is good for its price (bento boxes are great deals).  Although some dishes are hit-and-miss, it is worth a try if you are in the area and in the mood for some Japanese."}
{"text":"Service management was terrible. They got our order mixed up. The table beside us ordered after us but got their food before us.

The food was mediocre was best. The sushi was lukewarm. The sushi rice was a little soggy. The price was reasonable, but why settle when there are better options closer to Bloor or in Markham."}
{"text":"Okay they have MASSIF pieces of sashimi. Like MASSIF. I got a deluxe combo for $15 and it was more than I could handle. I can't believe how big the pieces are. And they're fresh!!!! So good. Pay extra $2 for all salmon sashimi. Yaaas.

Apparently it's busy during rush hours but the prices are cheap and the food is unbelievable. 

No regraaaats."}
{"text":"Typical sushi prices but lacking in every other respect.  This place is right across from a high school so I can understand why the tables are all mangled with scrapings of graffiti and scribbles.  Being there at 8:00 at night and being the only customers ordering food you would think that things would be fast and the staff would be efficient.

I felt like we had come in when they were hoping that once the other table of people finished up they would be able to close early for the night.  The kitchen had lots of noise and all the staff were hiding back there but it certainly wasn't because they were in any rush to serve us."}
{"text":"The rolls are inexpensive and delicious! Such a hidden gem, would recommend to any sushi lover on a budget."}
{"text":"We aren't what you call \"experimental\" sushi eaters. We like to play it safe with the most generic type of sushi there is. So perhaps I am the wrong person to review a Sushi place. However, I do know good food and freshness when I eat it.

Sushi California is about a 5-7 minute drive from us, so coming to this establishment is almost convenient more than anything. 

Staff: Most of the staff barely speak English so it's extremely difficult to communicate with them as some just don't understand what you are saying to them. In addition, the service can be extremely slow. Some of the girls are stomping around rushing to attend to everyone. They look frantic and almost confused. Hasn't management or someone caught on yet? 2 girls cannot run a full house, plus take out, plus the cash? The waitresses will get you what you want but it's one of those \"you have to ask for everything\" type of deal. 

Booths: Require some dusting. I was looking over at my wonderful partner only to see a clump of dust waving around at the top of the booth's wall about 6 feet above his head. Thankfully they have high ceilings but someone really needs to stand up on those booths after closing and take a Swiffer duster to those bad boys. The Portuguese in me almost took on the task myself.

Food: For the most part, DELICIOUS. This is the reason as to why I keep coming back. The sushi that we order is always fresh and delicious. Again, we don't venture off to exotic sushi types, so I cannot comment on that kind of stuff nor can I discuss anything raw fish related. The bento boxes (specifically the chicken and beef) are VERY good. The chicken is cooked perfectly so it is still most yet has a nice golden sear. The sauce and bean sprout mix they include with it is also very tasty and adds some moisture to the chicken. The salad has a sweet dressing that compliments the garden mix perfectly. They also include a perfect amount of tempura vegetables (1 mushroom, 1 broccoli), 2 deep fried veggie dumplings and a nice chunk of fresh sticky rice. Writing all this out actually has me craving the Bento Box now!

This alone is good enough for a lunch time meal. We have also ordered the shrimp tempura (a favourite that we constantly get), deep fried California rolls (beware- VERY BIG lol) and just recently we got their veggie spring rolls- small but a great app size).

Previously we've had Bulgogi donburi, which was a huge portion, beef was cooked perfectly and the whole dish was extremely flavourful. 

The only thing that was a MISS is the chicken karage. I don't know what the hell that was, but it sure as hell didn't taste like \"chicken\". They should rename this item to deep fried over seasoned batter. It was god awful and nightmare worthy.

It's not a bad place to go for some cheap inexpensive sushi and co. What keeps me coming back are those delicious bento boxes that are packed with a variety of options.

OOOOH! They also have this delicious deep fried ice cream deliciousness on a stick that I'd willing devour a plate full if possible. They used to give a small sample as a \"thank you\" if your bill was over a certain amount. I guess they got cheap and stopped doing that but you can still order it as a dessert, however, I think it only comes in variations of 5-6. Regardless, if you have room for dessert, GET IT."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! So much better than the place that used to be in this location. Great rolls, very reasonably priced. It's never busy and is relatively kid friendly. Definitely glad this place exists in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place on Christmas Eve with a few friends. Because of the timing we were the only people in the place so the service was prompt. I have to say the prices were shockingly low (Miso under $1, handrolls between $2-5). The prices were enough to make me a fan, but would the food be any good? Some dishes were tried-and-true, but others had some unexpected twists (ie drizzled with orange-sesame mayo) so don't bring any nay-sayers. The rolls are some of the largest I have ever seen and I've eaten sushi all over Canada and the US. 

Highly recommended. Try the Green Dynamite Roll (classic dynamite roll with A LOT of avocado on top!). Grab yourself a private booth."}
