{"text":"Back here Oct 2014 and the service and food remains impeccable! Snails, frommage and an amazing black bass fish special were standouts. The waiters and the bartenders are exceptionally knowledgeable. Tradition reigns supreme.

Note: this is traditional French cuisine NOT Qu√©becois - I stand corrected from my 2013 visit :)"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant in Montreal.  The price-to-quality ratio of this place is superb.  I purposely went on a Tuesday night because I knew I would be able to get same day reservations here but normally that would not happen.  From the first time I walked in I felt at home in both the restaurant and in terms of the service.  The staff were very attentive and polite, which you would expect at a high end place like this.

The food was amazing.  I had the prime rib steak and my companions had the braised lamb shank and rib steak.  I sampled both meals and they were absolutely heavenly.  For an appetizer I had the octopus and I must say it was the best I've ever had.  I have tried octopus and squid at many different locations and the salad they made was out of this world.

The ambiance is very elegant and romantic and the perfect place to have a few drinks or for a special dinner.  I would highly recommend giving this place a try if you are looking for a classy place to have a nice meal and relax."}
{"text":"We didn't mind the Tyvek across the street, it was a holiday weekend, so there was no construction noise, and the place looked quite inviting, the weather outside was pretty good, so we sat outside. I had read a lot of positive things about Le Mas Des Olivers, especially on YELP, which is most cases reliable. However, though the restaurant was beautiful, and waiters very charming, personally, I felt the food was sub-par. I know, I know, why did we order the predictable onion soup? Because both my boyfriend and I adore it, but the onion soup had to be the worst on the planet, It tasted as if the chef had fallen asleep with a box of salt in his hand. I was sick for two days from the amount of salt, and I was too sheepish to let them know. My fault. Boyfriend, who never complains about anything (God bless his soul), whispered to me during the repast that he felt the soup was a bit too salty! A Bit??? Canned anchovies have less salt in them!! We then moved onto the main course. I had a steak, he had the surf and turf. My steak was good, well seasoned, tasty, with nice steamed veggie, and a really great small salad, I could not complain, however.... Boyfriend's steak was the size of a dime, and the lobster tail was awful! What could be worse than an extremely overcooked, dried out and glued to the shell lobster tail? (Yes, the onion soup!!!)  And please do not order an iced tea.... it was scary, foamy (?) and bitter. Dessert was not so bad as all the rest. The Mille Feuille tasted very homemade, pastry crispy and delicious with fresh fruit and a beautiful and sensuous cream. The chocolate mousse was very good as well, piped into a cocktail glass, with a rich strong chocolate topping. Go there for dessert, because dessert won't cost you $180, which included only 1 small inexpensive glass of wine, and an ice tea (if you want to call it that). Who would think that you could have a bad meal in Montreal? I certainly did not! Oh yeah, and by the way, right next door to Le Mas Des Oliviers was a West Indian place that was packed to the rafters. A strong and steady crowd moved in and out, some carrying take out bags, others not. Next time I go to Montreal to see my boyfriend, we are headed there, for sure, instead!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to go.my friend had a birthday party here. Every body quite enjoy the food. I love the escargot herb  butter."}
{"text":"The rib steak served was out of this world. Not to mention the mashed potatoes and just plain old great customer service."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant. Meat was perfectly done. Very friendly staff offering great service. 
Excellent deserts as well."}
{"text":"When our friends arrived from out of town and wanted to eat 'real french' we knew there was only one place to go, Le Mas Des Oliviers.  Trendy restaurants come and go.....mostly go....but Le Mas has been around for many many years and our dinner reaffirmed why.  The service is very professional without being standoffish and the table d'hote is long and varied with many choices and very good value. We were 4 and all ordered from this menu.  To start there is a choice of soup (the absolutely best clam chowder I have ever tasted.....strange in a traditional french resto), snails of the day mmmmmmmmmmmmm and a wonderful salad with olives, cherry tomatoes and cashews.  This salad must have been 'local' because each component was delicious be itself but as a salad was wonderful.
We had 4 different mains and of course we all sampled each.  The veal chop was perfect, nothing more to say.  The rabbit was very good. The dish I ordered was two types of beef, a small filet and braised short ribs accompanied by mashed potatoes that were delicious. The filet was cooked perfectly and very good but the braised short ribs were, well TO DIE FOR! My friend ordered a plate of 4 different meats, duck, beef, lamb and fois gras.  She could not speak, she was moaning as she was eating! You really must have the frites so we ordered some for the table and they were also perfect.
There really wasn't room for dessert...but we 'suffered' through.  The napoleon was flaky light and delicious layered with whipped cream and fresh berries and the chocolate mousse was equally delish.
On the owners suggestion, we ordered  a bottle of the house red as it was from an area of France where we enjoy the wine and we were not disappointed
There is a reason that Le Mas endures and that is the reason we keep going back.  We are never disappointed as we sometimes are with flash in the pan trendy places where the the decor and wait staff and more important than the food."}
{"text":"My friend Carol and I dined here in November 2012, the concierge at our hotel suggested it when we inquired after authentic French cuisine. The service was excellent, the staff courteous, professional with a dash of savoir fair. As neither of us are particularly familiar with French food, we asked our waiter for recommendations for food and wine. we were not disappointed! The Fois Gras was excellent as was the escargot. Both of us enjoyed out main dishes, as well, though I cannot recall what we had as I am writing this review a year and a half afterwards. We enjoyed the wines, and had dessert and coffee afterwards.  
Let me put it to you this way...Carol (who enjoys fine wines and dining)  was recently in MTL, she emailed wanting to know the name of Les Mas Des Oliviers. I looked it up for her, and thought it best to add one more vote for a superb classic establishment."}
{"text":"This was for my husband's birthday. And this was the exact place he wanted to go to.  It was right across the street from our Airbnb place.  The reviews was great so we had to try this place.  Expensive but why not splurge for a birthday if you have the money.  The waiter was very attentive and left us alone as well.  When we first walked in saw the maiter'd, we asked to sit outside, but it seem the patio was full already. I did see a couple of tables that weren't being used, so I asked if we could sit there.  He checked and then let us sit there. Too nice to be sitting inside in the late afternoon/evening.  Hubby had a steak rare.  I had the grilled salmon. And we had a bottle of red wine drank it all up. After all we weren't driving.  And ordered a souffle it had to take 20 minutes to bake, but was worth it once we did receive it."}
{"text":"This little gem was recommended to us by the hotel concierge and I had to go thank her afterwards. The food was very good, while it cost around $40 it included an appetizer and a desert. I had escargot puff pastry, Surf and Turf and a chocolate mousse and it was all amazing. I picked at my friends' combo plate (foie gras, filet, lamb chops and duck breast), rabbit dish and veal dish and they were all great. Service was very good, if a bit stuffy. 
My only qualm was that outdoor seating faces a kinda creepy looking empty lot."}
{"text":"Very average. I used to go to this place often about 12 years ago and the food was phenomenal, as these years progressed, the quality and service decreased, so we stopped going. After many years, we decided to try it again. To our dismay, it was just OK. The Cesar salad, was intense, way to much garlic and minimal flavors. The steak au poivre was fine, but for $40, you would expect a bit better than fine. Some others at our table had the veal chop with a mushroom-cognac sauce, which was just borderline,. Honestly, the sauce you could have mistake for a package.  The atmosphere is still the same, nice and traditional French, but with this goes the attitude and stiffness of the waiters."}
{"text":"I will put it bluntly...absolutely a must-go if you are ever in Montreal!

As others have stated, the French food here is incredible.  I believe they try to get as much local fare as possible, and you can really tell in the quality of the ingredients and the taste of the food.  If ever there was a desire to get some excellent French fare, this is definitely the place to go!

I actually found this restaurant by accident while looking through another website, but seeing as how there are so few reviews for it here on Yelp, I thought I should add one.   ;-)

I had a fantastic meat lover's dish (Assorted Mignardises...) of foie gras, duck leg (girlfriend got the duck breast), tenderloin, and rack of lamb.  My girlfriend had the duck breast special of the day.  Woah, what a combination!  The sauces they used were in some cases subtle, others contrasting, to the different meats and were really spot on!  As a wannabe foodie, I have to admit, I was impressed.

Foie gras...well, not my favorite, but I am willing to go with it when it's on my plate.  Geez louise, does it always taste this good?!?!  I really thought I was eating a very well flavored meat pudding that just melted in my mouth.  I have had foie gras before, and it did not taste like this...outstanding!

To be fair, you can't compare the quality of certain meats to that of the United States...truly, I have travelled around the world and outside of the Wagyu beef in Japan, there isn't meat available that can rival the quality that comes from the States.  Knowing this, I can say that though this wasn't the 'best' beef I have ever had in my life, it was certainly excellent!

Lamb chops, this is usually hit or miss.  On this one, definitely a hit!  Fantastic, and with nice contrasting flavors to not overwhelm the taste of the lamb.

The duck leg was moist and delicious, and my preference for dark meat definitely skews my opinion here...my girlfriend had the duck breast.  For my taste it was a little dry, but she seemed to love it...it wasn't my meal, so other than the taste I had, no further comment.

We finished off with the chocolate mousse...OMG!  It has been a while since I have had really good, rich, thick and creamy mousse.  Whenever I order it in restaurants it usually comes out looking and tasting more like pudding than mousse.  Disappointment to say the least.  But, the mousse here was fantastic!  You know it's delicious and made just right when the first spoonful enters your mouth, sits there on top of of your tongue, and as it floats there it envelops your taste buds with the richness of chocolate that we all love!  Wow!  Great stuff!

Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Classy, quiet restaurant. You'll see some white haired Montreal politicians every time. The place you'd go for a special birthday or anniversary. The waiters are polite, pleasant, and funny if you get them going. The food is downright perfect, french cuisine. Be sure to get the Escargot."}
{"text":"This was our pick for a \"fancier\" French dinner and it did NOT disappoint! With a plate of veggies and olives waiting on the table, this restaurant has plentiful and great table d'h√¥te options that come with either a soup/salad, an entree and a dessert. 

My mom, brother and I each ordered off that menu and mom got the duck breast which was cooked perfectly in a delightful red wine sauce. She loved that it wasn't too salty or heavy. My brother got the veal chop which was GINORMOUS and accompanied with some potatoes. He finished the whole thing and was extremely pleased with the cook. I got the cod ontop of mashed potatoes and the cook was magnificent. Drowning in a sauce (that was al little too heavy for my taste), the cod itself was flaky and not overcooked or dry. It was amazing and I had no trouble finishing it. 

The table d'h√¥te came with a spinach salad with egg or a vegetable soup and both were large and filled with ingredients. Finally, we tried all three desserts that came with each meal being the chocolate mousse, profiteroles and a frozen nougat. Surprisingly, the nougat was our favourite since it wasn't too sweet, pistachio filled and a nice palate cleanser. The profiterole was not very special but still good and the chocolate mousse wasn't very dark but not too sweet either.

Overall, the ambience is really nice, great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I've always gone here with lawyers or politicians, it's a sort of man's club.
Don't let that scare you, it's got it's charm, starting with Tony who greets you at door.
Great to see free tapas on each table, very classy move.
Lots of great choices on menu, I very much enjoyed the shrimp appetizers and tuna steak. They also have a fantastic cheese selection."}
{"text":"Montreal- Fantastic meal made to seem effortless by the staff an kitchen- escargot, wine and margret de canard was excellent start to finish"}
{"text":"The short version:  This is a very sober, competent, reliable old school eatery for grownups.  

I've been in for supper a few times, always as part of a company group of about 50 sitting down to a very limited table d'h√¥te, and it still impresses under these logistically-trying wedding conditions.  As others have said, main course portions are generous.  Our party has always been sufficiently staffed with busboys and waiters, and plates appear and disappear with alacrity.  Bread barges are constantly renewed.  Only service complaint last night was that the water glasses at our table were never topped-off, though the wineglasses were being kept up.  But otherwise, the service is reliably quiet, observant, courteous, and professional.

As for the food, be prepared for very dense, intensely-flavored, richly-sauced fare.  The house palate has the tone and heft of a cognac ad in a 1970s Playboy magazine.  Nouvelle cuisine, it ain't.  But the soups I've tried have been quite lovely, their Caesar salad is the best-seasoned and tastiest I've eaten in the city, and the kitchen clearly knows its way around a lamb shank.

They also make a very credible gin martini- hard to find in Montreal.

I will gladly continue to eat here on the company's tab, but it's also on my short list of places in Montreal I'd take an intelligent, hungry friend for a few hours of serious conversation in a quiet corner. The service here seems particularly adept at enabling that."}
{"text":"This place is fine. Food is very French, very delicate. However, if you don't want to ruin your night at this place, make sure that you won't order the foie gras. It's terrible. It tastes like crappy ice cream..."}
{"text":"This is my cousin's husband's favorite restaurant in Montreal, and since he grew up here and knows about food, we trusted his recommendation. 

What is Le Mas des Oliviers like? As the loud woman who thought she was the only diner in the restaurant described: \"I am at an expensive French restaurant in downtown.\" 

The decor is old school, and so is the service, very professional and friendly. Food came in such enormous portions that they justify the high prices. My Chilean bass was $38, but it came with soup or salad. I chose soup which was delicious and the bass was amazing. It's buttery and tender and creamy---what classic french cooking is all about. 

My husband had the bison, which was slightly tough. 

If we had know how stuffed we'd be by end of the meal, we wouldn't have ordered a grand marnier souffle in advance. But it was tasty, and I managed to have some bites and took half of my bass home instead. 

Being a classic french restaurant, their tea selection is unsurprisingly quite sad. Between earl grey and green tea, I chose the green tea, but it's one of those green tea that came with all kinds of lemongrass herbal crap. 

Note to self: just order a coffee next time."}
{"text":"Great little French restaurant that I would have never thought to go in just looking at it from the outside.  The door has seen better days and looks like you are about to enter the Bar B Barn...but once inside, the decor changes significantly!

I had duck and veal and even ate all my vegetables!  One of the tastiest dinners I've had in some time.  The service was also fantastic.  Very attentive, joked with us a bit, and suggested some food and wine.  

The decor is classy, white table clothes and stuff.  It's quiet and rustic.  I couldn't help but notice the colourfully lit up breathalizer in the corner...didn't really suit this type of resto but better safe than sorry I suppose!"}
{"text":"I had the escargot and the lamb dish.  Nothing special.  Everything was covered with a brown sauce.  I didn't even know that there were veggies under the meat and sauce until I got midway through my meal.  The sauce made the entire dish taste the same.  The escargot - nothing special.  I've had better in many other restaurants.  The dessert was good - Napoleon cake and profiterol, although the profiterols are not the real ones like they serve in France.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and everything we ordered was delicious. First time my kids ever had escargot and they loved it.  House red wine was very good and a good deal at $33/bottle. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and had a wonderful culinary experience. I had the filet au poivre and it was without a doubt one of the best dishes I've had in my entire life. The waiters are extremely friendly and attentive to your needs and the restaurant itself is lovely and very inviting. 

The prices may seem high but it's totally worth it because the quality of the food and service is like no other. It's the perfect restaurant to go to for a romantic date or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than simply fantastic food. Our waiter was hilarious and really accommodating to my baby niece! Our table tried the fois gras, the duck, the lamb, the steak and lobster surf and turf and the veal. Very good potatoes as side. On the pricy side but so so good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing food! My colleague and I were looking for a good place that was in walking distance to the hotel. Based on the yelp reviews, we went here. We are so happy yelp didn't let us down! Just as Frederick Y. said previously, a must-go restaurant in Montreal. 

We had no reservations and were able to walk right in. The ambiance is very quaint and relaxed, but not casual. We were seated and immediately dove into the complementary relish tray. The olives and sausage were a tasty prelude to the wonderful meal to come.

We both had the onion soup. Even though it became notably saltier as we continued to eat, it was good. The house red wine was very good, too.

Next, I had the lamb shank and my colleague had the duck. This was the most tender and flavorful lamb shank I've ever had! It was in a dark, rich gravy flavored by sun-dried tomatoes and garlic. Even the root vegetables on the side were very good and not just an afterthought. My colleague thoroughly enjoyed the duck entree, which was accompanied by an apple gravy. Lastly, even though both of us were totally full, we decided to share the profiteroles. They were filled with ice cream and swimming in a wonderful, semi-sweet chocolate sauce. This was the perfect ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Le Mas Des Oliviers is rustic and homey. Please, don't get me wrong, there are certainly elements of fine dining that show through, but a meal here is best thought of as being invited to enjoy a meal directly from the kitchen of your Uncle (who happens to be a world class french chef). Now add Michele, whose dry French wit and devotion to service established the comfy, yet professional attitude that surrounded us and you will begin to experience the beauty of Le Mas Des Olivier. The house pat√™ was creamy, savory, and delivered on that spot on flavor you would expect from a perfectly prepared terrine. The pairing with cornichons, pickled pearl onions, and sweet caramelized onions was a scrumptious bite. The escargot melted in my mouth, along with the well balanced flavors of butter and garlic. The main course of steak au poivre was just as tender. The peppercorns in the sauce added just a slight bite to the perfectly done meat. The sides of scalloped potatoes were the perfect balance of cream, butter, and starch...and perfectly seasoned. The piece de resistance however, was the foie gras. I have never had liver that has been prepared so well. It was a decadent treat to add to an already delectable meal. Our dessert of puff pastry ice cream sandwiches with chocolate ganache was  a wonderful sweet treat then end the evening.  Please ask for Tony as well, the host who showed us what French hospitality truly is and that anyone that walks into the door of Le Mas Des Olivier can be called family. If you are a Montreal native, please give this place a chance, you will not be disappointed. Or, if you are traveller, like me, make this one of your stops...you can thank me later."}
{"text":"No problem accommodating a group of ten.  Phenomenal food.  This is the best description I can give.  Attentive congenial staff.  I mean when we finished and it's pouring rain they called cabs and when they didn't come our waiter went out and flagged them down.  Cozy attractive decor.  Authentic French cuisine!  YUM!  Willing to do individual checks."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've probably walked by this place millions of times but never tried it until about a week ago.  It doesn't look like much from the street but inside a truly fantastic food experience awaits you.  The decor is cosy and the service is top notch.  Their focus is on French food and they do that well.

When you sit down they bring you a plate of chorizo sausage, olives and carrots.   While the sausage is tasty don't fill up here because there is lots more to come!  To start we split a platter that included confit de canard, grilled shrimps, grilled mushrooms and fried calamari.  The calamari in particular were very well done.  They were crispy and cooked just right.  To add to that I ordered the duck in green peppercorn sauce.  The duck was well done and fell apart.  The sauce was a pleasant addition.  You could really taste the peppercorns and it was salted just right.  They also brought some fries to the table to be shared by everyone and those were quite good.

I finished off the night with a chocolate lava cake.  This is one of my desserts so my expectations are always high when I order it.  Fortunately this one lived up to those expectations.  It was piping hot and they succeeded in leaving the interior uncooked.

Portions are huge so come hungry or be prepared to share with your dining companions.  As for reservations they don't seem an absolute must.  While it was busy when I came you probably could have gotten a table without a reservation."}
{"text":"Seems like this restaurant has really good reviews.  We were in the area and found this place on yelp with really good reviews.  The food was average (at least the ones I ordered).  I ordered the escargot for appetizer, duck for the entree, and chocolate moose cake for dessert."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little restaurant. I would recommend to everyone. The staff is nice, attentive and friendly. The food was great I would completely go back without a doubt."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. We stopped in based on the hotels recommendation and it wasn't too bad. For starters, they have a complimentary bit of bread, smoked meat, carrots (weird?), and olives.

We skipped on appetizers and ordered a bottle of the house wine for the table and went straight for the main course. I ordered the stag steak, which wasn't anything special by itself. The sauce didn't really give or take anything from the flavor. By cutting up the onion and eating it together with the steak was when it really came to lfe. The stag could've used some more marinade or additional flavoring for the sauce."}
{"text":"i used to come here a couple of times a week as a child.

came back here a week ago and they still remembered me.  some things have changed from the past the good food is still here.

if you are looking for traditional french fare, come on by.  unlike paris, the portions are quite generous.

i had the escalope de veau which was delicious - i ate the whole plate.
my parents and brother (despite their freak of nature ability to eat a whole cow gene) all took home leftovers for the ris de veau, the confit de canard and the jarret d'agneau.

the house own wine used to be much better and measured by the pours but times have changed.  still not bad.

of course, a meal is nothing without dessert so try the creme brulee but i prefer the profiteroles - yummy puffs with ice cream and hot choco sauce.

on sundays, they have their legendary mille feuille.  a definite to try item!"}
