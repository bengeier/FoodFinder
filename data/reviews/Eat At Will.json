{"text":"I went here with my fianc√©, who found the place, because he's not been as exposed to Gujurati food growing up, and we hadn't found any good Gujurati places in Calgary. Hosts, Jai and Dimple, are wonderful people - the food they make is fresh and tastes like it would at home. We ordered the Thaali for an early dinner - it came with rice, 3 rotis, 2 sabjis, daal and paapad, with some pickle too. We were a bit slow at eating the rotis, so they waited until we were close to being done to bring us hot, fresh ones (instead of piling on a bunch at first which may have gotten cold). Food was wonderfully simple with the right amount of salt and spice.   One thing I would recommend is to order ahead of you want seriously authentic Gujurati food - we had amazing Dabeli and simple Dhoklas for appetizers. Unfortunately though, Jai and Dimple have to cater to an audience that isn't quite familiar with real Gujurati food (they have to make the quintessential butter chicken to be able to sell their stuff), so the unless you order ahead you might not get things like Thepla, Gujurati daal (different from usual daal tadka or makhni), Khandvi and so on.   We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here - food was great, hosts were hospitable and price was extremely reasonable. We're planning to order some authentic Gujju food this weekend and will definitely be going back often. I recommend people go here and try something that's not butter chicken; the more we ask for authentic Gujurati, the more these guys can make them available to us without having to order ahead. I hope everyone who goes here likes it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"Truly the best Indian food I have eaten in Calgary!  Great value for your money, authentic cuisine - a great blend of spice and savory. Take out, dine in or have it delivered - whatever you choose but just choose Eat at Will!"}
{"text":"So good and so authentic! Picture a hole in the wall, out comes a seductive smell, you trust your nose, follow the smell and ten minutes later your taste butts are SOOOOOO thankful!  It's a very small location with one table for two and another 3 seats at the window. Very simple, a takeout place. But if you stay, you get to eat out of these metal trays that make you wonder if you are in prison. But there is no chance they would serve such good food in prison... so where am I? Flavor heaven?   The flavor of the food is to die for! Takes me right back to India! The menu is super small but great; you order a combo of one or two curries which comes with rice and naan. Yes, of course you order two curries! In fact, the price for the combo is so small, you should order two dishes, that way you get to try four curries, can it get any better?   There are some options for your sweet tooth as well. Wanna throw a flavor heaven party? They do catering!!! A family run business, the man takes the orders, the woman cooks, and the kid plays behind the counter :) Go try it!!!"}
{"text":"A great place for takeout.  Delicious Gujarati cuisine made by owner Jay.  Call ahead 10-15 minutes or you will have to wait there for your food while he cooks it.  Lots of different vegetarian entrees as he has a different daily special."}
{"text":"If you want to try good authentic Indian food then this is the place.we were introduced to eat at will by a friend of ours and ever since we have been a fan.Absolutely love their Khaman and dhokla but you have to order ahead sometimes because they run out of these fast."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh Indian food, great variety, especially if you order well in advance (4 hours or more), they have great options.  Best butter chicken I have had in Calgary, but they also have great lamb, and the fish dish was so tender. Smashed potatoes, is the kids favourite veggie dish."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this place!! Had tried an appetizer from the catered event and had to order from here right away. Everything we ordered was so tasty and nice and spicy. We love Indian food and have tried quite a few in the city, this may be our new favourite!! The family that runs it are so nice and the food is a must try! Can't wait to go back and try more from the menu. Great prices and you get TONS of food for your money. Good for vegetarians and meat eaters...YUM!!!"}
{"text":"After reading some reviews I was somewhat sceptical that the food could be as good as advertised but it was as good if not better. Perfectly spiced and great flavour! The chicken tikka masala was creamy and light. The lamb curry was spicy and rich. I will be back many times to try out all of the different dishes."}
