{"text":"Very good. The Italian beef is just like Chicago. Really good. The Vienna beef dog is true Chicago. And the fries are really tasty too. Highly recommended place to eat. And the owner is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"These hot dogs are the best I have found in the \"burgh\". As soon as you walk in there is a life-size photo of Mike Ditka and a Chicago skyline photo that takes up most of the wall. There is Chicago sports memorabilia is everywhere. Yovi's is a simple place but the food is amazing. My co-worker has been to Chicago, I have not YET, and she said these dogs are the real deal!! If you like hot dogs, you have to try Yovi's in Market Square!"}
{"text":"They take credit cards now! All the other reviews are correct - great dogs, great fries, great Italian beef."}
{"text":"First time here. Couldn't be more pleased with our experience. It was a busy Saturday but tables were clean, food was fast and hot, and customer service was excellent. One gentleman took our order, cooked our food, and made sure to come out and ask how everything was. (Assuming he's the owner) The Italian sausage was excellent! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best hot dog shop in Pittsburgh!  The staff is great, the service is fast and the food is perfect!"}
{"text":"The only place in Pittsburgh to get Chicago Italian Beef and its the best!"}
{"text":"Best hot dog I've had in years. I got sauerkraut, pickles, peppers, onion, ketchup, and mustard on mine. My friend got chili cheese and said it was delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is THE best hot dog place in Pittsburgh!!!! I used to go here a lot when I was a beat officer many, many years ago. That Vienna beef dog, the hot sport pepper...man, my mouth is watering right now! The Italian beef and giardiniera also is the best you'll get ANYWHERE! I was never a big fan of french fries, but the fries here are addictive...just the right amount of salt and I love the skins being left on! After I retired, I was sad to see that they were gone form their original location on Liberty Ave near 7th, I didn't know that they moved to Market Square. I try to avoid downtown traffic like the plague, but now that I know Yovi's is back, it's worth the risk of a parking ticket! Hahahaha!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Pittsburgh. The inside is nothing fancy, but I think that actually adds to the experience. Nothing but great food and Lee the owner is super friendly. I've tried just about everything on the menu but I keep going back to the Italian Beef, it is actually better than 99% of the beef sandwiches in Chicago."}
{"text":"This place was the most unexpectedly pleasant surprise of our trip to Pittsburgh so far. Always on the lookout for great dive restaurants, the exterior of this place, coupled with the great menu posted outside, really drew us in. Lee, behind the counter, was in a great mood and happy to help. The food...absolutely some of the best food we've had in town, maybe THE best. The tamale boat was incredible. Best tamale I've had in my life. Great sit down spot, authentic Chicago style hotdogs, altogether: a new favorite we will return to every chance we get!"}
{"text":"Great food, ordered the polish sausage. Came with cucumber, hot pepper, onion, mustard, tomato, relish. It was great, hot, and the place is very clean. The worker was kind and friendly! Fast service, tasted fresh. Fries are crispy perfection, and that is worth noting. No soggy lifeless fries here!
This \"hole-in-the-wall\" joint is worth it."}
{"text":"I continue to love this place and it's definitely in the lunch rotation!

Yovi's is a hidden treasure around the corner from Radio Shack on an entrance street to Market Square. The closest main road is Liberty. You enter the nondescript door and go DOWN the stairs to the RIGHT.

Don't let the old school non-frills dining room throw you off --- there's great food going on here.

As I've said in my past reviews, the Chicago Dog and Combo Beef and Sausage are my gotos here. The fries are delicious as well. The food is always hot, tasty, and fresh, and never disappoints. Grab an IBC rootbeer out of the coolers.

Everything is reasonably priced.

I bring my family here, my co-workers, and hopefully some people from Yelp too. 

The owners are very friendly, efficient, and always deliver great tasting food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the best lunch places in downtown. Was so glad to see them back. And right off Market Square? So convenient. Have always loved the Italian sausage w/hot peppers. Tried the Chicago dog today and it was also very good. And they have the best fries you'll ever have."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time today. My boyfriend kept talking about this hot dog place and I had to try one. It was AWESOME!  I had a \"Chicago\"  style hot dog. It had tomato, relish, mustard,  jalape√±o, and this prickle that tasted like they made it that day, and this beef dog on this soft poppy seed bun. I had a side of crispy homemade fries with just enough salt. Very friendly ppl own it from Shy Town. It was clean and comfortable  and. I\"d go back there anyday"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are cheap and delicious. The pizza puff is the real steal tho, flaky crust, sausage, cheese...it's like a gigantic gourmet version of a Torinos pizza roll but the size of a sandwich and for only like $2. Classic toppings, classic dogs, short wait, and friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Holy hotdog YUM! I've never been to Chicago, but this hot dog made me feel like I have! Fast Friendly service!"}
{"text":"This place was a breathe of fresh air to find. The hot dogs are fantastic; buns and toppings fresh; homemade fresh cut French fries hot and crispy; and the staff was very pleasant and friendly.

I had the Chicago dog and a plain dog with only relish and ketchup. Both were right on point. The fries......yummmmmm! A little small inside, but it served its purpose. In the mood for fresh fries and great hot dogs...got here for sure. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: small, hidden (Chicago style) hot dog shop in market square. 

I didn't even know this place existed for the longest time. You hear about overrated Franktuary right down the street, but no one ever talks about Yovi's. Yovi's isn't anything fancy and it offers the classic toppings, served with fries if you want. It's pretty awesome to find a Chicago hot dog right in Pittsburgh. The owner is from Chicago so whether it's authentic or not, I can't tell you for sure, but it certainly seems to be. I've never had a Chicago dog but Yovi's version was delicious. I loved all the flavors of the relish, peppers and tomato which gave it such a fresh taste. Yovi's has a few other sandwiches on the menu that I'm sure are good too, but it's hard not getting a Chicago dog because where else can you find one in Pittsburgh?? This is a great place for a quick lunch and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of stopping in Yovi's for lunch today.  I have wanted to try their Italian Beef sandwich.  Yovi's is a small restaurant in Market Square underneath The Yard.  When I arrived it was around 11:45 on a Saturday and I was the only one there.  I believe it was the owner working behind the counter.  He was extremely friendly and engaging.

I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich meal which came with fresh cut fries and soft drink.  Everything was fantastic!  Fries and sandwich were great.  Restaurant looked very clean.  

This is a true hidden gem.  I'm anxious to return and try a hot dog or another Italian Beef sandwich.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Previously I posted a less than glowing review ( below) . Because the people at Yovi's are so nice, I went back to give them another chance. This time I ordered the natural casing dog extra- extra well done. It was a much different -- and better-- experience!  The hot dog was hot, juicy and the casing gave it its \"pop.\" The balance of the ingredients was much better this time  -- not too much of one thing and too little of another. The tomatoes were sliced,  there were three or four sport peppers, and the onions weren't piled on. I will definitely be back at least once a week for my Chicago fix!

First review:
I went to Yovi's today for lunch. I've been looking forward to it for long time - there are very few things in life I like as much as a great Chicago style hot dog! Unfortunately, I was disappointed.
The hotdogs were Vienna beef and the buns were poppyseed, just like they're supposed to be. But the hotdog was VERY small -- it didn't even fill the bun -- and not nearly cooked enough! There was one little sport pepper on my hotdog and too much onion. And the tomatoes were in wedges, not slices. It just wasn't a good representation.  You're supposed to feel a \"pop\" and some juiciness when you bite into it; not so with this. A great hotdog is supposed to overhang the bun, it's supposed to be hot and juicy. All of that was missing.  I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sitting on an alley (Graeme Street) on Market Square, this little hot Dog shop is a four step-walk-down harkening to the corner lunch place from the 60s (minus the racism). 

You walk in, and while it is clean, there is little flair to this establishment. The dogs are pried pretty well, although a combo gets a little pricier than I think jsut a dog and fries and drink should be. Still, it isn't in the expensive category at all. 

I wanted a dog with just mustard and made the mistake of ordering the \"Chicago Style Dog\" that was at the top of the list. This was on me, and it came with relish (very fresh) jalapenos, mustard and a pickle on it. 

The dog was underwhelming. Not too plump, and not hot. The bun was good, and the relish (though i scraped it off) was fresh and tasty, if i do say so myself. The Pickel, on the other hand, wasn't quite a pickle yet. It was somewhere between cucmber and pickle. Maybe that is how is is meant to be? I wouldn't say it was \"bad\" just \"not done soaking\" maybe. 

The guy behind the window was really nice and, even though i didn't ask for the combo, he threw in some fries (I'm assuming so i could try them.) 

So I don't know... I had a better hotdog from the cart on the sidewalk just a half block over on Liberty and Fifth, but they were super nice and you feel like you are in a big city going into this (almost literally) hole-in-the-wall place. 

Try it for yourself and see."}
{"text":"Like being in Chicago! Their Chicago dogs just like in Chicago! I wish they were in S Hills village food court! Every Time Im in city stop in for a Chicago dog"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on this one...

Decided to go here instead of Franktuary when a coworker suggested they had the better Chicago Style dog.  I had been meaning to stop by for a Hot Italian Beef sandwich, so I figured the dog would be a good litmus test for a future visit.

Yovi's is pretty small inside, just a counter with some bench stools and a few tables with two seats each.  Despite the size, I had to actually look for the window to order.

I ordered two Chicago dogs and they came out almost immediately.  While the steamed bun was on point,  the dog itself was bland and the toppings were mediocre...  while its the closest interpretation I've seen in PGH to the original, it just simply failed in execution.

On a positive note, my coworker let me try some of his fries and they were deadly good.  I'm assuming blanched then fried a second time given the thick crusty exterior and pretty smooth interior.  You can get some nacho cheese on the side and you're good to go.

Overall, I'll probably stop back at some other time to try the Italian Beef, but I was actually surprise by the price (over $6 for two simple hot dogs) and it was cash only (luckily I had some on me)."}
{"text":"I have worked downtown for over 4 years now and never noticed this place until a few weeks ago.

I was debating where to get lunch and decided to try here. (FYI- you enter through the same entrance as The Yard to get into the restaurant). I was surprised, it was a full house. I waited in line no more than 5 minutes and by the time the nice lady at the register handed me my drink, she was also handing me my food. Fries remind me of The O fries in Oakland, very good. Hot Dogs were also very good- real beef. 

If I wanted a hot dog while downtown, I would definitely come here over Franktuary. Everything is better."}
{"text":"I grew up on the south side of Chicago. Yovi's is absolutely the real deal. I heard about the place through, of all Pittsburgh things, a Rick Sebak instagram post. Trusting anything Rick says about sandwiches and hot dogs, I was hopeful.

When you walk into Yovi's, the first two things you see are a life-size photo of Mike Ditka and a Chicago skyline photo that takes up most of the wall. A good sign. Chicago sports memorabilia is everywhere. This, like any good Chicago hot dog joint, is a simple place too focused on the food to care about any other aesthetics. I was grinning from ear to ear the whole time I was in line.

I was so excited just from being there, but when the food was ready I found another level of bliss. I had a hot dog and an Italian beef with hot giardiniera, and both were a taste of Chicago. The hot dog had all the classic toppings, even down to the poppyseed bun and neon green relish. The beef was juicy, delicious, filling, and piled high on delicious bread. The fries were fresh-cut, with skin, and done to perfection. Not only did all of it taste like the real thing, they showed that Yovi's is as good or even better than a lot of places in Chicago itself.

I adore Pittsburgh, but it's always nice to have an authentic piece of my hometown to visit when the craving hits. Thank you for all of it, Yovi's. I look forward to many more happy lunches."}
{"text":"This is a reincarnation of Yovi's Little Bit of Chicago on Liberty Ave.  Several years ago, it was closed and Pittsburgh has been without this little gem for about 6 years.  Yovi's sells Chicago Style dogs along with some of the best french fries in the city.  The hotdogs are all beef and, if ordered Chicago Style, come on a poppy seed bun with chilis, rellish, pickle, tomato and onions.  It is kind of like having a salad with a hotdog for seasoning.  The restaurant is unassuming with limited seating.  The staff is friendly and helpful, but don't come for the ambiance, come for the fries!"}
{"text":"I love this place dearly. It's out of the way in scenic Market Square. There is very little in the way of evidence of a delicious Hot Dog place aside from a colorful sign in a window. Simply put, the food is excellent. The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable. Chicago Hot Dog? Absolutely. Fries? Yes indeed. Even the chicken breast sandwich is excellent. Get some cheese on the side, put some vinegar on the fries and have a short mouth party away from your soul crushing office job. Bring cash, because like all the best Pittsburgh places, they dont deal in plastics.

Yovi's. Come for the Chicago Style hot dogs, stay for the feeling of finding an underground treasure chest full of delicious wonder."}
{"text":"This is a cheap, old school type place that serves Chicago style hot dogs, wings, sausages, and baskets of chicken and fish. (I went to college there and can never resist a poppy seed bun or a Vienna beef hot dog!) The fries are to die for as well, and you can season them yourself with a variety of different spices. The space is on Market Square below the street level, tucked away near the Harris Grill. Stop in for lunch or a post-work snack, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place for some quick dinner on a late workday (subs and Mexican gets old after a while) and found Yovi's on the Downtown Pittsburgh website.  I thought it would be worth a try and it definitely was.

I had the two Chicago dog combo with fries and a Coke (relish, mustard, pickle, and tomato on one, relish and ketchup on the other).  The toppings were fresh and the buns were great.  The hot dogs were delicious.

The real winner is the fries.  I would have never expected a hot dog place to have such good  fries, but believe it, they are the best I've had downtown.  They have that fresh \"Potato Patch\" taste to them."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in market square I recommend
 the Italian beef!!!"}
{"text":"Came to explore Pittsburgh for the day and wanted some good local food. Took awhile for us to find this little gem (it is right next to The Yard). So happy we stopped here. I love Chicago style Hotdogs and this place has the best. Such a great little local place. Definitely worth the walk."}
{"text":"Yovi's is pretty fantastic for what it is. Great Chicago style hot dogs. Great Italian beef with the pepper mix. Excellent french fries. I've never had bad french fries with them.

The staff are always friendly and the place is pretty clean.

I alternate between the Italian Beef and the Chicago dogs. One day I'll pig out and get an Italian Beef and a Chicago dog and hate myself in the afternoon."}
{"text":"\"Livin' On A Poppyseed Bun\"

Yovi used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he was down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Now he works a diner all day
Serving hot dogs, Chicago all the way, they're yummy, so yummy

He said you've got to hold on to both sides of the bun
It doesn't make a difference if you order 2 or 1
But don't ask for ketchup, cause it's not done
That way...
These hot dogs are great!

Whoa, it's halfway eaten
Whoaho, it's like a veggie dog with meat on
Take my Sausage and put it in your mouth
Whoaho, this is what Chicago's about
Livin' On A Poppyseed Bun!

What to get: Chicago Dog, Polish Dog
What else: Whatever strikes your fancy
Speaking of strikes: The Union's been on strike. It's tough. So tough.

If a Chicago-style food restaurant is owned by Jon Bon Yovi, you know it's going to be good. I'd \"Runaway\" to Pittsburgh just so my prayers for real, delicious Chicago dogs would be answered. I've been \"Livin' On A Prayer\" of that sort for too long now. I know you have your fave hot dog spots in Buffalo, but \"You Give Hot Dogs A Bad Name\" when you suggest that they're as good as the Chicago dogs at Yovi's.

To get good Chicago-style food outside Chicago is a lot harder than it sounds. The vast majority of \"Chicago eateries\" outside Cook County are less \"Windy City\" and more \"Causes Wind.\" However, there are a few gems out there. Diamonds in the rough that are as good as anything in Chicago itself. And Yovi's is one of the most glittering of those diamonds.

What you must understand is that I'm obsessed with Chicago food. And I know it very well. Deep Dish Pizza isn't something Chicagoans really love. But if you want Pizza in Chicago it's Art Of Pizza (local) and Lou Malnati's (chain). There's only one Italian Beef *in the country* that I love. It's in the West Burbs of Chicago. Portillo's can go suck a lemon... it does nothing for me. For that reason, I've never even tried the Italian Beef here. However when it comes to Chicago Dogs and Polish Sausages, I start salivating and having tummy palpitations that have a distinct midwestern drawl and sound more like X than I care to admit.

There are quite a few good Chicago Dogs in Chi-town, but there are very few outside it. I can think of a couple in Atlanta, Nashville, one in Denver, Davenport... that's about all. Nothing else to write home about. Or write on Yelp about, I should say. However, Pittsburgh has one of the very best not-in-Chicago Chicago dogs you'll ever try. It's so good, that were it in Chicago, it would still be one of my top 10 places to get a Chicago dog, along with the likes of Fat Johnnie's and Kim & Carlo's.

The decor is extremely fun and Chicagoan. The products here are cheap and wonderful. The hours are limited (basically lunch-centric) but then it's in downtown, and hidden inside a basement, so that goes with the territory. I eat here literally every time I'm down in the Pitts. After filling up on dogs, drive up to Grandview Ave for the very best view of not just Pitt, but perhaps the best urban view in the country.

But back to the dogs... if you're in Pittsburgh and haven't tried Yovi's, you're really, really missing out. Get over here.

You won't have to go to Yovi's alone. \"I'll Be There For You\", these 5 words I swear to you. When you breathe, I wanna give a hot dog to you. And if other Chicago dogs you've tried taste more like \"Bad Medicine\", then you need to come here and try this one. 

What a Chicago dog is, for the uninitiated, is basically a delicious IL-made dog on a steamed bun, with all sorts of pickles and sport peppers and onions and relish and mustard and tomatoes... it's basically been dragged through a Midwestern farm and has \"all the veggies.\" It tastes remarkably spectacular. It's not sugary sweet at all, so don't ask for ketchup. Not only will that ruin it, but it's offensive to native Chicagoans.

You won't get a much better version of it - and the more smoky Polish version of it - than here at Yovi's. Come and try them for yourself. They're cheap and wonderful, and this is the easiest 5 star rating I've given out in Pitt since \"India On Wheels.\"

It never seems busy enough in here, and that's another case of people not knowing how good they have it until it's too late. One day they may close down, and Pitt may go back to only having D's 6 Packs & Dogs (a good but overpriced and unauthentic version of Chicago dogs) as the flag-bearer for this wonderful and underrated food style.

I hope they stay open forever, but if they ever do close, they'll go down in a \"Blaze Of Glory\" because I'll show up on their final day and buy every Chicago dog in the place. I have to \"Keep The Faith\" that when more people discover how good their dogs are, they'll become more popular. I know Chicago Dogs aren't really all that healthy, but \"It's My Life\" and I want to eat them."}
{"text":"We had two Chicago hot dogs, the standard stuff, together with fries. They tasted alright but nothing as much as hyped. I don't understand what the big deal is."}
{"text":"Simply the best hot dogs in downtown! Their combos and chicago style hot dog are the best. Nice friendly folks. Although you can try out different toppings, i personally like the chili toppin."}
{"text":"I don't often crave hot dogs unless i'm tailgating at a baseball game, or sitting around a campfire cooking dogs on the fire, but after having Yovi's my mindset has changed! This is as authentic as it gets to a Chicago dog. The owner is from Chicago, and when you walk in you feel like you're steps away from Wrigley with all the Cubs and Chicago memorabilia.

My go to sandwich here is the Combo (Italian Beef and Vienna Sausage) with peppers on top. The flavors that come with every bite of this sandwich is to die for. Highly recommend the Chili cheese dogs as well if you're looking for just a standard dog! The french fries are also DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, Yovi's is hidden in a basement in Market Square. I almost gave up on getting here when Google Maps led me astray, but Yelp has the right address.

I was sick of being at work so I decided to go get a hot dog snack. When I walked in, I did think the prices were a bit high. Basically, you can get whatever you want on your hot dog, but they are all $3.19 without tax. The hot dogs are regular sized but served on a Sesame seed bun.  I decided on a Chili Cheese Hotdog ($3.65 w tax). The cheese was nice and hot and the chili was good too.  The chili is mild, if that is a concern.  I gobbled the whole thing down in two minutes.

The guy who took my order was so friendly that it almost shocked me. I will end up coming back to try a Chicago dog just because he was so nice!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience at Yovi's today. I assume the man that took my order was the owner. Extremely nice and even offered me a holiday shot:)
   The food was fantastic as well. The French fries were some of the best I've ever had, and the Chicago dog was also very good (very authentic presentation). However, the real star of my meal was the Italian beef sandwich with Giardiniera. The bread was perfect, beef tender and super flavorful. All in all, a fantastic sandwich.  
   I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and I've walked by here numerous times, so glad I finally tried it out. I'll definitely be back, maybe not tomorrow, but probably the next day:)"}
{"text":"This is my first review that is under 4 stars.  But do not be alarmed, sole person who reads this.
I'm firmly in the \"if you don't have anything good to say, don't say it\" camp when it comes to reviews.  And there's some good stuff to talk about with Yovi's, and realistically, this is a 3.5 star review...but Yelp refuses to acknowledge my need for fractions.
Yovi's Chicago Style Hot Dog's....that's about as completely honest a restaurant name as you can get.  They do hot dogs.  Chicago style.  And some other stuff.  But you're not there for the tamale...unless you are.  But you're a weird guy to look for tamales at a hot dog shop that makes no mention of tamales in their name.  Freak.

For those new to the game, Chicago style, or stizz-ile if you're Canadian and ten years in the past, is an all beef dog, mustard, diced onions, electric green relish, \"sport peppers,\" tomato slices, celery salt, and a pickle spear, all squeezed into a poppy seed bun.  It's called \"run through the garden\" for a reason.

Now, I'm a bit picky when it comes to hot dogs.  And this isn't a bad one.  But Pittsburgh is quickly becoming a Hot Dog Mecca, with places like Packs N' Dogs, Franktuary, Station Street Hot Dogs, and even the Rowdy Buck on Carson Street is getting into the mix.  So, a good dog doesn't quite live up to a 4 star rating.

The all beef frank was solid, but nothing special, and all the toppings were fresh and tasty, but fairly pedestrian.  And for around $8 you get a 2 dog combo, with fries and a drink.  You'll be full, but you won't be chomping at the bit to come back.  I think the biggest problem, for me at least, was that the poppy seed bun was a let down.  Less of the Chicago original, and more of a Giant Eagle bun with some seeds on it.  

I'm not hating on Yovi's.  It was a good deal, really good fries, and a good dog.  All the Chicago nostalgia on the walls was like stepping through the looking glass in comparison to the \"all Pittsburgh all the time\" that is the norm in the city.  But next time, I might try the tamale."}

{"text":"I just started working downtown this week and had a hankering for a hot dog.  I searched Yelp and low and behold this place was good and nearby....you have to be looking to find it as the sign is a paper sign in a basement wondow....go down some steps to a hidden place with an aesthetic similar to an old diner.    I went on and ordered my dog, lots of toppings...way beyond your average Sheetz giving a true Chicago style dog.  I got a dog and some fries and both were spectacular...the peppers had great flavor on the dog and the bun even had poppy seeds.  The fries were good as well not being the stock frozen bag fries they had great flavor and they give you a lot for the money.    

If you are downtown looking for a great dog you could do a lot worse....it's hidden in market square but worth finding this gem"}
{"text":"Best Chicago dogs in Pittsburgh. Great, quick spot for lunch downtown, but it is cash only so be prepared. Along with the Chicago dogs, the fries are fantastic especially with a little season salt!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've worked downtown for years and never knew about this place.  It's a great little place to get good food fast - at an incredible price.

The owner is always there and makes sure his customers are fed a true gem of a hotdog and the best French fries in the world quickly. It's small but I drive over three hours once a year to get a taste. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little place down in a basement.... Well actually it's a garden level spot in Market Square.  The kids had a field trip to the theater so we park nearby and stopped in for a quick bite. Not only was the hot dog great ( got the Chicago style) but they treated my kids really well. Kids had a hot dog each, fries that looked hand cut and cheese. The service was quick... you can not really much better for a hot dog place.  Lots of charm and lots of Chicago influence. Cheap too!! Great place for a quick bite!!"}

{"text":"Boom Diggity!!!  Yovi's dog is tasty!! I was strolling through market square at 1045 AM with a mean craving for some tube steaks.  I decided to get a Chicago Style Hot Dog.  Never had one before, so my hopes were high.  I ordered their polish combo with fries.  First off, the fries were fresh cut and delicious.  I would come back for just the fries alone.  Then the hotdog was the best I've had in... forever.  The bun / frank / and toppings were spot on.   I will be returning to this hidden hotdog paradise."}
{"text":"I do love their food, but just don't eat there!  We were one of the first customers yesterday.  Sat at the tables, and they were sticky !!

My first time sitting at table and using restroom... kinda changed my mind now."}

Hand cut, Idaho potatoes served in a clean and super friendly environment.  This restaurant embraces Pittsburgh and the friendly owner made us feel like family. He even came and sat to chat with us while we ate. Nice meeting you Lee!"}
{"text":"Paul used to have an office downtown and his major regret in giving it up is that he is no longer a block away from this delicious lunch spot. We've never been to Chicago, but if it's half as good as Yovi's, we need to move there immediately. The owner and his girlfriend are delightful and the food is top notch. Paul is a sucker for the Chicago style beef sandwich. K likes the Chicago dog and the cheese fries are melty, salty perfection. Cash only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"best hot dogs ever!!! greatest guy ever!!!! must try such an amazing place. It is such a classic atmosphere and not a place like it in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This is Chicago to a T. Friendly service, good prices, and a perfectly authentic dog right down to the steamed bun and the celery salt. The Vienna beef memorabilia and chicago sports collection doesn't hurt either. But what impressed me the most is Yovi's does more than just replicate a good Chicago dog, it serves up some delicious fries - a must have during a rough day. If you like the city of broad shoulders visit this oasis in the city of steel."}
{"text":"Food is really good and so is the service. I was referred here for authentic Chicago Hot Dogs and they did not disappoint. My Chicago friend stops here just about every day lol"}
{"text":"Wandered in from a freezing night at the Winter Festival in Market Square. We were greeted like old friends (and in fact, my husband has been a Yovi's patron for many years.) the food is fresh and delicious and quick to the table with a smile. I had the chili dogs and fries, and my hubs had the Chicago Dog- specialty of the house. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I remember years ago when they were on Liberty and we'd often lunch at that location as students at AIP (when the school was still on Penn). It makes me happy they Yovi's still exists and that the food has stood the test of time. I've been to Chicago on multiple occasions and can say with certainty that they've got it down pat when it comes to authenticity.
I like making my own concoctions. For example I've been known to order a dog with cheese, peppers, pickles, tomato and onion. Add a side of fries and I'm on a hotdog merry-go-round of zing and taste!"}
{"text":"Very good Chicago style dog with all the fixins.
Excellent fries too.
Italian beef is ok, but not great."}
{"text":"The price is right and you get really friendly service by the owner . Very nice selection and the service comes with a smile! Love it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go in multiple times a week (probably 2 or 3 times). The sweet woman working the counter knows my order by heart, it's cheap, it's filling, sure isn't the healthiest but whatever. It's worth it."}
{"text":"You'd walk right be if you weren't looking for Pittsburgh's best kept hot dog secret. Ordered food to go for lunch and it was ready to go in less than 2 minutes. The fries somehow magically don't get soggy and are always delicious. Chili and cheese is my favorite of the hot dog toppings but you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"Love that Yovi's is back! And so close to work, downtown. Awesome, authentic, Chicago-style dogs (described appropriately throughout this profile), and fresh-cut fries...awesome. So glad he's back, and love to support this small, independently-owned business, rather than some chain. Cheers!"}
