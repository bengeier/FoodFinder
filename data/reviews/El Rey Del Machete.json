{"text":"This place took over the Le Flor De Michocan and the food is Bomb!!! So anything you get there is fresh made."}
{"text":"My moms machete came with overwhelming onion, and when she asked if they could make another or just to make it right for her they told her that that's how they come."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to where I live! The food here is amazing!! Best machete I've ever tried. The carne asada is so flavorful. Their flautas and pambazos are also delicious. I wish they catered parties because this food is the best mexican food in town. The ice cream shop located inside is also tasty so that just makes going in even better ."}
