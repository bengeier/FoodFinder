{"text":"Omg!!! The best light and tasty pizza ever.... after 3 pieces I want another one.... it was worth the drive!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of pizza. I judge a lot of pizza. Aside from a few exemplary places, Montreal is crap for pizza. We know this. I spent two years learning to make proper pizza because Montreal has such crap pizza.   Redi pizza is effin' amazing. They proof their dough for three days. Nonna pizza. Do some research and understand how that makes it so much more pleasant and eatable. The sauce is proper and simple. It is made with care and love and you can taste it. This, in my extremely picky opinion, is one of the best pizzas in Montreal. While that might be easy to say in this bog of crappy pizza in this city, I would say it's one of the best pizzas I've had in years. I'm a regular now. Better than mine... and I'm a cocky guy."}
{"text":"Bon! Enfin j'y suis allée! Redipizza n'est qu'à quelques minutes de la maison et à chaque fois que je les vois publier une délicieuse photo sur Instagram je me dis que je dois y aller, mais finalement j'y vais jamais. Bein là c'est fait. Check!  Et vraiment, j'ai beaucoup aimé! Premièrement, ce sont des pizzas épaisses et carrées, ce qui selon moi est la vraie version italienne (c'est subjectif!). Deuxièmement, il y a un grand choix de pizzas: végé, saucisses, zucchini, aux patates, Grecque, tomates, prosciutto/roquette, mozzarella, caprese, ect. au moins 14-16 choix! Le seul point négatif d'avoir autant de possibilités, c'est que le choix est vraiment plus difficile! Finalement, j'ai choisi 4 différentes sortes pour emporter. Je ne les ai donc pas fait réchauffer sur place, mais le proprio, tout souriant à la caisse m'a bien indiqué comment les faire chauffer à la maison. Ces instructions étaient très claires et sa pizza vraiment délicieuse.  L'endroit est très propre, il y a une bonne quantité de tables et le service est très sympathique et professionnel. Le décor est très épuré.   À essayer si vous êtes dans le coin!"}
{"text":"Was looking in Yelp for a coffee spot and landed in this cool pizzeria.  Judging from the decor, it hasn't opened for a very long time. Looks really clean and spacious.  They have many kinds of pizza available...not the kind you are used to like the New York style. Their pizza is in a square shape and topping tend to have more Veges which is good. The dough is more like a crispy bread which I love.  Pricing tend to be more expensive I would say but quality of ingredients used is noticeable.  Oh yeah...coffee is also very good :)"}
{"text":"So I noticed a new pizza place open up in the neighborhood a few weeks ago, and figured big deal, ANOTHER pizza place in Lasalle.  Boy was I wrong. This place is way different than anything I have ever had before, and It's pretty great.  The guy behind the counter told me it's \"roman\" style pizza from Italy. They make big sheets of pizza and sell it by the slice, so it's \"ready\" to go... The closest thing I have had before would be focaccia, but this crust is more like a really good baguette. It's hard to describe, but It was really great.  I tried 2 varieties: Italian sausage which was pretty good, and smoked salmon which was a real knockout. The best part was that each slice was under 5$ and frankly 1 was already plenty of food.  The storefront is bright, modern and clean.  I'm Definitely going back."}
