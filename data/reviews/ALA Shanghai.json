{"text":"- Since it is an open concept environment.. it was very hot during the dinner.. (i.e. 35C outside today) with central air conditioner in the restaurant..
- Food - taste not bad.. but with small portion.. that we needed to re-order more food..
- Price - reasonable
- Overall less busy than the hwy 7 location"}
{"text":"First time came here. But it's not a good choice. Service is not good. We waited long time for our food. And price is also expensive for the food they served to us. Food taste is ok. However I was charged 10% tip without my permission. Even I have a uncomfortable experience here. I will not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Lady worker with a mole on her face. Will beg you for tips, if you don't tip what she considers \"enough\""}
{"text":"Very good braised beef soup with noodles!! Only$7.99 for a big bowl. The broth was so tasty and the beef was perfectly soft. The restaurant itself was clean and modern. The staff is not very attentive but were nice when taking my order. I will come back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday after a dr appointment. 

Lunch special was $4.99 (AND UP), so basically only 1 dish was 4.99 the rest was like $8.99. 

Ordered lunch special- salted chicken with vegetable rice (+$1) with hot and sour soup. My partner ordered a Dong Po Rou with preserved vegetables (pork belly fat was evenly distributed in the piece of meat...so good yet so fatty) with steamed rice and soup of the day.  

Taste was okay, but given the fact at this location, hidden upstairs all the way down the hall... I would probably just go for something quicker at the food court.  

The xiao long bao was meaty, and good portion size compared to other restaurant. Came with only 4 of them in a steam basket but they were juicy and flavorful. Not greasy. Pork used was medium fat. Dough wasn't the thinnest of all I had in my life, but it would consider a pass for me. 

Would I come back here on purpose? Not to be exactly because I can go to a closer location, better pricing and better quality Shanghainese food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Why is everybody complaining about the portion size and price?! I thought both were decent. Perhaps it's because I'm used to paying slightly more in Mississauga establishments?

My fave dishes were the braised beef noodle soup and the fried duck with buns. Their noodles are made from scratch offsite and they're tender and delicious. The buns are made in-house and are also tender and don't have a thick skin like the frozen store-bought kind. 

My only nit-picky comment is about their chairs...time to replace some of them! My chair had weird bleach and possibly old sauce stains."}
{"text":"Take out $11.99 + tax for a sparse amount of sweet and sour fish when the man told me it would be a large portion. See photo, you can see the bottom of the container. Fish was mostly batter and tough to chew on. Service was fast but they weren't cooking much. 

Would I come here again? Not a chance."}
{"text":"Food is just average, certainly not very Shanghai but acceptable. However the service was really bad, every sigle server has a bad attitude. We asked for extra menu at the beginning and nothing came until we left. One of the server rolled eyes at me and has zero respect... pretty bad experience overall."}
{"text":"I don't give five star ratings often, but this place totally deserves it. The staff is very fast and incredibly patient and polite! The food is outstanding; I would recommend the Xiaolong Baozi, which are delicious dumplings with soup inside. The TangCu PaiGu (Sweet and sour ribs) are wonderfully caramelized and authentic, unlike the Americanized ones in other Chinese restaurants. It's a little pricey, but I say it's definitely worth it.
Please note that they don't take American credit cards! They'll take debit and cash at a 1:1 ratio, so to save money (depending on the current Canadian to US currency values) convert your US dollars to Canadian before coming here."}
{"text":"Easily the best Shanghai dinner and most expensive Shanghai restaurant I have been to throughout these years. Came here for my uncles birthday with the family. Space was very cramped and open concept was not the best idea in a Chinese mall lol.. The food was simply awesome.. Maybe I had too many drinks that night, but I don't recall complaining about a single dish.. Or maybe my only complaint was the food was too healthy lol needless to say, not disappointed with this decision.. Except the price LOL. It's not the most expensive, it was getting there though..

You must try! Food good, service awesome, price.. mehh, and open concept not a fan of.. Unless it's an English mall."}
{"text":"This was our first time being here and so far the servers are really friendly. The location is perfect on the upper level of pacific mall. Decor is simple yet classy. Very comfortable. My husband had the beef noodles (spicy). It was pretty good. I ordered the shanghai noodle being a shanghai restaurant it should be really good. And the verdict is ...it tastes pretty good..a bit salty for me but still good. We ordered dumplings and those were really good. Nice and hot. 

BTW they take only debit and cash. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Not the best and not the worst dim sum in Markham.  It's in Pacific Mall, which houses a lot of bad restaurants and food stands, so this one is the better option.  All red walls make for a unique ambiance.  The food is typical Shanghai dim sum of average quality."}
{"text":"ALA Kitchen has become one of my favourite restaurants for Shanghainese cuisine ever since I went to their main location near First Markham Place. The decor inside is very modern, open, vibrant , and welcoming with the bright colour selection for the restaurant.  The service was good, the waiters were friendly and attentive. 
The menu selection is very common of what you find in any Shanghai Chinese restaurant in Toronto. I would definitely recommend the Hot and Sour Soup, Shanghai Fried Noddles, Braised Beef Noodles in Soup, Drunken Chicken, Steamed Pork Dumplings, and Pan Fried Pork Dumplings.  
If you are looking for a change of taste from Cantonese cuisine, ALA Kitchen is a great place to have some authentic food from Shanghai ."}
{"text":"Nice healthy dim sum choice. The service was fast. The waitress was very pleasant with us. She was eating lunch, too. I'm sure that she was hungry, also, but she came over right away to give us our seats, give us menu, give us drinks, attend to us before taking our orders. After  that, she went to her lunch again. 

The food, hmmmm..., we ordered within soup, noodle with fried pork chop, and fried tofu. The wonton ingredients included pork and chives, I think. It was healthy and delicious. I loved it. The soup base was not too salty or msg-ish. The noodle and fried pork chops  it was great because the pork chop was not soaked in the noodle soup. The fried tofu, not my style, but it is just okay, if you like plain fried tofu, and dip it in soy sauce. Some people like it that way, so I cannot say if it's good or bad, just different taste, right? 

Overall, the decor was great. Located on the second floor of P. Mall, so who doesn't like it? Thank you Ala Shang Hai for the special lunch menu. Three dishes for $18 with tax."}
{"text":"I've been to other a a la shanghai and this one which is newer is absolutely terrible. the pricing, portion, and taste. this restaurant ruins the previous branch. I came to this restaurant, having tried the markham one, thinking that because they are the same name and same menu, that they would be similar in qualities since it is a branch.  however. The other one i gave 4 stars which is deserved, this one also earned its 1 star review. 

The beginning was the food the pan fried bun which is supposed to have filling, is just that. it is 90% bun and 10% filing, of which was not great in taste either. They really wanted to skimp out and save money i supposed since it is basically all dough. 

The next thing was the sweet and sour fish, it is overfried powder with very little fish involved, and on top of it the portion was absolutely inexcusably tiny for something that they charge 8.95 before tax. given that price range one should expect that decent average size, at least for what they term as a special. 

The steamed soup bun which has also wasn't very strong in the other restaurant, was bad in this one as well. it is overall dried out and overcooked. 

Overall the pricing, and portion, and taste does not do justice to its own branch restaurant in markham. 

I would recommend anyone who wants to try to avoid it, as it is not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a friend at lunch time on Monday. Maybe because it was during the Chinese new year, the restaurant was quite busy in the Monday afternoon. 

Me and my friend ordered steam crab and pork bun, and pan fried pork bun which are two signature Shanghai snacks, as well as sweet and sour fish and chicken soup noodle. The pan fried pork bun and the sweet and sour fish were disappointments. The sweet and sour fish is too overpriced for its tiny portion. it was $8.99 for around six seven pieces of fish only. In terms of the pan fries pork bun, the bun skin was too thick, with very little stuffing. However, I was very satisfied with the steam crab and pork bun and the chicken soup noodle. I really loved the soupy steam bun, the skin was thin but chewy, the stuffing tasted fresh sweet, and the soup inside the bun was not oily at all. Besides, the noodle was also great. It reminded me of the taste of grandma's cooking. The chicken soup was clear but rich in flavour. 

Overall, I think the restaurant is a good place to go for shanghai taste, though it is a little bit pricier than average compared to other similar type of restaurants. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends but will let them be aware of the small portion. Personally, if i go back again, it would be definitely because of their steam crab and pork bun!"}
{"text":"their main store is of a better standard. I ordered their vegetarian steamed dumpling. when it arrived, one can tell that it was re-steamed as the wrapping was yellow and tough. I am actually quite disappointed at this level of standard. I also ordered their famous fish and veggie soup. Sadly, it was disappointing. it was very watery.  traditionally, this soup is much thicker. I won't recommend anyone to this store anymore."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Shanghai restaurants I've been to in the Markham/GTA region recently.  It's tucked into the corner of the 2nd floor in Pacific Mall, so it's not the most easily found. They were giving out promotional flyers, so we ended up getting a free cold soy bean drink too!

We went there on a weekday night, and found the place nearly empty at around 6pm. We ended up having a xiao long bao, wontons in soup, dumplings, and a dessert of fluffy dumplings with red bean paste inside!

All the food was exceptionally well done, the skins were all very thin and none of them ripped apart as we were getting our portions.  The real highlight of the meal was really the dessert though.  We ended up ordering 4 for our party of 3, but it came with sugar (not icing sugar, unfortunately) on the top and it was still warm to the touch.  The doughnut was light and fluffy and the inside was really filled with the red bean paste! Definitely a wonderful way to end the meal!

Price is well worth the quality of food you get, and it's also about the same, if not less than other Shanghai restaurants.  We'll for sure be coming back here!

Caution though, we noticed a table getting their dessert, the doughnut/red bean paste first, and then their other food - definitely something to speak up about if that happens though!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: typical chinese restaurant

Food:
1. Chicken and vegetable noodle soup: the noodles were way over cooked, all choppy, same for the Bok Choy and chicken pieces. I would definitely NOT recommend this dish. 

2. Beef brisket noodles : this dish was definitely much better. Not the BEST I've had but the broth was well flavourful and was given a good amount of beef brisket. 

Overall: service wasn't too spectacular either. But I'll probably revisit, if in the area"}
{"text":"I'm been to Ala Kitchen on Fairburn and loved it, so we thought Ala Shang Hai should be pretty much equivalent to their counterpart.  Boy were we wrong...the food was pricey for what we got, it was salty and overall not tasty.  The hostess there weren't the brightest person either.  You have to tell them bring us tea, clear dishes off the table and refill tea.  Not attentive at all.  We would of been better off eating at the food court than pay premium to eat at Ala Shang Hai.  Never again will be return to this location."}
{"text":"A nice place to get dim sum and Chinese food in a corner of Pacific Mall. It is located on the second floor, and although it is 30 m away from the main food court area, the restaurant's exterior has a better vibe than the cheap food court storefronts.

The food tasted fresh, and it was in the authentic Chinese style I've come to expect. I was hoping the portion sizes should be a little bigger (maybe by 30%) at that price level, but I wasn't bothered.

About the waiters, they were understaffed on the Family Day holiday. I only saw 4 different faces, and oftentimes they were in the kitchen or otherwise invisible. Flagging down a waiter to get a kettle of tea or some small thing was difficult at times. Aside from that, I'd note that the waiters spoke Cantonese, so don't try to infer too much from the name \"Shanghai (cuisine)\"."}
{"text":"The food was so yummy! We had the shrimp dumplings and seafood rice, with some General Tao chicken! The service was amazing and the severs were really really nice! I had an amazing time dinning here and would definitely be back! ?????"}

price: it's average (50$ for four people)

rating: ****/*****

really good place, and I would come again; however, it's not over the top enough to get a five"}
{"text":"Horrible customer services. Do not take credit cards other than Canadian Debit cards. We are from US. Food also not very good."}
{"text":"Located on the second level of Pacific Mall, we were here for lunch this weekend.  Pretty decent, but nothing really stands out.  The jellyfish wasn't seasoned so it was sort of bland, the chicken with rice all day special combo dish was spicy eventhough it's not mentioned on the menu (and didn't look like it from the menu photo).  We were seated at the only available seat which was next to the open concept wall with little privacy.  They didn't give us the 2:30pm-5pm tea time special menu so we had to ask for it."}
{"text":"We can't? get enough of this place!  Only wish it was easier to get a reservation.  If you want to go during the busy times make sure you get a reservation or you will have a prolonged wait."}
{"text":"This place is pretty quiet in the afternoon so there's no need for waiting. The open space and walls of this place are pretty good because there's tons of natural lighting and very modern looking. They serve dim sum all day although it's a pretty small menu as it only contains Shanghai style specialties. Ranges from rice dishes to noodle dishes to dim sum. They also have a dinner menu as well. 

What I ordered:
Dim sum menu~
*beef roll: it very moderate. One of my go to dishes but the one they serve here has very little filling and sauce. But the taste and texture is still okay.

*pork pan fried Shanghai dumplings (bao): overall it was good. Very soft and the filling was tasty but kinda disappointed. Shanghai panfried bao IS supposed to be panfried while it's raw and panfried to perfection but this place (like many others), just steams it and then light pan fry it for the colour. 

*pork fried dumplings: probably one of my favourites from here. The dumplings were a good size and lots of filling. Tender and bit crispy at the same time. 

Noodle menu:
*fried ribs with noodle: the ribs were amazing. Texture was crunchy outside and meat was tender on inside. The seasoning was perfection! However, the noodle itself was bleh. The soup base tasted like nothing... felt like it was just water. But nothing a little chili oil can't fix! Warning tho.... that chili oil IS pretty strong..."}
{"text":"Food.
Taste - Mediocre. Portion - too Small. Price - Not worth it.

Service - unfriendly staff. They said Thank You, but not sincere. I waved my hand to get my waitress' attention to order an additional item. She refused to come over to my table, instead asked me what I wanted from a distance. 

Atmosphere - comfy because they were not busy. Less than 10 ppl there.

The bottom line is I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Ala Shang Hai is a bit overpriced, you are really paying for the nice seats and decor when you eat here. 

The food was alright. I liked their green onion pancake. The soup dumplings were standard, only 4 soup dumplings per order, which is pricier than average. The veggies were standard. We got beef mince congee which was a bit bland. I was also craving rice rolls, so we ordered one, but they were missing the pickled vegetable that makes rice rolls taste so good. Without the vegetable, it tasted very bland with just the rice, the fried dough, and the shredded pork. 

 The service is pretty standard for a Chinese restaurant - waitress that doesn't really care about you or look happy to be working there, difficult in getting other waitstaff attention when we need the bill or more tea. This was in the late afternoon (~2pm), so it was pretty dead - only 3 other tables to serve amongst 3 wait staff. We got a signature Shanghainese dessert which was a rice cake with fruit, not my cup of tea and it tasted a bit stale thinking back on it."}
{"text":"#VAPELIFE 

I've never eaten here before 2 pm & never after 6 pm !! I love it here during mid lunch service. First off , this is the finest looking establishment in the mall ! Excellent decor design , very sophisticated colors , high ceilings with plenty extra added ventilation fans with a wide open concept connected to the mall thus making this spot a beautiful Vape friendly location! This is gonna be my new spot , the washrooms are unisex & oh so clean ! the service was very attentive & very friendly , but I don't know how they will be if they are busy , the food is LEGIT , the food has flavour , the portion size is perfect , not too small not too big , they have daily specials at different times of the day , you can order your fav Shanghai types of favourite dumplings , I usually order a braised beef (brisket) noodle & it's always been very tender! flavorful , I really love this place. It's clean , it's stylin , it's classy , it's got it's own panache , it's my type of resto !"}
{"text":"Great food, good portions and very reasonably priced.

I am a huge fan of the original location of Ala Shang Hai in Markham.. this is one of the only restaurants inside Pacific Mall and it is quite hidden. It is located on the 2nd floor at the very end of the hall of all the barbers/medical clinic.

The food is always consistently delicious. My must-get dishes are the thick Shanghai noodles and the Xiao long bao.

I love that this location is tucked away so it is nice and quiet. Another plus is that they have their own washrooms.. SO much cleaner than the other nasty ones they have in the basement."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Pacific mall and my in laws recommended to have lunch at a la Shang hai. We ordered our usuals from all other shanghainese restaurants. 

Xiao long baos (one crab meat and one pork) - dim sum portion? Each order only came with 4 pieces! Wished we ordered more! The skin and broth were spot on! Skin not too thick, not too thin. The broth was light and tasty. 

Pan fried dumplings - overstuffed with minced pork! The skin was perfectly pan fried. Be sure to ask for some black vinegar or hot sauce for dipping! 

Beef wraps - a bit underdressed. It can definitely use more hoisan sauce. The scallion pancake wrap was too dry and plain for my taste. Not on par to other shanghainese restaurants in gta I've been to. 

Braised pork belly - so much fat... My father in law loved it. But a mouthful of grease just isn't my thing. I cut out the leaner portion for a taste. Too chewy and  dry without the melt in your mouth fat. 

Beef noodle soup - yum the beef brisket was perfectly made! Juicy, tender, fell right apart in your mouth! Loved the texture of the house made noodle especially with all the broth each strand had soaked up! 

Shanghainese stir fried noodle - not overwhelmingly oily or salty! For once this dish didn't grease or salt me out. One of my fav of this meal! 

Garlic Dau Miu - the only veggie dish my brother in law would eat. A classic done well. Get this if you are looking for some greens to complement your meal! 

Fried Mantou with condensed milk - they pan fry one side rather than deep frying the whole bun. They also watered down the condensed milk. Overall It felt cheaply made, I recommend skipping. 

Overall - mostly good but nothing memorable enough to convince me to go out of my way for the food. I will probably stick to checking out the food court in this mall instead."}
{"text":"Because the dining room was full, they set us up at one of the outside portable tables. Since no one walks that far down to this cul-de-sac, that's not really a problem.
Being a \"temporary\" table, it is kind of funny watching their servers kept walking by all seven tables with food looking for a table to set them down at.
At $4.99, their apps are a little overvalued, but taste decent. The rest of their menu...the only thing we found good was the steamed dumplings. They were juicy and tasty; however, everything else were just greasy, and only treated average.
To say the least, this experiment was disappointing. I'm just glad that it was my wife who suggested it, and not one of the umpteenth time I asked to try this place.
I think we will stick with Asian Legend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family and it's your typical dim sum restaurant (paper and pencil, no push carts). Dishes came out fast but no stand outs and service was good."}
{"text":"Shanghai dumpling and sesame cake with minced pork was one of the best I've had. Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean. A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Ala Shang Hai inside Pacfic Mall is the newest venture of Ala Kitchen.

Open concept red and white theme, the deco is chic and modern. There is even a patio like area by the side.

Menu is really similar, with fewer selection than their first location but the service here is a lot better and friendlier.

The few items we ordered were well prepared.

????($4.99) Cucumber with Garlic Sauce
??????($8.25) Wonton and Chicken in Soup
?????($4.25) Steamed Pork Dumplings

A good choice for Shanghainese food if you are in Pacfic Mall!"}
{"text":"Mom and I needed a good lunch option at Market Village/PMall area.  I didn't feel like food court or subpar dim sum, so we walked past a long line of hair salons and beauty spas to arrive at ALa.  I liked that there was a lunch combo menu.  I just didn't see anything I like there.  I ended up ordering a salty rice roll ( ???), and a set of pork and leek dumplings.  Mom ordered a spicy tofu lunch combo.  I will give you the good part of the food first: the ingredients were fresh.  Unfortunately, it went downhill from here.  I hoped the salty rice roll had had more pork in the roll.  If too expensive, I would also take pickled vegetable.  But there was none, so I was stuck with an average rice roll (because the rice was good) with minimum flavour.  Kinda disappointing.  The dumplings gave me even less excitement.  Skin was too thick.  The pork inside was not flavoured enough.  Very insufficient leek. I almost want to not recommend it.  But then pork and leek dumpling is such a staple.  Mom's tofu was indeed spicy.  For $5, the portion was very generous.  

Kindly note that the seating was nice, the place was clean, and we got to use clean washroom.  These three are pretty rare at PMall."}
{"text":"What an unappreciated restaurant. This place is easily as good if not better than Asian Legend. The restaurant looks pretty modern, and the staff are actually friendly. Best of all, it's tucked away in a little corner on the second floor of Pacific Mall so we didn't have to wait for a table either on a Sunday night.

The food was very good and well above my expectations. The spicy braised beef noodles was one of the best I've had anywhere. The same could be said for the steamed pork dumplings and the pan fried pork dumplings as well. Heck, even the pan fried snow pea leaves were outstanding. The peking duck was pretty good as well, although I probably wouldn't order it again. I'd just order 2 bowls of the spicy braised beef noodles instead. The other two dishes we got were fine too- the baby bok choy and some tofu and mushroom dish that we'd never tried before."}
{"text":"Ok I came here for my aunts birthday and I have to say that their food is the bomb.  The place is clean and the service is good too. I would definitely come back. Check out my pics to see the dishes we ordered. =)"}
{"text":"came here for their lunch special \"4.99\" advertised .... wow.. presentation here straight up sucks.. theres really none.. they throw couple of manchu wok items in a bento box and called it a day..

on top of that it was not even consistent.. one of the other bentos was missing an orange slice."}
{"text":"Nice newer restaurant on second Floor of pacific mall. Service was disorganized, food came out sparingly and portions were small scomparse to the prices.  Having Said that the soup dumpling was really good. Some dishes were good while others needs improvement. Will come back to try other items."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at ALA Kitchen at First Markham Place so I was very excited to try this new location out. 

The good: Menu and prices are very similar to FMP location which is good because I've always found their prices to be reasonable. Prompt and friendly service. Food quality and ingredients are consistent with other location.

Bad: The location. PMall is notorious for parking on the weekends. Add in that it's tucked away quietly down the hallway on the 2nd floor barely anyone walks to, it'll be hard to attract customers. However, PMall has been lacking a good quality full service restaurant (I think the Korean and Viet restaurants are subpar, sorry), this will give consumers a different option for food."}
