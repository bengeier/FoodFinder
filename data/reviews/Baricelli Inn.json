{"text":"I had a couple of wonderful special occasion meals here years ago. I can still remember how wonderful the homemade pasta was, and how romantic and elegant the various dining rooms seemed. I was looking forward to our re-visit but in hindsight, we should have taken the fact that we were able to get a prime time reservation for 8 people on very short notice as the bad omen that it was and gone elsewhere. The first disappointment was the state of the restaurant. It's a bit dingy and tired-looking, with visible nicks and scratches on the paint and woodwork. What happened to the elegance? Still, I wouldn't have cared much if the food had lived up to past glories. Sadly, it didn't. Save for a bizarre scallop dish that attempted to marry Asian-style seasoning with lentils, nothing was terrible, but nothing was great, either. Plating was fairly careless, and dishes arrived at various temperatures. Our server was nice and did his best to be the consummate professional, but something was just off. At times, he would launch into detailed descriptions of things we hadn't asked about, almost as if we didn't know what fine dining was and had to be led through the experience. When I actually had a question (I wanted to know what the meats on the charcuterie plate were that night), he couldn't give me an answer beyond explaining what charcuterie is. Thanks, but I knew that! Same with the wine - he was able to recite textbook descriptions of various wines, but when it came to putting together a couple of recommendations all he could do was say that Chateauneuf-du-Pape would be an excellent choice. 

I see that this has turned into quite a rant, which I hadn't meant it to be. However, I was genuinely disappointed with our experience. This place was one of the kings of the Cleveland restaurant scene (and still has the reputation for being so), but at this point it's off my list."}
{"text":"Wow. Just, wow. (Go for the cheese platters if nothing else.) The chef cooks with intention. The dishes are thoughtful. If you need a night to reflect on why it's good to be on this planet with so much bounty, go here. 

In February, my husband had the chicken stuffed with apple sausage and I had a pasta dish. Seasonally appropriate, well prepared, a rainbow of offerings for the palette."}
{"text":"Okay, I know it's a Cleveland landmark. I know it's an award-winning restaurant. And I get the whole nouvelle-cusine thing. Why heck, I've even dined in Italy  (and in most countries in Europe so I get the smaller- portion-Americans-eat-like-pigs thing.) But this place is so over-rated and over-priced it's ridiculous. 

Went there with two other couples. Each couple ended up coughing up $150. Okay, we did have three bottles of wine, but come on. My soup was about a buck a spoonful. Served in a gigantic bowl with wings, it cost $9.00 I don't think there were even nine spoonfuls, in fact, I think a Dixie bathroom cup holds more fluid.

Next my entre.  Being a delicate flower, I ordered the small portion of ravioli. THREE PIECES for $11.  Seriously. And it wasn't even that good. If it were orgasmically good, I could deal with it. But I've had better (and more!) and way cheaper.  My husband and I were so hungry when we got home, that we each wolfed down a bowl of cereal!!!

The cheese plate we ordered was wonderful. But they didn't make it.

At least I can say I've been there. There are so many other great places in Cleveland; I think it's safe to leave the Baricelli Inn off your \"1000 places to eat before you die\" list."}
{"text":"Cleveland not only has a better orchestra than the Titannic, the food at the Baricelli Inn is probably as good as anything the swells in First Class were swilling.  This is a beautiful restaurant and Inn at the top of Cleveland's Little Italy neighborhood adjacent to Cleveland Heights and the University Circle complex which houses Case Western Reserve University, Severance Hall and the world renowned Cleveland Orchestra, and the fantastic Cleveland Museum of Art.  My one experience here had me savoring every bite of a succulent osso bucco with a creamy rissotto and a lovely, perfect reduction--a little different from the traditional osso bucco but one I'll remember probably forever.   My companions enjoyed a pasta dish that I found tasty but perhaps a bit simple for the price.  Sometime I'll tell you about a less memorable visit to Little Italy when a friend's New Year's party was stormed by the neighborhood youth center denizens because there were people of color in the party!"}
{"text":"The Inn:  My favorite part of the inn isn't actually the room itself.  It is the staircase past the kitchen.  There's a little nook that retains the heat of the kitchen and the wonderful aroma of whatever is cooking.  YUM (if you are into that kind of sensory experience)!!!

The room:  #4.  The key sticks.  The TV is old, old.  The sheets are nice and the four-post bed is delightfully high.  A golden box of 2 chocolates waited for us on a plate with a doily.  Love the coconut/lime/verbena bath products (Bath and Body Works).

The restaurant:  AMAZING.  You must, must, must check out the cheese fridge.  There must be 2 dozen + cheeses that will drive you crazy.  You can get the cheese plate in 3, 5, or 7 increments.  I was amazed by L'Espalier a few days ago, but Baricelli Inn's cheese plate blew me away.  Flawless grapes and a wonderful selection of cheeses, from runny to solid.  Nothing calcified, but that's OK.  The VA Appalachian jack was a bit overpowered by the other soft cheeses.  No worries.  I'm a sucker for fresh figs and the fig cake.  The only other compliment to that would be the honeyed orange marmalade that they served with last night's dessert special - chocolate dome with a hint of basil paired with a lemon bar.  The instructions were to eat the chocolate dome and while the last bit of chocolate was in your mouth, take a bite of the lemon bar.  The only little complaint was that the honeyed orange confection detracted from the sharpness of the lemon bar.  I'm all about the citrus shock factor."}
{"text":"The Inn was quaint and charming like a stay at your grandmothers house. I give it four stars, not all five because the housekeeping crew was vacuuming the hallways at 5am...if you know that the rooms are old fashion and not insulated for sound, why would you vacuum the hallway first thing in the morning?

The restaurant, well, not so good. The \"nouvelle cuisine\" tasted a bit amateur.  My pasta was so incredibly salty, like salt lick salty, drink two glasses of water at once salty. While my boyfriend's pasta was swimming in oil and generally over seasoned.
Later when talking to a local about the place, they mentioned that the only reason people go here is because of the great selection of cheeses. 

Well, at least the salad was good.
Also, expect slow service."}
{"text":"I heard this restaurant used to be one of the most expensive places in town, but since coming under new management, the prices have been adjusted from insane to a reasonable level of expensive.  My brother had taken a cooking class that toured the restaurant, and suggested the place for dinner.

It was a superb meal.  We both ended up ordering the seared duck breast with pumpkin spaetzle and fig.  The duck was perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned, the spaetzle were light and tasty, the sauces flavorful.

For dessert, I had apple cobbler with peppercorn pancetta ice cream, cheese (Camembert, if I recall correctly?) was baked into the biscuit in the cobbler and all the flavors / textures / temperatures worked together perfectly.  My brother had the homemade sorbet, and I can verify that was quite delicious as well.  We ordered cappuccino with our dessert and each received an excellent cup, presented just right, with sticks of rock sugar to stir.

I'm really glad I had the opportunity to dine at the Inn.  This Little Italy landmark should not be missed."}
