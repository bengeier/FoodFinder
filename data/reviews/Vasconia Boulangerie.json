{"text":"Just discovered this gem nearby. Colombian coffee and food, along with some great pastries, cookies, etc. I had some empanadas and a mango juice (freshly made) and they were great. The ambiance feels a little like those Illy cafes with a latin vibe. I  don't think it's meant to be the kind of sit and relax all day with a laptop kind of cafe - but that's okay. Wifi available though, so if you've got a good battery you'll be set. Will definitely come by again."}
{"text":"Cold arepas. Very bad service. Feeling like I'm bothering. 1.50$ for a very small scoop of guac. Owner unpleasant. Kind of restaurant who leaves you standing at counter without communication."}
{"text":"i always get the gluten free corn bread there's a sweet version and savoury, quality is consistant will try the mille feuille and tres leches next. Had a bowl of the beans avocado etc wasn't impressive."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. I often go for the pastries, they have delicious almond and chocolate croissants. The brownie and the \"mille-feuille\" are also excellent. I recently tried their lunch menu and it was delicious! I had a typical Colombian dish and it was delightful, full of fresh flavours. I recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
