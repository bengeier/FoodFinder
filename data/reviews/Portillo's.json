{"text":"Just like Chicago! I have gone about 5x in the past week and a half its been open. Amazing Italian Beef, the chocolate cake shake is to die for, the staff seems to work really hard at making sure your order is correct and its as fast as they can go. The atmosphere seems cool too, nice decorations throughout. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered two fish sandwiches, one grilled tuna and one grilled halibut.  Both came out as soggy messes.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is probaly my go to place for food on the go. i love the cheese fries. the burger are cooked to perfection. and the milksaheks are nice and creamy."}
{"text":"I have been to COUNTLESS portillos in the Chicagoland area and NEVER in my life have I ever been so disgusted or disappointed with an establishment. Half way through eating my hotdog, I saw a dead fly fall onto the wrapper straight out of my MF hotdog. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I LOVE Portillos! I've been to Portillos all over the Chicago area throughout my entire life, and this one is right on par with all of the others (of course). The employees are super nice, the drive thru moves quickly, and the food is outstanding. They even gave my dog a treat when she was in the back seat of my car in the drive thru last week! I will always and forever love 'tillos. My favorites are the chopped salad, Chicago style hot dog (straight up), the cheeseburgers, the beef sandwich dipped with hot peppers, the fries, and the chocolate cake. Portillos can you cater my wedding? Seriously"}
{"text":"Went there with my Wingman and I had the chili cheese dog. It was excellent. Really busy but we were waited on quickly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I kept my Google review short...this one is going to be a rant.   I've been going to Portillo's for as long as I can remember. There was one  about 2 miles from where I grew up. The service at this location tonight was this Portillo's was the worst experience I've had at a Portillo's in my life.   I asked for some chili cheese dogs with onions. I added the with onions part  because I've been asked at other locations if I want onions on it. If it comes with onions, and I say I want onions on it, don't cut me off when ordering and repeat back something that I didn't say.    After waiting about 10 minutes for my food, they didn't give me my entire order. Gave me the cheese, but no fries, and the root beer, but no straw. This go through was petty,unprofessional, and more than likely my last at this location."}
{"text":"Good like in Chi so 5/5. Love their fries and dipped beef."}
{"text":"Hype. Sure.... but I like a good solid beef dipped and this spot delivers. I use to live in Chicago, and I honestly never cared much for Portillos because all the neighborhood Italian Beef spots were kinda better in my opinion. I still like to support my guys over at Super Niro's, but sometimes I just gotta hit Portillo's for it. Love the Cake Shake, the grilled Tuna Sandwich is an underrated hit for sure. I think it would be kinda dumb of you to ever go during peak hours, I hit the drive through, or take out, and find it's usually a 5 minute deal.  So yeah... do it if like it."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through at 10:40 this morning and it was a well oiled machine.  I was pleasantly surprised that my lunch was only $5.  I don't usually eat hot dogs but I had to find out what all the hype was about.  I ordered a Chicago Dog and fries.  I loved it!  Next time I will try the Italian Beef.  The employees working the drive through were so nice and helpful.  Thank you Portillio's for coming to Champaign and hiring so many people!"}
{"text":"It's Portillo's! What more do I need to say?! A Chicagoland classic right here in Champaign.  Shakes, Sodas, Burgers, Sandwiches, Salads, Fries and Ribs! The Strawberry Shortcake dessert is to die for! Portillo's is great for a grab and go or dine in!"}
{"text":"Good food, but absolute chaos in the drive through.  Please fix the madness!!"}
{"text":"I am a Portillo's fan from Chicago and have never seen a worse run Portillo's than this one.  While the food was great the service was horrible.  Trash cans were overflowing, tables were dirty and he entire place needed to be cleaned up.  Even worse was the service.  All the Portillo's I've been to in the Chicago area have snappy service.  They greet you when you come in, have a smile on their face and are constantly busy and watching out for the customer.  The staff here were busy talking behind the counter, ignoring the people who needed to be taken care of including my husband and son.  Their food was ready and no one announced their number.  They had to ask.   I also wanted chocolate cake and stood at the dessert area for well over ten minutes. While there were people back there NOT ONE looked at me or asked me if I needed help.  They were doing busy work or talking to each other.    I won't go back there again.  I'll save my Portillo's experiences for Chicago.  Portillo's upper management needs to go and check this one out.  They are giving the chain a bad name"}
{"text":"Service is good. Food honestly is cheap compared to most places in Champaign. Personally the food is nothing to write about because it was average. I would probably not go again."}
{"text":"Delicious and meets all your expectations of Portillo's in Chicago!  Having grown up and currently living in Chicago, I have frequented many Portillo's across the city and the Chicagoland area. It is pretty surprising to me how consistent they are across all their locations. Champaign was no different. While I unfortunately did not get to go inside because of the packed parking lot, I was able to order my regular go-to items through drive-thru in a fairly timely manner. On my trip here, I got the classic Chicago hot dog with everything, the Maxwell street polish, Italian beef sandwich with peppers, and, an absolute must, the cheese fries. I don't know what they add to their cheese sauce but it is crazy good. Overall, from placing the order to getting our food, it took about 20 minutes, which is not terrible, especially for a Saturday afternoon.  Pro tip: Know what you're getting before you pull into the drive-thru lane as they can take your order well before you get to the menu board."}
{"text":"Worst customer service.  We were under the impression they accepted apple pay as a form of payment. Google maps and one of the Chicago locations confirmed this before we headed there.  The manager Matt was rude, cocky, and a smart ass. He wanted us to come to the bar to show them how to use Apple Pay.  We didn't want to go inside because my daughter was injured and I wasn't dressed app with outdoor shoes.  Matt got frustrated lifting his hands up saying I'm done! We tried to explain how to use it. Then here cones Mike, telling us to leave if we didn't have another form of payment. Then told someone to call the police.  Corporate office called me today and  from Oak Brook and was just as rude to me and unhelpful.  I will never spend another dollar at any location.  We have have been regular for years."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything bad from here. It's all good . Had the Italian beef with liquid cheese. I had the rib meal and it was delicious! The deserts are to die for with creamy chocolate cake for you chocolate lovers and amazing strawberry shortcake with real strawberries for fruit lovers like me. While this place is a little pricey, I don't mind paying as it takes me back to my hometown of Chicago whenever I take a bite. Try this place soon. Perfection. Pick up or dine in only. The drive thru process is the worst I have ever seen."}
{"text":"bland overpriced food.  Plenty of other places to eat that are much better priced and with much better food.  I got the hot dog which tasted like someone boiled it, and fries that didn't taste any better than what I could buy at War-Mart.  I also got a pasta salad which was bland, and a drink.  I ended up paying over $10 for very bland for after waiting in line for a good 20 minutes for my order to come, and I think ill just stay away from this overrated place."}
{"text":"This place is just a blast, I admit I love Chicago but they have a great system to get your food to you, great dogs burgers and Italian beef. Not crazy about the chili but wife says salads are very good. Lines move fast and nice prices"}
{"text":"Honestly i don't get it.  I had a chopped chicken Salad from Portillo's in Deerfield, IL today.  Drive through line out the parking lot but I had ordered on line and picked up inside, very efficient and nice staff.  The food however is another story.  The chicken is horrible, must be processed, it was very spongy and odd tasting.  The Gorgonzola cheese was hard as a rock,  the onions were really strong and the dressing, honestly, greasy and not that good tasting.  Couldn't even finish it.  I do not get the crowds.  I guess there beef is better?"}
{"text":"Tried out this location and it did not disappoint! Great atmosphere and was really busy! Our food order came out hot and correct!  Love the hot dogs, cheese fries, and Chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"Hot Dog skinny, and not cooked!  Barely warm! French Fries and onion rings might have been ok, but they were cold! Italian beef is beef, but no seasoning. We ate our food immediately, not drive up...so no excuse for cold food! Decor is very fun and interesting."}
{"text":"Came here for the \"soft opening\" with a few friends. Boys and girls, let me tell you, it was not really a \"soft\" opening - it was busting at the seams, and we were worried that we would be in line for a while. One of my friends had a prior engagement, so she was worried that she wouldn't be able to get her food. However, the line was moving pretty quickly and we got our food in less than 30 minutes considering there was a line that circled around inside the building twice on top of a line outside. Unfortunately, my friend was unable to get her food after the employee wrote down her order on a paper bag, but they were accommodating that day and let us order for her when we got to the register.  I wasn't too hungry, so I got a hot dog without pickles and small fries with cheese (it's really a crime to get their fries without the cheese). Even though it's not really the craziest thing you can get in Portillo's, I was pretty satisfied with it. The employees were fantastic and even offered to clean our table for us when we were done. Great place, and would definitely come back again if I'm not already moved out. I'm coming back for you, strawberry malt."}
{"text":"Basically had a religious experience here. The drive through despite the line out onto the street was efficient. Couldn't have been more than 10 minutes and we were happily eating (almost inhaled) hot dogs and working on splitting the Italian beef. Like everyone else said the chocolate Cake is good but we forgot to get that. Also French fries with cheese are good too.   Honestly it's amazing the food is to die for and the experience went really well."}
{"text":"I've always kept a special place in my heart for Portillo's, and was thrilled to hear there was one opening up this fall! The food was great but the service is not as fast as it usually is. Definitely go with some time to spare, they seem to still be training a lot of staff."}
{"text":"Fantastic.   Guests with golden tickets today.  Love love love.  I hope it's one if the best locations since it's closer than Chicago for us.  Can not wait to go back and try the lemon cake.   Never ever had a bad meal at any location.  Staff always seem to be happy also.   Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"These hot dogs are so addicting. I get the portillos dog (Chicago dog) and the chilli dog no onions. Sooooo good. I'm a big man I could eat 6 of these. And I'm so hungry right now I might."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere, delicious food, nice staff, and the best Italian Beef EVER. Seriously. Get both sweet and hot peppers on yours.  Sometimes they are overwhelmed in lunch hours, which slows things down, but also an indication of their quality."}
{"text":"The big city to the north has arrived in Blo-No with the opening of this restaurant.  A well known Chicago-Style fast food Italian place.  All sounds good right?  But wait,  along with the restaurant came the rude and bossy employees of the big city.  I have eaten in every new establishment that the twin cities has opened in the last 20 years and have never encountered these people that are employed here,  where did they come from? Were they imported with the new restaurant?  THEY ARE PUSHY, LAZY, AND RUDE.  Now to the food, Very salty,  the fries are just run of the mill frozen fare, and did I say very salty.  The beef sandwiches are the highlight of this place but again have a big bottle of water with you in the car because after eating you'll need in the rehydrate from the heavy salt dose. Sometimes the beef sandwich rolls are almost unedible because of the overdipping in the ajus,  this is hap hazard no matter how wet  you order the sandwich.  The hot dogs are really nothing to brag about, the toppings on the Chicago hot dog are good but what disappoints is the tasteless skinny wiener.  The Maxwell polish is not bad but is served on a tiny hot dog bun with the sausage hanging out both ends,  hard to eat in this flimsy bun.  The halibut fish sandwich is just a tasteless frozen block don't waste your money even trying this item.  All in all you are  better of going to McDonalds for your fast food fix.  Did I mention the rude employees,  most of which  come across as being mad at even being there and acting as if they have a chip on their shoulder because they have to work.  The workers for the most part move very slowly so don't get excited if you have a long wait for your order.  I have been here 7 times since the grand opening and I do not see any improvement in quality or efficiency of the service.   Will I return, yes,  I'll keep you updated, especially if there is and improvement in staff."}
{"text":"Went to Portillo's today with my brother and was just amazed by the food, customer service and how coordinated they are. We ordered vegetable sandwich and broiled chicken sandwich with cheese fries. Both were juicy and yum. While we were waiting on our food order, we were greeted by a gentleman who works there Daniel. He helped us with our order. It was a busy Sunday lunch and was crowded so we were looking for some empty chairs to sit, the gentlemen again helped us find one, cleaned it up for us and was very polite and courteous. So, i asked his name to write about our experience and kind service there as he helped our dining experience be very pleasant. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. It's a must go, and you will be amazed by their kind service."}
{"text":"Unlike Giordano's, Portillos has made the move into the market without losing the taste and quality of their Chicagoland location. The Italian Beef was great, the fries were perfectly fried, and the chocolate cake was delicious as always. They handled the large number of people better than I've seen other's handled at any other location in the area. We'll be back regularly!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Portillo's is finally in CU! We stopped here on Friday around 2:00 and were hoping it wouldn't be too busy, no such luck. Parking lot was full and the line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building. There was quite the line when we got inside, but it moved surprisingly fast.  I got the chicken sandwich, my girlfriend got the italian beef, and we split some cheese fries. The food was so good. Not being from the Chicago area I'd only had Portillo's a handful of times, but the food was just as good as the times I had it when in the Chicagoland area.  I was definitely impressed by the staff and how quick they were able to take orders and get us our food. I'm looking forward to the day when it isn't quite so crazy, but until then I'll still make the occasional stop for my Portillo's fix."}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger were excellent and the crinkle fries were good and the strawberry shake was excellent and the staff was good to us and the service was awesome. We will be back to Portillo's again."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Portillo's for the first time, but was seriously disappointed. I thought I'd go with a Chicago style hot dog, since that's one of the things they're known for, plus I actually LIKE hot dogs. It was so gross. I ate half and then gave up. It was worse than a concession stand hot dog, and I was expecting a superior hot dog experience. Plus, WHY is the pickle relish ARTIFICIALLY COLORED??? It was as vivid as a green crayola marker. Weird."}
{"text":"This experience happened a few months ago. I ordered food on my lunch break through the car wash system and received the wrong food that did not include my drinks. I was rushed through the caution cones and wasn't able to check my order until after I had drove through. I got out of my car and tried flagging down an employee only to have them tell me to drive back through the long line. My total time of waiting in line to the point that I received the wrong food was pushing 24 mins. I had only 30 designated for my lunch break. I was out of options so I took the food and left. I called the store after this happened and was put on hold for over 20 mins (I have the screen shots of the stores phone number with duration of call). I simply wanted a refund because of the wrong items i received. After 20 mins, a male manager picked up the phone and handled the situation by saying corporate would mail me gift cards for the mistake. So I gave him my personal, private information and he told me I would be receiving the gift card within two business weeks. Two months later still nothing. I have lost your trust and you've lost my business. Now I will rate accordingly, and never return. If I could rate under a 1 star I would."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and fries here, but that drive-thru ordering process they have going is wonky.  Why can't you just order at the speaker, pay, pick up and leave like normal drive thrus?  They have an army of order takers who come to you window and 2 lanes that merge into one.  Drive thru service takes far too long."}
{"text":"What a difference a State makes. Though not fond of the Portillo's in AZ. This one rocks. We had the \"Big Beef\" an Italian beef sandwich with sweet and hot peppers and mozzarella cheese. It was moist and most delicious. Each bite was juicy beef heaven. The onion rings were decent with whole onions. The ice cold glass of beer washed down every bite to perfection. It would get five stars if we hadn't had Al's Beef of Chicago before. We recommend this enjoyable beef stop. Thanks for reading. Avram"}
{"text":"What is there not to love about Portillos?!  They instantly have the best hot dog, Italian beef and onion rings in Champaign!  I can't say anything bad about this place, even when they are super busy the service is good!"}
{"text":"Yay, Portillo's is finally in Champaign!  But just like Giordano's, it is close, but not quite exact to its Chicago counterpart.   This being the first week of opening, I knew  it was in my best interest to come in at an off-peak the time. My kids and I chose to come in at 4pm.  the  parking lot was full but not completely packed. The drive-through was busy so we opted to go inside.   The inside is decorated to celebrate postwar post WWI era. Lots of airplanes old, military signs, ads and tons of friendly, enthusiastic staff.   The line wasn't too bad, and we ordered an Italian Beef, a couple of hot dogs, a vanilla shake and some fries.   Considering how busy it was, the food came out with in about five minutes.  I dove right in and my Italian beef tasted as it should, but as I continued eating, i found it to be really salty and just very overwhelming.  LOts of heavy beef.  The fries were hot and crispy, but again super salty.   My son was working on his milkshake and that tasted great.   My 4yr old daughter loved the hot dog -  very easy for her to eat!  After i finished, I didn't feel so great....even three hours later, it still sat there in my stomach....i never felt like that after a portillo's meal..... maybe next time, I'll try one of their salads.....  A great addition to Champaign, but i would probably weigh 300lbs if I frequent this place.... it needs to be used with caution ....."}
{"text":"Portillos is an amazing fast food restaurant with a little bit of everything. I always get the cheese fries and usually the beef sandwich with a side of hot peppers. My wife loves the strawberry milk shack and the grilled chicken sandwich. You can't go wrong with anything that you order at Portillos. I would recommend Portillos to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Portillo's in Chicago, Portillo's in Champaign, Portillo's in Arizona, I've enjoyed you all... I want Italian beef and fries (can we get one in Kansas City??)"}
{"text":"My buddy and I were traveling to his grandparent's house and we noticed that they opened a Portillo's out here in Champaign. It was mad busy which is understandable because it's new out here.   We waited in line to order for about 10 minutes, then waited about 15 minutes to receive our food. Surprised it wasn't longer for the amount of people there.   I ordered the Big Beef sandwich dipped with hot peppers. It was extremely messy because I had them dip it, but it was so worth the mess. It was delicious, the meat was moist, and so flavorful. I also got the Chocolate Cake Shake. It was a shake like no other. It was thick, creamy, and had chunks of an actual piece of their cake in it.  The atmosphere was really cool. Neon signs are everywhere. They have windows and you can see them making your food. It's a little cramped but you gotta find a way to fit that amount of people somewhere.   Overall it's a solid 4 star restaurant. I recommend to anyone that hasn't been before."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants ever. I would have to say my last experience at the Champaign location was mediocre. Fries were excellent as always. Cheese for those fires tasked burnt and was disgusting. I do always get an Italian beef sandwich, at any location i visit and this time the sandwiches not good. I cannot put my finger in it, as to what was wrong with it but it definitely did not meet normal expectations. The one thing I can describe is the meat tasted gritty.  Oh yes. I will be back, I just didn't have a great experience this last visit."}
{"text":"The food is good because of the name, but the service is horrendous. I've used the drive-thru multiple times and have had to wait 30+ minutes. Yesterday, I waited for 45 minutes for a standard meal for 2. Once we finally got our order, the order was incorrect and they forgot to give me the bread that came with my salad. It will be a long time before I return to this Portillos and would not advise anyone to go here. Stick to the Chicagoland locations. Champaign is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go now! I'm so happy they brought one to Champaign! I always get their jumbo chili cheese dog which surprisingly is only $3.75! Their fries are crinkle cut which are always tasty. I've also had their famous chocolate cake shake which was addicting! I'm not that big of a fan of chocolate, but I loved this! It's not too over the top if you're not a chocolate lover but the flavor of the cake is rich enough for anyone with a sweet tooth! I hope to try their Italian beef soon because it says you can get it \"dry\" (less gravy), extra gravy, or dipped in the gravy! I've heard it's amazing, so I'm looking forward to trying it next!   I love the prices at this place. Everything is priced like (sometimes less) than other fast food restaurants. The lines are always long, but if you are willing to wait a little bit, they actually push you through fairly quickly for how many people there are! I am surprised at how fast they push me through no matter how super busy they are! There is also a Portillo's app you can get to order your food if you don't want to wait in the line.   The employees are always very friendly and fun! The atmosphere feels like you are at an old fair in Chicago! I give this place 5 stars! I've been here 3 times since it's opened a week ago and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"So glad they brought a Portillo's to Champaign!! Shakes are great! Love the hot dog and the Italian beef! If you can, get here a little early on weekends and grab one of the outside tables. :)"}
{"text":"Doubt that we will ever go back. Messed up order. Cold food when order was corrected. Others that were with us that had placed orders before us had to ask twice where their order was. Food wasn't that good that I would want to wait that long for it again."}
{"text":"Just a hot dog place with other stuff.  The Italian beef if good, but always better made at home.  The loaded Polish is worth getting but it really is \"just a hot dog place\"."}
{"text":"So I ordered online to pick up in the drive thru.  Easy ordering, LONG line at the drive thru, my mistake. Food was hot and good. Onion rings were ok, not worth the price in my opinion.  However the Italian Beef and Ribs were excellent. Jumbo chili cheese dog had perfect amount of toppings and would also rate excellent. Greek pasta salad was good, I think could use a bit more something... Oregano? Salt? Pepper? Something. Lastly the double cheese burger was fantastic!! Perfectly grilled, soft bun, delicious  Will I go again? DEFINITELY!!"}
{"text":"This Portillos, is the worst I believe outside of Chicago.  I have gone to this portillos, several times, and the last time, was THE LAST TIME!.  Slow does not quite describe the speed of service, Quality is below what I would expect for such a well branded company. Mangement, well, if their is a manager that has a grasp of his restaurant, then I woldnt be writing this poor review. We order the same thing every time,  2 beef with cheese 1 with Peppers 1 without. The cheese, isnt enough to cover a single triangle from a bag of Tortilla chips. French Fries, are a waste of time and space, soggy, and not fresh and crisp. You can tell by the \" I dont want to be here look\" on the employees, that this is not where you want to dine in or drive thru at.  Simply a poor excuse for such a great restaurant brand.  Chicago should be ashamed of this location, it is no wonder that theya re looking for managemetn continuously. After 35 yrs in the hospitality business and more than half of it, in restaurants, Portillos, Champaign, needs to get back to the basics of Guest Service."}
{"text":"First visit to the famed hot dog stand born in Chicago. Monday night after 9:30pm and it didn't appear super busy. I tried the Italian Beef sandwich which was more than plenty of food for me, but then I saw that they have tamales and I had to try one of those. Price was fair. Added an iced tea and a chocolate shake and totaled $13 and change.   We were dining in and watched many employees in the kitchen area. Seemed to be a lot going on, but not a lot really being accomplished. It certainly wasn't fast food.   I would have preferred to be sipping my iced tea and sitting at a table while one of those employees brought our order to the table. I'm thinking of Culver's method. Culver's food is usually much faster than this place.   That said: the Italian Beef was spot on fantastic and the tamale was absolutely amazing. Nothing like it here in C-U. I will be back, even though I don't like the waiting. They do have online ordering. Perhaps that will help get a faster food turnout."}
{"text":"This location is terribly run. The food is standard and amazing as usual, but the staff is terrible. They are way too slow for a typical Portillo's restaurant. They need more staff and to learn how a real Portillo's location operates. Someone from one of the Chicagoland locations needs to fix this location."}
{"text":"If this is going to survive as a Portillos they really need to get their operations in order. I have been to a lot of portillos. It's probably my favorite restaurant. This one has NO sense of urgency in their employees. I went inside to eat and through the drive thru to get something to take home. Both were the Longest waits I have ever experienced at any one of these locations. It should not take 30 min to go through your drive through. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Average, low effort American fare.  Maybe I just don't \"get\" Portillos, but I was not impressed. Their hot dogs and sausage sandwiches are average, I could do just as well with minimal effort at home. They always seem to have an unnecessary and unsustainable number of employees around. No less than 5 employees (not including those inside the building!) shepherded my car through the drive thru process."}
{"text":"This Portillo's does not measure up to their brand standard. Every time Ive visited the location (3 times now - 3 strikes they're out!) something sucks about my visit.    Twice the service was a disaster... be it rude cashiers or excessively long waits for food. This last time, the dining room was a filthy mess. I've seen cleaner floors and tables in sports stadiums. It was gross to walk in the dining room, and trash was overflowing.  I'm from Chicago. Ive seen the Portillo's Brand perform much better. Either hire better staff, or better people to manage the staff.   Portillo's Champaign needs to be better all around: Clean your restaurant. Be polite and professional as I hand you my money to purchase your product. Shake a tail feather and have my food ready promptly."}
{"text":"When they first opened the drive thru and service was great. Now, it's rare I make it through the drive thru in under 20 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous. Also today when I went there they messed up my order and the lady tried to refuse to fix it until I told that that's not what I ordered. She was incredibly rude and you could tell she was just lazy and didn't want to fix it. Another drive thru worker flat out asked me why I was still waiting there in a really rude matter when the other lady was \"fixing\" my order. How do these people have jobs? Avoid the drive thru at all costs! These people have NO idea what they are doing and will give you attitude when it's their fault they messed up."}
{"text":"I had 0 experience with Portillo's before they came to Champaign. But I found out I truly enjoy Chicago-style hot dogs, and the prices are very reasonable.   I have yet to try the chocolate cake shake but have heard it's THE thing to try there. The chocolate cake on its own is pretty good. Edit: I have tried the chocolate cake shake and did not enjoy it -- WAY too sickeningly sweet.  The fries are just okay for me--they're helped if you get the cheese to dip them into.   Once or twice, I've attempted to get into the drive-thru and it's either wrapped around the building with a line out the parking lot nearby, or I've shown up when an 18-wheeler was blocking the entire drive-thru, presumably stocking the establishment.   It's an *incredibly* noisy establishment, mostly from the staff blaring into a microphone for the hundreds of orders going out. If you can tolerate that, then you're probably fine. But I've gone with a family member who is incredibly sensitive to noise and it was not a pleasant experience.   All in all, good food (when you brace yourself for the experience)."}
{"text":"Being from Seattle I had never experienced the Chicago style Italian Beef... omg. People on the west coast are missing out! Hubby and I each ordered the regular size Italian Beef and onion rings. You can order them how you like... sweet peppers? Hot peppers? How much gravy? You decide!  I'm not sure about other locations but this one is always packed! So I recommend ordering from their app ($5 off your first order!). You can set the time you want to come in, pay, and it'll be ready for you when you get there! No waiting in line! Also, the regular sandwich was big, packed with meat, I couldn't finish it so stick to that unless you have a huge appetite! I can't wait to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"All the hype and no service - waited for sandwiches and drinks for ohh say about 20-25 minutes, food was not warm and hot dog bun was soggy due to most likely the insane wait time. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Well I agree with Timothy O. on this one. It's ok....the hot dog was good but it's no better than a Steak & Shake hot dog in my opinion. But a lot more money. They were busy yesterday afternoon. Drive thru, was jammed it's loud and for a self service restaurant it's not a value to me. But I'm giving it a 3 star for the popularity. The shake was good, but I must be missing something."}
{"text":"It's after you leave Chicago and crave a Beef dipped that you really start to appreciate Portillo's ; the extensive menu that is offered as a dine-in customer is terrific and drive thru efficient.  They also serve excellent salads, pastas and desserts.  Take the time, park the car and dine in for an entirely different experience. Drive-thru is only tip of iceberg."}
{"text":"Been there several times food is good.   But this time went to drive thru service was bad.   Give it time and will try again.   Waited 20 minutes in drive thru. Employees were more worried about personal business."}
{"text":"Don't bother going at lunch time. They take deliveries blocking the parking lot. What a mess they have created.  Looked forward to going there for lunch. You need a traffic director."}
{"text":"I have to update my rating because the customer service I just received was pathetic. Waited 20 mins for a tuna Caesar salad. They kept saying chicken, then correcting themselves by saying tuna. I corrected them twice. Went home and realized it was the wrong salad (some other random chicken salad). Came back and explained what happened and waited another 25 mins after being told to go to the first window. The first person at the window assumed I was another person and was snappy and when I explained what I was here for. The person at the second window came out after 25 mins thinking I was another person and informed me that no one told her that I was the \"tuna salad guy.\" Not once did I receive a normal apology and certainly didn't get anything complimentary. Come on Portillos, that's crap. Do better."}
{"text":"Definitely need more help or training.  Service is extremely slow lines are very long. I understand they're new but this is ridiculous. By the way I'm still waiting on my food and can't give you a rating."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Portillo's location. I have to give this company credit, their new locations are always so consistent.   If you've never been to Portillo's, just imagine a better version of Niro's Gyros (except they don't have Gyros haha).   Chicago-style fast food done perfectly.   Wonderful juicy flavorful Italian beef. Get it dipped with hot peppers and provolone.   Chicago style hotdogs.   Juicy char burgers.   Perfect cheese sauce in which to dip the lovely golden crispy crinkle fries.   They have vegetable sandwiches and fish sandwiches for a lighter option. The salads are excellent, but probably not the healthiest salad in town. The chopped salad is very filling.   Chocolate cake shakes! Try one and feel bad about yourself in the best possible way.   The chocolate cake is great in non-milkshake form too. I hear the secret is mayonnaise.   The beer and wine is so cheap too."}
{"text":"take out ...got the beef n cheddar croissant, ugh dry, plastic-y cheese (minimal) and beef was dry with no flavor was told, after the fact, I was suppose to get au jus on the side next time....nah, I think not"}
{"text":"Whenever,  wherever I my roam if there's a Portillo's near I will find it and make time to go.  This location, in my experience, was identical to any Chicagoland location.  They were packed - which is typical for these guys during the lunch hours and were handling it with grace.  To some this it too slow, too chaotic, but to anyone who knows these joints, knows it's part of the price you pay for the delicious b, b, b, b, BEEF, The Gravy, the chill and Chicago dogs, the Italian combos, the chop salad THE CHOCOLATE CAKE.  If you have never been here, man you gotta go and if you know Portillo's, it's exactly what you know and love!"}
{"text":"The décor looks good.   Food was good probably a 3 1/2 on a busy Friday night.   Not complaining, it is what Portillo's is.  If you love Chicagoland Portillo's, you'll like this place, it's close to the same.   Service was fine/it's different for Champaign than other places but it's good if you can get use to it.   Restaurant is loud/very loud which is again one of those things you either are good or bad with.   Will be back/not every week but will return again."}
{"text":"I am in awe of how well every single Portillo's I've been to is run.  Have you ever been to a Portillo's that's not busy?  I haven't.  I realized that when this one opened here.  It's a well-oiled machine that other fast food restaurants could learn something from.  I honestly don't know how they do it.  Anyway, this one is exactly like you'd expect.  Just as solid as every other Portillo's restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to every Portillos there is. This one , so far , is the best (That is saying something). Great job you guys. Thanks to you building one in Champaign , I will now gain 50 lbs in about a month !!!! If u have never been to a Portillos b4, don't let the lines scare you, they know what they are doing and you will get through faster than if you have 3 people in front of you at McDonald's,  I promise !!! #PortillosRocks"}
{"text":"Tried this place last week and enjoyed it for the most part. The staff was doing an exceptional job managing the drive-thru, especially considering how packed it was.   My personal food experience wasn't outstanding. I went with the beef sandwich, extra gravy. I thought it was good but not great. The meat was sliced a bit thick for my liking, and the gravy was mostly flavorless. My fiancé had a vanilla malt and a hot dog. She said both were great and has been talking about the malt ever since.   So my recommendation will have to be if you're wanting a hot dog and/or shake/malt, go for it. If you're in the mood for the beef sandwich, maybe look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We arrived on Sunday, 2/11/18, slightly after noon. As we pulled up to the drive thru there was one car in front of us waiting at the window. We proceeded to place our order and then waited 12-15 minutes before getting it. While waiting, and after paying, we were then asked to pay again, which was corrected after we informed them that we had already paid. (This should have been a heads up) Once we received our order there was no apology offered for the long wait. And of course to top it off, when we got home the order was incorrect. Having lived in Chicago for nearly 15 years we had become accustomed to Portillo's excellent, speedy service. At the Champaign location we have consistently waited in line extended periods of time, but this was by far our worse experience when all of the above components are accumulated. Come on Champaign!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Very pleased with the speed of the service each time I have been there. The food is always great with a friendly staff! I went there on opening day and was very impressed with how quick they were for the volume of customers who came that day! Would recommend this location to a friend."}
{"text":"Their food is not outstanding to all the others with Italian beefs and Chicago hot dogs. The workers were not focused on my order and got it wrong. This was the first time I went to Portillo's and plan on not coming back."}
{"text":"General Manager Tom made our day! It is a very busy restaurant however they are doing great job!"}
{"text":"Such a fresh new place! I usually wait a few weeks after a place has opened before going to try it out just to avoid the rush but I've been twice in the first week of opening and it's been a great experience both times! It's been packed but they have their routines so well down that we didn't wait more than ten minutes for our food. Every worker is super friendly and it makes the experience even better. The chocolate cake shake is a must get! It's so rich and delicious! Definitely somewhere you have to try while on champaign!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't good. I ordered the chicken sandwich on a crossiont, and they gave me the chicken sandwich on a bun. I ordered it with no lettuce, and surprise! There was lettuce on my sandwich. The chicken was tough and overcooked. Went through the drive through and the whole process took about 45 minutes. Onion rings were rock solid and inedible. The entire experience was just horrible. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have been impressed with the employees each time.  They are definitely hustling to get customers their food quickly.  Food was delicious and I love the ease of pre order, payment, and order pick up.  Great job to everyone working over July 4th week.  You were able to maintain great service even with the crowds! We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Normally this would be a 5 Star review as I am a long time (25+years) Portillo fan, having lived in the Chicago area until a few yrs ago. WHILE HAPPY THAT PORTILLOS IS IN CU.  I am so disappointed in the wait time and sloppy staff.  This is approx the 10th visit since opening and service is not really better. Long wait times missing items incorrect orders. While the food is the same great quality the staff just does not compare with the fast paced and accurate servers in the Plainfield/Naperville// Joliet area. This store won't lose my business but it's just not up to big city standards"}
{"text":"I enjoy the big hot dogs with everything on them and cheese fries.  Portillo's is very busy and noisy inside.  You place your order at the cash register and pay for it, then you walk to the other end, and can either sit down close to where they're yelling out your number or stand around waiting on your number to be called. They usually sack up your food when its done, then you go look for somewhere to sit down."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review with a bit of heresy: I don't think Portillo's is the best thing since sliced bread. I know there is a large and vocal fan base out there, and no doubt, Portillo's serves up some very good renditions of Chicago favorites, but having grown up in the Windy City I know there are other less famous outlets that make better hot dogs.   That said, I definitely like Portillo's and the new Champaign location is off to a roaring start. Portillo's offers a very classic version of the garden dog (if you've read my other reviews you'll know my thoughts on the Zen of Chicago hot dogs) with all of the right ingredients, including sport peppers, fluorescent-green relish, steamed bun. Their Italian beef is also well-done, not overly wet and with sweet and hot (giardinera) peppers.   They do get things right, and provide very good service. I was impressed with the way they manage the drive-through and keep people moving through quickly. I wish the location had a bit more room as it's always pretty crowded but maybe that's just a temporary condition from pent-up demand. In the end, Portillo's is usually the best option in the area and particularly so for locations outside of Chicago. I still come here to satisfy my Chicago dog fix. Recommended."}
{"text":"Food is typically decent as long as the order is correct.  Today the guy at the speaker thought it was a race to see how fast and discourteous he could speak to customers.  We heard 3 before we were up for our turn.  Portillos is expensive for what you get but it's good for what it is. The young lady at the window obviously hated her job as well.  Someone from Chicago needs to visit this location because when they first opened they were awesome now I tend to avoid this location and wait for trips north I will add that the final person we dealt with saved ya a star because he was such a friendly and outgoing dude.  Didn't catch his name or I'd have called and told ya he was awesome!"}
{"text":"If ur looking for Chicago style hot dogs with budget, Portillos is always a good option!"}
{"text":"Paid for chicken tenders and never received them in drive through.  Pretty sure there were other orders missing items because they came around the right hand side straight to the front of the line while the rest of us were waiting on the left. Schaumburg location definitely better, will just save my cravings for my next trip up north."}
{"text":"TASTELESS!!!  My husband and I actually ate their twice this evening -- the 1st time and the LAST time.  Had heard so many good comments about this restaurant we were excited for good flavor!  Ordered the \"famous\" Italian Beef and onion rings.  The onion rings were good, but the Italian beef had NO SEASONING at all -- meat was tender, but tasteless!  And the \"gravy\", aka au jus?  You get about 2 tablespoons and it, also is tasteless.  PLEASE use some seasonings!  I won't go back, nor will my husband and our family.  We threw more in the trash than we ate."}
{"text":"Went on a Wed afternoon. Not super busy but took 10-15 min+ to get food (Italian beef, burger, lrg fry, lrg drink). Sat down with my sandwich to find it was made without the peppers I asked (& was charged) for. So I make my way back to the counter to wait another 5+ min for the correct sandwich. By the time I return to my table, my daughter had already finished her lunch. After eating, I braved the counter again for a pc of chocolate cake. As I was eating it, I found what I assume was an egg shell (?) in it. So, I won't be returning for the hot food or cake any time soon. Food was ok, Coke was delicious, service was super slow."}
{"text":"Went there opening day and we were not disappointed.  We went through the drive up and it was running like a well oiled machine.  Our food was hot and the cheese fries were yummy like always.  They did get one of our sandwiches wrong but corrected it nicely and threw in a yummy piece of chocolate cake!  The place was extremely busy and the service was impeccable.  I hope this keeps up as we plan on returning.  Great opening day job!"}
{"text":"It was okay. I am use to Portillo up north (chicagoland area). My hotdog was poorly made and my fries wasnt hot. Waa very disappointed I made the hour and a half drive for it. But....the chocolate cake was good."}
{"text":"Ok so 20 days ago... had a GREAT experience! Tonight- horrible. Our ordered ahead food wasn't ready. My sandwich that was dry was supposed to have gravy on the side.. no gravy. It was supposed to also have an order of chicken fingers. Nope. So, I'm pissed. Just had surgery & this was all I wanted and I'm pissed that I'm sitting here with my order like this. Thanks a lot. Smh."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best additions to a restaurant in the city in a long time reasonably priced  food , I can't say enough about how pleased I was with my experience, cafeteria style environment no waiters but plenty of friendly staff on hand to help , I wished there was more handicapped parking it was full when I arrived and the only available spaces were in the far back of the restaurant, my only warning would be is to be careful about what time of day that you visit because you could experience a long wait time especially since they are new and the word is out that they are great . we arrived at  aproxametly 5:15 and had only A few minutes of wait but within 20 minutes of our arrival after we were seated the place filled up and there had to be a 20 minute wait time there were people standing everywhere waiting on their meals , there is a row of stools right by the pickup area that could be used to help with the waiting but no one was taking advantage of it so be careful but enjoy, , I know I will be back!!! And I'm hard to please."}
{"text":"It's good food and a good value just like most restaurant chains. Certainly not the best italian beef i've ever had but no matter what portillos i go to i know what i'm getting.   Just like the other restaurant chains"}
{"text":"Slowest service of any of the portillos. This friggin place would be out of business if in chicago. Food is not as good as chicago's portiliios either. Buy frozen home run beef. It will thaw in the time you wait for these clowns!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Portillo's Italian beef. I haven't found any Chicago type Italian beefs in any restaurant in this area. The pepperoncinis always give the fake ones away. I'd never eaten at a Portillo's, but have had many Italian beefs in Chicago at Al's and Mr. Beef. I hit the middle of the lunch hour on a weekday, and of course the place was packed. I was impressed at how efficient the serving process is and how the lines moved quickly. I ordered a beef/hot/dipped, my usual Chicago order. I sat down and opened the bag, and was encouraged by the weight of the sandwich. After I unwrapped it, I became less encouraged. The outside of the wrapper was very greasy. I picked up the sandwich and took a bite. It was extremely greasy, and my hands were covered in grease. I was expecting that they'd dip it in the au jus, but it was almost like it was dipped in a french fryer. The beef was very lightly seasoned, and I had to strain to detect any garlic or oregano. It also needed salt. I finished half of it, using about 12 of their tissue napkins, and decided there was just too much grease to finish. On a brighter note, my companion had the Greek salad and pronounced it very good. I'll go to Portillo's again, but no more Italian beef."}
{"text":"I didn't see what all of the hype is about... Italian beef...after a few bites egh...bland. You have to stand in line to stand in line to wait and get yelled at to listen to be yelled at and listen to everyone yelling. Not worth the wait to eat in a loud dining room I don't get it there are places soo much better here in champaign did we really need another franchise pushing out another mom and pops place... Prolly wont go back...."}
{"text":"I used to live in Chicago and loved Portillo's. We're visiting family in Champaign and we're delighted that a storefront has opened here, too.  I knew it would be crowded for lunch so we visited at about 11:15am and guess what? The place was packed.  The loud, crowded experience may initially frustrate newbies but once you're indoctrinated you'll be a forever fan.  Welcome Portillos!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have the opportunity to be there for the soft opening!! It was soo yummy. My last time having Portillos was when I was 7 years old back home in Chicago. We had the Hamburger and Chicken sandwich. Both were so yummmy!!!! What stood out to me the most for some reason was the onion rings. They were soooo amazing. Great portion of food too!!!! I left almost too full. The staff was all very courteous and smiling even though it was packed. Love love love."}
{"text":"We went during the Golden Ticket giveaway to try the meals here. I've been to Portillo's before and had their italian beef so that was what I was aiming to have this time around. I got the italian beef with sausage and cheese fries. We got chocolate cake as well.  The italian beef with the gravy has a great amount of seasoning and worked really well with the italian beef! My bun wasn't too soggy. It was great :). I loved the sausage in it too (It had a nice kick to it) but it was a lot for me lol. I ended up removing the sausage midway through the sandwich and found there was a substantial amount of beef left! So yummy! The cheese fries were delicious. Perfectly crisp fries and yummy cheese sauce.  The chocolate cake, I heard, has mayo in it...this cake was so moist! I liked the frosting. Overall, the staff did a great job because it was SUPER busy and they were very friendly. Seems like it'll be a hit. I tried the random tamale that they also serve as well and this was yummy. Would make a great snack."}
{"text":"I DONT SEE THE HYPE. We had the chicago dog, italian beef, and the italian beef/sausage combo. The chicago dog was lacking and not work the money I paid for it. Ive had a better Chicago dog from sonic. The italian beef was ok but the price leaves me lacking and no reason to honestly go back. There is nothing special about the fries."}
{"text":"We had the Italian with sweet and hot peppers on the side. The sandwich just isn't a sandwich  without them and will order them on the sandwich next time.   Phone ahead with your order if you can. We came at 2:10 and it was a pretty long wait to order and receive but by the time we left the lines were nil."}
{"text":"I was here during the golden ticket event with some friends. At first, we were a little frightened by the crowds. To our surprise, the line moved extremely quickly and our food came out to us in a timely manner. I was extremely impressed with their fast and helpful service. We even had someone stop by our table and ask to throw away our trays. I didn't expect this kind of service from a Portillos. Now on to the food.... I got the Italian beef with cheese fries. I am a tiny person, I usually don't eat much, but man did I devour my sandwich. I highly recommend both those menu items. Overall, my whole group was happy our experience. Great job! Can't wait to stop by again."}
{"text":"I know this place is wildly popular and people were really excited they were coming to Champaign. Not sure why though. I had a loaded hot dog. It was tasteless and the bun was soggy. The fries were definitely nothing special. My daughter had the Italian beef. She said it was good. The place was packed at 11:30. There is not enough parking and the lot is poorly laid out. Doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really like Portillo's food. But the Champaign location is managed very poorly. Several employees were standing around and the so called fast food took an extremely long time to get. Can't anyone work fast anymore. I have been there 3 times during slow and busy times and it's like getting the food to the customers in an efficient manner has been lost....just saying"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the wait is not usually too bad.  They're very efficient, and everything is made to order.  They also have one of the fastest drive thrus in the west.  If you're dining in...depending on when you go..be prepared to fist fight people for a table.  If there was anything that kills the experience, it is the lack of seating, and nobody to really direct anybody where to sit.  The owner likes the model because he can churn out the food quickly, and not really have to take responsibility for seating or guest satisfaction."}
{"text":"I didn't want to get my hopes up. I loved Portillo's in Chicago, but I know it's a large store with many busy hands to handle. I've been going to this location since they opened. Unlike my friends who sometimes get dry Italian beef, I've never encountered a problem with their food. My issue is with the service. Every time I've ordered ahead of time or online, I've had to wait an additional 15-45 minutes after the ETA time provided on my receipt. It was frustrating to see all the customers that came in after us get their food and leave. The manager gave a slice of chocolate cake as an apology, but that's not going to bring back those minutes of my life."}
