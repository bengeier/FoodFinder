{"text":"The first time I went into coconut hut my boyfriend and I stood there for about four minutes...a young kid was working there and I understand if you're busy, I don't expect red carpet service but maybe just a hi or some acknowledgement would be nice. There was only one other customer in there who already had their smoothie. Not having much time to spare we left without being talked to or ordering. A week later I went in there again and this time I ordered. There was no soap in the bathrooms and all they had was a bottle of spray hand sanitizer that everyone has to touch if you use the restroom, the 14 year old who made my smoothie had no gloves on and dropped the lid to a vegetable container on the ground and put it right back..i am all for paying for good quality organic food but in my opinion the price for my smoothie was way too high for the size of something slightly larger than a shot glass. I would rather go to whole foods which bums me out because I wanted to really like this place and support smaller businesses."}
{"text":"Eh bland food , nothing special for a piece of lettuce with some raw vegetable in it. Definetly overpriced and super bland"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had the Tropical Tacos and Yuppy Greenburger. Many of these places lack flavor but these folks have it dialed in. I also tried the Coconut Mango Cream smoothie which was also fantastic. The staff is very nice and helpful. The food is great. Whether you're Vegan or just giving meat a break, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Thank you for the healthy and yummy menu!!  The acai and pitayah (dragonfruit) bowls were all excellent.  The restaurant was clean and well ventilated."}
{"text":"The smoothies are very good and I've never been disappointed. The staff is pretty laid back and chatty.  My only gripe is they are extremely overpriced. I understand it's all natural and what have you, but wow.  This place is certainly worth going back, but only on a pay day."}
{"text":"First time stopping in and the smoothies are delicious! We had a young man help us out and couldn't have had better service. He made great recommendations and had a great attitude!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the first time. Just got back in town from Cali and was craving an acai bowl. Food was fresh, delicious, and good customer service. Will return again!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious especially if you are vegan/gluten free. Very friendly !!! I had the tropical Pitaya and it was delicious . The menu was very extensive so I just asked what the most popular thing was and ordered it. I was not disappointed! I will return !!!! I can't wait to try something else on the menu too. I went on a Saturday morning and my service was very fast ."}
{"text":"How did I not know of this place? I went there Friday morning for the first time and had one of their breakfast bowls. It was really delicious and more than filled me up. Be forewarned. The Large size is LARGE, and could easily be shared. The owner was very helpful and the atmosphere is casual, not intimidating, so no need to worry if you can't tell your acai from your ch ch chia!"}
{"text":"Yummy stuff! Glad Mesa has an amazing fresh and plant based place filled with lots of creativity, healthy and delicious items!"}
{"text":"This place is the seed of an excellent idea. They just hit their one year anniversary and have had massive success for a one year start up. They already have awards from credible sources and the Yelp reviews are all seemingly accurate. They have many healthy choices, mostly cold, for hot days.  The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because I went in early for breakfast and they didn't have many options at all for breakfast. However, they informed me that they probably will be getting more options soon. I'm definitely going back and will give that 5 star once they upgrade their breakfast. Overall a very healthy and sustainable-minded business. Love the idea!"}
{"text":"The coconut hut is a very pleasant raw vegan restaurant from its food to its environment. The service was personable and the food cam out pretty quickly. The server even took the time to show me how to eat the Tacos. Would highly reccomend this place to anyone looking for healthy, good food and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have so many options, and every single option is nutritious and so delicious. They are more than just smoothies and juice, too. They have entree style dishes and coffee. The staff is nice and friendly as well! People of Chandler, please support businesses like this one! They're good for all of us- people, animals, planet!"}
{"text":"The traditional acai bowl was great, a little pricy but good. I was not a fan of my kids peaunut butter acai bowl. Like the atmosphere. I've had acai bowls at tournaments and they were cheaper and I got a lot more but this place is good for a craving."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! The girl beyond the counter helped me pick out the most delicious pitaya bowl & I splurged and had it served in a coconut. So fun & so insta worthy. There were a steady stream of people coming & going- families, professionals, all sorts. All the employees were what I would call \"cozy\"- super friendly & laid back with satisfaction as their goal. I would totally come back for some of their lunch offerings that looked delish!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!  I just tried it for the first time today...but I'm definitely hooked. I had the Coconut Mango Cream smoothie and the Protein Power Balls. They also have some savory dishes that I will be trying out this week. The customer service is amazing! As soon as I came in, the employees were very welcoming-- they asked if it was my first time there, and happily explained the menu and lunch specials."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Huge menu and all vegan. Came around 11:30am on a Sunday with out of town vegan relatives. More people came in after us but it never felt crowded and service was never slow. We ordered two smoothies, a sandwich, and pancakes. Everything tasted great! The employee was nice and very helpful in making suggestions for us. Food was served quickly. I will say prices were a little steep and the place is small so you can't really avoid the very loud kitchen (lots of blending and banging) but I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite vegan place ! We are absolutely obsessed with the coconut pitaya bowl as well as many other things on their menu. I am in heaven with each bite of the coconut pitaya bowl !  Everyone is super friendly and the atmosphere is laid back and cozy. Always be diggin the good vibezZ and music. My two year son and I try to come here at least once a week and not only does he enjoy all of the food but he's always very happy and comfortable here because they are kind enough to have a basket of communal toys for kids to play with which is awesome ! We are all about coconut hut and we really appreciate that they use organic fruits and veggies that means a lot to us. Thank you so much coconut hut for existing !"}
{"text":"I have followed this page on Instagram for a long time after hearing about it but never tried it. I live about 25 min away but wanted to give a good smoothie place a try. My first impression was extremely disappointed. Employees were goofing off and did not even acknowledge that I came in. After I asked them if they were ready for my order they were polite and took my order. Smoothie was good but not worth $7 or the drive. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! They're creative with the food, the people are super awesome to talk to, everything in there is great. The energy is great. It's my new addiction. The pumpkin spice latte is so delicious and you can taste how clean it is. My new addiction!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is legit! Super hidden though. If you're vegan, you definitely want to check it out. I had the Acai Traditional Bowl. Super fresh and well balanced. The interior of the place is super chill. Surfer video playing, acoustic guitar ready to play, local art on the walls--the kind of place you can go to meet a friend or to study. The owner was really friendly and took the time to explain the menu after we told him we'd never been there before. Go support this spot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly over priced, and I found a long black curly hair in my food that was definitely not mine. I had the portabella mushroom lunch special and it was tasteless and again, way over priced for what you really get. I don't think I will be back here and I don't recommend it. Their acai bowls are good, but I'm sure there are other places that offer just the same (maybe for cheaper?)"}
{"text":"It was amazing. I'm stuffed and I'm never stuffed these days. My daughter is stuffed with good food too. And to be stuffed with healthy food is a good feeling! The owners family was there and I love local family owned businesses. Don't think almond milk should be extra but it's hard for local businesses to thrive so I guess it's all good. Will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious smoothies! But the best item on the menu it the açaí bowls in a coconut. Perfect!"}
{"text":"i will be going back. Friendly who recommended other places i should visit in the area for cool experiences. I ordered a PB Acai bowl and it was good. Looking forward to trying other things they have to offer."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time after seeing pictures online. It looked cool so I wanted to check it out. I ordered two acai bows in a coconut. It came to $43!!! I think that is outrageous. Other places around here are under $20 for two. We had a very long wait. It took them over 45 minutes to make them. When we finally got them there is now way it was the 16 oz size we ordered. They gave one of us a deep coconut and the other was very shallow. No way 16 oz would fit into that. I will definitely not go back. Berry divine is so much better. They also were not friendly at all. All around horrible service."}
{"text":"We were excited to find a vegan restaurant close to were we live. Unfortunately, the food was overpriced and it had no taste. I ordered extra avocado in my chickpeas burrito to find that the \"extra\" was slim to none. When I asked if the burrito had the avocado because it taste it like it had none they brought me a tablespoon size portion. The \"scrambled chickpeas\" in the burrito were dry and had a sandy texture. My husband ordered the pancakes they were okay in taste but nothing to die for. The texture was off. It was was not a pleasant experience. Vegan cuisine does not have to be bland, boring and overpriced. I would not recommend this place. This was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Somewhat hidden behind Cuisine and Wine Bistro, good Acai and Pitaya bowls as well as good organic coffee.  No fancy coffee drinks , but plenty of healthy juice drinks and smoothies."}
{"text":"Great place! Smoothies are excellent. They have a great veggie menu to choose from.  Friendly stuff! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing! Such a lovely place that I found on my trip in Arizona. A great selection of amazing vegan smoothie bowls and other delicious foods- you need to try the avocado toast. They also had Pitaya bowls which I had never tried before! (Pitaya is dragonfruit). And it was all for an affordable price. They also have delicious iced coffee with a great selection of dairy-free creamers. You need to check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I had the PB&Acai bowl on recommendation of the barista(? what do you call a smoothie maker!?). It was so great.   There's an option to upgrade your bowl so that it comes served in a coconut, but I just couldn't get myself to spend an extra $4. Someday I will have to try it, it's too cute not to.   Cool place, makes me feel like a hippie, will be back to try some food and a coconut bowl"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need to be healthy..thank goodness for places like the Coconut Hut.. They have amazing acai bowls and they also have pitaya items. I grabbed a coconut pitaya to go. Pineapple, coco butter, granola, banana, strawberry and honey. Sooo good! The staff is really friendly too."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Great staff and all their smoothies and bowls are delicious. Love coming here and feeling healthy and supporting a local business!"}
{"text":"Cute little bohemian style smoothie place! Good vibes and friendly staff, plus the quality is really good! No chunks in the smoothies and they have the option of putting your smoothie in an actual coconut which is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Awesome place ! Even if you aren't vegan you should come try. The bowls are amazing and they have a great choice of other items that are delicious. Cool vibe and delicious food."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! Great place for people that are gluten and dairy intolerant! I ended up getting the coconut acai without the bananas. The fresh fruit and granola on top with the honey made it super fresh.    I'm really excited to come back and try the pancakes!   Biggest downside was how small it was on the inside. I also waited well over 10 minutes for my bowl and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Quite costly for not many options. Only one type of protein for smoothies. For a small smoothie it cost me over $7.00.   Also no peanut options. Wanted to skip the fat and have peanut powder- much better for your body, but they only have peanut butter. My smoothie wasnt quite smooth, had hard bits of pea protein which was not too appetizing.  The shop itself was cute, with games and seats."}
{"text":"Love that this place offers such healthy options. I've been looking for places that promote healthy, organic varieties. Came here first day last week to try their zucchini pasta and I'm glad I did. Make note that this dish is raw and all vegas but it's sooo delish. They even have Himalayan salt available to add on top. The smoothies are good. I came back today to try their breakfast menu. I am totally hooked on their buckwheat pancakes!! So good with coconut butter on top.. their healthy scramble was to die for also. The staff here are wonderful. It is on the pricey side but you really get great quality food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I love acai bowls & was excited to try this place. They had several varieties & my husband & I got the chocolate bowls. My brother got the peanut butter bowl. They were a little pricey to start with & it was extra to add protein.  For 3 bowls (1 large & 2 small) it was $41! That seems ridiculous.  The bowls were definitely good, but not as good as other acai bowl places that are a few bucks cheaper per bowl. I won't be back unless the prices change."}
{"text":"So excited to find this little gem! It can be pretty difficult as a vegan to find something to eat at a cafe but their menu is excellent :) the owners seem very friendly and accommodating and the food is excellent and nutritious. It's so cute inside and they play nice music as well."}
{"text":"This place looks good ,but the employees are filthy and have terrible hygiene. They scratched their hair / head and then went on to cut fruit. Had gloves on went out side came back in and still work the same plastic gloves to continue prep I wish I would have seen this before I ordered my food . Wiping hand in pants with gloves, playing with piercings and not washing hands just some of the few things I saw all in one sitting all while the owner was there .... will not eat here again and I advise you to not go there as well until they do some major hygiene changes I literally threw away my açaí bowl as soon as I left or board of health come in"}
{"text":"Good green smoothies. Good green juice. Kid sizes to small for anyone other than the youngest of children."}
{"text":"This place is kinda hidden but it's a great option for some healthy smoothies.  They have a ton of options: Coconut milk, almond milk, rice powder, chia seeds - everything people keep telling us to eat but we don't. I had a raspberry strawberry chia seed concoction with coconut milk and agave. It was pretty good.  I did think $6+ for a smoothie was kinda expensive but when you think about all of the ingredients they use it makes sense for the price.   So if you want a smoothie place to try out this place is better than all the sugary nonsense from Jamba Juice and has more options than whole foods."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Love the vibe and the food! Lots to pick from, good prices. I will be back to try it again soon! Thanks for the food! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy! It's really hard to find places that cater to Paleo especially to go! The hot green tea with coconut milk was amazing and the pitaya bowl was fabulous! I can't wait to try more of their creations!"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy smoothies and juices! I had organic white tea! Refreshing and ice cold! Sheridan is a cool owner! Recommend yes! Cool atmosphere yes! Liked the surf videos too!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they first opened up! Everything is organic and they put a lot of time and effort into what they create and it really shows! The owners are super friendly and it's always nice to get a nice taste of a California vibe while in Az. My favorite Acai place hands down. The portions are very generous compared to other places. People seem to complain about the price but you get what you pay for. It's sad that people are so use to eating fast,  cheap and processed crap that they complain about real raw and organic food being pricier or taking more time than that chemical crap food. Health is true wealth and that's exactly what you'll get if you come here, a healthy body and state of mind and of course delicious food and drinks :) highly recommend"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I appreciate these types of places. I know when I come in I am putting the best possible food in my body, and I know that costs extra than some fast food crap. But GEEZ!!!!!   COME ON!!!!! 2 items that say $6 on the board, my total was $17.25? HELLLLLLLL NOOOOOOO!!!!! Just like a few have said, it's $2 extra to switch liquid. WELL THEN......you need to tell me that it's $2 extra..........perfect place for people with disposable income that can throw money around, not for a hard working dad taking his kid out for an afternoon snack.  Price is too much for me. I can't afford to come back, with hidden costs like that."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this morning with a friend. I got the Tropical Acai bowl with almond milk and protein powder. My friend got the Peanut butter acai bowl with almond milk. After the first taste, we are definitely hooked! So delicious! So fresh! Friendly, kind, and attentive staff. The chef came and introduced himself as well and made sure we were satisfied. The vibe definitely reminded me of being in Hawaii. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Super Fresh,Good Service. Wished they open longer to grab some dinner on my way home"}
{"text":"Super good food! The chickpea breakfast burrito is awesome! The prices are a bit steep but I'd rather eat something fresh and organic than something cheap and fast."}
{"text":"I've been to Coconut Hut numerous times and every time I try something different. The acai bowls, pitata bowls and smoothies are all fantastic. The organic, tropical feel is just what I need! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. I ordered the Green burger and was very disappointed. The 2 light colored pieces that held the small brown patty were not firm at all. I had to  cut it up with knife and fork.  Very bland and no taste at all. The server had told me it was messy and brought me extra nspkins. I had to call the young cook/server back over to ask him which was the bun and which was the patty. It came with a couple of apple slices, dried up carrot and celery sticks. I told him I did not care for the sandwich, so he  showed me which trash can to put it in. It would have been nice of them to offer to fix me something else.  It was a $10.00 mess and I left hungry! In the past I have ordered the  Buckwheat  pancakes and Cheeze Quesadilla which were both good."}
{"text":"Went here around 30 min before closing and wasn't greeted by the staff who took our order. We asked if they had the nutrition info on the menu items and she looked baffled like why would they ask that. We ended up just ordering an açaí bowl and the breakfast burrito. The açaí bowl didn't take long but the burrito literally took 20 minutes. By the time it was ready I didn't want it anymore. Not only was the service slow, it was inappropriate for the staff to start putting chairs up on tables to get ready for closing. We felt rushed and like they wanted us to get out. Even though they were closing soon that doesn't mean just start packing up. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the business idea, and love that they cater to specific dietary needs. Downfall is the amount of time it takes for your order to be made. As a walk in, and with no other orders in front of me, I have on multiple occasions waited between 15 and 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service is incredibly slow. I waited over 15 minutes for a burrito, with four people working and no one else in the shop. I was late to work, but that was my fault for coming here. They don't seem to be equipped to cook food, just smoothies."}
{"text":"While the food and the selection of bowls is great, they are pricey and the wait time is ridiculous. I took my husband here (my third time) and we waited 45 minutes for two bowls and there were maybe five of us in the store. I asked after about half an hour of waiting when our order would come and the response was \"they're finishing it right now,\" fifteen minutes later and other customers who came in after us were walking out with bowls and we still didn't have our order. We ended up asking for a refund (which they didn't know how to do) and then left. I would like to give this place more stars because it tastes great but customer service and efficiency needs work."}
{"text":"I live in the West Valley and have to say that this is a restaurant that was worth stopping at (especially if you're in the area anyway.) They have a wide variety of smoothies, juices and smoothie bowls that are plantbased, fresh and delicious. I wish there was another location closer to where I live. A larger location to accommodate more people would be great, but you can get your orders to go which is nice. Customer service was pretty good, and their menu items are kid-friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great friendly service! Love their unique drink menu, and $2 cold brew?! Perfect for this brutal summer heat. I recommend their avocado toast with housemade vegan cheese, topped with mixed greens, smashed avocado, vine ripen tomatoes, and a dash of seasoning. YUM-O! The Black Sunshine lemonade with activated charcoal was light and simply refreshing! Thanks friends! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I visited Coconut Hut while visiting AZ. Let me start by saying the young man (owners brother) was very very kind. I originally came in wanting an Acai Bowl but was convinced into trying the Pitaya Bowl. I must say the Traditional Pitaya was excellent the agave and coconut chips were scarce but the overall flavor was good. I was told how great the pancakes were so I decided to come back the next day and this is where it gets tricky.   When I walked in there was no greeting and the guy with a ponytail was face-timing someone and he quickly put up the \"hold on\" finger. A young lady was summoned to take my order. I asked for the pancakes NOT KNOWING or being told that there were two sizes( i found this out later after seeing the reviews and looking at the menu). The guy with the ponytail stepped outside and when he returned he walked right in the kitchen and began prepping fruit and pouring my pancake batter.   My Buckwheat pancakes were served. They look excellent however they didnt really have a taste and i couldn't eat 4, i wish i was told there were two options a short stack and tall stack.  i gave the rating of three for the lack of friendly service the second day, The lack of hand washing, cost for serving amount, and the taste overall.   Would i return ? Yes, but only for an Acai or Pitaya Bowl."}
{"text":"Nice, little, quick stop for some quality food! Cool, easy-going and helpful owner and nice island vibe inside.  Great organic smoothies and juices and yummy raw/vegan/gluten-free lunch/dinner options! The breakfast bowls look amazing as well! If I lived in AZ, I'd probably stop here daily!"}
{"text":"We ordered 1 juice and 2 smoothies and it took 30 min. If you have all day to wait for something to eat/drink go here. The people working were avoiding us and I'm pretty sure they were all stoned.  The inventory looks like it's been picked over and I'm guessing this place is closing down soon.  I am always all for supporting local and typically would choose local over a chain but this place has crappy service and am disappointed in the execution of their expensive food so not worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love their acai bowls, buckwheat pancakes, zucchini pasta, and excited to try everything else. They have many more meals on their in store menu than they list online. Hopefully they update that soon. I'm grateful to have such a healthy eatery nearby. Thank you Coconut Hut!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from Portland, and I was enthralled to find a vegan place in the area. When I ordered the zucchini pasta, the young girl working the till told me I made a great choice and she really liked that dish. After ordering, I sat down at a table and waited for my food. Forty-five minutes had passed, I was the only one in the restaurant for a majority of that time, and I still had not received my food. After waiting for a ridiculous amount of time, I went up to the front counter and asked the man working if my dish will be done soon. He yelled, \"We don't have zucchini!\" and proceeded to go in the back to yell at the other employees. I am not exactly sure how they could lose an order like this, especially when I only saw about 4 other customers during my long 45-minute wait. I was disappointed that I had just wasted my time there. They gave me my money back and two coupons for free smoothies, but I am not exactly sure I want to return. If you are debating on going here, I unfortunately do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I love the açaí, the workers were extremely nice and was very clean. I will diffidently be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and have always loved what I have gotten. The customer service is great and the owners are very friendly. I love their pitaya bowl and their smoothies. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Sustenance for your healthy lifestyle!  Enjoy tropical music and smoothies to accompany your beach fantasy while you are in the middle of the Sonoran desert. Tip: take your treat half a block away to savor it by one of Gilbert's lakes."}
{"text":"I really love this place, I make my own acai bowls at home and this place is the best one to homemade bowls I can get. It seems to me they use a powder and not a sorbet like most places so it's not full of sugar! I like that they actually make it healthy with superfoods and don't use things with processed ingredients. You can also choose what liquid you want (coconut milk, hemp, almond etc) which is another awesome thing! I've only been here twice but both times the staff was really friendly. I think the prices are great considering how much superfoods cost. It doesn't take 2 mins to make a bowl so if you're fine waiting a little for a delicious thing I'd highly recommend coming here. They also have happy hour from 11am-2pm Monday thru Friday."}
{"text":"This place is a mixed bag. The food is vegan and the owner seems nice but my daughter and I have gone here several times with extremely inconsistent food prep quality and customer service. I've had perfectly cooked pancakes with fruit on the side and on a separate visit had burnt pancakes that took way too long (probably because they were burning)  with no fruit .. Last time we were there they brought out her bowl 15 minutes before bringing my pancakes.. Really?? This is customer service 101. Bring customers food out at the same time so they can eat together!"}
{"text":"Only place I've found that sells delicious acai bowls & all organic! Absolutely love it! Definitely recommend it to everyone. Also very clean nice place and friendly employees. Can never go wrong with this place. (:"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this place! Healthy, yummy, lunch and smoothies in a really nice atmosphere. The people behind the counter were really nice too. Yay for me! I used to have to drive to Mesa to get a lunch this healthy."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Giving this 5 stars for the P&B Acai bowl! This is a MUST try - hands down the best acai bowl I've ever had! I've also had the tropical tacos which at a bit hard to eat. I love the vibe! If you live in the Islands, this is a great, healthy little spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Wow so good! The acai bowls were so good!!!! Amazing and taste so good and health so going back for more acai bowls!! Good for the summer!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted something healthy and really quick... I was on the go. I got oatmeal and I LOVE oatmeal. I paid over 5 dollars to get only two toppings. Two of which I was told they DIDNT have until after I paid. It took about 15 mins. I got in the car to eat it. There were a very small amount of toppings. The oats were good. Halfway done and there was a curly hair. Gross. Super sad."}
{"text":"Delicious açaí bowls.    Friendly staff.     Frequented by angry faced yuppies, but that makes sense as it is an $8 bowl of fruit."}
{"text":"By far the greatest place to get an acai bowl fast and amazing customer service. Worth my drive there!"}
{"text":"I had such an awesome experience coming here, employees were super nice and knowledgeable, they helped me pick a bowl out since it was my first time. It was way better than I thought it would be, will def be back to try their vegan food!"}
{"text":"Fun decor, with a very casual and friendly vibe! Great for studying and smoothie dates!   I got the Green Açai bowl, with almond milk and honey. Really delicious and super filling!!! Heard great things about the coconut mango cream, and I can't wait to try it the next time I come in!  Everything is organic and super fresh! No added sugars or anything! Super excited to live by such an awesome place! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, their smoothies  and juices  for awesome , friendly staff, tiny seating choices. Very beginning  and  seemed  everything was made from scratch  which we totally loved. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"When I visited this place I wanted to like it but my acai bowl was pretty bland and tasteless. The original cashier that helped me was nice but the guy with the pony tail was rude toward me and my friend. While they have a great selection on their menu, their customer service wasn't too great. I posted a previous review about what happened, but it was removed by Yelp so I'm posting this simpler version. Thanks."}
{"text":"Spotted this place from a sign they had on the corner of Warner and McQueen. This is the definition of a hidden gem. Tucked way back into the strip mall, it's a beacon of goodness waiting to tantalize your tastebuds! Acai bowls that give even the one's I've had in Maui a run for their money. They also have smoothies, dragon fruit bowls, and tons of other menu options for vegans, vegetarians, and simply anyone who cares about what goes into their body. The place is quaint, and had a tv with video games for my two boys to entertain themselves with. My son also discovered a house guitar that he practiced on while we waited for our bowls. I cannot wait to go back and give their breakfast and lunch a try. If they were in a better location, like Dana Park or downtown Gilbert, this place would have endless lines. I really cannot believe I didn't find this place sooner. Looking forward to spreading word about it."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for healthy, mostly raw, whole food plant based meals. If you're into that sort of thing this place will be delicious. As far as I can tell there is no added salt or sugar in the ingredients. The green burger is good, but I'd prefer added salt and more sauce. The chili was my favorite, very hearty, but again I'd prefer added salt and even though it was spicy, it needed some tang (from tomato or hot sauce or something). The desserts were raw and \"healthy\" as well - dates, nuts, cacao, and probably coconut oil. All items were nicely prepared/presented and the prices were very reasonable. And even though I obviously am addicted to added salt, I have still enjoyed our meals here."}
{"text":"If you want high quality organic food, this place is for you. Coconut Hut offers smoothies, acai & pitaya bowls, organic coffee & tea as well as other options.   I stop in here about 2 times per week to get coffee and some breakfast on the way to Funktional Fitness where I work. There are times when I don't have time to make breakfast and I was thrilled this place opened. Makes it easy for me to stop in and know I'm fueling my body with the best food.   Hooray for the Coconut Hut!"}
{"text":"Delicious and refreshing!   I got the Coconut Pitaya Bowl. The banana, strawberry and coconut was super fresh and beautifully arranged on top.  Just below this was a sweet, crunchy granola topping that gave this bowl a nice texture. I had mine made with coconut water and honey. I could eat this every day!  Staff was nice and laid back. I didn't feel ignored."}
{"text":"I love this place! My first time here today! I wanted a light and healthy breakfast to start my day off! The young lady Taylor was so helpful and pleasant she helped me pick out a yummy smoothie the choco- cherry and a coconut bowl! Thanks for the great experience! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I love acai bowls and was hoping for something a little more flavorful. The chili smell upon walking in to an acai bowl place was not my favorite! The positive: they do offer gluten free granola as well as diary free options."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and good vibe. A little on the pricy side but food is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm here at the coconut hut and it is the third time I've been here because I love their fresh pressed juice. There is no line like at Whole Foods and it is less expensive AND its service with a smile.  The owner is cool and the place has a tropical island/surfer decor.  I haven't tried some of the other items like the smoothies or Acai bowls which look great. Id recommend this place especially if you like all natural organic ingredients."}
{"text":"Just found this place today not my neighborhood but was closeby and it sounded yum.  So glad i did!! Food is really good Got limeade drink in pink and a veg sandwich. Came w carrots celery applecut up for dipping in their vegan ranch dip I could be happy w that alone but the sandwich was delish and filling.   Took half home and cannot wait to get back and try the rest!!!  Good clean food"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and have gotten the peanut butter acai bowl each time. It is SO good. If you love peanut butter, definitely give it a try! This place has a TON of options and I can never seem to break away from that one - but one of these days I will. My mom and aunt both get the green acai bowl (\"healthier\" than my PB one apparently) and love it. It's a little dinky shop that most probably miss, but totally worth stopping in. They have more than just the acai bowls but that's all I've had so I can't vouch for the rest, but I'm sure it's all tasty!"}
{"text":"Pricey but they are allowed to be! They are one of a kind! Loved it! Very hippie lol and they have a cute kids area!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to check out whether you are vegan or not. They have amazing food that will nourish you. I tried the Green Burger and it was delicious, filling, and healthy. I can't wait to come back and try their smoothies and bowls!   The staff is very inviting and welcoming. They also have a great playlist rolling at all times :) check this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here twice now and I could go here everyday. This place reminds me of Bowl of heaven in California, but this place has a larger variety. The first time I came I had the Pitaya Bliss smoothie and it was delicious. The 24 oz. Filled me up. The color of the drink was beautiful and the taste was even better. My second time here I got the strawberry raspberry and I liked it, but liked the Pitaya better. We also got the P.B. & Acai bowl. The bowl had a good portion of p.b. that made the bowl filling. The granola is a good airy crunch to this. The banana and honey were great toppings.  I would recommend this place to anyone that wants local and organic smoothies, bowl and food. Great pricing for great food and drinks! Looking forward to spending a lot of money here. :)"}
{"text":"I come in here at least 1-2 times a week. I don't know if I'll be going back anymore. Last time I went It was my day off. I wanted to sit there and enjoy my food in their restaurant. Despite me correcting the boy who was taking my ordering by say \"no, I wanted that for here\" 3 times, he still made my order Togo. It's not a big deal to me to eat out of a Togo container inside the restaurant, why would it be? This just showed me that he wasn't listening or even cared. I asked if I was given my $1 off my order since it was happy hour and was told I did after I I had swiped my card. But see, this doesn't add up, menu said my item was $11, my total came out $13.somthing, so I either paid 3$ in tax on a 10$ tab or they just lied about giving me my 1$ off. Which one is the obvious one?  Today it wasn't my day off. I went in before work and ordered a tropical  Açai bowl blended with apple juice and granola on the side. I Was given a  tropical pitaya bowl blended with coconut milk and given NO granola. Once again, wasn't listening to what it was I wanted. It was a shame, I didn't even get to eat what I paid 13$ for because I didn't like it. And I didn't like it, because it wasn't at all what I ordered. I'm a broke broke college student. Coconut hit is a treat for myself. That was really upsetting."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had the green açaí & the green wrap - seriously so good. The staff and owner were so friendly & helpful. This place is one of those quality local businesses that I am so happy to support & fortunate to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"$9 +tax for a 16oz juice?! Holy cow!!! Waaaaay too expensive for what you get for juice. Not good.  I understand it's organic but what's the point if it's too expensive for anyone but the really well-off to buy consistently? Just a luxury that's out of reach for most..."}
{"text":"The owners always shop at my store and also friend of mine too, I'm not vegan or vegetarian but i love to eat healthy and also be part of any taste. First time I went there it was my birthday 3 week ago, I had a vegan taco and a berry blast smoothie. I was impressed with the foods he make and so much healthier. The owner was really friendly when I walked in and their smoothies is so much healthier and fresh for my post workout routine. I would recommend for all the vegan or vegetarian lovers, or just want to eat delicious healthy foods to try this"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here I ordered the zucchini pasta and it was superb the portions are large so i ended up taking half of it home but very delightful in taste and in the appearance I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"First time I have been to somewhere that's all organic! I had a smoothie, the first one on the smoothies menu. Can't recall all that's in it. My son had a juice. For these 2 items cane to 18.00 with out a tip. Splendid place To try!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome, healthy, earth friendly shop. Everyone is super nice & the food & smoothies/juices/coffees are all vegan & delicious! Great find!"}
{"text":"I've been to Coconut Hut twice. The energy and vibe are amazing. You walk in and feel relaxed and at peace. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. I've had the Traditional Pitaya Bowl and the Pitaya Limeade. Both were delicious. My 12 year old daughter is vegan and this place is an awesome and cool place for her to treat herself. I highly recommend this place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place every morning for the past week! It's sooo good. I have been looking for a healthy smoothie place that's not Jamba Juice but tastes great and I was so happy I discovered this place! The owner is super nice and fun to talk to and it is like a little escape from the Arizona heat. I get the coconut mango cream smoothie (which has vanilla protein in it!!!) and it's a GREAT way to start my day! I HIGHLY recommend this place. They have such a good selection and such great customer service!"}
{"text":"My green burger was undercooked and mushy. The vegetables looked like they were cut the day before being dry. My friends Açaí bowls were flavorless, sour and melted quickly. When we walked in we were thrown off by the no refund sign on the register but now we understand. We just wasted 30 dollars here and still needed food afterwards."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Checked whether or not I enjoyed my dish, the stuffed portobello, and if I was doing alright. Casual joints rarely care about their customers but I can tell this is a family/private owned place because of the good customer service. My stuff portobello was surprisingly sweet. A little too much for a savory dish but I went with it. I also got the green juice but it tasted like there were more apples than I would've liked because it was also too sweet.  I usually like my green juices pretty green and earthy and less sweet. I'm sure most customers like the sweetness it had.  Will be back again though! I like the green acai bowl I got last time though :)"}
{"text":"We've only tried their acai bowls, but they were wonderful.  The owner is way cool & so is the staff.  It's a hidden treasure. It's a super chill place with really cool people."}
{"text":"I ordered an acai bowl... There was literally no one else in the entire building, yet it took eighteen minutes for it to be put on the counter, without even an apology or acknowledgement for the amount of time that had passed. An older man who I assumed was the owner was quite pretentious when I ordered, and he seemed a little too invested in the conversation with his much younger female employee. Both of them seemed annoyed when I asked for a to go cup, as if I was interrupting their conversation. The acai bowl was awesome, but I couldn't believe the wait time for it. The customer service (or lack of) definitely detracted from the whole experience."}
{"text":"The bowl was great. The green burgar was not firm. You have to eat it like an open face sandwich. The taste was good. Celery and carrots not the freshest. They did replace celery with some that was fresher. Didn't have a smoothie this time but they are good.   I would say you definitly can't go wrong with a bowl."}
{"text":"The staff was really friendly and helpful, but the bowl was awful! It's like they blend it with ice so as you are eating it, you are chewing on ice. The base of the bowl should NOT be crunchy. Being that I just moved here I thought it might be just an AZ thing but everyone I asked said that no blending bowls with ice is weird. It waters down the flavors and you can't taste anything but ice. The prices here are way too expensive for a bowl of blended ice. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place thee stars because there's no 2.5.  The food was alright.  Not amazing.  I ordered a burrito with a clever name I have already forgotten.  With avocado it was 11 dollars, my girlfriend ordered oatmeal bowl it looked amazing and did taste good. Just was a little overpriced at 8 dollars.  It was just oatmeal and honey with fruit. Im vegetarian so I try all these new hipster joints.  I'm a little to old I guess at 33 but they all seem to have way to many employees.  There were at least 4 workers in this little place and it took a while to get our food. The cashier seemed to be in a poor mood..   I'm going to keep trying but I still think the best vegan food is found in the Thai and other Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a rare find in the middle of the hot desert! I love the juices, bowls, smoothies and the great food! And it's so cool to hang out in the surf shack and shoot the breeze with Des and Sheridan! Love it!"}
{"text":"Why the hell is this place rated so highly? It's WILDLY overpriced and it is the most bland thing I have ever had the discomfort of slithering down my throat. It is so overpriced, that if you want to switch what kind of liquid you want in your bowl (default is coconut milk) to apple juice, it costs you TWO EXTRA DOLLARS. You could literally buy a whole gallon of apple juice for two dollars.  The only thing that tasted good was the bananas. I paid ten bucks for 10 minutes of my life to be overwhelmed by disappointing, brain freeze inducing, banana palette cleanser.  Just go buy a banana and a jug of apple juice from safeway. At least you'll have a more enjoyable time looking at the well kept shelves of safeway then the dirty, unclassy, faded purple wall-ed, musky,  buzz-of-fruit-flies-in-your-eyes ambiance at Coconut Hut."}
{"text":"The acai and pitaya bowls were not impressive. To start, there was barley anything in the bowls! The small was TINY and the acai barley even covered the bottom of it. Secondly, the granola is more like oats. There isn't even a taste to it. Very disappointing, I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing chill place, everything is fresh and organic and worth the price, great people who work there too! This was my first time there and they helped me pick out a pitaya for my liking"}
{"text":"Super organic,  vegan cute cafe with tons of options of acai bowls, smoothies, lunch and breakfast menus,  and even coffee and dessert!! I had a small coconut acai bowl and added chia seeds and ordered it with coconut milk.  Yum! Can't wait to come back to satisfy my hankering for vegan dishes."}
{"text":"Sooooo tasty! This place is tucked in the back corner of a pretty vacant strip mall but the acai bowls are amazing and super fresh"}
{"text":"Incredible customer service! Love their Acai Bowl! Definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love getting a little of my childhood in Brazil here, and even better, ALL organic. The coconut açaí bowl is my favorite. Any juices and smoothies I've had have been amazing, as well.   As far as food goes... Yum. If you're vegan, especially raw vegan, this is the place for you. Their stuffed mushrooms are SO GOOD.   The owners are friendly and knowledgeable. I was fortunate to have searched for a place like this the day after they posted their location on Google. I've been a frequenter ever since."}
{"text":"Just had a delicious mango, coconut butter smoothie. Happy to find this little Healthy gem."}
{"text":"I got the coconut Açaí bowl, and it was simply delicious. It tasted very fresh and looked beautiful. It was a little pricey with it in the coconut (about $15), but the taste was great."}
{"text":"Their pictures look so delicious so I really wanted to try it out!   So I definitely think that they are a bit overpriced. I ordered the coconut acai and I wanted it in a coconut so it was an additional $4. So basically $14 for my acai bowl! it was good, but I don't think it was $14 worth. It comes with strawberries, bananas, coconut butter, mango, coconut milk. There was only two people working there so the service was a bit slow.   It was really good and refreshing, but definitely over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"First of all the owner Deleslie (not sure if I spelled correct) she is a super sweetheart and is very helpful with the menu. I ordered the coconut pitaya and my son ordered the PB Acai, all I can say is... love love love!! The ingredients are so fresh and healthy, the organic peanut butter is to die for and the overall experience was delightful! We also ordered the vanilla Mint green tea and the white coconut tea, which are delicious.  If your into health foods like we are, your going to love this place, trust me you won't be disappointed!  Plan to make another visit tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Five star for the PB and Açaí! My husband and I shared the medium size bowl and it was perfect for a morning snack. The shop was cute with a small seating area and toys for the kids to play. We will definitely be back. I found my new açaí bowl spot!"}
{"text":"Chickpeas \"scrambled egg\" burrito with Coco green smoothie.  A little pricey,but great flavors.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and I'll definitely be back! The acai bowl was amazing! I wish I lived closer, or else I'd be there every day. I love the atmosphere and decor. I think it's really great that there's a compost bucket and that the spoons are compostable! Not a lot of restaurants offer that, so it was nice to see. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to visit this adorable little restaurant last Saturday while promoting Shop Small Saturday with American Express. I fell in love with the owner and her staff. Everyone was friendly, and attentive. I went with a group of friends, so we ordered quite a few items on the menu.  Two highly recommended items on the menu are 1. Coconut acai bowl (pretty much any combo will make you happy) 2. Smoothie served in young coconut (all flavors are delicious) Overall, I love the friendly atmosphere, and the cool vibes at this place. I will definitely be back with a few of my girlfriends for sure. Give this place a visit if you are in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place was so cool!! I had a coconut water in a fresh coconut, avocado toast, and the coconut pitaya bowl. My family had the chocolate acai bowl and buckwheat pancakes. We loved it! The service was great and it was a nice treat on a warm day for a late brunch. I love that there is a Nintendo Sega in here!! And I love that it's such a homey spot from the great service to the homemade signs! I totally get why ppl are obsessed with smoothie bowls now!"}
{"text":"First time here and it is going to be my new little spot. Great prices! Nice atmosphere and neat little health spot. Spoke with the owner I believe and he was so nice. Can't wait to try more of their smoothies and bowl options!"}
{"text":"Great happy friendly service and even better food.  My superfood pitaya bowl was outta this world good!"}
