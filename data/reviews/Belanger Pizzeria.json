{"text":"Petite pizzéria typique de quartier. Service rapide et courtois. J'ai commandé une small 11\" végétarienne et je n'ai pas été déçue. La croute était croustillante, plusieurs légumes dont olives, brocoli, olives, zucchini. Bref j'ai adoré!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, crispy veggies, good tasting sauce on a nice thin crust. Kinda homemade fries also really good.   I am not ordering pizza often because most of the time, I am disapointed. But the one at Belanger Pizzeria worth it. Enjoy! ^___^"}
{"text":"Ordered XL pizza and two cans on coke using Just Eat. Recieved one can of coke (but was charged for two) and the pizza wasn't even cut! That's the worst part. Who sends out an uncut pizza?!  Thankfully, the pizza tastes pretty good. Could have used another couple of minutes in the oven though."}
