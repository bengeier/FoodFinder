{"text":"This restaurant is quite nice, serving both Japanese and Korean food but in good quality. Especially like the sashimi and special rolls there. Worth to come back definitely."}
{"text":"Tried Toro Sushi at lunch time. All 4 in our party had a lunch combo for 14.95. Food was really good and lots of it.  My combo was a dynamite roll ( big shrimp), Bulgogi (tender slices of fresh beef) and tempura (2 good sized shrimp, squash and yam) with rice. The place was renovated from the old place and looks contemporary and seating is well spaced. Service was fast and pleasant. Definitely recommend. Will check in here again when the place is not so new."}
{"text":"The service is superb!  They food is nice and fresh.  I love that they have lots of variety of choices and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, fair prices.   Sushi was fresh and tasted great. Ordered various Dragon rolls and was impressed - both presentation and quality wise.   Ordered bim bim bap and thought it was average (not a bad thing). We also had the Korean pancake and was pleasantly surprised - probably one of the best that I've ever had (light and fluffy).   Would return again and would recommend, particularly if you want an alternative to AYCE joints in the area."}
{"text":"It was my first time here with my family today. We were welcomed as soon as we stepped foot into the restaurant.   We were greeted with a friendly hello and we were seated at our table. Since it was our first time there we took longer than usual in ordering. The waitress was very informative in explaining to us about the menu...sometimes a bit too friendly lol  Our food came and it was really good. I ordered a Pork Bone soup and it was delicious. The sushi was also really fresh too.   Oh an because they just opened they gave our table a plate of oysters for free which I thought was quite nice.   When we left we were once again greeted with a warm goodbye. Will definitely go back again  The reason I didn't give them a full 5 stars was because I felt that the rice for the sushi could've been stickier. I felt that it all fell apart quite easily once I picked it up with my chopsticks."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The decor is more modern than your typical Japanese restaurant. Their food is filling and tasty. Their prices isn't the cheapest but it doesn't break the bank. The servers are native English speakers and attentive to your needs.  Overall, this is my GO TO Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"We came to eat here since it was a new restaurant. We ordered an appetizer, noodles, egg pudding, sashimi, and of course, sushi. The buzzer rang but nobody came so there goes one star! So we waved instead. Service is quick and no-nonsense, and we went to the bathroom and when we came back there was the egg pudding. It tasted bland but still I enjoyed it. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since it opened. We drove by and noticed the name change. I went in and grabbed a menu. Not AYCE?!  We still went there to eat that Sunday. I had the pork bone soup lunch special. They also have different combos, bento, and entrées you can choose from for the specials.  They give you a selection of appetizers (a number which has decreased since opening) which are yummy, miso soup, and salad. They have fountain drinks not included with meal but come with refills.  The service is good and attentive for the most part (Maybe because my mom made friends with the owner) even when I just go with my boyfriend. The restaurant itself is very clean and comfy, not grungy and dirty.  I realize this doesn't sound like a rave review, but actions speak louder than words...and since Toro has opened, I've been there more times than I can count.  Go try!  **I wish they served ramen."}
{"text":"I'm so glad the old sushi place got replaced by this one!  The portions are huge for the \"all the convo special\", which is basically choosing your own combination for a bento box.  It comes with miso soup and some kinda egg thing.  The spicy salmon sushi rolls were STUFFED with salmon. Woo too A+++!!! Te beef teriyaki was kinda dry and tasted like any other beef teriyaki.  The tempura was pretty good as well.  It's basically $15 for that plus tax and tips.   And since it's the grand opening, when you order $20 or more, you te two free oysters!! :D. It's $1 for each one after that up to the tenth one.  We were deciding on whether we should do that or not, but the oysters weren't that big so we didn't order it.  The service was fast, an they were all super friendly!   Let's hope they keep it that way."}
{"text":"New non ayce restaurant in the area - decor and atmosphere are quite nice. Restaurant is pretty empty on the few times I've visited, but the waitresses are fairly friendly and service is good. Each table has a button to press for service.   Lunch menu is around $8 - 15 and comprises of a fairly standard range of japanese/Korean food. I've tried both sushi rolls and Korean food. The sushi is fairly good, the Korean is average.   There are oysters for $1 each (min 6) but no variety and the waitress didn't know what kind of oyster it was - which is OK considering the price."}
{"text":"Came here for a nice little dinner. I ordered the Kalbi tang and the boyfriend ordered the sushi dinner. We were started off with miso soup and a savoury egg pudding. Very happy with the egg pudding, flavourful and a wonderful start to the meal. This was then followed by 5 banchan dishes, with the japchae and honey potatoes being my 2 favourite. Our meal also came with 2 complimentary oysters which were delicious. More so 'cause they were free. But this was a grand opening special so not sure if they still have it.   I felt my kalbi tang was ok. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The sushi my bf got was really fresh, but he had the unfortunate incident of getting piece with extra wasabi. Service wise everything was quite good and attentive. Our server made sure she let us know about any possible special we might've been interested in, which was nice.   Overall, it's more like a 3.5 for food quality, but with the amount of free food you get with your meal (excluding oysters, you still get the egg pudding and 5 banchans), I was able to leave super satisfied and felt like we got our money's worth. Will definitely return for their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Sushi - 2.5 stars & Korean dishes - 3.5 stars. Average of 3 stars.    SERVICE was excellent and fast. Servers and / or the owner checked in on us at least 5-6 times, no exaggeration. They really wanted to ensure we had everything we needed. A good sign for a new restaurant. Kudos to management.  SUSHI was a little disappointing in my opinion. Some of the best variety in Markham but it just didn't do anything for me. The rice was hard in some cases and tasted odd but not sure why. I didn't like the Soya sauce either. Fish was relatively fresh but rather thin.   NOTE - I eat sushi all over the city (often 2-3 times per week) - a 5 star rating for Toro is incredibly aggressive in my opinion but everyone has the right to their own opinion and I certainly respect that. Judge for yourself.    Non Sushi FOOD selections were much better, especially the Korean dishes. I enjoyed the Dduk Mandu Gook soup. A Korean soup including sliced rice cakes and dumplings. The Bulgogi was also very good - nice and tender and marinated thoroughly.  Toro is still NEW so I'm hoping there is some upside on the Sushi. Early problems are often unavoidable. It was very clear to me Toro is trying hard and I will definitely be back to try some other menu options.  Definite potential...  BK"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just came home from this place a few minutes ago, and I could barely wait to write my review to tell you all:  YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE!!   Recommended Dishes: - Spider Maki  - Softshell Crab appetizer  - Spicy Tuna Maki  - Lobster Tempura   They have doorbell device thingies at each table. When you press it, there is an indicator on the wall that shows the waitresses which table it came from, and they bee line towards you. The service was impeccable. Extremely friendly, efficient, detailed.   Ambiance is lovely. Prices are reasonable. The renovations gave the place a very open and airy feel.   Absolutely thrilled with my experience here. Go. Now. Ok bye! :)"}
{"text":"Better quality sashimi than most AYCE type of places, just as good value.  The sashimi combo contains a decent variety of fish and ebi, oysters we had were super fresh and juicy.  Saba mackerel was also nicely grilled.    Excellent black sesame ice cream; not so impressive lava cake, which tastes like a cupcake or a muffin with a dollop of green tea flavoured cream injected into the middle."}
{"text":"I came here today based on the stellar reviews.  I have to say, that it's definitely a step up from the previous AYCE sushi place, which I found to be less than extraordinary.   Atmosphere: 4/5 - modern and contemporary designs and comfy booths.  They have the call bells as well and if you hit them, someone will be there in less than 30 seconds.    Food/pricing:4/5 Looks like they do the Korean thing combined with the Japanese thing and serve banchan along with miso soup and Japanese salad.  Banchan included potato, bean sprout, and glass noddles.   Item 1: Caviar roll - fish egg, cream cheese, shrimp tempura bits and unagi sauce - 2.5/5 Rice was warm and fish eggs tasted good, but it didn't have any spark to it.    Item 2: 5/5 Salmon sashimi with nabe udon - lunch special for $13.95.  Sashimi was nice large pieces and very fresh.  The nabe udon was very light and flavourful.  It tasted very authentic and didn't seem to have to much MSG.    Service: 3/5 - I would give 4.5 for the friendliness but took full 30 minutes for all the dishes to come out.  Also, the bill came out before we got our entrees.   That was kind of weird, but I chalk it up to just some confusion.    Verdict: Would visit again.  One of the better non-AYCE joints in Markham."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch after seeing the number of good reviews here.  Husband and I ordered from the lunch special menu. He got the special with the choice of 3 standard rolls and I got the white beef bone broth.  The soup came out scorching hot in a stone bowl. Smell is good, like what a beef broth should be. However, I find the taste really bland. It taste like water. I'm not familiar with Korean food so I'm not sure if customer was suppose to add their own salt. It was a bit more enjoyable after adding in a fair amount of salt and black pepper from the table. Also, since the soup was served super hot with the beef pieces, the beef was too well done and rough for my liking. I would not order this dish again. I think for the price of $8.95, I would feel more satisfied with a bowl of good tasty pho.  The sushi rolls on the other hand was excellent. For the special, we chose the Dynamite roll, Unagi roll and Salmon Avocado roll. Simple, tasty and fresh. No complains.  The dining area is spacious and clean with modern décor and a number of comfortable booth seats. Washroom is clean and modern as well, with stylish chrome faucets and industrial style sink. The pot of fresh mums inside the ladies room was a nice touch and showed that they care about the place.  Service was also pleasant and professional.   I would come back again, but stick to the sushi next time."}
{"text":"A non-AYCE sushi place. The staff were extremely friendly. Food was delicious, the toro sashimi wasn't as good as I expected a bit chewy, but everything else(eel donburi, teriyaki chicken rice, sushi platter) were all really good.   Will prob go back to try their lunch special:)"}
{"text":"Looks like Toro is gone... There is a note on the door saying they didn't pay their rent.  Sad, I liked the place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Their grilled teriyaki salmon was a bit dry but the sushi was fantastic! you get what you pay for since this place is pricy but it's worth it. The waitresses are very nice and polite, it seems that they know their regulars well! Since we ordered so much, they provided us with fresh oysters which were so delicious!  Definitely recommend this place if you have the money for it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice,  with wildly different results.   The first time I came was excellent: I had the spicy tofu soup and it came with the complimentary oysters as others have mentioned and my mate had the kalbi.   Great service from the Korean owner.   Polar opposite my second time:  waitress with glasses who said we were entitled to miso soup and the manager had to correct her. Food itself was okay,  nothing to write home about.   Left with mixed feelings about the place,  probably won't go back j."}
{"text":"Service is great.  Parking is good.  I found that the interior lighting is a bit too dim though and the food...It could be better.  Sashimi was meh.  Soft-shell crab could have been more crispier.  The only dish I enjoyed was the Korean BBQ short ribs.  Sorry but I would rather go back to my favourite Osaka further east."}
{"text":"We tried to drop by today for lunch. Lo and behold the doors were closed. This is a Saturday afternoon. Has Toro closed their doors without warning?"}
{"text":"This is a non-AYCE Jap/Korean restaurant. Food quality is on par with your typical non-AYCE place. Great variety of items on the menu including a good selection of raw & cooked items, lots of specialty rolls and a few Korean dishes. Highs include the Lobster Lover Roll and sashimi(fresh). Lows are the poorly crafted Maki/ Uramaki rolls with soggy rice. Service is attentive and atmosphere is good as you would expect. Price point is average. Unlikely to revisit, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here again for dinner: 1.  Uni sushi - fresh and it's on special ($4.49 for an order of two) **Must try if you are uni lover ** 2.  Snow white roll - without rice and wrapped with crab meat salad instead.  Topped with white tuna. GREAT!!  Highly recommended! 3. Sam Gae Tang (Chicken Gingseng soup) - chicken with stuffed rice.  The soup is a bit salty.   4. Corn cream croquette - tasted like \"cream\" croquette.  Very creamy inside but not much corn. 5. Sashimi Deluxe - fresh and great price!  $24.95 for 20 pcs....... including a pc of monk fish liver!!  my FAV!!  This is the first restaurant which has ever come with monk fish liver in sashimi combo.  ** A star for the monk fish liver : )  Giving it 5 stars **"}
{"text":"Toro Sushi is an affordable non-AYCE sushi restaurant.  I had a lunch special here one Sunday.  We ordered one rainbow roll regular order ($13) and one bibimbap lunch special ($9). Both orders came with a miso soup and a starter salad.  The rainbow roll was beautifully presented (see picture), and it was tasty even without soy sauce and wasabi.  The rice was soft and the ingredients were fresh.  The bibimbap was served in a stone bowl, which was unusual at this price point in this neighbourhood.  It tasted quite good.  I liked the Korean chili sauce they provided, because it was undiluted unlike some places.  Even as lunch special, the bibimbap still came with 3 small Korean appetizers.    The services was pleasant.  The waitresses were polite.  They refilled the tea a few times.  They removed empty dishes promptly.  From the menu, most of the dinner regular items cost less $20.  I think we will return for some delicious and affordable dinners."}
{"text":"All the grand opening specials are gone :( They even took away the Korean side dishes that were given for free no matter what dish you ordered. And to make things even worse the menu has changed and many of the lunch combo's they had before either no longer exist or they have been jacked up in price. The only special which I thought was still considered a special is the $1 oysters but minimum 6 so its $6 for 6 oysters. This place use to be so packed during lunch time when they had all their grand opening specials but this time around there were only about 4-5 tables being served. The only positive thing is that the portions, quality and freshness of the fish are still the same. A lot of the value has been taken away and its just another Japanese Restaurant now in my opinion."}
{"text":"I definitely didn't get the service treatment everyone here seems to have mentioned, nevertheless the food I had was definitely top notch, and it's safe to say I now have a second a la carte sushi place to look forward to in addition to Osaka.  Items I had include the raw marinated beef (sounds a LOT better than it sounds!), seafood pancake (good if you like squid), smoked salmon roll, and sashimi A. The sashimi here is much better quality than the ones in Osaka, however Osaka has this place beat in rolls as I found them to be quite standard. Overall though I found this place to have better hot food selections, and they even offer those korean snacks (bean sprouts, kimchi, sweet potato).   The free oysters (x6) were definitely a plus, and tasted quite good after you add the lemon juice. The egg and miso soup were also quite decent (although the egg was too...slippery for me).  As for the service, we were ignored for about the first 10 minutes, until a lady finally came and took our order, except she never asked what drinks we wanted. Eventually we got our drinks after the first wave of food arrived.  A small fix in service and I'll definitely come back for the sashimi and hot food. I always have Osaka if I want unique rolls."}
{"text":"Been back after a couple of months and alot  have changed since then. Service was slow today at Toro. Took 10mins for someone to come by our table, with a pretty empty restaurant at 7pm.  The menu has changed alot. No more bentos for dinner just lunches and prices did go up. I was looking forward on having that oh so good bento box, sadly no luck for me... The food was still good and all but i didnt feel the love of Toro sushi when i first visited. It was kinda stale in my part. It felt so homey ... No... Mehhhh... I dont think i can recommend this restaurant anymore and i wont be back in a long time."}
{"text":"Visited here for the very first time over the weekend.  They're a Japanese/Korean restaurant, not a 100% authentic Japanese restaurant if thats what you're looking for.  My friends & I ordered several rolls to share (lunch special) and they were well proportioned, not too big, not too small.  Atmosphere is quite comfortable (a lot better than the previous AYCE design).  Servers were friendly, especially the owner always checking in on us.  Price is fair for lunch specials, appetizers are included as its a korean mixed restaurant."}
{"text":"I find these Korean based Japanese restaurants either a hit or miss (usually a miss). This one on the other hand turned out to be really good! It is definitely added as a close go-to place for non-ayce sushi / korean places on my list.  Came for dinner and it has a couple of, what I would consider the better choices, Korean appetizers. In addition they gave us a steamed egg which was silky smooth and probably used some seafood / chicken broth.  The sashimi deluxe menu item surprisingly came with monkfish and was quite fresh. Also had sweet shrimp hamachi and salmon belly.   The rolls were pretty good but I HAVE TO comment on the snow white roll. I thought there would be nothing innovative anymore in the realm of sushi rolls but this one had a new format that I thought worked very well. It had no rice or seaweed or rice paper. Used crab salad instead of the rice and packed it in with salmon and avocado. Topped with white tuna, I was surprised the roll stayed together and flavors worked out.  Anyways i would definitely give it a try if you haven't and are looking for some non-ayce choices and want some better fish quality than the ayce ones. P.S. The UNI was quite fresh as well and they have a special as shown in the pictures."}
{"text":"Relatively new restaurant so it's busy. Slow service and mediocre food. Once the initial hype is over, I'm sure this place would see fewer customers returning. Very loud atmosphere (think dim sum) and very dim dining area."}
{"text":"After all the turkey, roast beef and etc over the holidays, we had a craving for sushi and noticed the new Toro sushi sign. We decided to get it a try - it was an early dinner on boxing day.  Decor/Location: - Immediately after we walked in, we noticed the place was very nicely renovated and decorated with lots of dark wood. It had a feeling of us sophisticated sushi place downtown. - Inside is very big and probably good for large groups  Food: - There was extensive menu of japanese and korean food (more japanese than korean).  - We ordered: seafood pancake, classic dragon roll and fire caterpillar roll - For starters, they gave us 3 korean dishes (potatoes, fish cake and glass noodles) and even threw in steam egg dish. For the grand opening, there is a oyster special  where you get 2 oysters for over $20. This was a great start! - Seafood pancake was delicious - lots of seafood and fried nicely - Classic dragon roll - excellent - Fire caterpillar roll - this was my fav one. It was almost 1.5 rolls tall as they piled up spicy salmon on top of a dynamite roll wrapped in avocado. Yummy!  The two of us were quite stuffed and took half of the seafood pancake home. I have ordered a big party tray from them so another update coming soon.   All in all, it reminded of Gal's Sushi but inside was nicer and food a bit more fancier."}
{"text":"Our new go to sushi place. Phenomenal menu! Incredibly fresh ingedients! I liked that there was a wide variety of items to accommodate even my youngest child who isn't fond of sushi. She enjoyed the Korean short ribs and the Sweet and Spicy Chicken. The only thing that I can be critical of is that some items were a bit too salty (chicken wings, the miso soup and the noodles). It would be a five star rating if it wasn't for the saltiness of some of the menu items."}
{"text":"So this new place replaced the old sushi place so I decided to come in and try. I ordered the chirashi deleux.  So the meal starts off with some Korean starter. Not too bad and nothing special but then a bowl of chinese steam egg comes. Chinese steam egg, that's a dish I have a bowl of Chinese rice, why is this part of the starter?  After the starter, the chrashi came, and it looks pretty nice, filled with sushi rice and fresh sushimi. Some expensive sushimi is in here too.   The key to good Japanese is freshness and they have that here."}
{"text":"After reading everyone's raving reviews, I decided to give this place a try. After months of piggying out on AYCE restaurants, Toro reminded me how good non-AYCE quality really is.  Tuna tataki was A-OK. Tender pieces of raw tuna bedded on top of shredded radish along drenched with seasoned soy sauce.  Sashimi pieces were generous, the variety was not bad at all, they have sweet shrimp sashimi   rolls were ginormus!! it's not over stuffed with rice, but over loaded with ingredients YUMMMM!!  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Toro Sushi is definitely a welcome replacement of the previous AYCE restaurant.  A complete renovation of the interior giving the place a much modern vibe.   Food wise is A-OK with a choice of Japanese and Korean item on the menu, for sure you can find something that you like even if you are not into sushi.  Lunch Special daily till 3 pm with prices starting at $8.95.  LS1 Sushi Lunch ($10.95) and LS10 Beef Bone Broth ($8.95) were decent. The sushi was nicely plated, unfortunately the Beef Bone Soup was not hot enough even when serving in a hot bowl.   Toro Sushi is a nice addition to the neighbourhood. A great option for lunch or dinner if you are in the area.  Grand Opening Special for Oyster. Maybe I go for some oyster next time!"}
{"text":"The signage (Toro Sushi) on the front of the restaurant is not illuminated and the whole area outside the restaurant is really dark. They should consider changing their sign so it lights up. Without the \"Open\" sign, it was hard to tell they were actually open in the dark. The inside looks gorgeous though. Love the cleanliness and overall design of the place.  The prices are definitely not that expensive for the quality of food you get. The servers were friendly and professional. All of our food came extremely fast with free appetizers to start (egg pudding (very soft), bean sprouts, potatoes with sauce, japchae and miso soup). I wasn't a fan of the miso soup but at least it wasn't lukewarm.  We tried the uni sushi and one pc. also came with our 20pc. premium sushi. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was certainly up there in terms of quality. Also, the ikura in particular was very good quality.   Our special combo dinner also came with lobster tempura and kalbi. The tempura was not overly crispy and crunchy like other places. It felt fluffy and melted right into my mouth along with the delicious lobster. I would highly recommend their tempura in general. The kalbi was fantastic because it wasn't fully cooked (medium rare) on the inside. This made it very tender and easy to cut and chew.   We also ordered the chicken teriyaki. Compared to the rest of the food it was a disappointment because of the blandness in the chicken. Their rice helped us finish the generous helping of chicken though. The portions of food were reasonable with the price.  Looking forward to coming here again. It felt like a treat to eat such high quality food!"}
