{"text":"Updated review....  I had (and may still have depending on my next visit) a love-hate relationship with this place, but I come here once in a while since I work nearby. The staff was hit and miss, seems like eveytime I was coming they would mess up the order, take too long, or just not really care.  I haven't been in a long time, but just went recently and things have turned around.  The staff seems to know what they are talking about,  they are nice and friendly.  Of course the food is quite good, very yummy and that hasn't changed.  So i changed my rating from 2 stars to 4.   Here's my original review.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ehh... go somewhere else... or get it togo.   Not gonna lie the prices are kinda high.   The staff is rude, in fact VERY RUDE. Sad part the owners are the worst ones there.      The only good part is the food, it's great.  I love the turkey and swiss croissant with raspberry sauce.  yummy!   Grilled Cheese is AMAZING especially with the tomato soup.   Like the other reviews say, the cookies are to die for.   Some other notes:    Tht e place is kinda small, so they are real picky who eats at the tables.  You are NOT allowed to go to the counter and order food then sit at the tables. They are pretty prompt to kick you out of the seats even though you are a paying customer.    They get 2 stars instead of 1 simply because of their food."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  I have yet to have ANYTHING that was less than delicious.  Their stuffed croissant sandwiches are perfectly made every time, crispy and tasty.  This is a coffee shop...I've never had the coffee, but we end up here for lunch several times a week- they have a full lunch menu, mostly sandwiches, but you can't go wrong with any of them.  If I've put on any weight lately (likely) its because they are very good bakers here, their muffins and especially their chocolate chip cookies (ask for them warmed, if they aren't already, early morning muffins are always warm and freshly baked on site).  Amazingly good.    I give them less than five stars for one reason:   their prices are a bit steep for the area.  But its good.  I'll be going back very soon."}
{"text":"I love this place; killer baked goods. I've been going since the Scottsdale days and it's still as good as it always was.   And to Sara, I've always had pleasant experiences there-especially with the owners. Maybe YOU'RE the problem.  Just sayin..."}
{"text":"Very good food... Service is rather snotty.  I've had things thrown in bags and never a thank you.  I've waiting 10 minutes for soup with nobody in the place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for lunch! I get the veggie sandwich every time and it comes with a side salad. Plenty of food for a good price. The multigrain bread is delicious and the honey mustard dressing can't be beat. The place is kind of small but during nice days there is a lot of seating outside."}
{"text":"I have been going to Romancing the Bean for about 15 years now, back when they were at the Pavilions and have followed them to this new location.  I live off of the 101 and 7th Ave and I make the drive out there because they have the best coffee and freshest baked goods in town.  I especially love the cream cheese muffins!   The first thing that hits you as you enter is the smell!  Breathing in the tantalizing aroma of baked foods and tantalizing coffee, how could anyone resist the temptation to buy a coffee and a treat?  I know I can't! The price of coffee drinks and food are very reasonable.  They have homemade muffins, cookies, croissants, and soups that are fresh each morning; you don't find that in to many coffee shops.   In most coffee shops you find bagels, muffins, and pre-made salads that are delivered from somewhere else and that stay on the shelves for a couple of days.  Which would you rather have? Me, I'd rather pay a little more for great coffee and fresh food than go to shops with prepackaged items and inferior coffee. Romancing the Bean also has wonderful people working there. They provide a friendly atmosphere all the time.  It is a family owned business and that is what it feels like when you walk in the door.  Romancing the Bean is a truly delightful place to visit."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and efficient servers, desserts are to die for. I have been coming here for the last 26 years."}
{"text":"This place is alright if you're desperate for something nearby and have no other option.  The lady that owns it is beyond rude.  First I thought it was just her RBF, but no, she's rude.  I've noticed that if you're not one of her \"favorites\" she will just stare right through you; will not even acknowledge you; could not care less about you.  Many of the employees take the same stance - it's as if you're not even there.  If you're a regular, they'll stop and chit chat with you and all that jazz, while ignoring everyone else.  The owner (Luanne her name is?) sits on her arse most of the time taking up one of very few seats where I could be sitting while waiting for my food, which seems to take foooorrrreeeeeeeeever.  She sits there and shoots the breeze with her favorites.  Most employees move around the tight space literally bumping into you and shoving their way through - again, it's like I'm invisible or something!!  The service is, in general, just awful.  There are a couple of employees there that are usually okay, but...  sheesh.    The food is hit or miss.  I've had very good stuff, and also some awful stuff.  The stuffed croissants are pretty good, and the pastries are spot on.  The cookies, if you don't mind consuming a day's worth of calories in one cookie, are out of this world.  Not sure if there's a pound of butter, pound of sugar, pound of crack, or some combination thereof, but those cookies are totally worth it.  The sandwiches are usually decent, as are the (small portioned/overpriced) soups.  Try the green chili soup - tasty, just too small.  The taco salad is horribly disgusting - don't even try.  A Caesar salad I ordered was - without a doubt - the worst I've ever had (read: soggy lettuce, soaked with Caesar dressing) - I threw it away after one bite).    Coffee items are just okay; I've had decent drinks there and some watered down nastiness.  I've never tried any of their custom/artisanal brews since it's not my thing, though some of them sound good.    In summary, the service is generally slow and disrespectful in a small cramped space.  Food is so-so: if you know what to order, you can have success; if you're rolling the dice, you have a good chance of being disappointed.  This place exists primarily because of a captive audience (only place on the block without walking a few blocks away) to the office buildings there.    I would strongly suggest these guys step up their game, as there are tons of us waiting, just waiting, for some other place to open up on the block so we can have a better option.  As for me, this place is now in the \"for emergency only\" category."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of this cafe for about a year. The food is excellent. I especially love the rooibus iced teas, peach muffins, soups, and chocolate chip oatmeal cookies.  Everything is super fresh. Lots of regulars from the Hayden Ferry buildings that seem like their \"bread and butter\" clientele. Personally, have never had a customer service issue and I frequent there about once per week. Only wish they were open Saturdays so I could stop by after my Tempe Town Lake walk or A Mountain hike."}
{"text":"I go here for a quick snack, occasional breakfast, lunch, and coffee pretty often. I work in the Hayden Ferry Lakeside building, so swinging by \"the Bean\" is really convenient and quick.   I've been a frequent customer for just over 2 years now. Luanne and Robert are the owners, and really make a point to get to know their frequent customers. They care about whats going on in your life, always smiling, and even the staff has fun at work and remembers what you order.   Every day there is a new special (only open M-F). Sloppy Joes is amazing. I used to get them every thursday for months. Lemon bars, chocolate croissant, chocolate chip muffins, oatmeal cookies, cake slices, yoghurt parfait, and other desserts/ are SO good.   Love this place :)"}
{"text":"The mom-and-pop coffee shop (hey, that rhymes) Romancing the Bean is quietly located near Tempe Town Lake and specializes in baked croissant sandwiches, huge cookies and espresso.  To get the negatives out of the way first, the place is a PITA to find the first time, and the short term parking is expensive.  The coffee wasn't anything outstanding, but it wasn't bad either.  But the atmosphere is great, the shop itself is immaculate, the staff were all very nice and the cinnamon twist thing I ate was insanely delicious.  There is also free WiFi.  This is a great place if you are looking to try some place new a little ways off Mill.  I will be back for sure.  3.5 Stars is more accurate."}
{"text":"Food, coffee and staff were fantastic!  I had the sandwich special of the day and grilled three cheese and tomato soup, mexican mocha and a lovely table outside.  My lunch mate had a croissant stuffed sandwich with soup as well.  The deserts looked wonderful and will go back soon for that.  Only downside...parking...either bring change for parking meters or park in garage.  The garage cost us $4.00.  There is no validating.  I see this more as a landlord issue that the coffee shop."}
{"text":"OMG!  I just witnessed the owner of the café coughing and sneezing all over the muffins as she put them into the display case. I walked straight out.  that's the last time I get near that place."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for a while now, which I may add, I never write reviews, but this place asked for it. I heard about this place from a friend, who clearly had to have gotten her food to go because it is the only possible way to leave this place satisfied and not offended.  I came here to try it out with my boyfriend about 6 months ago and walked into what appeared to be a cute little cafe.  I saw a few tables and was told by a timid waitress that we could sit down and she would help us out from there.  I could tell it was an older couple who ran the place.  The male owner came over and took our order.  At first everything was good, my latte was alright, nothing special. We waited maybe 15 minutes for our sandwiches and salads.  I don't recall it \"taking forever\" but it must have been right before their lunch rush or something.  I was about half way through my meal and the male owner comes over to the table and tells us basically we need to be finished and out in 10 minutes because they have a group of 4 that needs to sit down.  We shockingly looked at each other thinking, \"Is this guy serious?\" He was dead serious and in fact came back maybe 5 minutes later to check up on our progress of getting out.  My boyfriend said something to him and he told us that we weren't allowed to \"just sit down anywhere\" anyways.  We were so upset with that treatment that we just left and  I just could not believe how we just payed 30 maybe 40$ for a couple sandwiches and a side salad and my over-rated latte.  My boyfriend was so disgusted by that treatment that he vowed never to return and still REFUSES to go back to this very day. I admit to going once more but got it to go.  This time I had no problems and I actually really like their lavender lemonade.  Like I said before, if you're in the area and decide to eat here, get it togo! The food isn't bad but I wouldn't go out of my way for it until they learn how to properly run a cafe."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast & lunch spots since I moved to Arizona. I can't say enough good things about this place. The owners are wonderful and the food even better. Everything is made from scratch down to the salad dressings. I recommend trying one of their famous cookies, they are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great food, coffee, deserts!  Also pet friendly on the patio!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful sandwich and cup of soup. Great service, very professional and fast. We even took a couple bakery items home for later.  I highly recommend this place. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Are YOU kidding me? This very morning I walked over to this \"hidden treasure\" as I had found it a few weeks ago.  I saw the fantastic baked goods and couldn't wait to share with my friends... I wouldn't spend a nickel here. Rude Rude Rude.  10:20 this morning I was treating myself to breakfast and the little girl behind the counter was sweet.  I spotted the menu and decided to use the table service the girl was bringing me a menu and a muffin; as I'm sitting the owners whipped husband comes to the table and tells me he needs the table for the lunch crowd.  I said and lunch is when?  He says well you have a computer and you may stay for hours and I need this table.. so I proceed to another and that was the wrong table too.  He wants me at a tiny table in the doorway in the sun.  I asked if he was kidding, I had been in the hospitality industry and he was not acting hospitable. The little girl is trying to hand me the plate with the muffin and I'm telling her it is okay please wrap it to go...I'm not wanted here.   The queen bitch sitting in the wing back chair with her strap on under her apron in case the husband acts up.. pipes up to tell me that I do not need to buy the muffin - I told her she was absolutely right and walked out."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Hidden jewel of Tempe and wonderful people!"}
{"text":"Good food. Service was OK. Parking was lame. It was very busy at lunch time. In my opinion, unless you work in this area and are already parked there, make this a once-in-a-while spot."}
{"text":"The Bean is The BOMB!!!!!!!!!! The food is incredible, the pastries, the lunch, everything.  Great variety and everybody there is so nice.  It can get busy at times, specially at lunch, but totally worth the wait and Christina and Taylor will always take care of you.  And the crack bagel is something you need to try at least once in your life.  And finally the owners, Robert and Lou Ann, are the best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great peppermint bark mocha. Good scrambled eggs and bacon breakfast. Nice to see a place that baked their croissants fresh"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. First restaurant I have ever been where the owner and employee had a huge argument in front of customers! I had to ask them to stop. Later I talked with security guard out front. Said that happens all the time. Not for me. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This was the worst. The person making my food did not understand the order. 3 women bickering over it and one even said \"OH MY FUCKING GOD\" to the young blonde girl putting the bag together AND YOU FORGOT MY COTTAGE CHEESE, so I said and she provided it,  this was my FIRST & LAST visiting this establishment,  customer service is what helps your business sustain and grow."}
{"text":"I've been going here since a little youngster and they have never disappointed me. Would recommend the stuffed croissants! Absolutely delicious! In fact, everything is good, you might as well order the entire menu."}
{"text":"Mom&Pop shop that I adore! Absolutely love this place. Great coffee, food and ambiance. Owners and staff are delightful. Perfect stop for breakfast or mid-day pick me up."}
{"text":"This Mom and Pop Cafe is reminiscent of Starbucks,  but with much friendlier personalized service,  and better quality food and pastries.  I haven't disliked anything yet."}
{"text":"Love at First Bite  I have been coming to this restaurant for over 3 years now and not once have I had an unpleasant experience.  Ever since the first day I walked in I've felt a warming feeling, almost as if i was in my very own home.  The owners and staff are amazing and will stop at nothing to make sure your experience has been a great one.  Everything on the menu is AMAZING, personally my favorite is the Chicken Breast Sandwich on multi-grain toast and you can't forget to add the avocado and bacon or else you're cheating yourself.  Once you're done with your meal do yourself a favor and have one of their unique and delicious cakes, or at least the butter cookie.  The time that you spend enjoying your desert will be the closest you'll ever come to feeling like you're in heaven, I PROMISE.  I've shared this place with all of my closest friends and they agree, Romancing the Bean is the best cafe in town!!"}
{"text":"Solid  lunch spot for fresh sandwiches and tasty soup. Can't go wrong with a turkey and avocado sandwich on multigrain and veggie chili. Also be sure to try something from the baked goods case. The chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies are exceptional.  It does get very busy during the lunch rush, but if you can eat early or late, you should have no problem. Also a great place to eat outside on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"My co-workers treated me to a really tasty lunch here last week and now I can't wait for our next visit.  The food is delicious!! I had the ham and swiss sandwich with a side Cesear salad - sounds basic but I loved it! We also ordered their grilled cheese as it was one of the specials that day and again, seems simple enough yet we were all impressed! The only drawback is the size of the place; it's rather small...however, if you're going for lunch and can get there by 11.30am, your odds of finding a seat are much better!"}
{"text":"A cafe that definitely caters to more of an ''adult/professional' crowd. They sell sandwiches and salads options, as well as offer a few dessert items.  I just came here for coffee and was pleasantly surprised by their options. My girlfriend ordered a White Coffee which was made with condensed milk. Definitely good for people who like creamy coffee drinks They're very flexible on how you want your drink ordered.  I got an iced caramel drink that was about $2.95. They put them in stryofoam cups which I thought was a bit weird especially for an iced drink.   The location is right off Rio Salado with metered parking or a garage. It's a bit hidden and not your typical ASU coffee shop where students are taking up all the spaces to study."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great croissants, soup, and dessert! They are known for their delicious chocolate chip cookies!"}
{"text":"I've stopped by Romancing the Bean a couple of times now for lunch & to get cookies and have thought their menu items were just okay. My orders have included the chicken sandwich and the chicken salad sandwich which are usually two of my favorite sandwiches at other places. Unfortunately, both the times, the chicken tasted really off so I decided to stay away from those.  I did also go in with a group once and got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup to give something else a try. While I didn't think this was the best menu option, it was better than the other sandwiches I've had. The best part was the sit-down service. Our waitress was really good about keeping everything organized, splitting checks, bringing out our food out quickly, etc.  The prices they charge seem typical/fair since the sandwiches come with a side salad or soup (or you can get just the sandwich at a lower cost). The first time I got a salad with the herb buttermilk dressing, which while good, was just really dry and the second time, I figured maybe I'd give their soup a try. I got the chicken tortilla but it wasn't served hot! I had to heat it up, which is fine but again, not something I'd ever crave.  I'm still giving this place three stars mostly for the cookies. The chocolate chip ones are always really delicious and on point. I'd pretty much just come back for those!"}
{"text":"AMAZING cookies and muffins!  I'm not big on sweets, yet I still go out of my way to buy them here  The hidden gem of the menu is the Hot Doggie.  A big all beef hot dog wrapped in a croissant.  It's only on the lunch menu, but if you order it in advance they've always let me get it for breakfast . . . AND . . . they'll even bacon wrap the dog!   Wha?  Yep  Everything I've had here has been rock solid or better.  Shame they're not open on weekends . . . would be perfect to chill there after biking at Tempe Town Lake"}
{"text":"Well, lets get to the main complaint about the Bean first - price. Yes, it is pricey. I work in the building and its pretty much the only option for a quick bite or drink without driving. So, to an extent it is to be expected.. no competition.  But i like the Bean because the food IS really good. I love the stuffed croissants, the muffins, cookies, etc. Everything is home made and you can tell. The chili is great - even the breakfast croissant.  Service wise i have never had a problem. They are almost always busy (again, pretty much THE place for people working in the building or living in the condos next door).   Free wifi is nice.  The comment about pre packaged food is ridiculous though."}
{"text":"I've been going to romancing the bean for a year now at least 2-3 a month. The reason for that is because they make everything from scratch. They make their salad dressings, whipping cream, breads, all of the pastries including the cheesecake, cookies, muffins, etc are made by the owners wife.  The service is average I haven't had any complaints. They also have blankets if you get cold during the fall and winter seasons. They also sell things like clocks or whipping cream maker and tea pots Caesar dressings which is limited,  etc. I park at the meter spot all the time and never put any quarters in and i never get a ticket so that's a plus. :)  Overall, It is a little pricey but it backs it up with great tasting food and great portions and a varieties of food to chose from.  The place is kind of hidden between corporate buildings so it may be hard to find but just look for the blue buildings. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The owners were very helpful and were engaging with the ALL of their customers. It appears like they love their job and it shows. You rarely see this these days. The food was amazing as well. I can't wait to find an excuse to be on that side of town again so I can enjoy their tasty food!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm really appalled to hear about the customer service issues people have been having here.  It's truly sad when a business owner feels the need to insult his/her customers. But, that didn't happen to me..  the coffee happened to me.  This place is called \"romancing the bean\" as if it's supposed to be a coffee shop.  But they should probably rebrand it as a lunch cafe for the suits that work in the building. Maybe renaming it.... \"For us, by us\"  or \"Tons of Pastries\"   Anyway... I went there one day with a friend.  She ordered an americano, and I a mocha.  We were promptly served, and sat down to watch the school aged girl (10 years old?)  work as I had a server on a school day.   What is that all about?!  It only took a glance into the cup to realize that we had crap handed to us.    My mocha was gritty and disgusting.  Probably from using low quality chocolate (maybe even chocolate powder! Yuck).    Her americano was looking bad, the espresso crema was almost non existant, and after a scorching sip, we both realized that they have no idea how to use their espresso machine.    We threw away our drinks, and headed to cartel.  To anyone interested in coffee, please drive a few minutes down the road to any other coffee shop in the area.  Cartel is south, Open Source is east, Sola is north, and even Starbucks is right around the corner on mill."}
{"text":"The food is OK but they take 20 minutes for stuff to be out.  I was sitting inside at a table ...waited 20 minutes for food and had to be on a business call. so i just come out, talked 5 mts come back and see that the drink  i had half drunk  has been wiped off.  i ask the Lady ( seems to be the owner) she almost shouts at me why I had left. I told that i was on a call so i had to walk outside..she angrily hands my food 30 minutes later. This is customer TORTURE.  NEVER EVER going BACK.  and the coffee here sucks...try some other store...even starbucks is better"}
{"text":"After reading some posts, I'm surprised to hear about the staff being rude. I work in the building and come here quite a bit. Staff has always been friendly and great, one time I called in an order and it wasn't ready when I had went down to pick it up. Well one of the girls forgot to put my order in, but she was honest and said that was her fault. I got 2 free cookies out of it :) They are a little pricy, but just about everything I've tried there is delicious! There was maybe a cup cake and muffin I didn't care for, but their croissants, brownies, cheese cake, soups, chef salad, croissant stuffed chicken with cheese and ham is to die for!!! If I could afford to eat here everyday I would! I've eaten a few times at the tables and was never given any problems or been told to rush out. I really do like this place."}
{"text":"I wish this place was open 24/7! Everyone is always so friendly and the food is so delicious. Their crescents are great as is their coffee - definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The Bean, is the ONLY spot located by my job, so your kind of held hostage. The food is $$$, so don't get that sticker shock look lol But the food so far, is good. The owner i believe, is the older lady. She is f'ing annoying and NOT nice."}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had! Staff is super friendly, place has a really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and lunch while staying at the AC Hotel next door. 5 stars for taste, 5 stars for value for price paid, 5 stars for friendliness of servers but 0 stars for how slow service was.   Came around 12:15 and it was peak lunch rush. To go line out the door, no inside tables available. Grabbed a table outside and it took 15 min to flag down someone for a menu and then someone to take my order. Server was incredibly friendly and apologetic and once my order was taken, food came out promptly and was delicious (turkey and swiss stuffed croissant with side salad). Didn't bother me too much since I wasn't in a rush.    Came the next day around 915am for breakfast and they weren't that busy but a lot of their staff members were on break and eating their own breakfasts so it took over 25 minutes to get my food and I eventually had to ask for it to go so I wouldn't be late to my meeting. Ate it while walking but it was still delicious.   Had a ton of time to observe and severs knew a lot of regulars by name and remembered which tables they liked to sit at and what they typically order, which was nice.   Would definitely recommend if you a) can figure out the best times to go, b) call way in advance to place a pick up order, or c) have at least 45 minutes to an hour to eat-in."}
{"text":"amazing gazpacho, best stuffed croissants, good coffee and attentive service. They really know whats up !"}
{"text":"I have one word for you: Macaroons. These guys make THE best, AND their customer service can't be beat. I called an hour before closing to secure a dozen for a friend and they didn't have enough. Not only did they make me fresh macaroons, they kept the door open until 5:15 for me to come grab them. You only get that kind of service from someone who cares about their guests and believes in their products, and this place does it the best.   The only downfall is the lack of parking at their location--but that's not their fault. It's a hidden gem, and definitely worth the find!"}
{"text":"The good: the peanut butter chocolate cookie is amazing. Crunchy and thick outer circle with a soft and almost underbaked center. Can't wait to try the muffins.   The bad: I came here to get lunch at 11:30AM and waited for my salad for honestly 20 min. 20 min!! I also requested no cheese and my salad was packed with cheese. Because I was running late for a meeting I didn't have time to ask them to remake it and had to slowly pick out all of the cheese. These two things were truly terrible and I hope they can improve this especially during the busy lunch hour.   Will not come back here for a salad but will definitely try the pastries."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING !!! The staff is the absolute best. I'm obsessed with their coconut macaroons made fresh everyday . They baked me one a couple of weeks ago when they sold out of them ... best place ever , great food , clean and super friendly !!!"}
{"text":"Great! Fast and friendly. Tasty coffee. Reasonable prices and awesome baked goods. I'll definitely be sure to make this a habit over the usual chain. Quiet ambience. I went around 9 am and there was a lien but it moved fast."}
{"text":"Romancing the Bean is in the office building I work at, so I come here often to grab a little pick me up or a snack. Everything I have ever ordered has been delicious!  The star of the show is really their croissants. They are so buttery and flakey and gooey and delicious. Ever since I came back from Europe, I've craved croissants, and this place really hits the mark with theirs. While the plain one is my favorite, their filled ones (available for lunch) like the Ham and Swiss are absolutely amazing as well.   They also have yummy muffins (lemon lavender and french toast, anyone?) coffee, and my guilty pleasure - Italian sodas! Everything is reasonably priced and the service is always fast. They usually have some fun music playing and the ambience is lively.   I really love how it is an independent coffee shop, so it feels good to support local. And trust me, they have earned it! Definitely stop in here for a treat or afternoon pick-me-up!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Romancing the Bean, and it was about what I'd anticipated. A coworker mentioned that she'd tried this place and loved it, so we decided to make the quick ride over to grab a bite!   I ran inside to get change for the meter while she parked, and while I waited in line, an older lady (who appeared to be a cook/chef) was yelling at the girl at the cash register about not telling people that they'd bring them food at the tables when they check out at the register. The poor girl was embarrassed, but quick about getting me my change. We sat down outside and were approached by a waitress who brought us our waters. Another girl came up to take our order, and the food arrived fairly promptly.  I had the turkey and cheese croissant with raspberry dipping sauce and a cup of the chicken tortilla soup. The soup was great! Next time, I may well just go for a bowl of that - very fresh and tasty! The croissant was great, but I longed for the taste of some fresh veggies (lettuce? tomato?) on my hot sandwich. I tried the dipping sauce which was REALLY sweet (a little goes a long way!) and quickly finished my lunch. It was pretty good... the croissants were hot and buttery, but still, I wished I'd had some veggies tucked in there! (More like a panini, I guess?)  When we finished, we'd planned to go inside and pick out a pastry to take back to the office. The waitress insisted we go in, look, order with her and then she'd pack them up for us... (which was fine, I've waited tables, and if she's going to serve us, she ought to be tipped for what we buy.) The problem was that when we got up to select a pastry, another customer took our table, meaning we had to stand and wait for our orders/checks outside, and again for our cards to be returned.   I picked out a blueberry scone that looked so good, I had to leave it in my car, or risk eating it as soon as I walked back in to my desk!  All in all, it was a quick, quality lunch, and I'm sure I'll find my way back there. With the scone, lunch and tip, I think it only came out to around $12-$13, so that's a good value. It's not in my top 10, but it's not bad! Very pretty location. Next time, we'll order to-go and go sit by the waterfront!"}
{"text":"Wow, I will never be coming back here again.  Ordered a crab salad sandwich and then proceeded to wait for 50 minutes.  When my table's food arrived, I had no sandwich. I was not about to wait another 50 minutes for my food so I left.   The table next to me was complaining that they had to wait 20+ minutes to see their server to get their checks to leave."}
{"text":"Romancing the bean is my favorite lunch spot in Tempe. Although, they are only open during the week they have great specials. My favorite are the sloppy joes on Thursday's. They also have a wide variety of soups, salads, teas and sandwiches. They are great for catering too!"}
{"text":"Probably not a destination you would visit unless you worked here or wanted to have a business meeting and thats the kind of people you run into here.  Beautiful business people.  I met a friend just to check out the baked goods and try the coffee.  It's really a full dining experience with a breakfast and lunch menu that look delicious.  I got to spy some of the lunch items heading out for catering and they looked fab!  Coffee and baked goods were good but I think I spent as much in parking fees as I did in coffee.  Staff is probably the only questionable factor here.  Manager was correcting them loudly in eating area which seemed very unprofessional.  Good workers are hard to find.  Thanks Romancing you do a great job!"}
{"text":"This place may look like a cafe but it doesn't only serve coffee - you can get full meals as well. I ordered their signature stuffed hot croissant (ham & cheese) and oh my, it was delicious! The croissant came with a side - soup or salad. I took the chicken and wild rice soup which was delish as well. I had come here without an appetite (feeling ill) so I was surprised that I polished the plate! We also ordered the macaroon: toasted shredded coconut with chocolate chips. I hate shredded coconut but surprisingly found it tasty. It was baked to perfection.  The service here is excellent.  It's my first time here, and was made to feel welcomed like a regular VIP! Especially Christina who radiated genuine warmth and cheerfulness to all her guests. She was proactive in making sure we had everything we needed, and this was during peak hours when she was also managing many other tables.  A charming place indeed. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"In town for business and decided to check this place out instead of the hotel breakfast. Liked that it seemed to be a locally owned coffee shop. It had cooked to order breakfast not just typical bakery items and bagels. My colleague and I both ordered specialty coffees and omelettes.  We had to ask many questions and repeat our order many times as the menu was not clear on details and the cashier seemed distracted. We ordered one with cheese and one with meat. A few minutes after being seated, what seemed to be the cook came over and asked if we wanted veggies, I happily said yes not knowing that was an option. As we were waiting a lot of drama behind the counter not sure if it was arguing or what but very loud and awkward. Overall convenient coffee shop for businesses and hotels walking distance. Omelette was a typical one I would make at home, tasty but nothing to rave about. It was awesome that cook came out and questioned our plain omelette but would have been nice to know the options up front. If I was in the area I would check it out again just based on location."}
{"text":"Okay so if you want your mind blown by amazing baked goods.... ahhhh the chocolate chip cookes... you have to try Romancing the Bean, plus pair it with a flavored ice tea and your basically in heaven. Really though, everything here is so good, too good. You will not regret trying this place out."}
{"text":"I came in on a whim after a meeting and decided to order the turkey croissant. I was expecting a normal cold sandwich, but it was a little crisp pocket of melted cheese and turkey, with a side of cranberry sauce. Much different and very good. The chicken pot pie soup was served nice and hot, with plenty of chunks of chicken and veggies. I wish it was closer to home"}
{"text":"I have gone to Romancing the Bean several times now for lunch. Not only is the food excellent but so is the service. The server is very good to let you know what the daily specials are and are very prompt in getting your order taken and delivered! I have had the Ham and Swiss Croissant and it's baked PERFECTLY! I love how the croissants are sealed all the way so it's like a little yummy pocket of heaven. I've tried the Cream of Asparagus soup and the Gazpacho and both were so flavorful.   I would HIGHLY reccomend stopping in here if you are in the area!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a huge variety of lunch items! Came in with co-workers and sat outside, not great ambiance as it is basically in a parking structure but it's better than sitting in an office!  The crepes look awesome. I got a turkey sandwich with avocado and a side salad. Took awhile for the food to come out, due to the large amount of customers. Unfortunately, there was a big black hair on my sandwich and I had to send it back. The 2nd one came out pretty fast, so I'm hoping they didn't just re-serve me the same one   The side salad was really good though. Overall, I wouldn't come back by myself, but  if my co-workers wanted to, i'd come back without complaining."}
{"text":"I am lowering the rating from 3 to 1 star. Because they really don't have any system for taking order. I ordered my coffee and they lost my order had to wait for 20 mins and then had to cancel my order. This is the second time this happened,  not coming here again. Being in a office complex they should understand most of us are on clock and cannot afford to wait 20 mins for a freaking coffee.."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, nice location, and terrific food! Not your typical \"coffee shop\", think Starbucks meets Paradise Bakery. This will be a new favorite Tempe lunch spot. I was here for a business meeting and they were extremely curteous and helpful without being intrusive. I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for breakfast and lunch in Hayden Ferry. The drinks, food, and service are always spot on. If you are in the area or building, definetly try this place out."}
{"text":"I recently started traveling to Tempe for work and my company happens to be in the building right next to Romancing the Bean, so heading over for breakfast, lunch and my in between snacks is a no-brainer.   I've sampled quite a bit of the menu, Sloppy Joes, \"crack bagels\", ham and cheese croissant sandwich, Hot Doggie, pastries and drinks.  Everything I've had has been delicious. And the service is always friendly and accommodating. Special shout out to the cashier with the short hair.    What prompted me to write a Yelp review was the exceptional service I received today. I came in with a kooky request for a side dish to bring to a company potluck, they not only made a fresh batch of potato salad for me, they delivered it to the office with a bow. I mean, really, a cute white bow.    5 stars for going above and beyond and the delicious food."}
{"text":"Latte was good, nice texture, lots of froth. Cashier was friendly, but I listened to what I believe to be the owner loudly gossip about people the entire time I drank my coffee. At one point she called someone a \"b*tch\" and after speaking to a potential future employee on the phone said, \"legally I'm not allowed to not hire someone if they have blue hair or tattoos, but I'm not hiring someone who has blue hair or tattoos\". The lack of professionalism was surprising and made my experience somewhat unpleasant. If I return, I'll be ordering to go."}
{"text":"Located across the street from Tempe Beach Park in some corporate business offices. Not the easiest place to find and be prepared to park by a metered spot or in a parking garage. I had just enough change to park in a metered spot and order my meal to go. Inside its very narrow and small café. The menu posting was hard to find while in line, but ended up getting the \"White Cheese Heaven\" (croissant with stuffed cheese). This meal is a small portion but very tasty nonetheless. Nothing special with the black tea but all in all have to come back for the breakfast menu and try out the coffee!"}
{"text":"I am really impressed with this tiny space tucked between office buildings. I am tired of the cardboard crap that Starbucks, Peets and the like serve  ,so I figured I'd try something new. They make a mean Americano - just what I need to survive an afternoon packed with meetings. Their pastries as HIGH quality and the ingredients are the real deal - cream filled puffs means you get WOW fresh cream not whipped cream or fake cream. I am a fan. Only problem - parking is a pain. I havent tried lunch here but judging by their pastry selections, I will be coming here soon!!"}
{"text":"The cookies are about the only good thing about this place.  The service is outrageously bad. A friend and I ordered lunch- just some sandwhiches, and it took over 30 mins. After telling the waitress that we needed to rush things with the check, she took even longer, forcing us to go to the front of the restaurant to pay.  The manager is always courteous and thoughtful, but his staff is always terrible. On the few other occasions I have eaten there, my order is always incorrect.   Huge waste of time, if you are looking for a speedy lunch."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero rating I would. I will NEVER be back there.  My friend and I went on a stroll with our newborns in strollers and stopped here for a drink since it was hot out. We bought 2 Italian sodas from a very nice barista. Then we decided we wanted to try food from the food truck located just outside. We were told by a very rude blonde lady, while we were still enjoying our drinks, that we would have to leave. She handled the situation very rudely and told the security guard of the building that we were not customers, which we clearly were. If that is the way they treat customers then I don't and would not want to be one EVER again."}
{"text":"If you're in Tempe come check this place out.  The coffee and sandwiches are delicious and reasonably priced.  A noteworthy item here is the superb customer service.  The baristas refer to customers by name when checking in on people sitting around the cafe (pretty cool when they only hear your name once when ordering).  A personal touch in an impersonal world.  I highly recommend this cafe to anyone in Mesa, Tempe, Chandler or Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Lavender Lemonade, Almond Roca White Chocolate Mocha, Ginger peach iced tea, Praline Latte, desserts and pastries that will make your heart melt, chocolate croissants, cheesecake, orange shortcake, cinnamon twists doused in a cream cheese glaze, muffins ranging from choc cream cheese to chocolate chip...this is the kind of coffee place that has all the fluff and eccentricities that I enjoy in a good cafe.  Not to mention, any sweet treat you get is rich and decadent.  I have never had a more perfect cookie than a \"Bean\" cookie.  Imagine Mrs. Fields and the Pilsburry Doughboy getting together and baking cookies at Paradise Bakery. Yeah, it still would not hold a \"cookie\" to the magic in these morsels.  Aside from the sweets, they also have a full croissant menu (picture an assortment of things rannging from turkey to cheese) as well as soups and sandwhiches.  Croissant menu?!!! I have died and gone to puff pastry heaven.    Why it doesn't get five stars?  I am not wowed by the espresso.  Even though I thoroughly enjoy the Almond Roca WC Mocha, I would love it more if Starbucks made it.  Is that bad?  Not as robust as I would like it.  Overall, it being the only one in the valley, I encourage headquarters to open one next to my house, and perhaps all over the east and west side.   Thank you, Bean.  Thank you for being here."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere in this place is amazing!  I like it that a family owned coffee shop is able to hold its own and be orignal.  I read a bunch of other reviews here on Yelp and can agree with most of them.  Parking sucks, location is fun, food is great, coffee is average.  Park by Montes for free and walk the 2 minutes over Rio Salado if you want to save a couple of bucks.  The food items taste as good as they look.  Muffins and egg dishes are a must have.  The owners are friendly, gotta warn you though, homeboy is a bit touchy feely."}
{"text":"Had lunch twice this week at Romancing the Bean...yeah it was that good!!!  The first time had the club on multigrain and a cup of corn poblano soup as a dine in...it was really good!!  The second time I had the chicken salad on multigrain with a bag doritos to go....it was very good!!  I definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here tons of times and have never had a bad customer service experience, so it's strange for me to be reading some of these reviews. Anyway, the food, coffee, and atmosphere here are all wonderful. Yes, prices for some of the lunch items is a bit steep, but I've never eaten anything bad from here. If you come for breakfast, the eggs and pastries are TO DIE for. The only downside for those visiting is parking. Since I work in the adjacent building, it's not really an issue for me and I will keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"One of the best and most charming gems of a coffee shop/cafe in town! It's hidden and many don't know of it... But at Hayden Ferry lakeside off Mill Ave and Rio Salado is this tucked-away spot! Business hours, so make sure you stop in before 3pm. I think they close around 4-5. It's awesome though! Try the Italian Sub, chicken salad, egg salad, all of their desserts (seriously!), and they've got great salads and soups! I love the Italian wedding, chicken noodle, and my all-time fav --- tomato basil ravioli! Mouth-watering. They get swarmed during lunch, so try to make it early or go after the rush! :)   If you can manage to get a cookie or macaroon when they're baked fresh, you will surely be hooked!"}
{"text":"Stellar! Fabulous! Life-Savor!  Seriously does NOT get any better than this. Always friendly and accommodating, the food is yummy and tastes like it came out of mom's kitchen, prices are reasonable, but where they shine is in providing catered lunches, snacks, breakfast and more to local offices. Outstanding presentation, set-up and clean-up. I always try a new soup and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Incredible all around. All the foods from pastries to soup, salad, and sandwiches are delicious. Coffee is excellent. I would recommend trying their chicken noodle soup, best I've ever had. Great owner and staff. If you're free Monday-Friday for lunch I recommend definitely stopping by here."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite between classes.. Usually not a fan of coffee shops but my boyfriend told me that he knows this place that's light & healthy. It's not only a coffee shop/bakery, but a indoor&outdoor lunch restaurant. I was amazed, such a awesome spot for quick bites. Not the cheapest, but SO worth it. The service is impeccable, the food comes fast, & you can ask to sample some things like soup of the day or like me, the chicken salad sandwich. Definitely going back for more! It's like heaven in my mouth!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Romancing the Bean. It's hard to not go here everyday. Food is delish and the baked goods are amazing! Owners and staff are super friendly, but I don't think I would even care if they weren't. :) YUM."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. I always come here for lunch when I don't bring my own. They have soups, salads and sandwiches as well as a large variety of sweets. Many people come here for the muffins. I love the lemon bars and banana brownies when they have them.   They serve breakfast and lunch, but I've never had more than a \"Crack bagel\" for bfast which features bacon and cream cheese on an everything bagel -  it was Insane."}
{"text":"The most friendly staff you will ever come across. Everything is always so polite and nice. Food is great too!"}
{"text":"Dear Bean to whom I am romancing, I really do love you and I want to fully commit to you but... you left me out in the cold on the patio and you know that if we are going to have a relationship, you will need more space to accommodate me!  Sure you can make a mean taco salad, chicken salad, lavender lemonade, and grilled cheese, but sooner or later, your beauty will fade and I will need something of substance to hold us together.  Something more than your evil pastries and breads.  Something deeper than the red velvet cake cream that I secretly devoured during a stressful lunch break.  I know that I should have written you this love letter a while ago but don't hold it against me.  You allowed others to be the first to romance you and I felt some kind of way about it, I admit.  But, you know that I would cross all kinds of swerving traffic and find you between whichever building you decided to snuggle between.  Just consider making a wee bit more room for me or being open for longer.  If you care about me, you would do it.    Admittedly, your beans are good and you look cute in all those trimmings early in the morning.  I should not be so demanding but I know you to be able to deliver so, I insist.  I do like your peeps you allow to hang out with you. They always seem so nice.  They even remember me and my likes.  I really enjoyed that you cater to my every need too and deliver all on a silver platter.  Why am I with-holding the star? I want more types of beans and tea and I have yet to see you work out a Lemon Ice Box cake.  Once that happens....I will get you that golden gem you are waiting for.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Turning in to my go to place for lunch. The chop salads and soup never disappoint. Always fresh and their dressings are great! Love their tea too and I rarely would notice how good the tea is at a restaurant. Service is always top notch. Very attentive. A tad pricy. Not horrible.   Seating is thin inside. Not great. Outdoor seating is nice but beware of seats under areas where a bird can perch. Eek, yes I saw it happen. Eww.   Gets a bit crowded if you go in the middle of lunch but hey, crowded is a good sign!"}
{"text":"So, I sorta have a love-hate relationship with this place. It is in my office building so I come here quite frequently. Their coffee (while not as strong) as Sbux is really good. I get their soups atleast once a week. Caesar salads are totally delish. Egg salad is awesome because they dont put a bunch of weird crap in it (pickles ewwww). My ultimate favorite are their Italian Soda's. I love them. Seriously, so good. Have a Strawberry one with cream. Okay, now I have two constant - never changing complaints about this joint. The prices are slightly steep, not ridiculous, but it is enough that people comment about it. Number 2, which really is my bigger complaint of the two, the girls they hire are quiet possibly dumbest bottom of the barrel, couldn't find anything better, worthless ASU students. I get it, it's a coffee house, not rocket science, but they are always standing around like they don't have a clue, and it seems like each of them can only be tasked with doing one thing at a time, or it is just too much. Like one can make this, the other can get croissants (which oooooo are so good) The owners (who work in there daily) are super nice. They just really need to find some better help."}
{"text":"Romancing the Bean: Too cute . . . Name and the place alike!  If I worked in this area, I'd be in BIG trouble.   Dine in service or To-go available here; obviously this is about a To-go experience.   Was in an all-day class in the Microsoft Office suite, and came down here on one of the breaks for some coffee.   Ended up walking out with their Daily Roast aka one strong cup o' Joe, plus one of the most amazing blueberry scones I've ever tasted!   Just the right amount of sweet, browned perfectly on the outside but still a soft on the inside. Nothing like those Crisco Bomb \"scones\" plaguing Starbucks pastry cases nationwide.   Did I mention this was all for $3.88?   Taylor was the cashier and she provided friendly and speedy service during the morning rush.   If you work over here, it'd be a mistake to not check out Romancing the Bean for some coffee, breakfast or lunch.   Know I'll be back when visiting clients in this part of Tempe!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding this place (caters mainly to the lunchtime business crowd in a business park) but once I did I was in heaven. The coffee was outstanding, as was the sandwich and salad (I had the grilled cheese). I also appreciated the free wifi. The only downsides were the slightly confusing setup (you sit down and wait to be served, OR stand in line to get something to go, but there is no sign that explains this), and the cookie I had which was too salty and just not all that. I also wish they were open on weekends..."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been excellent. They do an especially good job with catering. Excellent sandwiches, croissants, pasta and fruit salads. If you're anywhere near ASU, this is the place to grab a breakfast croissant or lunch."}
{"text":"i just found my tempe happy place! everybody here is happy -- the patrons to eat, the staff to serve, the back room to cook.  so much care and love went into RTB's caesar salad - literally the best I've ever had - and it was just my 'side salad' for...  Their  AMAZING cordon bleu croissant.  This is a TRUE croissant - flaky, layered, buttery, yet light - with chicken, swiss and ham baked inside.  As good as it gets...    I can't wait to go back again. And again. And again!  Thank you to owners Luanne and Robert for making a visitor feel like a friend.  And it was not just me -- these folks (and their waitstaff, too) know what it is to host!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there recently and the food was fine. I had a basic sandwich and the Caesar salad. But I will probably not return because they charged my debit card twice. That is a screw up I just can't tolerate."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for a while as I work nearby and love the food but the staff is what makes the 3 stars.   Food- Their pastries are excellent my favorite is the ALMOND BRAN MUFFIN yummy. Flavored coffee also great.  Location- Nice location, quaint and cute, they have a rack of funny cards which always crack me up. Owners- a couple that are always there working hard and very nice. Staff- Mainly girls that are more interested about gossiping about each other than the service. I've been coming here for about 2 years (because of the amazing food and proximity to my office) and on numerous occasion have sat there waiting for minutes as the ignore me and chat about their weekend. Another annoying thing about their service is that if you order a coffee the person ringing you up will actually go make your coffee holding up the rest of the line. Sometimes this makes no sense to me as there are other people in the back standing around doing nothing. I've comment to them before that they should have a better strategy for this.   I recommend going because all the muffins and cookies and to die for but make sure you do it when you have time to sit around and wait."}
{"text":"RtB is located at the bottom of my office building (Silicon Valley Bank) so I go there quite often. I've ordered iced teas and sandwiches and never been disappointed. They use Boars Head meats and quality breads so the sammys are my go to. My favorite is the club: turkey, bacon and avocado and all extremely fresh.   SVB uses them often for catering and the chocolate chip cookies are to die for.   I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this location but it is conveniently located and great for grab and go."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time a few years ago when I had a client in the building there. They were definitely client meetings that I looked forward to each month because I got to indulge in the delicious food downstairs. I happened to be in the area today, and made sure to swing in for a late lunch. Yummmmm. My absolute fave menu items there are their hot croissant sandwiches, specifically the chicken cordon bleu or the white cheese heaven. Delicious flaky croissants, melty cheese galore. But as I am trying to eat a tad bit healthier, I sadly resisted my first choice and instead went for the chef salad. I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint. The portions were huge, tons of meat, delicious Italian vinaigrette dressing. Annnnd...the roll that they included was just as flaky and yummy as their croissants, so I at least had my carb craving fulfilled. Would highly recommend this place for a great breakfast or lunch spot."}
{"text":"Good breakfasts and lunches. My husband and I were staying in a near by hotel and ended up eating there everyday during our 5 day stay. Good food, great coffee, and friendly staff . The prices were great too for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Been here for three different occasions and every time was good! The cookies were to die for, and the sandwiches are loaded!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to my work, and I have been wanting to try it out. Finally, I walked over there yesterday for a cuppa coffee and a cookie. Wow! If I could give six stars I would. Now this is the first time I've been there, and I haven't tried their other stuff, but if my experience yesterday was any example, I'll be back real soon.  Regarding the staff, extremely friendly. Not at all with that coffee shop attitude that you sometimes get. Very welcoming. Nice decor, very comfortable.  I ordered a Cappuccino.   The reason I ordered a cappuccino is because often when you order one you really just get a latte. A cappuccino has mostly foam, some milk and the rest espresso. I wanted to see if they knew how to make one, plus, I get a good idea of how good the coffee is. I was not disappointed. My cappuccino was the right temperature and the coffee was excellent.  I also ordered a double chunk peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. Oh my goodness. Big, thick, peanut buttery, lightly crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Wow. They have some other cookies that look just as good. Also croissants and some other baked goods. I think they make sandwiches too. Anyway great job. Love the place. I'll be back.  Update:    I've been back a few times. Not disappointed. Took the wife for lunch and we both had a stuffed croissant---delicious. A real croissant.  Buttery, flaky, delicious. Great Caesar salad."}
{"text":"The food here was really delicious! I did not really have high hopes walking in due to some of the bad reviews, but the service was great and the food was amazing!! We got the ham and swiss and the pizza style stuffed croissant with a side salad. We came around 3:30 so there wasn't much of a wait and the food came out quickly. Make sure to try the desserts as well. I brought my boyfriend back a cookie and he said it was one of the best cookies he's ever had."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Robert and Luanne are great.  Robert particularly makes me feel like family.  All the food here is so good it is hard to choose what to get.  A hot stuffed Croissant, with Ham and Swiss?  Chopped Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette?  A Sloppy Joe or French Dip when they are on special?  One of the awesome soups?  Too many decisions."}
{"text":"When I worked in the building I absolutely loved this place. Everything tastes homemade, fresh and full of flavor. The wait staff is also great and super friendly! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times now. I only stop for coffee and a snack, but they have real food too. The people are nice and the coffee and baked items are good, but the counter service is slow."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice little cafe for lunch. Its tucked away so you won't see it from the street. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star is unfortunately the service extremely lacked. Not a great first experience. Hopefully next time it will be better...yes there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  The owner himself delivered our catered request.  The presentation was wonderful and the food was so delicious!!  I will definitely be using them for future meetings.  I highly recommend.  Thank you Romancing The Bean for a seamless and delicious experience :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch, great prices, nice people, and possibly the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.   Things get busy, but they still manage to get stuff out to us pretty quickly. We always get it to go, so I haven't had to deal with any rudeness.  I liked their soups and their croissants are great. Overall, a good place to eat."}
{"text":"The food is good with the reasonable price. I usually take for togo. However, today when I had lunch in the cafe. Definitely a HORRIBLE experience for me....very unprofessional waiters. I tried to get someone's attention for just menu and water and that took me about 10 mins. At least 4 waiters walked by. I called them, and no one listened. I believe my sound should be loud enough cause even the customers far away from my table heard that. One of the waitress, I'm pretty sure she saw me and she just turned around intentionally.... It was like I'm invisible to them. I can understand waiters are lived on tips, so if I'm not sitting in his/her area, they don't have responsibilities to answer me. BUT how can I know who is the waiter for my table? Very disappointed, and will never go again."}
{"text":"Love love love!  Great coffee even better--pastries.   The sad part I live in California.  Very friendly staff.  A must visit if you  are in Tempe.  High light of my trip."}
{"text":"I spend way too much money here.. 3 words: Asiago Crack Bagel. It hits all the major nutritious food groups with bread, cheese, and bacon. The coffee is superb. The staff is friendly. The eggs are fluffy, and now so am I. Thx Romancing the Bean!"}
{"text":"Romancing the Bean was recommended by a friend who works in the area and since I had to drop my mom off at the airport, I thought it would be a perfect spot to take her before her flight and I couldn't have been more pleased!  I was lucky to get a metered spot right out front and a table inside as another couple stood up. We both ordered the turkey and swiss croissants with raspberry dipping sauce- DELICIOUS!  The croissants were flaky and the sauce was the perfect complement to the meal. My mom rarely finishes a meal and proclaimed she wasn't very hungry as we walked in...I've never seen her finish her food so quickly!  She has already decided she is going back next time she's in town and I plan on returning several times before that happens."}
{"text":"My husband works in the office building the Bean is located in, so we happen to frequent quite often.  Sometimes lunch, sometimes just a snack after work, and on rare occasion we grab breakfast there.  Their muffins are absoultely wonderful; especially the cinnamon chocolate crunch.  The croissant menu is fabulous, and the grilled cheese is delish.  My very favorite part of the Bean?  Ginger Peach Iced Tea.  Oh yes!  It is to die for. Tends to be pricey, but I'm hooked on the $2.50 iced tea, so what can you do."}
{"text":"I came to Tempe from LA on a work trip, and was told the food out here isn't amazing compared to LA. This place is super cute! Red walls and tall gothic chandeliers. The cashier was patient with me while I was figuring out my order, and he listed all of the options with me, step by step.  I got a low carb breakfast wrap with spinach, onions, mushrooms, and avocado and a medium cold brew. And the total came out to $11. In LA this meal would've hit $20, so the price point is great.   When I actually got the wrap, the avocado was minimal, the onions and mushrooms were raw, and they forgot the spinach altogether. I'm pretty sure the tortilla was not low carb. The cashier also told me my wrap came with tomato soup when it didn't. They didn't even have tomato soup that day! I ended up wanting soup anyway so I got what they recommended, which was a potato cheddar soup. The cheese looked and tasted very processed and it wasn't great.  Overall it's cheap but they'll get your order wrong and it's Arizona, so maybe keep a low bar here."}
{"text":"This is a must find location you would never know it was here unless someone points it out.  Food is fresh and delicious.  The owner is hands on making sure everything is up to his standard and the servers are fin and efficient."}
{"text":"Stopping by for coffee or tea is nice, but having breakfast or lunch is a real treat! Super friendly service, a healthy and delicious menu, and a dessert case full of fresh goodies will bring us back to this hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"Never had the chance to write about how good the food is here.. Great vibe, friendly service, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Never, ever, ever again. Ever.   Because even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that.   And just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit.   So, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.  PS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by."}
{"text":"Romancing the Bean is located on the ground floor of Hayden Ferry Lakeside buildings next to Edgewater Condominiums and some other urban high-rise overpriced condominium tower whose name can't recall along with two other (and one on the way) office buildings that surround this massive mixed-use campus. Hayden Ferry Lakeside is located on the NEC of Rio Salado and Mill Ave... on th eNorth end of Mill. My major complaint with this sandwich/coffee/pastry joint is the price.  Yes, the food is good. The breads are amazing, their cookies are crisp and chewy, and their croissants are really yummy. They have a wonderful selection of mini cupcakes and wonderful tarts. And all their food is made to order - it's fresh and crisp; and they also have this great poppy seed dressing that is flavorful and bold.  But their prices are expensive. A chef salad is $11, a sandwich is about $8, a large drink $2.50, a croissant is $3. It's just pricey. And the last 2 times I was there I got overcharged and had to bring it to the girls attention. (+ they use Styrofoam which is a no no for me)  Parking is easy, the joint is friendly to wheelchairs, and they have patio seating (I recommend you walk around the back of the building and eat right on the edge of Tempe Town Lake)...  Their iced tea is good, their coffees suck, and they have Italian flavored sodas (vis a vis Torani syrup) but again, they are pricey.  Also remember that within 4 minutes walking distance you have all of mill avenue tempting you too...Rula Bula, RA, Cafe Boa and a slew of other restaurants that have lunch specials comparable in $$ to Romancing the Bean."}
{"text":"10.2.16 Team was running late for lunch so un order to grab a quick sit down bite, we walked next door to this amazing spot.  There was inside seating but it was 70 degrees in Tempe and us San Diegans took advantage like it was home weather.  A frequent comer to this spot, a co-worker mentioned a wednesday only item called the taco salad.  Kind of skeptical and nothing else on the menu intrigued me so I went for it.  The service was good and the outside seating was refreshing.  This 5 stars is for the food itself and the atmosphere was a plus.  I guess looking at the plate it doesn't look special, but as you mix all the ingredients together and then scoop up a chipful of that salad, it was really good.  i couldnt get enough.  I honeslty could eat this every day u til I get tired of it.....once I like something, its rare I get tired of it.  Making sure I come here on Wednesdays if I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious homemade food! Their soups are exceptional love their BLT & chicken cordon blue"}
{"text":"NOTE: This is on the bottom floor of the Hayden Ferry Lakeside building.  I was looking for a coffee shop close to Tempe Center for the Arts for an evening event, and wasn't willing to go through the pains of finding parking off Mill Ave. Parking in front of RTB is, sadly, $1.50/hr (payable only in nickels, dimes, and quarters), but the inexpensive prices at RTB make this well worth it! A small coffee is $1.39, they have cold-brewed toddy, and they did a good job with my iced dirty chai (only $4.42 for two shots and a grande size...about $1 cheaper than Starbucks and just as good).  I didn't have any of their food items, but there is a LOT of variety for such a small shop. Lots of savory options, sweeter options, pastries, desserts, smoothies...you name it. The staff are such a delight--they seem to all be good friends, and were enjoyable to sit around while I worked.  Free Wi-Fi of quite good speed. Owners were very kind and checked in a few times to make sure I was doing okay.  Great outdoor seating--13 tables ranging from 2-person to 8-person tables. Inside there is seating for about 20 people, including comfy chairs.  I'll be coming back, for sure! It's a great study/working atmosphere. Quiet, unobtrusive music (which is hard to find close to ASU's campus), good atmosphere, easy to get to."}
{"text":"This place has phenomenal food and the atmosphere is great. The service I received today was OUTSTANDING!!! They take it a step above and make it feel personal too. I will become a regular!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed every lunch I've had here (or taken to go) and the service is also excellent. The entire staff always wears a smile even though they are usually super busy. The claim to fame for Romancing the Bean is their baked goods. Their muffins and croissants will blow your mind!! They also usually have a few scones, cakes, and cookies. I also love their lattes and they even offer soy milk.  Breakfast pastries aside, I am usually in here for lunch. All of their stuffed croissants are incredible!! I have to force myself not to order those (because of the calories). Another favorite of mine is their special on Fridays which is creamy tomato basil soup served with a perfectly grilled cheese sandwich. Watch out, though, they'll add jalapenos in there unless you ask them not too. They are just quirky like that."}
{"text":"This joint is so easy to review.  The chef owner is the best baker/creator in town...hands down.  With her insane selection of tasty muffins, cookies, and pastries...you can't go wrong here. I don't even know how she does it!  Aside from her amazing culinary delights, her husband runs the front of the house and is one of the most involved and friendly business owners you will run into. They are truly passionate about their gift of running a successful restaurant.   Sure this is mainly a restaurant that caters to the workers in this little business complex and they are probably missing out on being one of the best places in the city because of their \"hidden in a office building\" factor....but....YOU MUST AT LEAST COME HERE TO TRY HER INSANE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE if nothing else (that is if I haven't already taken the last one.)"}
{"text":"This place has got a pretty good vibe when you walk in! And the coffee and food does not disappoint. I came in here for a black coffee with sugar &  warm bagel with jelly. It is in a very upscale part of Tempe, and I quickly made assumptions about what they had to offer but they completely turned my assumptions around. The customer service was very good! Nice, friendly and a welcoming atmosphere. The individual who helped me was chipper & nice. I ordered my items and they were quick on delivery. Everything was made to order and I enjoyed my small breakfast meal. They have lots to offer such as small breakfast food items, various teas and juices and coffees. I suggest coming here during the week if you're in the vicinity, its a nice change & the views by Tempe Town Lake are amazing to walk around and see as you enjoy your goodies!"}
