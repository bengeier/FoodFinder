{"text":"This is the most disgusting pizza i have ever tried to eat had one slice took a bite and the pizza was still dough ive been working in the food industry for almost 10 years and i have never been more grossed out when i tryed to call and speak to someone that works at this establishment the man on the phone yelled at me and refused to send another pizza or even give me my money back now thanks to this my son is going with out and i have to figure out what my aon is eating at almost 7pm at night currently my husband has been trying to talk and the man refuses to give us the manager number so we can contact him directly i highly highly recomend never going to this establishment or ordering for delivery and i can rest assured ill never be ordering from them again dont make the mistake i did and order from them"}
{"text":"What a horrific place, the owner is an embarrassment to his industry, I wouldn't ever order from here again or even recommend to anyone in my life. The food is better from the frozen section at Walmart. Absolute shit show of a business my only hope is the recession takes this business and the owner loses everything he has."}
{"text":"I will admit, I no longer purchase pizza from major chains anymore.  I have had it with being stiffed on toppings, cheese and service from zombie-like high teenagers with glazed over eyes who have the same personality as a frying pan.  I troll mom and pop shops and have learned that they often are your best bets.  Pizza Time is one of those shops.  I have to admit that yes, the location is considered to be in the ghetto, which I have absolutely no problem with as I was raised there but have since moved up in the world, but when it comes to pizza, Sid has it done right.    This guy is like a real life Super Mario, super friendly and makes every pizza like he's making it for his family.  Never skimps on the toppings and the dough is by far the best I have had in the city.  If you ever are on \"International Ave\" make a stop at Pizza Time, Sid will take care of ya."}
