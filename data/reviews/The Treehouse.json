{"text":"We drove all the way from Bronxville NY to see the Cavaliers play and stumbled upon this place while searching for a place to eat. At first, we thought it wasn't a place for kids, but the staff  could not have been more gracious. We had the chicken confit, gnocchi, walleye, bucatini and Brussel Sprouts plus some broccoli I w/ mozzarella. It was so eclectic that we  almost ran out because we didn't think the kids would like it . Instead we had a top 3 dining experience . This is coming from a family that regularly dines at some of the best restaurants in Manhattan..... Mostly in the east and west village. The dessert was awesome as well. My wife loved the fact that the whole kitchen yelled out that our kids had nut allergies and that there should be no cross contamination. As a mother she could not have been more satisfied( our oldest son went into anaphylactic shock on two separate occasions). Our waitress rocked and dessert was awesome too!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the hummus plate to start (Tuesdays the hummus is $5), and I must say it was pretty good. I'm very picky about hummus and I found myself scrapping the bowl. For dinner, I ordered the black bean burger and it definitely hit the spot. Can't say the same for the tarot tots- they taste exactly like the frozen-from-the-bag kind I had as a kid. Nothing special. 
Lastly, our service was some of the worst service I've ever had. Our server couldn't had a worse personality. It seemed as if we were bothering her and she didn't want to be there. It's a shame that she brought down my first experience there."}
{"text":"Fun bar with a great patio and look. The beer and drink selection is big enough to meet almost everyone's needs. It can gets busy with plenty of nice people to look and talk to . 

The service is either excellent or horrible, depending on the hangover level of the bartenders. The food menu is limited and the execution of the food has been uneatable since fall of 2014.  
I have been going here for years, before tremont became hip, and I hope they turn around the kitchen and some of the staff."}
{"text":"Treehouse is one my regular spots to go with friends. Their beer list is great, and their best feauture has to be there huge patio space. The only bad thing about it is sometimes it's so crowded you can't find a seat!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner around 6:30 on a Sunday. Very chill vibe - 20-somethings drinking beers and watching the Indians, a slightly older crowd at the bar. Like many places in Cleveland, it's cool but not pretentious, and the staff is welcoming and genuinely interested in getting to know you.

We were really impressed with how quickly our food came out, and for 20 dollars (for the two of us combined), our MONSTER salad and pulled pork sandwich did not disappoint. Would like to come back sometime when we could really appreciate the menu (we were just blowing through Tremont and needed something quick and easy) and just hang out. The people that told me Treehouse was a spot in Cleveland worth checking out were not wrong!"}
{"text":"Beware of brunch.  The service was extremely slow, with no apologies for how long the food took to come out.  Server actually appeared annoyed at us for asking when our food would be ready.  The french toast, bacon hashbrowns and an omelete took over 30 minutes to come out.  Food was sub par, and the bacon was cold - and not cheap!

The Treehouse may be a great place to go for drinks, but we will never go back for brunch."}
{"text":"The bar is beautiful! Whoever crafted the bar, tables and chairs did a fantastic job. Great drink selection, especially beer. Their martinis are good, too. The lemon drop in particular is delicious!"}
{"text":"I rated Treehouse about a year and a half ago, after being a customer for over a decade. They have stepped up their game a hundred times over since then! The service and attitudes of the bartenders and servers has done a complete 180. On Halloween night when business was slammed, every person working was smiling, prompt, accurate, and genuinely made everyone feel welcome. The burgers are still the worst, and the tater tots are still the best, but the most important thing, the service, is definitely back to the standard I once set for this bar."}
{"text":"The treehouse is one of my favorite restaurant and bars. They have amazing food that is not expensive and the drinks were very good too.  The service was amazing as well!  This place is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to get some beers in Tremont.  The decor is nice and yes they have a tree.  When I was there the art work was from 1-4th graders and they were selling it.   Parking in Tremont can be a little hard."}
{"text":"Best place in Tremont! Great food, atmosphere, and patio! I love the local artwork on the walls and listening to live music on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Found out that they just started selling food items a few months ago.  We decided to order some takeout from them, so I can't really review the inside although the decor was pretty cool.  I got the tree-monster burger which was loaded with bacon and even an egg.  Once again another burger better than Mr. Symon.  If you have read my other posts I have a strong dislike for Mike and his B-Spot strip mall failures.  
I will go back and am excited to try some of the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Why is it every time that I go to the Treehouse, the servers take forever to come to our table or don't acknowledge us at all?  I ended up leaving after waiting 15 minutes at the patio with no service, and it wasn't even busy! Clearly, they don't need my $."}
{"text":"Love coming to this bar! I like the beer selection and I enjoy the food. I frequently come to this bar after softball games in the evenings. They have a great patio to sit on during nice weather! 

I also like coming to this bar to grab drinks. It's casual but nice."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars, I would select. Upon closing time, was forcefully pushed through narrow gap in fence to exit bar. Initially after trying to obtain an alcoholic beverage. I was brutally forced out of the bar by an employee who claimed he \"did not lift\" when clearly lifting is something he does often. Name of bar was clearly misleading as upon entrance it was obvious to me the tree was not real; observed roots, none were to be found (no leaves either). I am not religious but the only option I had was to sit on church stoops directly across from the bar. Even the people who walk by this place are dicks. Would not recommend this bar to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Douchiest bar in tremont. Guys are closet case ball cap backwards wearing chach. Jersey girls. Nice guiness pour but that stopped being hard to find 15 years ago. Most uncomfortable bar stools this side of concrete."}
{"text":"Amazing salads and good beer. Fun, happy atmosphere and great patio."}
{"text":"A bar with a nice patio and relaxing atmosphere. They serve solid food and booze, at a reasonable price, which makes this a potential spot to frequent if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Went to The Treehouse on a Friday night for happy hour and was shocked that it was not busy at all!  Our table of 3 ordered fried pickles for a happy hour special - they were good, but I thought a little pricey for what they were.  The dipping sauce that came with them was good too!

On to the entrees - I ordered the special burger; which was a Korean burger - it was good.  My husband ordered the \"kitchen sink\" burger, which he said was good, and our daughter ordered the California veggie burger, which was good.  French fries with all of them were also good.  (Sense a theme?!?)

Everything was good...just average, but in this area, with so many burger places, good is not good enough.

Atmosphere was nice.  Not crowded at all, especially for a Friday night at happy hour in the summer on a patio.  Our waitress was super friendly, although not super attentive."}
{"text":"Great bar.  Been here a few times.  Love the layout of this place.  Main bar area in the front, group seating in the back, and patio behind the building.  So no matter the group you're with, you will find somewhere appropriate to settle down and have some drinks."}
{"text":"I was at Treehouse late Saturday night, after 1am. It was late and I was getting tired. I just wanted one more beer, something cheap. I don't need to drink $6 craft beers every single time. But hey, I don't need to justify myself to you. Apparently I did to the bartender though. I asked him to get me something cheap and he literally laughed at me. Well I don't think it's funny. Like laughing at me that I'm such a poor schmuck that I can't afford another craft beer. Maybe I can, maybe I can't. That doesn't matter.  I don't go to bars to be judged.  I don't derive my self-worth from how expensive the beers I drink are. 
And I especially don't appreciate being laughed at by a bar tender for my drink choice. So unprofessional. The owners of Treehouse should be ashamed of themselves for hiring staff of this caliber, or complete lack thereof. I am beyond livid. I've never been treated with such blatant disrespect from a person in the service industry."}
{"text":"ok.  i may or may not have said i would never set foot inside the treehouse.  but...if i did, then i need to take back those words today.

it wasn't that crowded because it was still early.  and no, it may not be my scene, judging by the few people who were there.  but i was there to meet up with some old friends and their family, and i had to write a review for this fact alone, which may or may not have been previous mentioned.

decor.

i don't know if you know the history of tremont, but it's kind of interesting.  or that could be because i'm a bit of a history nerd.  regardless, this section of cleveland has a lot of streets named after collegiate things.  \"professor\", \"college\", \"university\", and \"literary\" are in existence because the old cleveland university used to exist long before all the trendy restaurants were here.  ok, long history lesson aside, the university went away and became the old bible factory (that has since shut down) off of w.7th.  

all of this is explained BECAUSE...

aside of there being a freaking tree in the bar, the chairs to the tables are old classroom chairs.  the type of chairs you used to see in classrooms if you're old like me.

yes.  i said it. 
old.like.me.

so go to the treehouse when it's not packed with the jocks that will hit on you because they're wasted and looking for a romp around the university block.  because then you can actually appreciate the cool decor.  and a beer.  since they had a good amount of on draft stuff."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, once for food and twice for drinks, and everytime, I have had a great time. The service is great, the food is great (typical bar food) and the drinks are always flowing - extra props for the very cool, lighted tree in the center of the bar. The only downside is the stairs down the bathroom, which were super treacherous for me after a few drinks (haha). Great spot in Treemont for a night out or just to grab a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"This is a great go to place for my friends and I when we want to day drink on a Saturday. I really like the atmosphere and the type of crowd that usually takes over this bar. The bartenders are always very friendly and they have all kinds of great drinks up their sleeves. In the winter time they always seem to have hot apple cider just waiting to be combined with Rum and topped with whipped cream! I have never had the food here but if you like mimosas- do yourself a favor and order 1 or 3 or more. They really fill the glass up with champagne and top it with a splash of juice (oj, pineapple or grapefruit)!"}
{"text":"The Treehouse is perfection! Except they don't serve French fries, my biggest vice after Dr. Pepper. 

It has one of my favorite patios in town. Actually, it has probably my favorite patio in town. It gets cozy in the winter too."}
{"text":"Sub-par food. Bad service. Saw a waitress give the table the wrong check. INEXCUSABLE. What you expect from a dive bar."}
{"text":"Looking to have 18 red faced overly gregarious early twenties men in football jerseys and look-a-like polo shirts sweat beer on you as they try to pick  you up? Here's your bar! I've never had any experience in this bar that has made me want to return. Save your dollars and go over to Edison's- have a decent beer and tip the staff like crazy."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try it. Food ok. Drink selection ok. Prices just ok. I guess overall I wasn't too impressed. 

Sat on the patio on a Saturday night. Our table was gross. Assuming that no one ever cleans them because they are that grated patio furniture. People still spill on them. They still need to be wiped down. 

It was pretty crowded. We are then left. Uneventful. I'd consider giving them another chance."}
{"text":"As a former Tremont dweller this was one of my favorite places. I have never had their food but it was always the first place to hit on the pub crawl. The decor is just like the name says-Treehouse with a story size parrot on the back patio. The patio is huge! Great for large groups in the warmer weather season. I say season because it can be 80 degrees in March in Ohio and 15 the next day. 

They have decent draft beers including Guinness. The service is always good and the bar fits the neighborhood. Try it out the next time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Cool little place, nice beer selection (I like ciders)."}
{"text":"Very average, somewhat overrated bar.  Loud.  Crowded.  Overpriced.

There are a few saving graces, though.  Namely the Pineapple Martini.  Fruit is so much better when it's been soaking in alcohol all day.  Nice patio, too."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite bars in Tremont and I am almost sad I do not live near otherwise I'd be broke. 

We spent Saturday late afternoon in here and I was a bit disappointed with how empty it was. It was 4 of us and another couple and 2 hours in, just as empty.

Despite that, this place is cozy and that' what I love. Comfortable seating, love the fireplace, dark wood and the downstairs. 

What makes me happy about this place is the amazing Guinness pour! Worth going for that reason alone!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon, they were really slow. The staff was nice. The food was good, typical bar food. Nice selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"I just came back from a happy hour dinner at the Treehouse, and I was so pleasantly surprised that I could not resist writing a review! I know it's been around for a while, but for whatever reason it never really caught my attention enough to stop in. I'm really feeling like I'm way behind on the times now, because it's such a cool place!

First off, they have a great drink selection, which is extremely important. They also offer mixed beers, which I don't see nearly often enough. Offer me a beer, and I'm excited. Offer me two different beers in one glass, and I'm unreasonably excited! The menu features a nice mix of standard bar foods- pizzas, burgers, etc. They offer two different veggie burger options- garden and black bean- which was a nice touch. I opted for the black bean burger, which I throughly enjoyed. 

With a nice mix of food and drinks at reasonable prices, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have the lesser known but equally tasty, Taco Wednesdays.  I stopped here for happy hour before a nearby event and was pleasantly surprised.  I haven't been here in over 8 years and this place was way better than the after football league memories from way back when.  I liked their long draft beer list with happy hour pricing.  And the tacos were 2 for $5 with great flavor.  I got the delicious Veggie: roasted Brussels sprouts with a spicy aioli, tasty Flank Steak:  with onions and peppers and a southwest sauce, and tried the BBQ Pulled Pork: warning a sweet sauce but the pork is great.  I will not wait another 8 years to return."}
{"text":"I started going here a few years ago for my Sunday night beers ;)    The patio is awesome for hanging with friends in the summer.  There is also a nice old fireplace in the back room with a couple of tables around it.  Staff is friendly though short-handed at times, they have a good beer selection and now serve food.  If you like mixed drinks, try the stoli-doli, not much to it but there is a nice surprise when you get to the pineapple (makes half the drink lol)."}
{"text":"I've been hanging out here since '90s and really enjoy this place.  Not a great neighbourhood, but thank God a lot of off duty cops are here.  Back in 2000 they even tagged a couple would be robber-thugs here."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Sunday. At the time the bar wasn't very crowded but it had a neat feel. There were only a few other their for dinner. They don't have a very large menu, but they do have a nice variation of food and everything is very reasonable. When it comes to the food I thought it was good but not great.

I would definitely come back and recommend others to do the same. Overall it is fun unique bar that has pretty decent value."}
{"text":"2.5-3 | Came here for a great friend's post-baptism lunch! I had a great time with her and the many others who came to celebrate. We were in the back patio on a very sunny, beautiful day. We totally enjoyed the weather and the company.  The patio was so great for the day, and the interior was very welcoming. I really like the tree theme and the giant guinness mural.

Sunday lunch seemed to be much more tame than what others have said about the crowd at Treehouse. No obnoxious football fans there! 

The menu is very punny and I laughed out loud for some of them. I ordered a veggie sandwich and it was just ok. I think most of the barfood was very standard. I'd definitely come here for the patio and for the company of friends!"}
{"text":"What a fun place!  Great bar with a good menu and an interesting crowd.  We all enjoyed our food -- burgers, wraps and pizza -- and the atmosphere was a lot of fun.  The only downside were the stools at the high-top tables in the bar area which were very uncomfortable.  Next time we will sit at the bar or at one of the low tables in the back.  But we were certainly return!"}
{"text":"This place would be decent if it weren't for the terrible service. The bartender could not have been more rude and unpleasant."}
{"text":"Usually really enjoy food and service at treehouse. Tonight a few minutes after sitting down an 8 top abruptly abandoned their table. Fifteen minutes later not a single server had so much as greeted us. 

We walked out too."}
{"text":"This is one of the best all-around bar / biergartens in Cleveland.  Nestled in the historic Tremont district, and keeping a number of other bars, restaurants, and businesses company, the Treehouse is the place to go.

Lots of decent beer on tap, a full bar, and special vodka-infused pineapple drinks, if that's your kind of thing.  Also a great place to have a get-together with friends."}
{"text":"Dopey, Ball-Cap-Guy Central...

THE UP-SIDE:
Your average, everyday bar.  Booze, beer, etc.  Nice looking decor for a corner-joint.  Service is average.  The outside patio (in Summer) is a good place to hang.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This place is consistently too noisy with music and deafening conversation levels.  In addition, it's nearly-always a \"sausage-fest;\" with big, dopey \"guy's guys\" outnumbering the women two to one.  Every once in a while, the management here attempt to resurrect an \"authentic\" Irish feel by having an Irish guy with a guitar play some songs and sing in a faux-Irish accent.  I find these times to be a truly phony and horrid little experience.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Stop in for a beer or two but don't expect anything great."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink in a cool setting. The beer selection was pretty good - not too extensive - and the staff was really friendly. The inside is cool with the tree in the bar, the fireplace and the natural wood tables and chairs. The patio is also nice with a built in TV screen to watch games."}
{"text":"Being my first time out in Tremont, and my first time at Treehouse, I had higher expectations.  Maybe I'm just a victim of over-hyping but from what people say,  you'd think this place was the go-to place for Tremont.  Either way, everything was just average.  Average crowd, average drinks, average scene.  Nothing stood out or was memorable.  It just seems like your plain, basic neighborhood bar, nothing to write home about.  It might have just been an off night but I don't think I'll be visiting this place again.  it just doesn't seem like there's much going on here."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends! Tons of beers on tap and cozy vibe. Patio is awesome in summer, but fireplace inside and tree behind the bar make the inside a great spot too! One of my favorite tremont spots!"}
{"text":"3 stars because they have a really nice and very large patio.

Otherwise, it's just kinda blah. Very overcrowded and really loud. Good for the bar, not good for me. 

I think every person (besides fellow Yelpians) all looked exactly the same - and minus the group of ladies who wore old bridesmaids dresses from weddings past. Very cool idea, girls! I'm stealing it for the next Yelp meetup. 

Their sangria isn't so bad. Probably better than the Ed Hardy brand.

But yeah, the patio is really their saving grace. And maybe that tree thing inside."}
{"text":"Really, the best patio around. I usually go on Thursday nights and  no one else but us is there. I'm not sure why because with the summer weather where is everyone?

The food is good, not your average bar food, which is nice. Great veterinarian options (hummus, veggie burger) and good pizzas too. The staff is always really friendly and I've never had a bad time when I've gone there. 

PS Definitely go there is you would like to adopt a cat. There is always at least one stray on the patio that are so friendly you want to take them home and make them yours."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I came here on a Saturday night and had a lot of fun! I ordered several of their \"Absolute Mess\" cocktails because they were wicked delicious and relatively inexpensive. We also ordered their loaded tots and poutine. I was impressed with the poutine, which is saying something since I lived in Maine for a while and have definitely eaten a lot of poutine in my day! Even the next morning when I finished up my leftover starch, cheese, and gravy, they were still super delicious! 
Our waitress was also very attentive even though they were quite busy."}
{"text":"The Treehouse fulfills my belief that beer is best enjoyed in the local neighborhood dive bar and not in some fancy club. First off, it is called the treehouse because the middle bar is has a fake tree in it which is beyond cool. I feel like the tree is metaphor for the experience in which the bar is grounded in the roots of the local area yet willing to \"branch\" out to visitors from all over. Plenty of bar seating and also tables around this place can accommodate small to large groups comfortably. The service was amazing. Being from out of town, the bartender sat with is for about 20 minutes and provides recommendations. Their draft beer selection is great. There is also some cool stain glass around the bar as well to add to the ambience. I will say my absolute favorite part was the guy sitting next to us brought into the bar his set of harmonicas and quietly played along with the songs he knew. It just really reflected the neighborhood feel in the place. Could not recommended this place high enough if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and as expected, it was crowded.  There were people everywhere but it wasn't too hard to get a drink. What I like about this place is that it's a chill atmosphere and you can come here anytime and still manage to have a good time with  your friends. The first thing that caught my eye when I came here for the first time is their giant tree in the middle of the bar. It's definitely eye catching and what's pretty cool at night is they'll light it up. So it's kinda of Christmas-y. The drink prices aren't that bad either. They got a full bar and plenty of good quality beer. 

Their sit down tables resembles their theme of being a \"Treehouse\" so the table tops and stools are made out of actual tree trunks which I find awesome because that just shows that they're all about being green, hence saving our planet. They do have a patio out in the back as well so that's even more useful, especially during warmer months."}
{"text":"love the treehouse, and not just because there is actually a tree in there.  it is, hands down, the best place i've been to in cleveland for mixed drinks and booze.  seriously.  order a rum and coke and you will get a glass of rum with some coke for color.

the decor is definitely more upscale than some of the original tremont spots like edison's, but it's not pretentious and goes with the artistic character of the neighborhood.  the patio out the back is fantastic in warmer weather.

it can get a little crowded, but i tend to think that's because this is a great place to go.  tip well on your first round and the bartenders will remember you.

suffice it to say, i've never had a bad night here, except for that one time my friend's car got hit by a drunk driver . . . and i spent 5 minutes telling my friend \"naw.  that's not your shit.  what are the odds?  get another drink,\" despite him saying \"that's where i parked.  that sounds like my alarm,\" and sure enough. . . .  btw, 5 stars to the good samaritan who followed said driver and came back to give the license plate number to the cops; to the cleveland p.d. who tracked said license plate to the owner's house; to the owner who gave up the i.d. of her friend who had borrowed said van; and to me who identified the driver, by her boobies, no less . . . as she drove past the patio at the treehouse.  no stars to the dumb byotch who answered her front door to the police, bleeding from the forehead where she hit the steering wheel, and immediately said \"my brother was driving.\""}
{"text":"I have complaints about this place other than I remember coming here years ago for dinner and not being blown out of the water. However on this visit it was perfect! We came here for a few drinks after dinner at another location but stayed long enough to eat again! 

The staff here-LORD ARE THEY AMAZING. They genuinely seemed to be having a good time and were all smiles and excited to serve us. I am not used to that. The prices were reasonable and I love that they had HH specials on their drinks that always helps. I tried ordering the blackberry jalapeno margarita but they were out of some items so I just got a original margarita and the ingredients were mixed perfectly. Everyone else drinks were made well too. 

The vibe here was great and it seemed very diverse of people popping in and out as well as people dining in for food only. The tree in the middle with the lights just creates a perfect setting on a chill night. We were able to grab one of the tree stump tables and I could easily have hung out at Treehouse all night. 

We ended up ordering a burger and tator tot (which was $10-great value!) the portions were generous and they cooked the burger to order which never happens!! Delicious bar snack and would totally order it for dinner as well some day. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The flatbread pizza is terrific and fresh,  each week they have a different flavor of hummus and it is great. They have GREAT sangria, and would highly suggest they consider selling this by the pitcher versus the glass.  The patio is relaxing and they have great local bands that play during the week."}

{"text":"This is a really cool place to go to for drinks the bar is so unique in our server was awesome"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Tremont. The large tree and Cleveland skyline photos inside really make a Clevelander feel at home. If your going on a Friday night though you may want to get there early as all the bar seats were packed. There is a nice fireplace towards the back of the bar. Beer was a pit pricey, I had the Cleveland IPA for $5. They're known for their Strawberry ale, which we were going to get until we found out it sells for $9 a piece. Waitress was nice and expressed a good knowledge of the menu. I would highly recommend this as the best bar experience in Tremont."}
{"text":"Fave. Cleveland. Bar. This is why The Land is back on the map. You will not find anything like this anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great patio! This place is so cute. The atmosphere inside is cozy and fun with a huge tree in the center of the bar and stained glass. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. We had a pretty big group on the patio and our waitress was very patient and friendly. The food is a higher price than most bars but it matches the quality and is very good. The cocktails are great."}
{"text":"We found our way to The Treehouse when exploring the Tremont area. It can be described as old cozy Irish pub meet giant papier-mâché esque tree, and I LOVE IT. The tree trunk is positioned in the center of a three sided bar and the branches span across the ceiling. There are a number of high top tables along the walls and a back room with additional seating. The Treehouse has all the Irish classics and big local beer draft selection. While the beer and space is great, the staff takes it up a notch. They were conversational and even wrote us out a list of other bars to check out in the area. Their hospitality is one of the things that will make my first trip to Cleveland so memorable."}
{"text":"They have a new chef and the menu has a nice variety of options. Weekend brunch is always delicious and fresh. The bartenders are very friendly. They have some new patio furniture, padded couches and chairs, that make the place feel very homey.  Treehouse !!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Good bar food good service good beer, you really can't ask for more. We can always find a seat either at the bar at a table or in the back at one of the booths. The patio looks nice I'm excited for the weather to warm up again to get out there. I subtract one star just because of one particular experience where a guest was drunk and out of hand interacting with us while we were trying to eat our meals. This place is great though, super affordable, really good, check it out."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend while I was visiting Cleveland. The atmosphere was unique, and resembled .... well.. a tree! We sat out on the patio which was nice. The food and drink was pretty standard, but I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I love the concept that Treehouse built a restaurant around a tree that's in the center of their bar. How fun is that! They have numerous great beers on draft to choose from. They have, quite possibly, the best tator tots smothered in cheddar cheese, bacon and green onions. I could eat them on a daily basis if they weren't so bad for me. Their loaded chicken nachos are also really good. I like when my nachos don't get too soggy and they did a great job of keeping the chips crunchy while still giving you a generous helping of toppings."}
{"text":"Ehh, the food is pretty good but this place seems to be resting on its laurels.  I think they need to realize that the Cleveland food scene is more competitive now.  Their food is fine for bar food, but their customer service is pretty lackluster.  I also got a $9 drink in a plastic cup last time I was there (what?!).  I don't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"WARNING: Unless you like an über crowed bar filled with a bunch of drunks who just got done playing football, avoid Saturday afternoons at Treehouse. Other than that, come all! 

I actually really dig The Treehouse, just not on Saturday afternoons. There is nothing appealing to me about packing a bar with hundreds of very inebriated, sweaty people. I don't have anything against those who are in weekend sports leagues. In fact, more power to ya! I'm too lazy! But you're just asking for obnoxious behavior when you get an entire league together in one bar... especially one that has been drinking all day. 

The patio is totally money during the summer. Huge, tons of tables and pretty chill during the week. Plus free Wi-Fi!!! I may have used it for a happy hour/work zone on more than one occasion. What can I say... I'm always productive. 

On random weeknights it's fun to stop by and hang out inside too. It's usually relatively quiet and you can easily enjoy a pint or two. I like that they have Hoegaarden on tap too. It just tastes so much better that way. Typically the bartenders are nice and talkative as well. I mean, if you're talking about something other than the huge tree in the middle of the bar. :-D"}
{"text":"My wife and I needed to waist some time, so we stopped in here for a drink.  I think it is just a drinking bar.  My wife and I both had Magic hat drafts.  I love that beer!  They had a good mix of beer on tap.  This place is such a interesting little place.  There is a Tim Burton looking tree sculpture that looms over the bar.  In the back they have a sweet original fire place.  The patio was not set up, but I bet in the summer it rocks.

I can't give this place five stars because I don't know how the operate during their prime time.  

COOL Little bar!"}
{"text":"I got two strong, well made gin and tonics here for $6 each, pleased with that. I liked the wood theme, thought that was cool. The bartender, some bearded fella, was pretty snarky/rude to my buddies and myself. My one buddy had type II diabetes and the guy wouldnt say whether or not certain beers were cider based, etc. Just over all being a dick with a bad attitude and acting like everything was a big hassle.  Im willing to give this place another shot but if a theme starts to develop here will definitely take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple of beers on a Monday night. They have all day happy hour on Monday's, which is $1.50 off drafts. The staff was supper nice and brought us waters right as we sat down and took our drink orders.  Their draft selection is good as well.  I love the tree that they have coming out of the bar.  The food menu looked, and had several different vegetarian options.  We will be back for food one day soon."}
{"text":"We are new to the Cleveland area, here from Asheville, NC. Being from Asheville, we are used to great restaurants, great pubs, great food and drink, and world-class hospitality. We have become fond of the Tremont area, and Lincoln Park in particular. We visited Treehouse once prior, and although the service was so-so, the food and beer was satisfying. 

Enter Christmas Eve 2016.

There were a number of places open in the area on Christmas Eve, so we thought we would venture out for a few beers, as is tradition for us on Christmas Eve. We decided on Treehouse on a whim, frankly because it was the first place we encountered. Bad idea. 

We sat down at one of the tables, and sat for about five minutes with no service and no comment from the staff. The brunette female that was working even visited the table next to us, having a laugh with her \"friends\", and returned to the bar without a word. My brother already wanted to leave, but I decided to visit the bar. I spoke with the woman who ignored us, and before I even said anything she said, \"We don't have table service tonight; I was only over there because I know them.\" So, she was obviously conscious of the fact that she blatantly ignored us. Anyone with any understanding of hospitality would've notified us that there is not table service due to a shortness of staff, and at least provided menus, and advised us to visit the bar to place orders. Although you were short staffed, as she mentioned, she had the time to chat with her friends at the adjacent table. I asked for menus and a beer list, and she handed them to me. 

When I arrived back at my table, I realized that she didn't give me a beer list. So, I again visited the bar, and asked Mark for a beer list. Mark, very dismissively, pointed up at the chalkboard to the scribbled list of brands of beer on tap. This was not a beer list. This did not describe the beers so I could place an order. I then asked the woman for a beer list, and she handed me one. I made sure to show this to Mark, so he understood what your beer list looks like for the sake of future customer requests. 

At this point, I was angry, and this was the last straw for us and Treehouse. To have this kind of experience after only visiting for the second time, and on Christmas Eve, was reason enough to never visit again. As an added bonus to us and all the other guests, Mark gave us the bird as we walked down the sidewalk past the bar. 

Thankfully, The Spotted Owl was not far away, and they were completely gracious, thankful, and welcoming to new customers on Christmas Eve. Not to mention, we discovered that they make some of the very best cocktails in Cleveland or anywhere. Thanks Zach at The Spotted Owl!

{"text":"Spent a couple nights in Cleveland with my fiancé and this bar made us feel like locals. Very friendly and personable bar tenders. Live music was nice but nothing special. Bar food here is definitely elevated. Im very picky about my wings and the treehouse does it right. Very crispy even while being covered in a delicious sauce. Extra points for homemade blue cheese dressing. Would definitely come back if we have the chance!"}
{"text":"$5 happy hour pork sliders weren't too shabby. Was $1.50 PBR night on Tues as well. Had a glass of red wine too for $5"}
{"text":"No beer menu posted, so you just gotta check out the taps. Ok selection. Didnt try the food, because the menu seemed pretty basic."}
{"text":"I live on the East Side, so when we hang out with our West Side Friends we try to meet up somewhere in between... In this case between was Tremont, at the very cool Treehouse bar. 

The place itself is really nice.  Has an artsy / Indie feeling, and a great selection of beer with cool art and stuff on the walls.  We went specifically because on Monday night they advertise all day Happy Hour and $5 burgers.  The drinks are all $1 off which isnt terrible i suppose, but nothing to write home about.

My only complaint was that the $5 only applies to I think two offerings, the one we got (Tremonster)  was still billed as $9 and that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth since we werent warned when i asked about the specials.   

The pretzel appetizer we got was excellent though, plenty of salt and cooked perfectly with mustard to match.  The burger was great, though not worth $9.   All in all a nice place, especially on a quiet rainy Monday night."}
{"text":"I don't understand the poor reviews.  I really don't understand the douche who has never even been there but only gave it one star, get serious.  Let put it this way, a lot of thought has been put into every aspect of the entire place, taking one step inside would confirm that.  The place is the tits.  Whoever designed the inside and patio did an excellent job and knows how to get things done metallurgically speaking.  The back room is cool too.  Definitely not some sudo-fancy, wanna-be chic dump that looks like an Ikea catalog aborted itself on the walls and furniture, just a lowdown good place to get drunk, often.  Definitely felt at home, right away.  

The jukebox here deserves 5 stars, hands down.  They have a great beer selection, including a Cider on tap, if you like Snakebits you know how rare that is.  The staff was really, really friendly and nice.  We where there on a Sunday and I guess Tremont only has Beer and Wine on that day, no big deal.  We had quite a few drinks and the bill was very, very cheap.  One of the nicest bars I have ever been in and definitely the nicest in Cleveland for sure.

There would have to be some serious, serious Douchbags that drink there to stop this from being my regular spot if I lived in Cleveland.  Their tequila selection seemed a bit slim that is my only beef.  Otherwise cheers to anyone that has \"Rocky Raccoon\" on the jukebox.

Save my stool, I'm coming back.

{"text":"There is a huge tree in the middle of this bar.  A TREE.  Is this the MGM Grand, the Rainforest, or a Bar in Cleveland?  Loved the decor.  You have to go just once to see the tree."}
{"text":"The good: The Treemonster burger was delicious, and the Tator tots were solid. The meal would have given this review a 4 or 5. 

The bad: the service. We walked in on a Saturday night, not a single person at a table in the bar, and sat down at one of them. 10 minutes later, no menu, and the back room server just stood by the bar with her face in her hands. Awesome. Anyway, my gf goes up and requests menus. 5 min later still no one asking for our order. I go up and order the food. It comes out fine, but then I still need to ask for the check. Mind you, 2 other girls walked in and sat at a table and some kid came and got their drinks and orders. It was a little ridiculous to be sitting in a semi empty bar, waiting for a menu. 

The bartenders were very nice, and seemed friendly, but I came to eat, not sit around and hope someone will come serve me."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their taco tuesdays.  Four tacos for four bucks.  There's only one kind of taco and if you only want one taco you're out of luck.  But there's something about them that I really like.  I dunno.  I like tacos.  Other than that there's really nothing else that really stands out.  The seats are super uncomfortable, I always end up meeting people I'd rather not meet but the bar tenders are usually pretty good.  
It's close to my house which is nice.  I like nature so the tree is a nice touch too.
The patio is spacious and cozy during the summer."}
{"text":"Attractive and clean bar and the burgers were good. I thought the bartender was rude and I have worked in the restaurant business for most of my life, so I definitely don't need anyone to chat me up or go \"out of their way\" for me.
I think she thought she was being cool and tried one attempt to make my boyfriend feel cheap for ordering well vodka. The drinks were made promptly and the burgers were served quickly with condiments. No silverware to cut the burger and the salt shaker was completely empty.
The server then asked us if we minded closing out our tab because she was going to be leaving. Normally I would have not minded at all if she was even remotely polite. We did cash out and left her a 15% tip because that is just how we are and just decided that if we ever see her behind the bar again we will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"3.5 bc the service was pretty poor :(

Super cute/cozy place and pretty yummy food as well!
I came in here with some gfs for dinner on a thursday night and it was a fairly light crowd-so you would assume the service would be good. It wasn't. We sat and sat and sat before an uninterested server came to \"greet\" us.

Anywho, the food was pretty good- meat lovers pizza, pretzel crusted mahi sandwich and a salad. I'll def come back bc the atmosphere was great and so were the drinks."}
{"text":"The treehouse has a nice casual ambiance perfect for hanging out with friends. I came to have lunch with a friend and sat by the window by the bar. The natural light was great and I really enjoyed the style of seating.

For lunch I had a spicy Italian pizza, which was good but not excellent. For 10 dollars, it was a pretty large pizza, I couldn't even finish it all.

Overall, I'd recommend treehouse to come eat and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Lovely day for a Guinness?

The Treehouse is located in the heart of Tremont along the popular strip of Professor Ave. From the inside, a creepy looking faux tree appears to be growing from the center of the bar. The building itself is made completely of brick. The exterior side that looms over the patio has a giant, can't be missed Guinness mural with the trade marked slogan and toucan. The patio is huge and plenty inviting on a nice day. Well placed landscaping provides privacy from the rest of the riff-raff sure to be lurking outside the patio gates.  

While I've never eaten here, the bar service could use improving on and it's one of the more popular destinations in Tremont which tends to result in large crowds, yet I am still drawn here again and again. The spacious patio and central Tremont location make for a perfect locale to meetup with groups of friends."}
{"text":"We went to the Treehouse for dinner on a Sunday night. The food was good quality and the beer selection was extensive. Nothing super fancy but made with fresh ingredients and tasted good for a very reasonable price. Despite a small menu there is something on it for everyone (burgers, flatbreads, tacos) and the night my husband and I were there we also saw several families with younger kids. We weren't in a rush so we had no problem with the service (our waitress was working her tail off but had a ton of tables and was the only server for the whole front area of the restaurant which speaks to poor management- I can see how this would lead to the frustration in some of the other reviews)."}
{"text":"A nice bar area with decent food, and a regular crowd. I've been here a couple of times and the crowd is a little rowdy and good natured. I had the bbq burger with tator tots and it was tasty.  Live music on Sundays at 6."}
{"text":"The Treehouse is my favorite unexpected brunch place in Tremont. After journeying to three different brunch places on a Sunday, each with a 45 minute wait, we stumbled in here on happy accident and were seated immediately. Also, props to the great server Nicole, who didn't judge us for wearing sweatpants.

When I think of Treehouse, I normally think of ambient cocktails on a summer night. Now I think of them as brunch. While the menu is small, it's about quality, not quantity. The corned beef hash was flavorful perfection, and for the first time ever, I had a house-made Bloody Mary that I actually liked! A little strong, but with a good spicy kick. Parking was easy, and there's a small lot across the street. This is a new staple!"}
{"text":"One the first bars I used to come to in the 90s.  Now there are better options..kinda.  They used to label this as an Irish bar.  A bunch of middle aged dudes chugging bud lt is not what I had in mind I guess.  The others are mostly preppy 'burb types just getting their feet wet into what the whole Tremont thing is.  Once and a while they have good singers come through on weeknights.  Its always been over priced for draft beer and on events (st. paddys, taste of Tremont..etc).  they gouge the hell out of people which is shady and wrong.  The Boys From Co. Hell do play taste of Tremont so Its fun then.  On Saturdays they host local football teams...late 20 and early 30 somethings who still think they are in college come here to get hammered and act like children. ...again, as Irish as it gets.."}
{"text":"I went to the Treehouse on a first date, & then again a month later (with the same guy!) to watch game three of the Eastern Conference Finals. It had a totally different vibe each time: the first, it was quiet & relatively uncrowded; the second, it was packed & loud & full of happy Clevelanders. Both times were good enough to keep me coming back, & I have since put it atop my list of Casual Places To Go Out In Tremont. 

The service is pretty good here, & the servers really hustle. Even when it takes them a bit to get to you, it's hard to be too mad at them because it's clear that they're busting their butts to get everyone taken care of. The food is standard bar fare - soft pretzels! loaded tots! - but it'll keep you full & in need of Tums. They serve pretty decent beer, but you can also get PBR in a can, so there's something for everybody - standard Cleveland. 

I dig the atmosphere in here - lots of wood, lots of light, but it somehow feels very cozy. There's a large seating area in the back that seems to be more restaurant than bar on slow nights, giving you a few options in terms of vibe. Basically, it feels like a dive bar that's not dirty or embarrassing. A good neighborhood spot.

I like the Treehouse a lot. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"I'm not particularly offended, but I'm definitely not impressed. I'd say a solid 2.5 stars. 

The setting is kind of a mix of quaint meets nice meets tacky. I really don't want to be rude, but the artwork on the walls they had was just really unappealing. I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but it really clashed with the rest of the decor. Everything seemed to have a layer of filth over it, our booth and table were sticky and there was crud all within the cracks of the wood. Even our menus were covered with spilled sauce. Turned me off a lot to the place. 

The food was mediocre. Nothing to complain about, nothing to write home about. We got the grilled chicken tenders which were okay, the Tremonster (which I stole a bite of - it was okay), and I had the Cobb salad. The salad was pretty good, the guac was delicious and the black pepper dressing was equally good. 

The have a decent sized beer list, but none of them are anything special, or anything I would go out of my way to have outside of being there. 

Our server was friendly and polite. He (or the kitchen) did get my order wrong but he was very quick in correcting it! 

I'll definitely never go out of my way to come back. I won't put up a fight if I were invited here as part of a group outing, but I'd suggest another place before accepting the invite."}
{"text":"Treehouse is a nice little Tremont staple. It has the old school bar meets trendy atmosphere and because the bar is split into smaller rooms it has a cozy ambiance. Oh - and there is a giant tree that sprouts from the middle of the bar, so that's cool. 

The draft list is always decent and listed on a chalkboard to the right of the bar. Prices are pretty much on point to similar bars in the area. I usually come here for drinks more so than food but I would like to try out their brunch.

I like Treehouse and I come here pretty much whenever I'm in the area. It's definitely on the less pretentious side of what Tremont has to offer. The bartenders are always super friendly and I never feel like they skip over me when I'm trying to order which I wish I could say for most bars. The outdoor patio is pretty nice and spacious but the last time I sat out there some of the seats on the chairs were rusting away into the danger zone."}
{"text":"Three stars for decor alone. I have to love it because there's a huge tree in the middle, a fireplace, a drunken leprechaun painting and big windows. I did not like the 'who gives a shit about you' 'tude from the barstaff. Luckily, we sat next to a gallery owner who gave us the lowdown on what to drink and some little history of the place. Drinks are way too expensive, they must still be paying off the interior designer. Oh, and just one of the many Tremont bars with a leg lamp in the window."}
{"text":"Be aware: the titular tree is sadly not a real organism flowering over the bar and providing sap, moss, or eucalyptus for consumption. However, it is a fanciful object--valuable solely for its aesthetic value. The food which one consumes beneath it is standard bar fare with a few notable standouts (the formidable quesadilla, the spicy guac+jalapeno topped garden burger). There is a gargantuan patio out back for summer luxuriating. Overall, any pub crawl through Tremont wouldn't be complete without a stop in at this leafy haunt, ersatz branching notwithstanding."}
{"text":"Been here twice: once for the beers, once for the food.

During the summer, they open up their back lawn area; deco is beautiful. A kiss of cool night air and a sip of cold beer (with a group of friends, of course) is enough to give this place the three stars it deserves. Strings of lights, seemingly like fireflies, hang off the hedge that surrounds the plot to provide a touch of wonder.

During the winter, this area is closed; or rather, nobody in their right mind would be outside. Inside, a little on the cold side; not cozy. Perhaps with a beer or two, the place might warm up. Dinner had a good taste, but no wow factor; I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich. Tasted exactly as it sounded: it was a buffalo chicken sandwich. Not sure how to describe it beyond that.

Inside deco was decent (nothing compared to the outside, however). There's a giant center tree, with lights strung up over it: hence, the Treehouse. However, nothing caught the eye. Summer, for me, can't get here soon enough."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent the afternoon trekking around all of the Tremont establishments and this was definitely our favorite spot. The atmosphere is super cool, especially for a guy like me that loves trees. Both beers we ordered are now some of our favorites. The bathrooms were super clean. This place has a lot of character. We would definitely love to come back and try the food sometime."}
{"text":"I live in Columbus, Ohio. I found myself in Tremont when I noticed a bar called The Treehouse. I was amazed. Had the well known Andyman's Treehouse from Columbus now come to Cleveland? The answer is \"No\" when sober, but while intoxicated as I was, it was a resounding \"YES\"! 

I walked in hoping to see the wonderful ambiance of couches, lamps, the piano, a nice tube TV above the bar so that we can watch whatever random movie is currently on AMC. Well, apparently not. The Treehouse in Tremont is much more trendy. (Say that one ten times fast. Also, say it while emphasizing \"tree.\" The Treehouse in Treemont is much more treendy. Get it? It's treemendously difficult). 

The Treehouse is located in Tremont, which is a nice little area of bars and shops that could be deemed comparable to The Short North, a part of Columbus that I am familiar with. However, this is not where Andyman's Treehouse (later The Treehouse, now the Tree Bar) is located. Has this gotten confusing to you? Is this a review anymore? This is how drunk I was when I was when I was at The Treehouse.

All right, legitimate review: Drink prices are a bit expensive but standard given the area of town and the popularity of the bar. I dropped $5 on a Stella Artois. That's acceptable given the circumstances.

People have written that it gets douchey on a Saturday night. I was out on a Saturday night, and it wasn't that bad. We were able to find a table on the patio on a beautiful night, so it was a nice, relaxing atmosphere. But, please also consider my Yelp! Review of Brothers in Columbus, Ohio, and realize the bar that I've set for douchebag quotient in an establishment is high. 

The tree at The Treehouse is a tree. I don't know. There's nothing special to it, and to be honest, it's not as awesome as the tree from Andyman's Treehouse. Can you see that I miss this tree from Andyman's Treehouse? Is this more of a review of Andyman's Treehouse? 

Anyway, main point: The Treehouse is a good place to grab a beer and sit out on the patio. I wouldn't spend the whole night there, and I did not, as my friend took me to another bar in the area that was way more low-key but whose name I don't remember because I was buzzed by that point and this happened months ago. But, you know, say Hi to this tree, have a drink, and do a nice crawl of Tremont. You'll have a fun, hipster, treendy (yeah, I wrote that on purpose), walkable summer night."}
{"text":"The Treehouse is by far one of my favorite spots in Tremont. If you are looking for good service, a cool atmosphere, tasty food and a beautifully poured Guinness, this is the place for you.

In the center of the bar is a giant tree which is adds to the cool vibe. The tables around the bar are tree trunk like, which adds to the theme. The menu is small, mainly burgers and pizzas, but they have cheesy bacon tater tots, which is a little piece of fried heaven. The wings are great as well, so no complaints in the food department. 

The servers and bartenders are nice and friendly, no snarling attitude here.The only thing I don't like about this place is that it can get ridiculously crowded with drunks that are old enough to know better. But that is really Tremont as a whole."}
{"text":"Amongst all of the bars in Tremont, what makes you stand out from the rest, besides your location ?! You're right in the middle of Tremont and any Tremont bar crawls and Right across from THE St. John Cantius church (It's pronounced kæn-chis or CAN-chis).

I've put off writing this review because I haven't found anything remarkable to say about here. It's a yuppish bar with a restored wooden interior, a beer list on the walls with 8-10 micros. I'm not that big of a fan of the seating: there's about 3-4 round tables that each seat 4, seats around the bar, and then a few very large wooden booths in the back (seating 6-8). Overall, the space has felt cramped whenever I've been there. Like most other bars in Tremont, the bathroom is in the basement, use the stairs as a sobriety test. 

A couple times that I've been here at weekend nights (with groups of friends), the crowd tended to be a bit older [35-50] during Happy Hour but became younger (though not I just turned 21 young) as the night wore on. Service has always been okay. 

Not that bad but there's plenty of other places in Tremont that I prefer with a better beer selection, better seating, and maybe an identity."}
{"text":"I reserved the upstairs party room for my boyfriends going away party earlier this year. Since it's one of his favorite bars Cleveland, I had to check this place out. Now the only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five, is the price. It was $100 to reserve the room for four hours and my guests had to spend over $400 on top of that unless I wanted to pay hourly after my time was up. It seemed extremely steep in my opinion but we ended up spending well over that, so it all worked out ok.

The bar manager was incredibly accommodating. We were quite a rowdy crowd but he was a good sport the whole time. The room had its own bar and a plenty of tables made out of barrels. Super cute if you like a trendy hipster vibe, which I do. We had the option to add a buffet of certain foods for an extra fee but we had dinner before going out. Over all it was a great place for out party and I would definitely have another there!"}
{"text":"I've visited Treehouse a few times and it is always one of my favorite Tremont spots. When it's warm outside, it has one of my favorite patios to sit on and enjoy friends, drinks and good weather. After not visiting for a while, I recently stopped in on a Friday night and remembered how much I enjoyed this place. They have a decent sized bar, tree-looking tables, and booths to sit at inside when it's cold out. While here, I overheard some people talking about the food and decided to look at a menu. I immediately decided that I had to come back and try their brunch and we were back the following Sunday. Their brunch menu is filled with delicious sounding options and it was so hard to choose. I went with the corned beef Benedict, which might be my favorite brunch I've had ever. It was bread topped with corned beef, hollandaise sauce, and poached eggs with a side of fruit. While I thought it a tad too salty, it was otherwise perfect. My brunch mates both got the big burrito. It contains everything you want in brunch, wrapped in a tortilla. It had tots, eggs, and all the other good stuff wrapped up as one huge burrito! Definitely a must try if you haven't a"}
{"text":"Great gem in Tremont. Great for burgers and pizza. Its been a while since I stopped in (like years) but its now on the CLEseats app which gives a discount of 20% of the whole bill including drinks. Such a great deal. Cant wait to sit out on the patio and enjoy the great weather and food. They also have a fantastic brunch."}
{"text":"Drinks at Treehouse are always fine, since it's usually just beer that I get there.  However, I had their food last night and I won't be going there for food again, that's for sure.  The salad I had was bland and ordinary, could have made it at home.  The buffalo chicken wrap my boyfriend had was greasy and wet, almost soggy.

Treehouse has so much potential but if you're on Professor, skip this joint for food and go down to Crust for some pizza instead."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here. The food was great bar food and the service was impeccable. Perfect for a low key night out with the girls. There is a super nice patio outback with televisions and streamed lights. They had a great craft beer selection as well. 5/5 and will definitely be back when I'm in Tremont. Pictured below is the buffalo grilled tenders and loaded tater tots"}

{"text":"Fun bar, friendly staff. Last time I was there the bartender suggested a drink I actually loved- snakebite- which was cider and beer. Maybe I've just been living under a rock but I had never had one and it was great. 

They don't really have food here- but the staff was VERY helpful recommending a great place to eat within walking distance when we were wanting to grab dinner. 

This place had an awesome interior with the big tree and a fun energy. A great place to grab a beer on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game and has an entertaining atmosphere. Not a wide variety of beer or food selection, but everyone can enjoy something! Love the tree in the center of the room! Great for hanging out with friends and family too, came here to watch the game with 12 others and they accommodated us."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks last night here with some co-workers. We sat out on the patio. Our food was really great and our server was pretty nice. The food just took a little bit longer then we were thinking it would."}
{"text":"This isn't somewhere that I frequent in Tremont,  but we thought we'd check it out after hearing that they began serving food.  What a great idea!  Huge nice patio and what should be a nice atmosphere and now food, woo hoo!

A few friends and I went here after a few drinks and we were starving.  It was around 8pm, so we figured we had missed any 'dinner rush' they might have had.  We sat ourselves on the back patio where there were 6 other tables seated and one server running around in mass chaos.  (Mind you, nobody was at the inside bar besides the bartender.)  At this point, their kitchen had only been open for one week, so I didn't expect everything to run seamlessly.  

We sat and waited for about 7 (LONG) minutes for our server to greet us and take our order.  We got a few beers and ordered an appetizer, and food to go, since we already had waited long enough and didn't want to see what type of problems we'd encounter with eating our meal there.  Our tater tot app came out a good 25 minutes after we ordered, fried to a crisp.  I very, very rarely complain about food but we couldn't even eat them.  I can't believe they would even serve them to a paying customer, they must have been left in the fryer for the entire 25 minutes we waited.  

We took the food togo; a meat lovers pizza, philly cheese steak, and a chicken caesar salad.  The salad was fine, the pizza was actually fantastic (in a Stouffer's sort of way) and the cheese steak was just weird.  It was served on a ciabatta bun with a thicker cut of meat on it with the strangest, orangest cheese on it.  Think, cheese whiz.  Weird, and not recommended.  It did come with a side of tots, which they got right this time.  

The server was apologetic and told us that there was only one person working in the kitchen, however they were not slammed by any means with food orders and nothing else was up to par during the whole dining experience.  

I wish it wasn't so cute, cause I would like to hang out there if it didn't suck so bad."}
{"text":"My second favorite South Side bar, when it's not crowded.  

Last time there I spoke with a random pilot about instrument-only flights, he had some hair-raising stories, boy howdy!

Fun to look at inside, not the first place in the world with a tree inside it (think Ground Round in Parma Heights, yes it had a REAL tree in it once) but nice enough, clean enough to float above the dive bar classification without bankrupting you 

I hear they have food now, gotta see for myself when I visit next time."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood watering hole with a fun staff and decent food. 
If you're looking for high cuisine keep moving, but if you appreciate good comfort food and patio living this is a great place."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot.  They have a tree in the middle of the bar and tables and stools made from tree trunks, kind of like the Keebler Elves built a bar.  They also have a nice patio but we opted to sit inside.  Best part, 5 plays on the jukebox for a $1 !!!   We had  a few beers (nice selections) but no food.  There were a handful of couples at the bar on first dates.  It must be a popular place for that."}

It's our go-to bar after football games in the fall and spring.  Their patio is AMAZING.  I'm also perfectly happy with their food, drink specials, bartenders and it's just got an amazing ambiance.

Misses:
It's a bit of a W. 6th Chach bar on weekends.  

Overall though, one of my favorite go-to bars in Tremont."}
{"text":"I rented out the private bar upstairs for a private party. I never knew they had the bar upstairs, and it was perfect for my party. The decor was perfect, and they allowed me to add my personal touch. They offered a full bar with food packages per head. Drinks were all cash. Which was fine. We got our own bartender and she was amazing. She took great care of us, making great drinks and getting us food. Treehouse was more than accommodating to my party. I have always liked the treehouse, but now I love it there. Truly one of my favorite places in the city, and my top recommendation for private bars. I will continue going back!"}
{"text":"Okay, what's not to like about a bar in the Tremont section of Cleveland? If I could move tomorrow it would to be Tremont. Yes. this is the neighborhood of \"The Christmas Story\" (the house is really here) and the hall from the wedding reception in \"The Deerhunter\" but it is just a great place to walk around. 

Restaurants, galleries and shops - what a great place. 

The Treehouse is a good place for a drink before or after dinner. It gets a little crazy after a baseball, football or basketball game and can be quite loud. It has a huge Guinness Toucan painted on the outside back wall and there are two outside seating areas for the spring and summer. (yes, Cleveland has spring and summer).

O yeah - there is a huge tree, without leaves, spread over the bar. At times the testosterone level is off the chart and unattached women enter at their own risk but it is just a fun place to have a beer and meet a new friend."}
{"text":"Stopped here towards the end of Taste of Tremont so of course it was a little crowded here! I had never been before but my husband had. The tree in the middle of the bar is cool and the patio out back was nice. There was live music and seemed like a trendy place. I would like to come back to get a better feel of the place. The beer I wanted on tap was also out, which was a little disappointing but I understand it was a busy day there."}
{"text":"I recommend the Chocolate Strawberry Beer. Simply order the double chocolate stout and strawberry beer....mix in equal parts...it is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I have always had a great time at the Treehouse! We stumbled in there on their 15th anniversary night which was fun because they had a great band and had a slide show of pictures dating back to when they opened. Yikes, there were some scary styles over the past 15 years!!"}
