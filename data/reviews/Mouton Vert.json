{"text":"Great Greek vegetarian restaurant. Recommended if you're looking to eat healthy. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little cafe right on Sherbrooke ouest. The first time I heard about this place we from the Vegan festival a few years ago. This cafe has a small area for outdoor seating during warmer months. Inside, there are a few bar seats by the window and a table in the middle which seats 4 or 5. Definitely a must buy is their home made olive tapenade. They make everything fresh on the daily and display it for hungry customers, along with the hand written menu behind the counter. Honestly this place has one of the BEST cappuccino cafés I've had in the city. There is just the right amount of sweetness, the froth was even the perfect texture! I've had it 3x separate times by different staff just to test it out. Each time the cafés were on point. If you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Tasty veggie Mediterranean \"quick serve\" counter. Good coffee. Juice and pastries also for sale. Super nice staff but slow and confusing service. You order at one counter with one worker then must walk around and pay at another counter with another worker. The iced coffee I ordered at the bar got turned into a 5$ cappuccino frappé at the cash and there was much confusion about a refund. Overall a nice spot but don't expect to get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan cuisine and shop. Filo pastry was excellent, as were the cabbage rolls, eggplant and side dishes. Beautiful outdoor seating for summer in NDG."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Greek and Greek themed vegetarian/vegan resto and épicerie specialising in Mediterranean and Greek Greek Greek food with a veg twist. Did you say \"what the fuck\" to yourself and had an epic spit take at the concept of a vegetarian GREEK resto in MTL? Well ... that happened. Get used to it. Everything here is spectacular. The owner is spectacular and her staff do a spectacular job. This resto is a very well run business with extremely high quality food. The olive oil is 100% extra virgin Greek from high up on the Kalamata mountainside. She's got her own organic oregano field. Let me tell you folks a little something ... you've never tasted real oregano until you've tasted Maggie's oregano ... I know for sure that I hadn't until I tried this oregano. Oregano! That shitty green flakey stuff that they sell in plastic at the Métro market or Steinberg's or at the Provigo is NOT NOT NOT oregano. The oregano she sells here is incredibly potent. A very small quantity yields immense flavour. It's hot! This organic oregano is strong and piquant; a little goes a long way. One tiny flake on your tongue burns ... like oil of oregano.   Also, please do yourself a favour and try the Greco-Canadian frappé with especial Grecian coffee and a bit of milk and maple syrup. It is a thing out of this world. It hits the spot on a hot summer day.   Enjoy and get thee to the (vegan) Greek."}
{"text":"Walked into this small basement place in NDG with my daughter today for lunch.  There seemed to be 3 separate lines, and we had absolutely no idea where to go.    After a minute of standing in the wrong line, we figured out where to wait.    And wait.   And wait.     While we were waiting, we took in all of the noise - yelling and banging.    We saw that the one large communal tall table in the restaurant was full of dirty dishes but had no customers - ok, nobody bothers to clear tables here, I guess.    We checked out the menu and weren't impressed.    There were small plates of food specials and I was surprised - if you're going to display a stuffed pepper,  at least have it standing up instead of falling over with the meager stuffing all over the place. After 7 minutes of waiting, my daughter said to me that the place was giving her anxiety so we left.    Honestly, I wouldn't bother to go back. Teensy and cramped, insanely loud, zero customer service, despite 3 employees being on the floor.   Meh.    We went down the street a few blocks to Vegan Rapide and had a lovely sandwich there instead."}
{"text":"Au Mouton Vert, j'ai découvert un snack bar deluxe. Une dizaine de place à l'intérieur et une dizaine d'autres sur la terrasse. Le service au comptoir est très sympathique. Les serveurs nous mettent l'eau à la bouche lors de la présentation des mets. La saveur des plats et des salades est parmi les meilleurs dans le Montréal 100% végé. J'ai mangé un délicieux fasolakia sur orzo (recette Grecque authentique) et j'ai goûté à la fameuse lasagne courges et sauce tomate qui nous fait regretter de ne pas en avoir commandé +++. Tous les mets et salade sont vendu au poids. Un gros cube de lasagne coûte moins de 7$. En quittant, tu peux en commander d'autres pour tes lunchs de la semaine ou ton pique nique du week end. Pour accompagner ton repas, il y a un frigo rempli de bouteilles de jus frais, de kombucha Rise, d'eau de source et d'eau minéral plate et pétillante. J'étais trop bourré pour prendre un dessert. C'est officiel que je vais revenir, c'est la cuisine végé la +++ savoureuse de Montréal!"}
{"text":"Its in my neighborhood ive been 2-3 times already. The counter ladies are always so nice and vibrant thats insane. They have a large variety of vegan options. I went the other day and had a vegan pate chinois made out of sweet potatoes that was amazing. Prices are fair, i mean its not dirt cheap but for what youre getting its really ok."}
{"text":"Generous portions of delicious food, generous explanations/discussions about Vegan and Vegetarian recipes, super attractive and clean and excellent service by friendly staff.  When we'd eaten, our plates were removed from the outside patio and we were offered two free samples of fabulous ginger balls when getting our gluten-free oat bar desserts. I'll be back for more of the yellow beet and Swiss chard salad, (never knew about yellow beets!)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in NDG! Lovely food and equally lovely people. The food is vibrant, fresh, and inventive and the pantry items they stock are similarly great! I especially love the price: it's one of the cheaper lunch options around at around 7-8 dollars!"}
{"text":"(ou plus précisément 3.5 étoiles sur 5!) Si vous êtes dans le coin et cherchez des options végétariennes et/ou végétaliennes, Mouton Vert est un endroit à essayer! J'ai apprécié la variété des boissons et plats proposés. Enfin de la bouffe grecque sans produit d'origine animale! Il y a un menu fixe (incluant majoritairement des sandwichs et des burgers) ainsi que quelques assiettes qui changent régulièrement et dont le prix est calculé au poids. Il y a aussi une bonne sélection de pâtisseries et de gâteaux faits maison. Laits d'amande, de soya et de coco offerts pour les cafés et thés. Par contre, ce serait bien que les items véganes soient clairement indiqués, autant pour le salé que pour le sucré. Je dirais qu'environ 50-60% du menu convient aux végétaliens. Aussi, je suggère de commander à emporter plutôt que de consommer sur place: l'endroit est très, très petit (ce qu'on ne se rend pas forcément compte en regardant les photos) et il n'y a qu'une poignée de places assises avec des tabourets. Il fait aussi très chaud. Le personnel, qui était composé de 4 employés l'après-midi de ma visite (ce qui est beaucoup pour un si petit espace!), était quasiment trop présent: à chaque fois que je regardais les tableaux accrochés au mur, jetais un coup d'il aux différents produits d'épicerie vendus sur place, etc., j'avais l'impression qu'ils attendaient une réaction de ma part. Au passage, le staff est anglophone et avait de la difficulté à s'exprimer en français. Au final, je me suis senti plutôt oppressé et, aussi triste que ça puisse paraître à écrire, j'avais hâte de partir. Ça n'aide pas non plus que le layout de l'établissement porte à confusion (p. ex. on commande à un endroit et on paye à un autre). J'essaierai peut-être de renouveler mon expérience pendant l'été (avec la terrasse!) et mettrai à jour ma review. En attendant, je recommande Mouton Vert aux résidents du quartier et pour une quick bite et/ou pour des commandes à emporter seulement."}
{"text":"i very very much like the Vegan Cereal here, I'd say its quite unique nobody has it. Must try Bougatsa"}
{"text":"My favourite place for a saturday lunch! Authentic greek food but with a modern twist! I want everything when i come here. They make fresh bougatza on saturdays. Lots of heathy options and lots to do in neighbourgood. Love the pleasantness, energy and decor"}
{"text":"Good veggy sandwiches, jolie green place, with plants and nice terrasse and service. Also in the menu burgers and salades."}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant when I hear about yet another great vegan soup and sandwich cafe. It leads to the impression that soup and sandwiches is all veggies eat. As it turns out Mouton Vert is actually that great.  With a sweet variety of Greek and typical vegetarian café fare, I was really impressed with the quality, tastiness and general mindfulness of the sandwich and ragu we picked up. Oh and the vegan baklava (they make vegan baklava!) was definitely worth while. I don't know why I've never had veggie Greek food before, that was so so right.  It was also a lot of fun to see the staff clearly having a good time- the fellas behind the counter were even cracking jokes with us. I'll definitely be back for another good meal soon times."}
{"text":"I just discovered this gem hidden in NDG. It's a vegetarian restaurant, cafe, specialty grocery store and caterer.   I was invited for a birthday celebration so we had dinner in the private room. On the menu we had: fig pizza, feta spread, tzadiki, olive spread, spanakopita, salad and moussaka. I would give everything a definite two thumbs up.  Maggie and Daniella took care of us the whole time and did an amazing job cooking up the storm.   To sum it all up, it's a great spot for take out, sit down or even a private event. Your taste buds are guaranteed to be satisfied :-)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I'm not usually one to like vegetarian or vegan food, but had to try it given how highly rated this place seems to be. I do not regret it one bit; tastiest dish I've had in a while (vegetarian/vegan or otherwise). Price is very reasonable for what you get. Will definitely be coming here more often."}
