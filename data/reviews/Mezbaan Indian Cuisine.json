{"text":"Make sure you come early for the lunch buffet as they typically stop restocking the buffet."}
{"text":"We didn't feel like cooking last or going anywhere so we got delivery. This was the only Indian restaurant that would deliver to us so our options were quite limited.  It honestly wasn't very good. It was certainly passable, but the serving of butter chicken was weirdly small and the sauce was really thin. And the chicken - I'm not sure but it tasted odd. The naan just wasn't good. It was soggy, just not good. Good things -the vegetable samosas we got as appetizers were awesome. Strangely these samosas might be the best I've ever had. We got Chana masala too and that was really good."}
{"text":"This place would've gotten a 2.5-3 from me if it were in DC (where I'm from), but the Indian food options in Pittsburgh are so lacking and generally worse than this so it gets a 4.  The delivery took forever - around 90 minutes. I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind but I could understand how someone would. The driver apologized profusely though for the long wait.  Weirdly small portion of my chicken vindaloo in relation to the rice.. I eat it together and all but still had half of the rice left when I was all done with my chicken.   HOWEVER! The chicken vindaloo was awesomely seasoned, and the spice level actually came out how I like it. Pittsburgh generally has an issue with spice. I have to choose a higher spice level than I usually would because most restaurants skimp on it. But I ordered an 8/10, and my nose actually ran!! Yay! And not too spicy that it covered up the flavor, either.  I'll order again, because it's the best Indian I've had so far around here, but I've only tried 2-3 other places."}
{"text":"Disappointed ! Their dinner portions are really small. Was disappointed with chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo . Very average taste! Wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for Indian food . I am sure there are better options"}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh! We use to order from them frequently.  Even when things go wrong (which is rare), they always fix it. We moved out of town last year and really missed them. We just ordered from them tonight during a visit and the owner not only remembered us, but remembered their last mistake on our order and brought us a two liter as a thank you for ordering again. Truly great customer service."}
{"text":"I went for lunch buffet on Sept 29 2017. The food is worst. No taste indicting the food was made with cheap ingredients or cooked 2 weeks ago and put in fridge, heat everyday and put on lunch buffet. I could not eat regular capacity. Mostly bachelors who are reluctant to cook end up in this low class restaurant. Though the lunch buffet price was cheaper accordingly there are very few dishes. Only 2 chicken dishes and 2 vegetarian dishes. The pakora was stale and tasteless indicating cooked more than 2 weeks ago. Tandoori chicken and goat biryani were spoiled and tasteless indicating the unsold evening/regular dishes were dumped in lunch buffet table. Not worth your money and health."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant several times.  The food has been pretty good, but the delivery wasn't the best.  Unfortunately, the last time I ordered, the food was absolutely disgusting to the point that I threw the entire dish away.  I'm not sure I'll ever order from here again."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  I had the aloo chole and a couple samosas, and it was absolutely perfect.  I asked for legitimately spicy food and got exactly what I was looking for heat-wise, which can be hard sometimes with indian places."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch here for pick-up this past week, so this review is admittedly purely based on the food. My impression upon picking up the food was that the place was clean, comfortable and spacious - but it's hard to judge that when you're ducking in and out of a place super quickly.  So, I got a LOT of food for about $17. I had ordered malai kofta and samosas; the malai kofta was served in two containers - one with the rice, one with the sauce and cheese balls - while the samosas came in a separate container. I couldn't even eat all of the rice with the malai kofta. And the enormous samosas more or less resembled giant dumplings - one went in the fridge after lunch for another day. The portions here definitely did not disappoint!  The rice by itself, however, was admittedly slightly disappointing. It was just too dry and tasteless - not worth eating without being drenched in sauce. With my entree's sauce, however, my taste buds perked up immediately, as the malai kofta was perfect. On GrubHub this dish is listed as, \"Homemade cheese stuffed in vegetable balls cooked in a creamy and mildly spiced sauce.\" The sauce is definitely not tomato based, which is the traditional sauce listed with malai kofta - but that was just fine with me. As it was I found the dish to be creamy, hot, fresh, and tasty.  As for the samosas, I was surprised to find they were fairly spicy. Rather, parts of them were; I ate half of one with no problem but found that my mouth was suddenly on fire about three bites away from finishing it. I can only assume some sort of seasoning and spice was unevenly mixed into the batch as it was being made. I think had it been distributed in smaller amounts throughout the whole thing, that heat would have gone well with the rest of my samosa.  I admittedly will probably not order the samosas again, as they weren't my favorite take on this classic dish, but the malai kofta was 100% delicious, and they did prepare the food promptly and quickly. I would pick up here again - perhaps even dine in, if work quiets down enough for me to. 3.5 star rating from this diner."}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet.  The hostess seated us and never came back. We were never give menus or asked what we wanted to drink.  The would not say the place was dirtybut it was a bit dingy.  Rather than wait to look at the menus we just decided to grab plates and start on the lunch buffet.  It was not very extensive.  From what I remember it included Naan Bread, some saucy potatoes, chicken masala, veggie fritters, chicken, some desert balls, and a bunch of sauces.  I am not a huge indian food fan and I thought the food was fine.  My boyfriend said it was average.  Not the best or worst he's ever had.  I would probably give them a second chance if I had reason to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them and the food came without any cutlery and plates. In spite of me explicitly asking for it which I have never had to do before. I called back and was told they will TRY to send it in. 45 mins later no sign of it and when I am calling back they don't even pick up now. The whole idea of delivery was that I did not want to have to go out and now I am doing just that to go buy disposable plates and spoons. I understand that people make mistakes but leaving someone lurching with full knowledge of your mistake is just not the right thing to do."}
{"text":"The best Indian buffet in town, and I've eaten at them all.  The food is delicious, and the service is great!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery using Yelp's app and the order was correct, no misses.  The food was Excellent!  I ordered the Goat Vindaloo, Garlic Naan and Mint Chutney.  I didn't expect it since I didn't add plain rice to my order, but it came with plenty of perfectly prepared Basmati.  I like to eat and unfortunately can eat quite a bit, but it came with more than I was able to finish, although I came close, so portion size is more than plenty.  I ordered the Vindaloo at 9/10 heat and it was very and wonderfully spicy!  Very spicy, but not so much that it covered any of the wonderful seasoning of the sauce or flavor of the goat.  Goat is easy to mess up and make tough if prepared too quickly.  They nailed it, it was tender and delicious!  Garlic Naan was delicious as expected and the mint chutney was very good as well.  I'm a very pleased customer and I'll look forward to ordering from them when traveling to Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"Quickly becoming one of the best Indian options downtown, which may say more about the other Indian options downtown than Mezbaan, but I digress.   I've only been in for the lunch buffet, so I can't speak to the delivery service (which seems to be spotty) or dinner.  The lunch buffet is affordable ($10), well stocked, and has a decent variety of staples (chicken tikka masala, naan, Tandoori chicken, etc) as well as less common options (pallak paneer... honestly just the fact that they have pallak paneer added a star to this review) on rotation. The staff are friendly and attentive.   Overall a solid lunch option."}
{"text":"The Biryani was Magnificent!! I love the Pakistani Flavors. Spicy and Delish. Add the Raita sauce and some Chutney with Naan and you can't stop eating."}
{"text":"Horrible. Went in at 2pm and everything in their buffet was cold-curries, rice, veggie dishes. When we told them, the cook put her finger in one of the buffet dishes and declared something in her language. We were there for maybe four minutes max. We had maybe five bites total-my husband and I-and we were charged full price. I served myself very little. In addition, one of their broccoli dishes tasted bad-like it was rancid, unfit to eat most definitely past it's prime. Skip this."}
{"text":"when we walked in, it was so confusing, half the light was off and no other customers inside - odd for a saturday evening. and, someone was blocking the entryway with a step ladder painting the walls - even weirder.  the interior could use some decor. this is the reason for minus one star.  The food though - phenomenal. chicken madrasa, malai kofta, and gobi manchurian, sweet lassi - all cooked impeccably.  best we have had in a long time. very friendly staff. family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Yo. People be complaining, but honestly  Good service. Good people.  And most of these cry babies are privileged. They should be happy that this place even delivers.   And lastly fonominal food"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the naan. It was pretty good. I got the garlic naan. The veggie biryani was not great. Very overcooked and mushy and the only noticeable veggies were carrots. Massive amounts of carrots. If there were other veggies, they must have disintegrated by being kept warm ALL DAY instead of being made fresh. There was also none of the yummy whole spices I look forward to in a biryani. The raita was extremely watery. Probably from sitting out with ice in it all day to keep it cold. The shredded cucumber in it would give you the feeling of plastic in your mouth because of the waxy skins that were not removed."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to order, just leaving this so the manager will see (hopefully). I called in to make an order and they picked up but immediately I could hear two voices talking.  After listening for a bit I figured out that the other voice was a dude calling in to complain about how long their order was taking to arrive and the restaurant obviously had HIM ON SPEAKER PHONE WHILE THEY PICKED UP THE PHONE TO ME ALSO ON SPEAKER. The other guy was getting no kind of customer service at all and after a few times of me saying \"hello? Hello?\" I hung up.  Ordered delivery from Prince of India instead, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. Totally dissatisfied. I called to check the status of the order the guy said 30 more minutes and just hung up on me. I walked in to the cafe after 10 minutes and food was ready and it was on the table."}
{"text":"I have a boyfriend that is not so keen on Indian food but I love it. When he goes out of town, i keep myself on a steady diet of paneer, somosas and naan. I ordered Mezbaan (as it is the only Indian restaurant that delivers to Mt. Washington) a few weeks ago and half of it was really good and the other half, not so much.  My initial issue with the restaurant is a $5 delivery charge. Smithfield street is not that far from Grandview and certainly is not $5 far. I ignored the charge because I really needed masala to survive and pizza just felt like settling. Luckily, the paneer masala was great. There was a great portion and the masala was creamy and delicious. The garlic naan was also enjoyed without complaint. However, the somosas were an incredible let down. There was very little curry, which seemed to be concentrated in one small area, and the rest of the filling was flavorless. I will admit, shamefully, that I will order again from Mezbaan because of how few options I have but the somosas will definitely not be on the menu."}
{"text":"I succumbed to a craving for Indian food. The staff were friendly enough, but my entree was naught but meat in a soupy sauce, the flavor of which wasn't to my liking. It was late, and I got the impression that everything was hastily assembled so everyone could go home. I can understand that, but it doesn't make for a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service. 90 min delivery time and missing food items is not a good start for anyone who ordered delivery. When I questioned the delivery guy on missing items, he said I can't help you and rushed away. The food reached me cold and tasteless. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and recommend it! The staff were very friendly on both visits. It's a casual atmosphere, and an all you can eat buffet (drinks are included in the price). The buffet options were different on the two days I went, and everything was great! I am a bit sensitive to spicy food, and was pleased both times that the foods had a range of spiciness, so there's bound to be something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Just had the 9.99$ lunch buffet today, and I am surprisingly pleased! The food was standard Indian fare, and the service was quite good. I would certainly revisit this place for lunch."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've had downtown.  The buffet is constantly replenished with hot naan and other items.  Plenty of variety on the buffet.  Attentive service as far as drinks and plate clearing.  The food is hot and tasty.  This restaurant opened up where Curry Leaf used to be and they remodeled the front kitchen area slightly."}
{"text":"I placed an order on grubhub and after an hour I decided to call and ask if my food was being delivered anytime soon. They told me the wait time was 90 minutes. My food was delivered in well over 90 minutes. I could accept this if the food was good, but that wasn't the case. My mango and sweet lassis were warm and the food was cold."}
{"text":"Delivery took TWO HOURS when I was quoted at 45-60 minutes. They also did not provide cutlery, plates, napkins, etc  And then, to top it off, the food is a flavorless blob. Hooray!"}
