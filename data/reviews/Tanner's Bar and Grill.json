{"text":"Average food.  Reuben potatoes were lukewarm. Beer was foaming over top of bottle when waitress brought drinks to table. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was decent but not much flavor to the food. Menu was quite limited, mostly fried, fatty food options. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I love Tanners.  But the faucets in the women's restroom absolutely have to be replaced. Who else do I need to contact about this?"}
{"text":"No real complaints.  Went here for lunch with a coworker and the food was good and the server prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"It's a bar, and it's bar food, so set your expectations accordingly and you'll be fine. I've been here a couple times both to play team trivia, and the current trivia host here is one of our team's favorites in the entire area, which is probably the most likely reason we'll return. The layout can be a bit crowded when big groups are pushing together tables if you are trying to get up (to turn in trivia answers, to go to the bathroom, etc.), and I'm sure it's a challenge for the servers (between the noise and the crowd, ours had to go halfway around the restaurant to get around to the other side of our table for taking orders- but to his credit he never complained and was very attentive!)."}
{"text":"I've only been once and won't be back.  This place is pretty screwed up.  Food is awful and, unless you're an off duty employee, service is pretty slow although pleasant enough.  I kid you not when I say that the only way to get a second drink in the place is to be employed there or be  the lecherous old fart (who was obviously a regular) at the bar who must tip very VERY well to receive all the attention he got from the on and off duty female employees.  I really don't have a problem with regulars being treated a bit special but this was disgusting.  At least the single beer I had was cold.

As with many restaurant chains these days, you can't get a burger done the way you like it.  Mine was charred, nasty and served on a bun of sponge with a single lettuce leaf, a few strings of raw onion, and three slices of pickle.  (Sucks when the best part of the meal is the pickle slices.) The chili was as revolting as chili can get and served almost warm.   The \"bowl\" of chili was smaller than any cup of soup I've ever seen in any restaurant.  That is probably a good thing because I couldn't choke down the rubbish I was served.  The \"Tanner Fries\" were OK I guess, if you like room temperature soggy spuds with some sort of parsley flake garnish.  Even the ketchup tasted watered down.

Admittedly I should have complained and sent everything back and I probably would have if I could have gotten someones attention.  There was no sign of management.  It was just easier to pay and go. (The check arrived when my food was delivered.)   Frankly, it was worth the price of the check to get out of there."}
{"text":"Food 3+ stars as my \"eggy\"  sandwich was okay..I got in excess of 2 dozen large fries. My wife loved her iceburg salad. Jenna, our waitress,  was polite, kept our soda refilled, and cute... Great for watching NFL game of your choice. Even though I'm a Lions fan, plenty of friendly game banter from Pack fans. Overall worth going back again if we come that way next time. TV viewing 4 stars.. Jenna..4+ stars."}
{"text":"stopped in here after a badger bball game for dinner. the place was quite empty which was surprising. they had specials on food and beer so i would have thought it would attract a good crowd. not from this area so maybe the location was the issue? 

anyway, service was good and the food served its purpose. worth a shot if you are nearby."}
{"text":"My most recent trip to Tanner's was on St. Patty's Day 2014. My hunny wanted to watch the Badger NCAA tournament game, so we went for that. I've been to Tanner's several times before for Team Trivia, but had only tried a small amount of food. I mean, you can't really screw up beer.

We decided to never return to Tanner's after our experience on St. Patty's day. The TV was too loud and the food just wasn't good. I had boneless wings, or as Tanner's calls them, \"chicken lips\" (wtf?) with buffalo sauce. I consider myself somewhat of a wings connesieur (after all, I did win the Stony Hill Pub Atomic Wings Challenge in 2011). Actually, I dont really consider boneless wings to be wings anyway, but I digress. These \"wings\" arrived and were not even coated in sauce. They were like fried chicken tenders with the buffalo sauce on the side for dipping. I usually roll my eyes when people complain of food being too salty, because I like salt and that has hardly ever happened to me. Well, it happened to me at Tanner's. The \"wings\" were so salty that I couldn't eat more than 2. I was so bloated from all the salt that my ring got tight. Yes folks, Tanner's will give you sausage fingers. People with kidney problems or hypertension should probably avoid Tanner's at all costs.

Oh yeah, my husband got tortilla chips and queso. The chips were, well, chips. The queso was bland and congealed upon being served. Also, the portion of queso was incredibly tiny (maybe 1/4 cup?) and thus the dish had a poor queso-to-chip ratio. We ran out of queso before finishing even half the chips. Sad face. 

Also, they call their burgers \"boogas\" which is dumb and sounds like \"boogers\", which does not make me want to eat one.

Although it hurts me to say this, TGI Friday's across the street is probably a better bet.

EDIT: I was walking past Tanner's yesterday (5/9/14) and noticed that TGI Fridays is now closed. 

The saving grace of Tanner's, and the reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is that their Team Trivia is pretty fun. Maybe just stick to drinks though if you go."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm not sure why the bad reviews....I visited Tanners while in town for a training.  My co workers had gone here for dinner and spoke so highly of it we went for dinner the next day! It was great.  The server was high energy and very friendly.  I ordered fried pickles and a Ruben.  My friends ordered cheese curds, and chicken lips.  Everyone loved the food and the atmosphere.  The Ruben was the best I have ever had!!!  I would be there very often if I didn't live 5 hours away!!!  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Tanner's is a one-and-done for us. Although it's been hard to get a business in here for the long haul, including two iterations of Italian-style restaurants, Tanner's 'redo' of the space is a complete disaster.  It looks like the Northwoods or Backwoods, and not in a charming been-here-forever kind of way. It looks cheap and haphazardly put together, but there are dozens of TVs big and small to watch various sports.  Add an uninspired menu, and I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Service was slow (not even crowded on a Tuesday evening) & food was just ok. Seems to be a lot of great options in the area...this one didn't impress."}
{"text":"Just an update.  My husband and I still went here pretty regularly since we like the drummies.  We won't be back again after our experience today.  They brought our beverages, including our toddler's milk, and we all drank our beverages while we waited for our food.  A couple minutes later, our son started projectile vomiting in the restaurant.  We cleaned it up and asked for our food to go.  My husband tasted our toddler's milk and it.was.rancid.....  OMG.  We told the server about the milk and they were nice enough to give us a gift card, but we won't be returning to use it.  Our toddler proceeded to throw up for most of the rest of the day.  If they aren't watching their milk for spoilage, what else aren't they watching?"}
{"text":"Seated ourselves like the sign says and the waitress, Abby showed up to our table in less than 1 minute. She was great! Very sweet, timely and helpful!

Lots of TVs. Kinda dark lighting at many tables but good for TV watching. I was expecting worse because of some of these low reviews but was pleasantly surprised by the service, the atmosphere and most importantly, the food.

I got the honey BBQ battered and charred chicken lips and they were juicy and super delicious! What a fun twist on chicken! I will be trying more flavors but I'll skip the char next time as I chomped into a couple of overly charred pieces and couldn't get the burnt taste out of my mouth for a while. Super delicious otherwise! Reminded me of ribs without the bones! I also tried the tater tots. Nice seasoning and crunch while being really soft and fluffy in the middle like a tot should be! 

Hubby got a fish sandwich and he scarfed it down! See pics below.

Tips: 
1. Be aware that your tater tots might taste like fish fry in case you're not a fish fan. 
2. Get lemons with your water, for sure. Very tappy tasting."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The grilled chicken Lips  and chicken wings are really good and the ABLT is amazing... Great beer selection and a great place to watch the game whole heartedly recommend this place"}
{"text":"On a business trip and needed a late lunch. What happens when you are driving around and don't know what to do?  You go to a bar?

I ordered a cobb like salad with chicken  First question - chicken batter fried or grilled?  Whoa!  I'm from California where nothing healthy is batter fried.  I went with grilled and added a half avocado for $1.50.  Honey mustard dressing.  I would say it's a big salad that isn't that bad. What drove my rating down was the cheese curds or shall I say, fried cheese sticks?  The first sign was the shape of them.  Oddly all tubular.  Upon tasting, the bite was similar to a cheese stick.  Shame on you for claiming these are cheese curds.

If I didn't have to be at work that night, I would have tried the mules since it was mule Tuesday.  I'd be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Meh. Period. Beer in plastic cups tasted funny. Skipped on the food and went across the street."}
{"text":"Came here and the server was really nice. I had a nice cold ciders boy with a nice chilled glass. But truly delicious we're the chicken lips and the mad city flavor. I had them battered and charred. Definitely try."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another shot, it was good.  We started out with buffalo chicken rangoons, those were quite yummy. The chicken quesadilla was ok- our server is what made our meal great! He came by and checked on us all the time and we were never low on drinks. All in all, if you're looking for some fried foods this is a good place for that."}
{"text":"We met as a group before a high school football game.  Asked for a room, put us in a room with one long table ,not enough for our group, number of people had been mentioned.  Food was good, fish fry is very nice.  Problem was because we were a group our waitress couldn't  have cared less about us, she was already guaranteed her tip.  Didn't want us to go the bar to get drinks because that made her tip less, I suppose.  Didn't get our drinks or food forever, late for the game and she got a big tip.  Never again.
This was the Middleton, WI location"}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times now. I think I like it more and more. They really have good food. Lots of choices, all has been very tasty and good portions. Service has been good too. Its definitely a sports bar - lots of TV and a bit noisy if a game is on - but the food rocks and there are so many TVs that it has to be a go-to place for games. Looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Tried this place when my brother was in town and we wanted to grab lunch with my husband, as it is located close to his work. I'd been wanting to try Tanner's for a while, as I'd often passed it while at Greenway Station, but sadly was disappointed with our experience here. It may have been me, but I didn't get a great vibe from this place inside. It had plenty of tvs, typical of sports bars, but it didn't have the fun comfortable atmosphere most sports bars have, in my opinion. The tables and chairs seemed old and uncomfortable, and the inside felt very small, dark, and crunched. The menu seemed to offer a lot of options, but no one in my party was impressed with the food. My brother ordered a fish sandwich that was described in the menu as a huge sandwich, but when it came, it was very small and didn't look appetizing at all. My burger was okay-nothing great, as was my husband's sandwich. The fries we got with our meals were luke warm at best and needed salt or some type of seasoning, as they had absolutely no flavor. For the price, there are many other places in Middleton I'd rather go than here."}
{"text":"I like to come here for drinks every so often. It is never really too busy, and I see what people say about the slow service. Most tables don't see well taken care of that I have observed; I also choose to sit at the bar, so have not experienced the table service myself. The food is not something that brings me in. I have tried different things, and I would only recommend the chicken enchilada soup. Grilled cheese, egg sandwich, reuben, tots...no good. I have had 3 bloody marys there (made by different people) so far and only liked one. They are $4 on Sundays, aren't \"loaded\" at all though"}
{"text":"I've been to Tanner's many times, as I work close by, but stopped in last night after work for some drinks with friends. They had their Taco Tuesday special, which was 3 tacos for $1.50. I favored the beef over the chicken, and I will probably order only beef in the future. You can choose either hard or soft shell, and the tacos come with copious amounts of lettuce and cheese, as well as sides of sour cream and salsa. The food is definitely worth the low prices, so I think we are going to make it a weekly tradition."}
{"text":"One thing, our waitress was great. She was very prompt and accommodating. The problem was when we went to grab the dessert menu. It was covered in ketchup and sticky/greasy stuff. Right there made me wonder about the cleanliness of the place. I had to go wash my hands afterwards. Food was ok, typical bar food. The dessert wasn't very good, I had the salted Carmel cheesecake, which tasted very store bought and \"fake\" for lack of a better term. I would go there to have drinks, they have great long islands but I don't think I will be back for the food."}
{"text":"Got a response to my previous review on Tanners from the manager! This was a first for me since I have been yelping!!.More should read reviews and do likewise..He had a reasonable explanation for the Bud Light price[it was a special for theUW vs Nebraska game only,and price was not programmed into computer so bartender guessed] He took blame for not pricing and alerting employees...Also received a $5 gift card."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly, good food. very happy without visit. We were hungry, in the area so we took a chance. Their fried pickles are one of the best I've had, the wiki chicken very good."}
{"text":"Recently had Tanners on a Thursday night, bar was fairly packed. We had 3 in our party and grabbed a table off to the side. We looked over the menu and our waitress came out and took our drink orders. We ordered a turkey wrap, chicken lips and some other sandwhich. The chicken lips were boring, nothing special liked the menu portrays them to be.... I really want to like Tanners however I can't stand the crappy food. Last time I visited i had a chicken parmesan and it wasn't all that great either. Guess I will stick with Cheeseburger in Paradise, Claddagh Irish Pub, or TGI Fridays if i want something even half decent...."}
{"text":"Food was very good and portions were perfect. Side salad was good size and had bacon bits. Bloody Mary was very good."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a star. Was supposed to shoot in a dart league at tanners from fall to spring bringing at least 8 people every other week on a Thursday. Shot there one night to come back then next Thursday to be told by the waitress that the manager told us they did not want us there to shoot darts and it's not their problem. Never had a bar/restaurant turn down customers before.  The manger would not even come out to talk to me to explain why they didn't want us there. We are not a loud rowdy group. The worst part is they had advertised in their bar about shooting leagues there!!!"}
{"text":"Solid American fare. Got a spicy/hot chicken quesadilla and a beverage. It was hot, melty, with a nice crunch on the inside, but not overly spicy with a clean and simple but enjoyable flavor. Just right for what I wanted on a random Sunday evening in late spring, quick, tasty and clean. 

Upon entry there was a nice sign clearly stating  to seat yourself. The place was clean and upon sitting I was immediately greeted. My beverage was provided promptly by the staffer, who was super kind and friendly (even the other guests were nice, pretty kind atmosphere and vibe all around) and food order taken as soon as I consciously figured what I was going to eat. 

Overall what you'd expect for digs serving American fare/a sports bar with a nice vibe and kind staff."}
{"text":"Good spot to watch sports, good location w/parking.  Everything else is just...meh.  Which pains me, because in a sea of chain restaurants, a standalone spot could do really well at this location... but Tanner's has  average food, service, and atmosphere.  It's large and open, so you can usually find seating for groups up to 6-8- which also makes it extremely weird for groups of 4 sitting at a large round table.  Menu is extensive, but the ~4 times I've been there, nothing really jumps out as great or memorable.   Soda is really sweet, rum (that they swear is Bacardi) tastes weird, and service is just ok.  Based on the location and prices I just expect more."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times when staying in Middleton, it was within walking distance to our hotel.  The food is typical pub fare, but everything we ordered was good.  The staff was very friendly and had some good suggestions for local beers which we low to try when traveling.  Would definitely go back if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good in my opinion.
Waits can be little long if lunch hour or busy.
Prices are just OK. You get alot of food the pulled pork is amazing. Pretty friendly employees with my experiences"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Huge servings. Friendly service. The fish was fantastic. Cheese curds are a must. So glad we came!"}
{"text":"This is purely on their lack of flexibility regarding football games on Sunday.  The place was mostly empty.  Lots and lots of TVs.  We wanted a particular game on a larger TV.  We asked for it in an area of the restaurant where there was NO ONE ELSE.  I am talking not a soul  Their answer; the manager set the games for each TV, he is not here and I cannot change them (assistant manager).  My friend and I left and went to Monk's.  Customer service folks....customer service.  We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Do not bother, really...the food is average, the service simply sucks. I was there on Saturday 10/8 around 8:30 PM, we waited for about 20 minutes while the servers simply ignored us despite us trying to get their attention, especially a short blond waitress which refused to tell me her name, even though she served the table next to ours.... We had to get up and request services, got the food without utensils, they forgot the appetizer as well.
Go somewhere where customers are valued.

UPDATE:
The manager contacted me , his response shows super quality on his behalf, no doubt he really cares about the place, I am impressed. I hope to see more managers like this around.
just wow!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Really good appetizers, especially the fried pickles and onion rings. Burgers are always cooked to order."}
{"text":"I came here with around 20 other people, and they were able to accommodate us pretty well (with a call beforehand of course). Server was nice, though a little impatient. Very chill atmosphere and a lot of options.

Menu is pretty large. I got the ABLT, which I actually really enjoyed. Bread was toasty without butter and was dressed well. I love avocados, so that made the sandwich even better. Ordered it with sweet potato fries, which were good (though a tad too salty and very inconsistently cooked). The orders of the people I went with got mixed up, and some people didn't get the items they asked for, but I didn't expect much from one server waiting on 20 people (I thought they would assign at least two servers for us).

For the number of people we had, service was pretty good, and the food came out at a reasonable time. I think I'll come back soon and try something different (with definitely less people)."}
{"text":"Ate the best egg sandwich ever. So good it deserves a yelp. Our server, Jena, was great and went above and beyond. I'm surprised Tanner's doesn't have a higher star average."}
{"text":"Out of town on business and gave it a shot. Sat at the bar...little real service, nothing friendly about it. Food was pretty much like any other, nothing to remember here. Would recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I arrived here at 7:30 PM on a Wednesday night after a local recommended the place. 

The place was extremely busy. It was music trivia night. There was no hostess just a sign that said seat yourself. I found a seat at the bar. I was dining alone. 

The bartender was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. It took her a bit to acknowledge me but when she did she was super friendly. She was keeping up with all of her drink orders and still trying to talk with her bar patrons. 

I never received a menu but I looked it up online while I waited at the bar. I ordered a lemonade and a chicken quesadilla. Prices seemed reasonable. The selections were typical bar food. 

15 minutes after I ordered I started to realize something was off. Most of the people at the bar were waiting for there food. No one was eating. Food was coming out of the kitchen few and far between. All the waiters and waitresses seemed super stressed. Waiting around the kitchen looking frustrated. 

The bartender then told the gentleman beside me she would go check on his wings. She came back empty handed. The two ladies beside me waited and waited and when the bartender brought out their food she apologized to them for the wait. I heard the lady say it had been 50 minutes since they ordered. 

It took 45 minutes for my quesadilla to come out. The bartender apologized to me for the wait. But I really wish she had told me when I ordered how long it would be. The really sad part: the guy next to me who ordered before I got there got his 5 chicken wings 5 minutes after I did!  He had to wait almost an hour for 5 chicken wings!

The kitchen was obviously backed up and having issues. They were not equipped to handle the business that night. It affected my whole experience."}
{"text":"I'm quite shocked that this place has lasted as long as it has in Greenway Station.  Working close by, I've seen so many different restaurants in and out of that area.  Tanner's has always just been \"OK\" from what I hear.  I could never speak for their food because I've only visited a few times for one or two drinks after work.  The bar is always busy but the service is typically slow.  I don't believe that any of their staff enjoys their job - or they all just have resting b**ch face.

A couple of coworkers and I stopped in for lunch on Wednesday around 11:30a.  Originally the restaurant was pretty quiet and I could see a couple of employees sitting at the bar watching people walk in and seat themselves.  I wondered how long it would take for someone to come over.  Our waitress did greet us and get our drinks quickly but that'll be the last nice thing I say about her. She came back about 10min later to take our food order; egg sandwich, Tanner tacos and Chicken Philly Salad.  Both of my coworkers raved about the tots and finished their meals.  I rarely finish a salad but this one was delicious.  It had the perfect balance of salad greens and toppings and I always appreciate a salad that has greens instead of iceberg.  The chicken was sort of crispy but it really complimented the rest of the veggies.  

The reason I don't give another star is because of their service.  The restaurant started filling up rather quickly after we placed our food order and you could see our waitress panicking.  All of a sudden she was just MIA.  We could see all of the other tables looking around for her as well.  It took 30 minutes to get our food, she never returned to refill drinks and then it took 10 minutes for her to get us our bill after we had to ask.  We noticed another waiter and how he was basically running the entire floor himself, even taking over her tables.  We felt bad that our tip was going to our waitress instead of him considering all she did was take our order and give us the bill."}
{"text":"Tanner's is a typical sports bar with many TVs. I've been here several times for lunch. The acoustics are bad and the place tends to be very noisy. 

The menu is basic bar food with burgers, wraps, salads and appetizers. The burgers are very good. Charbroiled and very large. The avocado BLT is a triple stack with 3 slices of bread. Too tall to bite thru. The turkey ranch wrap is excellent. I would usually recommend the tater tots but today they  were so heavily salted they were inedible. The pub chips are a hit. Crispy and lightly salted. Overall the food is good and the portions very large, I always need a box for leftovers. 

The service tends to be slow. If they had one more server I think the complaints would cease. My server today was running her butt off and did a fair job of keeping up."}
{"text":"It is your typical sports bar, but the food is pretty good and they have relatively good service. There are certainly worse spots to go and this therefore rates as one of the better places for a sports bar venue."}
{"text":"We found Tanner's this past summer.  We like sports pubs and eating at Hi-tops or the bar.  So the atmosphere is nice.  We have been there at least 10 times since our first visit.  Other reviewers are accurate in saying the service depends on the server.

Most of the time we have the burgers, and they are very ggod, usually cooked right, but the fries are always scarce,.  I even contacted the manager via their wbsite and all he wrote back was we feel we give comptitive protion sizes--I counted them one time--14 fries and they were not big fries.

We went last time about two months ago and quit going there when were told a buger was on special, the bill came and I asked about it.  The manager came over and proceeded to tell me I was told wrong, but did not offer to meet the told price and I mentioned the fries to the waitress as i ordered and she assured me I would get an adult, not child portion--I got the latter.  

We like the place, but now haven't been going since then.  Our first time was the very best service, and its slipped slowly since then.  We continue to go to Greenway station, but to the other restaurants instead about 6 or seven times a month since we live near by and shop there often."}
{"text":"Great bar close to hotels that are basically full of EPIC trainees that want to keep a buzz going after the free happy hour. Get there before 9 as Tanners specials also disappear like the free wine and beer and munchies/small dinner the hotels provide. 

Seriously loved this place because co workers and new friends met that night wanted to keep the energy going. I had to study, but when in Middleton...you get the idea. 
People nice, they understand the crowd, they get the receipt correct for business travel, and the food is pretty tasty

What am i missing about lower ratings. I had a wine for 2.50, salad top notch, wings that were fried, tossed and then grilled, rueben skins. tried a black bean burger and the taco specials.
Wish we had this where I live or have lived, prices are crazy cheap and the quality is great and honestly, Wisconsin people are as nice as they come and no one says that anymore. These are great peeps. 

It is bar food, expect that. They won't make your burger rare, but they will make it cheap on Wednesday. My friend loved the black bean burger. Monday's are wings 50 cents and Tuesdays are 1 dollar tacos. 

Get your head out of the books and manuals and relax here. 
You will meet some more nice people and have some great bar food. I almost want to say it is like Cheers. Wednesday had trivia night. Easy parking or walking from hotel and large menu items. 

When taking classes in Wisconsin, and close by, pretty good place."}
{"text":"Bored, I decided to give this one a try. In retrospect, I should have stayed bored. Tanner's is a Midwestern chain of sports bars. In fact, I was at one a few years ago in Overland Park, KS. I don't remember how it was, so this review is based solely on this location. 

The decor is sports bar, the walls are decorated with Badger paraphernalia, there are a couple of big screen televisions, and the classic, not as young as she wants you to think, bleach blonde bartender with bad skin, is working the bar.

Can they screw up a Fat Tire? No, they can't and if all I did was drink, the review would be higher in the stars category. However, I made the mistake of ordering something to eat. I ordered Chicken Lips, which is Tanner's take on chicken fingers. Tanner's version is bland, tasteless, not greasy, but rather kind of sinewy and dry. The sweet potato fries were soggy, not crisp and again, bland.

It is odd to me that such a bar would set itself up across the shopping plaza from TGI Friday's, offer relatively the same bar food and yet prepare it worse makes no sense to me. Maybe the business formula of putting a sports bar in a corporate park, surrounded by a few corporate motels and hoping the deuche bag creepy business travelers will flock to your door to sit around make small talk with the bar maid and spend their expense account on beer is the one they presented to the bank. I guess we will wait to see how long this one lasts and who the next tenant at Greenway Station will be."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday around 6:30 PM.  Service was slow and they seemed to be short-staffed for Saturday evening.  All of our meals (bacon cheeseburger, chicken sandwich and tacos) turned out good. 

However, the reason for the 1 star review was an issue with an appetizer we ordered.  We wanted to order the chips and salsa for $4.99 and then add a side of queso for an additional $2.00.  Our server misunderstood our order and we only received chips and queso, so we asked for some salsa as well.

When we received the bill, we were charged for chips and queso ($6.49) and a side of salsa ($3.00).  When we asked our server about the pricing for the appetizers, she told us that there is a menu item that only includes chips and queso and then thought we also wanted a side of salsa.  We then double checked the menu and showed her that chips and queso wasn't a listed item.  In spite of this, she continued to argue with us about how the bill was calculated.  We eventually spoke with the manager on duty who explained that the menu had recently changed and the computer could still ring up old menu items.

Overall, while it was only a few dollar mistake, our server handled it very unprofessionally and it left us with a bad impression of Tanner's."}
{"text":"First time at Tanners and we won't be going back.  The restaurant was busy but the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our food and one item never arrived. The table next to us was filled with dirty dishes and was never cleaned the entire time we were there (2 hours). The manager came over to apologize for the wait and offer a discount.  When the billed arrived, no discount and the item we never received was still on the bill. We let our server know if these mistakes and the manager did fix it but even still the experience was not good so we aren't rushing back."}
{"text":"Came for the first time and had a good experience. There is a parking lot out back, a outside patio out front, and a pretty big inside seating area. Lots of huge TV's and projector screens that had many different sports playing in addition to sporty decorations, I would imagine this place would be a great place to watch a game. They also have lots of happy hour specials and food specials for each day of the week. I ordered the Mad-Town Booga (their way of saying burger), with tater tots, along with a frozen raspberry margarita. The burger was huge, done well, and overall tasted great! The tater tots were good too, nothing overly special about them. The frozen raspberry margarita was refreshing and tasted good as well, however it didn't really come out frozen, it was mostly liquid with a little bit of frozen chunks at the top, which would be my only complaint about it. I went on a Thursday night, we found a table to eat pretty easily and service was quick."}
{"text":"Waitress flipped my sandwich onto table but I ate part of the other half. Then noted my SW Turkey sandwich was missing cheese and spice. She said I thought u said Club. I was starving so didn't notice till a 1/3 into the sandwich.  She agreed to bring me a different sandwich and says it normally comes on a roll of some sort even though the menu says white, wheat or rye. I asked for the sandwich to be on wheat and it was delivered on rye.  Again I was hungry and tired of dealing with stupidity so I ate most of the sandwich.  Then ordered a Moscow Mule which I have included a picture of with quote unquote fresh fruit.

I found out that the bartender serving the rotten limes is in charge.  As expected he didn't offer to do anything to make it right but he did agree that the lime was bad.  Dine at your own risk!!"}

{"text":"Since my last review, I've been back a number of times for lunch. First off - the positives -  burger is always excellent.. Service is always excellent at the bar.

That said, this time around I looked a little closer at my bill and noticed a Bare Booga (burger) with cheese, salad, and soda was $14.50 total, plus tip, putting things at roughly $17 total for lunch (including tip).  That just seems like a lot..  

After looking at the bill I realized that the burger is $7.99 (with no sides), cheese was extra (forgot the amount), salad was $2.50 (fries $1.50), and soda was $2.50 (!!)

While I generally like the place, it just took me a while to realize how much I was paying for everything.

The $2.50 soda really surprised me.  Sure, you can take the kinda-ugly-Tanner's cup home, but I'd rather get my drink in a solo cup for $1.00 or more less. 

The salad is pretty good but at the end of the day it's just iceberg lettuce with some dressing, cheese, and crumbled up bacon added.  $2.50 sounds like a stretch for this.

If I could get a burger, salad, and coke for around $10-11 before tip (what I'd consider a fair price) I wouldn't argue.  Not sure I'll go back with the current pricing scenario.  I can go to culver's and get a very serviceable meal for $8, why should I pay 2x that to sit at Tanner's bar?"}
{"text":"I was one of a group of 6 people who came in to watch the playoff football game at Tanner's. When I asked for the channel to be changed to the game that we went there to watch; the guy behind the bar, Matt, stated \"It's 3:30 now and kick off isn't until 3:35 - don't worry, I will turn it on when it's time!\". The server immediately apologized for his rudeness. I told her it would not affect her, I just simply won't go back. I will go to one of the more established sports bars in Madison, instead of supporting my local community - I live within walking distance from Tanner's. By the way, I found out that Matt is the General Manager.
PS: Fans like to watch pre-game."}
