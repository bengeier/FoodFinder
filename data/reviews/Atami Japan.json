{"text":"Best sushi rolls I've ever had! Waitresses were very quick, attentive and friendly! Prices were also reasonable. The Mai Tai was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I had the Surf & Turf.  It came served mostly raw on two stones at 800 degrees.  They can cook it for you at your table.  I opted to cook it myself.  The lobster was larger than I expected, probably 8 oz.  The steak was New York Strip. The meal was delicious.  The waitresses were friendly and professional.  This is the best Surf & Turf I've had in the area."}

{"text":"Love the food options. Good service. The stone meals are really good choice. The place good decorations. Good location. Must visit in NH"}
{"text":"I went here, and it was okay. The costumer service was average and there was a few miscommunications involving my order. The food was okay, the steak was kind of gummy tasting. Not one of the best places to go, but not the worst"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  By far the best sushi in the east burbs and fantastic hibachi (although not made table side).  Also the hot stone is fantastic.  The portions are exceptional and the bento lunch special is amazing.  Service is excellent and the staff works extremely hard to make you happy.  If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Of all the sushi restaurants in the area, this is the best I've had. The spicy tuna and the crab rolls are my favorite. You cant beat the sushi lunch speials either. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"The sushi is very good but everything else is definitely not worth the money, I would much rather have the hibachi at Yokoso or anywhere else honestly. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary.   The food was excellent. We both enjoyed it: I got age tofu, and avocado rolls.  The green tea was authentic Japanese.   My husband got a grilled steak hibachi dinner.  The decor is beautiful with low lights.  It is larger inside than what it appears to be.    The service was excellent.  Staff greet you on entry and are very attentive.     Here is my only complaint. There was loud modern country music playing.  When I say loud, I am talking loud enough to be in a bar.       I do not like that style of music , and it seemed out of place in a Japanese restaurant.  We would eat here again but only if it were not so loud.  As someone with a hearing deficit, it was difficult to hear anything except this music.      We would get takeout from here ."}
{"text":"This place just opened up close to me so I figured I'd try it out. The service was good and the food was tasty. It's not your typical hibachi, they don't cook it in front of you although they do have an option of black rock cooking. Inside was very warm and welcoming and so was the staff. They have a nice bar area and the whole place has an overall authentic presentation.  Would recommend for a nice night out with the family, friends, a date, etc."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service have been here a half of dozen times it's our go to place. They have many items of food on the menu and the Hot rock is awesome. Would recommend."}
{"text":"So great. Sushi is amazing, service is friendly and fun! Best Japanese in the area for sure. I would give them more stars if I could."}
{"text":"I'm my opinion this is the best sushi in North Huntingdon. I haven't had anything here but sushi but I've looked at the menu and it's a nice selection. I will be trying the steak and will update"}
{"text":"Atami Japan offers a pleasant surprise in Japanese style food that easily surpasses the chain \"Hibachi\" steakhouses you see in strip malls across America.   Atami offers the standard hibachi style dinners and dinner combinations but where it differentiates itself is in their \"SteakStone\" entrees.   SteakStone refers to a 800Â°f stone served to you with your choice of meat ready to cook. We thought this might be a bit of a gimmick but in practice, it results in meat cooked exactly to the temperature you desire and makes for an interesting and fun meal.   Atami also offers a large selection of sushi and sashimi as well as Thai dinners and Bento Box lunches.   We have never been disappointed in the quality of the food at Atami, with the ginger salad, miso soup and tempura appetizer all being excellent starters.   For the main courses, the quality of the steak is also excellent and the sushi variety and quality also very good considering the location and price.   Overall the cost reflects the quality and the value is excellent.   We would definitely recommend Atami Japan."}
{"text":"Food is decent here, but nothing to go crazy for. The yum yum sauce and teriyaki both taste interesting and different from other hibachi joints. Different isn't always good. Three of us ordered takeout hibachi meals and 5 sushi rolls, which gave us a rather hefty bill. For the money, we could have gone to Yokoso and had a mountain of food, cooked to perfection twice and still had leftovers. They gave a small helping of everything, including the rice and veggies. The steak was cut up into about 8 little pieces, the chicken had about 12. It just wasn't a great experience paying that amount of money to get a meal that could have easily been duplicated from the stir fry bags at Giant Eagle. I'll be sticking with Yokoso from now on.  Edit: I'll give an additional star as I forgot to comment on their sushi. We got a few eel, a spicy crab and a couple deep sea bomb rolls. They were good and not crazy expensive, so there's that at least."}
