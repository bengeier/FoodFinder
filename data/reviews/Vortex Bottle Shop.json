{"text":"This is our first visit, but it won't be our last. The beer and wine selection is fantastic. The tap selection changes throughout the day. The food was so good. The atmosphere is inviting and relaxing. The staff, including the owner, work the floor and are very attentive."}
{"text":"Once I heard this place opened I had to try it out. I thought it would be so nice to have a local spot to hangout on a girls night out and not have to drive into Charlotte or Concord. If we want to Uber instead of have a DD the cost would be more like $5-10 instead of $30-50. I was really hoping I wouldn't be disappointed and I wasn't! 
They have local beers on tap, by the bottle and wine by the glass and bottle. By the bottle is much cheaper, FYI! 

Matt, the owner, served us and was so helpful! He described the wines and helped us narrow down our preferences easily and then the bottles began to flow. A few people ordered food and it looked amazing. I had a bite of a friends PLT, it was to die for! My sister had the flatbread pizza which was also delicious. 

Matt told us that they also offer gluten free wraps for all of their sandwiches which is a big bonus for us since my kids are gluten free so now if I want to bring them here for something different I think they will find some unique options to try and enjoy. They are also rolling out a vegan menu soon!

We will return again! We had a great time."}
{"text":"I have never been to a bottle shop before but I was impressed by the variety of beer and wine they have, as well as having a selection of beers on tap. My favourite thing about this place though was that they give you samples of whatever you wanted to order, if it's on tap. This is great because I would have the option to have a full glass or pick something else if I realized I didn't actually like it. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Had a great time here on my first visit. They had a modest but nice selection of beer on tap, and the food was better than I've had at similar types of places. A few of us ordered different dishes to share, and so far the pesto chicken panini (not sure of exact dish name) was the winner.  They were well staffed for a new spot, and overall I was really impressed! Looking forward to coming back and trying some different options."}
{"text":"Great selection of local and small batch beers on tap and in bottle. They have a large selection of wines! The owner and staff were friendly and helpful. 
I have not eaten there yet but their menu was tempting and others at the bar raved about the food. Great new spot!"}
