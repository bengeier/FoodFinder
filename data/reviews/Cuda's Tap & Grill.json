{"text":"This little neighborhood gem is tucked in a tiny plaza on Lorne Park Rd. but is not to be missed if you are in the area. The pizza and soups and daily specials are always excellent and great value for the money. It is tiny with a few sit-down tables and a good sized bar but the food and ambiance is homey and worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant in our neighbourhood and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and service. The menu has great bar food but they also serve pastas, pizzas and specials. The food is prepared daily and it is fresh. They also have curry on the menu and I have to say it is one of the best curry in GTA (I'm a South Asian and love my curry). This is going to be our regular spot to dine in Lorne Park."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this place a 5 next time....it opened a bit late this time and I was pressed for time, so had to rush a bit.  Nonetheless, the food was fantastic! I kept it simple and went with halibut fish and chips, paired with an amber ale.  The portions were generous and the chips were definitely fresh cut.  I enjoyed those (and to be honest the fish too) with Cuda's home made curry sauce which was very good.  I will definitely be coming back and trying some of the spicier curry offerings!"}
{"text":"Being from Southern California I was here at the wrong time. Freezing my butt off, every trip to the rental car was like suiting up for a space walk off the international space station. After going through a long list of possible places to stop by for dinner on Yelp something caught my eye with Cuda's.  Are review that stated \"neighborhood\".

I walked into the place at first impression, its small cozy, warm or warmer than outside for sure!  and everyone knows each other. One chair available at the bar was greeted with good attitude and a smile. By the time I finished my meal, this California guy was  having a good laugh with the locals, great bunch of people, I was so impressed, I had a great time.  For having been there only once, its a place I would for sure miss, I will eventually be back in Toronto as my work request and yes I will head back to this place.

I saved the best for last:  Two people running the show, supper cool lady serving drinks bring out plates very busy but I was never left un attended and the Chef, I can not bring my self to say \"the cook\" because the level of detail put into the dishes is asking for perfection.  My pasta was perfectly cooked, chicken was not dry, this guy even poked his head out and asked me if I was ready for my main meal after my appetizer.  Oh how I hate my meal to arrive while I have not even stared with the appetizer.  No... Mr. Chef went out of his way, to ask me personally, \"let me know when you're ready\"  dang man, I need a place like this in my neighborhood in California. 

Nicely done, good food, good people, good service, plenty parking, what else is there?"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for a small neighborhood place.  The sole waitress is the owner's daughter - honestly, a 5 star restaurant will be lucky to have someone like her, funny, friendly, professional, and very familiar and proud of the food! She told us that everything is prepared when ordered, so if there's any special request or dietary concern they can 100% accommodate you. 

The grilled calamari - instead of rings, is actually tender baby squids that are cut into sections, with a sauce on top.  For entrees, I am surprised how delicious the curry is. Okay, well, curry is supposedly a popular British pub food, but this one, a water downed version of Indian curry, has a great flavor and very tender chicken pieces.  For the fish & chips, the batter is great, but the fish texture is not that great.  The steak is juicy and tender.  

When we asked for the wine list, our waitress told us that she is the walking talking wine list.  They have a small selection. Small as in, if you want white we have pinot grigio or chardonnay, but don't go asking for the vintage or winery. Similarly, they only have a few beers, but they do offer beers from Port Credit, a micro brewery nearby."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended and I left disappointed. The skimpy lamb portion of the curry dish was half fat / half lamb. The draught beer was not cold. Maybe it was an off night ???"}
{"text":"This is literally one of the best restaurants I have ever been too!! I'm from nyc and have had a lot of great food but I will always remember every trip to cudas! I've never gotten the same thing twice, and whether it's their apps, meals or desserts you can't go wrong! I only have 2 gripes: 1) that there aren't US locations and 2) that I haven't had everything off their menu yet. Not to mention, such a wonderful family business full of smiles and laughs!"}
{"text":"Very nice local spot with great food.  Basic but tasty wines and good beer selection.   We had fish and chips, steak salad with Portobello mushrooms (more steak than salad), and calamari. The owners daughter was so attentive and friendly.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I live in Florida and travel to Canada frequently, I stumbled upon Cudas by accident, it turned into me eating there 5 out of 6 nights during my stay. The owners/staff are top notch the food is amazing, I have been in many Canadian provinces  from west to east coasts and have not found anywhere's that compares. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"A favourite of ours for a number of years and I don't really understand why it has never shown up on yelp before? Soups are always a 4-5, curry chicken is a 5, chicken fingers are a 5 as well with our kids. The only issue now is with it now showing up on yelp they might get too busy:)"}
{"text":"This place is basically an institution in Lorne Park. Terrific food and service. Family run business, everything is made to order. Have never left unhappy...Curry and fries is a must."}
