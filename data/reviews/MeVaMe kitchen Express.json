{"text":"The food was soooo good ! It's like your classic middle eastern food with a modern twist.   I had the shawarma chicken box with potato wedges (16.90 including tax) and didn't expect the portion size to be this generous - it can almost serve 2. I usually don't like salads but the \"ME salad\" was exceptionally great and the ingredients complimented each other well. Next time I'll definitely try the grilled vegetables as a side though as the potato wedges were just too filling.   Service was super quick even during the busy lunch hours and the servers kindly gave you whatever sauce/dressing you wanted in a little tub. If you want a seat during busy hours though make sure you get there early cuz this place fills up.  Kind of overpriced though or else I would've given 5 stars. Overall, a must if youre around the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and love the food but I have an issue with the staff. There is a lady at the cash (don't know her name but she is blond), she is extremely rude to the other staff. Every single time I've been here she is yelling or demeaning someone working there. I hope the owners read this and if they have a way of contacting them I would be more than happy to let them know the details."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, good staff, quick service, good food. The laffa wraps are my favourite, the only bad thing is that they don't put baba ganoush in laffas unlike other mevame locations"}
{"text":"BEWARE: Do NOT go to this location. Decided to give this new one a shot because I had a great experience at the Queen St express location.   We were the only customers there at it was before the lunch rush and only my food came out, not my boyfriends. After waiting another 20 minutes,  it still had not come out and I had finished my food already (which was not great by the way-lentil soup had no flavour and was room temp) They had forgotten to make his falafel laffa-which is baffling since there were at least 12-15 staff members working. They promised to remake it and FORGOT again, to make the laffa. I am not kidding here.   And to top it off-My boyfriend asked for a refund at this point which ended up taking 7 minutes!   The staff and owner are completely incompetent and like they have no interest in doing much of anything. Customer service FAIL. will not be returning here and highly recommend none of you do either! I would give this place 0 stars but 1 is the lowest I could give."}
{"text":"Fantastic food cool place excellent manager\"   Pending review  As some of you already know, form following my posts, my wife and I are world travelers and foodies. We have been to other middle eastern style restaurants before but there was something special about this quaint restaurant.  Basically it was the taste the décor and the manager making sure we were happy and satisfied with our experience , which we were. What struck me first was that the décor was more modern and contemporary and upscale without being too extravagant or too simple compared to other restaurants of this type. There was a line up ,all 3 times (yes we have returned twice since our first experience and plan to come back again!) that we came which is a testimony to the excellent tasty food.  Although the line ups were there the staff were able to keep the line moving and serve everyone efficiently , that the line seemed to be constantly moving forward and the wait was really not an issue and lasted no more than 10-12 minutes. I have certain food allergies and the manager was terrific in firstly checking all ingredients for me and then following up with us personally ensuring that our order was done right..Pretty impressive for an extremely busy establishment. The food was terrific . The laffa (flat pita ) is cooked right in front of you in a stone oven fresh to order and it alone is unbelievable. I can never get enough of this.  we ordered a mixed plate of dips and appetizers all of which were fresh and tasty with our favorites being the beet salad and Moroccan cigars. My wife had the chicken skewers which were tasty and seasoned well and cooked to perfection and very juicy. I had the salmon dinner which also was cooked perfectly ( most similar restaurants have a tendency of overcooking the salmon skewers leading to a very dry and non enjoyable meal) and had an amazing seasoning blend ,yum! Both dinners came with generous portions of veggies and salads that have an \"in house\" dressing that is so good they should sell it for take home!  The meals are great value as well and we left stuffed and happy.   As you can see we now have been here 3 times and will continue to come to this restaurant many times in the future. If you have a line up when you get there you will realize why after you eat your meal!  Highly recommended loved it!  *     Value  5    Service 5    Food 5"}
{"text":"Came in at 9 pm and was told that they are open until 10 pm over the phone. Was not even let into the restaurant. Horrible first experience to a place that I was awaiting to try for a while as they took forever to open this location. Not a great way to start your business especially in your early phase when acquiring customers is a priority. Good luck. Will not be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. Great food and atmosphere. The prices are standard with the exception of the laffa bread and hummus(almost $9 for a container of hummus to go). My boyfriend and I are vegetarians and get the Grilled Veggie,Falafal Laffa Wrap on most occasions. The toppings for the wraps are great. Lots of flavor and variety. The thing about this restaurant is though, it all depends on who is making the wraps. When it first opened we tried it out and the wraps were HUGE. Toppings were falling out of my wrap and I had to eat the wrap with a fork. It was refreshing to go to a restaurant that was not stingy on toppings/vegetables. As the months went on the wraps got smaller and smaller.We were quite disappointed because we are spending $10 on a wrap and when we got the wrap the first few bites were all bread. We decided we could no longer call our order in for pick up, we had to make them watch it to ask for more toppings to be added if there was not enough put on. On occasion there will be a decent amount of toppings added but it really depends on who makes it. Recently on three separate visits items were missing from our order. We had added the chips on to our order and they were not in the bag. Another time we had the falafal balls and the side of tahini sauce was missing and another time a couple toppings were missing from our wrap. Note to anyone who gets the Grilled veggies as a side or in the wrap. I found the veggies coated with oil. Personally I don't like a lot of oil on my vegetables so I ask for them to go easy on the oil  However, I do enjoy the food here a lot and would recommend it but make sure you get your wrap to your liking and ask for additional toppings if desired."}
{"text":"Bad service bad food and overpriced. Stay away. The food is tasteless and the plate of food I had for takeout was 90% rice and not good.  I don't understand other reviews on this restaurant. The original restaurant on Steeles Ave is excellent. This Restuarant appears to be a really bad franchise and is nothing like the original."}
{"text":"Stopped by here last Monday due to a sudden craving for falafel.  Seems to be a new place because I never noticed it before.  I am glad I chose to try this joint out.  Falafel was large and tasted fresh.  Plus they provided me with one of their speciality green lemonade drinks ON THE HOUSE - an unexpected surprise.    Total cost of meal was around $10.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and massive servings. Schnitzel laffa is my fave. Friendly service. Nice and clean place."}
{"text":"First time here and it was quite a disappointment.   We told them we were new and we're taking our time choosing (nobody behind us) but the worker seemed annoyed already. We had a laffa wrap and a box with beef skewers. We asked if the skewers came with a sauce and they said yes and we asked if it could be a garlic or tzatziki sauce but instead they gave us a pretty tasteless tomato based sauce. It didn't fit the beef at all so we asked if we could exchange and they said it would cost us.  Couldn't even switch it out. Me salad was not good at all and the produce was not fresh. Wrap was okay.   Definitely not worth 30 bucks especially with that kinda customer service. Would not recommend this place when there are so many better places!"}
{"text":"I love/hate this place. The food is delicious but the people are goofs. \"Can I have a larger salad instead of the rice?\"...\"NO\". Really? I mean tell me it will be extra... tell me no problem...tell me something other than...\"we don't have that size.\" That just sounds silly. Everytime I come here the word express just makes me laugh and the gossiping goofballs behind the counter irritate the crap out of me.  But hey the food is great so I keep coming back...urg."}
{"text":"Location: On York Mills between Don Mills and Leslie, there is a private lot (free parking) available. Great place to grab a quick bite for lunch or if you're on the go. About a minute or two from HWY 401's Leslie ramp.  Facility: Modern decor, clean washrooms, TVs on CP24 when we were there. There is a nice flow at this eatery, a line-up queue made separate from the seating area with ample space. Large windows make for great natural lighting.  Food Quality & Price: I ordered a 1/2 Chicken Shawarma wrap which comes with a soup/salad, I opted for Caesar. It was great... and the portions were big. I couldn't even finish it and it was only a HALF wrap! They were also VERY generous with the cheese in my salad which made me very happy. It's definitely great value for the money. Also ordered the Lemonana (mint lemonade slush) and it was VERY refreshing and goes well with the shawarma.   Service: Great service with a smile. Despite being \"fast food\", if you eat in, the staff will bring you your order and check in once in a while to see how you're doing.   Overall: For about $10 a person, it definitely beats out any kind of food court or fast food options nearby for health, variety and atmosphere. I would definitely return or at least try another location if I'm near one. The only downside is how busy they are, and thus, how noisy it can get so sometimes the wait can be quite long."}
{"text":"I have heard many great things about this restaurant, so we decided to try it.  Mistake!!  Portions were tiny!!  Food was overlooked, and bland.  Had the shawarma, was ok.  Again tiny portions!  Cesar salad was a joke, again tiny positions!  I will stick to YUMMY GRILL.  Food is delicious and positions are huge!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there yesterday with a friend.   The food is terrific as is the service.  Everyone was so helpful both in selecting our meal as well as when I also took out a great Greek salad with chicken.   The prices are good and for those that like beer and wine.   They have it.  For any fellow yanks visiting here, you will find Greek salads a lot better in Toronto!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Quality has gone down dramatically!! I Had the beef skewer today and it was the worst I have ever eaten. It really appears like the management is trying to squeeze the last drop of this place. The babaganoush had way more mayo than eggplant. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Queen Street location for months. The first time I went there I LOVED the food and have kept going back. The bread the use is especially amazing and delicious.  Last night we were driving by this location and decided to stop in. The décor was as nice as the Queen Street location. The lady who took our order was really nice. We ordered the Chicken Shawarma Laffa Wrap to share and chicken lentil soup. Even though it was busy, we did not have to wait long for our food. We did, however had to ask the servers twice to cut the wrap in half and had to ask twice for an extra spoon.  I have always gotten the laffa wrap at the Queen location and I was expecting the same thing, however when the food came I was extremely DISSAPPOINTED. The first thing me and my boyfriend noticed when the wraps came was the they were STONE COLD!   The bread was extremely burned, and not even in one spot but everywhere. IT AMAZES ME HOW THE WRAP COULD HAVE EVEN BEEN SERVED ON BREAD THIS BURNED!  The fillings were half (if not less) the amount I get at the other location. There was bareley any meat in the wrap and even my favourite red cabbage did not taste the same.  I  have always gotten the wrap to share with someone because it was so big I could barely finish half but this time I was not remotely satisfied. I think this place just opened recently because most of the people working there looked new. The cooks had to consult each other on how to prepare the various dishes.    Overall, compared to the Queen Street location this one is a great disappointment. If you want to try the real MEVAME food make the trip down to Queen Street where you will try their food at its best. This location I will not return to."}
{"text":"This is a great place. We order their chicken shawarmas 2 or 3 times a week. Always consistently delicious and it's a full meal. Pleasant helpful staff. Unfortunately the numerous poisonous air fresheners in the washroom make it impossible to walk anywhere near let alone go in to use them. Even sitting and eating in the restaurant was not possible for me as the chemical smell from the washroom was so strong."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and right away I was turned off by the staff. I told the guy who was at cash that it was my first time. It took a bit of time to order but there was no one behind us in line and the guy looked annoyed we were taking long. The food looked good but it was lacking in flavour. The box comes with a BBQ sauce but it tastes like tomato sauce. I asked for another sauce. The staff tried to tell me it it was going to cost 99 cents. Why should I pay for extra sauce? If they seasoned it better, I wouldn't need an extra sauce.  Overall, this place was disappointing in flavour and in their customer service. I won't be coming here again. I can spend $30 elsewhere."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma, falafel, quinoa salad, chicken skewers, and chicken schnitzel are excellent. The basic salad is tasty, not just a bunch of lettuce!   The only disappointment is the grilled vegetables. Although there were a variety of vegetables (green beans, carrots, etc.), they were covered in an excess of oil. I couldn't eat them."}
{"text":"I had a ME salad, chicken shawarma and a laffa bread. While the salad was very fresh and decent size, the chicken shawarma was kind of dry and small portion, the laffa bread was just okay too. The prices are not cheap either. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our experience started off confusingly when we got there. We ordered two schnitzel sandwiches and we asked to make one of them a \"box\". The cashier thought for some reason that we wanted not only the two schnitzel sandwiches plus a single side order of fries and salad (that comes in the addition of the box) but rather, an entire addition of a whole new schnitzel sandwich, plus the side orders that are unique to the box. We wondered why the addition of a side order of french fries and a small salad would cost an extra $20, because the employee did not explain that she thought that we wanted a third entree for the two of us. You'd think that she would exercise some common sense in knowing that it is customary for two people to order two entrees. Anyhow, we cancelled the addition of the fries and salad (also known as THE BOX) and placed our order. Then we decided that maybe if we spoke to another employee, they might be able to exhibit some common sense, and add the box as an upgrade to our order. Since we already paid, we expected to receive an additional charge of a few dollars. We then paid the remainder (added to the box) and it totalled to be an additional $9. This seemed a little hefty for a \"Kitchen Express\", but we thought that we would receive an adequate portion. After 15 minutes our food comes. The first chicken schnitzel wrap was correct, but the second (the one upgraded to THE BOX) was not a wrap, but was  a single piece of chicken without any toppings or sauce that were an extra charge. At this point, we were already dissatisfied, but our disappointment increased rapidly when we lifted the schnitzel and found that the $9 addition of the box consisted of a handful (at best) of french fries and salad. This $40 meal was disappointing, so we went up to an employee with red curly hair and pale skin. We told her that we were not pleased that for the $9 addition of THE BOX (which resulted in a $40 total) was an incredibly small in portion, and the order wasn't even correct. Her sole defence was, \"This is the box! There's a picture on the wall.\" I looked at the highly photoshopped wall (comparable to how Big Macs our photoshopped in commercials) and found no new information from that lousy excuse for a photo. I asked her as a personal favour to increase the portion as a side order (for courtesy to a paying customer) but rather, she turned away, grabbed her squirt bottle, and started walking to customers to spray their tables. She didn't finish the conversation, so I left and took my seat in shock. Then, she  walked to the table next to us and asked if they needed anything. We did not receive the same courtesy. As we then finished our meal and were ready to leave, she had the audacity to come over with a menacing grin and a particularly small side of french fries (that I estimate was an additional cost to the kitchen of 40 to 50 cents). She lacked common sense (like her colleague) in knowing whether or not  customers have finished their meal. We left dissatisfied with the wish of going to A&W instead, because we would have received better service."}
{"text":"Had myself the Chicken Schnitzel Half Laffa w/ ME Salad option. Very ample in portion. Couldn't even start on my side salad. It's pre-pay, so you don't have to worry about bill splitting at the end. I paid less than $10 and was quite happy. I've been to the one at Bathurst and steeles, and they compare relatively the same in food quality. I'll come back and support this place in the future."}
{"text":"My new favourite go to place for catering. The chicken skewers with Greek salad and falafel are delicious!"}
{"text":"This new location has an updated decor and much nicer feel. Very spacious with lots of seating and quicker to get certain food items like babaganoush or other dips as they now prepackage them daily and have them ready to go at the cash. Food is still good but still over priced for what you get. Side options are very bland like plain white rice or plain whole wheat pita. It would be nice to have something to add some flavour like tahini/tzatiki. Order a side of baba and it ties everything together beautifully, but you are also looking to spend over $20 per person once you add it. A nice treat here and there but not a place I would eat on regular out of sheer value."}
{"text":"Food is delicious...but this is not \"express\". We waited 30 mins for take out....ugh."}
{"text":"Relatively new location, they seem to be still working out the logistics. So we figured there are two options when you come in, you can order take-out (of course!) or you can order at the counter and they will bring you the food once you find a seat. We decided to eat-in. First thing I noticed is that the order at the cashier was a bit chaotic. There was really no space to line up to order because they set up tables right in front of the cashiers. Also there were people constantly poking into the lines inquiring about their take-out order that they had called-in or ordered previously. Perhaps they can have a dedicated line for take-out pick-ups etc, instead of the customers asking if their order is ready while someone is trying to order. I noticed there wasn't anyone responsible for preparing orders to be picked-up. Not surprisingly it took us more than 10 mins in line before we can order even though there was only one person in front of us.   We ordered the grilled chicken dark skewers box with fries and a ME salad and a chicken shawarma laffa wrap. They give you this tracker to place on the table so that they know where you are sitting. Once we sat down we already noticed there were some problems with the orders at our surrounding tables. They sort of have some waitresses that are responsible for your tables. They can bring you water etc. and update you on your orders. So one table behind us were lacking their chips and had waited a while for it. The other table to our left had a big party but a few people were missing their meal and they didn't receive any of the laffa bread that comes with their meal. We actually waited quite a while before our food actually came, I feel that their kitchen was very disorganized, consistently getting their orders mixed up and forgetting their orders. The people behind us had gotten their chips but the table beside us still didn't get their meals yet, while we were eating. They were definitely not happy.   Overall, the delay in our meals was definitely not a good first impression for us but the food quality was pretty good. The chicken skewers were tender well marinated and tasty. My chicken shawarma laffa wrap was also very good. The wrap was fresh and has a chewy texture that I love. I definitely think that this place has a lot of kinks to work out and is definitely not \"EXPRESS\" as proudly displayed in the name. The restaurant was not even at full capacity when we were there, it was only about 1/3 filled."}
{"text":"Good food, good value. Nothing to complain about, nothing to rave about. It's a staple for us.  If you haven't been, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Me Va Me franchise, and am so happy when I see new locations.   This place offers all the classic Me Va Me favorites, but in a more casual setting. I highly recommend you order the babaganoush, as it compliments all the meats wonderfully.   If my memory serves me, they usually put butter on the rice at the other locations, but didn't do so here. And the meat just wasn't as good as I remember the other locations being.   Still it's a great place. I'll be coming back, as it's one of the best options in the mall it's located."}
{"text":"This place is really new to the neighbourhood as I think it only opened in January.   I've been many times and have been pleased with all the food I've tried from the refreshing lemonana drink to the chicken shawarma to the lamb and the Greek salad. The laffa they make in house is so fresh and a nice treat. Whatever you order be sure to add the tangy amba sauce, so yum!  The service is extremely friendly and attentive. The place is very clean with modern decor and the bathrooms are clean too.   I haven't had a chance to try their beer or wine they have on tap.   I see myself becoming a regular. You can tell they use very fresh ingredients. This place is a nice and healthy change to the other fast food chains on the block."}
{"text":"Tried this last night and got a \"lamb burger stick\" laffa wrap and some falafels on the side. The lamb burger sticks are really just kafta kabobs. It was a decently sized wrap and fresh however, both the wrap and falafels lacked flavor and while edible were tasteless. Service was fine and there was plenty of seating. This would work if you're tired and just want something quick to tide you over but otherwise it is not worth the time."}
{"text":"WOW .....fantastic !! Hopped in here for a quick lunch and it was wonderful. Had a shawarma wrap and it was likely the best I've had in years! They have lots of menu options and can't wait to go back. Service was wonderful and the decor was very nice. Seats about 80 people maybe and lots of varied seating. Love there is a long bar table along the windows."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite locations of Me Va Me in the area. They have good food and very clean. I went there when it wasn't busy and their customer service was good. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Had the lamb burger stick laffa ($9.95) and the minced spicy beef hummus (10.95) today. Both were delicious and super fresh. Lamb burger stick laffa sounds complicated. It's like a lamb meatball, but stick shaped. Almost like a lamb kofta. Something like that. Juicy and quite obviously lamb. Plenty of toppings. More than generous portion. Not enough laffa comes with the hummus. Any hummus. With an order of hummus, one gets two small laffas. We ordered an extra laffa ($2). This is a large laffa about double the size of the smaller ones. We still ended up taking some of the hummus home. This is not to say that the portion of hummus was huge. It was decent (I wish it had been huge). It is to say that more laffa would be highly appreciated. Lots and lots and lots more laffa."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and the food looked quite good, decided to do take out. Unfortunately, my shawarma was very dry and relatively tasteless though which was disappointing. Also had lamb skewers which were good, but the lamb could have been more seasoned. Trying to add some avocado and hot peppers to my salad seemed like a complex production with the staff worried about breaking \"franchise rules\". I told them I would pay extra if necessary, still they seemed really stressed that I asked for a modification.  Asked for some hot sauce on the side, got some sweet BBQ sauce instead. Oh well."}
{"text":"i love coming here and buying their hummus, instead of the premade ones from grocery stores. i've been coming to Me Va Me for years (usually the Bathurst location). i've been here twice for lunch and the management is pretty great here. they ensure that take out orders are ready in a timely manner, as well, making sure the order is fulfilled.   i came for the schnitzel platter the first time with a colleague, it's a mountain of food, yes it's pricey for lunch but it feeds two, with left overs. i've also had the schnitzel laffa and it's delicious, served hot, you get chose your own toppings and sauces. it's not the cheapest lunch option but it's a large wrap that is very sufficient."}
{"text":"Recently opened, this gourmet fast food restaurant joint serves Middle Eastern food. The pita's are very big and very filling. I tried the Chicken Shawarma laffa wrap with a side of falafels. For the sides; hummus, red cabbage, sliced tomatoes, onion herb mix and banana peppers with tahini sauce. I think they are trying to cater to the more Americanized people rather than keeping it the traditional middle eastern sides. Instead of tahini sauce, you can choose a chipotle sauce. This isn't supposed to be a Mexican restaurant right?   Personally, the laffa wrap was tasty. I kind of wish they would give us more varieties on the shawarma. Like the traditional turkey or lamb shawarma but chicken will satisfy my middle eastern food craving for now.  The big disappointment was the falafels. They just weren't very tasty and I left unimpressed with them. I will probably never order them again when I go back.   How does this place compare to Naf Naf in Chicago?? Not even close. However, it's hard to come close to Naf Naf but in terms of Middle Eastern food in Toronto, this is one of the better ones that I have found and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love their vegetarian heaven but the last time when I visited the soup they are selling as a tomato soup is vegetable soup not just tomato. I asked twice to confirm there is nothing else but over all I got a vegetable soup with horrible taste which I didn't order!"}
{"text":"4th visit (2x: in restaurant & 2x: pick-up)  DO NOT DO TAKE AWAY!  To Whom It May Concern,  I bough your Chicken Lentil and Bulgur Soup on Friday, February 12, 2016.  I received a coaster/pager to wait for my order and waited about 10 minutes for.....one (1) order of soup.  There was a couple that ordered after me and received there food and they were reviewing it.  They had said out loud (lentil soup?) we didn't order that and I immediately said that was my order.  I took it from the couple (who were not upset) and then proceeded to return the coaster/pager to your staff members and explained that they made a mistake and walked away.  I would not have been so upset at this situation and make a big stink about it but I am because when I got home and finally wanted by soup, it was luke warm and half empty in the container.  I was not feeling well all day and all I wanted was soup.  I wish I had taken a picture but alas I did not.  I did keep my receipt and my order ticket.  I hope you do not do this to all your take-out customers and sting out on portions.  I am deeply upset, not only because I had to wait so long to wait for a take out order on soup but I paid almost $7.00 for soup that wasn't filled up to the brim of the small little container.  I have always supported your place even though my husband always complained that the price was too much for what you get.  I truly hope you do not do this to all your take away customers because YOU CAN.  I will post this on yelp and all other websites.  I WILL take it off if you can explain or compensate me for the ill visit.  Kind Regards,  Alina"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fast-casual middle eastern joint in the York Mills area, this is your spot. It's not groundbreaking food but it's consistent and good.   I always order the \"ME salad\" with a side of tahini and a side of hotsauce and then I get an order of hummus for protein which comes with their laffa bread. It's a decent sized salad and I'm quite satisfied.   My companions last night ordered the lamb kebob wrap (gigantic), the caesar salad (which looked good and if I wasn't vegan it might be up my alley) and the falafel wrap (also huge).   **A warning to vegans or mayo-haters: These wraps contain their cabbage salad which is made with a healthy portion of mayonnaise. Once our table found that out when we were 3/4 finished with our meal, two people struggled not to throw up after eating.)  At the counter they carry certain dishes like their cabbage salad, green eggplant, fried eggplant and other dips prepackaged if you want to grab them and go.    The location has it's own parking lot and the restaurant itself is quite spacious. You order at the counter and a serve/runner brings you your food. It's not fine dining by any definition but it hits the spot.    Wasn't my first visit and it won't be my last. But we will not be ordering anything with that cabbage again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Me Va Me is one of the best additions to the York Mills area in the past 5 years. Serving incredibly fresh middle eastern food. The Laffa wraps are absolutely massive. The protein (chicken, lamb, beef) are 4-star restaurant quality. The \"plates\" are a bit overpriced. If the prices were slightly lower it would be a 5/5. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now, once to dine in and twice for take out. First time we ate at the restaurant. Very nice decor, modern and inviting.   Had the dip trio platter, Me salad with grilled chicken and falafel plate. Their hummus is good and tasty, I've had much better babaganoush (Famous Laffa) but it wasn't bad and the third dip was eggplant in some sort of tomato based sauce. It was pretty bad and very sweet, if I were to order the dips again then I would make sure they gave me a different dip. I love their Me salad and dressing, the grilled chicken skewers were very good and moist! Lastly the falafel was just OK, lacking in taste and flavor... Needs more seasoning IMHO. Again some of the best falafel I've had was at Famous Laffa. Their portion sizes are very reasonable.  The other 2 times I went was for take out. Had the chicken shawarma box with potato wedges, not bad but the chicken was a little dry. Much better shawarma at Famous Laffa and the potato wedges were OK. Comes with Me salad and tahini. They could give other sauces.   3rd visit ground lamb skewers with rice and Greek salad. Lamb was good and cooked well. Rice was OK, it was seasoned with salt but nothing else and wasn't that fresh, tasted like it was sitting in a rice cooker or warming tray for hours. Greek salad OK as well could do with more onions, cucumber and tomatoes. Considering it's an up charge.  Lastly are the Laffa. So they give free Laffa when you dine in or take out. I think these are different than the Laffa that they use to make the sandwiches which look much bigger and softer. Anyways the free Laffa are pretty bad considering they are made fresh, thin and over cooked and hard. Not soft as a Laffa should be, if you haven't realized yet I'm a big fan of famous Laffa but their food is very very good! I would rather have a pita out of a bad than Me Va Me's free Laffa."}
{"text":"Have come here many times but am now done with this restaurant.  Worst shawarma and falafel ever tonight.  Orders were wrong with missing condiments, bread rubbery, the technique on the roll was horrible with a massive piece of bread clumped onto one side and not tight so it all fell apart, chicken was super dry with no sauce to really be found.   This place can be good but lately it's been 50/50 whether its good or garbage and for the prices they charge which is slot it better be the same every time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location.  The restaurant was clean and well staffed.  The staff were friendly and polite.  I had three skewers: one lamb, one beef, and one chicken.  I also had some nice sautéed veggies with garlic and thyme.  The skewers were excellent.  The beef was my favourite, and everything was very juicy, and tasty.  The veggies were nice and crisp and flavourful.  On an aside, I must maintain a gluten free diet and have some other dietary restrictions.  I was disappointed when I was told that the shawarma was not gluten free at this location, but I am far happier that they told me this so that I wouldn't get sick.  :)  The chef went out of his way to make sure that I was able to have a very good and safe lunch.  Highly r commended."}
{"text":"It isn't the worst place but also not the best either. I ordered a shawarma plate and in my opinion the chicken was dry. Also, 15.95 for a plate without a drink it too expensive. The staff don't look too experienced either."}
{"text":"This place replaced an old favourite; Licks burger. Decided to give it a try last night and it was fantastic. Great portion sizes and the chicken skewers were amazing. Also had the beef which was good. It came with a very nice Greek salad and delicious bread. Will definitely be going back. Although I still miss Lick's burger."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry, very busy place. I love there Lemonade  however is expensive for the size you get... Would I go again, yes.. I like how big is the sandwich, and the flavor"}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch place. Had a meal there on Wednesday. Foods good but the place was VERY busy. The issue...took 40 minutes to get our food!! Had to go looking for the meal 3 times & finally we got the food but we had to leave cause lunch is only 1hr!! Manager was polite & refunded our money. I can say the flavour & quality was there for the food. I would do this again but at a different time of day without the time restrictions of lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken breast skewers box with grilled veggies and greek salad.  The chicken was moist and juicy with a fresh tasting BBQ sauce.  The salad was absolutely divine!  (And I never thought I'd use that word to describe lettuce!)  They even brought some warm pita bread to the table that was so tasty.  I will definitely come back!  I only put 4 stars, as I'm not a fan of pressured up-sells...which I felt they did...but the food was still delicious."}
{"text":"Decently good food, not worth the price. 3.99 for a side plate of basmati rice is a bit ridiculous. Definitely a once in a while place to go to but youd lose too much money going there everyday for lunch."}
{"text":"I had been craving Me Va Me from the moment I woke up yesterday. Though I was thinking of going to the location next to me in Maple that just opened up, I ended up visiting a friend and going to this one. We ended up ordering two laffa sandwiches, one kafta (the odd name of burger sticks) and the other was a chicken skewer sandwich. We also had the infamous lemonana drink (mint and lemonade slush).   The girls who were taking our order were really nice, so the front staff were great. Once we ordered, we got buzzers and sat ourselves wherever we wished. We waited about 15 minutes and then got the massive wraps! And I mean it when I say massive, probably as long as my forearm.   The laffa bread is delicious, I love how soft and chewy it is. It absorbs the sauces from the inside, but stays nice and chewy on the outside. My wrap was great. They're generous with the fillings (veggies and sauces). Everything tasted great.   My friend also had a wrap filled with veggies and sauce to the absolute maximum. However, there was barely any meat. He was trying to find it and had probably 3 tiny pieces. Given the size of the sandwich, it was a bit disappointing and considering how much meat was included in mine. I understand that skewers are a given size and there are a certain number of pieces, but it should be proportionate to the size of the sandwich.    Due to the size of the sandwich and the amount of sauces inside, the sandwiches can get quite messy to eat. My friend took my napkin after using his already, so I asked if he could get me a new one. There were no napkin dispensers anywhere, so he had to go ask someone from the staff. The person behind the counter literally gave him one napkin... we were a bit taken aback by that. It just felt very awkward.   Overall, my kafta sandwich was great, but they should definitely consider putting a bit more meat in the chicken breast skewer laffa sandwich. Additionally, it would be helpful to have napkins more readily available to the customers."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this spot since it was a Lick's, so needless to say, it's been awhile! The inside seems much more spacious than it's predecessor, and provided a nice spot to come and have lunch. It was busy, but you place your order and then go sit down. A waiter comes and brings you your food, so it's not like you have to navigate a busy small restaurant with your arms full of food. I got the chicken shawarma wrap and it was MASSIVE with the kettle cooked chips. Yumm-O! The wrap, (which again, was massive), was my first time having shawarma. I was definitely into it. I think I will try falafels next - another first! Anyway - I was getting full two thirds into my wrap, but I didn't want it to go to waste. I opened it up and just ate the insides like a salad...yummy tzatziki sauce complemented the taste. The kettle chips were a nice side.  The prices weren't terrible and they weren't cheap..but for the amount of food I had and enjoyment it brought, I think I'd say it was worth it.  Can't wait to come back now that I've broken the seal (lol!). Edit: I tried the Falafel half laffa...it was awesome! You get a soup or salad with the little wrap and it was much more manageable to eat. Falafel might be the new fave!"}
{"text":"4.5* I paid this Me Va Me Express a visit over a long weekend and I have to say I was extremely impressed with one particular aspect... Sure, the restaurant was clean and shiny, the appetizers (fried eggplant in tomato sauce and baba ghanoush) were excellent as always, and the pita bread baked on site was nearly perfect. What really caught my attention though was how several of the staff went the extra mile to make sure my grandma and elderly aunt who were with me felt comfortable and welcomed. This sort of service isn't a common experience for a chain/ express venue and I hope it's something that sticks with this MeVaMe location because it will keep us coming back.   Overall a great experience all things considered and MeVaMe remains one of the best places in the city for Middle and Near Eastern appetizers/salads/dips. Some of the items aren't cooked on site and I think this place would be even better if they were."}
{"text":"These guys know what they are doing. The service system is great and they have on the go meals and dine in meals. All in all they have great fresh in ingredients and tasty condiments. The hummus is some of the best you can get at a restaurant."}
{"text":"So Good! A friend told me about Me Va Me so I tried it out! I got the chicken schnitzel box with basmati rice and me salad. Everything was delicious! The portion was huge!"}
{"text":"Service is SO slow! Cashiers are more interested in gossiping rather than actually taking ur order and providing some service! Food is okay but the service def takes it even further down a notch."}
