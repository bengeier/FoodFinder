{"text":"Probably the worst food (and service ) I've had in the valley so far. I am a local and frequent many of the resorts and fine dining restaurants here in Phoenix. We visited Centro yesterday afternoon and lunch took us close to two hours due to the fact that the server was SLOW. It was a Thursday afternoon and not busy. The kale salad was horrible. Bitter and under dressed and 13 dollars for nasty greens.
The chicken I added was dry like jerkey, and an additional 6 dollars. We also had the cheeseburger sliders which were dry and had no flavor. The shrimp wrap, had this weird sugar sauce in it and it was not pleasant. I was super shocked at all of this. As I said I frequent a lot of the resorts and restaurants and have NEVER had an experience this bad. I expect to pay 18 dollars for a salad ... when the salad and chicken are worthy of the expense. It was very upsetting that the food and the service were both rotten. Will be packing my own lunch for the rest of the weekend!!"}
{"text":"As a caveat, this review is for the service, as it was so bad that we didn't get a change to eat here.

We recently stayed at the Montelucia to celebrate my fianc√©'s birthday and after hanging out at the pool in the afternoon we REALLY wanted some tacos. We were in luck! Centro has tacos! When we walked in, most of the tables were marked reserved because they were having a reunion that night. No problem. Except for the fact that none of the servers buzzing around us even pretended we existed when we walked in. There were several other people eating at the restaurant so it didn't seem like they were completely closed. After asking one of the servers whether we could sit down, she thought about it, didn't know and asked someone who seemed to be the manager.  We were informed we could sit at the bar. Ok, no problem. We sat down in front of the bartender, and again, nothing. We sat there. No one acknowledged us, asked us if we wanted food, a drink maybe. Nothing. We finally found some menus and asked the bartender if they were serving food. He said \"Yes.\" That was all. Maybe he just didn't understand that we actually came in for something. We sat there for a few minutes longer being ignored and finally decided we actually wanted to eat something. We decided to drive to Blanco down the road and they were glad to have us as customers. 

I understand they were gearing up for an event, but neglecting other customers does not seem like the best way to do it. Very disappointing for an otherwise excellent resort with excellent service.

The extra star is for the ambiance. Very fresh and trendy."}
{"text":"This was the highlight of my trip!  We had quite the debacle with the hotel staff, but the staff here was superb!  In particular, one woman with blonde hair who worked at Centro Lounge at 6PM on June 14th and at the Oasis Pool the next morning, was the best waitress we have ever worked with!  So nice and sweet and extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.

The food here was amazing!  I highly recommend the fries, they are the best ever.  They put spices and sea salt on it to create a masterpiece.  Highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"We recently enjoyed a relaxing stay for our 14th anniversary and had the pleasure of eating lunch at Centro twice.  Katrina and Nicole were very attentive and friendly.  We also ordered a quick snack poolside and Ricky, Hugo, as well as Luis were fast, friendly and professional.  The burger sliders, Sonoran Spiced shrimp, carne asada and blackened fish tacos were flavorful and delicious.  We live in the D.C. area and travel quite often.  So, we're fortunate to be surrounded by so many great places to dine.  I have to say that Centro lived up to our expectations."}
{"text":"We stopped at this bar when we were visiting the Omni in Paradise Valley on a little staycation.

I will say that the menu is a little pricey. But it's an omni in the rich part of town so that's to be expected. 

Service was great full of smiles and fast. So fast. We barely blinked until our quesadilla was out. 

The drink selection was superb using a lot of delicious high caliber liquors. Don't like booze? Well they still have girly fruity nonalcoholic drinks. The food was also very good though we were here more for booze. 

We had a quesadilla which was really delicious. The guacamole was kind of mild but the pico and salsa were on point. But it did cost 12 dollars and we did want another one afterwards. 

Not a bad place to spend some time by the pool at the omni overall."}
{"text":"Really nice if you're staying at the resort because it's right by the pool.  The food is good and the staff is friendly.  They let you eat in your swimsuit!  Really no complaints."}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for a more beautiful setting. The TV is HUGE and the food is very fresh. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surroundings. Casual. Good service. Nice but limited menu. Sliders and fries were tasty. Good for quick lunch if you're at the resort."}
{"text":"Came here few days ago for a quick bite. 
We set outside and view was spectacular, while you on the pool side, surrounded by palm trees, you can see Camelback mountains rising. 
We ordered chicken quesadilla. It's came somewhat on a smaller side- 4 2-bite only pieces. Guacamole were really fresh and tasty as well as tomatoes freshly cut on perfect cubes, not swimming in its juice like at the most of the places. I would advice chef just charge few more dollars and add few more pieces to that delicious dish."}
{"text":"Great resort bar to grab a drink, watch sports on the large TV's and enjoy the stellar view!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch on the day I was leaving the resort and had a couple of hours to kill. The service was great, she did not pressure me to order, eat and leave, but rather kept refilling my water glass after I was finished eating.  The beer selection was great, the burger itself was very good, although a little over-done (more medium than medium rare), and the fries were wonderfully crispy, not greasy.  Price was quite reasonable for a resort property."}
{"text":"I just want to say that I am writing this review SPECIFICALLY for the service that we received.  I hope that management reads this and recognizes a fantastic employee.

A friend and I recently visited Montelucia to attend one of their 6 week yoga under the stars classes.  We popped in on 11/12/14   (side note, I can't wait until this series comes back in the spring.  It was very enjoyable).  As the class wrapped up, they announced that Centro was featuring a wine & cheese plate special for anyone who wanted to pop in.

My friend & I opted to head over.  I could see that there was some type of large dinner party (30+ people) for a special event out in the courtyard and then there were a few tables that were occupied in the restaurant, along with 1 party of 8-10 people.  Otherwise the restaurant was pretty empty.  

We walked in and my only issue was that we were unsure if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated and we weren't really acknowledged when we came in.  We assumed that we could seat ourselves (lack of a hostess stand) and proceeded to grab a small table outside.  We were promptly greeted by our server and brought menus, both for the wine & cheese special and for the restaurant's regular selections.  Our server's name was Christin.  She was bubbly and friendly and immediately made us feel welcome.  We each ordered a glass of wine and a cheese plate (this plate turned out to be quite large and had 3 generous servings of cheese, a large portion of grapes and some crispy flat bread/cracker type things, along with a small bit of green apple).  Our plates were so large and our table so small, that Christin immediately grabbed another small side table and put it next to us.  Although I wish I'd known what our cheeses were, we dug in and thoroughly enjoyed our food.  The restaurant manager stopped by to be sure that we we were well taken care of.  We never lacked for a thing.

The ambiance was great.  Despite being local, I'd never been to Montelucia and I had no idea how beautiful it was.  The grounds are gorgeous.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  Christin is a gem and I will definitely explore a little stay-cation with Montelucia in the future.  I hope all of your employees are as wonderful as she is.  I was a little sad that the manager was tending to the large party when we left.  I wanted to call his attention to Christin and how great she was.  Turns out that he was busy being a great manager."}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual spots in paradise valley. Beautiful views of camelback and resort grounds. Solid menu and good drinks. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch!  Bright and open, the place is clean and spacious. Our server was very sweet and the food was great. Everything came out fresh and good.  I enjoyed my Tuna Nicoise as did my group enjoy their dishes as well.  The grilled salmon on the salad was terrific."}
{"text":"Good spot for drinks but not food. Tacos took forever and came out cold. No flavour. No hot sauces. Got grossed out when I watched a lime roll on the floor from the bar and then the bar tender picked it up. Burger and fries were barely average. This place is good for tvs and beer. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are not reviews for Centro yet, but I loved this bar/restaurant!  I went during the NBA finals because I happened to be staying at the Monte Lucia, and it was a really fun atmosphere.  It's a really big, open space with plenty of seating and several TVs to watch the game(s) on.  I had the cobb salad which was quite good, and they have great beers on tap."}
{"text":"Dre the bartender was super fun, had great convo, and was willing to make us new, experimental drinks! Best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time. Would definitely recommend this place if you're staying here. Miami chic"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a spectacular lunch here upon first arriving to the resort. We enjoyed steak and shrimp tacos and the best guacamole of our life. Their spice level was gentle yet tickles your throat.

The service was attentive yet very clear that young people circulate into the resort who are not necessarily great servers or well-trained."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! The staff was friendly, the environment was great and so trendy, and awesome mojitos!"}
{"text":"If you're staying at Omni Hotel and feeling hungry, check out this onsite restaurant it's delicious!

Food: I ordered the roasted chicken quesadilla as well as the grilled chicken and green chile sandwich. During my stay here, I probably ordered the quesadilla 3-4 times because it was so good! However, it's not too filling (only 4 slices) and is on the pricy side for more of what I would consider an appetizer even though it's listed as a \"shared plate\". The grilled chicken and green chile sandwich was SOO DELICIOUS, filling and much more reasonable for pricing for what you get. It's 14$ and comes with fries; you will definitely be full after eating it

Drinks: I don't recommend getting a mojito from here as it seems as if it's 90% soda, whereas the prickly pear Margarita was a better bang for your buck ( I recommend it blended, it was a lot) because though it was the same price,$12, you get more for it.

Ambience: The ambience here is also great because there are a variety of seating options (high chair tables, lounge sofas, to regular table seating). This is also probably a great place to come if you're into sports because on one wall they have about 9 huge TVs to make up one side of an entire wall playing sports. 

Service: The service I received here was pretty good! They come help refill your water when needed but don't hover!

Overall I recommend coming here but be weary it's more on the pricey side for casual food"}
