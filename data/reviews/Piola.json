{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Piola. I moved into the building late last year and have probably visited the restaurant, or had take out, close to 10 times already. Eating in the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. Taking out they are always fast.

Must endorse the San Danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do NOT forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. The Diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. The crust here is right up there with Terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

Would also endorse the spaghetti and meatballs, so so tender the meatballs fall apart with a fork and the pasta is perfectly cooked with fresh curls of parmesan all over the top. 

Look for the great daily specials - Wednesdays is half price bottles of wine! So awesome. I believe kids eat free on Sundays too."}
{"text":"I experienced the worst service of my life at this restaurant.  My mom and I got a salad with old, rotten lettuce and when we (very politely) informed the waiter we were told (verbatim)  \"Uh, you're wrong. Ok? You need to know that. This lettuce is fresh.\"  He basically told my 65 yr old mother she was lying, got visibly angry at us, and then sent the \"chef\" out to humiliate us some more, before finally coming back to say, \"So you didn't like the dressing on your salad.  Are you trying to get a free dessert?\" We were speechless.  Never, ever, going back."}
{"text":"I first encountered Piola in Playa del Carmen, in Mexico. There, in the north end of the tourist zone it's a great upscale experience for a night out on vacation. So I was pretty excited to see on land down the street there in the new condo-plex on Queen West.

I see that they have garnered some decent reviews so, while I'm also gonna give them some decent stars I'm gonna hammer them here on the things they need to improve to survive here, because I wanna see them stick around.

In no particular order:

Good (but short) wine list. Chose the Aglianico (which is the same one they serve at LIbretto and available at the LCBO--thank god). A decent chianti is also on offer. 'Nuff said. Yay.

Starters: prosciutto -- definitely a superlative. Melts like Velveeta in your mouth. Beats the equivalent at Terroni/Libretto. Take that hipsters! Now, since you and I are both food snobs, how the hell do we know what Velveeta melts like? Good question. But we do.

So much for \"hammering\" them... but here we go...

Polenta & Ragu starter. The polenta is a superlative... the ragu.. well... it's a bit Chef-boy-R-dee... ... either tune up the Ragu or get rid of it. Parts & Labor do a beautiful polenta appetizer that is/was just polenta. Go with your strength here. (Nothing wrong with the ragu it just ain't worthy of the polenta.)

Pizza: the Lisbona. Worthy and delicious. As good as Terroni but NOT as good as Libretto. Beautiful crust and just a nice combo of flavors. You can't go wrong. But ... somehow, just not the same magic as they're pulling off at Libretto. Don't feel bad, Libretto has strong magic!!

Dessert: the Pana Cotta. Hmmm... too much gelatin. Nice flavor but this could have come out of a Jello plastic cup. Sorry. Tune this up.

Now the challenge ... the ambience... the place is very vibrant and bright. Clearly they have planned and executed a brilliant decor scheme here ... but it's more Starbucks than Dark Horse. Capiche? Your parents will think it's *very* cool. Burn, I know.

There are decorations on the wall made of writing and you can read them ... and it's like ... deep thoughts from suburbanites: \"Who invented spaghetti? The chinese or the italians? Best not to think of this before your food goes cold...\" or something like that I read on one line. Errrmmm... best not to read the walls.

Maybe dim the lights? Just a bit? 

And finally ... our waiter was undeniably super service oriented, a great guy, and good looking to boot, *but* ... tone it down a bit. Don't sell so hard. You think your Terroni waiter gives a **** if you don't like the food. If you don't like it you're an idiot! So maybe a little more of that and little less... mmmm... PIzza Hut rah rah :) 

Piola is also fresh and clean on a dirty strip of Queen West. It needs to find its groove. But right now, it needs some love, so if you've just been ejected from Libretto with a two hour wait, or the lineup is out the door at Terroni... cruise down the street to Piola, give your waiter a death glare, and settle in for some great food."}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta were both amazing!  Its my 4th time coming here and I didn't feel sick or bloated like I do when I eat at Itradional restaurant the serves GMO's to its customers.  

I will definitely come back.  It is some of the best pizza in the city and the home made pasta would have been perfect but the sauce was a bit too salty for me.  

The side arugala salad was perfect!  Very little dressing and very clean - just balsamic and EVOO.  


Great job Piola!!! 

 Oh, the Lounge music was a  little too much.  Not the music i would expect at an Italian restaurant.  

PS this Yelp app sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Piola opened on Queen west about three months ago. I love pizza libretto so wasn't sure if this place would be better but thought I would give it a try. 

I've been to Piola a couple times now and their pizza is pretty good (not quite as good as libretto) but they are comparable and certainly better than other spots around town. And, there re rarely any lineups at Piola right now. their pastas and deserts on the other hand are fantastic. 

The gnocchi Pompei is great, The parppadelle al Ragu Di Carni Bianche is fantastic, 
And the fusili al pesto is ok. Prices are average to slightly higher around the $20 mark for a main course. 

Staff and service are friendly, great atmosphere and ambiance, worth a try."}
{"text":"I actually think this is the best bolognese in the city. Hands down when I want pasta this is my number one choice!!! Service always excellent as well. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Pizza was YUM! I love the thin crust and the amazing white pizzas.

Gnocchi was good. I ordered the 4 cheese which was a little on the boring side but hey its cheese so how can I complain.

I love the chili oil they bring you. That stuff is WICKED!

So overall, go cause your taste buds will thank you. Oh and its not overly pretentious. Just a cool place for a date :)"}
{"text":"Piola is a nice surprise! Someone brought me take-out from there the first time I had it and was impressed by the fresh gnocchi and gorgeous thin crust on the pizza. After being to Rome twice I find it hard to find a restaurant in Toronto with such fresh italian ingredients. In my mind I was picturing a tiny hole in the wall family own restaurant...

I decided to have a sit down dinner and went to Piola and was surprised. If I had walked by the place trying to decide on a place to eat, I probably wouldn't have gone in. It has a bit of a boston pizza/east side mario stereotypical italian eatery vibe.. you know.. checkered tablecloths and such. 

But if you do walk by you should go in! The food is fresh, the service is great and the pizzas are huge but so good that you'll eat it all in one sitting. I found the pasta to be better than the pizza but either is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a cool rainy June night and would have walked right out again if not for the weather. Reason for my apprehension was the big tv behind the bar and the sparse number of patrons, oh and the decor. Very formulaic, felt like I was in an airport restaurant waiting for a flight. I just expected it to be swankier. the menus were a bit sticky and then the waiter came over to tell us about the really cheap bar drinks and pitchers...I really wanted it to book it out of there. I looked around and saw that every table was filled with early 20 somethings drinking pitchers. I was hungry and so was my husband who told me I was acting a bit spoiled. we stayed. and wow!!! the food was terrific!! really enjoyed every bite. yum. Our waiter was also really great at making suggestions for toppings to add or substitute on the pizza and even on a salad. we will be back"}
{"text":"Wow! Love this place. I've been here multiple times... Ordered takeaway, dined in and everything is great!
The staff are A+! Super attentive and fast! 
I came here for gnocchi  night a few months back. They managed to squeeze me in at the bar even though they were fully booked. 
Definitely give this place a try if it's in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"It seemed that our waitress forgot about us for ten minutes and then was nowhere to be found. 

I ordered the pesto gniochi. Nothing special. Also ordered the grilled veggie thin crust pizza. That was a bit better once I drenched it wit a bunch of chilli flakes."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday and was pleasantly surprised! The service was awesome and the menu selection was extensive. We ordered the meatballs (tasted just like Nona's) and then the beet salad to start. Both were fantastic, the salad a bit small but I knew we have a large meal coming ahead. There were so many pizza choices, and some had things I loved and didn't so the waiter was kind enough to accommodate my preferences which alot of the pizza joints refuse. Pizza was thin crust and cooked to perfection. I for sure would recommend this place for a casual pizza night or large groups as they can accommodate several people at a time. They also have drink specials every night; it was $4 bar rail after 9pm on a Saturday which was amazing! Will definitely be back to try their all-you-can-eat gnocchi."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service, along with the pizza, check out the meatballs and bruschetta"}
{"text":"came here for summerlicious 2014 lunch time and left very happy!

For $15 

starter: caprese and tomato salad (4.5/5)
main: vegetarian pizza (4/5, minus one for the goat cheese YUCK)
dessert: lemon gelato with raspberry sauce and frozen raspberries 

the portions were more than generous for such a cheap lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here on the 29th of March for the Lucky Gnocchi Night, which is basically all-you-can eat gnocchi in a variety of sauces.

There are specific seating times for this event - not sure of all of the times, but the dinnertime options were 5 or 7 p.m.

The gnocchi overall was decent, it was kind of hit or miss with some batches overcooked, or too cold, or just right. Our faves of the night were the bolognese, four cheese, and Pompeii (basic, crushed tomato sauce). The pesto one was quite good as well, but the butter sage was flavourless. Service was frequent, but they ran out of some flavours and returned with second rounds of previous flavours instead which I was kind of disappointed in. 

I probably won't return for the gnocchi event now that I've tried it, but may go back to try out their pizzas and other dishes."}
{"text":"The night was young, we just left Vivek's farewell party at Church Aperitivo and walked W on Queen for about kilometre to find out the burger joint we planned for was closed!! Argh

A little bit distraught, we decided to check out Piola which was nearby for some Italian eats. Not bad for a plan B. We heard that this place was good from friends.

Stepping inside, the resto grabs you, this one beautiful looking restaurant, the decor, paintings on the walls, oven area is tucked and visual for patrons, the colored blown glass light fixtures, upholstery out of shirts, they paid a lot of attention to detail. Really a joy to dine in. 

Our party ordered 3 pizzas to share. 

MARGHERITA - Mozzarella and basil 
SALSICCIA E FUNGHI - Mozzarella, Italian sausage and mushrooms
SPARTA - no sauce, mozzarella, goat cheese, black olives, arugula and cherry tomatoes

The pizzas were razon thin. I found them a bit undercooked and flimsy to hold. After downing 4 slices it was unsatisfying. Maybe together with a pasta it would be better. The pizza on it's own is not enough to fill you. 

It was alright. I liked the mushroom sausage pizza the best. 

Nice place like I mentioned the decor is fab, I'd be back though to try something else."}
{"text":"Space and location is great - came in early evening with a group of 3 friends-  was easy to get a reservation and it looked like most people in the restaurant just walked in off the street...so if you're around West Queen West or Parkdale...this may be a safe bet for a place to not worry about getting a seat.

Menu is fairly priced with most pizzas coming in around 13$ or 14$. Wine prices from 34$-70$ and a limited selection (available by the glass also).

The choice and size of the pizzas is quite large - more than 15 types with something for everyone.

Our group of four had a pizza each, but probably could have sufficed with 3. The pizzas were all quite cheesy (maybe too cheesy?) but that's just a style thing, I guess.

Tried the spicy salami, the sausage and mushroom, and the carbonara pizza. They were all OK and made better with their house-chilli oil but these days I'm comparing everything to Libretto, and maybe that's a problem."}
{"text":"First Ive been to several Piolas throughout the world and was really looking forward to this one, was very disappointed.

The good, the gnocchi was excellent nice texture with excellent sauce.  Service was prompt and friendly, pricing is very reasonable.

The bad, everything else.  Biggest issue was the tomatoes were bland and tasteless so my salad wasnt very good and the bruschetta was bland.  Pizza was also a bit on the bland side and undercooked to boot."}
{"text":"Do you know how difficult it is to make a 5-star Hawaiian pizza? Maybe you don't like Hawaiian pizza, maybe you don't care.  But as a lover of Hawaiian pizza I can tell you that is very easy to make a 3-star Hawaiian pizza and exceedingly difficult to make a 5-star Hawaiian pizza.  The one here is it.

The dough was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was delicious. I assume this applies to all of their pizza too. But the pineapples were the perfect size of chunks, plentiful, and did not soak through the dough.  The ham was not thin slices or cold cut ham; but rather thick chunks of cured pork.  Add to that a dash of the chilli-olive oil that they bring to the table, and you've basically got the perfect Hawaiian pizza.  My dad had a different pizza with chicken and it also looked awesome (he said he loved it though I did not try it).

For dessert I had the tiramisu, and I cannot complain - clearly homemade, terrific balance of sweet and coffee flavouring.

Piola is near queen and dufferin, a bit far from the downtown core. I will be back; It is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I like that the servers are all italian and insist on doing things the real way. It's not your average Pizza Pizza so don't go in expecting that. This is Italian fer reals yo!"}
{"text":"Avoid all you can eat gnocchi night unless you want to overload in super starchy carbs. Not a lot of flavour. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I dropped into Piola for a quick bite with a friend.  After spending time in Italy in October I had developed a soft spot for diovala pizzas which is a spicy salami pizza.  This was my baseline for who had the best pizza while I was in Italy.

The place looks pretty slick, it's brand new, very clean and the space looks large. 

I ordered the diovala and my friend ordered san danielle.  It didn't take to long for the pizza to arrive and it looked almost like the pizzas I was eating 2 months ago!  The only major difference I saw was the spicy salami was more of a pepperoni here instead of the salami slices I got on all my orders in Italy but it might be a store by store thing and I just happened to get shaved salami that looked more along the lines of slices of prosciutto. It looked delicious and I couldn't wait to cut in. Yes eat with a knife and fork!

My first bite brought me back to Italy for sure.  Thin crust pizza, with a nice sauce and fresh cheese.  It was very good.  As I ate slice after slice of this thing I knew I would like it.  The major test was how the salami was going to be.  The first bite of the salami was ok.  I prefer the shaved slices more as this salami was slightly more chewy than what I had eaten before and that texture of the shaved spicy salami is a lot nicer however that does not stop the fact that this is a really good pizza!  There is a new kid on the block!"}
{"text":"suuuuuper pricey in my opinion ($17.50 for personal size pizza) but delicious pizza and delicious little pillows of gnocchi! 
i like how there were a variety of pizza toppings that weren't the common western ones but if you're vegetarian, i felt like there weren't many options :("}
{"text":"Piola is the cutest place, its quite modern looking.

My boyfriend and I went for gnocchi night, I myself am the biggest gnocchi fan ever. I will eat it till I burst, he hasn't had gnocchi before and I'm so glad his first time was at piola. He absolutely loves it, almost as much as I do. 

The gnocchi here is made in a less time consuming way, I can tell they get the dough together and just chop it up into pieces instead of rolling and shaping them, which I didn't really like, but its understandable when all you're eating is gnocchi for the night. 

The different flavors, there were around ten, the basics, then a parma ham, a four cheese and a few more I can't seem to remember. The creamy flavors were my favorite they were just the right amount of heavy cream. He fell in love with the pesto.

The reason its at a 3 star, is because the service here was horrid. We waited at our table for 15 minutes before someone came around with water, then another 10 before she asked us if we wanted to order. I'm very picky with my service, not only was she slow, there was literally no one there. I saw how many tables were taken. 

Other then the service everything made my mouth water."}
{"text":"\"You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya punk?\"
If you are lucky (and seriously hungry) and it's the 29th of the month, it's Lucky Gnocchi Day at Piola!

For $14.99, it's all you can eat gnocchi!
You start off hungry and eat yourself into a self-induced carb coma.

12 different sauces. You should try them all.
I discovered that 12 small servings of gnocchi is greater than or equal to the size of my stomach

My favourite sauces were:
Pesto
Four cheese
Bolognese
Pancetta cream sauce

It is AYCE, so it's all about quantity (how much you can eat before passing out) and not as much about the quality (but the gnocchi was still decent).

Depending on which batch you got, some of the gnocchi was over-cooked and soggy or a bit colder.  I'm still not going to turn it down though.

This restaurant itself is casual, kitschy, and fun.
And yes, the chairs made of recycled clothes are super awesome.
The clothes used to construct my chair included a tie-dyed flower t-shirt and blue jeans.  I bet the hippie who donated their clothes didn't know it would end up as part of furniture.

The servers kept the gnocchi coming so if your plate was empty, it wasn't empty long.  We had a large group and the service was great!

I had a great time here! ... I also have the urge to eat salad for the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Piola marks my official first/second Yelp event with fellow yelpers, and when I say fellow yelpers I mean Elites...everyone was an Elite...EXCEPT FOR Meeeeeeee~!

So I showed up to Vivek's 'Community Manager No More' party at Church something Bar, I showed up sometime after 8pm thinking I've arrived early, in fact I was late.  As soon as I showed up, I was greeted by a warm and enthusiastic--handshake--by none other than Jennifer K.  She whisked me away with her gang of (all male) posse from the party that was winding down to her plan to having bison burgers somewhere uncomfortably West on Queen.  Just like that, as soon as I showed up, I was gone.  I felt like one of those asshole celebrities, but I don't associate that with a bad thing. 

Burger joint was closed, and so our search for an alternative became something rather of an adventure, and our adventure eventually found itself in Piola, an Italian pizzaria.  It was one of those thin crust pizza joints, only here everything was thin, including the toppings.  
My weight fluxuates between 180-230lb thoughout the year, the only thing that doesn't change is my insatiable appetite.  A pizza here is fifteen dollars, and it is the size of a frisbee for midget children.  The meer sight of it made me want to hug onto my money as tightly as I can.  It should be priced at five dollars and no more!  This is robbery!  
The décor was unremarkable.

As soon as the food arrived, the cameras came out like a Western gun slinging scene.  Snappady snap snap!  Nobody seemed to mind, a seriously dedicated Yelp moment.  
I had a total of three pathetic slices of pizza which tasted bland, and completely unfulfilling.  It took fifteen minutes to cook, and fifteen seconds for me to eat.
If people are willing to pay these prices for such food, then I should open a restaurant.  I make amazing Italian food!
(Because it's so damn simple to make)

I was so hungry, I ended up going to another restaurant afterwards, and Jennifer was nice enough to accompany me to...uhh...a restaurant of a certain ethnic background...^__^ hehehe



....it was Chinese."}
{"text":"I was so very happy to find out that Piola was within breath of the Gladstone Hotel. My friends and I decided to try the \"famous pizza\" joint after the Elite event...and with all the booze in our system, nothing could be better than delish, cheesy, goodness.

I was so looking forward to Piola and in fact, was a bookmark of places to eat. The food DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The service was utterly atrocious. So, the 4 stars rating is just for the food.

Food. Piola is bright and airy inside and there is even a small outdoor patio in front! My girlfriends and I were quickly seated and brought menu's. Our mouths started to water. We decided to share two pizza's: Burrata and the Sparta. Both were absolutely divine. Both pizza's were nice and thin...so much that you could fold it. But it still had a lot of oomph and character and I was actually NOT FULL after eating 3 slices. I can still taste the Buratta cheese melting in my mouth. The Sparta is one of Piola's cheese-less pizza's and you can never go wrong with a combo of cherry tomatoes, olives, and peppery arugula. YUM! Add to that some good vino rosso and the night is made.

Service. I think we had an off night with our server. Reading other reviews of great service, it seemed almost out of character with Piola. Our waiter was very rushed and impatient. He knocked my friend's bag off her chair twice. Towards the beginning of our meal, I told our waiter we couldn't wait to try the pizza's (and were hungry) and we were ready to order. He said for me to hold on and he would be right back. Would it have been so difficult to remember two pizza orders? And, 15 minutes later...

My girlfriend (probably slightly tipsy from all the Martini's at the Gladstone) wanted Pellegrino water and was asking about the sizes. Our waiter, quite exasperated I might add, answered we have either bottle or can. Can you explain? We have either bottle or can. So...what is the size? Bottle or can.

In any event, Piola is a really great pizza place. I am so sad that it is so far from me. If I am ever in the area, I would SO GO BACK and I think I might venture to have a pizza myself. Although with all the choices on the menu, going with a group ensures you get to taste everything heavenly."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Drake Hotel, and found this place on Yelp (thanks Yelpers!).

We had a terrific experience.  Both the pizza (Honolulu) and the pasta were delicious, and the server ( I believe his name was David) was extremely helpful when we asked questions.

Great food and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for the AYCE gnocchi and I would love to write a great review but I think  Joie below, pretty much hit the nail on the head

We were a large group but the service was kept constant and the gnocchi servers circulating us like a pack of pasta supplying vultures.

The interior of the restaurant is nice, they have a green theme going on from some cool chairs covered in old clothes and walls and shelves made out of recycled cardboard and plywood.

My only complaint is the lock on the disabled toilet does not work (yes I had to use it because I had been drinking) ,  and yes someone walked in on me.

Embarrassing moment aside I am not a big fan of gnocchi having only bothered googling what it actually was that morning and I would like to return here to try some of their other menu items. 

The restaurant was busy for a Tuesday evening and had a nice atmosphere and super great staff which makes a big difference to my experience of a venue."}
{"text":"The all you can eat gnocci nights are amazing. Good food and a great atmosphere. Have recommended to many friends and I can't wait till the new location opens."}
{"text":"My first visit to this Queen West gem was back in January for a dear friends birthday dinner. While parking is the only true issue to this neighborhood (during key business hours be prepared for a mission of a walk) the area is nice and the meal that awaits you is totally worth the wait.

The decor is trendy yet casual and the menus are an easy read. That my friend is the only thing about the menu that's easy because the decisions ahead of you are some of the most difficult I've had to make in awhile. 

If you are there with a dining companion I would recommend the Insalate di pesce as a starter to share, OR if meal sized salads is your thing have at it. The salad comes with a wonderfully nutty arugala bed, and a light dressing that I couldn't quite put my finger on. For toppings there was smoked salmon, shrimp, olives and essentially a can of tuna. You'd think its tacky but its great value when you see the portion size you're getting. As previous reviews have mentioned, the highlight to this flavorful masterpiece is the wedge of brie which sits happily atop this mass of garden greens and savory seafood. By these flavours combined I am Captain Salad!! 

Now friends, Toronto wouldn't be called Hogtown without a little gluttony at times and I, your friend can admit that I am guilty of this sin and was especially this night. As I mentioned the salad is more than enough for two to appetize themselves on but not knowing this before hand ordered it as a starter on its own and proceeded to order another dish to follow. Should have taken the hint when the waiter looked at me with fear in his eyes that a mistake was being made.

I decided on the Gnocci to follow my Insalate BUFFET. A normally heavy meal on its own but following the train of salad, seafood and brie I could hear the angels calling my name as a coronary was certainly imminent. What I will say is the SAWCE....was BAWCE (he he he I haven't used that reference in about 40 reviews - feels good to dust that out again), but aside from the sauce, I felt the Gnocci were terribly dense for my liking and as I polished off my plate like the greedy piggy that I was I realized \"heck this is heavy\".......

.....I awoke several hours later from my food coma, the restaurant destroyed and a feeling of shame in my stomach......just kidding ;)

When it came time for the bill, I found it to be reasonable despite my shameful over indulgence. Our waiter had been attentive throughout the meal and kept his judgements of my gluttony to a minimum (thank you). 

Give this place a shot. Great date place fellas - I think you could really impress a lady friend with knowledge of this little spot."}
{"text":"I still love this resto to death. Tomorrow (February 29th, 2012) will mark their third all you can eat gnocchi day, and you better believe it will also mark my third \"lucky gnocchi\" visit in a row. 

From the food to the service you really can not ask for more. The fact that it's walking distance from my gates is a bonus of epic proportions. 

Love."}
{"text":"After a great UYE we decided to continue the after party (hey its the after you want to be at  according to the most interesting man in the world). The first attempt at grabbing some grub was a failure. Nevertheless there is always something around the corner in this neighborhood. 
This pizza place has decent reviews so we the group decided to hit it. The setup is very vibrant and one is hit with plethora of color when one walks in. 
The menu has a lot of options (including unlimited gnocchi on particular date) but since this place is famous for pizza we decided to stick to main attraction here.
Service was prompt. We decided to go for 3 pizzas (margherita ,  Sparta and Salsiccia e Funggi) 
The pizza's arrived promptly and looked pretty good. The dough is nice and thin, though could use a little bit more salt. Sauce was decent on margherita a pretty good  version of this classic. Sparta didn't fare well much and didn't have much of taste.
I didn't have the sausage and mushroom pizza. 
We have a decent pizza joint here folks 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here two nights ago for my girlfriend's post softball recovery meal. I had read reviews of the all you can eat gnocchi night, and wanted to try the place. It is summerlicious and happily they had a $25 dinner special. 

-I tried the pear, Gorgonzola and walnut salad which was quite nice... about a 7/10, could have used a bit more a creamy dressing. 
-the real star of the show was the boar, mozzarella and onion pizza. Great flavour, nice sweet onion mixed with the tangy boat 9/10!!!!! 
-For desert, I had the Tiramisu, which was good with a nice consistency and a real nice strawberry flavor 7/10

This place is great and the summerlicious menu is a great value. The service was also attendant throughout!

For bonus points take a gander at the weird chairs made out of old clothing.... good and sustainable"}
{"text":"Great service!  Our server was from Italy and talked freely in Italian with one of my dining companions.

Food came fast, and was fresh and delicious.  Thin crust pizza, which isn't my thing, so I had the tuna/anchovy salad, and it was great.  I wish they'd brought pepper to the table or offered some, but otherwise I have no qualms.  Get the tiramisu and a coffee at the end!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here with family on at least six occasions. It's a steady mainstay for dinners out with the extended fam. The servers are really attentive and it's always a pleasant experience with reliably good food. They handle groups of six or more people really well.

I've tasted my way around probably all the vegetarian appetizers and my faves are the Insalata ricca (mixed lettuce, olives, yellow peppers, beans, sliced beets, pomegranate dressing and garnished with pistachios) and the Polenta bruschetta (grilled pecorino polenta topped with roasted cherry tomatoes). 

If you're with a group, the Roka cabana salad (arugula, fresh tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, yellow sweet peppers, pistachio nuts and pomegranate dressing) is tasty and exceptionally large -- enough for 4 ppl to share as an app. Bruschetta and Caprese salad are okay but nothing special. 

My favourite pizza (thin crust, BTW) is the Ortomisto (mozzarella, goat cheese, grilled vegetables and cherry tomatoes). Not only is it delicious, it's a colourful feast for the eyes. I've also enjoyed the Moderna (mozzarella fior di latte, fresh tomatoes, arugula and shaved grana padano cheese). Least favourite of the pizzas I've tried is the Piola (mozzarella fior di latte, sun-dried tomatoes and basil) b/c the sun-dried tomatoes overwhelm everything. 

My preferred pastas are the Gnocchi Pompei (tomato sauce) and a vegetarian rendition of Pappardelle Alfredone (fresh pappardelle with mushrooms, grana padano cheese and heavy cream, hold the ham). I've also tasted the Fusilli al pesto and the Spaghetti alla Crudaiola (tomato sauce, fresh tomatoes, fior di latte mozzarella and basil) and can vouch for those as well. 

IMO their desserts aren't the best things on the menu but the Tiramisu is reliable and large enough for 4 ppl to share. Good espressos."}
{"text":"A very nice gentleman took me here for Lucky Gnocchi Day last night and I think I might keep him (along with the approximately 5 pounds I just put on).

I'd known of this monthly event for ages but never understood how anyone could eat enough to warrant all-you-can-eating. Gnocchi is probably the most filling of all historical foods. But I realized I didn't want to lie on my death bed wondering why I never tried to consume my weight in potato dumplings, so here we were.

My partner-in-crime got the refreshing Red Fruit Caipiroska ($9) which was tasty, but having thoroughly researched the stomach-expanding techniques of competitive eaters earlier in the day, I stuck to flat water.

We also ordered the Barbabietola (red beets, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, fresh oranges, $8) to provide a different texture to chew, which was a good idea. It wasn't the salad I'd imagined, with only 2 cherry tomatoes and maybe half a slice of orange altogether, but the vegetable addition to my meal was so necessary that I didn't mind.

AND NOW FOR THE FEATURE PASTA-ENTATION...

We were served:
- Puttanesca (spicy tuna, olives, capers, onion, tomato - our favourite)
- sage & butter (herb-y and mature - my date's other top pick)
- Crudaiola (tomato & mozzarella - my choice for silver, although the cheese distribution was uneven and there was sadly none of it in my second helping)
- Legnano (four cheese - I was looking forward to this but found it could have been a little creamier and cheesier)
- basil pesto
- Pompei (tomato & basil)

We skipped the ham & mushroom, pancetta and Bolognese, so I'm grateful they offered a fish option, especially since the spicy tuna was the gold winner. The variety kept it interesting and the serving pace kept it feasible.

The gnocchi itself is obviously the most critical factor and Piola gets it perfect: the softest, doughiest nuggets imaginable; so fun to eat and filling, yet somehow not too heavy. I had anticipated some level of gastrointestinal discomfort afterward but surprisingly, I did NOT get pregnant with a food baby.

Altogether I Sonya Thomased a respectable 7 servings and my date Kobayashied 11 or 12. We're \"GNO\"T \"CCHI\"DDING around!!!

In summation: can't speak for rest of the menu, but AYCEG is a no-brainer. Will take me at least 3 months to adequately work up appetite again. Then will be back."}
{"text":"Super nice staff.. weird how the staff seems to be from everywhere except Italy and Canada...  not that it matters cause they were awesome.

Pizza was pretty good.. great crust.. crispy and thin.  

Definitely Om-Nom-eriffic!"}
{"text":"Pizza chains are no rare sighting in the city of Toronto, but I'm glad that there is finally one from our beloved Italy - Piola.  Located at the base of the Bohemian Embassy condo complex, it is sure to become a family favourite on nights when mom just doesn't feel like cooking!

Their Monday Night Mixer features sangria pitchers for $25 which are sure to be popular on hot summer days, especially if you can nab a seat on their outdoor patio.

A fellow Cancerian (Tony F.) and I were celebrating each other's respective birthdays when I decided to check out Piola.  The décor is quirky, and the staff are as international as the pizza chain itself.

The entrance features a display of canned tomatoes as well as Piola's in-house lifestyle magazine which showcases literary and artwork from around the world.

I opted for a Green Fruit Caipirinha ($9) made of Brazilian Cachaca (a fermented sugarcane liquor) with fresh muddled kiwi, green grapes, mint and sugar served over ice.  It was not overly sweet, and a very refreshing summer drink.

We shared the Contadina pizza ($16) which was topped with Mozzarella, Italian sausage, grilled Belgian endive and smoked mozzarella.  The 'zzas here are thin crust, extremely crispy and tasted yummy. For those of you who want to add a little fibre in to your diet, the crusts can be made whole wheat for an additional $1.50.

The pasta was equally appetizing as we feasted on one of my all-time favourite types of pasta, Pappardelle Alfredone ($14).  I just love the eggy-ness of a fresh pappardelle!  This one was dressed with mushrooms, ham, Grana Padano cheese and heavy cream.  It had just the right amount of sauce and just the right amount of salt.  Delish!

For dessert I opted for the Pannacotta ($7), which was velvety smooth and creamy with a homemade red fruit sauce.  The birthday boy ordered a classic Tiramisu ($7.50) which was also good.

Piola is a no-fuss, casual Italian eatery with a quirky ambiance.  The servers are all very energetic and entertaining and the price point is quite reasonable.  I'm definitely coming back on a Monday night to enjoy more delicious eats and a pitcher of sangria!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Great atmosphere, and love the 90s theme they had going on with the music tonight, but the food (although tasty) was lacking uniqueness.

They mainly have pastas, pizzas and other salads and antipasti. It has a great selection for vegetarians, with lots of salads and pizza choices, but very few for non-pork eaters! Almost everything had pancetta or ham, and their homemade pasta sauce is a pork and beef sauce. It was good that it was noted on the menu though. 

The pastas really didn't seem like anything special. Most I felt like I could make at home. I guess that's the way I feel about most italian places now, but some places really do wow me with ingredients or pasta sauces that would be difficult to perfect at home. It could be that I am much more discerning about italian food these days too. My Ditalini with pancetta, onion and pandano cheese was good, and al dente, but a little bland. Spicing it up with hot chilli peppers (Which we had to ask for) made it excellent. 

The hubby ordered the Salmon, Dill and Brie pizza. Very skimpy on the salmon, and maybe one piece of brie (on top of mozzarella) didn't make much of an impression. 
The crust was thin and limpy - not crispy enough. It doesn't beat Queen Marghuerita or Libretto 
The Wild Boar pizza was generous though, but still tasted extremely cheesy.

For an Appetizer, we got the $10 Diced Octopus Salad with Capers, topped with Tomatoes. It was a very generous portion and very tasty. 

Our server was really nice, chatty and friendly. He did seperate bills for us, which was nice. But a little unprofessional when he gossiped a little about an overly perfumed woman at another table.

Overall, we with apps, and drinks it was $60 including tax. Meh."}
{"text":"This is a chain I believe but nonetheless we've been back 2 or 3 times. The pizza is actually quite good. I mean there is better in close proximity however you are pretty much assured a table in much less time and for the that the quality of food is perfectly acceptable.
Recommend."}
{"text":"After speaking to Piola's manager, they now offer vegan cheese for their pizzas. It's Daiya brand, so it's soy-free, gluten-free, and dairy-free. 

The minestrone on the new menu is vegetarian (no beef or chicken broth) and there's a note about the vegan cheese right on the menu! 

The gnocchi recipe is no longer vegan, which makes me sad, but now that I have Daiya, I can have pizza, pasta and any salad with it at no extra cost, so I'm pretty satisfied. 

Still no soy milk option for your post-dinner cappuccino, but I've taken to having espresso like a real Italian and not the manga cake I was raised as. Would love it if they offered a dairy-free dessert as well."}
{"text":"Be careful what you wish for or you just might get it. When I saw the construction for Piola in the front of my building, I hoped it would be good. Unfortunately, it is. The ease of good pizza steps away is definitely not good for the wallet or the waistline. 

Their pizzas are great and in the price range you'd find at most TO pizzerias and they have a good selection. 

The test of a good pizza is always the margherita, and unfortunately this one isn't that great. A recent order left me with an overcheesed, undersauced, flavourless pie. Luckily, they do have a fantastic burrata pizza. Lots of buttery burrata cheese, with delicious tomato sauce and plenty of fresh basil. I'd recommend spending the few extra dollars for this pizza."}
{"text":"An acrostic poem for Piola:

Pillows. Pillows, made from clouds, made of potatoes, made by angels
I'm referring to the hundreds of Gnocchi brothers and sisters bathing together in rich sauce
Often consumed, disappearing, but then reappearing on your plate within seconds
Like Whack-a-Mole, but instead of whacking, you eat them, and instead of moles, it's Gnocchi
All you can eat, that's why. On the 29th of every month. Seriously."}
{"text":"FA-LA-LA-LA-LAAAAAAAAA!!! 

No, it's not Christmas over here, but I feel like singing! I do that sometimes when no one is watching. And sometimes when they are! =P

FOOD
So what has got me breaking out in song?
PIOLA all-you-can-eat gnocchi for $14.99!
I usually have to travel FAR to get good pasta! That's right ... I'm talking Italy (duh!), Japan (yes!) and Taiwan (ya! so true!) ... But in North America, I have only found 2 places that have Italian food that has struck me as memorable! And PIOLA is 1 of 2!
At least for the GNOCCHI. I can't speak for ALL their dishes.

Now why am I singing off key? For starters, Gnocchi is my favourite type of pasta! And the gnocchi here is like eating marshmallow poppers! The dough is so smooth, supple and soft it almost melts in your mouth! And with the AYCE - the servers come by and dance around you all night repeatedly teasing you with 8 different types of gnocchi:

- pesto 
- 4 cheese 
- tuna 
- spicy tuna
- plain tomato sauce
- mozzorella & pork sauce 
- ham, grana padano cheese & heavy cream
- pancetta (bacon), onions and grated pecorino cheese

I may have misheard for the last 3 because I didn't actually try it - fell into a carb coma after the 5th scoop! 

my biggest tips: 
#1 Try them all! My faves were the pesto & four cheese
#2  Drop it when it's hot! That's right - it's tastes best when it's piping hot and freshly served - so don't make the mistake I did! Get more AFTER your plate is clear!
#3 - order OTHER dishes or apps because TOO much gnocchi is too much of a good thing! It got boring after the 5th scoop! Need a little variety to spice things up!

SERVICE
Service was incredible! We had a table of 20 and my plate was never empty! What also impressed us is that for a large party, we didn't even ask for separate bills - the waitress just did that for us! Smart cookie!

AMBIANCE
The interior is fun & colourful! You are surrounded by bright painted murals on the walls and cute pendent lighting float above you. As you get yourself seated, take note of the crazy sculptural clothes-moulded chairs! You have to see it to believe it! 

OVERVIEW
good prices - check!
good atmosphere - check!
good service - check!
good food - check!
and most importantly - good company! - check!

{"text":"If I could give Piola six or seven stars, I would. Not only is the food five-star worthy, but the staff's willingness to go the extra mile is worth an extra gold star and cherry on top of this rating. 

First, the food. The pizzas are really freaking delicious. Thin crust cooked just the way I like: just crispy enough to hold up to the delicate toppings, but not so toasty that it tears the roof of the mouth. The Burrata pizza is my favorite (generous on the burrata and high on flavor), but the Piola was delicious too.  The pappardelle alfredone I had tonight was stellar, as well -- the pasta was fresh (not dried), perfectly al dente and dressed with just enough cream sauce so not to overpower the pasta, plus ham and mushrooms. 

The Cabana salad is also not to be missed, and the staff was nice enough to accomodate my picky palate (not being a fan of arugula, they were happy to sub regular romaine for it, and it was still delicious!). Even the panna cotta I had for dessert was perfect; a light and sweet end to a fantastic meal. 

As I mentioned, the staff at Piola is top notch. They were kind enough to let our decently large party of post #tweetgasm revelers in right before closing and stuff our faces with pizza without making us feel like we were keeping them overtime (so sorry!). And tonight, when I returned, they were super attentive and friendly, even though they were stuffed to the gills due to a private party. The service alone has already solidified Piola's place at the forefront of my Italian loving heart. 

Piola: I love to stuff their food into my piehole-a. I'll definitely be back again. And again."}
{"text":"Sometimes I'm really sad that I can't eat wheat. Like when I'm sitting next to Ben B's ginormous pizza pie. But what I was most impressed about at Piola was the salad, which was meal sized.

My seafood salad sat on a bed of arugula, olives and some \"special sauce.\" There was an assortment of cured salmon and prawns, which were both really flavourful. You'd think they'd stop there, but no, across the plate was a flaky pile of tuna and, wait for it, wait for it, a wedge of brie. 

A wedge of brie. Unheard of! I have never been as full from a salad as I was with this one. Yes, it's probably because I didn't share my brie wedge, but whatever. 

It was getting on in the evening, 9ish, and there was plenty of empty tables. Service was on the slow side, but since it started with a very, very full glass of Prosecco, I had no reason to rush. Overall, mama mia, me likey!"}

Menu items: All you can eat gnocchi

Happy Gnocchi Day Toronto! Every 29th of the month you can celebrate lucky gnocchi day with the folks at Piola with an offering of all you can eat home-made gnocchi for just $14.95/person.

History has it that once upon a time, on the 29th of an unknown month, in a small village in Italy, a missionary arrived upon a very poor house asking for food. He was welcomed to their house and was offered the only thing they had on the table, \"Gnocchi\". The missionary was very thankful for their warm reception and wonderful food. Soon after the missionary left the house, the poor family found some gold coins right under their Gnocchi plate... Since then the \"Lucky Gnocchi Legend\" has gained recognition all over the world. Families gather together every 29th of the month and enjoy Gnocchi in order to have luck and prosperity in their lives.

And now in Toronto, you can celebrate every 29th too and wish for prosperity in your lives, all courtesy of the international restaurant, Piola. A place that has claimed territory on 1165 Queen West, becoming famous for its great execution of those potato, flour and salt concoctions called gnocchi.

From pesto, to basil and tomato, four cheese and even Alfredo sauce, Piola delivers on its promise by offering the best quality, home-made gnocchi one can indulge in, for a dime. Their gnocchi is tender, ethereally light, nicely potatoey and able to stand up to all the sauces offered during lucky night. On the 29th of every month, one can easily be served over 6 different types of gnocchi flavours. Waiters come and go with their bowls steaming with the oeey-gooey delicious nods telling guests what they have in them, and then proceeding to serve onto plates.

Piola gets packed the day of and reservations are often advised for lucky gnocchi days. At Piola, the service is so wonderful that you are sure to be served the best experience on this day. Though I still have to give Piola a run for their pizzas, I am and forever will be their number one fan when it comes to gnocchi.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Once a month they have an AYCE gnocchi event. We arrived at 8:55PM for our 9:00PM reservation and the entrance was packed with waiting customers that had no idea what was going on. When I told the host we had a reservation he snapped at me and told me there were clearly a lot of people being helped right now. I looked at their reservation system near the door because it was on and they had over 12 reservations for 9PM. 

In any case, the disorganization doesn't bother me that much, it was the rude host. He could have simply come over to people entering the restaurant and told them he would be there to help in a minute, instead of leaving everyone in the dark. 

On the plus side, our server was hilarious and very helpful, gnocchi bland and boring. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto. Luckily I have friends that live just a couple minutes away so I always try to make it to Piola every time I come to visit them!

I've had quite a few items off the menu and have never ordered something I didn't LOVE. All 4 types of pizza I've tried from there have been amazing (although my favourite is the Moderna...I'm a sucker for arugula). Gnocchi Legnano is irresistible! Love the Capese salad (fresh bufala cheese is awesome) also really enjoyed the Roka Cabana salad and Prosciutto & Grana appetizer. Although that is usually better to share.

As I said, I've never been disappointed with anything off this menu. Love Piola!"}
{"text":"Stand out food with great portions of pasta and pizza. Nice service and atmosphere is very family friendly (kind of like Eaton Centre's market restaurant). Saw calamari being served at another table and that looked gorgeous too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to go to Piola as I love Italian food.

Alas, was in the area last night and decided to eat here for dinner.
We waited, then waited, and finally waited for some more to be seated. Interestingly, 2 employees saw us.

Finally we were seated.
Same story.
Waited, waited and waited.

Lost my patience and then left.

The End"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise. We went in expecting typical, mass appeal Italian and instead got different and intriguing pizza offerings and an excellent and well-presented stacked salad. We went in 'off hours' and received pleasant service and a meal well prepared. A potential 4-star, but I'll reserve opinion for another visit."}
{"text":"Gord and I didn't feel like cooking so had supper tonight at Piola on Queen Street W in our 'hood.  It recently opened and we've been wanting to try it.

We took a look around the inside.  They have chairs are made from old clothes that have been pressed (like boards).  They are quite heavy.

It was such a nice evening so we sat on the patio.  It was a great spot for people-watching on Queen Street W.

Gord ordered the Carbonara pizza.  He said it was good and would order it again.

I ordered Spaghetti all'Antonia.  The meatballs were really good.  The sauce was good ... I'm surprised that the pasta wasn't fresh, though (it seemed to be packaged).

For dessert, Gord and I split a Torta nera & gelato.  It was really good.  The ice cream contrasted nicely with the warm brownie/cake.  Gord's not into sweets but he said he would order one for himself next time.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"I did a bee line from Piola for my computer to re-check their website and write this review. My guest had a free Margherita pizza coupon at Piola expiring on December 31st, so I checked their website earlier today, December 29th, to see if there was anything else that tickled my fancy. I was struck by the banner ad for their all-you-can-eat Gnocchi Day (the 29th of every month); I read the description about the deal and it sounded like a good compliment to that free Margherita pizza. While on their website, I checked their hours of operation and it indicated that they close at 1 am on Saturdays. My guest and I had never been to Piola before.

We arrived at Piola at 11:15 pm. There were about five other tables full of customers, and we were immediately seated. The server was friendly and told us about their drink specials. We asked the server about how the Gnocchi Day deal works. He advised us that the deal had ended at 10 pm -- I told him that that was unacceptable since there was no mention of a cut-off time in the fine print on the Piola website (re-checked moments ago). We then checked out the menu and they had quite a varied selection of offerings. We decided to get two appetizers and two pizzas, including that free Margherita. When the server returned, we started to order and he told us that the first appetizer we ordered was no longer available as they had discontinued it in anticipation of a new menu coming soon. Then, he remembered that it was past 11 pm and the \"kitchen was closed\" for appetizers and salads! All they had to offer now was pizza, desserts, and drinks. I told him that this was further unacceptable, that I might Yelp about what was going on there, and then he yelled over to the manager that I might complain online. The manager said nothing. Nevertheless, we ordered just the two pizzas and advised him that \"they had better be good.\" Throughout all this, the server remained fun and apologetic.

When the pizzas arrived, they were big, thin-crust pizzas. The Lisbona was tasty and had lots of nice, fresh arugula on top. The Margherita was a bit tragic in that it was soggy  in the middle -- and this is crazy since it's the easiest pizza of all to make and perfect. My guest and I were hungry, so we finished every last crumb of these pizzas.

We decided not to order dessert even though we were still hungry,  and get out of there in favour of hitting Massimo's Pizza down the street to fill ourselves up. When the server returned, we gave him our feedback on the pizzas, and he offered us free tiramisu as an olive branch. No thanks. Too little, too late. In my opinion, the manager on duty should have come over and spoken with us, to try to smooth things over with us.

We'll never be returning -- Toronto has so many amazing pizza places and outstanding Italian restaurants that only a fool would end up there again."}
{"text":"So I'm running around during social media week and well, also writing yelp reviews to procrastinate my real work but needed a bite and some wifi before the event at the Gladstone happened so I went to Piola as it was on my list. 

VIBE 
It's a fun, casual vibe in here. You've got wooden panels on the wall with fresh fruit; a neat black and white photo gallery near the bathroom and colourful paper cloths on top of the wooden tables. 
There's a photo mural of a guy on the door and if you're near the front section, you'll see it. It kind of feels like someone is staring at you with this glare and it's a bit creepy to be honest. Otherwise, it's a fun place to come with friends or family. 
Great bar too.
Kudos to the staff who were hustling. The bartender was serving tables and he was still attentive and quick on our food. Good job! 

WE ATE 
Pizza!  LOVE that they have $8 pizza from 4-7 p.m. duirng the week. Got there just in time! The Bolognese was gooey and meaty and our favourite.  We were recommended the Contadina. It had: 
Mozzarella, Italian sausage, grilled Belgian endive and smoked mozzarella. 
There was a whole lotta endive on that pizza! It was good but not as satisfying as the Bolognese. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Any place where I can plop down my lap top and have pizza has my business. Sold. Coming back! The pastas looked good too..."}
{"text":"Since moving into the neighbourhood oh 2 1/2yrs ago I had been dying to try out all you can eat Gnocchi night.

There are several flavors I can probably list them all but I'll leave that for you to discover.

What I will say is that you have to book a time slot
5-7pm
7-9pm
9-11pm

My suggestion is that you really pase yourself so that you are able to try everything and enjoy it. We were all stuffed after one hour of taste tests.

But it was a great experience.


Their Margarita pizza is really good. Crust is very thin and I don't usually eat pizza crust but without even realizing it I ate it all.

I'll be back but maybe a while for Gnocchi night:)"}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta were both terrible. We went there for lunch. I ordered FUSILLI ALLA PUTTANESCA. The tuna was so oily and the quality was very bad. My friend ordered ORTOMISTO pizza. It seemed that they had just put some vegetables and tomatoes on top of the pizza bread without baking them a little bit with the pizza.
Overall, they are many other italian restaurants in the area with the same price but better quality. I don't recommend anyone to eat there."}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat gnocchi night. I didn't, however, have any gnocchi.

I did try a pizza, the Ortomisto, that had \"little mozerella\", goats cheese, grilled vegetables and cherry tomatoes.

The pizza had too much cheese! I had to scrap some of it off. The cheese amount was more like a fast food style pizza. 

The rest of the pizza was absolutely incredible though. It was HUGE and had delicious paper thin crust, probably the thinnest crust pizza I've ever eaten. 

I would definitely go back and order the same thing and just ask the waiter that less cheese be put on top.

My friends had the AYCE gnocchi. I couldn't believe how many different kinds there were, probably 8-9 different ones. The servers wander the room with large bowls and serve up as you please. 

The decor here is quite eccentric but cool, service was A+++. Even though it's not in my neighbourhood, I'd go back!

My pizza with a glass of wine came to $25 with tax and tip."}

{"text":"I lived right above Piola for the past year and really loved their pizza and would eat their probably every other week.  Which is why I'm sad to say that they seemed to have gone out of business!  At least, their signage is gone and their website is down.  I'll miss you Piola!"}
{"text":"Episode 1:

I almost forgot I alone can eat a whole Neapolitan pizza with a Salad and a Dessert.. as I have the Lunch Prix Fixe... So for 6 of us and 5 of them males... I should have ordered at least 6 pizzas.... but with these 3 pizzas

MARGHERITA, ALSICCIA E FUNGHI, SPARTA  Though tastes good but did leave us unsatisfied!!

Piola's pizza selection is quite good... and I love thin plate bread type pizza. Though they can be baked for a little longer without being burnt, then they would have be perfect!!

Episode 2:

All you can eat Gnoochi with 12 different sauces at $14.99... Good price if you are into gnoochi. Personally I found the gnoochi at Piola is not too good...Some are too starchy..some are chewy...some are mushy... really lack consistency!!

And after a few round... I swear I am not going to have any gnoochi again for a while...

BTW, the Sangria ($26/pitcher) is really good!! Great for sharing with your friends and the best part of the meal!! Too bad it is not a All You Can Drink Sangria Night!!

Services were excellent both times... Piola is great for groups as our server was able to give us all separate bills!!"}
{"text":"I've gotta start out by saying that I thought the service was great. In addition to that the atmosphere was pretty great as well; extremely clean and well kept restaurant area and washrooms.

Beyond that the food itself was quite good. I ordered two pizza's, Gnocci, and Spaghetti... and I could have kept going! haha. 

I would definitely recommend a visit for anyone looking for light but VERY tasty pizza with a great variety of what you can choose from on the menu.

Also when you're there, make sure to \"Check-in\" on foursquare for 10% off the bill! Pretty neat deal.

Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Piola the other night to lend moral support to a friend who had never been on a date before[1]. I showed up early to the reservation and enjoyed a seat at the bar. Piola is an airy space with a casual atmosphere, and much bigger than I expected. It wasn't very busy on a Tuesday night, but there were a few people perched at the bar beside me.

They have precisely eight cocktails on the menu, priced from $8 to $12, and with an unexpected proclivitity toward Caipirinhas and Caipiroskas (which are Caipirinhas with vodka instead of Cachaça). There were some weird options too: the Torched Cherry Pop is Disarrono, Bacardi cherry and root beer. Might be good. I also noticed a modest wine selection also and two, count 'em two, beers on draught. Mill Street Tankhouse and Organic.

Pizza and pasta dominate the card. Because we're not stupid (I assume the sign out front reading \"famosi per la pizza\" means \"we like-a to make the pizza\") everyone at the table got a pie. The waitress assured us that \"they're twelve inches, they'll fill you up\" (really that's what SHE SAID) and even this was an understatement. Three pies would have sated our quartet sufficiently. My selection was the Carbonara which is what it sounds like: panchetta, mozzarella and egg. I was hoping that the egg would be the last thing added, cracked on to the hot pie mere moments before the pizza left the kitchen, but alas it was baked into the sauce. 

No biggie. The whole wheat crust was nice and thin, and the pizzas were well made. Now with so many great pizza options in the city, it's hard to place Piola's in even the top five. But it's a solid slice, respectably priced, and they do have a lot of other interesting options on the menu. I shall return.

Obligatory Title Pun: A CRUSTWORTHY addition to the pizza scene.

Menu Readability: Century gothic. Nice descriptions on the cocktails.

Need to mention: All you can eat gnocchi every month!

What this place teaches me about myself: If my name was Pete, I would instantly change my last name to Za.

{"text":"I stopped in tonight for a quick bite, and was definitely impressed.  I like to think of myself as a pizza specialist... and their thin crust, whole wheat pizza's are primo! Bueno!

We started with the prosciutto and parmesano- and the portion size (shared between 2 people) was too large to finish...

We ordered a diovala and margarita; both pizza's were delicious, light, not overly filling and heavy/oily like some of the late night joints in the Queen West area.  

A good place to take the fam, bank on good pizza and simple food.

Also- our waiter Micho was hilarious and really on his game- great service!

Overall, I would go back.  Not the place you throw back patrone at, but perfect for a good social dinner with friends/family."}

{"text":"My friend and I went to Piola last night for the AYCE gnocchi with a bunch of Yelpers to get our gnocchi fix. My friend has never tried it and I've tried it once last summer and I wanted to get my hands on some.

We were the largest group there but the service was constantly great throughout the time I was there. As soon as we got our plates we were served gnocchi very frequently, so our plates were never empty. My friend and I only got to about 4-5 servings until we were stuffed. 

I remembered gnocchi tasting really yummy when I had some last summer at my friend's cottage. However, I thought the gnocchi's here were a bit starchy and sticky when I popped them into my mouth.

The interior of the restaurant is nice and has chairs made out of clothes! I was so amazed by the chairs and kept asking people if they were really made of clothes. 

I think I'm going to try gnocchi again but this time in Mississauga.

PS: I actually give Piola a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"I've been walking past this place for the last couple of weeks, trying to figure out when it would finally open so I could give it a go. I live next door so it is a very convenient location to fill my pizza cravings.

Tonight was opening night apparently, and it was pretty slow. They had a lot of bored looking employees pacing about. I was even asked if I worked here by staff.

Cool joint. Apparently its a franchise that started in Italy with locations all over the world. This is the first one in Canada. The chairs are made of recycled clothing or something funky. I sat at the bar and just shot the shit with the bartender and and off duty hostess, both of whom made some solid recommendations. The atmosphere was pretty chill and one of the owners greeted me and thanked me for coming.

I went with the Diavola pizza (mozarella and spicy salami) off of the recommendation from the bartender. It was tops. The mozarella was perfect, the salami just spicy enough to give you that unf, and the thin crust crisped the way I like it. The pizza came out lightning fast, like uncomfortably so. Like, I got my beer, was getting ready to take off my coat, and the pizza arrived, piping hot and fresh.

Pizza's are anywhere between $10-20 and are all 12 inch in size. I crushed mine and probably could have ate another one since it was so tasty.  They also have appetizers and pasta. Apparently they have all you can eat gnocchi on the 29th of every month. I can't imagine that's healthy for you but the gnocchi did look and smell delicious.

They also appeared to make some killer looking drinks which I'll have to come back to try, especially their varieties of caipirinhas. Not Italian, I know, but they damn sure looked good. As the saying goes...I'll be back."}
{"text":"Roaming along Queen street west on a Friday night looking for some grub when I saw the light! And by light I mean fire ... they had a huge fire pit outside so just like a fly I was attracted to it. After glancing over the menu posted out front I was sold.

From the outside it looks like a traditional pizzeria minus the fire pit but once you walk inside  the decor is pretty funky with multi-coloured lamps hanging, funky art deco chairs and drawings, and a wall made of hanging photographs down the center of resto.

We were seated towards the back of restaurant beside a wall lined with fake grass / turf? With the game being projected on the back wall.

Anyways on the food which totally hit the spot!

To start we noticed everyone ordering the bruschetta which looked pretty tasty but we decided to be a little different

Polenta bruschetta - Grilled pecorino polenta topped with roasted cherry tomatoes.
Super yummy love bruschetta & polenta so the combo of them together was sensational. I also loved the bits of breadcrumb topping the cherry tomato bruschetta mixture for added crunch plus with a hardy shaving of pecorino you can't go wrong there.

Polpettine Piola - Four beef meatballs with tomato sauce and shaved Grana Padano
Sooo juicy and flavourful they definitely know how to make a good meatball here and the rich tomato sauce to dip every morsel in was also really delicious.

Capricciosa - Mozzarella, ham, mushrooms and artichokes. 
Great combo of flavours, fresh and ample topping, super thin but crunchy crust. I have to say it was a pretty stand out pie!

And for dessert.....

Dolce & compagnia
Gelato, mascarpone cream, chocolate chips, biscuits, raisins
Like cold stone creamery with an Italian spin. Delicious creamy gelato with an assortment of toppings mixed in. Loved all the different textures from the chewy raisins to crunchy biscuits and morsels of  chocolate.

Overall a really great meal from food to service plus they give you a bottle of chili and garlic oil table side. I drizzled them on everything! I was totally tempted to put them in my purse at the end of the meal! I would definitely return here for some tasty Italian fare!"}
