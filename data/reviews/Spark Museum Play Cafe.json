{"text":"Great place for adults to relax while kids play. The membership is worth it because you also get 50% off at other children's museums. My kids enjoyed their lunch and it was reasonably priced. The employees were all very friendly and do a great job keeping the museum neat without interrupting play. We stayed 3 hours with 3 kids under 6. There was plenty to keep them busy."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to downtown Urbana. The play areas are open, stylish, and well organized. Pretty much everything little people liked to do - dress up, build, create - it's covered. Also, 5 bucks a head seems really reasonable for a one time entry. If you decided that you would even visit just once a month with one kid, the $100 annual membership would make sense."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for toddlers and kids who love to use their imaginations to play. There is enough room for adults to sit down with their children to play as well. The cost is $5 per person. (You can also buy a membership). It like a huge classroom setting of fun stations like a Pirate Ship, building train tracks station, A Puppet Show Stage with puppets, a kitchen area to make pizzas, a garden area to turn the crank and put veggies on a conveyer belt, a Lego station, reading station and some science stations, using air and scarves, music station. There is a cafe for adults, even magazines for moms and dads to read while keeping an eye on their children.  A way this place can improve is don't call a Personal Pizza a LARGE PIZZA (priced as a large for $11.49). (See photo).  Buy more food items for the play kitchen area.  We liked the pizza station with felt pieces and toppings, but had a hard time finding other types of food to play in the kitchen. At the arts and crafts table, be sure there are plenty of foam stickers in stock, we could only find a few letters.   Maybe more things for the baby dolls, like clothing, another stroller, or little baby bottles for pretend play with all those baby dolls.    TIP FOR PARENTS: Eat at home, and then come here.  There is no outside food or drink allowed except baby formula.  This museum is located inside the Lincoln Square Mall so there is free parking."}
{"text":"We had a great time here on a play date with two four year olds and a seven year old.  There were so many things to do that kept the boys' attention the whole time.  The staff was easy going and allowed the boys to be creative and have fun.  There were plenty of chairs and areas for adults to chat and keep an eye on the kids.  This was a very fun play date for adults as well as kids.  Great place!"}
