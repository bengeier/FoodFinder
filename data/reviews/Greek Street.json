{"text":"Fairly new restaurant with bold flavors, but little clientele. Hopefully this place can stay around long enough to make a name for itself and win over the locals. If walking by it is hard to tell at first if this place is legit, and actually open. Their sign is fairly small (a street sign out front), and apart from the Greek flag blue paint, there is nothing to identify this place as a restaurant.

That said - the owner is super friendly and happy to talk with those who enter his shop. When my boyfriend and I went, we thought him to be a customer as he was sitting outside drinking coffee and doing a crossword puzzle. But as soon as we went inside, he jumped up to introduce himself, and his food.

The food is great. They make everything fresh, from scratch (including their pita), and use local resources. They indicate this, and warn that they can run out of items on their menu.

I order the lamb/beef Kebap, and it was amazing. The meat was juicy and tender, and cooked just right. It was not over done (if you don't like pink meat, you will need to specify). It was served in the wrap with veggies and pine nuts which added a nice contrast in flavor and texture. My boyfriend ordered the roast pork wrap with potatoes and feta. Again the meat was tender and succulent. By the end of the meal we both had juices running down our hands.

In addition to our wraps we ordered a serving of the slaw. We were pleasantly surprised by its contents: vegetables, sesame seeds, a light dressing, and dried cranberries. The slaw was brightly colored, and fresh, the veggies had the perfect crunch.

If I lived near College Street, this place could easily become a favorite go to place. Cheap prices for the quality and quantity. You wont leave hungry."}
{"text":"Just noticed this place while looking for something for lunch as I work nearby. The service was friendly. At the time of this writing, Greek Street is still developing their menu.

I had was the \"Roast\" sandwich with beef and lamb, potatoes, onion, greens, gravy, and feta, in a pita wrap. Was $10 and delicious. Tasted very fresh and everything was properly cooked. While I was waiting, the guy at the counter offered me a free sample of (I can't remember the name) what looks like a greek version of a veggie pizza. It was very tasty and the gesture was much appreciated.

Will definitely go back for lunch in the future. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"Eating the food as I'm writing this...it's THAT good! 

I am a big lover of coleslaw, but sometimes feel guilty eating it as it's smothered in sauce. However their slaw is the best I've ever had! it's light and SO refreshing. 

The souvlaki was wrapped in a thin pita which was nice because it doesn't feel heavy! Really scrumptious, and has a slight kick at the end which was nice!

Can't wait to go back and try some of the pastries! :)"}
{"text":"I've always loved Greek food, but after eating at Greek Street I get the impression that I've never truly had authentic, quality Greek - until now. This little restaurant opened just yesterday, and we happened to be the second customers. We had the souvlaki wrap, which was tender and perfectly flavored, paired with the best coleslaw I've ever had. The ingredients were fresh and infused with delicious spices. The wrap + coleslaw was only $8.50, so so so worth it! We also met the owner, who is a very outgoing gentleman who can tell you all about Greece and its cuisine. He told us that the night before opening, he had a dream about a great new dessert. He came into the shop the next day to make it and gave us a free slice. I can't recall what it was called but it was scrumptious. The pastry was light and sweet, fruit was juicy, and sauce added a tangy finish. I would highly recommend Greek Street for an afternoon lunch. It's well worth going out of your way to eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of most greek food but this place hit it on the head, I got the chicken wrap and it was beyond amazing! The staff is super nice and the food and drinks were just off the chart. This is a \"diamond in the ruff\"on the Toronto food scene and doesn't get enough recolonization for its great food. I'm giving this place a very rare full stars!"}
