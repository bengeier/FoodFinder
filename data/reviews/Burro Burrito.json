{"text":"YUM!  The vegetarian burritos here are a go-to for my husband and I and they have never failed to impress with their deliciousness.  The large size is enough for two dinners for me (not so much for husband) and the girls are very friendly.  Love this place."}
{"text":"An authentic Mexi-Cal burrito joint, very fresh and tasty.  This place is MUCH better than Burrito Boyz or Big Fat Burrito.  Warning though: \"spicy\" here means with slices of jalapeno included!"}
{"text":"This place is busy every Mon-Fri during lunch time and there's a good reason why! The food is very fresh and tastes very authentic. Compared to any of the (many) other take-out burrito joints in the area (Burrito Boyz, Burrito Bandidos, Mucho Burrito etc.) this place has real Mexican ingredients and recipes being executed all day long - you can see the women making the meats, salas and guacamole in the store.   I give them less stars because the actual burritos are sub par. They over load them and then bake them as opposed to putting them on a flat-top or a press. I find this compromises the abilities of the tortilla and more often than not it rips.   The naked burrito, or burrito bowl however is VERY good. I prefer the chicken tinga which is shredded chicken in a chipotle/adobo type sauce. It comes on top of rice and your choice of beans (black or refried pinto), and with cheese, salsas, guacamole, sour cream, burrito sauce, and cilantro. They also serve a generous handful of tortilla chips on the side which is nice for dipping.   At around $10+tax for any item it's not very cheap but you will get a hefty portion."}
{"text":"Love it!   Best after bar-hopping food, I usually go on THURS/FRI. The food is great and theres always room to sit and eat.  Also -- The girl who works there, if you're reading this I just want to say I think you're beautiful. I always want to say something, maybe see if you're single and would be willing to come out for drinks/dinner with me one night, but I keep being a wimp! :("}
{"text":"Wow... for a place that I've been going to since before it was Burro Burrito and occupied the corner of College and Clinton (yes, that was a long while ago), I'm sad to say that this place has officially hit rock bottom.   Due to their failed business venture of \"Tapas Slider\" that was once next door (for it's short lived life), they've become increasingly more expensive and increasingly lower quality. This used to be my favourite place and everyone at our office would literally be coming here at least once a week. I have to say that after their change to \"premium\" meats that I noticed for the first time the other day, it is no longer worth it. I get that they probably lost a bunch of money, but you're killing your regulars by constantly changing the price and adding new \"stipulations\" to every aspect of the order.   We came back time and time again even after the staff would tell us \"that costs extra\" for literally EVERYTHING (\"for instance, can I have a bit more lettuce? - no, costs extra\"). The problem is that their regular is almost the perfect size, but the large is MASSIVE and unnecessary.    It's official that you have alienated an office full of regulars (60 people in our office) who I think have finally decided that you're just no longer worth it. We literally have to walk past Burrito Boys which is practically next door to us in order to get to Burro and you've finally made it not worth the extra trip.   Burro, your chips are fantastic - but it's annoying that it went from a good size full container of them with a naked burrito, to hardly any at all now. Your ingredients used to be plentiful - but now you hardly have any and literally nickle and dime your regulars for absolutely everything. Your value used to be incredible - but now it's either a super expensive \"regular\" or a barely more expensive large that obnoxiously large and unnecessary.   Since you've had the \"Tips are Sexy\" sign for over a decade, I'll give you one final one. Don't alienate your regulars and make them feel like you're constantly trying to nickle and dime them or Burro will end up like Tapas and you'll be shutting the doors of another failed restaurant."}
{"text":"Really really great. Authentic and bad ass. No BS fancy boxes or menu. It's just good honest mexican food.  Burritos are not really the focus here. Tacos and chips are really very good.  Prices are reasonable and service is friendly and fast.  My new favourite lunch spot."}
{"text":"As a long-time fan of this place, I want to perform double-duty with this review.  #1: I just want to remind you that this a great place to get a tasty and (legitimately) spicy burrito. I love it.   Before a movie at Scotiabank . . . after . . . whatever. I'm not a club guy so I can't comment on what I might binge eat after a night of alcohol BUT I hope I would have the good grace to channel whatever function I had left into something from Burro Burrito.  #2 To address the person complaining about $15 burritos . . . these things are huge. Yes, you can get a filling meal for less than that but it's not quite so easy to get a filling meal of actual food (I'm talking tons of meat and veg) for that price. Just be glad these guys are anywhere near the club district and still serving up flavour.  Good day, sir.  I believe I said good day!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Burro Burrito for a long time now, after awhile I've recently felt like it's just gone down in quality. Food is very salty, prices have increased, and portions are smaller, they offer 2 sizes but the amount they give for a large is not that much more compared to the regular size, does not justify the $14+ (without a drink) spent there which is way too expensive for lunch at a \"somewhat fast food place\". Overall just disappointed."}
{"text":"Space:  It's a bit tight inside, but not too cramped.  It seemed a bit dusty, or perhaps just 'unkempt'.  The outside is a bit of an eyesore among the more low-key storefronts along College.  A large yellow facade meant to invoke Mexico.    Service:  Good service.  Friendly and helpful.  Food:  I got a Regular Steak Burrito.  Unlike Burrito Boyz, the toppings are not separated for you to choose -- rather, the peppers and tomatoes and onions are together in a Pico de Gallo, and the corn and beans (and more onions) are together as well.  As an avid hater of onions, this was displeasing.  However, even with less on it than I got at Burrito Boyz, it was better tasting.  The guacamole tasted fresh and the rice had flavour.  The burrito was wrapped tight and survived the skateboard ride home intact and still hot.  Rating:  Three Stars, if only because of lack of separated ingredient variety.  It was very tasty, and if not for my onion-hate, would have been a high four star.  If you like/don't mind onions, you will likely have a much better time.  I recommend."}
{"text":"The food tastes good. It's just bad value. It costs 15 for a burrito, chips, some guac and a drink. The thing that is annoying is that the amount of food you get every time is different. It used to be a lot of food but now they're giving out smaller burritos, less chips."}
{"text":"Can't say I've tried many burrito places but I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was and good prices."}
{"text":"I compare all burritos I eat to those from Burro.  And let me tell you, nothings stacks up.  Burro is amazing. I always get bean and cheese as I'm a vegetarian but don't love soy meat.   Their guac is always fresh and plentiful. They heat it so the cheese is melted and the whole thing is actually warm (I hate when the outside is hot and burnt and the inside is cold. ew). And the large is as big as my arm!  Please go here. Please tip them. And please decide what you want before you stand infront of me in line. Because I will get bitchy."}
{"text":"All I wanna say is: HALIBUT BURRITO. Took me a while to try the Halibut as I was very skeptical about it. However, since I've had it, I don't even care for all the other burritos ;) Try it out yourself. Already convinced many of my friends. :)"}
{"text":"Dear NAFTA,  Thank you.  When I bite into a Burro Burrito, I forget about global warming and the moral dilemma of bottled water. The world begins to make sense... I start to picture my first love, Monique, and the way she smiled at me across the playground. This euphoric carrot chase lasts for about 47 seconds while I devour my cherished \"Loaf of Love\" (I feel burrito is too harsh of a word for such a display of artistic brilliance).  If Little Italy isn't your local haunt, try their Mole Burrito pronounced \"Mole'eH!\" (locals know). Don't worry, if you ever played flip cup, you can order for your friends.   Just promise me you won't be fooled by the lackluster interior and blinding signage, this isn't a nail salon turned eatery, think of it more as a gift from the Mexican Queen of Awesome Burritos.  Sincerely yours,"}
{"text":"Ironically enough, the best go to meal in Little Italy is Burro Burrito. I have been more times than I can count and I always get the same thing - steak salad with the incredibly zesty lime vinegarette. It is consistently fresh and the flavour is so authentic. Make sure you go with your appetite because $10 buys you a meal and a half!"}
{"text":"Burro Burrito makes great tasting burritos.  All the ingredients are high quality and fresh, and there is a good assortment.  The burritos are stuffed full, and then well baked.  The location is small, seating only for a few people, and no bathroom for the customers, so it's mainly a take-out place, which is fine for me."}
{"text":"Toronto has some fine burrito joints, but burro has to be the best.   Super fresh and ultra tasty.  This placebis for the burrito lover."}
{"text":"\"Real mole tacos in Toronto?\", I said, deeply skeptical. Seven years of frequent travel to California have killed my ability to eat poor imitations of Mexican food. However, my desire for tacos outweighed my skepticism and off I went.  The result? Four delightfully sloppy and delicious mole tacos, and numerous repeat visits. The staff are solid, the options are good, and turnaround is quick. The main downside is the price is a little high for tacos, but I'll live with it because, well, I love tacos."}
{"text":"If you want real tacos, nachos, burritos, enchiladas and more than this is the place to be! Such a fresh taste! Food was amazing, I got the taco and nacho chips combo. The guacamole that came with the tacos and chips was the best tasting thing I ever had! Please go here!!! Food was really good :)"}
{"text":"I love burritos but I've had a lot of boring ones in Toronto. I go to Burro when I want proper flavour, actually spicy, and a respectable scoop of cheese... So, always. Toppings are v solid and I'm hooked on the steak. Have never had to wait in a line more than a couple minutes and the people who work there are great.  First time there, I thought $9 was a lot for lunch. But it bought me like half an hour of blissful eating and nearly a day of full body satisfaction so I figure I got my money's worth  Haven't had their other things but honestly just get a burrito it will make you happy"}
{"text":"So, gonna vent...why alienate your customer for a few lousy dollars? That is the question I pose to you, Burro Burrito. Last time I checked Avocados were a $1 a piece (give or take $.50), so why, when I spend $3.99 (plus tax), for what I believe was a 'side' of guacamole, with the expectation of it being at least a full half or even a full avocado, do I receive what I can best describe as a 'shot' glass sized serving. Really? Really?   Your food is good, I like it, I like the selection, the freshness and the serving size is very respectable; like an American sized snack (joke), it's massive, still feel weighed down and having a hard time typing/concentrating. Why ruin my experience, and annoy me over something so mundane?   Here is your reward.  Burro - go eat there, it's not bad. Just don't order their damn guacamole, as you will likely be as disappointed as I was. Sometimes reviews are not about the food right? Sometimes it's about the experience.   My experience left me to write this...I feel full inside, yet so hollow..."}
{"text":"Been here half a dozen times with and without my girlfriend and every time it has been excellent.  Well priced, fresh ingredients, fast service and large portions.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I'm by no means a Mexican food expert, but I have been cravin' the Burrito I had at Burro Burrito for DAYS!   Ordered the Shrimp Burrito (with everything on it) and am salivating while I write this. Perfectly wrapped, wonderfully fresh, and deliciously spicy. The hot sauce is something to write home about.  We arrived late on a Friday night, received prompt service, and incredible food.   The only issue: the renter that lives above, was ashing her cigarette on our table. Not the fault of Burro Burrito, and we were good sports about it :) C'mon! You must know that you live above a restaurant patio. Purchase an ashtray!   I CAN NOT WAIT to return and eat another insanely delicious Shrimp Burrito. Guac was amazing too.   Thanks, Guys!"}
{"text":"Better tasting and more authentic than most places in the city, with the exception of maybe Chipotle. There's no burrito toasting going on here, which is nice to see. Service is quick and efficient and they try their best to get your burrito customized to your wants.  The pico de gallo is fresh and tasty. The tinga and mole chicken are both excellent and selection is great overall. They also have the \"naked\" (no tortilla) option for low carb eaters. Guac is included with your burrito unlike certain other places. The naked burrito also comes with chips, which is awesome. Now we just need a salsa table..."}
{"text":"The fish burrito is awesome so it the mole. My go to place for traditional tacos and burritos and the portions are massive!"}
{"text":"I like their bean burritos. They're not as good as the gold standard (Burrito Boyz) but are about on par with Mucho Burrito (save for the lack of tables - just bar seats). It good for a quick lunch on a work day."}
{"text":"Burro Burrito has changed their menu and although it is easier to understand, it has decreased value and options.   No more size options - there is only the large priced burrito at the regular size. Little bit of a rip off, there. The oven was also broken when I last went, so it was heated on a hot-plate which left the tortilla soft and chewy, sort of gross.   $9.80 for all mains (tacos, quesadillas , burritos). A little much."}
{"text":"This will be probably from now on my favourite Mexican food place !!, they had open recently close to my home and I couldn't be happier since we where lacking of options to eat . Burro burrito came to wake up my up from the dull food with there spice and flavour !! Try the \" tinga \" burrito in a bowl with crispy  chips and fresh guac , it really hits the spot !!!"}
{"text":"Pretty new place - seems a little on the basic side (some additional deco would make it more attractive.. Mexican artists dream, new canvas to paint).  Cheap and fast Mex food! Friendly staff - would recommend! Love the spice level, I was warned jaja so good!"}
{"text":"Ok let me set the record straight on burro.  I visited here today because of the good reviews on this place and all I can say is:  Are you kidding me?  It was absolutely disgusting.  I had the nachos with half mole chicken and half beef.  Ok let's break it down.  The Nachos were seeped in oil.  And if you are wondering if they make you fresh nachos.  The answer is no they don't.  On top of that they put corn which was just a heavy filler to me.  On top of that they put the meat which was salty with no particular flavour to entice me.  Then they put cheese on top of it and stuck  it in the oven.  They serve it with guac, pico de gaillo, mashed beans, sour cream and a sauce that tasted like smashed avocado lime and something hot.  They were all bland and heavy.  When I sat down to eat I taste tested the meats.  I didn't like it so I scraped it off.  It was just all a disaster.  And the service was not inviting."}
{"text":"You will NOT be hungry after these tasty and HUGE burritos.  Super friendly staff, fresh ingredients along with interesting variety of meat fillings make Burro a great option if you are craving Mission-style burritos."}
{"text":"Working across the street at 401 Richmond, this place was a diet staple for well over two years. It`s a solid joint. Some things have changed for the worse since they opened (#1. eliminated the `small`option, #2. portions have gotten smaller on the large option eroding value and #3. you can't order 'small chips' anymore), but it's still one of the best Mexican places in Toronto. Mostly take-out although some renovations have made a bit more eat-in space possible.  Very fresh, quality ingredients, very well seasoned meat options, great fish/shrimp, and efficient extremely friendly staff. Waaaay better than burrito bandidos and a lot more authentic.  Steak or shrimp tacos, chicken mole burrito or fish salad are the tops. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Friday night and ordered 2 chicken tacos and 1 fish taco. The tacos themselves weren't heated up adequately and the chicken and fish were basically room temperature. The tacos were also soft and soggy. The tilapia tasted like dirt. I am never going here again."}
{"text":"i've pretty much tried every burrito in Toronto (mostly bean and chicken)  Burro beats them all. Authentic, very very tasty burritos. Lower on the price range (compared to big fat, boyz, etc.) Always fast service (although I've never been in their during a late bar rush) but who cares.... point is: BEST BURRITOS.  No washroom and effed up layout though. Weird."}
{"text":"Healthy portions, fresh food and friendly quick service.  Corn chips are delicious and the guacamole freshly made.  Slow cooked meats are melt in the mouth.  Authentic Mexican at affordable prices."}
{"text":"I just began working in the area and wanted to try this place as it was close by. I decided to order the quesadillas. They were definitely good but I thought the price was a bit expensive. I ordered a small and it cost me just under $10 and didn't even include a drink or the small bag of chips they give as a side. I think I may have also been overcharged because the man in front of me ordered a large burrito and the cashier confused our orders so he ended up paying less than me and getting more. The cashier acknowledged the mistake but never gave me my money back. I would have been happy if she'd even just given me one of the small bags of chips for the mistake. Despite these few disappointments, the food did taste great and I really like the fact that they give you a cup of guacamole with your order. I'm sure I will be back at some point, but I don't think this will be my go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice this week. The vegetarian burrito (bean and cheese) is delicious. Like other reviews have stated, the ingredients are super fresh and I like the oven technique compared with other places in Toronto.  My only criticism would be on price. Bean and cheese burritos are typically at least a dollar cheaper than meat options, but here they're the same."}
{"text":"Dear Burrito Boys, Chipotle, Burrito bandido etc. etc.: Eat your heart out. Burro Burrito is the best in the city. I don't think you can compare the taste, service and the right variety of toppings available.   I've eaten here a few times now and have been so satisfied each and every time.  First time I've seen Conchita pulled pork as a burrito option and boy is it good. Slow cooked for hours in a citrus BBQ sauce, mm mm. Also, they wrap that burrito tighter than you can imagine - maximum taste, minimum waste (mess).  A comment about the music is necessary, it's a bit odd. Couldn't help but feel I was in high school again when I heard 50 Cent's Candy Shop and his reminder that we can lick the lollipop. Thanks, 50.  Honourable Mentions: - Reasonably priced: hearty meat burrito for $7.50 - Burro Burritos are baked for 2 minutes minimizing sogginess even when taken to-go"}
{"text":"Recently opened in the Entertainment District, I was reluctant to try the joint as I didn't think this area needed another Burrito place but alas, I was craving a Quesadilla. The ladies working behind the counter were pleasant and very quick to take my order. The menu itself is pretty extensive and very reasonably priced. The food looked very fresh.  As for the meal itself, it was good. Not the best but pretty good.  I had the ground beef Quesadilla. It was a bit too salty for my liking (and I like salty). The hot sauce and the Guacamole were really delicious.   The Décor is simple and I think it's still working out the details but sometimes less is more and this seems to be the case.   Definitely a great addition to my work area, I think next time I'm trying the tacos! (Stay tuned for the updated review!)"}
{"text":"Love this place to death. The food is extremely fresh, the owner always there, smiling. Amazing service from the entire staff.  Chicken-amazing, ground beef-ridiculously good! Sauces are very good and unique to them.  Rice, beans, a stellar.  I love the easy-going patio where you can quickly sit and munch if you're on the go."}
{"text":"I came to this place and ordered chicken tacos. The girl serving me was completely bitchy not to mention the fact that I felt like I overpaid what I ordered. I've tried their other location on College and I found a better experience there. Sadly the richmond location I'll never return. Service was HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Fresh, flavourful, enormous servings (easily make a burrito two meals), clean environs, friendly staff - all so good.  Smallish patio right on the college sidewalk, but there is a renovation underway, so the exterior and interior might be kicked up a notch."}
{"text":"Always like Mexican food. Most Mexican places Ive been to has been good. The food was good but not as good as what I'm used too. We had the shrimp and the steak burritos. The shrimps had too much liquid, made burrito soggy and hard to eat.   An the place wasn't kept neat and clean. Probably would not come back again unless I have too."}
{"text":"This place runs out of ingredients - a lot.   What is the point of walking here when they are out of fish, shrimp, guacamole so often?  Next time I will go to Burrito Boyz, who are so much more professionally managed.  In the summer, this place is not air conditioned (although either is the College Burrito Boyz), and it gets sweltering hot in there.   Not sure why their management doesn't throw a few thousand $$ into an air conditioner, if for no other reason than workplace safety for their employees.  I used to like this place, but I'm over that now."}
{"text":"In an attempt stall the rate at which my friends and I were becoming intoxicated, we decided to fill up on some food. Tacos seemed to be the clear winner that night. We walked in and the place was pretty empty. The burritos seem to be the star at this place, but we opted for the tacos and nachos.  Tacos: one order of chicken and one of steak. (My friend from the UK thought that all tacos came in a hard shell like they do at Taco Bell. When the girl at the counter pulled out a corn tortilla, she was not happy. The girls at the counter thought this was hilarious. I'll never tell my friend what they muttered in Spanish HAHA) I didn't eat the steak tacos, but I had the chicken. There's 4 tacos per order. They're small, but loaded, so I was pretty full after 2 tacos. Good balance of meat and veggies and other add-ins, so I was pleased. Seasoning on the chicken was good as well. Could have used a bit more cheese, but that's probably just me.  Nachos: Soooooo meh. They weren't anything special. Again, it could have used more cheese, but that's probably just me.   The biggest plus about this place: The outdoor seating area which featured two tables, atop a little area of turf. This really enhanced the feel of the place, and we gave Burro free publicity by sharing our tacos with the attractive men that happened be passing by. Needless to say, they enjoyed the tacos too."}
{"text":"Their bean and cheese burrito hits the spot. I happily devoured it and wondered why I don't come here more often. (Actually, I know why: I'd rather gamble on Mission Burrito being open and get their sweet potato number instead.) Burro's creamy sauce they squirt on at the end of assembly adds a delicious je ne sais quoi. Really, je ne sais what that sauce is but it's very tasty. Good, freshly made quac in the burrito too. Minor complaints: The large burrito isn't especially large so a bigger human might not be as sated as I was. Also, they were miserly with the pico de gallo. And I would love to see a sweet potato burrito added to their menu! I would go to Burro exclusively if they had that."}
{"text":"If you guys delivered or worked with uber eats, door dash, just eat, foodora. You would make a killing. This is the only burrito place I love and your never open when the bars close. You're just never open. Most tastiest and most hard to get"}
{"text":"Not the best burrito's I've ever had, but not the worst.  I ordered the standard beef and cheese burrito from this small, simple no frills type of place that seems to have locals lining up for a quick meal.  I can appreciate that their ingredients are fresh and the food doesn't lack quality, just a little flavour.    I was impressed by the size of the burrito, I mean, this thing was completely packed and by the time I was done, my food baby had gained a couple pounds.    My suggestion is to order this take out, bring it home and spice it up a little with your own seasonings.  What you get here is a great base burrito with good ingredients, just need a little more for that wow factor."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place last week but have already been 3 times.  The food is very good here. You can tell that all the ingredients are fresh and high quality. So far I've tried the steak, chorizo and pulled pork and they're all juicy and flavourful.  The staff are also super friendly. It's a damn pleasure to come here.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite fast food Mexican spot in the city. I almost always get their black bean salad and they never disappoint. Their hot sauce is a MUST if you like spicy foods. If you're feeling hungry, go with the quesadillas, they're a hefty portion."}
{"text":"I'm pretty obsessed with Burro Burrito. Their burrito bowls + salads are large and pretty reasonably priced for how much comes in it.  The staff are super friendly and are really quick to serve. Come quickly though, because the lunch rush can sometimes get pretty heavy.   My only complaint would be that they don't use freshly chopped jalapenos instead, they offer seasoned peppers. If you're looking for something super spicy, definitely ask to jack up the hot sauce or pile on extra peppers."}
{"text":"It's a little bit pricy. ( 13 dollar after tax without a drink. ) but with great taste. Their hot pepper is awesome. If you like something spicy, try it."}
{"text":"When you stack up Burro Burrito against the \"bigger\" burrito joints in this city, it ranks low. I'm only judging by the quality of the burrito this review and not the location.  I like my burritos less mushy, so less beanie... and not soggy, so more time on the grill to form that crispy crust enclosure. Burro doesn't produce these results but I don't think they planned on doing so. What you get is a softer, not crispy, tortilla wrap.  The fillings range from pork to chicken to steak, to fish. I've tried their chorizo with potato, steak, and shredded pork before. The flavours of each protein are similar once you eat them along with all the ingredients anyway, so it's a texture thing you should care for. I prefer the steak, but I always prefer steak for any meal... so that doesn't help.  The burrito: slightly toasted flour tortilla filled with rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, unidentifiable (but tasty) sauce with your choice of meat. One word of warning, their levels of hot are out of control. Dial it one notch down to that you're used to ordering because they seem to be ruthless here... or authentic, one or the other.  Mild is always good.  Overall, it's a great place for that late night craving or after a sloshed night. If you want a drier, less expensive and crispier burrito, I suggest Burrito Boyz which is three blocks east of Burro. At least if you forget while in your drunken daze, Burrito Boyz won't render your mouth unusable from a simple choice between mild, medium, or hot."}
{"text":"Look out Burrito Boyz! You've finally got some competition. Got the Chicken Breast (Tinga) burrito on a basil tomato wrap with everything (including jalapenos) on it. Hands down the best burrito that I've had in a while; the meat and veggies were tasty, the guac was just right, and the burrito itself was toasted to perfection. It was spicy though so be careful. They do not have options for burrito sizes. Mine came to $11 so a bit on the pricey side.  Although this location is out of the way for me, I'm sure that I will visit their College location in the near future."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time last week, and came back today for lunch. Prices are good and the ingredients and flavor better than fat bastard burrito.  The staff is super friendly! I had a Soy Burrito, with guacamole and I'll definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Ok, so yes, the burrito was fine. The chicken tinga was good, but there were small noodles throughout the burrito (I assume they were in the chicken mixture), which was a little off-putting.  The most galling thing, though, is the price. I paid $12.80 for a Chipotle-sized burrito, and that's with NO extras. That's just the frigging price for a basic burrito.   They were out of mole, the whole reason I went there, which sucked.   After charging me $12.80, when I reminded the cashier I'd asked for sour cream on the side, she informed me it was an extra charge. Are you serious? A tub of sour cream costs frickin' $1.99 at the grocery store, you just robbed me blind for a basic burrito, and now you're gonna have me pay more? I flat out refused and I think she could tell I was fixing for a fight because she backed off.   Bottom line: If the burrito was $7, which it should be, I might go back. But if you're asking me to pay $13, it better be the best damn burrito I've ever had, which this definitely wasn't."}
{"text":"Burro Burrito is certainly one of the tastiest burritos I have had in this city. I frequent all the stops around town, Big Fat Burrito, Burrito Banditos, Fat Bastard Burrito, Burrito Boyz and more. Of all the places I have been I's place the chicken burrito here in my top two. I happily paid more for fresh and tasty ingredients and burrito so large I couldn't finish it without help from a friend. I highly recommend this place to anyone searching for a tasty, quick, filling meal in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite burrito places in all of Toronto. The ingredients are very authentic and fresh, the choices are very numerous (Multiple styles of meat, fish and tofu options), great size for the burritos and probably the best guacamole in town! I highly recommend the chicken mole as it is WONDERFULLY delicious!  Also bit of warning: Their hot sauce is HOT so make sure you have the stomach for it!"}
{"text":"A true gem. Get the naked burrito with chips. Mole chicken is a winner here. Generous portions and friendly service round out the delicious food."}
{"text":"Color me impressed -- a good burrito in Toronto! Granted, it's nowhere near as great as one you'd get in the Mission in San Francisco, or in San Diego. But this is as good as it's going to get for a burrito in the Great White North. I stopped in and got a rice and bean burrito to go, and it was delightfully stuffed with all sorts of deliciousness. Plus, the girl who works there was super sweet and friendly. And they have horchata.   Muy sabroso. Burro Burrito gets five sombreros!"}
{"text":"Not my fave burrito place but it's not bad. The burritos are extremely large and difficult to eat, but the toppings are pretty good."}
{"text":"I tried their tacos and in retrospect that might have been my first mistake.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but when a store has Burrito in the title, you should probably make a point of trying it out.    Anyway, I had their tacos and at first I was a bit excited.  All the ingredients looked fresh, and even the tortilla flats were put into an oven in front of me to warm them up.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with the final product.  The warmed up soft shell quickly turned soggy, and the insides quickly went cold.  And even the taco itself just wasn't as tasty as I'd hoped.  The store itself is like one of those sub sandwich places, where you order and they assemble it in front of you and then you can carry it to a table.  The woman who attended me  was very nice."}
{"text":"I found the real Mexican flavor on Toronto!!! The most delicious food, they have really good quality, I love it"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the naked burrito.... Chicken. Seems to be a big difference between the small and large sizes. The large size is likely worth the extra $."}
{"text":"Strolling for some food along College Street my buddy and I came across Burro Burrito.  A small shop kept clean and presentable has been here for appropriately 8 years. With a great selection and small appetite I ordered their Small burrito (which wasn't so small lol) Packed with Rice and beans, chorizo, mild, guacamole, tomatoes, medium sauce this was a delightful bite!  For a small burrito, it's we'll packed, with a melody of Mexican inspired ingredients  Overall the Ambiance is colorful, small with limited indoor seating but we took advantage of their outdoor seating. If I'm ever in this neck of the woods, with a craving for burritos, I'll be sure to stop by and try their other menu options.  Adios!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mission Burrito, Burrito Banditos, Burrito Boyz, BarBurrito, and Big Fat Burrito in search of a burrito as good as the ones at Chipotle - I was hoping to find a cheaper and more local alternative without comprimising in taste. Well Burro Burrito is that and more - absolutely incredible burritos here with great service and cheaper prices than Chipotle ($2.00 for guac - are you kidding me???). I got the pulled pork burrito with both the refried and black beans and loved every minute of it. I also tried my friends mole chicken and chicken burritos and they were both fantastic as well. I live 5 minutes from the downtown Chipotle but I'll be making the trek to Burro Burrito from now on. I think it's the fresh salsa and corn that do it for me."}
{"text":"I do have to agree with some of the reviews here that it is pricey.  Almost $10 for a small burrito with no sides (not even salsa).  The burrito itself was okay.  The only difference here is that they heat it before serving. I also saw people ordering 3 small tacos, although I couldn't see where that item was on the menu (secret menu?).  The inside is very bare except for a carpet hung on the wall that says \"Mexico\".  Save yourself a couple of bucks and walk over to Wilbur's on King where the portions are larger, with free chips and salsa withh 60 hot sauces to choose from - and cheaper too.  3 stars are for friendly staff and okay food.  Average."}
{"text":"Chocolate / Chicken / Burrito lovers: the Mole burrito is a must try.  If the large doesn't fill your stomach, you've got a tape worm.  Service is friendly, but be prepared for low maintenance. Using your arm to knock a bunch of junk off the table is in full effect, if they're busy.  BONUS: Open late and 1000x less sketchy than Burrito Boyz after a night out."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I swear I did. But what a huge letdown!  When you see lineups out the door you hope/pray/expect that you've come to the right place. Not for me at least. The bowl is fairly standard but for $12.xx its a ripoff. yes they give include guac but still portion wise even Chipotle does better.  The main reason for my minus 3 stars is the salt. My soy-vegetarian option was so salty i wanted to lick a napkin after every bite! I'm so sad. I thought ta-da! authentic mexican within 2 minutes of walking? what more can I ask for...I smh in disappointment.  I'm afraid to try again & end up finding extra salt in my food againt..not sure if I'll be back to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Good solid burritos. Mole Chicken was nice and they have 2 veg burritos I think. Not amazing, but still tasty"}
{"text":"Best burritos downtown. Super fresh, authentic Mexican cuisine right at Richmond and Spadina.   It gets super busy around lunch but they've managed an efficient production line to keep up with the lunch rush.   The naked burrito is pretty amazing and comes with the standard: rice, refried beans, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, corn, pickled relish, jalapenos and guacamole at no extra charge!   I would recommend the regular chicken and the chicken tinga. I'm sure I'll be back to try out the tacos and beef!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of burritos, BUT this one is something else. by far, BEST burrito in town. and the two friendly ladies working there made the experience even better."}
{"text":"Very tasty burrito..I had the soy on whole wheat..just the right size and very flavourful"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good! The food was tasty, and there were lots of filling options using high-quality ingredients. I'd say that the food is a little pricey for what you get though (which is why I am giving 3 instead of 4 stars).  They have a toaster which crisps up the tortilla about 100x faster than Burrito Boyz. I appreciate this, because sometimes I'm not in the mood to wait like 15 minutes to have my burrito grilled."}
{"text":"One of the best Burrito places downtown. I have been coming here for some time, usually order Burrito (best bang for your buck).  Friends have ordered Nachos and tacos and had no complaints  Food: I ordered pulled pork burrito.  They are very generous with adding all the ingredients, pulled pork, guacamole... The burrito in the end up being really heavy. The cost was just over 10$ with tax.  Locale:  The location is small, they have a 1 table and a bar with 4-5 chairs.  I would not recommend this place for people who want to sit down, or are coming in a large group of people.   Really good for: a quick lunch or late night."}
{"text":"Higher end burrito place. These are cheaper burritos, but they are well done.  They have a high selection of proteins, including things like chicken mole.Guac comes including with all the burritos. And the most exciting thing is the burrito isn't just pressed but put under a salamander and it gets a nice crust to it. To be honest, even the rice looks of high quality. And all the people working there seem to be of latin decent, so you can trust that they know what they are doing... it sure tastes like it."}
{"text":"One weekday lunch hour, my workgroup decided to order from this restaurant.  The place was not busy compared to the Spadina/Richmond location as my colleague pointed out, therefore ordering was quick.  The dining area was colorful, well-lit and looked clean and probably can seat twenty.  Each of my colleagues wanted burritos, I also wanted a burrito but before I ordered I was attracted to the four tacos another customer ordered.  The ingredients looked very fresh.  The meats looked well seasoned and delicious.  I had to stop myself from jumping over the counter to try out the ingredients, they looked that fresh!  The ladies behind the counter were very helpful, insightful and patient, one of them sounded like the owner.    After five minutes of having our food assembled, I hurried back to the office so we can enjoy these masterpieces.  Not only did the ingredients looked fresh, they tasted fresh as well.  The meats were well-seasoned and juicy.  All of us ordered medium spicy but found the heat to be lacking so for all you heat-lovers go a few notches up.  The burritos felt heavy and some of my colleagues feared that they will be comatose after consuming such heavy meals but they did not because most of the ingredients were veggies.    Overall, my workgroup order again but this time we will all go and sit in the dining area on a nice day to really enjoy our lunch hour."}
{"text":"Wowza. This must be the best burrito I have tried in a long, long time.  I had the juicy and delicious chipotle chicken burrito, and lemme tell ya - it was worth every single cent. Sure, their prices may be a bit higher than the competition, but boy is it worth it.  The interior is rather charming, I thought. Feels like an authentic place, rather than a poshed up chain like Chipotle (not that I mind Chipotle, but the interior difference is quite striking). The service was very friendly when I was there and she took her time to explain things and answer questions. It was not the cleanest of spaces, but honestly, just the cool vibe and the ridiculously delicious burrito made a whole world of difference.   Cannot wait to go back there again! YUM!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks, I think my previous review may have been written out of sheer burrito inexperience! The burritos here are pretty damn delicious, and are better than Chipotle's (though, Chipotle serves up delicious goodness as well), and I can't get over how fresh the fish is. The fish is never cooked from frozen. The Mexican rice is savoury. For a connoisseur of spice such as myself, the spice level is bomb! The guac is ridiculously fresh. The burrito sauce is calorie laden heaven. The Mexican hospitality is also quite nice. Go for the Fish Burritos, and you will keep going back. Also, don't forget the Jarrito with your Burrito!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Burro Burrito.  I love burritos and haven't had one there.  I ordered a large chicken burrito on a whole wheat wrap with rice, beans, cheese, tomatoes, corn and burrito sauce.  It came to $15 with a Diet Pepsi.  They heat the wrap up, then put in the ingredients and then put it in an oven for about a minute and a half.  The burrito was just okay, not great.  There was lots of filling but not a lot of chicken ... it was supposed to be \"white meat\" but it was hard to tell because there was some kind of spicing on it (TexMex maybe?).  I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"This place is a decent contender in the Tex Mex QSR space, between ample seating, a bright well designed space and simplified menu that allows for quick selection and service this is a great place. Seats are flimsy plastic so if you're a heavier person you might want to get yours to go.  Pricing and process are an issue here, I echo some earlier concerns regarding the price hike for either a very small burrito or a regular sized burrito (now claimed to be large). What's being offered really doesn't justify the increase in costs, The ingredients were fresh and the place was clean which is more than I can say for fat bastard burrito, Additionally, they barely grill the burrito to seal it, so you may have large soggy sections of your burrito after 10 minutes or if you fill it with everything.  Aside from some minor gripes the food was good, so I can't complain too much. Would have rated higher, but 1 star less for high prices and soggy burritos is fair."}
{"text":"Try their salads they are amazing. I would recommend the pulled pork or Tonga chicken but they all are amazing.  The restaurant gives you free guac and dip with each salad turning them into an extremely tasty nacho dish.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I come here once per week AT LEAST for lunch since I work in the hood. I was a regular at Burrito Bandito until this place opened.  I find it more authentic both in food and the staff (who are all Mexican women speaking Spanish).  Until recently they had a regular size and large size burrito ($7.50 and $9.50 respectively) but have now eliminated the regular.  The large really is too big for the average person so at first I was a bit put off, but now I just eat half at lunch and save the rest for dinner!  All ingredients are fresh fresh fresh!   Their tacos are also great, as is the homemade Guac!  I find their homemade tortilla chips a little over cooked but still tasty for sure!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from burro and ashamedly admit to eating here far too often. I've never been let down with the quality of the food. For a fast-food joint the ingredients are surprisingly fresh and tasty. The burritos are awesome. They have loads of options including several veggie friendly versions (the veggie ground round is delicious). The salads are also amazing and are served with (what tastes like) fresh tortilla chips and a heap of guacamole. Can't go wrong with that. There's also tacos and quesadillas on the menu! YUM ! What's great about Burro is the ingredients are more traditional then many other burrito places. Your food isn't covered in cheese, but rather is full of bursting fresh flavors from housemade salsas  and guac. As a non-cilantro lover I find most items still tasty... but don't get me wrong if you love cilantro there's an option to slather it on.  All in all the staff are lovely and friendly. For a 10$ or less / meal Burro is fabulous, you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Rip off!  Alright, I admit, I made a bad choice getting the tacos. That being said, for about $10 I got 4 tiny little tacos that were okay tasting. And by little tacos, I mean....tiny. I'm a big guy! I was still hungry after!"}
{"text":"Very good spicy chicken burrito! Tasty toppings too! VERY SPICY SAUCE mmmmm  Seems a little expensive for a chicken burrito compared to Mucho Burrito and Much Burrito gives a lot more topping selections and a much bigger large burrito.  This \"large\" one looks like the \"small\" burrito you would get at Mucho.   My overall rating would have to be 3 but the food itself is a 4."}
{"text":"Dare I say they make the best burritos in the city?! Never skimpy on ingredients and guac isn't an extra charge - amen! All the kinds are good although I like the steak and the veggie beef. Sometimes the meat can be a little on the salty side but that's really the only bad thing I'd say. Warning - hot/medium is HOT!!! Burrito sauce is soooo good."}
{"text":"These are my favourite burritos in the city. I get the vegetarian (soy) burrito without dairy and I get it spicy. They don't mess around with spice - it really is hot and it really is good. The girls that work here are all really nice and I would definitely recommend this place over that other burrito place down the road..."}
{"text":"After sharing a few pitchers with friends last Saturday night, I found myself struck by a hunger that only a burrito can satiate. I lamented that we were nowhere near a Chipotle (my preferred burrito vendor), but one of my drinking buddies informed me that he knew a nearby place that was better than Chipotle. I scoffed at what I thought was a ridiculous overstatement (particularly since he was suggesting a place named after a donkey...), but asked that he lead the way regardless of my skepticism.   The decor at this unassuming establishment might not knock your socks off, but the aroma is bound to make your mouth water.  I ordered a small chicken burrito with all the fixin's - it was love at first bite. The guacamole (which they give you at no additional charge by the way - bonus!) is so fresh and flavourful. I was also shocked that I actually enjoyed the corn salsa. It adds a welcomed sweetness and delightful texture to the burrito that offsets the creamy guacamole and refried beans. The chicken meat is seasoned perfectly and I appreciated that they use dark meat as opposed to white, it really adds depth. I should also add that you're going to need a lot of napkins when you get towards the end of it. Burrito juice was cascading down my arms and all over my dress, though I really wasn't bothered by the mess I was making - I was too caught up in burrito euphoria!  I am typically a ridiculously slow eater. My dining companions always make fun of me for my inability to keep up (it could have something to do with the fact that I never shut up...but I digress...). However, when it came to this burrito? I had absolutely no difficulty staying on pace. That has honestly NEVER happened before. A food item that takes precedence over running my mouth?! Astounding!  I am very curious to try their fish burrito as well. I'll be sure to write an update when I do!"}
{"text":"I was headed to the fish stop next door after reading all of the great reviews. When I got there I realized they only accepted cash so went to burro burro instead. I am glad I did!   I had the large salad with chicken tinga and all of the toppings (corn, fresh guacamole, pico de gallo, shredded radishes, black beans and lettuce. They have a couple of different dressings you can choose from - I got the chipotle. The server then mixes all of the ingredients in a bowl and serves it into a to go container.  The meat here is fantastic. If you don't know what you want the servers will let you sample a couple of options on a chip. The chicken tinga has a really strong kick - I had to drink a few glasses of water after!  If I was in front of a chipotle and a burro burrito I would choose burro. Good work guys."}
{"text":"Overall solid place. Good food and friendly staff. They threw in a free burrito last time we were there which we thought was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"These burritos are delicious and they do NOT skimp out on the portions! Being a big fan of this location and the College Street location, I will keep going back... I've tried many a burrito joint in the GTA and they have all left me desiring, with the exception of sweet Burro... their toppings are fresh, plentiful and delicious! They have a great repertoire of selections and by far, it kicks any other take-out burrito place's a** !!  Don't rely on going here to dine-in.. they do have a small seating area with some bar stools, but it's great for take out, and the burritos are nothing shy of torpedos in size. You will be more than satisfied, and the prices are super reasonable.  I've tried the chicken tinga and the chicken mole, with mole being far superior. They give a very generous portion of meat, as compared to other burrito joints, as well as plentiful toppings, so you are guaranteed to be full. Best burrito in town in my books.."}
{"text":"Good stuff, but needs more cheese. =)  I was really happy to find a delivery burrito place for those times when we are just beat and want to stuff our faces without working too hard.  We tried another one that was only meh, but Burro Burrito was miles above it.  Their guacamole is fresh and chunky, their salsa verde is nice and tasty.  I got a Bean and Cheese burrito the size of my forearm that included rice, lettuce, guac, cheese... just about everything you could imagine in there.  My husband got some tacos.  We both ended up full and happy.  I am a cheese fiend, and could always use more cheese, but I see on their menu that they have an extra section for ordering that kind of thing.  I will know next time. =)  I'm also excited to try the fish tacos!  I'm still searching for a \"real\" california-mexican style place here in Toronto, as I haven't had a \"wet\" burrito or a cheese enchilada in far too long, but this is good in the meantime."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab some dinner last night after the gym. We were really craving Burrito Boyz but too lazy to walk a few blocks, and this was right nearby.   Food is good and fairly cheap. I ordered a \"naked\" burrito (all the burrito ingredients served inside a container, no wrap). It came with a generous portion of tortilla chips on the side.   Meals cost around $11 with tax. Portions were good.  The interior is pretty boring with only a couple tables, so best suited for take out.  Overall good place. It's not Burrito Boyz (cheaper and they cook their meats/burritos fresh to order) but it's #2 in terms of burritos!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Cooked well. Great toppings. Generous with the guac! They cook the burrito to perfection. The people who work there are all really nice."}
{"text":"This places rivals my love for Chipotle.  I had the small pork burrito which was the perfect size to fill me up and not leave me feeling bloated.  The guac, salsas, meat, and some drinks are all made in-house so they're quite authentic.  The pork is slow cooked and is not the usual carnitas you get at most burrito places.  I can't remember the name they used but their pork is more like a bbq style, but not tangly like bbq normally is, it's more spicy.  I realize this probably doesn't make sense but I'm really at a loss for words about how good it really was.  The burrito sauce is fantastic, better than Fat Ass's, and theirs was my number one until now.  Burro puts your burrito in an oven so you get a little bit of the crispiness that you would if it was grilled but not too much as to make it crack, crumble and become a mess.  What bumped this place up the rating scale even more for me was the fact that they make their own horchata from scratch.  I asked the lady that was helping me about it and she said she makes it herself for the restaurant.  She was also very helpful in telling me that I can get the syrup at Kensington market so I can make it myself."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. I heard this place (or any within the vicinity) gets crazy packed at lunch, so I waited til 1 to go, after the rush. There was no one in the shop - BINGO! I heard good things about the mole chicken burrito so I got that with all the fixings. The girl at the counter warned me their hot sauce is hot, and let me try it. Indeed it has a good kick so I went with the medium-hot option. However, next time I will get the full hot as you can't taste it as much once you add all the filling.  The small burrito cost me just under $10 with tax.  The burrito was delicious! Chicken was tender and so flavorful. My only regret - getting the small and not the large size! YUM!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burrito place I've been to! Very tasty better than the two popular chain restaurants. I had a very cute first date sitting outside eating. The feeling took me back to eating in South America.  On Saturday night they were out of mole (tears and sobs) and I really want to try this... from Other reviews I hear it's fantastic! oh yeah they put so much goodness into that pork burrito and somehow got it to fit together. Impressive and delicious!"}
{"text":"We had to try this place after a co-worker exclaimed that it was the best burrito he's ever had. The storefront is a little difficult to find as it's off in a side street and looks inconspicuous. I ordered the pulled pork burrito ($11 + change after tax), and found it quite heavy... maybe 2lbs?! The burrito was decent, but I found the inside to be too watery. The best part is that they don't charge extra for guacamole. One of my co-workers ordered the quesadilla with fish and suggested avoiding the fish. His quesadilla didn't look much like what I expect a quesadilla to look like. It wasn't toasted and didn't have that much cheese."}
{"text":"I've been back recently and actually received what I ordered this time (devil shrimp).  I went from two to four stars definitely making this my favourite burrito place. Things actually taste good unlike burrito boys, fat bastard etc. I would HIGHLY recommending eating it right after you buy it, the oil still leaked out quickly on my bad last time and this time wasn't much different. The bad thing is that it stinks in there. They need a better ventilation system."}
{"text":"Good sized burritos and they don't charge extra for guac unlike some other burrito places. I ordered the pulled pork burrito and it tasted great. The small size was more than enough."}
{"text":"Being from the US I have acquired a certain fondness for Mexican food.  Unfortunately most of the burrito joints in GTA are a bit too hygienic in consistency and often lack the kick I'm used to.  Burro absolutely nails it!  I have been able to try about the whole menu and have had a great meal every time.  My absolute favorite though is the Mole burrito.  The manager and staff have always been incredibly nice and helpful every time I visit.  I absolutely would recommend Burro to anyone looking for a great cheap and filling Mexican experience."}
{"text":"This place is very reasonably priced for how delicious their burritos are.  Ingredients are fresh and plentiful.   They're not douches so they don't charge extra for guac. or sour cream. Big fan.  The only issues I have is their \"hot\" is quite mild, so ask them to pump up the hot sauce and they run out of things (like beef!?) if you come late at lunch.  Also, the regular is BIG BIG, no need for the large."}
{"text":"If I'm correct Burro means Donkey in Spanish and that makes perfect sense why this place would be called Burro Burrito because these burritos are as big as a donkey.  I have tried every burrito place worth trying in this city and there are plenty worth eating but none compare to Burro's burrito. These things are so big and so delicious that I walk 35 minutes each way at lunch and mow down on it while walking back allowing the whole world see my messy saucey happy face. Make sure to get the chicken mole and put everything on it and you'll enjoy the best burrito you've ever had"}
{"text":"I'm not a taco snob or a connoisseur for that matter but I know what I like. If I like Burrito Boys do I lose credibility?   Moving on I wanted to try the fish tacos but they were out so I tried the pork and steak.  Wow did I ever reach flavour country! I never experienced such a variety of tastes hitting my mouth. Everything was fresh and loaded with taste. I've been to El Sombreo in Mississauga and Rebozos in Toronto and it beats El Sombreo hands down and sorry Rebozos I liked you but now you've been beat. Can't compare Burrito Boyz to this because it is something different but really you should try.  4 Tacos for $10? What are you comparing it to? 5 tacos for $5 at taco bell? Well worth it. Received a small container of sour creme and 2 small containers of guac and for a guy that is getting used to the taste it's best i've tried.  Before I end this the \"hot sauce\" was actually hot.   Friendly service, I can't say anything more but go. You will thank me later."}
