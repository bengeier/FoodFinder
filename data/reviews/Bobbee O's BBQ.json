{"text":"Okay, if you need a large, fancy dining room for a party get it to go and take it home.  If you just want real deal BBQ this is your spot. In an age when everyone seems to be jumping on the BBQ bandwagon there are so many posers I've gone from cheering to groaning when I hear of a new place opening up. I guess that's what's allowed me to drive by Bobbee O's for years without stopping in. What a mistake.   This first trip we had the pulled pork, brisket, and chicken sandwiches. All were exceptional. So often we find places where the  brisket and chicken are dried out. Not here. We also had potato salad and mac & cheese for our sides (how can you have BBQ without mac & cheese?), again fine exemplars of real deal BBQ.  I won't be driving by without stopping next time."}
{"text":"Not bad, food was good and would definitely go back.  A huge fan of BBQ chicken and they sure did delivered. Oh and the Mac & Cheese, yumm..."}
{"text":"In a word: Awful! Never again, not even for free! In detail: I love BBQ - had it from East to West coast, so when I saw a place with a good rating, I decided to check it out. Picked up some brisket and pulled pork to go, along with a few sides.   Absolutely worst brisket I have ever had. More fat than meat, had one bite, threw away the rest!  Pulled pork was ok at best - a bit dry with some sauce or spices.  Sides were bland, with a clear taste and feel that they were being reheated...for a while.  The sauce... if you like really, REALLY sweet sauce, with a bit of tang and no noticeable spice - then its great! If you like more than cloying sweetness in your BBQ sauce...pass.  But on the bright side, the staff was nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow visiting from Seattle and wanted some legit BBq. This did not disappoint. They were super cool to accommodate my gluten free needs. The surprise hit was the cabbage it So amazing I went back for a 2nd side. All of my traveling companions were equally thrilled with their orders. The staff are super kind. Next time I am in this side of the country I am in."}
{"text":"There are a lot of pulled pork barbeque restaurants in this area, but this is my favorite because the meat is spicy and flavorful. I am excited about the new location and will return often."}
{"text":"Agree with other positive posts.  Brisket is really amazing - not to be missed.  I am not usually a brisket lover.  Pork was pulled too finely for my preference but still very tasty.  Sauce was really good, especially on the brisket.  I had greens and baked beans.  The collards were my favorite of the two."}
{"text":"This is your quintessential Carolina BBQ joint. Fresh pork is amazing.. The bbq sauce is a bit sweet but with Texas Pete, the heat offsets the sugars!!. Leans toward to go orders due to small, nearly non-existent, dining room!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ- unique sauce.  Above average Mac and Cheese.  Beans and BBQ sauce are Spicy, but if you like spicy things, you're in for a treat!  Very nice staff.  Scary from the outside, but suck it up and go inside for some good food!"}
{"text":"The ribs and mac & cheese. Both the spareribs and the baby back ribs were excellent flavor and very tender"}
{"text":"First time visit and will definitely be back! The pulled chicken was super tasty and moist. with a little kick of heat, The macaroni salad was out of this world good -- best I've tasted. The collards and greens rounded out the meal and we're just as good as my mom's! Given my sweet tooth, I had to eat dessert -- the 7-up cake and sweet potato pie were scrumptious (yes, I had both)!  In addition to the wonderful meal, the service was good, staff very friendly; moreover  the location was super cool -- great decor, lighting and seating. All in, I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ spots in Charlotte. The Ribs are very tender and have a nice smokey taste to them. the pulled pork is vinegar based with hint of spice, you don't need any sauce to them at all. the food is very very cheap i got the ribs and pulled pork for only 11 dollars.   I recommend Bobbee Os to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. We love it. Great customer service , food is spectacular, and the new location is great."}
{"text":"Me and the family was craving ribs, brisket and chicken.  So yes we got all three.  I have passedi this place many times and read the reviews.  Best decision I made to stop by and grab dinner.  We were looking to dine in but we are a family of five and it wasn't the ideal place to eat in.  Don't get me wrong its clean and cozy but there are limited seats.  Now the food was very good.  The ribs and brisket are my favorites.  The sauce is very good and so were the side dishes.  Mac and cheese, baked beans, and collards was our choice.    I definitely recommend this restaurant and will be going back again.  Oh yeah and the staff was very nice and professional."}
{"text":"Brisket was good and tender,Mac &Chez was great.  STAY AWAY FROM THE GREENS NOT GOOD AT ALL.  The bbq sauce is good quality get some extra you will want more just .25  Fast service my food was ready and hot. When I arrived.  They said 15 minutes which was perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing brisket. Clean dining room. Mac and cheese didn't disappoint. I will drive the hour to come back anytime."}
{"text":"We found Bobbee O's during a stop in Charlotte on our way from Ohio to South Carolina. The restaurant is an unassuming store front with a small, bright dining area fronting a massive kitchen, complete with black box smoker.  The three of us ordered:  two pulled pork dinners with sides and a pulled pork/brisket combo with sides.  Portions are massive, the meat selections filling half of a large styrofoam take-out box, the sides in their own containers, with buns (or bread) and a small container of sauce on the top.  The pork was tender and juicy with vinegar tang.  The sauce was rich and like the meat, had just a bit of kick.  The brisket was some of the best we had ever eaten, with a dark smoke edge and moist and well-seasoned  beef.  The mac and cheese was different and delightful.  Sweet onion added depth while a bit of heat came out at the end.  The coleslaw was sweet and chopped instead of shredded, and the collards were flavored wth the crispy pork ends.   We had trouble finishing off our meals, making us sad we were staying in a hotel where we couldn't wake up to leftovers for breakfast.  A side note on the service:  although the dining area is utilitarian with plastic tables and chairs, Bobbee and his kitchen staff made sure we had everything and checked in several times to make sure we were pleased with our meals.  You can bet that Bobbee O's will be on our list the next time we travel the I-75 corridor.  We've had \"Q\" all over the country, and this truly was some of the best we've licked off our fingers."}
{"text":"I live probably 2 miles from Bobbee O's and their pulled pork keeps me from needing to drive anywhere else for a great BBQ fix.  We've been here many times and have tried most everything on the menu and haven't found anything I would not recommend.  My go-to meal is pulled pork with collard greens.  The small side of sauce you get is just right and good stuff.  Don't expect any ambiance - it's an easily-missed hole in the wall with folding chairs and plastic tables, but is a destination I highly recommend."}
{"text":"For those of you who don't like to read I'll say one thing. STAY AWAY!!!   First of all, if you like chewing on sand particles and dirt with your fries then you can ignore this and go to the place. We went to this place because all of the other BBQ places were closed at the time and the regular we spoke with was raving about it. I asked how does this compare to lancasters and he said it was much much better. My opinion? The meats in every aspect was utterly dry or underdone.  For a BBQ place you'd think they'd give you their \"special\"/\"secret\" sauce to go on their slow smoked ribs. It's the complete opposite. The bbq sauce that they do give you is mainly ketchup and mixed in with some liquid smoke. The ribs themselves were underdone and extremely tough. You can pick up better ribs at harris teeter and even those will fall off the bone with a fork. No visible signs of smoke rings on the meat so it leads me to believe that they do the typical hotel rib method which consists of some rub and a pan of water underneath to basically boil the rib.  The pulled pork was EXTREMELY DRY. It's amazing how you could get something so dry and gritty. The pulled pork had a raw pork smell to it, one similar to that when you marinate it and pull it out fresh. Based on the faint taste, I can tell where the chef was trying to go with this but it really missed the mark by a mile.   The wings or Wingettes as they like to call them were surprisingly big. Again, they were dry like the above meats. I understand cooking something to kill bacteria and make it safe to eat but seriously this guy is over cooking everything. We ordered ours extra spicy and what came out was extremely underwhelming. They use a generic batch of premade wings with some odd looking coating and then toss it in sauce. I really can't explain the wings more than describing it as one of those prank chicken toys with the artificial yellow skin color.   Hopefully you can see from the pictures i'll post up how abysmal the food here is. I really hope that the guy here can do better and put out some quality bbq next time. It's always a joyous thing in my circle when a new place opens up. I had a friend drive down from NYC on a monday stayed for one meal and left the next day just to eat bbq. We really didn't expect someone from the carolinas to do this bad though."}
{"text":"Food-4.5/5 Pulled Chicken & Brisket was excellent! Sides are a tad small, but next time I'll order a larger portion.  Service-Take out is the best way to go.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Too cheap only giving you a tiny 1/2 cup if that of their great BBQ sauce for a $9 meal. I understand some would abuse but give us two at least if requested before asking for $.25 cents for another tiny side of sauce. Or make the 1 they give you free bigger. I don't like owners that think cheap like this especially when food is very good"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwich. Reminded me of Big Jim's in Charlottesville. Service was quick & really friendly."}
{"text":"Near the corner of Harris Blvd, I did drive past it once looking for it.  I had the beef brisket and pulled pork plate $9.99 was a good value.  Had the mac and cheese (awesome) and coleslaw (average) as sides.  I thought the BBQ sauce was a little spicy for brisket  would be awesome on wings.  All in all it was very good BBQ and see myself picking up some family meals for dinner on the way home.  PS  The whole no free refills on takeout orders is stupid and the only place I have encountered this."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the beef brisket and ribs combo. Ribs were awesome! Makes his own sauce...sweet and spicy vinegar base..very good. Counter service, only a few tables, but back is huge (lots of catering).  Plus Bobee O is a cool guy!"}
{"text":"This place is very decent but I'm unsure why it received 4.5 stars. I found the quality of the food to be very good but below the level of the Old Hickory House. The pulled pork is moist and flavorful. But the sauce doesn't hold a candle to the sauce served at the Old Hickory House. Portions are good here, as are prices. Side dishes are good but also are not as good as the Old Hickory House. That being said, this overall food quality is good and food items are a relative bargain."}
{"text":"This had to have been the best BBQ I've had outta any southern spot I've been to. That muhfuckin brisket my nigga??!! Cooked to fucking perfection! I should call Emeril Lagasse so my nigga can taste the brisket and be like 'BAM!' And that mac and cheese was on bang mode too! Nice texture and allat. You know how black folk don't normally trust everyone's mac and cheese? I assure you, you won't be disappointed by my mans Bobbee O and his Mac and cheese! I might just give up my life in Cleveland and move down to Charlotte just for this food my nigga. I don't wanna be a Northerner anymore. Y'all niggaz hiring?"}
{"text":"Counter gentleman was very helpful for 1st time visitors. 3 of us had different items to share. Onion rings were huge and cooked just right. I'm not a fan of their fries, but that's not the reason for coming. Coleslaw was juicy and had a great flavor. My spouse said the collard greens brought back wonderful childhood memories of her grandmothers cooking. Mac and cheese was baked to perfection and creamy and very cheesy. BBQ  one word, WOW, 1/4 chicken melts in your mouth. Brisket was tender and full of flavor. I'm usually not a BBQ sauce fan, but I tried it and doused everything with it."}
{"text":"Terrible service...i ordered the most basic of items from a BBQ place, a pulled pork sandwich, fries, and a sweet tea. It took 13 minutes from the time I placed my order until my food arrived. People that ordered after me received their orders before my food showed up. It wasn't busy during the time I dined here. The food was average. You only get one choice for bbq sauce and it's loaded with pepper. I'm not sure why I was asked to leave a tip when I payed after placing my order at the register, nobody comes to check on you or refill your drinks. Terrible first experience with this place. I think I'll just stick with Shane's Rib Shack."}
{"text":"Best bbq I had EVER! This spot is a regular for us now.. It's so good!!!!!!!  The St. Louis ribs are to die for, so is the chicken here. I'm so glad I found this place, it's awesome."}
{"text":"It's small and the actual restaurant isn't suited for really dining in but the food is incredible.  Walking through the door kind of feels like walking into a butcher shop to order a cut of meat.    They seem to specialize more in catering and take out.  The pork is fantastic.  It's pulled very finely so if you are a fan of thicker BBQ you won't find it here.  The taste is very full and you can almost taste the care that is put into cooking it.  The sauce is my favorite part.  It's slightly spicy, something different that you don't usually find but it definitely brings everything together.  I compete in BBQ competitions and I recommend the way this is cooked.  The Mac N' Cheese is way above average.  The chopped onions really add a new dimension to a simple dish of comfort food.    All in all, definitely check this place out, it's worth every minute of your time."}
{"text":"Delicious, tender pulled pork sandwiches and mac & cheese exactly how I like it. Baked and with soul."}
{"text":"In addition to BBQ staples, their menu also includes salads, burger, and chicken strips. I ordered online the pulled pork and beef brisket dinner plate. I arrived earlier than the wesite told me to for pickup, and my order was ready much sooner than projected.   The pork was good other than the fact that it had some spices in it, which I don't care for, but I know some people like that. The brisket, cut thicker than normal, was fantastic. It had the perfect subtle smokey flavor, was really tender, and the sweet sauce they served with it matched up well. In the future, I would just order brisket and forgo the pork. The corn, cornbread, and sweet potato fries were unremarkable. All served hot. It was nice that sweet potato fries are an option, many BBQ places don't offer that choice.   At dinnertime on a Sunday night, it was not crowded at all. There were only a few people dining in. The dining area was clean and spacious, there was also plenty of parking. At $13.17 including tax, this meal was fairly priced given the moderate portion sizes."}
{"text":"Barbecue is one of my favorites! And Bobbee O's definitely hits the spot for BBQ For me, family & friends, that visit Charlotte. like Bobbee O's Motto  \"It's All In The Sauce\"!!!  Pleasant  new location and Friendly staff.  Everything I've tried Collard-Greens , Macaroni-Salad are tasty like Grandma's Brisket so Tender, you can Cut with a plastic-fork!!! Pulled-Pork, Pulled- Chicken, All So Flavorful.... It Just keeps you coming!!!  Haven't tried dessert Yet,  usually too full, Thats  Next!!!"}
{"text":"Old stale grey no life in the bbq. If you like food that was cooked days ago and reheated this is your place. Sad is putting it lightly we ordered one of every meat and side. I wanted this to be a diamond in the rough but its only rough. You want good bbq beware go elsewhere!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is small but super clean and delicious .  Maybe 10-12 seats inside and another 6-8 outside .   I am not a bbq expert but , this was some good bbq  the brisket was Not dry it was fall apart good . Ribs had a little fat but they were also fall off the bone tasty . I read in a previous review that the cabbage was very good so I ordered it and it was excellent .  Oh and I like the said they give you on the side it had a little tang to it .   The owner Bobbee himself was taking the orders , maybe it's me but I like it when the owner is their,  for me it means they care about the food and their business  , he was a super nice guy and even posed for a picture ."}
{"text":"Brisket and BBQ sauce was the best I have had anywhere.  Baked beans were different, but very good.  Mac n cheese was forgettable, and the corn bread muffin was inedible.  Went back for seconds on the brisket though!  Place is definitely a whole in the wall, with only 2 tables and a few counter type seats."}
{"text":"Ok, there was a time that we were in this restaurant 3x's a week. It was so bad that I would call and say \"it's your favorite customer\" and he knew who I was and what my order would be. And there are 5 of us in my family. We always get the pulled pork, pulled chicken, Mac and cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese has a unique taste, I believe it's a French onion dip seasoning. I recommend getting double mac and cheese if it's your fav? The beans are great too.   Bobbee O is great, but that coconut cake and homemade banana pudding make you say um, um, um. My husband and I had a discussion and determined that we were addicted to the food and had a mutual intervention amongst ourselves. Now we go occasionally. They are still on my fave list."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Always a lot of cars in the parking lot which I consider to be a good sign.  Dining room has great decore and was very clean.  Ordered the brisket and pulled pork plate.  This is the kind of business I love to support and I hate to even leave a negative review.  However, the meat portion sizes were quite small.  I eat at a lot of BBQ joints and this was the least amount of meat I have ever seen on my \"plate\".  The sauce is fantastic and the Pork had a good smokey flavor.  The brisket was very fatty for sliced brisket.  In fact, it was mushy in spots and was of less quality than I have had even on brisket sandwiches.  The people are great here, but with all the BBQ choices around Charlotte I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"Was at work ordered out with a group of people 9 people ordered an 1hr 30 mins earlier. Didn't get the food until 10 minutes before our break was over. We only had 30 minutes for breakfast. When they brought the food they forgot an order. My burger had bad lettuce that was brown had to pick it off. The mac and cheese was the only thing good except for the tea. It's a good place to eat just not good for ordering out at work. Late delivery and low quality food. Had a picture of the burger will post once I figure out how. Lol"}
{"text":"Is this place for real????? No management anywhere, phone ringing off the hook, they won't answer for take out orders. They had no idea who ordered what. Tables not cleaned. No wait staff.  Do yourself a favor and hire someone to manage that place...."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I am from Texas and used to beef BBQ. The brisket here was good but the ribs and pulled pork were better. Skip the macaroni and cheese if you don't like onions as it's about a third onions. You must get dessert and the pound cake or banana pudding were both AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of my favorite BBQ spots. Having just moved to Charlotte, I've explored a bunch of different places per yelp reviews and this is easily my favorite.   Initially I was hesitant because it's in the middle of no where and once you walk in, it doesn't strike you as a restaurant, but decor aside, the food is delicious.To sum it up: great food, generous portions, good prices. My favorite is the pulled pork which is moist and tender while packing a mouthful of spice. That's without their sauce, which adds even more flavor without overwhelming the spice in the pork. As for sides, they're a little on the small side but I guess you don't need much with the amount of meat they give. The Mac and Cheese is definitely my favorite of the options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for BBQ and randomly decided to try this place, although we had never heard of it. The employees were incredibly friendly. Not only did they welcome us to the establishment, but one employee realized it was our first time and went through the menu with us. He explained what certain items were, what they came with, which sides he would recommend. It was super helpful! Both gentlemen were a delight. The venue is very spacious. It didn't take too long for the food to be served to us. And the food was delicious! The pulled pork BBQ (as a dinner plate) was a little too spicy for my liking. I will probably get it as a sandwich next time. It was still good, though. The employee had recommended the macaroni and cheese side, and that did not disappoint. The employee checked on us to make sure we enjoyed the food, and when we left, offered us a great evening and hoped to see us again. My boyfriend and I will definitely be returning to Bobbie O's. It will be a new staple for us. The prices are very reasonable and affordable as well. The dinner plates offer a lot of food, by the way! (I'll probably just get a combo next time)"}
{"text":"I have been a Bobbee O fan for years now.  Love the new location.  My favorite food is the brisket with mac n cheese and cabbage.  Definitely a hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pork is on point , sauce is amazing but the one small cup they give is never enough ...grab a couple extra for the few extra cents they charge . The BBQ beans with the jalapeños are amazing and Mac and cheese is also worth trying !"}
{"text":"It's the BEST!!! But, asking for extra sauce and offering to pay, sucks. This is the third time we've asked for extra sauce and for two pounds of to go BBQ we received two itty bitty containers. It's ridiculous. We are offering to pay you X amount for whatever you'll give us. This is also the third time we've said we don't need bread and have received half a loaf"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Their food is so good and the service is always top notch. I would recommend them for catering too and when I do have a party that needs it, I'll be hiring them. My favorite is the pulled pork BBQ and the spicy macaroni salad - it's a must try!"}
{"text":"This place really is the real deal. The food was exceptional (and even though it was a little pricey, it was worth every penny.)  The proprietor was there (Bobby O) and he was very proud to share his story and point to a map on the wall that showed that customers had come from all over the globe to visit him here in Charlotte North Carolina.  It has a real \"middle school cafeteria\" feel to the small \"eat in\" area, so I would recommend getting the food to go if you're looking for a more comfortable/relaxing environment."}
{"text":"I love coming to Bobbee O's for lunch. It is right near my office off Harris Blvd. near Northlake Mall. It's one of the better BBQ restaurants in the city and a great location near I-77. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting Charlotte or looking for a new BBQ joint in town."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new because I love bbq so I order post mates for lunch and this place popped up I took a chance and I'm so glad I did this place is delicious I highly recommend this to anyone I'll definitely be trying this place again. I have the St Louis ribs mac and cheese with coleslaw and bake beans I'm in heaven as I type this review"}
{"text":"Great food home made taste and very yummy ! Didn't like them charging Me a extra 25 cents for a 1 oz tiny container of BBQ sauce but oh well ."}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ themed place in strip mall.  Nice employees, ok atmosphere, BBQ very disappointing.  I tried pulled pork, ribs and brisket.  All tasted like boiled meat soaked in BBQ sauce.  Potato salad and slaw taste like from grocery store.  Other 4 BBQ chain places in town are much better."}
{"text":"Good but not what I expected.... I assumed that all of the sides would be homemade but instead the baked beans tasted like they came from a can and the slaw...I was really rooting for this place but I doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know how the barbecue tastes, because they wouldn't give me any, even though I paid for it.  On top of that there was no where to park.  Sooooo, be careful what you order as it doesn't always include what they say.  If you look at the \"family meals\" on the menu, it says \"feeds 4-6, includes 2 lbs of barbecue, 3 family sized sides, and 6 rolls\".  I ordered the whole chicken family meal to go, it felt a little light, I asked if everything was there and they said yes, so I headed home.  I get home and there is most of a chicken, 3 mediocre sized sides, and 6 pieces of white bread.  No BBQ at all, no rolls.  I called and asked them if I could come back up and pick up the BBQ and they said my 2 lbs of BBQ was my whole chicken.  So, basically, them saying that the family meal comes with 2 lbs of BBQ is just a complete lie.  I asked them to please clarify that in the future and they had the nerve to say that I just misread the menu and should know how to order in the future, then said they were really busy and had to go.  Look at it yourself, tell me what you think.  The chicken was extremely dry, the sides were edible, and what can I say about slices of white bread.  I live close now, so I'll come back and try a sandwich some time, but it better be friggin amazing to get my business back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. First off, staff is short and not polite. Second, $40 to feed my family of 4, and that's SHARING dinner platters. Third, almost 40min to get our food. Fourth, 1/2 chicken was so dry I had to choke it down with Cheerwine. (Got 2 chicken plates, and they were both the same, overcooked, dry, and tasteless other than the sauce on the skin) Fifth, Mac and cheese?? Don't be silly by calling this stuff \"Mac and cheese.\" Mushy & gross.  Sauce is amazing, spicy and sweet... good drink selection, and pulled pork was nicely pulled and seasoned.  Don't come here if you want good BBQ. Or fast BBQ. Or cheap BBQ. Just don't come here."}
{"text":"Had the pulled chicken sandwich! I only wish it was bigger! The sauce was awesome! Nice dessert options"}
{"text":"Second time getting takeout from the new location.  Messed up our order (got BBQ chicken instead of pulled chicken), but everything looked so good and was so very tasty we didn't bother to switch the order.  Collards and cabbage in particular are our favorite sides.  The new location has a great dinning room with lots of booths and plenty of room.  Staff is very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was great. The brisket practically melted in my mouth. Only problem I had was there was no Mac N Cheese ready almost 4 hours after opening. Little disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh man, where to begin...? I enjoyed my first visit so much the other day that my husband is on his way there to pick me up a to-go order as I write this review! I tried the smoked chicken and bbq brisket with mac&cheese and greens while hubby had the brisket and pulled chicken with mac&cheese, baked beans, hush puppies and a hot link on the side. We also tried the banana pudding. EVERYTHING was so delicious! EVERYTHING! That brisket was melt in your mouth yummy. Aside from taste I really liked how they packaged the food. (We opened everything to show pics of the food). My husband has a pet peeve about containers touching fresh food. So I'm so glad they're mindful about how they package the food. That's another kudos for sanitation. Plus the restaurant was clean and staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Super clean inside,although it seems most people get they're food to go, there are chairs to dine in. The staff is extremely friendly and helped us make a descision on what to eat by providing samples of their pulled pork and brisket. I ordered the brisket family meal with double mac and cheese and greens. I just moved from Los Angeles to Charlote 2 weeks ago and have never had BBQ in LA this good! I'll definitely be back to try the other goodies on the menu!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the four and five star reviews I decided to try out this joint. I ordered the brisket and pulled pork plate which came with generous portions of each however they were both extremely dry and little to no flavor. The brisket was a specially dry and pretty much Blan.  The cornbread was also extremely dry. The best part of my meal was by far the baked beans. The potato salad had bits of black potato in it so I didn't try it.  When walking in a barbecue restaurant on a Friday night at 6:30 you would expect it to be full. There were five people in the place. I must say I was extremely disappointed and unless they change the way they do things will not be coming back."}
{"text":"If you read my reviews before and tried the places I write about then you will realize this may be the only one you need to read!  i will make this short!  Bobby O's CRUSHES any other BBQ place around.  Midwood, Macs, Jim n Nics.....etc.  Tastes like you just took it off the smoker and the brisket is tender and stretches a little before it tears, yumm. The sauce on the pulled pork is vinegar based with a little spice to it and their signature sauce is sweet but not overpowering (best bbq sauce I have had).  Sides are incredible (mac n cheese/cabbage, collards are my recommendations). Staff is unbelievably friendly!   Flaws: they need another location! it is always hot in there (but that comes with the whole experience of being right next to all of the cooking equipment so it could really be seen as a pro and not a con depending on how you look at it).   Recap:  this is hands down the best bbq but if you are planning on going with more than 4 people I would suggest getting takeout as there is not much room to sit."}
{"text":"Bobbee O's is hands down the best BBQ in the area. Best I've had ever, as a matter of fact. If you live here or are visiting don't be fooled by the hype of places like Macs or Midwood Smokehouse.   Just try this place one time and make sure you get the brisket...I usually do a pulled pork/brisket combo dinner. The sides are OUTSTANDING too."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and great service. We've never been disappointed here and that is saying something. We are all native NC residents and EXTREMELY picky when it comes to BBQ (which is not something you do on your grill ). I highly recommend this spot. They are also a newer small business so give them some love and fill your belly!"}
{"text":"We were hungry and for some reason craving some good ole' BBQ. We came across Bobbee's and decided to check it out. My wife has had their food before catered at their work. So, first time for me. Wife decided on the BBQ sandwich and I selected the BBQ chicken sandwich. Mine was good, but my wife's Pulled Port BBQ sandwich was off the hook! I will totally get that next time. Full of flavor and a great overall Carolina BBQ flavor. She had the coleslaw as her die which was good. The gentleman taking our order suggested the spicy macaroni salad. Let me say this...after eating dinner I walked up to him and gave him a fist bump! It was awesome and so glad he suggested I give it a try.   We'll be back for the Pulled pork BBQ sandwich. The Chicken was good, but i'm a huge fan of the BBQ. So, if you like Chicken, you'll enjoy it with their sauce."}
{"text":"Potato salad result good. Hate that they use so much Styrofoam - sooo bad for Earth. Even dining in,  you get served Styrofoam. Baked beans are sweet  & spicy = good.  Pulled chicken very tasty. Brisket ok,  very fatty. Ribs should be more tender.  Mac & cheese was good. Corn bread is horrible. Okra is good,  taste like mom's. Pulled pork is vinegar overload.  Took about 20 min to get food,  and it wasn't a very busy night"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! The pulled bbq chicken is some of the best I have ever had. Absolutely love their bbq sauce. Restaurant is clean and spacious. Highly recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"The barbecue at Bobbee O's is really tasty!  I ordered the pulled pork and brisket combo plate.  I loved that they included a bun, so I could pile the soft, savory, vinegary NC style pulled pork up with the coleslaw and eat it how it was intended.  The real star, though, was the brisket.  I hate it when barbecue places trim the fat off of their brisket, because it shows me that they have missed the point of brisket, and if they missed the point of brisket, the rest of the food can't be all that great either, can it?  Bobbee O's gets the point.  The brisket melted in my mouth.  Paired with the tangy sauce, it was delicious.    I also got coleslaw and Mac n cheese as a side.  The coleslaw was good, but I didn't care for the Mac.  That's just my personal opinion though.  A lot of people like it, as you'll see in other reviews.  There was nothing wrong with it, it just tasted a little onion-y.  I also tried my boyfriend's potato salad, which was yummy as well.    You can tell they really care about their customers here.  The girl who took our order was super friendly.    If you are in the area, with a hankerin' for barbecue, check this place out."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I thought everything was amazing. St. Louis ribs, Mac and cheese and cabbage...Mac and cheese was unreal!! Wish I lived in North Carolina so I could come back all the time. The staff were so stinking nice too!! Incredibly friendly and kind"}
{"text":"I'm partial to eastern style but the pulled pork sandwich was very good. Sauce (on the side) is s little too honey sweet for me so I left off. Enough flavor and juice without it.   Collards were disappointing though. A little bitter and tasted like they salted the top of my small serving as first few bites were too salty and after that they were bland/bitter.  Staff was very nice and piped in blues was great. I'll return."}
{"text":"If you know anything about me, then you know that at my heart, I am a BBQ lover.  Not only do I love the actual food that North Carolinians refer to as BBQ - pulled pork. But I also love all of the other related foods, sides and drinks that are associated with most BBQ joints in and around North Carolina.    Before I get into the ins and outs of Bobbee O's, I would be remiss if I did not mention that in my opinion, most of the BBQ spots in and around Charlotte are OVERRATED.  You want some examples??  How about the dark, dingy and overpriced Old Hickory House, or maybe the hit or miss Lancaster's, the corporate Smoky Bones, or the always empty, nasty, mustard slaw that Bubba's BBQ on Sunset serves; just to name a few.  With that being said, I think Bobbee O's is one of the few UNDERRATED BBQ joints in the Charlotte area!  If aesthetics and ambiance are important to you, then Bobbee O's is definitely not your spot.  Its one of those places that's somewhat difficult to find if you don't know where it is and parking can be tricky.  Once you get inside, you feel a bit underwhelmed by the decor of the place.  With that being said...the food is surprisingly better than you would expect.   I ordered the half-rack of ribs, and upon getting back to my residence found them to be juicy, tender, and full of flavor.  They seemed to be coated with some sort of vinegar based sauce, which added a nice touch.   I also ordered a pulled pork sandwich, which was tasty, and perfectly complimented by red, vinegar-based slaw.        I was NOT impressed with the sides however.  The mac-n-cheese was good, not great.  The other side I ordered was collard greens.  The collards were just mediocre.  They did not taste as if they were cooked with much seasoning, and required salt and pepper to make them more agreeable to my tastes.  I would like to go back and try some of the other meats offered on the menu such as the brisket which others have said is good.  I would approach the sides with caution however.  In fact, I might not order any sides at all if/when I go back.  Bobbee O's is def worth a try, I think you'll be more than pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was very good and really didn't need any sauce. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. And to add to my glee. It's not far from where I live. Mac and cheese is to die for. Spare ribs are on point. Collards green are great. It taste like down home BBQ to me. Im not sure why others haven't had the same experience I've had but maybe they need to try it again."}
{"text":"Not particularly recommended. Unreasonably slow; we waited over 45 minutes for simple pulled pork meals.  Unremarkable sides. Pork itself was ok to good, but long wait with no feedback left bad taste for us."}
{"text":"I would say that for it to be a small business, you get a lot for your money. I ordered a family rib meal and I was surprised by the amount I received. The sauce for the ribs were good, the potato salad was delicious. The service was quick."}
{"text":"The beef brisket is the winner at Bobbee O's, I dunno how he does it but it is just way too good!  The pulled chicken is good but kinda spicy(at least for 3 year old).  I must say I wasn't always a fan of their Mac n cheese, but it has grown on me.  The cabbage and collards are good but I like my collards on the tender side.  The chocolate chip pound cake was a perfect ending to this meal.  This is one of my go to spots when I don't feel like cooking:-)"}
{"text":"This place looks like what you'd expect a down home bbq to look like.  The staff is friendly and they churn out food in a hurry.  The brisket is passable but the ribs are mushy, without smoke or char and doused in a generic sauce without bite, tang, vinegar or mustard."}
{"text":"Amazing experience with real home cooked food. Everything is fresh and  to order as we tried the Samper with fresh cooked greens, Mac and cheese barbecue beef brisket and there's a famous ribs. Everything was finger licking good the staff was attentive courteous and polite reminding me of an old fashion cookout."}
{"text":"Delicious, good southern cooking, southern hospitality at its best!! I always order food from here for parties and end up having to tell each guest where to get it!!"}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ.  I had dinner with my friends in charlotte at Bobbee O's and was pleasantly surprised wth the meal.  Its a no frills joint with a couple of tables (they do mostly takeouts and catering).  Food is good so can't really complain.  Dinner combination of Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket was my choice.  Pulled Pork was tender and delicious.  Beef Brisket was the best that I ever tasted.  Cost = 10 bucks!    I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Average,  ordered because they deliver. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich.  Loved the slaw.  The sandwich was moist and a touch spicy.  His fries left a lot to be desired.   I got the pulled pork with ribs. Both were moist. The ribs were ok but the flavor was lacking for me. The mac n cheese and collards were great.   Coconut cake was delicious.  The food deserves a four. The girl who took our order made it a three.  She kept getting confused. Then she forgot to add the delivery fee."}
{"text":"We ordered a hot link, ribs, pulled pork, hush puppies, collard greens and fried okra.  The sides were decent but nothing particularly stood out. I thought the pulled pork was too mushy and bland. It didn't feel smokey or feel like BBQ at all. I was not a fan of the texture.  The ribs were good - tender enough to fall off the bone but still had some bite.  To top it off, we had their sweet tea doctored up with some unsweetened tea so it wasn't too sugary sweet.   Space was clean and airy with plenty of seating.   They had a display with various slices of cake that looked good.  Overall, an average BBQ joint with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant in our local magazine here, however I live very close to it.  I've only tried the \"Hot Link\" both times I visited.  Both times it took them FOREVER to make? (I thought what  could take a freakin hot sausage so long to make? )However it was well worth the wait! They also gave me some extra (Bobbee O's BBQ sauce for a small fee) for dipping.  I also had their Mac & Cheese  I didn't enjoy it much bc it had onions baked in it.   However, this is a pretty (expensive) good, place to dine!"}
{"text":"We tried Bobbee O's as part of a BBQ eating tour the week of thanksgiving. It is just excellent which has  good food, a great owner, scrupulously clean premises, and the first top rate bbq brisket I have had in years. The brisket was moist, tender and jiggled with beefy goodness..If you get within 100 miles of this place, make a detour and try it."}
{"text":"I visited their old location a few times and was hopeful for their new spot.  Based on today's visit,  I'm disappointed.  I ordered a 1/2 dozen smoked wings for sit down and was brought a pile of boiled wings in a to-go container.  The wings were large, however, they were cooked either in water or steam causing the skin to become rubbery and distasteful.  It appeared they were tossed on the grill to heat them up, and then slathered 'em sauce.  Not a representation of good BBQ on any level.  Yuck."}
{"text":"I don't even like brisket, but that's what I would order next time. I had a dinner combo plate brisket and pulled pork, with collard greens and baked beans as my sides. The pork was good, top 5 in the area. The sides were good enough. I wish they gave some other type of bread rather than the hamburger bun and slice of bread. Maybe cornbread or Texas toast? Still worth coming out of our way for the brisket."}
{"text":"I am in a sugar coma ... Everything was too sweet! The tea (I did 3/4 unsweet & topped off with sweet; still undrinkable), the slaw was inedible. The pulled BBQ chicken was good and a decent portion but the sauce was too sweet. My boyfriend had the pulled BBQ pork sandwich with slaw (which they said was a sandwich slaw so don't know what the difference is) with fries. He said the pulled pork was good but the fries were a very meager portion and looked/tasted weird. Probably won't be back although it is super close to my office."}
{"text":"Great Food, but check your Take-Out Orders when they're busy. I've had a few mixups. They're great at clearing it up but a good Order Validation would go a long way for them."}
{"text":"i would recommend bobbee o's to anyone. i love this place! it's a total dive but their BBQ is good!  the sauce is a little spicy but delicious. (sauce is served separately and i don't think they give enough sauce and extra costs .25c) the fries are great-- they are just standard potato wedges but their batter is really good.  mac & cheese and baked beans are a little strange to this yankee transplant. the pulled pork is perfect every time. it's neither too dry nor too wet, the buns are fully loaded and will often drop pork out, so be careful!  downside: there are like 2 tables and no A/C so it's more of a take away kind of place. prices are good; i think about $6 for the pulled pork combo."}
{"text":"Please come here great great food best pulled pork and ribs ever all about the food! If your from out of town this is the place"}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint.  Not vinegar-based, which is always a plus, and their sauce is sweet but spicy, and different.  Fries are some of the tastiest potato wedges I've had.  Service is a little slow, but the place is tiny, so it's understandable.  Reasonably priced, big portions, and a friendly staff.  If you're in the mood for BBQ, but want something off the beaten path, go to Bobbee O's."}
{"text":"BBQ is great and Charlotte has some great choices but this is, by far, my favorite BBQ anywhere. The sauce is a bit spicier than most and I love it. The new place is much larger and has plenty of room to sit and eat. The staff are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Yeah, Bobbee No's. Came in on a Sunday with the kids. Only people in there. Ordered some wings and chicken. 15 people came-all have been fed before us. We have 3 entrees...30 min and still nothing. You get a sorry...no, just sorry the wings take 15 minutes to fry. I don't care what this food tastes like. Now 33 minutes later and they brought out the food-its now to go order. Not a sorry, refund or nothing. Helluva first impression...I'm so angry I just gave them $40."}
{"text":"Bobbee O's is by far the best bbq I have ever had. I have tried the brisket, pulled chicken, Mac and cheese, cabbage & macaroni salad and it was all delicious. Everyone was nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"Bobbee's BBQ is the best I've had in NC.  The meats are delicious.   The fried chicken wings are the best fried chicken I've had.   His sides are all top notch.  I can't find a place in NC that compares.   I am glad you finally turned the sub woofer down in your stereo, ' cause it was hurting my ears.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We have been taking food out from Bobbee O's since they first opened, and have never been disappointed. This is definitely a take out joint, they only have a couple of tables set up for diners. I really like the \"open kitchen\" which allows you to watch them putting your order together. Great ribs, great sauce. 'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Strong 4 always with an occasional 5 stars. Brisket is delicious & some of the best I've ever had. Chicken is 3-3.5 stars, pork is solid 4 stars.  Excellent mac & chz. I've heard that their sweet potato pie is unreal but have yet to leave enough room to try it.  Not much room to sit & enjoy, so you most likely will have to get it to go.  Great BBQ at good prices."}
{"text":"the food was very good. I had the brisket, my wife had a cheese burger, and my son had the pulled chicken. There were only two tables here, so I'm glad one was empty when we arrived. The staff was very friendly! This place is more than you would expect from a storefront operation."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!! However they took forever getting my order together and still got it wrong! I called my order in and still was at the counter for 30 min thing to get it straight. The pulled chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese were amazing though!!! (Mac & cheese alittle too greasy but good)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have ever had. The brisket and baby back ribs are a new benchmark for me. The pulled pork was excellent too, but the bark and the flavor and the tenderness of that brisket was so incredibly good, I went back to the counter for seconds. The buns they use for the sandwiches are perfect too. Just enough to get to you mouth where the meat takes over. The sauce was perfect too. A little sweet,- little vinegary and re chile flakes for a bit of spice. Thick, sticky and delicious.  The mac'n'cheese was a bit mushy but the flavor was excellent. Baked beans were great too. Cooked perfectly and slightly sweet with green pepper that gave it an added flavor. I am so glad I stopped here. It was almost by accident too, but more like destiny.  Oh and don't forget to get slice of that delicious chocolate cake. You'll thank me for reminding you."}
{"text":"You see what you get. I like BBQ, I come here. I usually get my order to go because my house has better atmosphere... But the food is good, thats why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner. The cashier did not greet me nor did he respond when I spoke to him. I gave him my order and asked what type of bread came with the dinner, to which he blurted \"bun\" so quickly that I didn't understand what he said thanks to the music blaring through the speakers. I asked for my food to eat in, but it was brought in a takeout box. They ask you to tip at the register. Don't bother. They don't do anything outside of bring your plate to you. The bbq tasted like straight vinegar. Cornbread was dry. Smoked chicken had no flavor. Tea was weak."}
{"text":"Few foods cause as much rivalry, fierce loyalties, and controversy as BBQ.  Like many folks, I love good BBQ, and have my preferences as to meats, sauce, and sides.  For complete transparency, I've been eating 'Q' in various states regularly for almost 40 years, and my favorite is whole-hog pork BBQ with low country SC-style mustard sauce (it's what I grew up with, and to date, I've never had a better style anywhere).  That being said, I respect the other styles/locations, and if it's done right and with love and respect to the meat, you'll get my business.     So...   My girlfriend and I have driven by Bobbee O's many times (and always laughed at the lit neon 'OPEN' sign on the side window that is turned on during hours that the restaurant is clearly not open), and finally decided to give it a try.  We ordered through DoorDash, and the food arrived hot and well-packaged about 30 minutes after ordering (which was around 6:30 pm on a Saturday evening).       I ordered the pulled pork dinner with cole slaw and baked beans, and my girlfriend ordered the brisket dinner with fried okra and cole slaw.  We also ordered a side of Brunswick stew, a side of mac & cheese, and hush puppies as our choice of bread.  Overall, we had a decent first experience (I'd give 3.5 stars if Yelp had that option), with the following pros & cons :       Pros:    *  Almost all of the food looked fresh and had a 'home-made' quality.  I don't know about you, but the last thing I want out of my 'Q' is an industrial-scale, boring chain restaurant vibe.   *  The portion sizes were ample, a good value, and had enough for leftovers.   *  Both the pulled pork and the brisket were moist and tender, and didn't need to be covered up in sauce to be tasty.  But they did not have a massively intense smoked flavor that I've had at other places.    *  The mac & cheese had good flavor, with the addition of a little onion.  It was definitely NOT the 'blue box', and tasted more like 'somebody else's family's recipe', if that makes any sense.    *  The fried okra was surprisingly good, and I absolutely despise okra.      Cons:   *  While the vegetables in the cole slaw looked fresh, appealing, and were perfectly crisp, the dressing was so overwhelmingly sweet that my heart sank with disappointment after the first bite and I couldn't eat any more.  Please watch the sugar !    *  I know deep-fried foods can be difficult to pull off with take-out and delivery, but the hush puppies were not hot, dry in the middle, and seemed almost like an afterthought.    *  The Brunswick stew was okay, not great.  The reason I put it in the cons is that we found not one, but two big bay leaves floating in it.  While I like the flavor of bay leaf, and applaud the cooks for using real spices and herbs, they can be a little weird to swallow, especially if you're not expecting them.       * The baked beans were also a little too sweet for my taste (but nowhere near as distractingly sweet as the cole slaw).  A review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the sauce.  I found the sauce to be neither a pro nor a con.  For what it was, it was fine.  Some people will love it, others will hate it.  It is on the sweet and tangy side of things, and I personally didn't use much of it because I didn't think the meat needed it.  It's not my favorite style, but seemed to be crafted with love, so I can't knock it.  Your results may vary.  My girlfriend and I both remarked that we would like to eat Bobbee O's BBQ again, and maybe try some different items.  The potential for greatness is there with some tweaking here and there."}
{"text":"Thanks to the awesome team at Bobbee O's!!!  Your BBQ, mac & cheese, beans and collard greens are a must have for our parties and family events!  We have several VERY picky BBQ eaters in the family and we all LOVE your pulled pork and that delicious sauce.  We appreciate you all so much!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"Fall off the bone ribs, tangy sauce and great beans.  The wife had a pulled pork sandwich and said it had a nice spicy taste."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today based on yelp reviews and got the Brisket Sandwich. Food was good and I might go again for takeout, just wouldn't eat there. There are two small tables inside and two very small tables for two outside so def. not good for a group lunch (which was my experience). Co-worker got pulled pork which also looked good, but nothing special that would make me go out of my way when other places have better seating / atmosphere for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had in Charlotte. The sauce is the secret and its spicy-sweet combo is amazing. This is a MUST HAVE if looking for a BBQ place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Hands down THE best BBQ I have had in my 30+ years of life and BBQ eating. Any and every time I am in Charlotte I will be stopping here to eat. Coming back tomorrow to try the brisket. Just the smell of proper cooked BBQ wafting around inside is worth the price of a dinner. I honestly have a food buzz right now and am sad my plates are empty."}
{"text":"Went with a large group and some of us waited over 2 hrs to get our order. This location seems extremely under staffed. Food was okay.."}
{"text":"Times here: Once.  Popped into Bobbee O's while down the street for Charlotte Oktoberfest.  Loaded up on some pulled pork, mac and cheese, and hot wings.  The service was friendly and prompt.  This is a 'no frills' joint that boasts about 4 tables and no decor, which is fine by me.  The food is cheap: $4 for a pulled pork sandwich?  Yes please.  The food was surprisingly good.  No complaints; the fried wings were well nigh perfectly cooked and had 'that sauce' on them, which I suspect I could develop a severe addiction to.  The pork itself was fresh, not too shredded, moist and delicious.  Pros: Cheep, well cooked BBQ, delicious sauce, run by friendly people.  Banging wings.  And cheep.  Cons: weird parking situation, no beer.  If you have a party, you're going to have to do takeout.  Yeah, I'll be back.  Bobbee O's is the best BBQ I've had in Charlotte to date, and I've tried a lot of 'em."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place several times, even before they moved to the current location. The food is usually good and enjoyed by my whole family. I've visited twice in the last month and both times have been a little disappointing. One of my favorites sides is the mac n cheese. However, recently the flavor has been altered. Not sure what it is. Too much salt or too many other seasonings ruined the flavor. I can't even get my 2 yr old to eat it anymore. Also the collard greens were bitter with large pieces of meat in it. There was never meat in them before. They also omitted one of the sides in my veggie plate which I didn't realize until I got home. Also the corn on the cob tasted old.    I really like this establishment. It's close to home, clean and the staff is pretty friendly. I just think they need to better supervise the prep staff and stick to the original recipes. The food doesn't taste as fresh as it has in the past."}
{"text":"Had the taste for BBQ so I took a trip in the rain to Bobbee O's.   I must say I'm not impressed. I got the Beef Brisket and Shredded Chicken with Mac & Cheese and Collard Greens.   Beef Brisket has no real taste on its on that's why it's drenched in sauce. Oh and the fat is suppose to be removed BEFORE serving it to customers.   Chicken is tough the sauce is good but the chicken is over done.   Mac & Cheese has okay favor but the noodles were cooked tooooooo long.   Greens have great flavor but the hard stalk part is SUPPOSE TO BE DISCARDED!!!  The sauce is very good but the food is still so-so. The prices are a bit much for a BBQ joint.   Sorry Bobbee."}
{"text":"Pork and brisket were great , the greens and coleslaw were outstanding!!!!  I would highly encourage everyone to try Bobby O's!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Bobbee O's BBQ for the first time tonight. Got it to go through Door Dash. After reading multiple reviews, we were a little skeptical but willing to give it a try. I ordered the brisket plate with two sides, fried okra and coleslaw. My BF got the pulled pork plate with coleslaw and baked beans. I also ordered us single sides of mac and cheese and Brunswick Stew to share. It was a lot of food. We did opt for the extra meat which was $2.00 extra, but what we received was what I would consider a regular portion and seemed small to be considered extra meat. Size aside, the both the brisket and the pork were seasoned well and flavorful with a nice balance of fat to meat on the brisket. There are a lot of bad reviews about the mac and cheese but I found it to be really good! It tasted like homemade. Perhaps most of the people who didn't like it are used to box mac and cheese. The fried okra was perfect! The coleslaw was fresh and crisp but had too much sugar. The beans also had a tad too much sugar. And finally, the Brunswick Stew. I consider myself a Brunswick Stew snob, so I was not surprised to find that I did not care for Bobbee O's stew. It was flavorful and spicy but had far more ingredients than I care for. I like my Brunswick Stew a little less crowded. Overall, the food was good. I would order there again."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ joint that far surpasses Shane's Rib Shack and whatever else similar that's in the area. I discovered this place thanks to Yelp because I was craving a pulled pork sandwich and was tired of the places that I normally frequent.  Bobbee O's is nestled in the shopping center off Harris Blvd that includes Haverty's, a BP gas station, and Hilton Garden Inn hotel. It has a long table against a wall with bar stools and an open area with table seating.   You can place your order via phone, in person, or by an app. I placed my order in person because when I called, I was put on hold long enough for me to be able to drive there from my job. It was about quarter to 1:00 and the place was pretty jumpin.' I ordered the pulled pork sandwich combo (drink & fries) and my total was $7.03. I failed to check in before I ordered and missed the 10% offer so CHECK-IN TO YELP WHEN YOU ARRIVE TO SAVE 10%.  I waited around 5-7ish minutes and my order came out piping hot. Seriously, my fries were steaming. Bobbee O's earned an additional star from me solely due to the fries. It was a pleasant surprise to learn that they serve seasoned fries. SO GOOD.  The pulled pork was slightly spicy (which I like) and very juicy. They provide you a mini container of sauce that perfectly tops off the sandwich. I was so pleased with my meal and really look forward to coming back to trying everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Bypassed another BBQ spot to try this one. The reviews were \"spot on\". We happen to like vinegar based BBQ and this was delicious. The tiny bit of sauce served with the BBQ was OK , but sweet. I do wish they had offered a larger container of it on the tables.  Surprised about the Texas Toast, thought it was on the side - it was the sandwich. Parking out front indicates a one hour maximum - you won't have a problem getting in & out in that amount of time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in all of Charlotte. Try the brisket, pulled pork or ribs- Mac and cheese is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Really good BBQ - the sauce is nice and spicy.  Baked beans are good also, but I like the sauce on the thicker side; theirs is a bit more watery - but still tasty. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Taste is still the same, if not better. However, the smoke in the restaurant is so bad. My clothes has a very overwhelming smokey smell afterward. Please get a better ventilation system!!!!!!!!!! Will change to 5 star if you fix this."}
{"text":"I stopped in Bobbee O's last night, as it's been on my \"things that I pass by every day on my commute to work, but I've never been to\" list.   First impressions----(I figured I was going to get my meal to-go anyway), but this place appears to be a heavy takeout type restaurant. There was no one inside, and the place had maybe one or two tables.... made no difference to me, but thought I'd point that out.   With no prior knowledge of the menu, stepped up and ordered instinctively: pulled pork plate, baked beans, fries, ice tea....standard bbq fare. After taking my order, and filling my tea, I sat down next to \"Bobbee O\" to enjoy some of the evening news. Food came pretty quickly, and I was on my way.   Let me agree with some of the prior reviews: the actual BBQ was great, the sides needed some work. It was a very generous portion of pulled pork, which was mildly sauced--and came with a small additional portion of a really delicious sweet style sauce (ITS ALL ABOUT DA SAUCE, says Bobbee O). The fries were really large, kind of like potato wedges, and the baked beans seemed canned--just infused with onion and green peppers....I'd like to see them add either Potato Salad or Brunswick Stew to their side items, and hopefully prepare them with as much care as they take the meat & sauce.   I actually saved most of the pork, and created a pretty fantastic BBQ sandwich for lunch the next day.   To me, BBQ joints are innately independent and homegrown, and I always try to visit spots like this whenever I can."}
{"text":"this was my favorite BBQ in Charlotte until my last visit a couple weeks ago. I dont know what happened but the ribs were not even close to what they had been, and on top of that they did not put the sauce in the package ,.so I did not even have that to help out the tasteless ribs.And the price went up, that would not have been a problem if they were the same quality as the past.  I am very sorry that this happened , I will miss the old ribs, and will not be getting anymore of the new ones."}
{"text":"The Brisket  I'm disappointed to see that the brisket is somewhat chopped - not fine - and it is covered in sauce. The brisket was overcooked, perhaps the result of arriving at 8PM, but the place advertises open until 11PM. It wasn't horrible, I'd say average. Putting some more sauce on it made it better, but now I'm liking sauce and not brisket.  Verdict: I'll not order brisket next time I come here.     The Ribs  It's ok that the ribs had sauce on them. I eat them wet and dry. And sometimes put sauce on dry rub ribs. But, they were also overcooked; and dry. The meat was too chewy.  Verdict: I'll not order the ribs next time I come here  The Chopped Pork  OK, this turns out to be the best of the three meats. The flavor reminded us of the pork that Byrum General store in Shopton - in Steele Creek - used to serve before they shut down. We liked Bryum's and we liked this. This probably makes a great BBQ Sandwich! Although I'm not a fan of putting sticky type sauce on pork, their sauce was decent with the pork. I  Verdict: I'll order this next time I come here.     The Sauce  The sauce is a thin red sauce that looks like a thin jelly when you first look at it. It is sweet, and not really hot. They say a little sweet and a little hot. probably a little less hot.     The Sides  Sorry I didn't take pictures of the sides.  The best of the sides was the Mac and Cheese, it was a little bit salty but had great flavor and loaded with cheese.  The baked bean just really didn't stand out. They were good, but were like heavily buttered pork and beans without the pork. Dropping some of the brisket and chopped pork in the beans made them much better.  The Sweet Potato Fries were, about what you'd expect  The slaw, we have is a mixed verdict on it. Becky liked it; I thought it had a fish flavor to it. Which if you aren't expecting it...  Bobbee O's is place I'd go to if I were local to the area and didn't want to drive far for BBQ.  Understand that I've eaten at many places that I'll never go back to, under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Would have given it 5 stars if the atmosphere improved.  2 tables and a countertop is all that is offered.  With that being said, this BBQ is INCREDIBLE.  The beans are superb too.  Get it to go or be super casual and you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Let me put this simply, some of the worst BBQ I've ever had. Ordered beef brisket and pork spare ribs. Both were bland, flavorless and over cooked. It honestly tasted like they steamed or boiled their meat. Regret driving all the way to this place and will never go back."}
{"text":"We stopped by on Sunday after doing some furniture shopping near by.  After being told by so many people that there is no good BBQ in Charlotte, we were VERY happy to stumble upon Bobbee's.    The place is tiny and can get hot, but I it's really clean so we stayed and ate there.    The woman at the counter (Rashina?) was so kind.  We told her we'd just moved to NC and that this was our first BBQ.  She gave us both some of the pork and brisket to try.  I rarely eat pork, but this was so tender and had that vinegary sauce, simply delicious.    My husband and I each order dinner platter (even though it was lunch time) because we wanted to try as many items as possible.  I make my own brisket and have high standards which Bobbee O's exceeded! That meat was ridiculously tender and beautifully caramelized.  My only disappointment is that it was fatty.  I'll ask next time if they can give me leaner cuts.  However, I rarely eat meat and when I do there has to be no gristle and no fat, etc.  So I'm a bit extreme.  Others would love this flavorful meat.  As another reviewer said, the fat just melts in your mouth.    We both had the pulled chicken, which was also moist and absent of any fat or gristle you sometimes find in pulled meat products. My husband had the ribs and they too were tender, caramelized and delicious.  My favorite side was the mac & cheese.  So often restaurants serve the bland Kraft mac & cheese like dish.  Not Bobbee O's, their was packed with cheddar flavor.  Beautiful!  The restaurant is not that close to our home, but we will definitely trek out there next time we have a hankering."}
{"text":"First barbecue place I have been to in Charlotte where both the meat and the side were good. Everything was great! The macaroni and cheese, greens, and beans"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The pulled chicken is my fav. Their BBQ sauce is amazing!!!  You do have to pay extra for more sauce. I've found myself coughing up the coin for more of that crack sauce... Yeah it's that addicting. The baked beans are good as well. It is sweet and I believe it has onions and diced green peppers in it. The Mac & cheese is tasty as well. The taste is an acquired one. They make their with chopped onions and its not very cheesy. I dig it and I think you might too. Go give them a shot... Now :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious fatty brisket. SPICY 'Q. Ribs! Stingy sides. Friendly. Clean."}
{"text":"I visited Bobbee O's because it was close to my hotel and because it was very highly rated on Yelp. Unfortunately, I must disagree with the 4.5 star ratings.   I ordered the ribs and pulled pork. Neither were bad, but they also weren't very impressive. The ribs seemed like they had been boiled, not smoked. I spoke to the owner and he said they use en electric smoker, which explains why there is no smoke ring in the ribs. But The meat was not very tender, and it honestly reminded me of Costco ribs.   The pulled pork was a little better than the ribs, although also nothing to write home about. I don't have anything good or bad to say about it. It was just pulled pork."}
{"text":"Wings came out cold a cheerwine tasted watered down. Fries and hush puppies are delicious. I should have went with my instincts when I walked in. When a BBQ place doesn't smell like BBQ you should just turn around and find another location."}
{"text":"This place is 20 miles from my house, and I've made the roundtrip trek here many a times, and try to find other reasons to work near there often!   Bobbee O's is a hole in the wall joint in a small strip small across the street from an industrial park. But don't let the location fool you, its the best kept secret in Charlotte!   Bobbee O's is HANDS DOWN the best beef brisket I've ever had! Do yourself a favor and splurge for the extra dollar to have it on Texas Toast. Delish!  One of the keys to their success is \"Da Sauce\" -- sweet and tangy, with a nice spice to it. It goes great on absolutely anything.... brisket, BBQ, pulled chicken, or just straight out of the cup!  Why are you still reading this??? Just go see Bobbee O's for yourself! (And thank me later!)"}
{"text":"Very clean, great service. Pulled pork was fantastic, spicy with some crushed red pepper. White chicken was fall off the bone tender and very flavorful. Excellent BBQ stop near Interstate 77 and 485 north of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Glad I finally tried this place! They use turkey in their cabbage and greens which makes me happy because I don't eat pork.  The macaroni and cheese is bomb!  The brisket was pretty good too.  The sauce is super yummy if you like sweet and spicy. Great prices! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a really affordable bbq joint with good food. I am not a fan of their pulled pork or brisket because I found both too be too dry (maybe it was a glitch, I give it another go at a later time). I, however love their ribs and sides. As far as sides go...they have the best mac and cheese I have ever had in NC and I've tried A LOT. Their mac and cheese is unique and not your typical elbow macaroni. I can't even describe how good it was. I would go back just  for the mac and cheese!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ place in the north Charlotte area. Had pulled pork, cole slaw, sweet potato fries and a corn muffin. All was perfect. Corn muffin rivals my Grandmoms. And that's not a compliment I give out freely."}
{"text":"From a food and beverage director, this is some of the best BBQ around the eastern US. Every item we ordered was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had the ribs and pork and it was the best I've had in awhile. I could eat that barbecue sauce on anything."}
{"text":"I really hate to give bad reviews but this place lacked service and a lot of flavor in their BBQ.  Their brisket was super dry and you pay so much for such little food.  Their buns was not even toasted and for it being a very popular BBQ place by others I definitely would not be returning."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  Tried Bobbee O's for the first time tonight and I can assure you I will be back. The beef brisket was great, the spicy mac salad was just that: spicy (and yummy) and the cole slaw was the perfect kind of sweet. I was not particularly fond of the cornbread muffin though. Eat here soon if you want great Que!"}
{"text":"I picked up a bunch of pulled pork for a party last weekend. We've always liked the food and all my guests did too!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after work one day a few weeks ago. Food was average at best. The biggest issue I had was customer service based. I stepped in when there was only one other customer in the building. No greeting until I approached the counter and spoke first. While ordering my food I inquired about whether or not if I got a fountain drink I could get refills as I waited for my food (they have a sign saying something about to go not having refills). The answer was not just no but \" why are people always trying to get over\".....really???? That's how you talk to your customer? I was immediately  turned off to this restaurant and instead of sitting there thirsty I walked up to rudino's pizza (same shopping center) and paid 0.20 less for a fountain drink with as many refills as I want....I will never eat here again. I didn't appreciate his callous attitude, plus Lawan's and Floyd's are both much better food-wise. Since when do people put onions in macaroni?????? But I digress..."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ, and hands done the best BBQ sauce in the Northlake area. If you're a fan of sweet, smoky sauce, you can't go wrong. I ordered the pulled pork and it did not disappoint. The fries are wonderfully seasoned, and the ribs are fall off the bone good.  Extra sauce."}
{"text":"I love a good southern BBQ plate, and this place reminds me of my uncle bill who used to do a whole hog.   This was my first time hearing or eating their food and I am so glad I did.  I got a pulled pork plate, with fries and slaw. My boyfriend got the brisket plate with Mac and a corn bread muffin. For the price you get a very generous amount."}
{"text":"This is usually my go-to quick-service BBQ place for the area, and the food is great and decently priced. However, service could be improved. I'm disappointed they removed online ordering - I called and got put on hold for just under 5 minutes, but still a long time to just be waiting on a silent phone line. Other than that, they've got good BBQ and great side options. I definitely recommend giving it a go."}
{"text":"Wonderful small bbq. Gotta try the pulled pork. Try without sauce then with it. The sauce makes a difference. The ribs are fall off the bone. Eat like a vacuum. Sides need work, but ur there for the bbq. Still 5 stars. Prices are very low for a lot of food."}
{"text":"My mother has raved about this place a few times and so today when she asked if I'd like to check it out, I agreed.   I ordered the beef brisket & pulled chicken. I loved the BBQ sauce but was a little confused about the plain bun and bread slice. Toasted bread would've been good. This place was really close to getting at least 4 stars until mid way through our meal, big groups of people started coming in for what we were told was going to be a graduation party. That's fine. We continued to eat until one of the employees (nice young lady) decided to come by our table with a poster and ask if we could stand up out of the booth so she could stand on the booth seat to hang a poster on the window. Huge NO NO. She also let us know that the graduation party begins at 7pm. It was 6:30). No one had the courtesy to let us know that we would have to leave at a certain time.   Around 6:30 a family came in, ordered and sat behind us, after sitting for a couple minutes someone came to tell them that there was going to be a party and they would have to get their food Togo. Very unprofessional.   I wanted to really like this place but this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth. Unfortunately, I will not be recommending to others."}
{"text":"Decent. Definitely not in the top 10 in the country. No real BBQ smoke flavor. Everything from service to food was just decent. Tried BBQ pork,BBQ chicken and sweet potato fries. Slogan is \"all about da sauce\". Truthfully,when visiting a BBQ establishment,shouldn't it be \"all about the BBQ\"?"}
{"text":"I liked the pulled pork, but the sauce was just not right...not a real Carolina style sauce by my taste.  Wha really set me off was the collards.  They shouldn't be bitter.  I couldn't finish them...terrible.  Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork and brisket.   Both were very tender. We had only sandwiches as menu and host are both a little confusing.  Parking is THE WORST. Pretty much. a take out situation."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork I think I have ever eaten.  This is the real deal.  I would give them 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall BBQ joint.  Loved the pulled pork."}
{"text":"I tried them for the first time today, it was a really nice surprise. I had the Baby Back Ribs dinner. The ribs were delicious, and tender. Some of the most amazing barbecue sauce I've ever had in my life! I also had the Mac and cheese and potato salad. The potato salad was really tasty but the Mac and cheese was kinda soupy and the pasta was a bit over done.   A very pleasant surprise was the coconut cake! OMG!!! I tasted it in the car and rushed back in for another slice! It's really really moist and the frosting was out of this world.    It looks really nice in the there and it's very clean. I would definitely recommend that everyone gives them a try. I know I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place! I've never been to the location as I always order delivery... I do pay an extra delivery fees but it is soooooo worth it! The meat is tender and perfectly seasoned. All the sides actually taste like they've been made fresh. I don't think I could even pick a favorite side. I always get brisket and ribs... and let me tell you, yum! It's always packaged nicely and the drivers have been very polite. I'm currently visiting from VA and just had to get some before going back up north. This food is seriously good... so good, it'll make you slap you momma! ;)"}
{"text":"Was looking for Texas style bbq this place says it's all in the sauce Texas style u only put sauce on if your trying to hide some thing.  But for Carolina style flavor good big servings hard to beat only complaint ordered a rib sandwich but it still had the bones ?  Had to pull apart to eat !! If I wanted to fight the bones I would have ordered a rib plate. But over all good place just a different style than I like"}
{"text":"Pulled pork BBQ is awesome! Some of the best I've had and the sauce is delicious! I love their potato salad as well! Brisket was just ok, kinda dry. Ribs we very good, fell off the bone. So long story short get  the BBQ! Staff is always super friendly and treats customers like family!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The food is a tiny bit spicy and for my zero spice tolerance family this was a problem.  It wasn't runny nose or sweaty brow spice, it was a bit of a hello to your palate.  The people working there are really nice and the food is slow cooked goodness.  A bit of a soul food and southern NC BBQ fusion.  The thick slices of white bread remind me of TX bbq.  The prices are good, the food is fresh and you can watch it being made.  The reason I couldn't do 5 stars is that this is really a carry-out joint with minimal seating if you are chowing down alone.  Not suitable for date night.  Wifey loved loved loved the mac-n-cheese, she said it was as good as Dixie Bones - she loves Dixie Bones."}
{"text":"Extremely rude customer service I understand establishments can get busy around lunch time but that does not mean you should treat customers with little to no respect will not be dining with this establishment."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place! I called at 8:52 pm (they close at 9:00 pm) on Memorial Day to call in an order and told them I live ten minutes away and would be there. Guess what they fulfilled my order! I got there 10 minutes after they closed and they still let me in! Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Love this place .. great portions and wonderful set-up and decor.. delicious cakes for dessert.."}
{"text":"OK, so I've been back a few times and reduced waitings mean increased ratings! Really digging the barbecue rib sandwich, it's like nothing I've had since moving south. Three spicy, hot, and sticky St Louis Ribs on the bone on Tejas-toast! Really, bones in the sandwich meat! Get two, put one in the fridge for tomorrow morning with slaw, you'll be glad you did. Meanwhile get something cabbagey to balance that sweet thick sammich, and have a couple coffee too, black - no cream or sugar. Seeing improvements in wait times and the food is as good as ever. Still a good idea to call ahead though, you'll not want to hurry through this lunch."}
{"text":"Bobbee O's is a small barbecue joint on the east side of Old Statesville Rd just north of WT Harris.  The interior's small (seats ~10) and plain, the food served on styrofoam plates with prepackaged plastic utensils, but the food itself is alright.  They have \"St Louis style\" and baby back ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, barbecue chicken, and various two-meat combinations.  You can get just the meat, or a dinner that also includes two sides and a couple slices of white bread.  The pulled pork has a distinct vinegary flavor that was too strong for my taste.  I liked the ribs better, with a sweet sauce that finishes spicy.  The sides I've tried are better than average: the mac 'n cheese, collards and cabbage were all mighty good.  You can finish it off with a piece of one of the cakes homemade by the owner's wife."}
{"text":"Plenty of good reviews for Bobbee O's, so we stopped in one afternoon while in the area and shared a pork plate, to find that, like most places, it completely depends on what you like.  The good news is that the people manning the register are very friendly, and that can make up for a lot. Unfortunately, the ones delivering the food? Not quite as friendly. But that's okay - it didn't require as much at that point.  On the inside, the place looks great: Spacious, nice colors, well decorated. Which is an odd mix when you get your food. It's served in styrofoam containers, with aluminum foil and the like. Not that I have anything wrong with that, but it just doesn't match. If I were getting it to go? Sure. But eating in, you would expect slightly better presentation, as it takes a way a bit. Even those marginally better plates at the dollar store might do some good here.  Anyway, the food.  The meat, of course, should be the star. Strangely, when you walk in, you are greeted with a sign that says something like \"the secret is in da sauce\". To me, that says right away that the meat is not - and there isn't really anything wrong with that, but be ready in case you expect something else. If you've ever had some SC mustard-based 'cue, this is similar in style. It's more like a basted meat, very wet, instead of the smoked variety more common around here. It's not that the flavor is bad, by any means, and it has good flavor, but it is indeed in the sauce, not the meat, and it's much different.  When it comes to the sides, the hush puppies seem to be premade - the long, skinny kind. Simple, reasonably tasty, and they go well with the sauce. But I don't think they are made in house. They have that look that says \"no way these could be made here\", as they are too similar in size and shape. The mac and cheese had reasonable flavor, but it was a bit congealed, as if it had been sitting for a while. Had it been fresh, it would have been better. Also a different pasta may have gone better - a fusilli noodle or even a regular macaroni noodle maybe.  The good news is that the plate is a lot of food. We ordered two buns with the plate, made two sandwiches and still had leftover meat. If you like sauce, you may want to ask for extra, as you only get one little container with the plate, as the bottle on the table was ketchup."}
{"text":"It should be called \"Bobbee No's\". I ordered double mac & cheese with barbecue chicken. Now don't get me wrong, they did an AMAZING job on the tenderness of the chicken. It fell RIGHT off the bone. It had absolutely no flavor which just did not make any sense to me because how can you make barbecue chicken without any seasoning??? So let's get to the mac & cheese cuz come on now...who can really mess up mac & cheese? Ok, apparently they missed the memo because I'm not understanding why you put large onion chunks in mac & cheese. I could've sworn it was JUST mac & cheese. Where in there does it say onions??? It was oily & poor quality cheese then add the onions. I just threw it all away because I was so disappointed in everything . We need to have a moment of silence for Bobbee O's for this."}
{"text":"Awesome amazing place to eat. I've been looking for a barbecue restaurant for quite sometime now and I'm so glad I found this place. The food was awesome the service was great and the quality was right on point."}
{"text":"Overall: Best Mom & Pop pulled pork in N Charlotte  Ambiance: Hole in the wall with 10 seats Service: Promt, curteous, professional. Food: Brisket is middling, pulled pork is exellent, lean, and perfectly spiced eastern NC style.  Collard greens are ok, cabbage was good, sauce has a distinctive tangy sweet flavor."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. I love the beef brisket.  The owner Bob is a great guy too. Amazing service"}
{"text":"New favorite place!  The beef brisket sandwich was amazing.  I would have taken a picture,  but couldn't put it down long enough."}
{"text":"No good. I  came here on a Sat night and placed my order to go and i was waiting for 20 mins. Turns out they forgot to fill the order and I had to go up to the counter and tell them I was waiting for so long. Then I realize they gave me a small drink cup when I paid for a large cup. Finally I get home and I look at my food, the beef brisket was nasty, I mean really nasty. It was all fat and I couldnt eat it. The fries looked and tasted like something you buy and microwave from the grocery store, I remember the old fries they used to have which were much better. The only thing going for this place is the mac and cheese and the pulled pork.If you are going to expand then properly train your staff and serve the consistent quality of food that the customers are used to eating. Too many strikes for me to return, sorry guys you just lost a good customer."}
{"text":"We pulled up on a Saturday night for an early valentine's day dinner and they were dead. We were going to leave but we decided to try some place new and stick with our original idea. Let me tell you, I'm glad we stayed.  The macaroni salad was the best EVER. Baked beans were great. My husband loved the greens and I agree, they were spot on. Brisket was so moist and the ribs and chicken were both fall of the bone and flavorful on their own without sauce. Lastly, I agree with their motto that 'it's all in da sauce' because the sauce is slap yo mama good with a little kick at the end. We live 40 minutes away but we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best anywhere and I have had bbq around the world!!! Anytime anyone comes to visit, they get a trip to eat here! Anytime I hear someone talking about bbq, they hear about this place!!! Amazing"}
{"text":"I love this place wow. I live not even two min away from here and have never tried it untill today what a mistake. The brisket was perfect a great smoky flavor with a nice char around the edges a great bark. The baked beans had real nice flavor. My wife got the pulled pork sandwich it was amazing as well nice tangy vinegar taste real nc style to it. Id give the brisket a 10 out of 10 though it was simply delicious and i will be eating here very often."}
{"text":"This place was once a really reliable spot for BBQ at the old location. That has changed, the food and customer service have taken a big dive since moving and it sucks. Hate to see a place let there employees run this place into the ground. 2 stars cause the mac and cheese is so good regardless"}
{"text":"By the Way .. No way ever 2 stars BS ..I'm gonna give Bobbee O's Q a 5 because it's the best I've had in the Charlotte area. He does all his smoking in house and puts a little spice to the sauce. Slaw is good and combined this makes a Dang Good Q sandwich. Not much of a sit down but grab and go you won't be disappointed. Probably been here 10x always on point."}
{"text":"I have seen this place a lot before I decided to get some take out from them.  My first impression when I walked in was skeptical as there was only one person in the restaurant and they worked there.  The gentleman was very friendly and food was ready very promptly.  I would hope so as I mentioned no one was there.   Well in my opinion you judge a BBQ place by a sandwich.  When I got the sandwiches home my 3 year old tried hers and cried.  The Pulled Pork BBQ is so spicy it kills every other flavor.  I think it would great if they toned it down and gave it more of the taste.  The crazy thing is I like spicy food but this was unbearable.   This was the only time I was there so I give them 3 stars.  I will be back to try it again and will give an updated review based on my experience."}
{"text":"Everytime i come here the place is clean. The staff is pleasant and courteous. Excellent sauce! Great blues music. Flat screens  really wish they had a small bar. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants great BBQ in charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, meat is cooked perfectly and the sauce is amazing.  I really like sweet potatoes fries and am a bit of a snob but they didn't disappoint in the least.  Fried pickles were good as well.  One meat dinner meal was perfect size for me."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I'm not sure I'm in LOVE with bbq.. So perhaps take my review with a grain of salt.. The brisket was good. The sauce was yummy, the individual sides seem priced well however the sizes are TINY so not truly, and everything for dine in is served the same way it would be for take out. I'm giving this place a 4 star review because it's a brand new location and in hopes that they will change their serving style and recognize that their sides are super small..( if you get the individual Mac and cheese side, there are approx 5-6 pieces of penne Pasta in cheese)"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ, fried okra is on point. But PLEASE for the love of God, somebody go in there and show them how to make mac and cheese. My taste buds have never been more insulted by a macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"As promised,  I'm still going back. ..I am really rooting for this restaurant on a service level to iron out the kinks and rise above its competitors . .. I mean the food is good,  but they keep missing the boat as far as stellar service. .. The kitchen is slow and they often appear very confused, and when you on your lunch break,  prompt ticket times are a must. .. Come on ya'll. ..I'm rooting for you. .. invest in some training for service and watch your business blow all Barbeque spots out of the box...  Service is the key; consistent stellar service!"}
{"text":"I'm rounding up, but I think Bobbee's is a 3.5. I ordered a half rack for a late lunch with collards and \"corn cobblettes\" (never heard that term) aka 1/2 an ear of corn on the cob. They give you a true 1/2 rack, so it's a large portion. I thought the taste was above average, no heavy smokey flavor, but not bland either. However, the texture was perfection. Literally fall off the bone ribs that melt in your mouth. They took their time cooking these. The service as average, as I got takeout. Also note that this is a smaller establishment and nothing fancy, but serves its purpose if you want to sit down and eat. Get the feeling it's more geared towards takeout."}
{"text":"My fella heard good things about this place and I grew up on great barbecue so I was down. We looked at the menu online and even though they deliver, we decided to go in for our first time trying it. I saw banana pudding on the menu and I had my heart set on it.   The physical space isn't anything fancy, but I wasn't here for the ambiance. I went to the register and asked about the banana pudding. I was told they didn't have any and hadn't had it in weeks. I went ahead and ordered a pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the brisket dinner with mac and cheese and beans.   We both really liked our food. The sauce they gave us seemed like a small amount but it was so flavorful and spicy that a little went a long way. My bbq was well cooked and tender. The mac and cheese was also really good. I prefer elbow macaroni but the penne was good nonetheless. My boyfriend loves the brisket, especially because there was a good deal of fat on the meat (to that, I say \"gross\" and he says, \"awesome\"). He agreed with me on the mac and cheese and said he liked the spiciness of the beans. To top it off, every employee that we interacted with was friendly and professional.   In general, we really like this place. If they had had the banana pudding and had it been as great as the rest of the food, I would give it five stars. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I had a catered affair the food was amazing many of my guest said they have never had better barbecue baked beans coleslaw potato salad chicken pulled chicken and  pork in their life I was shocked. The food was fresh and appealing to look at. It was accurate. I gave it 5 stars because. O thing was wrong."}
{"text":"Best. Barbie. Q. Evarrrr.  Got 1/2 lb brisket. It was so good, I finished it and ordered another 1/2 lb. The meat is so moist and tender. And the bbq sauce.... The bbq sauce is so good, I'd drink it. Yea...."}
{"text":"Any excuse or reason I have to make a trip down to North Carolina I always need to make a stop at Bobbee Os.  So far one of the best bbq food I have ever had! My favorite is the Pork ribs, beef brisket, with a side mac and cheese, beans, and collard greens. My fiance had the pull pork and chicken which is also sooooo good!  Friendly staff and a clean resturant is also a bonus.  If only they had place like this in Boston.  Looking foward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ and great service! Loved their crispy fries. Looking forward to trying their hush puppies - should be getting them soon. The BBQ is very moist and tasty."}
{"text":"My grandmother use to say if you don't have anything good to say don't say anything at all. Well grandma I have something good to say just not a lot. I love good bbq the problem is it's hard to find a good spot. I have tried quite a few places and anything I have founds decent is either over priced or no where near my home. The closest thing to me that's decent is Shane's. Bodrick I have passed quite a few times so I decided to give it a try. The experience was not good to say the least! I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's not the cooks but more so the ingredients/brands they use. The ribs had a lot of fat on them! The fries has some spicy seasoning on them that's not good. The fried cheese sticks are horrible, almost like the cheese is a powder. The bread was dry. And the mac and cheese had the same powder taste as the fried cheese sticks. However on a good note the potato salads delicious and so is the bbq sauce they use on the ribs. Maybe they should sale only potato salad and bbq sauce. ?? The only thing that kept me from getting my money back was I try to support small businesses, but never again. As I always say everyone's taste is different. Just as my review might be bad a lot of others say the food is good so nothing personal."}
{"text":"BBQ was so-so. The baby back ribs were tender. hush pups were good. Fried pickles did not have much flavor.  Unfortunately, the brisket was cut incorrectly making it not nearly as enjoyable to eat"}
{"text":"We have lived in North Carolina for four years now and have never experienced a delicious BBQ.......until today!!!!!! I found Bobbee O's BBQ thru Google and my husband and I went to check it out! - it's located in a strip mall and if your not looking, you'll pass it. The inside is small with two tables and bar with several stools and about three tables outside. You order at the counter to either dine in or take out. There's a huge window to watch them prepare your food.  I got the BBQ chicken with green beans and coleslaw.....it was so delicious, I savored EVERY bite. My husband got the ribs and pulled pork. The ribs fell right off the bone and were absolutely delicious. The pulled pork was moist and cooked to perfection.  This place is truly a diamond in the rough and if us two tough northern natives enjoyed this, you most likely will too!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place as we were traveling through Charlotte back to Ohio. We are glad we stopped! We had the pulled pork and brisket along with fries and Mac and cheese. The Brisket by far was the star. Pulled pork was a close second. We initially ordered a family style Mac and cheese but they compensated us and made up for the mistake. It was so good we even ordered sandwiches to go so we had something for the road! You have to check this place out. Definitely a hole in the wall feel, but those are always the most authentic!"}
{"text":"I'd give a Negative 5 if I could. BBQ sucks then asked for extra bbq sauce the old guy wanted to charge extra, I was like dude my company just spent 200 bucks and you want to be a cheap ass... needless to say I left tried bbq but didn't buy and the Mac and cheese is nasty freaking onions really . Don't waste your time or money. Morons"}
{"text":"Fantastic!   The staff was SO friendly and the food was amazing! Check out the pulled pork sandwich. Great prices too.  Be sure to put a pin on the wall for your home town. :)"}
{"text":"I am moving to California tomorrow. Had to stop by for one more dinner before I left.   As usual Bobbee was there with a friendly word. I had the brisket dinner which also as usual was terrific.   Not only will I miss the fantastic Q and the always friendly and efficient service, in addition I will miss Bobbee's  amazing sauce. So as the solution to this dilemma, I bought a case of it to take with me!  12 bottles should last me a while.  Thanks for everything Bobbee."}
{"text":"I was a regular at the old location.  But I moved away about two years ago. I loved their sauce so much, I bought a full case to take with me when I left. Unfortunately, those twelve bottles were long gone.   Fast forward to this past weekend.  I was in town to visit and of course needed a Bobbee O's fix. I went to the old location and of course saw they were gone. A quick lookup on yelp got me to the new spot east enough. Same terrific Q. Same amazing sauce.  Same outstanding service.  BUT a new, comfortable, eat in restaurant!  I was very impressed.  I had the brisket and as usual, it was melt in your mouth tender.  I needed to reload on my personal stock of sauce but alas, they were out!!  Oh no!  But not to worry. The very friendly and helpful manager told me more would be in on Monday. She took my name and promised to call me when it was available. Sure enough, the call came Monday afternoon as promised.  So this time I bought TWO cases!  A former colleague picked it up and shipped to me. Now I should be set for a while. YUM!  Thanks Bobbee and staff!"}
{"text":"We headed in to Bobbee O's with a Groupon in hand on a quiet Saturday night. I had read from previous reviews that the place had limited seating, no AC, and mediocre sides so we decided to just spend all our cash on meat and bring it home with us.   Bobbee O's is a bit challenging to find, and even more tricky to locate the parking area. Bobbee O's is attached to a few other strip stores, so it definitely blends in and doesn't stand out. The inside is very tiny, with two small tables and a small standing/stool area if you want to eat inside. Not that you would, since it's cramped and without any AC it's pretty dang hot in there (especially with the heat from the semi-open kitchens right there too.) But don't let the ambiance fool you...the 'Q is pretty dang tastetacular.  We ordered half a rack of babyback ribs and a whole bbq chicken, most of which was covered by our Groupon. The guy running the register and getting our food was pretty friendly, and we only waited a few minutes until our meat was ready for the trip home.  The ribs were simply fantastic, and almost everything that bbq ribs should be. The meat was extremely tender and had that fall off the bone quality you come to expect from babybacks.The real kicker is the sauce...IT IS AMAZING!!! Being a Yankee transplant, I haven't fully fallen in love with Carolina's vinegar-based sauces yet, and prefer my sauces to be thicker and sweeter. Bobbee O has got that down pat with a great sauce that is a bit thick, a tad beet sweet, AND has a touch of heat to it. That heat is what sealed the deal for me. You don't taste it too much as you eat it, but after a couple of minutes you will start to feel a slight tingle on your lips from the residual sauce heat doing its thing. The one thing that the ribs lacked were any smoked flavoring. I like to be able to taste that smokeyness when I bite into bbq meats, and these ribs were just missing that little something.  Now it doesn't happen often, but I preferred the chicken to the pork! The bbq chicken was a full chicken split in half, so I got the tasty legs and thighs and the miss' got the white breast meat she prefers. I found the flavor of the chicken to be a tad smokier than the pork, and the sauce really complimented the chicken. It was super moist and the chicken pulled right off the bone, which made it very easy to split between us.   Bobbee O's is a bit of a hike for us to grab meat and then bring it home, but it will be a tempting thought. While the meat wasn't the best I would like it to be, the sauce more than makes up for it. Heck, I'm might even go back there one day just to snag a couple of bottles of sauce! Perhaps next time I might give some of the sides a whirl, though based on other reviews here I'm not missing much. Bobbee O's is definitely a solid bbq meat center, and I would be returning more often if it was closer to where I live in Huntersville. I would just recommend getting the food to go since the interior doesn't make for the most comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"Supple, moist pulled pork paired with a sauce that has a perfect touch of chili flake heat.  A must try.  No frills, great bbq : O )"}
{"text":"No frills, no gimmicks, no fancy decor or clever catchphrases. Bobby O's is all business, all BBQ.   This isn't a traditional NC BBQ joint, more like a fusion of good ole American BBQ. While they do have some traditional southern sides, I can't say they were anything to rave about. They use penne for the mac which wasn't all that great and collards were just eh, okay.   Now, onto the good stuff. Pulled Pork was actually tasty. Most places just have pork that is well, bland and relies on sauce. This pork actually had some flavor. Brisket was pretty good. So good that I actually ate the fat. It was rendered so well that it melted in my mouth like butter pecan ice cream. I've never been a fan of smoked chicken. Chicken is usually not fatty enough to smoke so it dries out fast. While this chicken wasn't super moist, it wasn't turkey jerky dry either. When it comes to ribs, they offer two kinds. Baby back and St Louis (spare rib). Both are tasty, but I always prefer baby back.   Lastly, they have their own sauce. As far as I could tell, they only offer one sauce. Not your traditional Eastern Carolina vinegar based, but a spicy oh I dunno, St Louis style tomato based sauce.   All in all, not too shabby. If you're up north and looking for a new smokehouse, give Bobby's a try."}
{"text":"Followed yelpers advice and tried this place. Drove right past it, bad entryway and hard to find. The place was very clean and rating on wall was 99.0(always important to me). Owner waited on me and was very polite as didn't know what I wanted, this place has 2 small tables so plan on takeout. Ordered a pork sandwich and mac and cheese for wife, she loved the sandwich alot, thought the mac with onions in it didn't satisfy her cheesy need.], but at $4.99 including a drink was a bargain. I ordered the combo of pork and baby back ribs, got coleslaw with mine. Baby backs were too fatty, but I loved the pork and coleslaw was outstanding. The sauce they give you for the pork was very good, wished I had more. I'll go back and for sure get the pork and beef brisket combo next time at $8.99. People were ordering alot of the chicken, guessing it is good. Try the pork sandwich for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte for the weekend. We were looking for a casual, early supper and decided to visit Bobbee O's. My husband ate a  bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. He loved his meal. My niece and I both ordered pulled pork. The slaw was sweet and milky. The mac and cheese was good because it had onions and extra cheese. The collards were home cooked. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual! I would suggest you stop by if you're in the mood for a great meal!"}
{"text":"My expectations were high and maybe too high. After reading all the reviews, I just knew that I was going to love this place.  We ordered a family meal with the St. Louis ribs with sides of mac and cheese, fries, and cabbage. We also ordered a pound of beef brisket, side of sweet potato fries, 3 chicken wings and a hot link sandwich.  Hands down the best things we ate were the French fries and chicken wings.   St. Louis Ribs -  Ribs were tender but lacked that good bbq flavor you desire when eating bbq. Our guess is that are cooked first on a grill and then finished in the oven.   Brisket- Just okay. Not great but better than the ribs. Could be more tender. Again lacking flavor.  Hot Link Sandwich - No snap when eating the hot link. Not even that spicy.  Mac & Cheese - if you like mac and cheese that will not taste like mac and cheese then this is for you. It tasted like celery, onions or something. Whatever they added overpowered the taste of cheese and that familiarity of mac and cheese.  Cabbage - Okay. Blah.   Sweet Potato Fries - frozen and fried variety. Nothing to hate.  French Fries - seasoned, frozen and fried variety. Nothing to hate.  Chicken wings - I just can't believe that the best thing I loved about this place had absolutely nothing to do with BBQ. These wings were banging and almost made me want to give this place a 3 but it is a BBQ joint not a chicken wing joint.   BBQ Sauce- was actually really good. It was a perfect balance of sweet, spicy and smokey. Too bad the bbq wasn't as good as the sauce."}
{"text":"We tried the brisket, fried pickles, sweet potato fries, and macaroni and cheese. Brisket is disappointing; on the edge of going bad, dry, and served in sauce. Portions were short on the brisket as well, despite purchase by the pound. It is split up by volume not exact weight.  Sauce is a good Carolina vinegar with some spice.  The large sides of fried pickles and sweet potato fries are huge. Fried pickles lack in vinegar flavor, bland. Sweet potato fries were normal.  Macaroni and cheese is delicious and more of a casserole, heavy on onions.  Fed 4 with the family meal."}
{"text":"I had ordered from the catering menu for my wife's 44th birthday, but she was sick today,  so I had to reschedule.   Took the kids to dinner anyway...we had the baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and pulled chicken, plus Mac n cheese, Cole slaw and fries.  It was all super tight, especially the pulled pork and ribs.  Bobbee, you've got a new regular."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering food from here. I order food from chow now.   I place my order in at 9:30 and it said it will be ready by 10:35. I had order the family  Brasket meal which comes with 3 sides, option of bread or bun. I got the cabbage, mac n cheese and the onion rings for my sides. I also order the Brasket salad, added on gallon tea , corn bread and order 20 wings. So my total was about 75.   Okay so I sent my hubby to pick up the food, and he was kinda late because of an accident on the highway. So he got there around 10:45. Well when he got home I was missing my gallon tea, and we didn't get any bread with our order. So by this time they are closed, and I had to work the next day so I couldn't call them.   Well I was disappointed that I didn't get my gallon tea.  But lets get to the food part. The Brasket had no flavor at all but it was moist and tender. The wings was good but it was breaded, but my kids liked them. The sides was pretty good.  The Brasket salad was nothing fancy, it really is just brasket on a bed of salad.   Well that's it, maybe I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"This is quality BBQ, no doubt about it.  Best in Charlotte as said in some other reviews?  I don't think so.  That title still goes to Midwood Smokehouse IMO.  I've had Bobbee O's on my bookmark list for over a year and finally was pushed into trying them based on their current appearance in the Final Four of the Charlotte Observer, Munch Madness, BBQ bracket.  First off, the folks working here are very friendly and accommodating.  I was offered a small sample of the pulled pork when they heard it was my first visit which was a nice touch.  Very sparse surroundings as others have noted but that's a definite 'who cares' in my book when it comes to a BBQ place.  In terms of the food, there are so many particular flavor profiles one can run into in the BBQ world.  Bobbee O's lands on the sweet/vinegary side of the spectrum based on the sauce they serve and there is a real dose of heat, in the form of pepper flakes, in the pulled pork.  For me, just a bit too much as the heat overtook the pork itself which is moist, flavorful and without an ounce of fat.  The spareribs were good, tender and meaty although I would order them with no sauce if that's possible as I'm not a real fan of the sweet sauce and they come slathered.  The sides I tried were OK.  The coleslaw was again, too sweet for me and somewhat watery and the Mac N Cheese was tasty but nothing to write home about.    At the end of the day, I would definitely stop in again if in the area and suffering from a Cue craving.  I look forward to trying the brisket on my next visit based on what I have read in other reviews."}
