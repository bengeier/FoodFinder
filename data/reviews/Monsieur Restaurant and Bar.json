{"text":"Three colleagues and I had dinner at Monsieur on Wednesday evening. The food and service were both outstanding.  We talked about the meal all day Thursday.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The wild mushroom gnocchi was perfection! Not to mention the fried calamari with a fresh yogurt and cucumber sauce...so good. I went there for dinner with a couple of friends and all our plates were absolutely beautiful. The environment is very welcoming and stylish, plus the staff was super nice. We chatted with our waiter who gave us great suggestions of places to dance and grab drinks after our meal. I'll will definitely be going back next time I'm in MTL"}
{"text":"Friendly staff comfortable dining atmosphere with a quality stereo system playing popular cover songs I the background. Mon ami et moi had a late evening dinner.  The cuisine was simply elegant:  all freshly made with many locally grown ingredients. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for the burger from Eater's list

Sat at the bar and were promptly served our drinks. 

We ordered a few dishes to share. Everything was good but nothing was extraordinary.  The burger was good but not a stand out."}
{"text":"The menu is authentic French cuisine that offered a diverse array of choices. The shrimp risotto was outstanding along with the filet mignon, which both were cooked to perfection. Our server Kirsten provided superb service! Ask for Kirsten and discover the different in service. If you want excellent French cuisine this is a must place to try."}
{"text":"Came here for a spur of the moment nice dinner while we were in town, and everything was just phenomenal. The butternut squash ravioli starter had us mopping up every last drop and trying not to lick the plate. The salmon tartar was also fantastic. My husband had the risotto and I had the Di Buffala Artisanale salad, which was the perfect dinner salad with its hunk of creamy fresh mozzarella, spinach pesto and arugula. The cocktails and service were great too- would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect little restaurant and bar. We have been here a few times for drinks, light snacks at the bar and dinner at table.  The bartender has created some fun drinks on the menu. All of the staff provide great service. The salads are all wonderful. The marinated olives are a jar full of assorted olives. The scallops were perfectly done and so interesting with puréed and also pickled cauliflower. The homemade ricotta ravioli was delicious. The burger looks intriguing.   We will be back."}
{"text":"We met Chef Max last night while out and he invited us to come to his restaurant the next night. 

OMG!! What an amazing gem you have here in Montreal!! The Beets on Beets on Beets salad was phenomenal and it looked too pretty to eat but boy are we glad we did!! 

The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere inviting. 

Next time we visit Montreal, Monsieur is a sure thing!"}
{"text":"Awesome, quaint and classy place with great service. I got he Risotto of the moment and it was amazing (scallops on top). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had visited this establishment last night to take part in the very popular Poutinefest. Prior to this, I had come once before about a year ago. While the food was delicious, I found the service on my first experience to be terrible (waiter forgot my order, did not bring my friend her drink despite being prompted twice, over 30 minute wait for the bill). Despite all this I decided to give this place another try.

Upon arrival, my friend and i were shown our table. It was a busy night but it took over 20 minutes before anyone came to see us with a menu or water. Actually the only reason someone came was that the waitress mistakenly came to the table with someone else's food! She nicely apologized but gave the reason that her manager said everything was already taken care of (wth?). Complete lack or organization. 

As for the poutine itself, luckily it was the redeeming factor. Nicely seasoned and a good sized portion. It was topped with kale, mushroom gravy, parmesan shavings, fried onions and beef brisket. Licked my plate clean. At least the kitchen knows what they're doing.

Despite the tasty food, i don't think i'll come back again. While the staff is friendly, their organization is shoddy and it dampens the dining experience."}
{"text":"We hesitated for only a moment to go- since there were not many reviews. I am SO happy it was only a moment and we went in for dinner. 
The food and the service was amazing. 
We were able to be seated without a reservation- however, if possible- I would recommend since the place filled up quickly. 
The grilled octopus was amazing. My risotto was insane. The burger incredible. I really can't say enough good things. 
Cheers! Amazing food AND staff!

{"text":"During our first visit to Montreal we happened on to a wonderful restaurant for lunch. It was packed with local business people, but we were able to sit at the bar. Our lunches, and the wine recommended by the manager/bar tender, were excellent. The good food, plus the friendly and attentive service, enticed us to return the following evening for dinner.  Once again, our meals were delicious and we were treated like returning friends. Monsieur Restaurant was truly a lucky find!"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food as I only came here for drinks - it's a spot near my hotel that's open past 9pm! The Tito's dirty martinis were made well. Service was a little slow. Place was fairly busy on a Tuesday night"}
{"text":"Very nice place a little chic but you dont have to be. I went on week night it was not to buzy the ambiance was perfect for date night. 
The service was very good and we where offered the choice of flat or sparkling water as we where seated

Food:
We started by sharing the calamary apetizer. It was delicious the light breading was brilliantly seasoned and crispy on each piece. The calamary was tender and not chewy and the yogurt cucumber sauce was a perfect match. The portion was also much more reasonable than most other restaurant and was enough to share. 
My partner had the salmon tartare which she enjoyed very much and I had the risotto du jour : parsnip asparagus mushrooms and shrimp. All the ingredients where obviously fresh and cooked to perfection. 
The portion where resonable leaving us with room for desert. 
We chose the carrot cake and the double chocolat brownie and got our 1st disapointment of the evening. 
Both plate came with the same garnish of fresh berry with whipped cream and a slather of caramel. Personaly i prefer that my garnish is tailors to my dish (yes even for desert). The carrot was delicious moist and flavourful. The brownies was a different story it was more like a pound cake than a browny and I dont know why they called it double chocolat. 
I would definitely go again but I'd skip desert"}
{"text":"Nice upscale restaurant with some modern touches. Friendly staff, very attentive. Food was very good. Had a filet mignon and my wife the pesto risotto. Both were very tasty. Drinks and wine list were also good. A bit pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"We were planning to eat oysters at Notkins but magically we come in to Monsieur by mistake. But the food here is amazing. My friend and I both ordered grilled salmon. The salmon is so fresh. The rice is good too. I will try burgers next time."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this place
I had a very tasty salmon entree. Nice piece of salmon sitting on veggie purée with different veggies on the side 
My friend had the lamb. It's a generous portion of lamb shank sitting on a sweet potato purée. 
I thought that lamb was ok but the salmon was exquisite. 
Prices are ok (around 20$ per plate) 
I wasn't really full at the end of my meal but I have a big appetite so don't mind me. 
We shared the brownie as a desert and it was everything a brownie should be: moist and rich"}
{"text":"So delicious! This was the best gnocchi I've ever had (I mean ever)  and the mussels were incredibly flavorful, too. The place has a nice, chill ambiance (& extra bonus points to the lovely staff for being so generous in accommodating us with our infant daughter)."}
{"text":"Wonderful resturant. Spicy mussels that are fresh. Enjoyed their Carpaccio appetizer. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I went to Monsieur Resto & Bar enticed in by their MC Verde Poutine and my friend and I were very impressed with their Poutine week offering!  It was elegant, delicate yet very satisfying.  10/10 Kudos to the chef who created this delightful piece.  I could have it every day of the week."}
{"text":"Solid lunch for a medium sized group today. Delicious food and great service. Bright, beautiful, clean restaurant.

To start they brought us shot glasses of some yummy tomato soup. I really enjoyed my main, the vegetarian salad.

The odd quirk was that several at the table had ordered the mixed grill and the cod was replaced by a different fish (a different color, so noticeable) and they didn't mention that there would be or that there was a substitution."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because it was close to the place we were staying.  It was a delightful non-rushed evening with great cocktails and superb food.  The ambiance was casual and the music was a perfect backdrop to conversation.  Our servers were attentive and helpful in making choices.  The salad was fresh and plenty for both of us. I had filet mignon cooked to perfection and my partner had the catch of the day, a perfectly cooked salmon with fresh vegetables.  Ask your server about their new lemonade cocktail with infused jalapeños syrup.  It was amazing.  All in all, a perfect evening and we recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Superb lunch spot! The salmon dish was very well executed; lots of flavour, with delicious vegetables and purée, which add to a nice overall texture for the dish. Great presentation in a casual yet stylish environment. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! My friend and I happened to pass by on our way to Old Port and I spotted this place. The interior design and food grabbed my attention and so I dragged my friend into the restaurant with me. The food was spot on!! I ordered the mushroom risotto, it was rich and creamy but not too overwhelming. At first I thought the portion was a bit small, but then it turned out to be perfect. The creme brulee was also pretty good (: Also, they had a couple of pretty cool art pieces on the walls, the one that caught my attention was this monopoly pop art painting. All I can say is it's definitely a chique little spot to visit if you ever visit Montreal. Food and atmosphere were great. Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Super fresh raw bar and lovely wine list. Everything we saw being prepared was meticulous. Cannot recommend it more highly. The have a great subtle DJ and the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Went here for a drink while I sifted through emails (using their free wifi) and was blown away by the attention and quality of this place! Not a great view from window but the restaurant itself is good to look at."}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. We ended up coming twice during our four day trip to Montreal. The food, drinks, ambiance are all excellent, but what sets it apart is the staff. So welcoming, you immediately feel like you're part of a family. We felt like we were going to an old friend's house for dinner."}
{"text":"What a find!  We were craving oysters and needed a place close to the Courtyard Marriott Downtown.  We walked out the entrance to the hotel and directly across was Monsieur Restaurant.  We were greeted by a cheerful young gentlemen and seated immediately.  The ambience was a modern twist on farm to table.  

The food was the star, the oysters were fresh served with a red wine vinegar.  We has steak which was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth.  As well as the stuffed chicken which was tender, juicy with a delightful stuffing.  The veggie that was served with the dishes was fresh and seasoned to enhance their natural flavors.

We will return on our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. English speaking even if you don't speak French. We had the chicken soup, risotto and the linguine with mussels. The soup had a deep broth flavor with nice cubes of vegis and chicken. But the highlight was the risotto and the linguine.
The risotto was really rich and tasty. It had mushrooms, asparagus and spinach. Super creamy and cheesey. The portion they served you was just right.
The linguine with mussels was also a great dish. The mussels were fresh as well as the linguine. Just a touch of cream in the sauce but you could really taste the brine from the mussels.
Would return again if we ever make it back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but good service and good food. The drinks are pricey but worth it. I had the risotto of the day and it was on a scale of 1 to 10 a 9, very good and priced accordingly. My husband order the filet and it was also good but more of an 8 out of 10. We liked the atmosphere since it is just the 2 of of us it was easy to talk. I would highly recommend and would definitely return."}
{"text":"The girls and I went for boozy brunch on Sunday. I had the fried chicken and waffles. Honestly it was dry. :( I wish the chicken was juicier and I wish there was more sauce on the waffles. I liked the chili that was cut up because I liked the sweet salty spicy combo. I took a bite of my friend's sandwich and the taco and they were good. The best part of the experience was definitely the vibe and the bottomless mimosas! Everyone was having such a great time and Shaharah and her band were amazing!"}
{"text":"Bistro sympa dans le Quartier International! J'ai découvert ce petit restaurant/bar principalement grâce à la ''Semaine de la poutine'' à Montréal et je pense bien y retourner un jour pour essayer d'autre chose. Donc, leur poutine Monsieur C.Verde créée spécialement pour l'événement était bonne mais sans plus, pas assez de chorizo à mon goût... Les ''calmars frits'' (12$) étaient bons mais le meilleur plat pour moi fut les ''pappardelles au ragoût de champignons sauvages'' (23$).  Menu varié de ''os à la moelle'' à la ''salade d'endives'' en passant par le ''tartare de saumon'' ou encore le ''jarret d'agneau''. Carte de vin variées. Prix corrects moyens. Très bon service de la serveuse, toujours là pour s'assurer que tout aller bien, eau+vin+pain, rien à redire. Belle décoration simple et moderne. J'y reviendrai sûrement pour essayer pour sûr. 4/5 Visité en février 2015."}
{"text":"great dinner. perfectly cooked with great flavor, nice wine selection. quiet and romantic dinner. worth a try. crispy calamari with a yogurt sauce, unexpected combination and so good. the scallops with pickled cauliflower,  cauliflower puree and pancetta- so good - all of the flavors and combination perfect together. halibut special and gnocchi did not disappoint.  the carrot cake was dense and moist. great dinner overall"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the great finds in Montreal.  Our reservation was for 4, then 6, then 2 more showed up unexpected!   Kirsten, our server, is amazing.  Nothing fazed her and every request of ours was met with a genuine smile.  Our entire group LOVED the food and the service.  Great wine selection, too. Bravo to Kirsten and the entire staff."}
{"text":"Wanted someplace mellow,  very close to the hotel, not touristy or a traditional heavy meat, fat and butter place, but rather more of a lighter fare, contemporary bistro with roots in local cuisine.  This place hit the spot.  

Maybe 15 tables, very friendly professional staff.  Food comes out steaming hot and fresh.  Generous portions and reasonably priced for the quality. 

The stuffed Jalapeño with panko breadcrumb and herb crust was very tasty.  I thought the batter on the Fish and Chips was a little thick for my taste but I'm very particular and batter preferences are very personal.  The hand cut fries were excellent."}
{"text":"Place is cute. I was kind of torn rating Monsieur Restaurant. Food was amazing, both the Octopus and the Risotto were very tasty. Service on the other hand was a mess..."}
