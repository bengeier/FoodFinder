{"text":"There is no better gyro then the special gyro at Kyklos with feta cheese on a warm pita. The service is friendly. Ask for samples."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but a great experience every time I have been here. The food is authentic, delicious, and reasonable priced. The care given to making this food is evident in the quality. Don't let the fact it is in a mall food court fool you, you will be blown away."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for roughly 10 years. You don't expect much from a mall food court. Kyklos is the exception. The staff has always been incredibly friendly and the food is great. 99% of the time I get the chicken gyro supreme. I've never had a gyro that even comes close.   Give them a chance. Take the entrance that goes directly to the food court. Enjoy.  Protip: if you get a gyro, grab a fork. It gets messy."}
{"text":"The customer service is definitely there. I was given a sample of their chicken before I ordered and everyone was very nice. I went for the chicken gyro supreme so I could have some feta. The gyro was decent but nothing too special. I have had tastier ones. However, they didn't skimp on the filling so no complaints there. Like other reviewers have noted, grab a fork. That thing will fall apart on you. They also gave me a mountain of crinkle fries for my side so I did not leave hungry. All of this plus a drink for about $13. If I'm back in the food court area of the Galleria mall, I may stop again."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken salad is absolutely outstanding. Service is super friendly. Love Kyklos!"}
{"text":"By far the best Greek food Ive ever had. Every bite was just amazing! We had the kyklos euro and it was delicious. We've also had the grilled chicken over rice and that is by far my favorite thing on the menu. The service was just as great as the food itself. And the baklava.. O.M.G. I've had baklava from other places but this was is just the best baklava I've ever had in my life. It tastes homemade soooo fresh! Can't rave enough about this place. I love it!"}
{"text":"Awesome best food ever In the mall. Wish they had another place on the north west side of town."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the mall I have to grab a bite to eat from these guys.THEY ROCK!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, this is my first time at the Galleria at Sunset Mall. While in the food court I decided on Greek food for lunch and had the most amazing customer service experience. The staff was sweet, and very appreciative of the service. They answered any questions I had and provided a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"4 stars for the gyro supreme. the salads are good too watch out for the pits in the olives. Almost broke my tooth. Seriously gyro supreme is money"}
{"text":"Hard to get anything else when you are in the mall.  Best Greek food I have found in the Las Vegas Area!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and better customer service.! First time here but deff will not be the last!"}
{"text":"Not bad if you don't mind THE BEST GREEK FOOD IN THE LAS VEGAS VALLEY!!!  Plus the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and actually Greek."}
{"text":"Whenever my family and I go the Galleria Mall, my husband and I always come here and get the Gyro combo with fries!  It's delicious!  The customer service is excellent as well... I can tell the owner (know him by face, not by name) has trained his staff very well to provide excellent customer service like he shows himself."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Greek restaurant - the food is incredible & the staff is super friendly & accommodating. The owner is so appreciative of your business & really makes a point to be thankful that you stopped in to eat there. It's just a genuinely good place to eat with nice people working there. I wish I could give this place 10 stars."}
{"text":"I got the Gyro with everything on it. Very tasty meat and veggies. The wait time was good and their service was great. Bit pricy compared to local take out but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place in the mall to eat.  On Saturday the kid at the register (no name tag) rang me up wrong (over charged me) and couldn't figure out how to fix it on my credit card. After 20 minutes of calling his managers, he couldn't get through to anyone.  I finally just asked for cash back and told him to figure it out with his manager later.  Another example of bad customer service ruining a great place."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town! Excellent customer service, very clean! Love, love, love the food"}
{"text":"Came to the mall for this place because they have the best food!  Great spot very clean and professional!"}
{"text":"This place has been running for a long time!! Every time I eat here I'm never disappointed. They are not stingy with their portions, so come hungry!  Check out their sides menu.. they have plenty of other options... I wish I would've know I could have had Calamari while shopping!! lol"}
{"text":"Fun change from your typical mall's food court selections. We were passing by and glancing at the menu when one of the workers called us over and provided free samples of their chicken. It tasted great, so we ordered the chicken gyro and the kyklos gyro (lamb and beef) with the Greek fries. It came out to $25 which may be a little more expensive than Sbarro pizza or the Japanese grill next door, but the quality of this food far surpassed anything we've ever had in a food court. The workers are very committed to the success of this restaurant and will likely ask you to provide your feedback on Facebook or Yelp, which I am glad to do and would highly recommend anyone else to give them a try."}
{"text":"Ordered a gyro on my lunch break, it was delicious! Was also given a sample of the grilled chicken, delicious as well. Sophocles was very friendly and cool under pressure during lunch rush. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, I know what you're thinking... yes, it is in the mall, but its great!  Family run, authentic food, and plenty of options.  Before becoming a vegetarian, I ordered the chicken gyro supreme plate (same great stuff, but on a plate with rice pilaf instead of wrapped up like a gyro). Now I order the same plate, sans chicken, and add a small greek salad.  I love all of their dressings and sauces, none of that stuff from a bottle here."}
{"text":"Best Greek Food I have found in Vegas, Have been here 2 times in last 2 weeks. Owner is super nice and the food is just awesome. Not your typical fast food, taste better then most Greek restaurants in Vegas at half the price of them."}
{"text":"This is awesome I've been working at the Galleria mall for almost 5 months now and just went there for the first time yesterday. I was skeptical for a while because I thought they only served gyros which I don't like, but I was  mistaken. The variety is amazing. If you're going with kids and they don't like Greek food, theybhave a kids menu with chicken fingers and fries!!  Also the chicken is to die for!  The staff there was so nice, family oriented and not pushy, they we're quick and I was ordered and on my way back to work in 5 min. Really makes a difference with only a 30 minute lunch. I will be returning today to try something new."}
{"text":"Mall location, but definitely above average compared to usual food court type fare. A little on the pricey side though."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times and have always had an enjoyable meal. This time however was very different. I always get the gyro combo which has gone significantly up in price each time I go. They charge extra for feta on your gyro. I think this should come standard for gyro. Then they also charge more if you want feta on your fries. A refill for your drink is a dollar as well.   I ordered my food and went with my boyfriend to get his food. Walked back and my food was done sitting in the back. I had to wait for the next person taking their order to get my food because he was the only person working. This was when I noticed they had two pans sitting on top of each other full of already cooked gyro meat. I immediately knew my meat would not be fresh.   I sat down to eat my meal and the fries were pretty good. They were over cooked but I don't mind crunchy fries. My gyro meat however was very crunchy around the edges because it was thoroughly over cooked and had been sitting out like I thought. The sauce, tomatoes, and onions were good but I was not happy with my meal. Crunchy gyro meat ruined it for me. I will no longer be eating a gyro at the food court. Overpriced and not as tasty as it used to be."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Kyklos. At first I didn't have much in the way of expectation since it was a mall food court. I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a Gyro sandwich and a side of falafel. The sandwich was quite meaty, the sauce was excellent... even the pita was perfectly prepared.  The falafel was perfect.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting a Restaurant quality lunch while shopping the mall."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Very good.  I lived in Greece for a few months and totally enjoyed the food there.  This Kyklos is as close to authenticate as your going to get.  The staff was very nice and polite.  A totally enjoyable experience.  If I had to ding then on anything, it would be that there tziki sauce needs a bit more cucumber in it"}
{"text":"Me and my sister worked in the food court for years when we where kids and I've always witness and experience excellent service from the owners always have smiles and treat every customer like family they are wonderful people now...Lets get to the food the food is the best Greek food I've ever had in my life always full of flavor and hug portion you truly get what you pay truly the best the earn my business and 5 stars"}
{"text":"The best Gyros in town! The owner is very accommodating and polite.  I bee line to his stand soon as I get to the mall. I will see him today and be greeted with a loving genuine smile. Nice ;)"}
{"text":"Back for good food after a Matinee....and our meal  comped....for just coming!! Besides the delicious lunch, fantastic service. Whenever we're out this way this is always our first option for chow!"}
{"text":"Words can't describe how great the food is here,to put into prospective I drove from Mt Charleston just to eat here,customer service was excellent and food came out very fast one gentleman in particular named Sophocles frangakis which if I'm not mistaken is the owner is in person working hard with his employees,awesome man and awesome place"}
{"text":"So I went back and it was once again good, I can't say great because the land was a little well done but that tzatziki  was delicious"}
{"text":"I love this spot. The best gyros in the world. I'll definitely be back for more!!! Friendly staff and awesome food :)"}
{"text":"Thanks so much Soph and team you really made our goodbye party really special for our departing assitant manager at Sweet Factory! You had the food ready in a timely fashion and went above and beyond for us! Thanks so much for a incredibly grateful Sweet Factory store"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a shopping mall food venue, but I really have to share. This place has the very best gyros, cous cous, and baklava. Chicken, or lamb with the works is amazing. The price is worth the quality, and quantity. http://www.kyklosgreekcafe.com"}
{"text":"My family has been going there since 2003. The service and food is always great!!! Best Greek Restaurant of the West Coast!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid. Honestly some of the best quality gyros I've ever had. Their salads and fries are also amazing. Everything here is good. You should stop by for lunch even if you're not coming to the mall!!"}
{"text":"The first post I wrote was not positive. But to my surprise I received a response from the son of the owner (I apologize for forgetting your name)almost immediately. He informed me of the circumstances behind our \"not so great food or service\" and proceeded to apologize...asking us to please give them another chance and how much he appreciated our business. WOW! Now that's customer service. So my husband and I returned again for lunch...and we were not disappointed. Everything we had was AWESOME. And MOM was a gem. Thank you for caring. And because of that we will return again and again."}
{"text":"Very good food, I really liked it. I ordered chicken gyro and baklava.  Prices are reasonable and customer service is good."}
{"text":"They always greet you with a smile and the food never fails to be great!!! Always a job well done"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, everyone looks happy to help you. Food was delicious! I had a gyro and if was super stuffed, they don't skimp out on anything."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on yelp reviews and it's really good.  Chicken gyro wrap with tabbouleh on the side.  The only reason I held back a star is I prefer lavash over pita for my wraps.  Surprisingly good for a food court.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"clean neat and organized.  Good Value..."}
{"text":"First time trying kyklos and definitely will be back ! I got the chicken gyro and it was very yummy and fresh cooked right infront of you being that its in a mall food court it doesnt get all the attention as your common food court foods but if you're looking for something new to try it's definitely worth it good portions and great taste and everyone i spoke to was friendly! Thanks again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service goes a long way....when a girl wants Greek she wants Greek .. brilliantly done....Gyro Fries made my soul happy"}
{"text":"For my 200th review, wow!  I am reviewing an amazing Greek gyro place.    About a decade ago, I started coming to Kyklos where I met an awesome & wholesome Greek family who ran this place.  Three brothers.  The menu even had.  Picture of them as babies to now.  It was so sweet.    It is located in the food court, but their food is so much more than just a 'fast food' food court stop.  It should be in its own building as a Greek restaurant!  The gyro, hummus, baklava, Dolomites, & so much more are the BEST!  I promise you so.    The meat is so fresh & so is the pita.  Everything is.    I took one star off cause the young man working for them this morning was very rude.  I even told him that I knew the family very well & he still was rude.  Wake up kid.  Put a smile on your face."}
{"text":"This is a MUST stop for lunch when I am at the Galleria Mall.  The best gyros I've ever had...packed full of meat and the sauce is the best also!  Greek fries are great and baklava is off the chain!  The brothers who own the joint have amazing personalities and it shows through to the employees also.  I don't get to go here that often since I live on the other side of the city now but when I do they still recognize me and catch up!  It's great...definitely a highly recommended place for me!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is awesome and the staff is the best. If you find your self in Henderson at the Galleria Mall definitely try it and I'm sure you will agree."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious and I recommend anyone who's willing to try new things to try it out. Don't knock it til you try it. The girl who helped with our order was named Destiny. She was a wonderful person to talk to and she shows great work ethics."}
{"text":"There are many places in Vegas to get Greek food, and you can get gyros and falafel at any middle eastern hole in the wall.  But you can't get quality like this anywhere else.  Yes, it's in a mall, but it's worth braving the mall rats.  We love this place, and we make the trip to Henderson whenever we're hungry for the good stuff."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of Gyros however this place is an exception. They make their Gyros right and they don't over-complicate things, and the service is excellent and the flavor is on point"}
{"text":"Working in the mall can make it hard to find tasty, healthy options in the food court.  And I love it here!  So many great options!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Attentive, caring, friendly, personable.   You just can't beat good food and great service !"}
{"text":"I just found this place last month and have already eaten there 8 times! They have a very extensive menu that has a lot of traditional Greek food that you don't see at most places that call themselves \"Greek\" restaurants. I'm not a big fan of baklava, but their home made baklava is very good and I've ordered the 4-pack for $9.95 twice so far. The second time I ate all 4 that night after the gyro I ordered for dinner lol! Their gyros are good size and are big enough to fill you up for lunch or dinner, and the meat-to-bread ratio is VERY good. It's strange that the most authentic and great tasting Greek food I've had in Vegas is in a mall's food court, and not at any stand-alone restaurants. I'd attribute that to the owner who I've talked to who prides himself in making and serving the best Greek food around!"}
{"text":"We always get the gyros salad and the spanakopita. Great value for the food. Portions are large and the food taste great. Not what you would expect at a mall. But you've got to try it. The owners (family owned) are extremely friendly and have a great memory...they remember you each time you visit."}
{"text":"I decided to give Kyklos a second chance...and the food was impressive.  They definitely know what they are doing.  I had the chicken gyro with a side of rice pilaf.  Everything added up to be about $11 which seems to be pretty standard.  Definitely applaud the owner for taking pride in his business while at the same time producing a quality product.  The Greek food here is on par with some table service Greek restaurants."}
{"text":"Let me just say....Mall Food. Its not my favorite. Do you want little Italy, or do you want broke down China? Or, maybe processed meat on a stick, dipped in batter and deep fried? Mall food has not made it to the list of my favorite places to eat, until now.  Kyklos (kee-klos) is fresh, tasty and has the best customer service. You can find Kyklos in the Food Court of the Galleria Mall.  The nice guy behind the counter greets all customers with a fresh hot sample of their Grilled Chicken. (my favorite of course). You can get it over rice, in a gyro or in a salad."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Galleria mall, I bring my appetite for Kyklo's! The owner and his staff are so nice and thankful for your business. Always a fresh, wonderful greek meal. The vegetarian gyro and vegetarian plate are my favorites. The baklava, pita, and hummus are all 5 stars. Good prices too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for years, you wouldn't think much of a Greek place in the food court of a mall. This is some of the best food I have ever eaten. The owner is there daily and is extremely passionate about his business. Customer service is crazy good. 10/10."}
{"text":"We were helped by one of the co-owner Sophocles, nice guy. Honey got the Gyro Combo - Includes: Kyklos Gyro, Regular Fries, and a Large Drink - $9.95 and I got the Chicken Gyros - $7.25.  I was looking for some garlic sauce, I don't think the store actually have some, but give us some Tzatziki for free.  Chicken by itself are delicious, once mix it with lot of Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Yogurt.   taste is more mellow.  The Gyro is ok, I like those at Filfila Mediterranean Cafe better.  Fries are crunchy and fresh.  will go there again since I got a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com for $2 (min. purchase $35)."}
{"text":"Impeccable. Nothing comes close to Greek authenticity like Kyklos. Don't let the fact that it's in a mall food court fool you, this place is an amazing culinary gem that provides fresh, handmade food that would rival anything found anywhere. To make it even more perfect, the Owner Sophocles is a true gentleman and his staff goes above and beyond when it comes to customer service. Big portions, authentic taste and incredible flavors. Do not pass this up. Kyklos is everything you expect when looking for a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Looked at the reviews and seemed to receive good ratings so I thought I'd give it shot since I like to try new places. Ordered the gyro salad and was not impressed what so ever. I've had better greek salads before and that was just horrible. My salad was full of grease. The lettuce was saturated in grease. Sad to say I threw it out. No thanks!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Greek food! My family is Greek& this comes pretty darn close to my grandma's cooking."}
{"text":"I'm a Greek food eating connoisseur!!! Trust this review...they have pretty good Greek food...but, the prices are just too steep...over $13.00 for a Greek salad with no pita bread?? Again, not taking anything away from this establishment but, I prefer the Great Greek that's less than miles away."}
{"text":"The staff the last few times i have been in is warm, and friendly. The cooks every once in a while join in on the conversation  while i wait for my food.   It is a little bit on the pricey side, $11 for a meal, but it is a generous  portion. The meat is tender, and the flavor seems to have improved each time.    The gyro still falls apart on me, so, i definitely recommend a fork."}
{"text":"After walking the food court a bit we were approached by a worker at Kyklos Cafe and he offered samples even though we hadn't approached the counter yet. Made excellent customer service as well as personal preference on meals and introduced me to the gyro meat! Would definitely recommend coming here to try it out."}
{"text":"Best in town, been coming here for years! The owner is super friendly and his staff is top noch. yes it can be a bit pricey and I've seen the prices change over the years but it's worth every penny. They use high quality ingredient so the food is always superb."}
{"text":"Came here during a rush on a Saturday afternoon, and hey were amazing. During the rush, none of the employees just frustrated or overwhelmed which can easily happen. You know how sometimes restaurants get in a rush and fall behind on prepping the food so they skim orders? Kyklos does NOT do that. The order was large enough to share and seriously tasted amazing. Maybe it's because I've never had Greek Food before, but my taste buds were crazy (which may have caused me to super stuff myself and roll out of the mall). Their food is a must try, AND they give free samples of the meat which super hooked me because I knew I needed it the moment I tasted their Gyro meat. Which by the way, holy crap so good! I ordered the gyro fries and it was definitely a treat. So good to see real food in a mall food court."}
{"text":"I am visiting from California, and we went to the mall to do some shopping and get out of the heat. We decided to get some food for the kids and they love hummus with pita bread. My sister went and got some from Kyklos so the kids could start with some food. They loved it!! Since a 3 year old and an 18 month old were loving the food, I figured I could give it a try.   I decided to check into a few more small items. I met the two guys behind the counter and they were wonderful! Their attitudes were great and happy! It was so nice to see! I ended up getting 1/2 piece of spanikopedia, small salad with amazing chicken, and hummus with extra pitas (for my niece and nephew). The food was SO GOOD! I just had to post a review. This place has great food!!"}
{"text":"Man do I love eating here. We do not spend a great deal of time on this side of the valley but when we do, Kyklos it is. I always get the chicken souvlaki, takes about 8 minutes but worth it every time.  My girl gets a Greek salad add chicken (huge) and loves it. Staff is always wonderful,  an experience to share."}
{"text":"Not your typical fast food court establishment.  The food is restaurant quality!  Stingy with the napkins though lol."}
{"text":"My wife and I were Christmas shopping at the Galleria mall and were famished. After looking at all the other eatery's in the food court, we found Kyklos Cafe. We looked, unshure, at the menu. One of the employees (possibly the owner) asked us if we had ever been there before and we replied, \"No!\" He offered us samplings of the meat in the gyros and it was delicious so we ordered two chicken gyros. After waiting for it to be freshly made and watching another employee cut up the fresh tomatoes, we were quickly served. They were very good! Just writing this reveiw is making my mouth water!! The staff was very courteous and after getting through half the gyro, we dicided to try the baklava. We ordered two peices and was served right away, It was also very good.  They have a drink fountain for free refills and also a wing sauce for those that like the heat. We were even thanked after we ate and asked how it was. The only down side of this experience was that it was so good, I was compelled to write a reveiw...which takes time and effort......"}
{"text":"Even though I never come to the mall, I will for one reason and one reason only, the fact that this place has the best gyros in Vegas hands down. When I look around at the mall food court and see people eating elsewhere I just shake my head at them. I've been coming here for several years and Kyklos is consistently good and their customer service is unparalleled. Plus why would you want to support a corporate chain over a family owned business (granted it is in a mall after all). I just usually get the gyro supreme and if I'm feeling extra gluttonous a baklava on top. I've had a couple other items and it's all uniformly as good."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best Greek food I've ever had.  I've tried many other resteraunt in town over a 4 or 5 year period and nobody gets close. I love the gyros and the tabbouleh salad to die for.  I've been going here for years the owner has a real passion for customer service and so do the people that work for him.   5 stars because this is my favorite Greek resteraunt in the city."}
{"text":"Are the gyros good? Yes! Have I had better? Yes!   I had been wanting to try their food for a while now. I haven't had a chance to sample everything on their menu so I'm only going off of what I did order. The price is fair, compared to other Greek restaurants we've been to, it's a steal! Before we placed our order, the nice gentleman let us sample the chicken meat they use for the gyros, it had a good flavor and it wasn't bland.My husband and I decided to go with the beef/lamb gyro combo in the end.  We received our order with fries. They were nice and crispy but just plain. I am not sure if they offer Greek fries but next time I will look and substitute them in if they do. On to the gyro, it came topped with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and feta cheese.I felt like the gyro was missing tzaziki sauce, either that or the sauce was weak, I couldn't taste it. We asked for no onions on both gyros but voila! Onions on both, yuck! Now for the tomatoes, I have a weird relationship with tomatoes, if they look fresh I'll eat them, if they look old they make me feel nauseous on cue, I can't eat them. In this case, they looked old so I picked them all out. Overall, the gyro was good but not great. The cashiers were friendly and helpful, they answered questions in regards to the menu, I will be back though, I am curious about their tyropita."}
{"text":"Yes this place is in the mall food court.  You would never guess you'd find a place like this at the mall.  The staff is really nice and helpful.  If you're not sure what you want, they'll help you decide.  This place has really good Greek food and is reasonably priced.  Next time you're at the mall, avoid the chain fast food joints and check this place out."}
{"text":"I started coming to Kyklos a few years back and at that time I really didn't enjoy greek food. This place totally changed my perception on greek food, especially gyros. It's located in mall food court but that doesn't take away from how amazing the food is. The gyro supreme is what I always get, even though I tell myself every time that I will get something different. The quality in the food or service does't change, it's always been top notch. The prices have gone up, but that hasn't stopped me from going there at least once a month. The food is amazing and I will continue to come here and enjoy the food they offer. My only wish is that they'd expand their business to the northern side of Vegas."}
{"text":"I love eating at Kyklos. My favorite is the grilled chicked salad. I don't know what they put in the dressing but I find myself craving it at weird hours of the day and night.   The owner (Soph) seems to always be there and the love he puts into the food is also shown in the way he treats everyone of his customers. Great guy!  My daughter loves the supreme gyro and I have to admit, so do I.  Wish they would open a nice sit down restaurant. I think the good quality and service would make it successful."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years but I only recently started this yelp thing so I had to come here and show my love for this place! The food is authentic, the staff is amazing and friendly and the owner really has a passion for what he's doing. If you haven't already, you NEED to eat here!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to review this place!! :-) I have got to let readers know that this place blows me away every time. Everyone is so friendly! Every person there is always eager to offer you samples, food choices, good combos or any other info. I work at the mall and whenever I have the opportunity to buy lunch, I make it a point to come here. The food is always cooked fresh. Nothing ever tastes greasy or quickly made. Their food truly tastes like it was made with love.   Anything is good, but I recommend the tomato soup, egg lemon rice soup or the tiropita! A good combo is the tomato soup with the tiropita :-)"}
{"text":"This just might be my favorite place to eat of ALL TIME. Seriously the food is so amazing, it brings a tear to mighty Zeus' eye. I imagine this to be what the heroes of old eat in the Elysian Islands. As one other reviewer said, I'm not entirely sure how close this is to authentic Greek food, but when the owners' names are Sophocles, Constantine, and Yiannis Frangakis, I'm pretty sure they know what they're doing. When I'm at the mall, I love that it's there. When I'm not at the mall, I wish it were a stand alone restaurant. I no longer live in Henderson, but I would travel from Mount Olympus itself to savor these delicious morsels."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 11 years and it has always been amazing food made by amazing people. Sophocles and his staff are the best in town. I am moving out of state and tonight when my wife and I were deciding where we wanted to have our last date night meal together in Las Vegas, it was an easy decision. We knew we wanted to have Kyklos and just as always, not only did it not disappoint but they exceeded our expectations. In our plans to move I have been looking forward to the exciting new opportunities and had few things that will I genuinely miss about Las Vegas but I can honestly say I will greatly miss Kyklos great food and Sophocles and his friendly staff. Anytime we come back to visit this will be number 1 on our list to visit. If you want the best Greek food definitely try Kyklos!"}
{"text":"Y'know, I have to admit that I'm a little sentimental about this place. I worked in the mall when I was 17-18, so my first exposure to their food was during a lunch break. I was a naive, eager little foodie in the makings, so I'd debate between the sushi/grill place or this one. The chicken here was always coated with a flavorful marinade and the employees were happy to hand me a little toothpick sample of goodness to entice me. Several times I talked with the owner, who was pleasant and seemed excited to be sharing his goods. The sandwiches are big; too big for my teenage self to demolish and still probably bigger than I should attempt now.  You can get fries, or salad, or an assortment of other things. There's a pretty decent selection for how big their operating space is.  There's some serious competition that's even closer to our home base, so my patronage here will be limited. The food is good, though, especially given that it's in a mall food court. Don't hate, gryo-nate!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to quickly grab yourself a Gyro!! Their service is exceptional and the staff is so funny."}
{"text":"The service was really nice, they were so patient and positive when figuring out my friends groupon. The spinach pie was really hearty and filling, tzadziki.. However you spell it was good but could have used more cucumber. I would go again:)"}
{"text":"Mall food, who would have thought it could be so delicious!   Take away the screaming children, punk-teenagers, and the smell of Abercrombie and insert Kyklos, a delicious hidden treasure within the Galleria Mall's hoppin food court.   Greek eats, gyros, rice and meat plates, enormous salads, and FANTASTIC SERVICE! The chicken gyro was one of the best I've had in a very long time. Most ethnic cuisine leaves me a bit weary when it comes to meats, especially chicken. But! Kyklos serves recognizable, lean meats served with tasty Greek sides.   If you are in the area, in the mood for Greek, give Kyklos a try! This joint is definitely a healthy and delicious option and one of the Mall's most redeeming food court qualities :)"}
{"text":"If you know me - I loves my greek - this place makes the grade in my book!  Traditional greek delights, just the way I like it!  Opa!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were visiting the Galleria Mall and I wasn't remotely interested in eating food court food. So I reluctantly skimmed over the options and I Was passing by  this gentleman offered me a piece of chicken. I took it to be gracious, but to my surprise it was remarkable. I ended up ordering a gyro and it was amazing. My daughter ended up getting one too. When we were eating the gentleman brought us a bowl of a quinoa salad.   My only regret is that I didn't live closer so I could eat there more often. Very hospital and great quality. I recommend giving this place a try, will return."}
{"text":"Love them gyros! Manager knows who his regulars are and gave me a free Greek salad! Thanks bro"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town for gyros. It is the only reason I will go to the mall these days. I am giving them 5 stars even though, 1, the price is way too high. I really wish they were not so expensive and 2, the quantity. They are really skimping on the meat sometimes. For the price that sandwich should be exploding. I will still go though because, well, it is the best!"}
{"text":"This food is bomb! And the service is amazing too. The cooks really know everything about the food they serve and even showed me a special menu for the vegetarian and vegan options! The service was speedy and everyone working was extremely friendly! Shout out to Joel and Jacob for giving us top notch quality experience!"}
{"text":"Oh ma Gawd!!! Have I really never written a review of my favorite Greek place in town!!! Well let me correct that right meow. At the Galleria mall of all places. Been coming here since they opened years ago and will continue to come  to the mall just for this spot. This place has my favorite Gyro sandwich of all time."}
{"text":"This place made my first time having greek food a memorable experience.The greek chicken salad was delicious! Not only was the food tasty but the service was excellent. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek spot in town. The owner Sophocles is awesome. My favorite dish to share with my wife is the gyro fries. They are exceptional!"}
{"text":"\"Ffifth isth maww foog??\" was the first thing that came out of my mouth when I first ate Kyklos.  Ha d my mouth not been full of a delicious chicken gyro, it was have sounded like, \"This is MALL food?\"  I was at work at my mom's salon holding down the front desk when one of the manicurists who was out and about called and asked if I wanted a gyro.  Who is going to be like, \"Nah.  I don't want a gyro.\"  Everyone ALWAYS wants a gyro.  So I told her sure, and get me some hummus too.  She DIDN'T tell me she was getting gyros at the mall.   When I asked her where she went she said, \"Kyklos.\"   \"Where's that?\" I responded.  \"The Galleria.\"  \"Ffifth isth maww foog??\"  See now?  But really, Kyklos is owned by three brothers who are the NICEST people you could meet.  After this I was charged with going there once a week and picking up gyros and I got the best service ever.  Once, I saw someone order some spanikopita that they didn't particularly like.  Upon returning it, he got his money back AND a piece of Baklava, which he later came up raving about.  And MAN have I never had food that good from a mall.  Their gyros, both traditional and chicken, are delicious and they whip up some of the best hummus in town.  Their kabobs are also well marinated and tender.  Kyklos is one of the only reasons I would go to the mall, and one of the only things there that's actually worth being a patron of."}
{"text":"I ate here today when I went to the mall with my granpa.We got a adult chicken finger basket and a child one.For those two and a drink it was about 17 dollars wich is kinda pricy to me.But we dont get it all the time so its ok. Chicken strips adult: You get 4 of them wich is ok becuase they give you a lot of fries.They are very crunchy and yummy,expeshaly diped in ranch! Fries:crispy,hot,potatoy just how fries should be :)   ps;there a bit stingy on ketchup and napkins so you have to ask for extra."}
{"text":"Was going to go to subway for a salad but saw the gyro salad.  Thought hey give it a try.  The lady taking our order was very friendly they were very busy putting order together. The cook was absolutely great with customer service talking to all walking up to the counter to look when we were given our salad he made sure to tell us that the olives had pits   Being from out of town we return the gyro salad was just as great as the first one same great customer service so nice to go to a restaurant time and again and get the great service and food"}
{"text":"After four years of living in the valley and countless trips to Galleria Mall, I finally gave Kyklos a shot after who I'm assuming is the owner, lured me in with a sample of their chicken breast.  Whenever I'm in the food court, I always find myself pondering at the menu, but I've never given it a double take until I tasted the chicken. I was sold on a Chicken Gyro. The chicken breast is seasoned really well and packed with tons of flavor. My gyro was loaded with chicken and completed with the works- Lettuce, onions, Tzatziki, and Feta cheese. I couldn't finish it because I was beginning to get full only halfway through and it started to fall apart at the seams anyway.  The french fries that accompanied my gyro were your average crinkle-cuts and I'm not mad at them for it. Really crispy, just how I like them. Hummus and pita was yummy too!  What makes Kyklos stand out from the rest of the choices in the food court is the customer service. The customer service is excellent! The owner has a passion for what he does and it shows. Prices are a bit more than what you'd expect for something coming from a food court at the mall, but I promise it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"First, off if you are familiar with the Galleria Mall food court, over the years you have seen many changes in restaurants.   Kyklos I believe has been one of the original ones there which says a lot.   Their  food is amazing and fresh.   You might need to wait a few minutes for your food, but well Worth it!  The staff has always been very friendly too!!    I alway love the little card they give you with your order with a little saying on it."}
{"text":"The Spanakopita was excellent.  Most places serve is as a small pastry - but this was done right!    Friendly service - great gyro too.  Looking forward to my next visit to NV."}
{"text":"The owner was so personable and professional.  The food was a little greasy for my taste.  I got a chicken gyro.  I of course needed to try their stuffed grape leaves and they left me disappointed.  I would have preferred the cold version and these were served hot.  The food overall was not bad and I would try it again."}
{"text":"Gentle eater,    Not one to normally complain about another diner, but Carly seems to have wandered into Sabarro's and fallen into their deep fat fryer. But I digress.  My husband and I came out to Vegas in July of 07 to find housing.  After a long and unsatisfying day, we desperately wandered into the Galleria Mall in search of air conditioning and food. Ugh, mall food. Like I said, desperate.  We wandered aimlessly and were given the only welcome in the court by Sophoclese (sp?) of Kyklos. He let us taste test some of the meat, and we decided to try.  Oh holy mother of goodess.  It was fantastic.  We were reborn! Saved! Kyklos made moving to Vegas actually sound like a good idea!   6 months and a move later, we accidentally found them again. After arguing amongst ourselves as to whether or not this was the same place (we'd been a tad sun-baked the last time, not to mention LOST), we decided to try it again. I should have recognized the exceptional service.  It was even better than I remembered.  This has become a weekly stop for us. We HATE the mall; but we'll go out of our way to take people, visitors, our own family, out to dinner at the mall food court. No one has ever left without being completely satisfied. AND the brothers can discuss Greek history to beat the band. It's so good, I feel I could walk up and say \"make me anything\" and would still enjoy it.   For heavens sakes, try for yourself. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Going to start off saying first! The staff and the owner are all awesome. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. I've been here twice and my favorite thing is the Philly Gyro. I'm not a fan of the traditional gyro sauces. So the philly and fajita style allows me to enjoy the meat with the extra flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price! It's super good and amazingly priced! I recommend the baklava myself, but the meats that they have are out of this world! Go to Devon the manager. He's the best. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have had gyros from Chicago to LA.  This is by far the best I have had.  The staff are great, and the food is excellent!!  There really is no other choice at the food court in the Galleria mall in Henderson.  If you are in the area, check this place out."}
{"text":"When I walked by the owner lured me with a free sample of grilled chicken. It tasted pretty good so I figured why not. I went for the grilled chicken gyro and a Greek salad. It cost me around 12 bucks which is a little steep for the mall food court, but I can say that the food was prepared well. If they were located anywhere other then the mall I would definitely sit down for a meal or two. If your undecided but want quality food this is a good choice."}
{"text":"First off, let me just say I love Greek food, and now let me say this restaurant Kyklos has some of the best Greek food that I've had outside of the island of Crete. The funny thing about this is, when I expressed this to the restaurant manager we realized that the area I was describing in Crete is where his father is from. So, if you want to go visit the Greek Islands, but cannot afford the airfare come over here and have some of the best gyros that you will ever try. The baklava is excellent, the hummus is beyond compare, just just try everything you will not be sorry and your taste buds will thank you..."}
{"text":"So amazingly fresh and an incredible taste. Definitely recommend!   One the cooks, and what seemed to be the manager, was super nice and friendly. He helped me choose the perfect dish. He  also gave me a free salad which was SO good and I'm definitely ordering that next time. It had tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, olive oil and feta cheese.  He really didn't have to do that but the fact that he did made my day. Definitely making a stop here next time I shop at the Galleria mall."}
{"text":"What a gem at Galleria Mall food court. Looked the freshest and not factory made like some filmic the other choices. Had the Greek Salad with chicken which it the spot. I wanted veggies and clean lean protein and I couldn't ask for anything more appropriate. The chicken was expertly seasoned and flavorful. Will go out of my way to eat and support this locally owned establishment."}
{"text":"Eat here if you want real food! I was walking through the food court at the mall and all the other food places have pre made food sitting out and high school kids that could care less about it working there. I walked by kyklos and was so impressed to see two guys working hard making fresh food and amazing service. AND CLEAN HEALTHY options on the menu instead of all fried pre made crap. I was completely blown away with the good food and felt like they really deserve this 5 star review when the guys behind the counter literally came out from behind the counter a few minutes after I started eating to check on me and make sure everything was to my liking. Wow. Never had that kid of service in a food court. Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon certificate and decided to head over to the mall to check this place out.    I am always leery of food court food, but Kyklos was a step above your average food court fare.    The food was freshly prepared and so there was a wait, which to me was a good thing, because it shows care for quality.  Mrs G had a good gyro and I had a steak kabob.  My steak was a bit tough, but the flavor was very nice and there was plenty of it.  The gyro had a few too onions, but again, overall a very good gyro.  Overall, I'd give this place a B+ for fresh, tasty and not your standard mall fare."}
{"text":"The owner is a GENEROUS man and super friendly!  He aims to please.  :) So, he invited me back to try his food again and so glad I did.    The chicken was still STELLAR of course.  But this time the pita bread was soft and fresh and fluffy.  I didn't have a salad because there was a salad on my chicken and the greens and tomatoes were fresh and thinly sliced just the way I like them.  The rice was light and flavorful.  The tzatziki sauce was really good too.... thick like a dip with garlic, cucumber and herbs.  I could have just eaten this and the pita and been a happy camper.  The chicken gyro plate also came with a light red sauce on the side.  I wasn't sure what it was but upon tasting it, I poured it all over my chicken and rice like a gravy.  That sauce was really good.  I mean the chicken and rice were moist and flavorful already but this sauce just added a little extra dimension.  OH!  And the Baklava.... definitely treat yourself to this sweet sensation.  It is sweet but not sugary sweet.  The phyllo dough is light and the nuts are finely chopped and it all just melts in your mouth.  After 1 bite, I knew I wasn't taking any of it home.  Thanks, Sophocles!  I'll be back again.  :)"}
{"text":"I don't go to the mall often, but when I do I always make sure to visit Kyklos. Friendly employees and great food (especially falafel and hummus). Definitely the best mall food around - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing. The owner immediately greeted us and gave us some samples. We have never had Greek food before and so we were asking questions about the menu and what to try. I asked what the falafel was and he went above and beyond to fry up a little sample for me to try.  So very helpful and friendly staff with lots of authentic options. The price was up there I won't lie, $30 for my husband and I to eat lunch but we did get a lot of delicious food. And you really wouldn't have to spend that much, we just wanted to try a few different things.  He even gave us a nice helping of some Greek meat to try for free.  Would recommend and would go back"}
{"text":"One word : HORRIBLE !!!!!! Ingredient quality and meat are just from the lowest you can get and yet prices are on the high side !!! I understand foodcourt rent must be high but this is not a reason to serve such bad food!!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. The owners are very nuce and appreciate your business. The food is good considering it's at a mall food court.  Their signature grilled chicken over rice or salad is good. The chicken is plenty seasoned so it could be a bit too salty too some people including myself. I generally don't like salty foods and try to eat more on the bland aode of the things. Their spinakopita was so salty I had to drink down a bottle of water after. Oh, the portions are huge."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been going here for almost two years and have never been disappointed. The employees are happy and friendly. The food is delicious. The price is right."}
{"text":"I never realized how much my grandparents made food very close to this.  They were from the mainland of North Portugal.  Most of the food there is Greek influenced there.   This place brought lots of great memories back for me.  Freshly cooked to order right in front of you.  I went with a $6 small chicken and rice bowl without tomato sauce (tomato allergy).  My boyfriend had a $7.50 regular gyro (hero) about half way through he was getting full!  I tried the meat in his gyro and it was amazingly tender.  My chicken was very tasty and flavorful.  The cooked veggies were taking in the flavor of the grill and it was great. I don't normally eat my veggies but I'm trying to eat more greens.  I swear this food tastes just like my grandpa's cooking. Staff and owner are super friendly and accommodating too. I wish it wasn't so far from Summerlin but if we are in the area, I would go out of my way to stop thru for a healthy choice again."}
{"text":"Great service, affordable, gyro and Greek fries were so good. A must eat place in the mall."}
{"text":"Stopped here to have lunch, was very impressed by the food! There was a mistake to our order and the person I presume to be the owner went out of his way to make it right!! Would recommend this to anyone stopping in the food court!! We had shopping to do and they let us out the corrected order and leftovers in the fridge as we went ready to go home yet.  Thanks for your yumminess! Sorry we forgot to come back and grab our leftovers!"}
{"text":"I'm from a suburb of Chicago, where we had Greek restaurants on every corner and I was in heaven. When I moved to Vegas, I've yet to find an authentic Greek restaurant that could match up to back home, until I had this today! Hands down the best I've had in Vegas. Everything was so fresh and delicious! Wish it wasn't in the mall because I really dislike going to the mall but I will definitely go just for this awesome food. The baklava was Devine!"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying food from Kyklo's for many years. This is my favorite \"go-to\" place at Galleria at Sunset. The food is always fresh and very tasty. I love their Gyros Salad!  The  owner and his staff are always very friendly and helpful, even during the lunch rush on weekends.  If you like authentic Greek flavors, I highly recommend that you try Kyklos."}
{"text":"Mad props to Kyklos for giving me healthy and delicious mall food. They are my current crush. I am not a huge fan of the Galleria for several reasons starting with the temperature and the lighting. It's always way too warm and bright for my comfort level leaving me irritable and sweaty and hungry. Ugh. But, now there's hope in the form of a gyro. Kyklos had me at the picture menu and the enormous slice of  homemade Baklava on the counter. It's nothing new or revolutionary, but they serve all of my favorite, authentic Greek grub with quality ingredients.   We ordered the chicken gyro with the yogurt sauce on the side, Greek salad with the dressing on the side, and chicken with rice with extra vegetables. Simply scrumdiddlyumptious! The homemade vinaigrette and the moist chicken made me fall in love. Every single item was full of flavor and cooked to perfection restoring my faith in mall food in general. Kyklos belongs in the Fashion Show Mall or Fashion Island in Cali. The food is above average and the service is pimp. How refreshing to not have a high, teeny bopper with braces and skinny jeans carelessly taking my order. At Kyklos they care and it shows.   Lastly it is clean. I am always scared to eat in the food courts because without fail the food spots constantly get Health Department demerits. While we were ordering and eating I noticed the staff cleaning. Boom.   This meal is part of what made yesterday magical to me and I already want more! The Golden Arches and all the other processed food choices at the mall can suck it. I'm all about the Golden Gyro!"}
{"text":"I would like to revise my review to 5 stars for this restaurant. As I stated in my previous  review I  knew it must have just been a bad day. You know nothing or no one is perfect and sometimes things just happen. There are so many excellent reviews for this restaurant (that's why I stopped in!) and when the owner contacts you and  SINCERELY apologizes it really tells you how much he cares and the pride he has for his restaurant.  I take Yelp very seriously and rely on this valuable tool to choose where I  eat and to share my experiences. I think I just had one of those \"I'm not perfect\" moments and the first thing I am going to do when I get back to the mall is to eat at Kyklos Greek Cafe again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, good portion sizes and very fresh. The employees are friendly and the service is great."}
{"text":"Rice is moist, veggies, lamb grilled perfectly. Fries with feta cheese, lemon & sauce. I like mine with feta & I dip them in tzatziki sauce. Very nice staff and family oriented. A change in pace of service for a mall food court. They let you know how long the order takes and it's cooked to order. Try this place out don't miss out"}
{"text":"I'm no expert when it comes to Greek food but Kyklos chicken gyro was awesome. We've always gone to Kyklos because they carry Tropical Ice Tea, but we never ordered any food. I know...shame on us. The Mall Food Court isn't my first choice for food. But, this place is legit.  A cook offered us some to sample their chicken. We usually pass on meat being handed out on toothpicks by workers, but he insisted-plus it was coming straight off the grill. I have to say it was very tasty and the lemon juice he squeezed on it added a light and refreshing taste versus the asian teri-sauce or shoyu chicken.   We ordered the Chicken Gyro with grilled onions and the Falafel Gyro. I took my first bite and damn...how the hell did i pass this place up. Both gyro's were good sized . We knew the chicken was already going to be good, but the falafel was also very tasty. You can't go wrong with the price for the portions of food they serve.  The owner or one of them was the cook who was very helpful in explaining what ingredients were in each dish we asked about. Some of the other employees in the food court need to take notes from him on customer service...we will refrain from naming any of the guilty parties.   Fear no more...Kyklos is not, I repeat, is not your average mall food. Its good to know that anytime you are shopping at the Galleria and start to get a rumble in your stomach...just stroll on down to the food court. And instead of hanging your head in shame, you can hold your head high knowing that you'll be getting good eats at Kyklos and not some dish that was sitting in a hot tray behind glass all day.  Aloha means hello and good bye...."}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING! You do not find food this good at a mall EVER... but for $11.00 you get an amazing pita, fries and a large Coke. It's absolutely worth the money and you will not regret it. The baklava is to die for as well! Sophocles is super nice and friendly, as are the rest of his staff...   Oh, and to the jackass who complained about the price--this isn't McDonald's. Real food costs money, and mall rent costs a lot. If you don't like it, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!!! i know, i know....its in the mall food court. BUT - it is better most greek places in vegas! even better than the mad greek!!! worth going to the mall just to eat there or take it home."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars because of the service. Honestly, its pretty impressive how nice they are considering that they are located in a mall food court and have to deal with rude, hurried shoppers all the time. They were very courteous about my groupon and explained the different pitas they offered over the phone while i placed a carryout order. Service wise, these guys were top notch-- very accommodating, very patient, very polite.  I ordered two of their original gyros, a chicken fajita gyro, and an ultimate chicken gyro which came with feta cheese and lettuce. It's definitely not bad. Their gyros are packed with meat. You honestly shouldn't be ordering fries if you are already getting one of their wraps-- it's surprisingly filling. The quality of the meat was so-so. Better than your average fast food style gyro-- the meat seemed to be more thickly sliced. (Don't ever buy a gyro at a place that doesn't explicitly specialize in middle eastern or Greek cuisine) However,  I think you're better off eating the gyros at nearby Greek Bistro. They added sliced tomatoes--pretty standard stuff. The bread was ok, thick but I would have preferred something that wrapped a bit better. But ultimately, the sauce just didn't impress me that much. I was expecting more of an authentic, cucumber based hint to it and it didn't taste much different from standard plain yogurt. Not saying that it WAS yogurt-- I really don't know what it was. But it didn't impress me.  The specialty gyros we tried were decent. The fajita style gyro is definitely different. They used what tasted like yellow american cheese and grilled bell peppers and onions. A tasty alternative to a chicken burrito you might find at your average fast food mexican place. But just ok. The ultimate greek chicken did have that tasty feta cheese in it but it didn't blow me away. The chicken was plentiful but could have been juicer. I think it would have been preferable if they had used chicken kabob instead of sliced bits of chicken breast.   At no point during the eating of the aforementioned products did I think this place was bad or regret my purchase. At the same time, there was no point at which I found myself moaning in delight over the flavors. These guys are probably a good bet if you find yourself in the mall food court, but I otherwise wouldn't recommend them as an outing when there are noticeably better greek places nearby in Henderson. Despite my lukewarm review, I WOULD come back here again in the future, but probably only with another groupon, or to try some of their dessert options."}
{"text":"Very good I had my doubts but I was impressed everything was fresh even the vegetables looked fresh ! Definitely will return my favorite is the chicken. The flavor was very unique and it wasn't dry either. U rarely find good fast food with juicy anything well check it out you'll really enjoy it."}
{"text":"By Far the best Gyro in Henderson if not all Vegas.  Over sized Gyros with a generous helping of feta and tzatziki sauce.   The owner is always smiling and giving out specials to his regulars.  The team there is very helpful explaining there large menu.  I have tried a lot of the menu and its all very good... but I just love the Gyros!  If your in Sunset Mall you have to give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  Definatly not your typical mall food.  Not to mention the service.  My husband and I used to go here all the time, even if we weren't going to the mall.  Unfortunately we moved far enough away that we hardly ever get over here...yesterday, after years The owner recognized me.  Came over and talked to me.  You just don't see that very often."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant.  I was at the mall for a few hours tonight and decided to stop by Kylos Greek Cafe again.  I've been here several times in the past when I've had a groupon and totally loved it then.  I got the gyros combo with fries and a drink.  I got the supreme which was about 13 buck and it came with feta cheese and lettuce.    The portion size is pretty large for the price and it definitely filled my stomach.  It is kinda messy if you try to eat it with your hands like you would a normal gyro.  I end up just eating it with my gold plated tiffany fork that I bring with me when I plan on eating out.  So I adverted the mess on my hands.  For mall food it's not bad compared to the other restaurants that barely survive"}
{"text":"These are the most amazing gyros I've had in a long time! Everything tastes fresh and high quality. I ordered the gyro combo and my husband ordered the gyro fries. Honestly, we could have split the fries because the portions are HUGE.  I've found my go-to gyro place now, and I couldn't be happier! The quality and customer service are phenomenal.  Usually food at the mall food court is mediocre at best, but this place is doing it right. I absolutely loved that the owner was working alongside the staff, and actively interacting with the customers. It's clear they take pride in their work.   It's a bit busy, but that's to be expected for a place this good. Especially since it's the best option at this food court!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to come for Greek food since I moved to Las Vegas 15+ years ago.  The menu has a wide variety and the food is always AMAZING!  I hope someday they're able to open a stand alone restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food, and fantastic customer service. Was very catering to my pescatarian needs. Was very helpful answering any questions I had about items on the menu and gave meaningful recommendations from their menu for my diet choices and offered samples. Would definitely come here again whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Greek food..run by a genuinely nice Greek family..with their own recipes.  It doesn't get any better.  It's located in tge food court at the Galleria..that's the only drawback for us because it's noisy ...but we love it when we go.  We pick it up to go or eat there.  Our favorites are the Greek salad w chicken...hummus and pita...spanikopita...it's all great."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast! They're always consistent and I come here anytime I'm at the mall. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a long time and have never been disappointed. The food and service are top notch! Don't let the Mall Food Court location keep you away, this is the best Greek Food in town.   Alot of places would rather use cheaper food products to make more money, but not at Kyklos, they use better quality ingredients to keep their customers happy. Worth paying a little more for quality, as they say, you get what you pay for!    Definitely try the Greek Fries, and get extra Feta Cheese and sauce on the side. The Gyros are great as well as the Cheese Pie or Flaming Cheese.    Would recommend for anyone visiting Henderson or the Galleria Mall."}
{"text":"Great authentic Greek food in a casual setting..... Very fresh and flavorful.... Great gyros."}
{"text":"Alright stop reading here, this review is all you need. I love this place. You looking for good, affordable, fast, and convenient place to eat, then you go here. The gyro was so big I didn't even finish all mine. It ended up being a great midnight snack! The fries were golden and crispy. The meat seasoned and juicy. Baklava was sweet and flaky. Best of all, we were fed by Jacob who made a gyro fit for a king. Or in my case, a queen. I was surprised this place was at a mall. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"First off the kid at register has difficulty taking an order.I understand its probably your first job.I dont work there! If I ask a question about your menu dont look at me stupid.Food is ok at best after waiting over 20 min to get it.Somehow a gyro fry and drink was 13 bucks.I asked several time to the kid but deer in headlights and back n forth 5 times.He also was persintent on boxing up my food idk why.Oh and they gave me some prayer card on my tray.I dont feel a business should push religious beliefs!! Food is greasy get tzakiki on the side! Fries were fresh and food is not bad . organization  is poor and staff have difficulty when busy"}
{"text":"Service is ALWAYS great here. Workers are always friendly and nice. Personally the best gyro place I've been able to find in Vegas so far. The manager recognized us as returning customers and comped us 2 meals. Always love eating here :-)"}
{"text":"I would totally recommend this place. The food is awesome and the customer service even better.  The guy that took my order was very personable and extremely thoughtful. If you're in the mood for a great gyro check them out ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that this establishment is in a mall fool you. They have some of the best Greek food around in the city. There's a wide variety choose from, for everyone to find something to eat. Because it's made fresh to order, allow a few extra minutes for preparation."}
{"text":"The Kyklos gyros are really great. The service was excellent-----fast and friendly. Will definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this little place in the mall for over 10 years now... Quality is consistent and the food is fresh and delicious! I especially love the chicken gyro! I also frequently get the spinach pie and the tabouleh salad. Now if I could only figure out how to NOT get the sauce all over my face!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd give food court food 5 stars, but yep, that's what it is. It does not seem like you're in with a Panda Express and a Cinnabon.   I ordered chicken and rice with a side of tzatziki. The tzatziki was unlike what I had had before, but it was very good. Tons of veggies are in with this dish, too, so you feel like you're doing something good for your body while you're eating fast food.   Also, the teenagers they have working are super, super friendly. Usually teenagers are cranky, especially in a mall food court, but not here. Yes, I will have a sample of your gyro meat, thank you, and I'm so glad that it's not from a gross tray out in the middle of the tables.   Jaunt past all the gross places and enjoy some pretty delicious Greek here!"}
{"text":"If I wasn't a Greek permanent resident and have not lived in Greece for over 10 years (and counting), I would say \"So, this what Greek food is like.  It's OK, I guess.\" and possibly gave them 3stars.  But knowing what Greek food really is including regional Greek dishes,  Kyklos' food is nothing but Americanized Greek food (read:  bastardized Greek food).  Don't get me wrong,  they're not bad, they were just modified to cater to and please the American palate, but me having the luxury of devouring the real thing, all I can say is:   \"Ela re, filoi mou!!  Plaka kaneis?\"    I had their chicken gyro combo plate and was surprised to see a mountain of lettuce on my gyro!  It looked like a Mexican wrap (and actually somewhat tasted Mexican to me.  Maybe they used Mexican oregano instead of the greek variety?).  The tzatziki sauce didn't taste like the \"greek yoghurt/shredded cucumber/dill\" concoction I am used to.  It has the consistency of and tasted like your ordinary table ranch dressing.  The lemon on the overcooked chicken meat was overpowering as opposed to the simple salt/oregano marinade (I saw them saute' the meat on their flat grill and was left on the grill).    Note;  A typical or traditional Greek gyro meat is cooked on a vertical rotating broiler, then served with the just slightly charred shaved broiled meat, red onion, tomatoes, and tzatziki on a grilled thick pita bread, with or without fried potatoes.  The northern part of Greece serves their gyros with or without ketchup and mustard.  Some Greek islands away from the mainland usually serve their gyros on a grilled thin (almost like the Indian naan, very crusty) pita bread.    Again, am not lambasting their business.  Their food is not bad.  They're good, it's just that I've had better.  They're tasty and delicious in some levels, and am not surprised a lot of people like and enjoy what they offer albeit in a mall environment.    I haven't tried their other offerings so I can't speak in general terms but just basing from the gyro I had, it didn't taste traditional to me.  In fact, it didn't taste anything like Greek to me.  Signwmh :("}
{"text":"Awesome Taboli Salad! Tzatziki was excellent family recipe. Recommend for sure. They cater and deliver. The owner and staff take pride in what they do. We will be back."}
{"text":"Was at a mall for the first time in almost a year. We decided to try the food court. It had some interesting choices. We came across this place. The menu looked good, then I saw they had felafel. Had to try it. My wife and I ordered a felafel pita, fries, chicken souvlaki, and baklava for dessert. It came to $30! Then we got the food. Wow. It was great! Well worth the$. Only drawback was their ketchup, or the stuff they try to pass-off as ketchup. Chef choice from restaurant depot is not ketchup! Hunt's is not ketchup! Only Heinz can really be considered ketchup. If it ain't Heinz it ain't shit! Anyway, the food was great and was some of the best baklava I have ever had. We ordered more to-go. My wife doesn't eat leftovers, but she actually got a to-go box for later. All in all I was very happy and will eat there again if I have the opportunity."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying not what I would expect in a mall food court!! Great service wonderful food its a must do again. Im new to Greek food and on this menue you will be coming back again and again..."}
{"text":"I've NEVER had a bad experience here. The customer service is beyond amazing, for example, if it's taking a while to process everyone's orders, someone (usually the owner) will apologize for the inconvenience and thank everyone for their business. To me, that is incredibly thoughtful and conscientious of everyone's time.  The food itself is....heaven. Absolutely incredible. I've never tried Greek food but once I tried one thing I had to try everything and so far i'm not disappointed.  I've been coming enough now that the workers recognize me and I love that they ask how i'm doing or pick up on our conversation from last I was there. They know how to make you feel like you're welcome.  If you haven't tried Greek food, the team is also gracious enough to offer suggestions, so with that said, definitely make a stop at this location!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros in Las Vegas, the supreme with feta and lettuce is outstanding.  The staff are all very friendly, great service.  Don't let the mall food court location fool you, great food"}
{"text":"This is the second time that our hiking group has stopped at the Galleria Mall Food Court after a hike to enjoy some food and social time.  As it turned out both times, everyone got food from the Kyklos Greek Cafe rather than one of the other outlets.    I ordered a beef gyro with an order of fries and with \"everything\" added to the meat--shredded lettuce, tomatoes, tzatziki, onion, and feta.  There were nine of us but just one worker when we got there.  The one person soon got a helped when the 11:30 hour arrived, but the one did almost everything himself and he was very efficient.  The sandwich is certainly tasty and very filling.  Also, make sure you get extra napkins.  With the tzatziki and all the vegetables I got, it was take a bite, wipe your hands and mouth and then repeat.  I think next time I'll get it as a platter.  For food court fare, this is quite good Greek food.  The sandwich is made from fresh ingredients save for the pre-cooked beef and chicken which are heated on a grill before constructing the sandwich.  The price for the meal is reasonable.  This is a solid choice and worth a detour if you want to give some Greek food a try."}
{"text":"I had to grab a quick meal and I love gyros. Ordered the one w beef/lamb and they fill it up. You get your money's worth for sure. Very tasty as well. Staff was super friendly too."}
{"text":"This is a really good Greek cafe  in the food court at galleria mall.  Delicious fresh iOS made right in front of you, great service  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"So walking around the mall with my son and my mother who is in town visiting. I wanted greek food and stopped here and was immediately greeted by Mike who has great customer service skills cannot believe i find awesome professionalism and absolutely delicious food here in the mall. Will be back even if its just for the food!"}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite and tonight was no different. The food is fresh and each person that orders is treated as if they were a guest in their home. Tonight I got to witness a special moment. One of the owners were working with two younger boys coaching them each step of the way . Although he was stern he was very detailed and passionate about his delivery and both boys listened and were very respectful. It was a very powerful moment. Thank you for the wonderful food as always and thank you for helping mold a generation of young hard working men!"}
{"text":"This may not be a fair review for some because I have not been to this place for a few years.  I starting going to this place about seven years ago and would there once a week.  The owners of the place were brothers and were all very nice.  Their customer service with me was always above and beyond.  I do not know if the quality had gone down or not since it has been awhile since I dined there, but I can tell you I still consider this place to have the best gyro in town.  It is a big surprise considering that it is in a mall food court.  I would tell the owners that they needed to get out of the mall and open their own place somewhere else.  They have succeed by staying in the food court, and more power to them.  Their gyro's are very large and fulling.  I alway get the gyro supreme and it does the trick.  The baklava can be hit or miss depending on how long it had been sitting out.  The price is reasonable too.  I feel bad that I have not been there for such a long time, but since I moved deeper into Henderson I do not find myself in the area of the Galleria Mall.  It was convenient when I live next GVHS as this place was only two minutes away.  I would recommend that everyone try this place at least once, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place blows harder than the Greek economy. Let me detail their price gouging. My standard order at a delicious americanized Greek joint is feta fries and gyro meat. Here a small boat of gyro meat is $5.45, feta fries for $4.75. To put it in perspective I go to the Great Greek 4 minutes away and get a bigger side of gyro meat for $2.50, a better/edible order of Feta fries for $3.00 and delicious Tzatziki for $.75. Also for all you soda guzzling gluttons out there soda refills at Kyklos are $.75. Gougalicious  So it's established that this is expensive. is it good? Nope. Gyro meat is the same old msg loaded product from Kronos so that doesn't really count. The feta fries were literally a handful of well done freezer fries topped with cold feta cheese doused in oil and oregano. When I say doused, I mean there was a puddle of oil in the bottom of my fry boat. Not tasty olive oil or anything just a bunch of flavorless vegetable oil possibly and dried herbs. So that was my meal, a complete rip off.  It doesn't quit there. I bought my uncle a standard gyro (red onion, tomato, tzatziki) which came out to $7.50. The cashier asked if we'd like to add feta to it for a $1.50?! Are you joking? Again for perspective let's reference a delicious AmGreek restaurant like the Great Greek where the standard gyro is $7.95 and includes feta and lettuce. If you wanted some extra feta on that gyro, because your taste buds are burnt out and you're sick in the mouth: at the Great Greek it's only $.75. The point of the matter is this, if you're seeking value and deliciousness around Sunset and the 95: Kyklos isn't where it's at. Higher prices, lower quality in my experience. Check my upcoming review of what feta fries should be on the Great Greek. Those are some kind of wonderful."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I ate what was recommended to me. A falafel plate. The falafel was dry, the rice was soggy and tasteless. They put so much sliced onion on everything, that's all I could taste."}
{"text":"I...love...this....place!!! The owner is so nice! The food is delicious! And I'm full! I come here once a week and try different things each time. The lamb gyro supreme is so tasty. I recommend this place to anyone who loves good food. Don't worry about it being in the mall, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The staff is a little pushy when offering samples and trying to upsale you at the register.  But the food is great.  I'm a gyro salad and gyro plate kinda guy and they are both good-sized meals.    Ordered their falafels once... Wasn't quite so good.  Not as crispy and didn't quite taste right.  I'm thinking they were frozen and not fresh made.  Probably the best food I've had in that mall."}
{"text":"Some other reviews mention Groupon, and I'm definitely rating this under the Groupon price. It would be 3 stars if I was buying it normal price, but since I'm never going to eat here without Groupon, that's fine with me.  I had the gyros deluxe and the falafel gyros. The former was pretty good, but really messy, and the paper wrapping at the bottom was getting soaked The latter I haven't finished eating, but I gave it a couple bites to see if it I would end up doing another Groupon purchase. It's pretty good, but definitely a smaller portion and not as much depth of flavor in the sauce and toppings as similarly priced falafels at my favorite places back in California.  If I wanna go out with friends for this type of cuisine, I'll probably look for another place. If I'm stuck at the mall for some reason, I'll probably do one of the big chains. But if I want to feel like I'm getting a nice deal, I'll use one of my Groupons for this place and get a gyro or falafel for basically $3.50 a pop."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best gyro in town. You just can't find better. I tell everyone about this place, and I go way way way out of my way to come here. Completely worth it."}
{"text":"Never had Greek food before but was stopped and offered a sample of the grilled chicken and was it rated good so we figured why not?  The menu had a lot of things and with me being indecisive I would've been sitting there forever trying to figure out what everything was.  The lady in front of me ordered the grilled chicken over rice plate and said it's really good so I went with it.  I was still a little weary of the sauce that came with it since I wasn't sure if I would like it but decided to just take it as is.  I was glad I did! The chicken was moist and had good flavor, the veggies were fresh and seasoned good and the rice with the sauce was light and really good too!  I finished the whole thing and didn't feel bloated or grossed out, definitely a good choice for food court food if you don't want deep fried, heavy, greasy foods.  The employees were really nice too, good restaurant quality food in a food court mall.  Still crave it once in a while."}
{"text":"Got a great deal through restaurant.com which I purchased after seeing the overall good reviews on yelp and elsewhere.  Didn't realize it was in a mall food court or I might have given it a miss.  However, I'm glad I bought the certificate because we had a great  take-out meal with lots of leftovers (because we had to spend a total of $35 to use the coupon).    Unlike other reviewers who complained about their food not traveling well, we thought about what would be good take-out food and were not disappointed.  Chicken plate (yum), chicken salad (yum), and taboulleh (yum, too).  Not exactly sure why the large taboulleh without any meat costs $12, but didn't really care when we got such a great deal overall and it tasted good.  Prices on everything else seemed reasonable.  Lots of food for the well-discounted price, but even at regular prices, not bad value.  I think two people could probably split something like the chicken salad or chicken plate.    Also, there were three people working, unlike the understaffed experience described by another reviewer, and they were accommodating  in that I had misread one of the restrictions on the coupon but they honored it anyway, which we much appreciated after having driven a ways to get there.  Left a big tip.  Bottom line:  Nice staff, good food, okay prices, not bad a wait. No ambience, but we went away happy and got to enjoy our food at home in comfort while watching a movie.  Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing!! Brought my mom here for the first time and she's never had Greek food before and the words out of her mouth were \"I hope they Greek food in Heaven!\" Needless to say she love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The chicken gyro is delicious!  My husband gets the regular.  We both get feta to make them supreme!  We've been coming here since 2002 - Sophocles is the best!  Rice pudding is a great treat!"}
{"text":"I have been coming since the Gslleria Mall opened! The food is amazing and is truly authentic! The consistency is astounding. The customer service is top notch and I tell everyone I know that this where you go for a gyros. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"In keeping with my own self enforced tradition of ordering a sampler plate when trying a new place, I ordered the Greek Sampler plate from Kyklos today. The price was a bit much but there was a lot of food and a good variety. Lets break it down:  A Greek Sampler plate comes with gyro meat, chicken, rice, dolma, spanikopita, tikopita and tzaziki sauce. Thats a lot of food. I started with the gyro meat and tzaziki sauce. The sauce was great. Tangy. Dilly. Fresh. The meat was good too. A little dry and thickly sliced compared to what I am used to but great flavor. Then I moved on to the chicken. Well seasoned and mostly tender. Nothing exciting though. The tikopita, unknown to me before this outting, was impressive. Flaky, crispy, cheesy. I'd order that again. The dolma was served warm with a lemon sauce. And it was stuffed with meat and rice as opposed to just rice. That was a different take but no less delicious. Dolma is a favorite treat of mine. In multiple varieties. Next I cleaned off all the rice out of the platter. Rice is rice but but this was good. There was some sort of sauce on it that added a little something. Finally, the spanikopita. It was filled with spanikopious amounts of spinach, onion and cheese. An impressive and filling representation of a dish I've a few times elsewhere.  Whew, that was a mouth full. A few mouths full really. Who knew solid Greek food could come from the food court at the mall. The service was good and friendly though the lady taking my order kept trying to add on more food. Had I gone with all she had offered, my meal would have been over $20. I kept my order with the sampler as is and only added on a drink. That was more than enough. While I waited for everything to be prepped and served, I was watching the dynamic of the people working behind the scenes. I could tell that they were family. Its good to see that and you can taste it in the food. I've passed by this place too many times. No more. I'll have to come back to Kyklos and try some other goodies."}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing. The owner (?) has great customer service, honestly, better than most full-fledged restuarants. The food was A+ so if you're ever at the food court, stop by. You definitely won't regret it.  I got a chicken gyro and mozzarella sticks (the marina sauce was AWESOME) and my husband got gyro fries. He's usually pretty stingy on giving compliments but he had nothing but praise for both the service and the food. Come check it out, seriously!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the quality for being mall food, friendly staff that really seem to care about what they're doing!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!  We don't really get to the mall that often. When we do, it is only to go to the big box stores. We were hungry, and nothing sounded good. We were actually headed to another place when they enticed us with samples here at Kyklos. They had chicken right off of the grille. It was really flavorful.  Then we couldn't decide what entree to get. The guy ordering in front of us asked if we had ever been to this place, and then offered up about 3 selections that he gets. They all included the chicken. We decided to split a chicken gyro. I am not a fan of feta cheese, so we opted not to get that add-on.   They cooked ours to order. It came out loaded with chicken, thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and that wonderful tzatziki sauce. The pita was warm and soft. This was a very tasty meal. Very messy...so make sure and get lots of napkins. Also, their soda refills are 75 cents, if you need one."}
{"text":"The chicken salad with dressing is soooo good & the staff was super sweet too. I hardly ever eat mall food but this is next level.  :)"}
{"text":"I never appreciated Greek food till place. Been coming here for years now. Sometimes me and my husband would drive here from Green Valley area just to have it for dinner.   One thing I don't like.... Is the price! I've always thought $10 is a little much. I have always ordered the same thing. Chicken Gyro Plate. I think I ordered just a regular style Gyro once and just enjoyed the plate much better.  I believe the owners used to work behind the counter and now they have hired people? If that's the case... Good for them!!! Although I do prefer the owners, if that was them in the past. Best personality, very friendly and welcoming.   I probably come here at least once a month. My only ONLY gripe..... SEEDS!!! I have not even completed my meal and have bitten down on 5 seeds already! Lemon seeds? I don't know? Can you guys please strain the juice so that customers don't bite down on seeds... I have to fish them out from my mouth while trying to enjoy my meal??? Please!!!   Aside from the seeds and the price... I'm happy! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Very impressive for Greek and \"food court food!\" This place takes passion in their product and it shows every time, never a time where it's lacking. It's a bummer when places try to pass as \"Mediterranean\" or \"Greek\" and they're not. Kyklos is the real deal! The dolmathes are amazing; meat-filled and with lemon sauce. They don't have the usual gummy rice filling that's so tart it makes you gag. They also come warm at Kyklos, a plus! Rice pudding is something I always get and its worth it. Warm, seasoned perfectly and great size for the price. The best is that you know you are getting fresh, quality, and pretty healthy food at Kyklos. A must when I come to galleria mall, in fact I'd eat here before any of the restaurants."}
{"text":"Not only is the food fantastic, the people are so friendly and helpful. I had my first Gyro with these guys and I go back for more every time I'm at galleria mall. For me its the best food there. The meat is so tender. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Num num num. Since moving to Vegas, Mall food has meant one of two things...pizza or Panda Express type places. Oh, that was not the case when we were holiday shopping and in need of some food. I go through times when I eat A LOT of Greek food. This time was at the tail end of one of those times, so I was a bit hesitant to try Greek food at the mall. Both my wife and I had the falafel gyro with hummus and pita. WOW...all the food was fantastic! The falafels where very well prepared, and had the perfect texture. The hummus tasted fresh, and the pita was some of the best I have ever had.  While we were waiting for our food, the owner chatted with us for a few minutes as well. This really capped off a great experience as he was willing to answer questions we have.  Great place to have a quality meal while shopping, particularly for those folks who may be vegetarian or have a hard time finding healthy food at the mall."}
{"text":"The staff are super kind and the food is amazing. Never had a bad experience there. I'm looooooving the gyro fries."}
{"text":"A little slow bit well worth the wait.  Had the chicken gyro amd humus for lunch.   It was so good I've been talking about it all day."}
{"text":"Always great food and customer service!!!! Guys here put in that werkkk!!!! Highly reccomend this place oddly enough it's located in the galleria mall"}
{"text":"Beyond good!!! Authentic Greek food and quality service!  Clean and fresh! I highly recommend eating here!!!"}
{"text":"Greek cafe located in the food court of the Galleria Mall.  The staff were very friendly and let me sample some of the chicken while I was overlooking the menu.  I had the grilled chicken gyro which was absolutely delicious. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was starving and this place was still disappointing. The gyro was not warm enough the meat was just salty,not flavorful.  The tabbouleh was $3.25 for a tiny cup that was mainly just filled with parsley. Possibly the most disappointing Greek food I've eaten. On top of it all the prices are pretty expensive even compared to mall prices. Nearly $12 for a small gyro and some tabbouleh? Maybe their prices could be more reasonable if they didn't hand out business cards with pointless quotes from ancient philosophers on them.  This place is pure garbage."}
{"text":"This location inside of the Galleria Mall is very convenient if you need a quick bite. The menu is large so it took some time for me to decide what I wanted to order.  The customer service was really good. Everyone working was friendly and they kept up a fast pace in getting all of the orders out to customers.   I had the Chicken Over Rice plus a Chicken Souvlaki skewer. The price was reasonable for the enormous amount of food. I was able to enjoy half for dinner and half for lunch the next day. The rice was great, well prepared with a little oil for flavor. The dish also came with plenty of vegetables. I'm also a fan when a restaurant includes vegetables and they had a good taste. The chicken that came with the dish was in small pieces with a nice flavor to them. The souvlaki pieces were larger pieces that were tender, but lacked flavor. The tomato sauce served with the dish was really good and I loved the flavor. The sauce definitely made the dish."}
{"text":"This is my update to Kyklos as I was contacted by the very, very nice manager in response to my disappointment I had with my Groupon and gyro experience.   I have once again returned to Kyklos and I will return again and again when I am shopping at The Galleria. It honestly is the best place to eat in the food court. They take great pride in their food here and the staff is incredibly friendly. This time I went I once again had a gyro and this time I got my feta on the side. I highly recommend this as it lets you sprinkle the exact amount of feta as you eat. I also got the rice, which I thought would be simple, yet it was bursting with delicious tomato flavor!  I must say Kyklos is kicking butt in the arena of mall food AND Greek food! Can't wait to try something else here."}
{"text":"To say this is my favorite spot I have ever had a gyro would be doing this plays a major disservice. I have been an obsessive customer for over six years, and their customer service has always been one that could go toe to toe with one of the nicest restaurants you've ever been to, The quality of their ingredients makes it near impossible to even enjoy a gyro anywhere else, and the portion size you could argue is the best bang for your buck he will ever find.   I promise you would be doing yourself a disservice not experiencing this for yourself."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years. I never thought I'd make a trip to the mall just for food. By far the best Greek food I've had in Vegas. The staff is always nice, warm, and welcoming. Nice to see a team time pride in their food."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place as I love Gyros (at least most of them).  I must say this place passed my test.  the Gyro was outstanding!  Full of flavor, better than a lot of others I have tried."}
{"text":"I think I need to give this place another shot but not sure if I want to. After looking at everyone's pictures and reviews the food looks so good! That's definitely NOT what my Gyro looked like this morning...  I took my son to the mall this morning and we were both starving. Trying to steer clear of greasy pizza I wandered here thinking its been awhile since I've even had Greek food. The guy at the counter was really friendly, it took about 10 minutes to make but when I opened it, it was one big greasy, sauce ball. So much sauce and so soggy it was unenjoyable. The meat was seasoned well but everything else tasted old and...wet :(   For $9, I wasn't very satisfied. Maybe our next mall visit I'll try again and request for an easy on the sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place today!  My first Greek restaurant I went to 12 years ago in Vegas and it's still as delicious as the first time!  I hate that I moved so far away, but if I'm ever in the area I stop in for a delicious treat!  Super friendly staff doesn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"We just found a new spot. Great service from a family business. They greet you when you arrive in the area.  It makes you feel like family!!  I would never expect this kind of mouth watering food in a mall.   Try the Gyro Supreme, it is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Got the Dolmas for lunch to go.. Was not that hungry so figured a side of dolmas would be perfect. Opened the container at the office they were put together pretty sloopy, almost falling apart There was no taziki sauce or marinara sauce which I was expecting... I'm a sauce whore so this no sauce thing is kind of a deal breaker. I ate 2 and was over it. I have had way better dolmas and counld't stomach the other one. Pretty disappinted considering that the Gyros here are amazing."}
{"text":"I had lost all hope for meeting any friendly people in Henderson until I met Soph at Kyklos. Soph is so warm and personable, couldn't help but purchase from Soph. I had the chicken gyro. Wonderful. The meat is seasoned to perfection. There is enough food for leftovers. Love how Soph offers you a sample with such enthusiasm with every potential customer. I highly recommend eating here. The food is great and Soph is wonderful."}
{"text":"The food, owner and service is absolutly amazing!  If you like Greek food you can't go wrong at Kyklos Greek Cafe!"}
{"text":"Ordered the leg of lamb plate. Rice was bland and kind of mushy. Came with barely any veggies. The meat was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Baklava  was NOT good. Tasted a lot  different than other baklava..."}
{"text":"Ok, now when your in a mall you expect to spend a little more cause your in the mall and you expect ehh?, mall food. well here's the reason why I only gave Kyklos 3 stars, there is no denying the food is great, the Gyro, the tsadziki, hummus everything is exceptional price however does not correlate with the surrounding. No matter how good your food is owners need to keep in mind the environment. Which is the problem with this place they know the food is good but waaaaaaay over priced for mall food. I was shopping hungry so i went in last week had a gyro plate tabbouleh and a pop for $18.69????? That's just plain outrageous, especially considering I'm eating on a dirty table next to a group of teenagers being loud and obnoxious. If they want to charge that much they should open a fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the owner and the staff have great customer service right when you walk up he asks if you've ever eaten there and gives you a sample he cares about his business definitely be back"}
{"text":"Have been getting food from this spot for years, always good. Lately noticed food was slipping last couple of times. This time almost Not Edible. Gyro meat was dry and hard. Pita was stale. Lettuce was brown. Big Disappointment!! Hope owners read their reviews. Time to shake things up!!!! Bad Help???"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a solid Gyro place for a while and today I was pleasantly surprised to find so much more. The food knocked it out of the park, but the curator of aura, flavor, and customer service who is named Jacob knocked it out of this world. The foods great, the workers are the best. Keep up the awesome work ."}
{"text":"Hidden inside the Galleria Mall is one of the more interesting food court places I've ever ate at. Kyklos was a pleasant surprise, especially after my experience with Manna not long ago.   I ended up with a Chicken over rice dish with fresh vegetables, fresh pita bread and a drink that cost me around $11. What I got was a loaded plate, some of the freshest pita bread I've had, but yet while it was flavorful it was kind of ho-hum. The vegetables despite being steamed longer than normal were still tough. And the marinated chicken that I got to sample at the counter while ordering just didn't taste the same once it was mixed with everything else.   I had hope this would be better than it was. But it's just a 3 star experience for me. But I will go back and try something else as maybe it was just an off day for me, or the food, or both. Also their fountain drinks were not mixed properly and they get a mention on my Payment Card Chaos list as you gotta show ID and sign. Read my list description of why I think that sucks and I flag it every time.   One bonus: Service: I asked questions and got answers about the food. I really wish I could give them 4 stars, but I can't do it. 3 will have to suffice, for now.  Edit: Out of 200+ reviews, the owner of Kyklos was the first to send me a message and directly respond to my comments. That knocks my socks off. An owner that gives a damn ranks right up there with service with a smile. I now can claim both here. And after looking back at the review I may have been biased. I've had 2 days of Thai food for lunch. Kyklos is too good to be used as a bounceback review after such a stellar experience. Adding that 4th Star. (Plus the Pita bread I had left over is still so good!) I will go back and try other things, and I welcome recommendations on what to try."}
{"text":"This fast food restaurant is located in the food court of the Galleria Mall.   We both enjoyed our gyros, but our piece of baklava was drier than a bone."}
{"text":"Excellent food & wonderful customer service!   The quality & customer care here is worth a more intamate location aside from the mall food court (maybe serving wine & beer).   Well done (: YUM"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Great Service, Great Food, for a fair price. My husband and I spent the day at the Galleria Mall, it was time to eat lunch we were so hungry we didn't want to travel anywhere, so we ate at Kyklos.  We enjoyed every bit of it.  I hope they open a place over on the southwest side of town."}
{"text":"First of all I don't think customer service should be refused because I didn't eat here, I had spilled a drink and needed napkins ASAP and I was sitting right across from this place so I hurried to get some napkins and they refused to give me any because I didn't eat here... it's not my fault that Greek food sucks and they don't get enough customers to be able to just give out napkins to someone that didn't want to eat Gunk food unlike McDonalds everyone talks shit but they give me napkins."}
{"text":"I hate giving a one star review but his place blows. They only have one person working so it took 25 minutes for a gyro to be done. That was crazy. And then it was not even good. And to top it off they charge you for the tzatziki sauce..that was really just plain greek yogurt. I wont be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. Definitely come back again. I usually never go to the mall to eat but this place is the exception."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such good reviews. The food is basic and the portions are small. Disappointing"}
{"text":"Awesome as always! I still say your the best in town! Tonight I tried the baklava that my daughter got and I'm not a big fan usually but that was amazing. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Excellent greek food. Worth going into the mall for, even if you aren't shopping! The food is fresh, salads are good. Combo platter is a great option to try a bit of almost everything  you can add a skewer too. Baklava is home made and very, very good."}
{"text":"Our go to when we want Greek food. Have never had any better then right here. Every item will please your taste buds. Bonus is the staff is always super pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the people leaving Kyklos negative reviews were drunk, drugged, trying to leave a review for Capriotti's (oooh, sandwich burn), or employees of the mongolian bbq place next to Kyklos (which I noticed a couple days ago is closed - wah wah sad trumpet).   Anyways, I wrote this just after finishing the leftover 2nd half of my chicken gyro (that's right, they're that big). I don't waste my time on anything other than tasty baby lamb meat in my gyros, but when the owner offered me a sample of their chicken, I almost fell over from how good just the chicken is by itself. It got even better when stuffed inside a pita and smothered in feta cheese.  Not gonna lie - tastiest gyro anywhere (lamb & chicken - me and the wifey went halvesies). Good mall food? Who would've thought. Bad reviewers? Friends don't let friends drink and yelp."}
{"text":"I love this place,  I have been eating here for years. One of the best Greek places in town. They have the best Gyro in Vegas.  The owners are cool. And they always remember my name.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Greek food in the mall. Chicken breast over rice is my favorite. Friendly owner and great staff. Anytime I am in the mall during lunch time I eat here. There is a large variety of food to try."}
{"text":"BRING Mints or Chewing Gum with you!  You will be chowing down some serious scrumptious food with tons of garlic (yeah) so bring the breath stuff and make sure you are not a vampire.  If you ever are forced to go to a mall and eat there, this is the place you want to go, which is located at the food court of Galleria Mall in Henderson.  1.  Ambiance  - this is a food court. It has a cafeteria type ambiance. Fast food feel.  2,  Service - Could not tell if anyone was ethnic Greek or Mediterranean descent, but all the staff I spoke to seem to be very knowledgeable of the food.  3.  Food -  The pita bread - This is very important in any middle eastern food. And while they used bread that came in plastic packages, I could not tell if it was home made or not. However, the consistency was about right, the texture good and I found it to be pretty good overall. They give you plenty of it too.  The Souvlaki - We ordered the Chicken Souvlaki and it was very , very nice. The chicken is cooked on a skewer right in front of you if you are willing to wait the 8-9 minutes of cooking. It is tender and when mixed with the tzatziki sauce they give you, it is really good.  Comes with veggies, rice and pita bread. The serving size is just right and the quality of taste is pretty good.  The Baba Ghanouge - I always order this as my way to distinguish one restaurant from another.  I look for the nice smoky roasted flavor of the eggplant and the very subtle texture of the tahine sauce that will create the right consistency for dipping my pita bread in and chowing down.  I really liked the dish here, very flavorful and just the right texture.  4.  For mall food, this is really good stuff.  5.  I will be coming back again and try the desserts next time too.  GK says, check it out"}
{"text":"been ordering the same damn thing for ten years, chicken over rice. it's like comfort food to me. the tomato chicken broth (I think that's what it is) flavors the veggies and the rice. always friendly customer service. the wait can be long when they get busy, but it's worth the wait. I eat here even when I'm not shopping it's so good. disclaimer, my picture is shown half-eaten."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek Food.  I have been hooked on the Chicken Greek Salad for years.  They cook their chicken fresh with all kinds of herbs & fresh lemons.  The flavor is out of this world!!! Everyone is always so friendly and nice offering good service & a sample of the meat.  I highly suggest trying this spot.  I go to the mall just to get their food to go and take back to work."}
{"text":"My fave 'mall' food.  #kyklos at the #gallariamall in #henderson.  Incredible,  family-owned #greek restaurant.  Fresh,  healthy selections. I get the small #gyro #salad. Tons of #protein and the small is plenty of food for one person.  Check it out!  #healthyfoodreview #fitspiration #fittips #fitchixclub"}
{"text":"I grew up with Greek neighbors across the street. I feel quite lucky to have homemade meals by these neighbors. The food at Kyklos is legit. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. Also, the owners (especially Sof) were so kind. Not just to the customers, but they are so patient and very nice to their employees. We were in Henderson for a wedding and stumbled upon Kyklos at the mall while shopping. If I didn't live in LA and close to Henderson, I would eat at Kyklos all the time!!!"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     14/100  Although my check ins don't reflect it, I've been coming here for years. When I lived on this side of town, I would eat here a couple times each month.   They have great quality Greek food. I usually get the Gyro with a side salad or the Gyro Salad and the slices of gyro meat are thick and juicy.   I was a bit put off by the service last time I was here... The guy helping us (I'm assuming was the owner) was upselling us without telling us that the items he was mentioning would be an additional $3 and not part of the meal. Creating a higher  bill. It's been a couple months since I've been here. I NEVER got this service from him or anyone who worked here before.   He was also yelling at a young man he was training in front of everyone. That turned me off and effected my enjoyment of my food...there was also a long wait 10-15 mins more than usual as he was trying to do everything himself. He did have his mother?? helping but there was a line forming behind us.  The salad I had was okay this time around. The gyro meat was juicy and thick but there was a half pound of iceberg lettuce and for $13 not worth it. I would have been better off just getting ala carte gyro meat/chicken & side of veggies for my meal to satisfy me.   The baklava is flavorful and better than most in Vegas, but a bit too sweet for me.   Maybe he was having a bad day or something but that doesn't excuse his behavior."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's in Galleria Mall so every time I'm there I stop thru. Their staff is super friendly and the taziki sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is my new spot for Gyros!  If you are gonna check it get it with Feta, makes such a huge difference. then again Feta on anything makes it better, kinda like bacon I guess.   Price is decent, portion is nice sized, tomatoes on gyro tatse crisp and fresh.   The mall location kinda sucks since I'm not much of a mall rat.   They have the meat on the spit which is awesome and the only way they should really be doing gyros."}
{"text":"my Favorite spot for Greek food! The chicken supreme gyro is amazing! I was helped by Soph and his customer service is Excellent! Super nice guy! Thank you for the great food and experience!"}
{"text":"You have the best gyros I have ever eaten in any restaurant. My daughter and I will continue to frequent your establishment. Thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"Very yummy. Had chicken n rice bowl. Just what I wanted. Great portion. Hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and great service led by Mike the manager. This place is always consistent ."}
{"text":"Every time I come to the Galleria mall to eat my choice is always Kyklos Greek Cafe for their gyro. Delicious"}
{"text":"My family loves to get Greek food here. The owner is super nice and the food is always fresh. I really like the tiropita and the gyros the best. The prices may seem expensive but they are pretty generous with their portions."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent customer service! Good portions, fresh veggies. Delish! We'll be back!  Changed to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We were due! They updated their menu board. Fancy! I love it! They look even more modern. Screens are bright and clear. Your eyeballs don't have to scramble around the menu--perfect!   Let me just say, we got treated EXCEPTIONAL tonight! They're typically great with their customer service from.our previous visits. However, Sophocles, the owner, came out to personally take care of my husband and I. We shook hands, and his overall aura seemed extremely grateful and genuine. He was pleasant and very articulate sounding, which is probably why his passion translates into his business so well!   Tonight, we ordered our usual chicken supreme gyro (supreme= lettuce, tomatoes, feta cheese, onions), kylkos gyro, fried calamari, Greek fries, baklava, and their rice pudding that Sophocles offered us to try.   We weren't disappointed at all. Their greek fries are the best greek fries we've had! That's not being biased just because we love it here, but it's super true. Try it! They give you the sauces on the side for you to mix in or dip in yourselves. Which I think is great so your fries does not start to sog. The sauces for the fries are tzatiki and olive oil blend with Mediterranean seasonings. The fries already had the feta cheese atop. By the way, their feta cheese is deelish!  Tonight was the first time we had their greek fries and the the rice pudding. Which by the way is what we filipinos call champorado. I didn't even realize when he offered his rice pudding that champarado in English is rice pudding. Lol. When I hear rice pudding English form I'm thinking it's something completely different. Mommy brain. Don't judge. But wasn't all that different.  Anyway, I enjoyed it and so did my sons. My 8 month old kept trying to pull the spoon to his mouth. When it is baby approved, you know tis good. Personally, I like this version better because of the milk and cinnamon. Champorado has cocoa in it, but I'm allergic to chocolate. So, being able to indulge into this without worry was definitely awesome. This version even tastes like horchata. Rice, milk, cinnamon....yummmm.  They still reign for best greek food in my book, still worth the drive, and tonight's treatment just sealed it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND as always. The old lady at the front is so cute. Just not sure if she is the mama Kylkos.   Definitely kid and stroller friendly as it sits in a food court at the Galleria mall."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for years! They are so delicious and the service is great. I try to make it to the galleria every month just to go there. I love how its a family business and that the owners work there. One of the brothers is the type that remembers your face and always personally acknowledges you, great customer service! The chicken gyro plate is to die for. I travel almost 20-30 minutes just to have my Kyklos fix!!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" fast food. It is sooooo YUMMY! It is located in the food court at the Galleria mall.....I know...but don't let the screaming kids and crowds of people stop you for going there for your next meal! The food is amazing!  This placed is owned by a group of brothers. The food is authentic and everything is homemade...including their baklava and tomato sauce. They will usually give you a sample of whatever they are currently grilling while you choose your meal.  We always get either the gyro plate or a plain gyro. The food is so fresh and flavorful. I like mine with crisp, ripe tomatoes and yogurt. The pita bread is warm and chewy and holds the rice and homemade tomato sauce just perfect. HEAVEN.   They are a bit on the pricey end. We usually spend almost $25 for two of us....a bit expensive for mall food....but it is still worth it. You get what you pay for.   HINT: They have recently posted a groupon TWICE so keep your eyes out. We always buy the max each time. Yeah, that is how we roll!  When it comes to mall food I am officially a GREEK geek....with baklava on the side yo!"}
{"text":"5 stars aren't enough. The food, the crew and the management are top notch. I have been several times and get their Gyro platter every time. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Okay considering that this restaurant is in a mall they have authentic Greek food and if you're nearby I highly recommend you try it"}
{"text":"Kyklos has THE best Greek food anywhere. We have been patrons of this Restaraunt for many years now, and were invited back by Sophocles after our last visit a week or so ago.   The food here is always fresh and delightful. The customer service is unbeatable and the brothers really do treat you like family when you are here. I'm pretty sure we even met mama Kyklos last time, which is awesome.   You will never hear me say a bad word about this place - the food, service, or the people. If you want great Greek food, don't look anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'd say I'm more than well versed in Americanized Greek food, and Kyklos does a great job of serving up Greek food for the American palate.   Went in here last night after going with my sister to get her ears pierced for her 5th birthday (2/14/11) My parents, the fast food connoisseurs that they are made a beeline for McDonald's and Panda Express. Disgusting. I, as is my custom, made a beeline for the Greek food. If there's a Greek dining option, I'm all over it, even if it's a mall Greek place.   One of the guys behind the counter offered me a chicken sample. Not bad.  I was very surprised when I was told that the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) were filled with lamb rather than simply rice. That's great because I've had some expensive rice-only dolmades in Henderson that weren't worth the money whatsoever and it's rare to find a place that actually serves them with meat.   There were lots of options to choose from, and I liked that in addition to baklava, they served melomakarona (honey and walnut cookies) and kourambiedes (powder sugar dusted shortbread cookies.) It's nice to see a variety in Greek food offered over here, you know, something other than a Kronos gyro, steak fries and syrupy baklava that's been sitting in a display case way too long.   I settled on the Greek salad and the avgolemono (egg /lemon /rice) soup with pita  bread. It wasn't your run of the mill iceberg lettuce salad with a tomato slice, a crumble of feta and a few slices of cucumber, no, it had pickled beets (!!!) kalamata olives (watch for pits) pepperoncini peppers, a pink-ish dressing, along with romaine, purple cabbage, tomatoes and feta. It was really good.   The soup was tasty, but I would prefer if it had been slightly more tangy. It's a preference though because I love sour /tangy foods. For example,  I drink apple cider vinegar every day so... yeah, don't mind me.  The pita bread, which I usually throw out, was given to me at no extra charge (thanks!) and was wonderful. Awesome. Oh, and one more thing, your meal comes with a bit of \"wisdom\" on a little business card. It's a cute and creative touch.  The food was good and the service was equally great. Both guys behind the counters were personable, asking me if I had eaten there, where I was from, do I go to the Greek festivals, etc. etc. etc. Afterward, when I came to refill my water on the way out, the cashier followed up with me to make sure everything tasted right. I've never had anybody follow up with me at a food court before, so yeah, service was friendly and great.   Just like the name says, \"(Yelp doesn't recognize Greek characters),\"  ( which means: a circle, a cycle.) from start to finish, Kyklos goes full circle in delivering great food and service to their customer.  I'd definitely go back here and recommend others give this place a try."}
{"text":"Located in the Galleria Mall Food Court, so super convenient for us downstairs at T-Mobile. They have some amazing food and staff here. Always clean and friendly, fresh salads great gyros... basically everything on the menu is quality, fresh, and tasty. Tonight I'm having the gyro and Greek Fries again. The owner is almost always here, making sure that everyone knows he loves his place and his customers. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The food and service is great! The guy behind the counter doing food prep was generous with his samples and very personable. The lady who rang up our order couldn't have been more kind. We had gyros, grilled chicken salad (juicy chicken and a yummy sauce!) and baklava...all very delicious and very well made. Love this place!  HOWEVER: painfully slow! I'm sure that's because it's freshly made, and I'm in a hurry today, therefore I won't complain about it. Just know that our simple two person order took 25 minutes, which for a mall food court, is pretty slow. Not someplace to eat when you're on a time constraint. So come a but early and enjoy the excellent food here! We will definitely be back.  :)"}
{"text":"This place has always been the best. My fiancé and I have been coming since it opened. The food is always amazing, the staff are so nice and the owner knows us by name. It's not pricey, either! This is definitely our go-to at the mall."}
{"text":"Smallest portion gyro plate in town.  $10 for a selection of meat morsels overcompensated by raw onions.  Yucklos Greek Cafe."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT!!! I was at the Galleria this afternoon and they first ask you if you have ever eaten there before. And of course for me, I had not. So they offered me a taste of the chicken! Awesome!! I found myself not only ordering, but ordering the full size Gyro Fries.. WOW!!! it's awesome.. it's huge, good size for the price and I have almost eaten it all by myself.. must save some for later...  :) Thank you, you guys.. You all are awesome, and Your mom is great too!!! Have a great holiday and I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the whole damn world! (At least until I Actually go to Greece and then I'll have something to compare). Seriously, I've had Mad Greek, Sultan's, that place on Freemont street and nothing compares!"}
{"text":"We been coming here since 2009 , the food and services are always implacable, the staff are friendly  Gyro is our favorites and salad , price is very reasonable I would highly recommend kyklos Greek cafe in Henderson mall across from sunset stations  Goodddddd fooddddd"}
{"text":"I stopped in while at the mall and was excited and delighted to see a Greek cafe right here in the food court. Their signage will really catch your eye, and the customer experience is among the best I have ever had.   I got the Chicken Gyro and a piece of baklava, which were both perfect and reminded me of why I loved Mediterranean food so much.  I will definitely be stopping back in whenever I am in or near the mall in need of a quality, well priced meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place off & on for a few years now; I only wish it weren't in the mall's food court, and if it weren't, I'd definitely go more often. I'm sure the rent in there is cheaper than having a standalone place, though, so I don't blame them too much for that.  Three brothers own & run this place (check out their business cards sometime; they have funny titles). You can tell they care about it and they really enjoy making delicious, authentic Greek food for people. You can watch them cut their gyro meat off spits slowly turning in the back. Heck, you can watch them make pretty much everything. My favorite thing to get there is the chicken gyro supreme plate. The plate itself has chicken, rice pilaf, lettuce/tomato, and a touch of tzatziki, and the \"supreme\" part means they dump on a generous helping of white onion slices & feta cheese. YUM!! There's some kind of red sauce on the rice pilaf, which I've never seen any other Greek place do. It seems like it's probably tomato-based, and it's not strong, but it adds a little something extra that's very welcome (as you may have seen me say in other reviews, I'm kind of crazy about sauces). Their hummus is also EXCELLENT, served with fresh, warm pita bread. Really, the only downside to this place is the location; everything else has been great so far."}
{"text":"First off for mall food it's decent,  but if I was looking for true Greek food I wouldnt recommend them.  The gyro meat was salty and dry. The pita was great, soft and warm. I ordered the supreme gyro which I some what regret since the addition of the feta add more salt which it doesn't need. Also the price isn't worth it. Over all I'd you want Greek go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I tried Kyklos yesterday for the first time and I was completely blown away. The two men working, one whom I believe is the owner or manager, were kind, hardworking and I could tell just how much pride they have in their food. I got the traditional gyro and it was wonderful. The veggies were fresh, the meat was juicy. and the tzatziki was delicious. I also got a side of rice and mixing it with the sauce was heaven. I will definitely be visiting Kyklos each time I'm down at the Galleria."}
