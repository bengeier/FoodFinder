{"text":"It's ok I ordered delivery. They did screw up my order, I really hate yellow mustard. The tator tots were a bit greasy, and it took awhile for deliver. Wasn't great, wasn't awful."}
{"text":"A completely serviceable burger that took about 80 minutes to arrive. It was 3 1/2 star food, but I'm having trouble coming up with scenarios where I'd order again based on the wait. 

I'd suppose I'd order again in a situation where I really wanted a burger delivered and didn't mind that it would be more than an hour before I ate it. That said, Madison has a lot of faster delivery food and several better burgers, and I'd only choose MBC for lack of better options."}
{"text":"What is it with me and the newest grease pit in town? It seems like a pretty good idea at the time, and given the initial euphoria is actually kind of enjoyable. Then you might go back to it a couple more times, and it slowly starts to dawn on you...fuck. Fuck. This is gross.

They were on already uneven ground with me for their increasingly nasty ingredients, and now they've definitely passed that tipping point where I realize \"OK, maybe I need to delete this number from my phone.\" 

So the last time I placed an order for a burger from Madtown Burger Co, I called them up over an hour later, starving, wondering where my burger was at. Their response? \"Oh, sorry, we're so busy because of a Badgerbites special, it's ready and we'll send it out with the next car.\"

I ordered my burger off of Badgerbites. There was no special.

Having worked the back-end of a delivery place myself, it didn't take me long to recognize this as restaurant-speak for \"we never made your food and are going to start working on it now that you called and complained.\"

I called them back to tell them \"you know what, fuck it, you failed\" and they were more than happy to NOT refund my money."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here, and I was not pleased. First, it took an hour and a half for my order to be delivered. Like the previous comment says, their choice of sides are terrible. I got the onion rings with some weird powder topping, and it was horrible; I had half of one and that's it. There's other places in Madison that deliver burgers (I can think of one in the downtown area off the top of my head). The burger from Madtown Burger Co. wasn't absolutely horrendous, but I have had better. Overall, I don't think I'll reorder from them in the future."}
