{"text":"Fantastic food from the restaurant side and amazing selection of deli items! So yummy!! Fresh organic produce, selections of Eastern European specialties and the option for delivery make it one of my favorite places!!"}
{"text":"They have a grocery store, deli and post office.  The salad I order was advertised to come with Pita Bread, instead I got pita chips.  I also had two items to mail.  The person who runs the post office was not in today and no body else could help.  The said I could call him.  Who advertises a business and then is closed during open hours.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Their fresh Cheese Croissant is the BEST. I had to come back immediately after tried one and got another 10"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken breast kabob plate for lunch... just as good and $5 cheaper than the middle eastern restaurant in the same shopping plaza. The owner is friendly and they make the food fresh. Next time I will call and order ahead, but I will definately be going back. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in hoping to find Turkish style food.  Try the Armenian pizza.  Tangy and tasty tomato paste.  The crunchie crusty bread is delicious. Only 90 cents a 'slice'.  I'm looking forward to trying everything else on the menu.  The owners are a very smart Armenian family, and the rest of the store has a wonderful feel to it."}
{"text":"I drove past today, pulled a screechin' u-turn, and excitedly headed into this brand-spankin' new Eastern European market.   I was pleased to find the store had a solid offering of Eastern European and Russian foods.  I am not ashamed to admit that I am a Eastern European food addict.  Lucky for me, this place has the largest deli selection of any Eastern European store in Las Vegas.  The refrigerated cases have dozens of meats, salamis, sausages, cheeses, and salads.  They also offer a produce section that is refrigerated -- also a first for Las Vegas Eastern European stores (that I've seen).  They also offer baked goods from the awesome Natalia's Bakery located on Rainbow.  The packaged foods seemed mostly targeted to Russians, Bulgarians, and Hungarians.  I did see some familiar Polish stuff like Delicje and other Polish candies.   I was pleasantly surprised to find some frozen vareniki and pelmeni that I hope to try in the future.  And, dude, they have Dadu ice cream! DADU!!  It's the small things like this in life that make me happy.   The shelves were a little bare in some places and I hope they fill them out soon with a bit more variety of packaged goods.  I'm excited by their potential but, unfortunately, they don't offer many of my \"can't-live-withouts.\" I'll definitely be back to score some Dadu and to check out their progress.   Just keep opening the Euro markets and I'll keep shopping!"}
{"text":"I love Ron's market. They have a huge variety of Middle Eastern and foreign foods. The quality is great the people are very nice and the selection is very abundant. The store is also very clean and in a very convenient shopping location. I will definitely recommend it to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern/Eastern European  grocery in the southwest part of town.  I have been shopping here for nearly three years and have always been greeted by smiling and friendly staff. This family owned shop makes amazing fresh breads, dips, kabobs, and lahmejun (Armenian meat flatbread).  Was recently inspired to write a review from this giant green salad I got along with some of my baked items.  It was huge and fresh.  The meats are great to take home for some BBQ or just have them grill the meat for only $1 more a pound.  They also have a great selection of European beers and wine you won't find anywhere else.  Some of my favorites here are the beef salamis and spicy sojouk, olives, cheeses (especially blue), carrot salad at the deli and sardines.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this little place! The food here is delicious and of excellent quality, the customer service is fantastic and the prices can't be beat. The Tzatziki and Lebni are the best in town and the grape leaves are authentic like my grandmother and I used to make together. I could eat the appetizer combo of dips and Dolmas every day! You can tell their the food is made with care and it is unbelievably delicious, I couldn't recommend Ron's more highly."}
{"text":"Thank you all staff ! Serving fresh meat. Fresh produce and deli . Appreciated new management."}
{"text":"I had to add this one to the Yelp list and give a review!  I LOVE this market!  I've only been a couple times, and have gotten several items from the meat counter and deli counter.  This place has everything Eastern European!  Home made dolmas, Vienna sausages, natural casing franks, all kinds of hard sausages and salamis, marinated meats, and every European side dish and condiment you could imagine.  I see a lot of Mediterranean and Hungarian items in there, but I'm not versed well enough in most of those cultures and languages to differentiate a lot of the items.  Needless to say, this is a gem of a Southwest find for anyone looking for those specialty items, or just some awesome goodies to throw on the grill!  I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for almost 3 years since i moved in here in vegas for this kind of Mediterranean supermarket, what i mean really is,the one selling fresh kabob lule meats!!! I love doing my kabobs and barbecuing it. So this place is really perfect for me when it comes to my Mediterranean dish! Staffs treated me perfect too! Helped me in my over all needs!"}
{"text":"Great place leaving Glendale California I thought I would never get to eat Armenian pastries again. To bad it's on the other side if town"}
{"text":"I've been to almost every independent or \"ethnic\" grocery in town, and this one is by far one of the cleanest. I like their lamb specials in the butcher area, and can appreciate that they offer six different brands of canned garbanzo beans. But I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here over another market.  Staff were present but did not offer any help. Register has a tip jar for cashiers, which I find tacky. Look for the half-off clearance cart by the front door. Most cans are labeled with stickers, which assures me that they don't jack the prices up and down frequently. Minimal produce area. Both fresh and frozen(?) caviar available, red and black at the deli counter."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING that you can think of Eastern European is here and they've expanded the market to add more!  Great place to shop for European meats, spices, canned goods, cheeses & SO MUCH MORE! First timer, very cool store!"}
{"text":"I love  to go to Rons Market , they have the best quality  products and the  best service.  I highly recommend  everyone to go there and see for yourself. They're the bast ."}
{"text":"Ron's is a local gem. They have a meat counter with fresh choices, a deli meat section with the same. They also fix lunch & dinner options. One can eat there or take out. They also have delivery. The bread is locally baked, vegetables & fruits are fresh. I bought some dried spices that were reasonable & great. Much better than bought elsewhere. They have varieties of shelf foods you won't find elsewhere. Friendly & helpful always. Please support this wonderful Grocery/Deli/Restaurant gem."}
{"text":"Wow! I love this store...I stopped here on a whim and ended up buying lots of things I never had before including Bulgarian Wine. Not bad!   The fresh meat selection looks great, even some already marinated... super excited they had lamb and it looked fresh and the prices seem reasonable.  Next time I'll get some lamb...This time I got a few different deli meats... included lots of things I've never had before.  So many eating and shopping adventures to be had here!"}
{"text":"Clean, great costumer service. Love their marinated meats for Bbq. When i have friends or family over and don't have time to marinate my own meat, Rons is where i get it."}
{"text":"I have been to Ron's a dozen times and have never been disappointed. The staff is helpful and the food is fresh. I haven't purchased everything there, but if you want grape leaves, or shish-kabob meat, then you can't go wrong with Ron's."}
{"text":"always fresh bakery.my hasband loves to buy marinated lamb and it's delicious!I'd love they got more deli."}
{"text":"I'm being too nice by giving a 3 star review here. It deserves 2 and 1/2. They have a deli area and a restaurant area. The staff wasn't very helpful or friendly and I wasn't sure where and who to order with. I walked to the deli counter and a guy said, \"Oh no, she'll help you order,\" and pointed to a woman at the cashier. Somehow another man just ended up taking our order. The people working there need to get that together. Anyways, I ordered a Chicken Breast Kabob and sat down. I waited around 30 minutes to get the food. The hummus is very bland, no flavor whatsover. My kabob meal that I waited a half hour for was mediocre. The chicken really tasted as though it was rubber. There's wasn't much flavor at all. I would never go back here for anything. If you want good Mediterranean food, go to Khoury's on W Sahara."}
{"text":"I am so glad my son said he was craving Greek!  We found this place because it was on YelpEats as closest to our house.    The gyros were great!  Packed full of meat that was fresh and moist. The Feta fries were very flavorful and had the perfect amount of feta.   I thought I had ordered Lebni but got extra Tzatziki which was fine.  I think next time I will try their hummus or babaganoush.  We also ordered Sarma - like  dolma rolls - cabbage, meat, rice in a lemon olive oil - oh YUM!    We will eat here in the future!"}
{"text":"Love this market, though the one's on Johns and Sahara are good too. Staff is always so cheering, helpful and nice. They have everything I need: buckwheat, cottage cheese, cheeses you can not in American stores, some Russian traditional sweets and salads, ryazhenka. I even buy only Georgian and Armenian vines there, just no comparison with any Californian. They even have some Arabic products, which are so familiar to me, because I was living in Emirates for several years. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy food. Great prices. Love the store. Thanks, guys, for a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yay! Another Eastern European market, but now closer and more convenient for me! If you've been to Jones Market in Chinatown, this is basically the same, except these workers here are way nicer! We got some Moscow ham and the lady asked us how thick we wanted the slices. After we told her thin, she did one slice and showed us and asked if it was ok. Not only that, instead of packing the meat in a plastic bag as most places do, she put it on a foam tray and wrapped it for us, even though we just got a measly half pound.  They also have a nice assortment of olives. :) There's also cheeses, sausages, caviar, even marinated meats and kabobs. There is a small produce section, and a lot of canned and jarred items from various countries. I was glad to find labne here. Not so hard to find in CA but didn't find any in Vegas. Also they have Dadu ice cream! I usually don't eat sweets, so I love these, not too sweet like American ice cream.  A few things are more pricey than Jones, like the pickled turnips, but overall prices here are very good. It's right around the corner from Wet N Wild, so we'll be stopping by after visiting there every time now!"}
{"text":"If you like old bread and green meat, then this is the place for you. We bought bread lavash and we had throw out. Stay away from their meats and their bread. Never again will go there. This place is sick and full of old crap. Not good. If there was 0 star I would give it to them."}
{"text":"Stopped by Ron's today to try it for the first time after reading all the great reviews and it did not disappoint at all!!  The food is very good!  The seating area is kinda small but I took mine to go anyway. Fresh food and great flavors. Small market attached with a wonderful variety to choose from.   Prices are very reasonable as well.   I recommend, this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"One of their delivery drivers attempted to run me off the road as he was pulling into the market where Rons is located.  I pulled around and asked the driver why he thought it was ok to run me off the road ( as two lanes turned into 1) while I had 2 small children in the car. He said he didn't care and proceeded  to complete his delivery.  I wanted to bring it to the owners attention so I drove around front and spotted the owner outside smoking.  I asked if he had a delivery driver, he was able to respond with Yes, I have 3. I then explained the fact that his driver ran me off the road and could have caused a really horrible accident and injury to myself and children.  I told him I just wanted to bring it to his attention so maybe he can speak to him.  He suddenly didn't speak a lick of English and didn't understand what I was saying.  I explained it every which way possible and he still denied the fact that he understood what I was saying.  He said \"NO ENGLISH\".  I find that really hard to believe.  As a store owner in America, you can't even understand simple English?! I doubt that.  Take pride in your business and hire people who actually give a shit."}
{"text":"I shop at Ron's Market for about 5+ years at least twice a week. Farm tomatoes have the best smell and tast! Just add French goat cheese and bread and you will have the perfect European appetizer! Store associate, cashier always stop and help me with all my questions and needs, customer service is excellent! Their prices are very good as well. I always enjoy shopping at Ron's Market."}
{"text":"Very very good...it is very clean and the people there are very very kind as well! I got the gyro and it was excellent! Their taziki sauce was the bomb! Sooo good"}
{"text":"This place is a solid gem. Their little restaurant and their butcher shop has great cuts of meat.   From their restaurant their gyros and lula kabobs are solid.  Their butchery has marinated ready to grill meats. You can ask them to grill it for you or you can take it home and make it yourself. I don't know how they marinate their lamb but all the cuts are tender and not gamey at all. Also their prices are affordable. A lot cheaper than Stephanos which is right across the street."}
{"text":"I would like to express my disappointment . I would give zero stars. What happened is that i went there to buy some sliced mortadella, 2 employees were there at the back of the store, one were slicing something and the other saw me waiting for someone to help me , i waited around 10 minutes then i started to go back and forth but non of them asked if i have being helped. I was the only customer there at that time.  One of them went somewhere in front walked by me and didnt say anything. The other kept slicing something. Finally she turned to me and asked if i needed something. When i said that yes she said that i needed to wait! So i went to my car and was about to leave but i decided to come back and i told the the guy the cashier if someone could help me because i wanted to buy some mortadella! He said: she is there and i told him that she said that i needed to wait  and she is slicing something. His answer was: if she is slicing something else you need to wait! I told him that customers should come first or your reviews are going to be bad! When i went back to him with my purchase he didnt say a word, not even thank you or sorry. That is not a way to treat a customer! Im very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I live this place. Reminds me of home! Fresh deli meats, and the vegetables are tasty and fresh too.  I love their pickles. Old fashioned European pickles. Yummmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"They have pretty much everything you'd expect in Armenian market , i liked it."}
{"text":"New owners at Ron's Market. These guys take pride of what they do. Everyone there is very courteous is located across from Southern Hills Hospital on Fort. Apache n Sunset. You can also dine in if you like. Will be back for some more Kabob's."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the variety and quality of fresh foods.  They have a lot of meats and cheeses that are difficult to find.  The staff is very friendly and the store is very clean."}
{"text":"We order's from Uber Eat's and this place does not disappoint! Amazing food every time. The chicken and beef kabobs were tender and flavorful. The garlic sauce is the perfect condiment to their kabobs. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I bought some mortadella and some Egyptian cheese from there, the mortedella was spoiled and the Egyptian cheese had mold in it. Nick (owner) refused to replace it or even refund the money.  *****this place would not refund, exchange, or replace anything you buy from there.  This guy had the guts to say that I left it in the sun. Guys, my home is the next light. These stuff been in the my car about 5 minutes.   Don't buy anything from there..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for that special mideaster ingredient or product, check here, they have some great stuff. If you just want some new ideas on food, check here, they have it.  If you want Kalamata Olives check, go here, the deli is amazing.  Fresh and powerful stuff in this place.  Organized very well, and I always try something new here. Its great, too bad it wasnt closer to my house, I would go here weekly, not its just monthly to stock up on spices, olives, rice, hummus, and sardines.  Selection and uniqueness got it 5 Stars here!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience of delivery food service I've ever had in my life , they said it would take them 1 hr to deliver and I live only 10 minutes away , the delivery guy could not find me after 11/2 hrs of waiting , and a bunch of bull from them , I canceled the order and told them to forget it , then the delivery guy shows up to my apt 21/2 hrs late and thinks I'm gonna take it !! Get outta here !!  It's been cancelled... and now their trying to charge my credit card 3wks later .. are you serious..  omg this place is horrible"}
{"text":"Even the best ifbb world champion buys his food from Rons market !!!!!!!!! Most fresh market in las vegas !!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice specialty supermarket. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for Middle Eastern, Greek, Eastern European products. The prices are fair and manage to beat some of the big chains (impressive for a locally owned place). The only thing that I would improve would be adding another employee or two. The waits weren't too long though. I'll be returning again."}
{"text":"We ordered about 12lbs of cooked shish kabobs (lamb, chicken and beef) for a party for our friends. The guy at the deli counter was so helpful taking our order, helping us estimate how much we should get so no one at the party would go hungry and offered suggestions for what else we could get for the party. We picked up the food a few days later before our party and it was hot and smelled absolutely delicious. Everyone at the party agreed the food was great and asked where we got it. Anytime we are hosing a party we will be coming back to Ron's Market for their deliciously seasoned meats. The dolma was also fresh and a great side dish for the kabobs. The market itself is also stocked with lots of great items.  I am so glad we found this place and that it's so close to where we live."}
{"text":"The food is great ! Come with salad and hummus. It was $7.95 but since owner change become $8.95. $1 more but good size ! Takes 20-25 min so better you call the restaurant  and pick up the food."}
{"text":"Every time we call we get great customer service. Whenever we've gone in they greet you with a smile and warm \"hello\". They have catered a few parties for us and delivered a few dinners too.  Our family loves their food. This evening we called to order dinner after 8:15. The woman who answered apologized very kindly and said it was too late which we totally understood since they do close at 9:00. We jumped in the car to grab fast food and before we left our driveway the woman called back and said they would be able to take our order and deliver to us.  She called their delivery driver and checked with their chef and then called us back!  THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Going again today. I love the Greek olives and feta!"}
{"text":"Found this place on restaurant.com and decided to try it.  We ordered tons of food, but it seemed strange to me since half the place is a market and the other half had a seating area to eat.  Then I realize most places are like that duh!  Our favorite was the chicken shawarma as the flavoring was just perfect.  Everything else was just ok.  Going forward I would just drive a block down and stick with stephanoes for everything else.  Check out the added pictures.  Did I mentioned the chicken shawarma, it's amazing. You'll be happy if that's all you ordered."}
{"text":"Impressive supply of many yummy things, including breads, lavosh, pastries, fresh produce, armenian meats and cheeses, special spirits/liquors, tempting pelmenis, and wow - their prices on spices is incredible. I picked up some Aleppo pepper for a steal. Wish I new about this place two years ago when it opened!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Lithuanian dark rye bread, this is the place to go.  Yes, it is frozen but when it thaws, it is just as good as I remember in Chicago.    Very clean and nice since recent renovations."}
{"text":"Great food, very delish and prices are very reasonable...under new management, staff are nice & friendly come & visit, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a solid Arabic food store in Las Vegas (ideally on the west side) for a hot minute now, and I was excited to check this place out. I was referred to Ron's by a friend of mine, who also happens to be Arab-American, so I had high hopes.   They had a decent assortment of meats and cheeses and their selection of spices was pretty good.  I found most of the things I was looking for and the people were nice.    Being from Michigan, where there are entire sections of town filled with Arabic food stores, I wasn't overly impressed with this one.  But...considering there are few choices, I'm sure I'll be back here.    I saw they have a restaurant as well, so next time I'll order some food and try it out."}
{"text":"What a great find for my Eastern European food goodies! The store is very clean and the gentleman at the deli/meat counter is very helpful and knowledgeable. The cashier and workers are friendly too, but I think you just have to say hi first. Once they get to know you, they are so warm and helpful.   I love the herring salad (aka herring-in-fur-coat salad) at the deli. It is a layered salad that has smoked herring on the bottom, shredded beets, shredded carrots, potato salad, diced eggs, and topped with a sprig of fresh dill. The gentleman informed me it is a traditional Russian salad that is usually served during New Year's Eve and served with vodka and beer. Luckily I don't have to wait until New Year's Eve for this yummy dish! The blinis are very tasty too. There is one that has a sweet cheese filling with is great cold or warmed up. The meat filled one is delicious. The ground meat filling is well seasoned. Not too salty or heavy on garlic. He advised me to warm it up on the pan and eat it with some sour cream and a sprinkle of pepper. I took his advice and loved it! The baba ganush and eggplant dip are good choices to keep in the fridge for snacking or a side dish too. They also have a to-go lunch area. You can order kabob and rice dishes and gyros while you do your shopping. That way you have food ready by the time you finish your grocery shopping. Yay!  They also have a good dairy selection of kefir drinks. Kefir is a type of yogurt like drink has probiotics before it was a health buzz word. Try the baked kefir if you find regular kefir too tart. It's creamy, super thick, and very filling. The baked version of kefir is called Ryazhenka-my favorite. They also have European brand bologna that I really enjoy and cannot find elsewhere since the other similar market is going under repairs. Their bakery section has a good selection of tiramisu and honey cake sold by weight. So you can get a big or small slice if you want. Lavash bread, rye bread, sweet breads, and cookies are available too. If you like pierogis, they have a freezer you can scoop out how much you want-which is also sold by weight. There is also an isle full of giftable chocolates. Be a good guest and grab one when you visit your friend or family. They will like it and you get to have some chocolate while you're visiting. Wink wink.   All in all, I travel across town to get to these yummy delights. I can count on this place to stock up on these hard to find items and I found be the quality to be worth the drive. The prices are very reasonable and I am all for supporting local businesses. Give this place a try! You may find new favorites to add to your grocery staple!"}
{"text":"Ron's Market has been on my list for quite some time.  I finally made my way in and was pleasantly surprised with the size of the place.  It is divided into a restaurant and market.  I didn't have much time so I looked through the market aisles.  The market if filled with a wide variety of specialty foods for those who miss their European hometown foods or those looking to step outside their traditional meals.  I liked the deli and ability to get freshly cut meats and cheeses.  I will be going back just to continue to try new foods and expand my palate."}
{"text":"They make the BEST chicken shish kebob meal - with pita and hummus, a small greek salad and rice.  It is sooooo good that we now order it for our corporate lunches.  Great, fresh food and wonderful people."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday.  Food was fresh and very good.  I also bought a couple of items in the store area.  Very nice store and restaurant.  The only problem is that English is obviously the second language for almost everybody who works here.  It was often very difficult to understand what folks were saying due to some very heavy Eastern European accents and I wasn't always sure they understood me."}
{"text":"Nice to have a variety of \"other\" (non-Asian) ethic markets popping up. They seem to be offering mostly Eastern European foods which I'm not as familiar with as say German or Dutch food which is our familys culture. The one plus is the deli has some sausages and cheeses you won't find at any other grocer.   It's far from me, but if I'm in the area, I'll definitely grab from the deli. I also saw they have European style mayo in a tube. My MIL has been looking for that and funny, but I think it would make a great stocking stuffer for her."}
{"text":"We love to buy the pre marinade chicken, beef, and lamb shanks and throw them on the grill at home. Every single time we have a BBQ party everyone gives us compliments on the meat. The only credit we take is using a charcoal grill."}
{"text":"Anything u want is here. Staff is great. I been craving Mediterranean food and found this lil place in the way to the salon. Stopped in and so impressed  everyone greeting u with a smile. Food is great. Will be back when I have more time to shop!!!"}
{"text":"I have been in a few times to check it out. I always end up leaving with something delicious to try. I got a half pound of kalamata olives for $2 once. Delicious. Cute little place. The people working there always try to help you find what you are looking for or point out some thing new."}
{"text":"I would never shop here. Over priced and terrible quality of food and service."}
{"text":"I stopped in with some coworkers after a round of mini golf. The store is a combination mini grocer and restaurant. Great friendly service. The food took about 20 minutes but was very good and in decent portions. I will definitely stop in again to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Great little find  Tucked away  Armenian like food  Like canned and fresh deli and pita  breads  Check it out  So yummy"}
{"text":"I do like this store but ice cream there look liked shit , plus it's not cheap ice cream . I always end buying this ice cream bc my kids want them but when we get home and open ice cream it's look like shit , it's crumpled, been melted , all  covered with ice  , and when you try to eat it's test like paper not even ice cream"}
{"text":"Great customer service , bright, open clean . Armenia was wonderful showing us different selections in addition to the Serbian cuisine we came for . Super cheap Mexico Coca Cola and German bread (similar to pogacha) were great to add to a meal . Store is incredibly fresh and the meat counter is affordable and appealing. We will try the cafe next time with our girls!"}
{"text":"If I could give them -1 start, I would!  I bought there some caviar, and went straight home after that, when I open the can it smelled terrible and even had some bubbles on it. I came right back to the store so I can refund that defective product, and the owner refused to take it back, telling me that it's my fault! He was very rude, disrespectful, arguing with me in front of other customers with no shame! So embarrassing!!!!! I got it less then an hour ago, how can you even think of refusing your responsibility for the product you sell?????? What if I would get poisoned???? He offered me to call manufactory that makes that caviar and complain over there! This is ridiculous!!! Never EVER buying from this place again, this is not how you treat your customers!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the store they have ok products and they are pretty cheap. They aren't very nice or friendly to me be but I still like their merchandise!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! We get all of our butcher shop meat for grilling at home, they make great salads, and they have delicious baked items like the pastry filled with feta cheese."}
