{"text":"Stopped by Pow Wow for brunch after having had a rather stressful morning, and the guys working there were super quick to cheer me up and make a fresh batch of coffee. I ordered the Ojibway Beef and Cheddar brunch (with eggs) and with was, by far, one of the best brunches I've had in Toronto. And I've brunched a lot in the city. I will 100% be back and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good brunch and/or cheering up (haha)."}
{"text":"This 'Nish dish is so delish!!! You know the restaurants where you can taste the love in the food, this is definitely one of those places. Portions are generous and you definitely won't leave here hungry. Also maybe, it's just wintertime and my body is needing Vit C, but I find myself craving that Cedar soda on the regular. So good!"}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers, and we split the coconut chicken taco and the beef chili taco bowl. Definitely liked the coconut chicken as it was way more flavorful then the beef chili. And it was so large, that I couldn't finish my meal. Best $12 meal around!"}
{"text":"Waited for my sister to visit to try this place. I ordered the veggie chili taco. What came to the table was a beautiful towering stack of chili, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream carefully placed atop a base of a huge piece of fried bannock and topped with delicate sprouts. The bannock had a crispy outside and a fluffy, savoury and chewy inside. The toppings were packed with flavour and quickly warmed me up. Despite the deliciousness I was unable to finish it because of the giant portion, but was happy to bring home the leftovers.   There wasn't a wait because it was a weekday but apparently it gets quite busy on the weekend. The restaurant is cute and cosy and the staff were awesome. Learned the history  of bannock and how it is made from the chef. Looking forward to coming back to try the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian chilli on potatoes instead of the fry bread. So delicious, loved this place."}
{"text":"Tried the beef taco at the Fort York Aboriginal day festival. It was deconstructed native deliciousness had all the elements of a taco with a native twist. The strawberry juice was refreshing and not sweet! Perfect for an outdoor festival!"}
{"text":"Pow Wow Cafe, opened recently in the Kensington Market in Toronto, brings Indigenous foods to an already eclectic food scene in the market. The cafe has a patio outside and limited seating inside. The small but efficient kitchen is open so you can see the food being prepared.  Pow Wow uses Ojibway bannock, or fry-bread as the base for the majority of their menu items. Fry-bread has a long history in First Nations communities where it traces to the rations Indigenous people were given when they were removed from their territory by settlers.  The food at Pow Wow is certainly different from what I had many years ago while living in an Ojibway community in northern Ontario, Canada. The brunch menu is printed on a plank of cedar. Pow Wow brings a modern touch to fried bannock eaten in many First Nation people in Canada. While bannock could be heavy and dense when baked, the version Pow Wow serves is light, fluffy and fried golden brown.   Although the menu offers beef chili, veggie chili, pork or jerk chicken on fry-bread taco, we ordered off their brunch menu. We ordered smoked pork croquettes with poached eggs and tomato salsa, and poached eggs on fry-bread with smoked salmon and goat cheese. The smoked salmon dish we ordered had perfectly poached eggs that topped the fry-bread accompanied by a perfectly balanced creamy sauce. The pork croquettes were nicely seasoned and eggs were poached perfectly  Both items were really good and came with fruit, salad and peppery home fries.  Pow Wow has a limited choice of non-alcoholic beverages. We had cedar soda. While the drink was refreshing, I find it lacked enough cedar flavor. The service was fast, friendly and attentive. They only accept cash; I found that this somewhat annoying because I hardly carry cash. In my opinion, this cafe deserves affection."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place warms my northern heart. It's a short menu but all hearty and familiar with fun twists. The space is small (maybe 15 seats inside), open concept, and the staff will chat and joke with you, explain menu items, etc.   Most of the menu is based around fry-bread, and they do a great rendition of the staple I fell in love with while working on the rez. I started with a scone dog --a hotdog wrapped in it, and served with sage ketchup and cranberry mustard. The sage really did it for me, and it came plated with cedar, which is both pretty as well as culturally significant. I knew it would be too much food, but I kind of needed to try a taco so ordered the beef chilli one. It was beautiful and I regret nothing. A flat piece of fry-bread, piled high with chili, cheese, all kinds of veggies and greens and sprinkled with the petals of a few different kinds of edible flowers. I made it through about half and took the rest home. My friend had the dessert one, and I dont like sweets but the peanut butter sauce is heaven. It was a chilly day, and our server brought us some cedar tea (a traditional medicine for a reason) in cute mismatched mugs that felt like home.   Bottom line: I love it, and you probably will too.   Disclaimers: Cash only, they have an ATM in the back, if you are pretentious, vegan or gluten free this probably is not going to be your thing."}
{"text":"I recently ate the Indian beef taco and scone dog at the Dundas West Fest. After eating these abominations that this restaurant passed off as food, I can safely say that I've never more strongly disagreed with previous reviews.  The Indian beef taco was essentially a bad chili in a bread bowl. What qualified this dish as Indian or a taco is beyond my understanding. I could have overlooked the false label if anything in the dish actually tasted good. Shredded marble cheese on a bland chili is maybe something you could pass off to a 5 year old as a solid meal but I don't think anyone else would be interested in it.  The scone dog consisted of a bland beef hot dog in a piss poor scone. I doused it in mustard but that only took it from inedible to passable.  Maybe the food is better at their usual location in Kensington but this was a joke."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a recent brunch here on a cute 'n' sunny day!   I ordered the trout special with frybread, smoked trout, and goat cheese cream with a side of salad and peppery home potatoes. My friend got the frittata of the day - this time it was gouda and mushroom and it came with the same sides. The frybred bread was crispy on the outside with fluffy insides and the goat cheese cream could've been served by the glass. I would also the describe the frittata as fluffy. It got me a little jealous.   It's very tiny inside, but the patio will sit a decent amount of people for warmer months. The menu changes regularly, and is served up on a small wooden board that has the items written in permanent market. Open kitchen, so it's fun to be inside or outside.   Next time you're in Kensington Market, you know what to do!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time I had the clam chowder and second time the jerk chicken taco (I think!). Loved it both times.   Also they have tea made from cedar or pine and it was perfect on a frigid day. Aromatic and sweet and hot.   Service is lovely and chill. Such a nice cosy spot. I just wish it was bigger!"}
{"text":"Went for Friday lunch, we were luck to be able to get a table without waiting too long since there's not a lot of seating. It was my first time having Native American cuisine and I realized liked it.  We had: Three egg frittatas - which was yummy but not too special. Next time I would try the two poached eggs from their brunch menu instead.   Short stack of corn pancakes - cute mini pancakes, but again nothing special, I would get pancakes at a more legit pancake place.   Beef chilli taco - really interesting and delicious, definitely the highlight of the meal. I always like to try new food that I haven't had before. It was a collapsed taco with beans and beef on top of some bread. It wasn't oily or too heavy, I really recommend this item.   Overall experience was great, server was nice and friendly, patio was cute and put me in an amazing mood, World Cup was also playing around us which made the atmosphere even more enjoyable. Definitely think this is a place that people can try once or twice!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place since it opened and I read about it in the CBC.  It's only open Thursdays through Sundays, so be aware of that if you want to try it out.  It's easily located in Kensington Market, and contributes perfectly to the small-business ethos so prevalent in that part of the city.  On to the food.  We decided to try brunch specials, because Brunch.  I had the beef and cheddar frybread with two fried eggs, and my SO had the frybread with smoked salmon, poached eggs, and cream sauce.  The portions are huge.  The meals also came with a side of home fries, and a salad.  Both items were well done and very tasty.  I'm headed back again next week to eat lunch with a friend, so I plan on trying their more standard options for $12.  It might sound expensive for an \"Indian taco,\" but the bannock is absolutely delicious and the portions are really big.  Nice non-traditional combinations too, such as jerk chicken and pulled pork.    If you're in the mood for hearty cuisine with an indigenous twist, or just wandering around Kensington Market, I recommend checking Pow Wow Cafe out.  10/10, will be going again."}
{"text":"Fantastic Ojibway tacos! The fry-bread is cut up and is the foundation of the tacos that you order. Mine was the cumin spiced beef. Generously portioned with shredded cheese, greens, black beans, and sour cream. My vegetarian colleague loved his food too. We were all just so engrossed with the quality of the food that our conversation just ceased being!  Cash only and very limited seating. I will be back! Lots of customers kept coming in, probably because of the spot on Metro Morning with Matt Galloway last week."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing Amazing!!! Their pulled pork tacos are to die for - huge portions with really fresh ingredients. They have an open kitchen and you can see the chef freshly preparing your food. There were four taco options - jerk chicken, pulled pork, vegetable chilli, and one another option. It was my first experience with Aboriginal cuisine but I absolutely loved it. Very small and quaint cafe feel, all the tables indoor and outdoor were occupied on a warm Wednesday evening. I sat right in front of the open kitchen, the chef was welcoming and very curious to know if we enjoyed the food. You can tell he was passionate about the food and truly wanted you to get an amazing experience. Service was lovely - the hostess/waitress was attentive and ensured our waters were always topped up due to the heat of the kitchen.    There is only one chef that makes the tacos so it does take a while for your food to come if it's a full house. If you're seated inside, it does get quite warm because of the open stove! CASH ONLY. But there is an atm at the back of the store.    Will be back for brunch."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had brunch at the Pow Wow Café on a chilly Saturday afternoon. The vibe is extremely cozy and casual, with the kitchen centrally placed and wide open to the five or so tables in front of the window. There is apparently another dining room in the back but I did not see it. There is a reasonably roomy patio in front but at -15C that was not an option today.  I was seated right beside the chef/owner and enjoyed watching him gracefully and rhythmically prepare our food and that of the tables who ordered just before us. And when our food arrived it did not disappoint. My girlfriend had the poached eggs with smoked salmon which she rated 5/5. I had the brunch platter including duck bacon, venison and a little smoked cheddar omelette, which I also graded a 5/5. In fact my plate was so close to the chef that just after it was placed in front of me and before I had dug in, he piroutted, and without taking a step, and expertly dropped my little venison burger onto my plate in just the right spot from his spatula, mentioning that he had missed before the waitress had grabbed it. Both our plates came with ample portions of really really good, moist, homefries and exotic greenery with a zesty dressing and nice touches like flower petals and julienned veggies of what type I cannot recall. Neither of us could finish our portions, but note well that the fried bread which appears to be a focus for a lot of the menu did not go unfinished on either of our plates. Oh and a fresh fruit medley of blueberries, pineapple, honeydew melon and grapefruit. It was a feast. Somewhere in the description of the plates needs to include the word \"flourish\". It could go just about anywhere.  The staff were jovial and numerous, gathered in the kitchen eating takeout from McDonalds, a deliciously ironic juxtaposition to the wholesome and earthy food they were making for the rest of us. Even funnier, they washed it down with a communal birthday toast of organic ginger juice. Then it got better again - a customer asked them whose birthday it was and one of them replied that it was none of theirs, but it must be someone's birthday. There were about six of them crammed into the little kitchen area and honestly I would not be surprised if a couple of them were not actually working but came in to hang out on their day off because they enjoyed being there with their chums. But their camaraderie in no way interfered with the attentive service as I have seen it do in other such instances.  We are both looking forward to going back to try a few things from the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"IT'S A LOT OF FOOD. A lot of good food.   My roommates and I came here for brunch. The fry bread is great.   The cedar tea was delicious and like nothing I've ever had. I never thought I'd enjoy the taste of a tree. It smells like a tree!!!   It's small and cozy inside. There are three tables in the back so they can't seat too many people at once."}
{"text":"This is a great but very small restaurant in Kensington that offers some really delicious fusion food. We came around noon on a weekday and it was quite busy. We ordered off of the brunch menu which appeared to be very popular with our fellow diners. The service was very friendly and made our overall experience incredibly enjoyable. It is a little pricey, but I think the quality of the food speaks for the price. The menu items are things you won't be able to find at another restaurant in the area, and their fresh take on brunch food is absolutely incredible. Though the food is on the 'experimental' side, it is very approachable for any palate. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone as it is most certainly one of the gems of kensington village!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. So is the owner Sean. I'm very skeptical of eating bannock other than mine cause I make the best (jk ) but his is almost as good as mine which is astonishing HAHA. ;D great native food made by great native people. Authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"I came for the Jazz fest recently and I stumbled onto this place. Intrigued by their menu decided to try out their Indian Taco. To start with the the portion was massive with a base of the frybread topped with meat and loads of veggie condiments and herbs. It felt like a feast on my palate. I also tried the dessert which was also great. Would definitely come back and get more people to check out this place."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian tacos, delicious hot cider with spices and strawberries. Fun relaxed vibe. I'll definitely return. The decor is casual to schoolyard-ghetto, unfortunately undercutting the quality and vision of the food.   This place rocks. Now if only they can warm-up the digs."}
{"text":"This was such a wonderful experience! I went with 5 friends for brunch on a Monday so it wasn't too busy. It is a small cute cafe that doesn't have too many seats, so come on a weekday. I ordered the duck risotto special and my friends had the tacos and also the brunch specials with the tacos. It was AMAZING!! All the flavours were so unique and interesting and the combination was exquisite. It was a very new experience and a fusion of so many cuisines. Definitely will be back to try the other specials and tacos! Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Super awesome food! I had the jerk chicken Indian taco - my wife had the beef chili - amazing! Huge portion, could barely finish it, but happily did, to get every last piece of flavour. Highly recommended.  Sean, the owner and chef is great guy, really friendly. His staff are equally cool and attentive.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! We had vegetable chili and jerk chicken taco. They were truly awesome! The bannock bread is unbelievable. Large, delicious portions. Our first visit to Toronto. We love the city and would definitely visit Pow Wow on a return trip!"}
{"text":"After having Indian tacos for the first time in Northern Ontario over a year ago, I have been wanting to visit the Pow Wow Cafe to satisfy my cravings. My bf got the traditional beef chili taco whilst I got the curry chicken taco. I'm no expert in bannock, but it wasn't greasy at all. Flavour-wise my taco had a tad bit of a kick from the curry, but personally I wasn't too fond of the mango chutney. The beef chili taco was quite good as well.   We went for dinner on a weekday, and had no trouble getting a table. I'll be back to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the service here it top notch. A friend and I visited on a Thursday evening, and even thought they were closing in 10 minutes, the chef was super welcoming and did not turn us away. We grabbed a seat on the patio since it was a lovely day to be outside, and the patio is much more spacious than inside the restaurant. The server was such a sweet lady who made friendly conversation with us. She was also attentive and came around to refill our glasses of water without being disruptive. (Bonus hospitality points for seating us with at the table with fresh glasses of water already there, without having to ask if we want water to drink. Little touches that make a lasting first impression!) We shared a Jerk Chicken taco. A delicious heap of fresh greens, black beans, chopped mangoes, salsa, tangy goat cheese, sour cream and tender spiced chicken atop a thick piece of a fry bread. The bread is a thick slice with surprisingly light texture, fried to perfection to give it a crispy golden crust. Reminded me of churros. All together, the flavours went well together. However, a big negative was that we found only about four small chunks of chicken. Not enough meat to justify the price, and not enough to make the dish fully satisfying. I will come back to try the brunch dishes."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and beautiful food presentation.  We enjoyed a quiet lunch here.  Small seating area in the front but dont be discouraged from eating in...more seats in the back!  They also cater. Share...eat enjoy! Best ojibwe tacos ever and ive had them in 4 provinces!  Hahaha"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places in Toronto. Great value and flavour. Really busy on weekend. If you come 30min after it's open, you will have to wait. Their famous brunch dish is the taco dish, which in fact is structured kind of like a Benny in my opinion. I had the Jerk chicken corn bread taco with poached eggs. It's by far my most favourite brunch dish ever. Note that it's cash only."}
{"text":"Pow Wow's Indian Tacos are one of my all-time favourite dishes. I discovered them at Hillside Festival where their sister restaurant The Flying Chesnut has had a booth for many years. They are always the first meal I eat at Hillside every year, so I was overjoyed to hear they were opening in Kensington.  Indian tacos are the perfect combo of soft but crunchy bannock topped with delicious chili, vegetables, sour cream and cheese in the perfect proportions. They have some interesting twists on the original tacos at Pow Wow, but the original is still my fav.  This is more of a takeout joint than a restaurant, although brunch on the patio in good weather is lovely."}
{"text":"Excellent ! Super endroit pour manger un petit bout en terrasse lors d'une après-midi ensoleillée !"}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss if you're not looking for it. While the restaurant is small, the owners have used the space very efficiently. Show up early, it fills up fast (especially the patio). Despite it being busy, the servers were very attentive in refilling our coffee. The portions are large, and the Ojibway fry bread is unlike anything I've tried before (and from a self-proclaimed carb-lover, this is big). I'd definitely order it again. Heads up though, the bathrooms are cramped and the light switches are located on the ceiling."}
{"text":"We popped by on a whim for lunch and were completely impressed! On the inside, POW Wow Cafe is a small, cozy restaurant that fits about twelve people snugly in the front and about eight in the back. The kitchen is nice and open so you can easily see every part of the cooking process, which will take us to our food!  I got the Jerk Chicken Taco ($12) which is less like a traditional taco and more like a plate of food served on top of light, fluffy and pull-apart-y bannock bread. The jerk chicken plate is peppered with diced mango and tomato, and also served with a good amount of greens, parsley and sour cream. I actually only finished half of it that day and took the rest home for leftovers. Alongside the taco I drank some home made cedar soda ($2) which was very light and refreshing and totally a perfect match!   My boyfriend also loved his meal and gorged on a brunch special that had poached eggs, smoked salmon and tasty, seasoned hash browns $14-15?). One of his poached eggs was cooked through and almost boiled but the other was perfect. His plate was served on a pile of bannock and with a large side of salad lightly tossed with a berry dressing.   Overall I'm SUPER impressed and will totally come back here to try the other varieties of taco, like beef chili, pork and more!"}
{"text":"Writing this review as I wait for my food. Service, so far, has been below acceptable.   I waited for over 45 minutes for a table in the patio, as I'm with my dog. The restaurant doesn't have any set procedure to write your name down on a list, creating unnecessary stress to the process of waiting for a table.   So when I at last took over a table (took over, because the hostess/server was not managing a wait list and assigning tables to people), I had to wait for over 40 minutes for my food. I ordered immediately as I sat down, and there were no apologies or explanations on why my food took for so long. There are literally 5 items in the brunch menu and I ordered one of them, so it's impossible to understand what could have taken them so long."}
{"text":"Yummiest brunch super cozy and top notch chef! Few tables so expect a quick line up depending on the day, worth it..great waffles and bennies"}
{"text":"I had heard many great things about Pow Wow Cafe but friends and I tried many times to check it out on during lunch and unfortunately it was closed. Thankfully a colleague who had recently dined there shared a very positive review of his experience and so off we went to check it out.  This place is tiny but quaint. There is literally enough seating for about 12 people. However where they lack in space they more than make up for in flavours. The menu is creatively presented on wooden boards. They churn out brunch staples like eggs benny, corn pancakes, frittata, as well as meat and vegetarian chili and taco options from their small open kitchen. The cuisine draws upon Ojibway influences, which is apparent in the fry bread and perhaps some of the game meat such as venison or duck on the menu.   I ordered the poached eggs and smoked salmon with goat cheese cream sauce over the Ojibway fry bread, served with salad and fruit. They had me at goat cheese! The fry bread had a delicious crunchy exterior but was cut open to reveal a softer brioche-like interior. The fry bread was a lovely vehicle for the delicious creamy goat cheese sauce, the eggs and the salmon. Unlike the thin, oily, rubbery commercially sold smoked salmon that you often find in supermarkets, the smoked salmon served here was thicker, firmer, meatier, and nicely portioned. The eggs were poached to my liking with a barely runny yolk center. Oh and those home fries! Biting into the crunchy seasoned exterior yields to soft pillowy potato interiors. Although the fry bread, potatoes and cream sauce were a little heavier texturally, the accompanying generous portion of salad and fruits helped to balance this out nicely. Initially I felt $16 was a bit pricey for what I would typically pay for lunch, but after eating there, I felt it is a fair price to pay for the portion of food served.  I'm so glad I didn't write this place off based on a few unsuccessful attempts to dine here, as this was one of the more memorable brunch places I've been to in a long time! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love the space and the friendly upfront service. Love that you can see Sean cooking and doing his thing as you're enjoying the dining experience.   It made my dc and myself so excited for the jerk chicken taco we ordered. Watching the perfectly golden brown scones (Bannock) being fried was heaven.  The dish itself looked like it was a painting. The bright colors and layout was definitely an ode to what i was about to enjoy.  First bite had some mango slaw, jerk chicken, goat cheese and a piece of scone in it... wait I'll be right back... had to relive that moment because it was absolutely phenomenal and drool worthy!  We cleaned the plate even though we were still full from lunch but I couldn't miss the opportunity to visit the Pow Wow Cafe!   The women who took care of us during our visit was so sweet and approachable!   Will be back to try all their menu items ;)  Looking to explore more into some Indigenous cuisine inspired meals, go on by!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Pow Wow a try as it was a newer restaurant and because we have never tried Native American cuisine before. We were pleasantly surprised to be served generous portions on top of some delicious bannock. The food was perfect and we walked out feeling super full and satisfied with our choice."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and had the veggie chili taco. It was amazing. Probably the best chili I've ever had and the bannock made a divine combination with it.  Highly recommend, looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late 2pm brunch on a Sunday. The patio looks lovely for the summer and the inside is only about 6 tables of 2 in the front but I believe there is more seating at the back. But the front where we were seated was nice, lots of window that let in a lot of sun. The server was friendly and nice. The interior was not the nicest, it felt like someone's cabin kitchen with a bit of college apartment mixed in, it felt a bit old and not super clean, I was seated by the window and by the window frame and edges was a build up of dirt and grime. But the open kitchen is nice where you get to see the food being made.   I got the eggs Benny on the fry bread with smoked salmon and goat cheese sauce ($15). The portions are huge here, literally a mountain! 2 perfectly runny eggs and the sauce was creamy - super good. The best part is the bread - so crispy and savory! With peppery home fries, a mountain of salad with pretty flowers on top and a good serving of fruit - you will not leave hungry!   I also got the cedar soda, which was odd at first because it tastes like a forest but the more you drink the better it really gets!"}
{"text":"Ordered the jerk chicken taco. It was huge, lots of fresh veggies on a puffy fry bread taco.    Small place. Tables outside too. They cook in front of you so you do nothing but drool while waiting for your meal."}
{"text":"Holy pow! It has become a habit to check out places to eat in Kensington when I'm here for a cheap haircut--a usual excuse to investigate a new shop bringing a hip twist to indigenous foods. The whole 'Indian tacos' thing is one thing, but visiting on a weekend I sure wasn't expecting brunch grub at the humble Pow Wow Cafe. The poached eggs dish ($15) was big and amazing--along with a salad, smoked salmon, goat cheese and fluffy Ojibway frybread (bannock), it is a well-balanced medley.  There is a small back eating area, though if you can score a table at the front, it's much nicer and you get to see chef Shawn Adler at work in the tiny kitchen. The whole vibe is welcoming and unpretentious, and fits in well with the rest of the Market scene.  Cash only. Also the cedar soda. Definitely try the cedar soda. You wood be surprised at how refreshing it is. Maybe I should bring my college Ojibway friend here someday and see what he thinks.."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian taco and tasted a bit of the chicken one. I found that the taco was bland and the ingredients don't really work. The sour cream seems to clash with the rest of the veggies and the underlying \"fried bread\" feels really heavy. The chicken that I tasted had an Indian (like India Indian) kinda flavor, not really what I was expecting. Overall, I'm sure others might disagree but the taco didn't work for me."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto, and I found this chill, little hole in the wall spot looking for some coffee because it was -2 degrees outside and being from Miami that's FREEZING cold lol. The waitress, Emmie, was SUPER friendly and went above and beyond to let me hang out for a little bit in the heat since I was freezing my booty off! We had a very lovely conversation and she made me feel extremely welcomed. She's also amazing at typography! Then, I met chef Saverio who was beyond kind, and showed me how amazing he was behind the kitchen. I didn't eat anything.. but I can say the food looked AMAZING and definitely made my mouth water. I did try the Apple Cider that was suggested and it was DELISH! Kimbo and I had a very deep, insightful and interesting conversation which really made me appreciate the culture of Toronto. Overall, I am BEYOND impressed by the hospitality I have received at this place! I will definitely make this my first stop whenever I come back. I 100% recommend this place to ANYONE who is looking for a chill, good vibe type of place!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after looking at the amazing reviews from Yelp. Be ready to be wowed. 4 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service.  My friends and I came on a Thursday afternoon around 5pm. I was looking forward to the brunch menu after reading the rave reviews about it, but found out they only served it between 11am-3pm daily. The other menu was tacos, but not just normal tacos, they were mountainous. Mega-tacos, which were totally fine too.  I came a bit earlier and waited for my friends. The server was really nice, came to chat, and served me water promptly. After my friends arrived, we were greeted warmly by the server once more with the dinner menu. We ordered and a couple minutes later, I was told by the server they did not have the Vegetarian Tacos for the day.  Instead, the server offered to serve anything from the brunch menu. At the end of the meal, she only charged me for what the Veggie Taco would of been! It was honestly so nice of her and the staff, and they really did not have to.   I got the 2 poached eggs served over their special frybread with salmon and goat cheese sauce (sauce!!!). It was savory, filling, and the best hangover food, even if you don't have a hangover.   My friends got the Jerk Chicken Taco. The mega-tacos are very flavorful, colourful, and super instagram-worthy.   Some of the best staff I've experienced in Toronto. I super recommend this restaurant for brunch or any time throughout the day!  Note: For those craving the boozy brunch, unfortunately they don't do that here, but they can definitely cure that hangover."}
{"text":"I loved my experience here. I had the pulled pork taco and my husband enjoyed their omelette, both were flavourful and well presented. Portions are very generous. We'll be returning soon! Congrats on your opening in Kensington Market guys!"}
{"text":"This cozy little spot in Kensington Market completely took me by surprise.   Generous portions, solid customer service and reasonable prices.  Makes it hard for me to not want to return right away. I tell you if it was warm out I'd be back there tomorrow. Cross my fingers summer comes soon so I can linger on their patio.  They utilize fry bread for their taco selections. Really worth a try. Portions are definitely filling so you can share but I suggest ordering a starter or maybe their  feature soup.  We ordered the coconut lime leaf curry with mango chutney. Not spicey but I think if you want it to be more they can adjust it. A delicious familiar curry flavour worked well with the fry bread. Part of me wants to have another plate of this but am also dying to try the other offerings.  The duck wild rice soup was phenomenal.  The broth was on point. I highly recommend this too. I really hope they have this more often. Loved it.  They offer a dessert made with peanut butter, bananas and fry bread. It was topped with cotton candy. That addition made me giggle. Heavenly. You may be full by the end of all this but your stomach will be happy.  Speaking of customer service.  I can't say enough for how friendly and considerate the peeps working there are.  They even brought out an Elmo blue blanket for me because I was uber chilly.  How awesome was this???  Solid. All round. Really happy to go to a place that executes a restaurant on every level."}
{"text":"Staggeringly enormous and delicious tacos crafted with love and attention. Tried the beef chili heaped on top of the deep fried bannock and festooned with fresh greens and edible flowers, the staple of every pow wow. The bannock melts in your mouth, no knife needed here! The super friendly chef will explain the food and that day there was a duck confit, and there was also an enticing brunch menu.  The cedar soda was a bit subtle for my sweetaholic palate. The chef said the owner Never Wants Anyone to Leave Hungry, I defy you to finish one of these massive tacos of deliciousness in one sitting."}
{"text":"A small cafe in the heart of Kensington. The restaurant is quite small with tables placed close together. Don't be put off by the minimal decor, the food more than makes up for it. Brunch menu comes on a wood board with a few options. I ordered the brunch special that comes with salad, duck bacon (delicious), sausage, scrambled eggs stuffed with cheese and this amazing fried bread. I can't even explain it, it's almost like a donut. So good you should try for yourself!!"}
{"text":"A lovely unexpected brunch spot in Kensington!  There are plenty of great eating places in this part of town, but Pow Wow brings it's own charm and cuisine to make it even more diverse.  The place is small and slightly cramped, so expect to wait for a table and to overhear plenty of other conversations. We came on a Saturday for brunch and had to wait for about 20 minutes for a spot , but spent the time with some hot beverages on their little patio so we didn't mind.   The brunch menu is small but legit. I had the smoked salmon poached eggs on fry bread and it was the best smoked salmon I've ever had. It was meaty, the texture was amazing and the smokey flavor was standout. I liked the fry bread because it didn't disintegrate but sopped up the sauces beautifully. Every plate that come out of the kitchen was piled high, bursting with color and looked amazing!!  Extra star for the team attitude they take to run the restaurant. It was busy but they were always cheerful. The cook even stepped out from the kitchen to take orders when he noticed that the servers were slower in getting to a table. Very impressed by the people working there!"}
{"text":"I was there for brunch, and it was amazing. The owner, was cooking and he was great. We had two specials: a bison burger and the turkey taco.  The servings are large and ingredients really fresh. The bison burger was very flavorful and covered in cheese. The fried bread was dense and tasty.  I really liked the home fries too as they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. We also had a strawberry soda and coffee, which were average.   I highly recommend this restaurant and will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I don't even know exactly what is in this veggie chili but it is amazing. Cool little place with great service and the best people watching."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner after hearing a number of positive reviews on this place.  The menu consisted of about 3 or 4 apps, and four different types of tacos.  We shared the fried smoked fish croquettes and a chicken curry taco.  We really didn't know what to expect.  The croquettes are made with the fish of the day, and ours was made with pickerel.  Seriously, it was SO GOOD! The exterior was nicely fried, and the inside was soft and mush with the consistency of mashed potatoes.  It came on a bed of salad and aioli. If I wasn't saving my appetite for the taco, I would have ordered another plate.  As we waited for our taco, we looked around to see what this taco looked like.  It looked like a huge mound of food topped with salad and some petals.  For $12, we didn't know if it was one taco or multiple tacos.  To our surprise, it seemed more like a deconstructed taco with a piece of fried bread underneath. Even though we were sharing our meal, I really did not want to share the fried bread.   I would highly recommend this cash-only establishment, and will definitely be coming back to try brunch!"}
{"text":"Yum! I ordered the vegetarian chili. It arrived as a towering mass piled high on a giant piece of fry bread. The fry bread tasted like a dense donut. The chili, topped with cheese and sour cream and other pretty produce, was a feast for the eyes and the stomach! I can't believe how full I felt afterwards. I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"If you are less than 6 people  looking for a great spot for brunch, this is the spot!   They don't love doing substitutions but I respect that!    Get the Bannock- it's legit  I got the frittata and it was memorable.  The staff is very welcoming and the kitchen is right there so you can get a sneak peek.  Come hungry."}
{"text":"Truly mind-blowing food.  I hope this place lasts forever."}
{"text":"Food was perfect for sharing. We ordered the Jerk Chicken Taco and the Sample Platter and it was more than enough for the 3 of us. You got to try the frybread \"bannock\"- which might come off a bit too oily but for some reason you just can't stop eating it! :D  Awesome Staff!!!"}
{"text":"This place. Seriously. Fucking come here. The staff is totally fun, kind, and unpretentious, serving artsy types, regular middle-aged dudes, this artsy Chinese reviewer, and a homeless guy with the same amount of respect for all.  Portions are huge -- and well worth the short wait and mid price (entree items cost between 12 and 16 dollars). Everything is fresh, handmade, and delicious. I got the beef and cheddar Ojibway taco (beef chili, sour cream, and other toppings on fry bread) with fried eggs on top. Potatoes have a strange spicing that's not unpleasant, but the salad is beautiful (the whole plate is, really). I got the maple water. At first, I didn't like it so much, but I'm finishing it now after my meal and appreciating the subtle sweetness. Too bad they were out of cedar tea!  I'll come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not what you expect and everything your taste buds need. Such a delicious mixture of flavors. Topped on ojibwe fry bread this \"taco\" will blow you away. So glad we found this wonderful little place."}
{"text":"I had tried this once at the Nameres Powwow, and they only had two types of tacos for the stall there. Had to go and try the actual restaurant - and it does not disappoint! There are a few options of bannock tacos that are the regulars (ie. beef chilli), and there were two specials as well (ie. curry!). The sizes are massive, and the bannock is served loaded with goodness, in large amounts.  I think there might only be one or two chefs so if it's busy, be patient and wait a bit - but it's so worth it!!!!!!!  The strawberry cedar soda was also delicious.  Definitely a keeper.   CASH ONLY. ATM available inside."}
{"text":"AMAZING! My friend and I went here after hearing so many posiitve reviews about this place. We went around lunch time on a Thursday so the brunch menu was available. We decided to share the coconut chicken curry taco and the brunch plate. They both were very massive and delicious  The presentation of the taco was atypical. The frybread served as the taco shell and was plated at the bottom and then piled on the chicken curry which had big chunks of lean chicken meat. The curry flavour was well seasoned - not too overpowering but enough to taste the flavour. Heaps of sourcream and veggies to top off the dish  The Powwow brunch platter was succulent. My favourite were the frybread and the scrambled eggs. The bread was crunchy with a soft interior and so tasteful unlike most bread. The eggs were buttery and soft and had an earthy flavour to it. I also enjoyed the venison sausage patty - wish they cake with 2 instead. Anything on the brunch menu comes with a salad and fruits.  I also got the cedar tonic which had a oaky taste which surprisingly was fresh compared to the flavourful dishes"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic brunch today. We tried items from the brunch menu - poached eggs, smoked salmon served over Ojibway fry bread and the beef and cheddar Ojibway taco. Both were very tasty, huge portions too much for our appetites but probably not for others. The daily special was a pike fish stew that looked delish. I hope this will be on the menu again the next time I am in. Staff are friendly and service was great.obviously we'll be back again."}
{"text":"FOOD - 3/5 Although the presentation of my dishes were far from mediocre, I really did feel as though the food tasted bland. I ordered the Two Poached Eggs and I felt that the fry bread was too doughy and thick. It then overpowered the salmon and eggs. The salad, potatoes, and fruit were tasted pretty ordinary. The fried duck egg didn't really stand out much as well and it tasted pretty normal. I did however, enjoy the corn bread, as it was sweet and savoury. The final dish we ordered was the beef chili tacos. It looked more like some sort of bland taco filling sitting atop soft bread. It was just okay and I wasn't a fan at all.   SERVICE - 5/5 Our server was very nice to explain the menu and addressed many of our questions and concerns. She was very attentive and routinely asked if we were doing good.   OVERALL - 4/5 I loved their patio and dining space. The restaurant is conveniently located in the Kensington area so it can be a great hang out place for friends. They have a unique brunch menu that lacks in flavour however you get your money's worth with the amount they give you."}
{"text":"4.5 stars ... a hidden gem in Kensington.  So before I go into the review more... please know that its CASH ONLY.  Yeah, I missed that part.   Now you know and don't be me.  Ever go to a place and you just feel the love immediately ... Pow Wow Cafe would be it.  The service alone makes it a hidden gem that needs every Torontonian to try it once at least.  The great part is that the food keeps you surprised and happy.    Like most things in Kensington, it's quirky but authentic to it's core.  Pow Wow is cramped and well, true to the neighbourhood.  It's well loved (bordering on worn through lovingly) and tight.  Like TTC King St cramped where you're afraid to move an inch and then be tagged for inappropriate touching.  It's part of its charm but be aware... don't come here if you have more than 4 people.  Not because you can't but you're going to wait a LONG time and really, there's not a lot of room.  The bathroom reminds you out of a scene from a super old cottage out in the woods.    As for service, absolutely loved it.  They're hilariously loving... you watch the chef, sous chef, and staff interact.  It's like watching a family but a hilariously loving and borderline dysfunctional family.  Commentary flies out and you can't help but smile.  They're so genuinely great here.  If every spot was like this, I bet you that Toronto dining scene would explode.  Everything is cooked from scratch and right in front of you... literally cause the kitchen is in the dining area.  It's that tight.  Their menu is small but well curated with their Ojibway frybread being the heart of it.  They call it Taco ... I call it a mammoth amount of food sitting on top of a fluffy tasty bread.  Oh another thing, they actually do coffee right here.  Most places I regret choosing coffee for brunch but this one was actually good.    Vegetarian Chilli 'Taco' - \"Taco\" ... its really a generous mountain of great food on their Ojibway frybread.  The crazy part of this brunch, it also comes with 2 eggs, salad, and home fries.  I asked for them to omit the egg cause I knew I wasn't going to finish.  The fries were heavily packed with flavour from the herbs.  And the chilli had some good heat in addition to spices.  Add in a pretty and healthy does of salad and you have my favourite type of brunch.  The fry bread is like a savoury yeast doughnut.  It was MASSIVE.  I couldn't finish.  4.5/5  Brunch Platter - Between the duck bacon, venison sausage patty, smoked cheddar eggs, fry bread, salad, and home fries, this was an absolute feast.  Nothing was lacking in flavour... bold, savoury, and well put together.  It did seem like a lot... ok it is MASSIVE especially with the fry bread.  Expect to take a second meal home.  Great price for the taste and love put into ti.  4.5/5  I cannot write enough about the staff here... they MAKE this place amazing.  Sure the food is a visual explosion of colours but the people do make an incredible difference.  I would say this is a must try for anyone who likes brunch."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good food at this tiny eatery in Kensington Market.  Brunch menu is inspired but don't forget to ask about any specials.  Unless you're lucky, be prepared for a bit of a wait for a table.  The place is extremely popular.  It's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love the staff. The chef came out to chat with us well. Friendly feel. Large portions and tastes great. I tried both the venison taco and the breakfast platter option. Both delicious choices."}
{"text":"Went to this place after a friend told me about it and was rewarded with a delicious taco and cedar tea! My meal was hearty, tasty and beautiful. You could tell that the holder of this space has really set the intention to create a space that shows pride in the food and culture that is represented. The owner and staff are super friendly and inviting. When I was there a lot of people came and went. I wish that they had taken a chance. Not only would they have ventured into enjoying a culinary delight, but they would have ended up learning a little bit about Indigenous cuisine and culture.  I hope this please continues to represent Indigenous culture in Kensington market and becomes a staple!  The only thing is that, I'm not sure how accessible this space is because I never ventured into the bathroom since the space is quite tight. I do hope that the washroom is accessible. Please see: \"The path to 2025: Ontario's Accessibility Action Plan.\"  Also, the service was amazing! And they serve a hot sauce that is very unique and only local to the Parkdale area. This hot sauce is akin to KFC's \"secret\" gravy in terms of deliciousness and mystery. I would put this hot sauce on everything!"}
{"text":"Amazing portions and menu options! There's only a few things for the brunch menu but each one is amazing. Seating is limited so come off peak or early! I've been here twice so far and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Top marks for this little joint in Kensington Market. On a street filled with unlimited options for dining - Pow Wow Cafe is carving out a big footprint with its big flavours, portions and service. Hours are a bit odd though - so check date and time before visiting.  ATMOSPHERE: This little shop is filled with warm and friendly staff. Super chill and cool vibe. There's very little seating (as typical for Kensington), but there is a cute little patio out front.  SERVICE: Wonderful! From initial welcome to goodbyes - they genuinely care about their food & you!  PRICE: With the generous portions, I'd say it's well worth every penny, nickel, and dime.  FOOD: Fantastic! A delicious mix of indigenous (Ojibwe) and mexican food. Thus far, I've had the Venison & Fiddleheads taco (it was that day's special), and the Smoked Pork taco (off the regular menu). Both were delicious. The bannock (or \"Indian frybread/taco\") used as the taco base is phenomenal in texture! It doesn't get soggy under all the sauce and toppings - but holds up well.  Definitely gotta come back to try everything else - especially their amazing looking brunch menu."}
{"text":"A must have in Kensington Market. The portions are huge and you'll walk away undoubtedly full. This mix of mexican/ indian is a unique blend that totally works! We had the croquette brunch and jerk chicken tacos. The greens and fruits that come on top of your main really complete the meal and make this a standout.    The actual space is a bit small and I can see this place getting full quickly on busier days. There is also some patio seating that seems perfect for people watching once the rare Toronto summer hits.    Great staff were very inviting for our first time. Our server walked us through the menu and made some great recommendations."}
