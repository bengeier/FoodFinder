{"text":"An amazing experience from a quaint little spot. Wonderful staff, open and cozy atmosphere, and amazing sandwiches. A must for weekend late lunchers."}
{"text":"First impressions: cozy, nice and friendly place for a coffee or some food. We came here by recommendation of friends for brunch. We all ordered the \"Stay Classy\" breakfast dish. The homemade jam that came with it was amazing, I hope they start selling it soon. Food was very good, must order the bacon. Will be coming back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hearty flavorful sandwich this eatery should be on the top of your list.  There aren't many tables, but they do takeaway if that's an option for you.  We were a party of three, all had different sandwiches and were satisfied!  Sharing a cookie at the end was the perfect topper.  Next time going to check out the sausage & deli counter.  I think it would be a great place for charcuterie too.  Staff was pleasant and service was speedy as well, definitely a new favorite!"}
