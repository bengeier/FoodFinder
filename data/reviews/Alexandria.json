{"text":"Nothing special but if you are hankering for some  falafel, gyros, and shawarma it will hit that spot slightly.  The guy was definitely friendly and they make sure you get what you want. The food looks fresh and it tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Sometimes...after a sweet Black Keys concert, and one too many $14 Air Canada Centre beers... a craving for middle-eastern cuisine will begin to brew.   Now I have to say (being a big shawarma fan)  this place does not offer the best shawarma in the city, but for $5 bucks, at the end of the night, it beats street meat every time... Totally 4 stars!  The restaurant needs to work on its atmosphere and food presentation (you'll know what I mean if you see it) . However the owner is super-duper nice, and this place does offer great value.  Recommendation; Stick with the shawarma (beef, chicken or felafel), and steer clear of the potatoes.  Sorry Alexandria, you knew what this was, your only beautiful and delicious to me when I've had a few."}
{"text":"What does a shawarma place have without good shawarma? Nothing.  Alexandria is open late to cater towards the late College Street stumblers but that's where the good things about this place end. The food is below average. The pitas are soggy, the meat (beef or chicken) isn't very tasty, portions are average and sandwiches aren't cheap.   Nothing stands out and I always seem to be disappointed after eating here."}
{"text":"After an altercation with the hot dog guy down the street we ended up here in need of food during a late night out.  The chicken shawarma was everything I needed it to be, and although their bathroom was out of order the guy let me come behind the counter to wash my hot sauce dripping hands. Since there isn't a whole lot of good and fast late night food options in this area, I can't help but suspect to find myself returning in future occasions so this place is a standard 3 star A-OK review."}
{"text":"This is a reliable source of somewhat healthy and always tasty food.  The guy who runs this place is SUPER friendly and very generous.  It's mostly shawarma and falafel, freshly made when you order.  The decor is simple but tasteful and new/clean.  I come here about once a week when up up in this area and hungry.  I can fill my belly with all kinds of goodness and for only $9.  AND, it's open super late: 2am most nights and 4am on Fri and Sat.  ATM in the store too."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma plate to go - my standard order. Everything looked really good, the chicken was cut right off the spit, the turnips looked pretty bright and were actual pickled turnip (not dyed cabbage or onion), and the lettuce and tomatoes seemed pretty fresh. The guy at the counter was pretty friendly and generous with the serving (a full square styrofoam take-out container). So I was pretty psyched about this meal, especially after reading the last review.  I started into it and I wanted to like it, I really did! Alas, it was not to be.. The major problem? Everything was too bland! The chicken was moist and juicy but tasted almost identical to plain Swiss Chalet. Hummus tasted like chickpeas and not much else (not a big problem really). The toum (white sauce) didn't have enough garlic kick. And most disappointingly, the pickled turnips were soggy and soft - not at all crisp - and tasted very watery. The potatoes (might have been some kind of frozen cut up deal) and rice (with lentils) were the tastiest part of the meal. That aint right!  Bottom line: Great appearance, large portion, bland food. I don't see the point of buying chicken shawarma that tastes like plain ol' roast chicken.  This would be a great place if you have a friend with a very sheltered palate who you would like to introduce to falafel and shawarma."}
