{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  I had the scallops.  They were cooked perfectly.  My husband had the hangar steak.  It was melt in your mouth good.  They brought him a knife but he didn't need it.  So tender.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My wife looked at me and said \"wow this place is in Lorain\"? This was after her first bite of her burger. The food is great, fresh, presented well. I'm liking the food so much I'm being selfish about liking it on Facebook."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The atmosphere classy and soft... The waiter was fantastic and attentive... Will defiantly return again and again! I throughly enjoyed my dinning experience here."}
{"text":"So good!  Suggest reservation unless you go early.  Had the filet and special (scallops and shrimp risotto)."}
{"text":"Awesome food and comfortable-attentive service. Best place in the Lorain area. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go about every 6 weeks for the last 3 years. The fillet is absolutely the best! You need to call for reservations though regardless of the day. We love the atmosphere and that fact that it's like a little secret. No one really knows about it and Mark has built such a great business that the slow growth and regulars always have it busy.  Gary and Cindy Engle"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Crab cakes for our appetizer. Delicious!!! My husband did the Diso burger and I had the salmon special. Everything was outstanding."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice people!  A real find!"}
{"text":"This place was. Real winner !! My in laws have lived in Lorain for over 65 years and never knew this place was here?? Thanks to Yelp and a call back from the bar tender me, my wife, sister in law and mother in law had a fantastic meal....."}
{"text":"A need to check out! Great service and food, awesome selection of beers and wines. We will defiantly make this a place that we stop by to become regulars."}
{"text":"I went to Diso's yesterday for the third time and I was blown away again. Both times I had gone before it was to celebrate birthdays with a group of about 8-10 people. This time it was for a private party and I wasn't sure if the \"catered\" food would be as good. They did not disappoint, everything was excellent from the bread (garlic pesto deliciousness!) to the filet tips. I've never been especially blown away with a potato dish but their roasted potatoes were outstanding - I don't know what they were seasoned with but they were fantastic. Oh yeah, and the bloody marys were very good too. The atmosphere is a little unconventional but likening it to a Ponderosa is pretty absurd IMO"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and awesome ambiance! The dinners are mouth-watering with great presentation and attention to detail. Everything is made fresh and in-house. The burgers are excellent, if you want a sandwich instead of dinner. Ask, Mark to make you a martini. The BEST around! Healthy food options, too. BEST spot in this area!!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple months ago for my birthday. I came in from out of town to visit my family and my parents brought me here as I chose this place. We had never heard of the place but decided to try it. When we walked in, it was very dimly lit and we were the only ones in there. We stood there waiting for someone to notice us as their were 2 guys behind he bar. They both looked at us and neither of them moved to seat us. So we decided to grab a table and as we walked to the back one of the guys began walking quickly behind the bar and said \"you can't just walk back here like that\". He asked if we had a reservation and I said no, we weren't aware we had to have one, we have never been here before. He then said all these tables have reservations except this one. I said fine we will take this one. He walked away and never came back to the table. When the waiter came to our table (he was the other guy behind the bar) he was very pleasant and explained all of our choices and said the other guy was the OWNER! I was blown away by how rude he was! Our food was awesome but I will never go back again. The owner greeted all the other people coming in and even went to their table to talk. The waiter advised if we ever came back to make reservations as people wait up to 3 hours for a table."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, romantic ambience, the perfect place to go with the one you love.  Excellent customer service, very pleased."}
{"text":"Very good !  Price is right !  Get what you pay for.  Cozy.  Small.  No tie required.  Best in Lorain ! Skins are the bomb !  Can I say bomb here ?!?!  Bread that came with meal is excellent !   We have tried several places for their steaks and this by far is comparable to STRIP (which is the greatest thing ever)!!   Salad could use an egg is the only \"complaint\" I have."}
{"text":"This is a place you would never find on your own. You definitely need to know someone who has visited before or you would spend a lot of time driving around looking for the restaurant (it's next to an abandoned sweepstakes building). Boy oh Boy though, when you get to eat it is fantastic!  This is a neighborhood place and a very welcoming one. The inside of this restaurant is dimly lit and has an intimate feel. The owner is usually behind the bar and he is wonderful to chat with and he has so much personality.  My boyfriend is a regular and we went for a light dinner and wine. We both ordered the specialty flat bread of the day which was  shrimp and pesto. It was wonderful and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. In my opinion the flat bread is large enough for two people to share.   I need to go back soon because their desserts looked phenomenal but I just did not have enough room in my stomach to try any that night."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is a real gem.  The food is great and the atmosphere is truly exceptional - especially if you sit in the bar area.  Friendly vibe.  You'd feel right at home coming here frequently.  And the food is so good. After I brought my Mom here, she liked it so much, she wanted to come back the very next night."}
{"text":"The potato skins are great. Very different from the kind you get everywhere else. I don't remember what was in it but it was solid. The house salad dressing is very good also. I had the hanger steak and it was done very good. The potatoes served with it were amazing. The only thing from keeping this place from getting a 5th star is the amount of time it took me to get my entre. It seemed like they forgot about it. My app came out very quickly and then I waited for almost 35 minutes for my steak. I would come back if I work in this town again."}
{"text":"Had another outstanding dinner at Diso's last evening!  Four in our party...two had never had the pleasure of dining at Diso's and were more than pleased!  Started with the potato skins that are unlike any I have ever had before...delicious!  And, oh, the bread that comes out before the meal!!  Three in the party opted for the hand-cut filet and I had the lamb with moroccon cous cous.   Everything was absolutely delicious!  Sampled three of the desserts - creme brulee, pineapple upside down cake and a very decadent chocolate \"cake\" for lake of a better word.  This is one of the best kept secrets in Lorain and I cannot wait to return!  Congrats, Mark Diso, on a job well done!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. The appetizers were amazing. Had shrimp scampi and had potato skins. The flavors were unique. The potato skins had a different flare. The shrimp were nice and large and the sauce was lovely. The table bread had a different style and went well with the sauce from scampi. We order a meditrain salad with salmon. The fish was sooo tasty. The price was price for a said though. We order a custome flat bread pizza. My son said it was something he enjoyed.. I ordered the burger. The burger was so big I couldn't even fit my mouth around it. Was pretty good. My other guest had the house special glazed pork chops. With brusselsprouts. That was delieciouse. Very nice large portions. Everyone had to go.  The house salad dressing wasn't my thing I like more oily based more of sweet thick base but to each own. The deserts that were offered sounded so lovely, if we had room to try them. The people were friendly.  Over all a nice little experience for Lorain."}
{"text":"The most amazing food ! We have had filet in many restaurants and this is by far the best ever! The price is great!!!!! We love diso!!"}
{"text":"This place is out of the way for a traveler but you'll be impressed when you make your way here. Great value priced cuisine is sure to please your wallet and delight your tastebuds. I am usually alone while traveling for work,the staff and locals welcomed me immediately upon sitting down at the bar."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight after reading reviews here & on TripAdvisor - while on a road trip. My husband and I both had an excellent filet mignon, as it is their specialty.  It is served with a delicious salad, asparagus & potato - & you order it by the ounce. We both have good appetites & the 7 oz we each ordered was sufficient, but it was so good we both wished we had ordered a larger serving. Flatbread with green oil is also served warm ahead of the meal & that is excellent too. (I actually thought it was pesto but it has no nuts in it.). We split a dessert - & my husband raved about their coffee. We each had a glass of wine. $70 for an excellent meal with good presentation that would have cost us a lot more in Massachusetts. From the number of locals in this small restaurant, I would say all the meals must be good. We did call ahead for a reservation & may have had an hour wait if we didn't. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm from the Lorain area and lived in Austin, Tx the past 6 years so I'm always bragging to my family about the amazing food there. My sister is always talking about this Diso's place and that it's her favorite. Of course I don't believe her that it's \"that good!\" So I came home a few weeks ago and we went... No joke, 1 of my top 3 all time favorite meals!! Everything was amazing. I loved that each dish was carefully thought out, it's not your typical restaurant where you pick side dishes. They do the entire plate so it all compliments each other. It's a bit pricey but nothing outrageous. Seriously, do yourself a favor and check it out, give yourself plenty of time as they like to take their time and make it more of an evening experience than just grab a quick dinner and head out. (alcohol, apps, main meal and desert for 4 we were there 2 hours) You may also want to call ahead to check how busy it is. It's a pretty small place so you may be waiting awhile. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Always great, attentive service, amazing food and Delish drinks! What more can I say? An all around great experience."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Lorain-Elyria area. Food is amazing! I always try the specials for something new and they are always fantastic.  The prices are average for food of this type. It's a fine dining restaurant without the dress code. The service could be a little faster, but I feel the food and drink selection make up for it. Great beers from all over the world are offered. The potato skins are a must! They are delicious! Make a reservation if possible because it is very small and fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Steak, pizza special, potato skins all excellent.  Mark was a great host. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"It does not make sense to me why or how you can get such delicious food in Lorain, but I tell ya. It is incredible. The atmosphere is super cozy. There can't be more than ten or Twelve Tables in this restaurant. The outside is very unassuming, I almost drove past it because I think it's in the building of a former Pizza Hut or something like that. But of course the inside is completely redone. You must make a reservation before just showing up because the place is so small. But I like that aspect of it because I really feel that I'm getting very personalized service from the wait staff and the chef. I had this restaurant version of surf and turf which was scallops and steak. It was absolutely divine. I don't particularly care for a red meat because there's so many people who do it wrong. And it's just so heavy to eat sometimes. I really have to be in the mood. But this steak would get me in the mood first take every time. I really can't say enough good things about this place. I wish I had taken a picture, but the food was gone before I remembered. LOL highly recommend it to anyone who is in the Lorain County area. And even if you aren't, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"What an incredible surprise. We stayed at a nearby B and B and heard about this place while having a drink at another establishment. It isn't much to look at from the outside but upon entering you are greeted by the smell of grilling steaks that will make a vegans mouth water. We decided to sit at the bar rather than wait on a table. The slow bar service is the only thing that prevented this being a 5 star experience. Not terrible, just not 5 star attentiveness. We had planned to order the scallops but after asking for a recommendation we ordered the potato skins. Superb choice not to be missed. Our salads were good and fresh but what really matters is the main course. We both went with the filets and they were incredibly good. Also, very reasonably priced. By all means, if in the area eat here. If you aren't in the area, it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. We had filet's done to perfection. Laid back cozy place. Great food!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome meal. One of the best hangar steaks I've had in a awhile. The herb butter was a perfect touch and the fingerling potatoes were nice and crisp.   Just a heads up, the place will strike you as a dive when you first get here but the food is anything but."}
{"text":"My first visit.   So happy with OUR choice!!  Fantastic food, casual atmosphere.  A perfect midweek dinner out with drinks. We will be back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a dozen times or so. Never disappointed. Apps, mains and desserts are always fantastic! Best in Lorain!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We rave about it to our friends and have actually brought some couples with us. Mark is a great host and it's great that it's a hidden gem in lorain. Try the potato skins (to die for) and when they have a special entree try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We are frequents fliers here. In my opinion, there is NO better food and service combo in Northern Ohio. I'd go with the Filet. Also try the Meatloaf when they have it (it is based with ground filet).   Mark and the staff demonstrate perhaps the MOST important duty of a server/tender, they don't rush you! In fact, plan on spending 2 hours here. I recommend sitting at the bar and shooting the breeze with Mark, staff, or other patrons.  This is a true Hidden Gem in Northern Ohio."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and heard everyone raving about this place so had to try it.   We made reservations as we heard the dining room is small, which it is.  The bar area is very nice, and the dining room area is cozy.  Our server was fantastic and gave some good recommendations.   I had a cosmopolitan, which wasn't very good, so I was disappointed.    We were 4 people and started out with the loaded baked potato skins, which were fantastic.   They are made with red skin potatoes and lots of toppings.   Super yummy!   I love risotto so we ordered the risotto balls, which were very good too, but not as good as the potato skins.  3 of us ordered the filet mignon which comes with potatoes and asparagus.   The filets were fine, nothing special.   They all came as we ordered and were hot and fresh.   The asparagus was very good,  but the potatoes were way too salty for all of us.   The fourth person got the salmon and thoroughly enjoyed it.    We took a pineapple upside cake home with us and it was very good.  Really liked the atmosphere, the staff and there is a nice wine and beer list."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night looking for dessert and a change of atmosphere in Lorain. Kinda testing the waters. First off, I Couldn't understand why the bartender wouldn't speak. One man answered our questions then told us to place our order with another. Ordered dessert and 2 coffees from the silent bartender. He handed us our watered down coffee without asking if we'd need cream or sugar then left to do something else. We had to ask for it later and received no spoon to stir with. The dessert was not very good either. We eventually found out that the bartender lost his voice, but you'd think they'd have explained that when we sat down rather than letting us assume he was just rude. I was very unimpressed and will not even dare try dinner service. As much as I'd like to support a local restaurant, for those prices I'd rather drive to Cleveland"}
{"text":"The nicest restaurant in Lorain hands down. Great ambiance and cozy atmosphere. The flat bread with pesto is a great treat before you get your meal. I had the filet mignon and it was really good. Cooked perfectly! Another favorite was the pork chops. The salmon dish was so-so. With my filet dinner I only wished it would have been served with mashed potatoes instead of seasoned cut potatoes.  The food was very good, and the service was okay. Our server never filled up our waters and we waited a long time to get our check. Once we got our check we were ready to go and had to wait awhile for it to be taken. For being a fancy, pricey place, I would expect the service to be better. Overall, a good experience with a great dinner. A nice spot to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Lets put service and decor aside, this is amazing food. Amazing like you would get for twice the price in certain cleveland neighborhoods. Its a hidden gem for lorain and i highly recommend it. Standout favs were the walleye and pineapple upside down cake. Skip the burger, though good, and go straight for the well priced steak."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! If I could give a 10 star rating for the food, I definitely would.  However, as you can see, I gave them a 4 star rating because the owner is very smug and is extremely unpersonable.  He is not friendly in any way  - we even attempted to make a joke with him to get him to lighten up, he ignored us you and was strictly business.    None-the-less, the food is so unbelievably great that I will absolutely eat here again and hope that someone other than the owner waits on me.    I ordered the 5oz Filet and it came with Asparagus and Lyonnais Potatoes and a house salad - D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S.!!  It was so freakin amazing that I wanted to lick my plate!  And, even though my dinner was plenty of food, I had to order the Crème Brule because I am not capable of refusing that dessert!  First of all, it was huge!  Not at all like the dinky Crème Brule's you will get from other restaurants.  Two people could actually share this dessert without either feeling slighted.  On top of the Brule, there was a huge mound of whipped cream and sliced strawberries.    My dinner partner ordered the chicken breast.  She said it was amazing as well - but I was so busy with my food that I failed to get any details about hers.  So sorry...  Now, other than the snarky owner/bar tender/waiter - the only other negative thing I can say about this place is it only seats about 24 people.  It's very small and tight.  For this reason, they recommend reservations.    On my next visit, I will try to remember to take some pictures before I wolf down my amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in early at 430 for the filet again.   Still the best filet anywhere, house salad and house dressing incredible, and flat bread with pesto is insanely good.   Way to go Disos 5 years later from my first review."}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about this place. I want to like it because everyone that I have spoke to loves it, but there is just something I don't like about it...and I can't put my finger on it.   I think the food is pretty awesome and tasty. If I was only rating the restaurant on the quality and taste of the food I would give it at least four stars. I do wish that the menu was larger and had more variety. Diso's is one of those places where you have to be willing to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new. If you are looking for a basic chicken or steak dish this may not be the place for you.   My boyfriend and I tried the potato skins with Boursin cheese, prosciutto and chicken as an appetizer. I would definitely recommend the skins...they were amazing! We both loved our salads as well.   I am not a huge fan of the atmosphere. Half of the place is a bar and the other half is a very small dining room. The prices at Diso's are that of a 4-5 start restaurant, but it's ambience is that of the local Ponderosa. If they could make some improvements on the decor and the table presentation I would be willing to give it another star.  Service was so-so. The waiter was nice enough, but not overly excited about serving us either.   Overall, Diso's is a decent place by Lorain's standards. I want to try it again and hope that I am able to give it another star next time!"}
{"text":"This was the first experience at Diso's for my wife and me and it will not be our last.   We invited a couple who are friends of ours and it was their first time too. The initial impression is not great. The neighborhood is a little dingy and the exterior of the restaurant fits the neighborhood well. The building is very small. The bar is the first thing you see when you first walk in. The dining area is open to the bar and seats about 24 people or so.   The dining room is very comfortable and the tables are spread apart nicely. Our wait-person was very attentive and friendly. Overall, service was very good. We all ordered cocktails, which were very good as well. The menu is pretty limited, but we each were able to find something we like.  We ordered two appetizers (risotto balls and potato skins). The risotto balls were very good and the skins were amazing! Three of us ordered fillets, which were very good. The lyonnaise potatoes were over salted, but decent. The fourth person in our party ordered the salmon and she was very happy with it.   Although pricey for the area, based on the atmosphere, service and quality of food, I felt that we received a very good value for the price."}
{"text":"The house Italian dressing is to die for and the salad was so fresh. The garlic pita bread is amazing. I have never had filet this good. The seasoning is amazing and it practically melts in your mouth. The garlic red skin mashed potatoes are fantastic. Don't skip dessert either. The creme brûlée is the perfect size with fresh berries and whipped cream. The owner is so nice and gives great service. Very cute small place that could be easily overlooked, but shouldn't be underrated! Seriously give this place a try! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we had been to Diso's and can say with absolute certainty we will be back. It has this great atmosphere, great service, and out of this world food.  We had the potato skins which are unlike any type of potato skins anywhere else. They bring skins to a whole new level. The homemade bread with the pesto was outstanding.  And don't even get me started on the filet! Not only is it cut fresh to size but it was the most tender and flavorful piece of steak I have ever had. Cooked absolutely perfect. My mouth waters for more just typing this!  If you're looking for a good meal, or a date night, or just somewhere you have never been I recommend Diso's.  It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for all around so it's worth every single penny!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Lorain. Our dinners were delicious. The filet and scallops and hanger steak were fantastic. The service was great and we will definitely return. We would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite restaurant. I always get the filet. An amazing value for such a well prepared , and great testing meal.  Great atmosphere. Mark, the owner, is always there. He is always very nice. Some great wine reccomendations.  Small quaint place. I highly suggest reservations.  I try to find something that a place can improve on, bit I find it hard to find something here. A true gem.  Maybe it could be in a fancier location, but then would it have it's charm?  Let's keep it the way it is:)"}
{"text":"Not just the best steak house in Northern Ohio, but period!  I have never had a steak that compares to the filet at Diso, and I've had many great steaks.  Usually I am a 12oz+ steak guy, but here I can be completely satisfied with much less.  Everything about this place is amazing.  The steak, the butter, the potatoes...everything!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steak!!! Best I have ever had, and had and had. Great service, fantastic price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic food and clean bathrooms! Definitely going to be a staple restaurant in our family!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place really good.  Been here many times and have not been disappointed yet.  It is more pricey than your typical chain places, but the quality and taste of the food is well worth it.  I will return here frequently."}
{"text":"What the...who else knew this was here?! This place is so well hidden it should be named \"Where's Waldo?\" instead. The only reason I even found this place was because of digging through Lorain's Yelp options. If I'd driven past it I would have never guessed that it was a restaurant.  But wow. What a great stop! Both me and my dining partner were very happy with our experience at Diso's. The service was great, the beer list was fantastic, and the food was beautiful and tasty!   The interior is charming, classical and semi-dark. The bar inside looks very nice, though we sat at a table instead of at it.   I had the salmon and my Dad had the 'cut to order' fillet. Both dishes were amazing and so yummy. The -only- thing that I would say is that the salt level needs to be brought down by a good amount. If you're at all sensitive to salt (personal preference/blood pressure problems) then make sure to request low salt in your food!  All in all I would absolutely go back. Absolutely."}
