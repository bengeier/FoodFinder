{"text":"We visited the PDG yesterday and I could not be more impressed. They were so welcoming and the customer service was the best ive had in a long time. The food was fresh and delicious and the atmosphere was entertaining for a squirming toddler. But the best part was the staff. They held our leftovers in the fridge while we went and explored the dino museum downstairs. They also called the manager of the museum and hooked us up with a discount on tickets! Totally went above and beyond for customer satisfaction. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Claimed to have Seattle's rating as the best fish and chips however; the first piece I sent back because it was way dry.  The re-did the order but not much improvement!  Suspect the fish and also their french fries have been previously frozen and fried then simply heated up to serve to their customers.  Wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"We went to the OdySea and we decided to grab a bite to eat. Boy, it was NOT our day. Lol. The value of our food sucked (sorry for such a harsh  description). Price was too high for what we got. This is when I wish I can time travel. My husband got a salad that was not worth $16. I got the meatballs but I've never seen meatballs shapped like mini surf boards. And I ordered a small pizza for the little guy. I value and rate restaurants based on 3 important things; price, quality, and atmosphere. Quality of food was decent. And the atmosphere was alright. It was pretty neat to see dinosaurs on the ceiling. See photos. PS. Sorry for the already eaten food photos. I forgot to take them before we started eating. It took a bit to get it and a crying 13 month old can't wait for mommy to take pictures of his food."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Adam and his staff are courteous and prompt, wonderful service!! Greek inspired but definitely not limited to. From the service to the specialty desserts! This is a must if you are visiting the aquarium or simply in the general area.  Decor is kid friendly, along with a nice menu choice for the little folks. The restaurant is adult inspired for fun date nights with or without the kudos. Experience it once and you'll definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Really poor service.  Came in with family for lunch after the aquarium visit.  Waited 30 minutes for our food order which never arrived.  They brought out some French fries with cheese that we didn't order.  Reminded staff and manager we were waiting.  Another 20 minutes goes by.  No food.  Ended up leaving.

Seems like typical situation they should address."}
{"text":"Very surprised by this spot.  We visited the Pangaea Exhibit so they offered us a 5.00 coupon for the grill.  The grill is pricy, but with the coupon it was a fair deal.  My 8 year old daughter and I shared the Chicken Soulvaka.  The food quality was surprisingly very good.  I expected \"Disney food\" but it was very fresh and a huge portion.  The two of us did not even finish the plate of food."}
{"text":"it was a total disappointment. Avoid at all cost. Terrible overpriced food. I had their award winning fish and chips and it was just awful, dry and tasteless. It came with no chips ( waitress forgot them)."}
{"text":"Don't bother! We thought it was going to be a neat experience for the kids after enjoying the aquarium. Wrong! The dinosaurs are ok, but all we saw were some dinos on the ceiling. The prices are crazy. We paid $9 for the smallest pizza ever and a milk for my son. It didn't even include a side. It was also $9 for 4 Tyson Dino nuggets, a few fries and a milk for my daughter. Ridiculous. And the new \"beer battered fish and chips\" was not appealing. It wasn't beer battered, it looked more like it was wrapped in a tortilla and fried. No flavor on the fish at all. They want $6 just to add chicken to a salad. That makes the salad $20. TWENTY dollars. For a salad. The best thing about the meal was the french fries. Those were delicious, both the plain and Greek style. So whomever they selected as their supplier for those was a win. Service was decent, but nothing special. Too many other good places around to waste money here."}
{"text":"Our food was good when it eventually got here. In fact I would order the falafel pita again. My husband had the California pita with fries and the fries are awesome! Service. Sever was not professional or attentive. Or knowledgeable. I asked about the falafel pita and she did not know. Had to ask for drink refills. Really would have given this higher score based on taste. Hope they get the service issues fixed."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the lamb kabobs and Greek style frys. Awesome service! The kids loved the dinosaurs in the air and we can't wait to visit the exhibit too."}
{"text":"Long and shorter. Sat within 5 min by a guy who was clearly pulling in people as they walk by. Greeted within 5 min and drink order taken. 5 min later order taken. After 45 min we ask where is our food, no real answer except \"its coming\" as she gives us a free order of fries. 10 min after we are told our \"food is coming\" i speak to a manager who then tells me \"there was a printer problem and our order wasnt received by the kitchen, they are making it now and it will be out soon\". Now its been over an hour since we ordered and our food finally arrives. Table next to us (mind you seated 10 min after us) was FINISHING thier food as we just began to eat. 

The food was ok. Cant expect much from a \"grill\" type place i guess. 

Now to be fair the server did try to apologize and offer remedies to make us somewhat less irritated. 

Situation could have been handled so much better tho. First, our server never realized we hadnt gotten our food in 45 min bc she never checked on us. Second, when we did ask about our food she should have been honest regarding the ticket problem instead of telling us the food was coming. (If the food isnt being trayed up to bring out...its NOT coming). Third, the manager and server both knew our whole table was irritated and on the verge of walking out but not once did the manager approach our table to address the issue.

They are located in a cental area of the Aquarium and Butterfly museum so they will probably still get lots of business but i wouldnt recommend it."}
{"text":"Was seated for about 10 minutes and in that time no one, and I mean no one, even so much as acknowledged our presence.  All the servers were mechanically going about their business, but not even one could say \"Welcome, be right there to take your order.\"  Not a one of them was remotely friendly or even smiling.  It felt as if they were all there doing community service time and wishing they were somewhere else.  Lousy service."}
{"text":"We came for the fish and chips. The waitress informed us they were out. Once I order was taken, tables that were seated before us received there food. When our food was delivered we still had not gotten and silverware.We waited 40 minutes for our order. Not a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service! We were seated quickly although in a small partial booth, not a great spot for 4 people and a highchair. Our waiter was very prompt at taking our orders but the food took a really long time and was fairly cold when it arrived. Other then the cool temp the food was great, highly recommend the chicken souvlaki, gyro, Greek fries and chicken Caesar wrap. Fish and chips were not great. It took a while to flag down our waiter for drink refills and the check, never recevied the drink refills. While we waited for the waiter to pick up the check and card a gentleman that I think was the manager started walking around, loudly asking if anyone knew where the broom was, it was weird! I guess they found it because a busser came and started sweeping around tables and at our feet as we were waiting for the waiter to come get our check and card. We waited and waited for someone to come collect the card. Never happened so I got up and went to a to a register and waited. Eventually we were told that only our waiter could run our card and he should collect it at our table. They had already seated people at our table as we were getting up. Our waiter was finally found and he ran the card, handed me the receipt for signature and then promptly disappeared again. 
Other than the food the whole experience was very odd and rushed."}
{"text":"I heard a rumor that this place (formerly called Opa Life) was owned by the same people who owned Daphne's. I was excited to try Opa Life because Daphne's was so good! 
I went to Opa Life and was so impressed with the food. A few months later I came back and the place had totally changed. 
The one thing that remains is the great Greek food. 

Be warned: this place is really hokey now and the dominant theme is geared towards kids. If you don't like kids, give this place a try. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Just had lunch for the first time, will definitely come bank. Amazing service, delicious food. A must for everyone!"}
{"text":"This is awesome.  Great chicken?  Check.  Salad PIZZA?  Check.  Giant dinosaur animatronics?  BIG Check."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this Greek spot to all Greek lovers. The service was fast and the food was amazing. Will for sure stop by again soon!"}
{"text":"Pangaea Dinosaur Grill was Dino-Riffic. Me and a group of friends decided to grab some food after visiting Pangaea Land of the Dinosaurs exhibit and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, friendly staff and cleanliness of the restaurant.  I strongly recommend this place as a place to dine and their pizza was amazing.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was extremely disappointing! Would never return, very over priced and terrible customer service. Our meals were incorrect, they never fixed them even though we had ordered the exact plate from the menu. The host was nice but our waiter was lacking in many ways. Food was not great!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Fast to be seated. Fast to take order. Slow to deliver food. Fast to deliver check. Then as soon as the check was paid they started clearing/bussing our table.  Swarmed our table like vultures. We couldn't even properly collect our belongings because they swarmed our table to turn it over. One of them was basically stepping on our toes to bus the table."}
{"text":"Pangaea: 

Server: Brianna W 

Im gonna start out by saying that I love and good new restaurant especially one I've never tried! 8-10 times I have a wonderful experience. My experience here was not the best unfortunately. After our order was taken, 25 min later our server came to inform us she had forgot to place the order. Which was an additional 15min on top of our wait which I was okay with. Until the food arrived.. My mother and I ordered Fish and Chips that both came out with the rest of the dishes at the table. Both Fish dishes were room temperature to the touch and slightly undercooked. You'd expect waiting this long to have your meal hot right? On MOTHERS DAY with very little customers in restaurant how can you make this mistake. (YOU DO NOT RUSH TO COOK FISH PERIOD) I try and be reasonable with service in restaurants since I run 2 of them myself. Our server seemed to not care so much about what happened and thought it was quite humorous as I watched her joke about it with her co workers behind the counter. I guess you can decide whether you'd like to eat here now or not. 

Thank you 
Alex"}
{"text":"Bald and fat owner lacked confidence.   I've seen it before in beta males of fish species...I really feel sorry for the baldness...here here champ...do another chin up fat boy"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST..I was full but had to keep eating!!!  The Beef kebabs and Greek rice were my favorite..my boyfriend had the shrimp and was in heaven!!!  The owner was so friendly and welcoming as well as the staff..I can't wait to come here again.."}
{"text":"Hubby and I brought our 15 month old granddaughter here for lunch while visiting the Butterfly Exhibit. It is actually an OPA Greek restaurant which suited us just fine as hubby and I both love Greek food. The interior is cute with animated dinosaurs hanging from the ceiling but it seemed to be very cramped. We ordered the dinosaur nuggets and applesauce for our granddaughter and she enjoyed them and they arrived fairly quick after ordering. Ours took quite a bit longer. I ordered the Gyro Pita with the Greek fries and hubby ordered the Greek Burger topped with gyro meat and tzatziki sauce. He chose the Greek salad as his side. My Gyro was really good and the only complaint I had with it was that it was so messy that the little flimsy napkins they give you do not help at all. I feel like I went through an entire dispenser of them before the meal was over. The fries were good and I liked how they were crispy even under the sauce. Hubby's burger was really good and cooked perfectly. Again though, better napkins would have helped with the drippings. We did have to order extra tzatziki and they brought it with no problems. His Greek salad was good however he had forgotten to request the dressing on the side and it was drenched with way too much in our opinion. Service was just okay. The times we did need something we had to flag down one of the waiters/waitresses as they all seemed to be working feverishly. Also, they only had one restroom for each gender and this was an issue as there was a constant line for the women's restroom - very annoying."}
{"text":"After spending a great afternoon at the aquarium for Mother's Day, we wanted to get something to eat. We tried the Modern Grove next door and ended up leaving without eating, and me almost in tears of frustration. See separate review. So for the sake of the kids, I put on a smile and we went to Pangaea. While I was collecting myself, my two teens decided to explain to the host that we'd had a poor experience and they wanted to make it up to me. They brought me a menu to look over and we all agreed it seemed promising. We were sat right away on the patio overlooking the bandstand and plaza. Our server was very helpful and friendly and didn't rush us at all. He recommended the fish and chips and was off to get our drinks. We decided we wanted to try a variety of appetizers to share, but also wanted to try the fish and chips. He recommended we upgrade the fries to Greek feta fries, and he didn't steer us wrong. There was only one piece of fish, but it was large enough that we all got to try several bites. We're not a tartar sauce family, but tried it with some of the tzatziki sauce that we got with tender pita triangles as another app. So so so good! Garlicky and fresh, and lighter than tartar sauce which suited the lightness of the fish's batter as well. The fish was moist and flavorful and not at all greasy. The fries were smothered in feta and parsley and completely addictive. 
We ordered a trio of hummus. Next time we might just get the regular which was some of the best we've ever had. The red pepper was ok, but not our thing. The garlic was delicious, but strong. Like ward off vampires strong. If you like garlic, you'll love this. Again, the pita was as warm and tender as a hug from your YaYa (Greek for grandma). We had to try the spanikopita, and this version was really great. It came with another small bowl of tzatziki which my daughter immediately commandeered as her own! I really hated sharing it and considered claiming it all for myself as Mom's prerogative on Mother's Day, but I decided we'd just have to come back and get it again. 
I was a little worried at first that the place might be geared too much for little kids and that my teens would be put off, but that wasn't the case at all. I can see my younger nephews and nieces really enjoying the dinosaurs and decor, but I didn't feel it was too much for an older crowd as well. The food was definitely able to please a foodie family, but would be great for people who just wanted a pizza or salad in a cool atmosphere while their kids checked out the Pterodactyls flying overhead. We were also really taken care of by the staff who turned around what might have otherwise been a disappointing ending to a great day. Thank you so much for making this Mom feel special!"}
{"text":"This place way exceeded expectations. The food is fantastic. I highly recommend the wings, the pizza, and the Greek club sandwich. The Greek salad dressing is also very good. My eight-year old daughter said the chicken nuggets were amazing."}
{"text":"All the food we got there was great. My favorite side dish is the Greek fries that came with our the beef and chicken  skewers.

We've been there a many other times and also really enjoyed the fish-and-chips, pizza and the Greek salad.

 This place has become one of our favorite destinations for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"It was good.  First time here I ordered the t-Rex burger and it was cooked well ! 

The seasoned fries are very different and good . 

Everyone enjoyed the food and the service was good . Although it wasn't busy. It's a small restaurant and the dinosaurs on the ceiling all move . So different experience and different type of food options . 

Will recommend to check out . 

Especially if you have littles that love dinosaurs ."}
{"text":"There should be an option for no stars! We were harassed inside which was our first sign not to stay. After he got us to sit down, didn't bother to give us menus or was interested in us asking him questions. Went back outside to harass more customers. Our server was very passive aggressive the entire time and not attentive at all. We basically had to beg her for a refill. Food was average gyro meat tasted nothing like it should be and was cold. Tasted more like dog food. Frozen chicken nuggets and a few fries for $6, really? Not impressed with the food. Service was the worst though. If you are constantly rolling your eyes at customers, you should've be a server."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  Not great, but good.  I took my grandson after visiting the dinosaurs downstairs.  The good: he was entertained by the many TVs playing children's programs.  The gentleman seating customers was welcoming.  The service was super fast which was nice when dining with a 4 year old.  I would guess the food was delivered within 5 min of being ordered.  The meh:  the food.  My grandson had the kids pizza.  It was sauce on a pita bread with cheese and pepperoni.  He didn't seem to mind as he'd eat anything that even resembled a pizza, but he only ate half, which told me how he'd rate the pizza.  And I had the grilled chicken sandwich.  The bun was nice and soft and the lettuce and tomato was ripe and fresh but the chicken lacked flavor.  It needed seasonings or grill flavors or something.  It was quite bland.  More meh:  most of the menu is Greek food.  Few choices for those who don't want Greek food.  Which I would expect had it advertised itself that way, but when a restaurant is titled \"a grill\" I've come to expect grill items.   The title should be Pangaea Greek Restaurant.  One more meh: we were walked past the dessert case to our table but were never offered dessert!   And they had baklava!   We were brought the check before asking if we wanted anything else, before being offered dessert and before asking for it.  It was placed on the table shortly after we started eating our meal.  Ok last meh, I swear...the cups were paper cups...like fast food cups...?  Why?  This is a restaurant where most entrees are in the $15 range.  The paper cups felt strange.  Anyway, all in all, it was a decent experience but I doubt I'd return.  There's other restaurants in that complex I wished we had dined at instead and probably will next time."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me! I'm not sure which was better, the food or the service! We had a party of 7 and the place was quite busy. It took only moments for them to accomodate our request for seating in the rear. Trey waited on us and did an outstanding job! The owner himself came to check on us and made sure that we were happy. Our food made it's way to the table in record time and was exquisite! This will definitely not be our last time eating at Pangaea Dinosaur Grill!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to take me to Polar Play for Mother's day,  When we walked by, the \"host\" almost harassed us in to coming here instead. Fine.We were hungry, and the Rain Forest dinosaur theme was cute. Once seated, we saw a bald employee (maybe a Manager?) bossing staff around, stressed, not happy. Our server was great, greeted us in a timely manner, and although they do not serve spirits (Vodka) he tried ....
We shared a pizza , only item on the menu that you could share, and had 2 beers. We weren't there long, but sat near the entrance where we could see \"the guy\" try his best to lure customers into the restaurant. Repeatedly.
Server came to ask if there was anything else we needed, and because we were done, asked for the check. We weren't quite finished with our drinks, when  \"the guy\" walked over to clear our plates. Then I got the nod. The nod to finish my drink! I was having a great conversation with my daughter when it was cut short by him standing over me \"encouraging\" me to finish my beer (and conversation).
Food was OK, but staff (excluding the wait staff) we're not OK. I didn't catch his name, but have a feeling if any staff or patrons see this review,  maybe they have had the same experience with this employee they should also share their experience."}
{"text":"We visited Pangaea Grill today after being at Odysea. We were sat outside at one of the picnic tables. We were a party of 5 (2 adults, 3 girls). We ordered our food and our drinks came out within a reasonable time for a busy restaurant. We ordered a our lunch which never came! After 30 minutes we asked the server to please check on our food. She came out 10 minutes later and said \"it should be it soon. It's so busy.\" We asked how much longer because we've been waiting for so long. Then she said \"4-5 minutes. Do you want to wait or leave?\" We decided to wait the 5 minutes. Nothing came. Every table around us received their food. Our 1 year old started screaming so we decided to get up and leave. A manager never came out to talk to us. I let the older man at the door know bar our food never came out and we waited over 45 minutes and he said \"Oh, Sorry.\" We had visited the restaurant many times when it was the Greek grill and the service was always great. It was wonderful when you could just order at the counter. They really messed up a great concept. Waste of an hour on this place!"}
{"text":"Great food & good prices! The greek food is great! The restaurant's friendly vibe make it very appealing & the employees are friendly as well. Highly recommend for a
simple meal or if you're visiting the aquarium."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was exquisite!! The salads were to die for and the chicken and lamb were melt in your mouth tender!! I will be back again and soon!!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  There is a bald manager dressed in gym clothes that was seating people. He was openly yelling at staff in front of customers and creating a really toxic environment. Our waitress was friendly and promptly took our order. But then came the waiting. People were sat 10 and 15 minutes after we arrived and we knew something was up when they began to receive their food.  We waited and waited. Our server said it should be soon. We waited more... and after and hour - nothing.  We finally said we would pay for our drinks and go. Our waitress apologized and said the drinks were on the house. An overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was just ok I miss the old place Opa :( I loved that kids use to eat free with each adult meal purchase. The service is what really make our experience unpleasant today we had just came from downstairs purchasing a couple annual passes for our family of four for the Dino exhibit and had Dino bucks to use which is a nice deal. But my food came out with fries instead of the salad I ordered. Not to big of a deal I had asked a woman not our server came out and Rudely dropped our food and I said excuse me I had ordered a salad with with not fries she rolled her eyes and took my plate away and returned. I had polity asked if I could trouble her from some silverware sine our table had none she went ugh and turned around cleary she was having a very bad day !!! Or I hope find a new job not being in the service industry. A bus boy came around about 5 min later with my silverware my husbands food was not good and he didn't even bother eating it he said it tasted so awful and just wanted to leave and go somewhere to pick him up something our drinks where never refilled and we were never asked how our meal was. This was our first time eating here since the changes in ownership and was very big disappointment :( my husband said he was so disappointed and didn't want to return. I'm hopeful that maybe it was just an off day and not the normal."}
{"text":"Ate here after visiting the aquarium. The food was decent but nothing spectacular. A little pricey but it's a great location with some outdoor seating as well as a big bar area. It was a nice way to finish our day from the OdySea and super convenient to just walk across the plaza to."}
