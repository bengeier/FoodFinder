{"text":"Really good ice cream! Great wide selection and also offer an assortment of cakes and pastries (which is a nice touch). They also have vegan ice cream. The server was helpful and cheery, so that definitely helped. Do try this place. It's right across the gurudwara in Massi Corner."}
{"text":"I used to go to Polka Dot Cow frequently, but now that I've moved, I miss it. I've only tried to their cupcakes, ice cream and gelato, all of which are good. Their prices are reasonable. Staff are polite too."}

Looking around my new neighborhood I was on the search for one of life's staples - Anything ICE CREAM!!

I happened upon this place on Yelp.. good on us! 

Had a treacherous drive during a thunderstorm and a flooded \"the gore\" road with my main man, and we both thought we were crazy to be out here, but we are crazy so let's continue...

Running into the Polka Dot Cow Cafe to escape the storm we were naturally the only one's in the place. Its bright pastel colors, the walls adorned with posters of our favorite childhood ice cream treats and ample cafe seating brought the sun inside. There is a beautiful display of cakes and other pastries on display - note they have egg-less, nut-free vegan cakes here. Will have to try them sometime... again we were on the hunt for ice cream cones. But my mouth watered at the menu: Banana Split, Milkshakes, waffles with ice cream! Yum! They even have Gelato! Everything on the menu is super affordable! 

Okay, focus! So, they make their own waffle cones daily and believe me, you can tell, they are so fresh! 
So with further ado, I chose a scoop of Pistachio Almond Crunch and a scoop of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. My guy chose a scoop of Gold Medal Ribbon, of which I stole of lick or two! :)

Creamy, not too sweet, just the right bit of awesome that real Ice Cream should be! 

It's not every day we have time to talk to the proprietor of a venue but this smiling, 60-something, white haired lady greeted us from start to finish and told us the story about how she always had a dream to own an Ice Cream Parlor! She says it brings her back to her childhood - her favorite ice cream? Good 'ol Natural Vanilla! 

Great to see no matter where in life you can always make dreams come true! Thanks Laura for following your dreams and opening this place just around the corner from me! :)"}

Great place for ice cream in Brampton. Very small. There's only about 6 tables (did not stand there counting).

There is ice cream, pastries and cake. Ice cream is not made in house. They buy their ice cream. You can get in a waffle cone, regular cone or cup. Waffle, extra $$ of course! One, two, and three scoops!  Ask for a sample before you choose your flavour. So many choices! 

The pastries and pies I think are from dufflet pastries but still very yummy!

Opted for two scoops. Cheesecake and fudge! They were great! Kinda think they can give a larger scoop for $8 of icecream but it was very satisfying! 

This place hits the mark for being central and easily accessible by the local neighbourhood however they can use a couple homemade items.  Perhaps baked cookies and make ice cream sandwiches!

Maybe I'll open an icecream shop next door and compete"}
{"text":"So boring. 

How anyone could rate this a 5 is beyond me. Boring, generic and lacks complete taste in terms of pastries. 

I have the ultimate sweet tooth and this place only disappointed. 

The girl behind the counter was sweet and helpful but it is honestly embarrassing the products being sold.

The ice cream was really the only thing I enjoyed as you can't really go wrong with that."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a few years since I always see it when I drive by. Finally I went in and got some cupcakes and chocolate mousse dessert. Very pleasant lady working there (not sure if she's the owner and baker.)  I am basing my review on the one cupcake I tried and it was EXCELLENT!!! Super moist cake and the raspberry cream cheese icing was to die for!! It wasn't the least bit too sweet.  Not saying I'm a cupcake connoisseur or anything, but I've tried my fair share of cupcakes in the past and know what I do and don't like.  At $2.50 a cupcake, I think it is a fair price. I've had other cupcakes for $3.50 and they don't even come close to the quality and taste that this place does. She told me they only use natural ingredients, which is nice because I had cupcakes elsewhere where they used artificial flavorings. 

I have 2 more to try plus the chocolate dessert too. My mouth is drooling just thinking about them sitting in my fridge. YUM YUM YUM!! I think I may need to get a birthday cake for my son here!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile and finally did recently during a cupcake craving! Pretty standard fare for flavours offered, so I picked up a Red Velvet (of course), cookies and cream, then a couple other 'mini cheesecakes'. 
The cupcakes were...a tad disappointing actually. Maybe I had built this place up in my head too much, but they were a little on the dry side and nothing special. I feel like I could get these from Fortinos. The little cheesecakes were nice but again, nothing crazy to write home about. 
Judging from the other reviews, I will have to come back when it heats up and get some ice cream...sounds like their specialty! 
All in all, a cute little place that I hope sticks around for awhile!"}
{"text":"THE BEST place for ice cream I've ever been to (and I have been to a lot!) $3 for a double scoop of deliciousness. I tried their Dutch chocolate and strawberry and was in heaven. I'm giving up on Baskin Robbins, Dairy Queen and Dairy Cream and HÃ¤agen Das. They're getting all my business needs for ice cream now. I'm so glad I found out about this place! Thank you Yelp (ers). 
Picked up some pastries too but I found it stale so I wouldn't get it again but check this place out for ice cream. You'll be so glad you did!!!"}
{"text":"Best italian pastries in the area. Tried various pastries and had a nice espresso. The prices are affordable too. Just wish they had cannoli :)"}
{"text":"I visited this cafe tonight. They sell La Rocca cakes and all of their pastries can be bought at Fortino's or similar. The difference is it will cost you about $10 less at Longo's or Fortino's. The lady that served me acted like she couldn't be bothered. We will never return. Those looking for a dessert place should head to Demetre's."}
