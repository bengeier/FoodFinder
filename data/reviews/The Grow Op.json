{"text":"This is a great spot. The owner cares a lot, and is chatty and nice when you go in there. My only qualm is the fact that they only do cold press juice (or so I've been told every time I go in) so you're kind of at the whims of what's in the display. I find the cold press juice is good - but it always tastes like something different each time. Sometimes it's salty celery, sometimes just flat old cucumber. When you're paying $10 for a juice - you want it to be awesome every time. Hopefully they'll get their recipes sorted out soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have consistently received great service and great drinks / meals. It's by far my favourite Acai bowl in the city, and pretty high up there for smoothies.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite acai bowls EVER!! Cannot recommend the peanut butter bowl enough. For those of us who love eating healthy but have the biggest sweet tooth - their acai bowls are your perfect fix. I enjoyed it from start to finish, which is rare with acai bowls as they tend to get bland after awhile. I must say the staff here is also incredibly friendly and the place is super clean!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here today, found the team to be very helpful with deciding on what to order since it was my first time. I ended up with a cold pressed juice (the red beet one), I would recommend it for anyone like me who prefers more fruit flavour in their juice. The sandwich was really good, but i waited too long before I ate it- now I know for next time. A little on the expensive side but I will definitely treat myself here again."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Açaí is mixed with too much ice, leaving a watery puddle at the bottom of the cup. Yes, the açaí bowl is served in a large plastic cup, with a plastic dome top, with a plastic spoon (we ate in). Cold brew was good. I'd recommend backing up your prices with a quality product and dedication to improving health, wellness, and a consciousness for our environment."}
{"text":"We were feeling a little lazy tonight not wanting to make dinner. We could have gone with a typical pizza order but I was craving a smoothie. We stumbled upon Grow Up in our searches. Really happy we found it. I got the kale smoothie with the sweet potato sandwich and my boyfriend got the cacao smoothie & falafel sandwich - so good. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I've been several times and have always been impressed by the quality of the food with my favourite being the sweet potato sandwich."}
{"text":"Went to try out the acai bowl for the first time. 10/10 would recommend and would get it again (even when it's cold out)!

Not in the photo but also got the sweet potatoes sandwich. Definitely one of the best sandwiches I've had!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place- so glad I gave it a try. I've had their cold pressed juice, sweet potato sandwich and the original acai bowl. ALL amazing, especially the acai bowl. Truly can't wait to work my way through their menu. So yummy"}
{"text":"Delicious food and atmosphere! I came here while on vacation in Toronto and this cafe's menu and food is amazing! It's a must-try place! I ordered one of the pressed juices which was delicious and refreshing! I also ordered the Strawberry Açai Bowl. Amazing! I have never eaten an Açai bowl that tasted so good! It is a very clean space, they have an amazing healthy menu, and many places to sit! It is a must-eat in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Delicious, clean, and approachable vegan/vegetarian joint at Ossington/Dundas.
We ordered the Zucchini noodle salad ($9) and the Sweet potato sandwich ($8.50). Both were filling without weighing you down - perfect options for lunch takeout.

I loved the Zucchini Noodle Salad. It comprised of shaved curly zucchini strips, spinach, almonds, and some sort of \"red-bean balls\", served with nut dressing. Refreshing, light and satisfying! 


The interior is spacious, bright and inviting. The owner is knowledgeable and friendly. 

The price is comparable to all the other vegetarian places in the 'hood, but their efficiency in food prep and gorgeous physical space put them above all others. 

PS. Pre-order or phone-in for your order, and pick up in 15min"}
{"text":"My friend took me here to try the \"amazing\" acai bowl. Little did she know that the north shore in Hawaii is the mother of the acai bowl and acai bowl food trucks and I happened to visit earlier this year. Gave it a 2 star only because I'm not a fan of sweets and I appreciated that it tasted fresh and natural. However, it is truly incomparable to the ones I had before starting from taste and ending with presentation. I recommend to give people the choice of choosing their toppings and create a personalized bowl. Add more fruit to it and maybe top it up with some maple syrup/honey/ whatever. We also had a chocolate smoothie and it tasted below average like they didn't get the proportions right or something. It was bitter and watery. Service was good!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Yummy juices. Yummy salads. Yummy sandwiches. This place is on point. 
And plus they've got a high chair sooooo healthy green juice for my babe."}
{"text":"Yaaa! So happy I finally tried this place out! 

First off- The name really makes me laugh especially because of the abundance of medical marijuana  places popping up in the city. So no- It's not once of those.It's a juice bar and it's serving up some great noms as well. 

I got the Falafel sammy and wow it's so good. I got it to go and I was really hungry so while I was walking I thought to myself I'll just take one bite and then eat the rest at home. Ya nope- I ate the whole thing while walking and I really hate to eat and walk. So you know I thought it was clearly amazing. 

Also the staff working that day were super nice too!

Eat here if you want to get warm feels after your meal."}
{"text":"The Grow Op not only delivers clean, raw juices but a clean minimalistic space as well. The smoothies are reasonable priced and are so super-food packed it could cure the worst of hangovers or deprivation of any kind. The 03. is like a healthy version of a chocolate milkshake and is easy to stomach after a night of drinking and gives you just the right amount of fullness and energy to keep you going all day. 06. Is an excellent choice when you need a pick-me-up and are in need of some vitamins; it's a basic kale smoothie but gets the taste buds tingling with ingredients such as maple syrup. BEWARE: smoothies may cause brain freeze. 

After being severely hungover and asking what I should get to cure the evil in me- the owner actually took pity on me and offered me a juice on the house which I thought was an unbelievably kind gesture. Can't wait to go back and try the acai bowl and take the perfect instagram picture against their titled backdrop. (PS. They tend to repost their customers pictures, one step closer to instafamous)."}
{"text":"The Grow Op is my new spot. I tried one of their smoothies for the first time last week and since then have been back four more times! My favourites are the #4 Smoothie and the Peanut Butter Acai Bowl. Everything is flavourful, healthy and delicious. 
What impressed me the most about The Grow Op is the great service. Everyone is friendly and polite.
There is also tons of space to sit and relax.
Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I got uber eats from here. My fresh smoothie and sweet potato sandwich arrived on time and was beyond delicious. 
Can't wait to dine in at Grow Op soon"}
{"text":"The people who work here are SOOOO nice. 
Shared the acai bowl with a friend, it was good but the \"acai\" part just tasted like purple ice. I really liked how it was layered with the granola and fruit and coconut. I would definitely go back to try a smoothie or the peanut butter acai bowl :). Yay."}
{"text":"After coming across different shots of the acai bowls and smoothies from this place on instagram I knew I had to try it. 

I liked the fact that there were seats for people to sit down (even with power outlets too, so maybe it could be a good option to come and so some work around here?). The aesthetic and the art work displayed at the place were really nice as well. Also, the staff was so kind and welcoming. 

My friend ordered the classic acai bowl which was flavourful and tasty, it did not disappoint at all. I tried one of their organic kombuchas, the lemon ginger one, it also tasted great. We also ended up trying one of their little desserts, they were in ball form and had chocolate in them. They were soft and delicious. 

I am definitely coming back to this place to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Place is amazing, good food and snacks on the healthy side. Kombucha on tap, cool art work and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The sweet potato sandwich with cashew cheese is easily one of my favourite sandwiches in the city. So good."}
{"text":"We really like all the food they make, especially the sandwiches and Acai bowls. There's lots of vegan options, so that's fantastic. Most of the staff is really friendly too! And the place is bright and nice, prices are fair. Tables were super sticky the last time is was there, like they get a wipe down once a day only but I know that the staff is very busy.

The only reason we don't go there more often is because the music is way too loud, you can't really have a conversation while you eat and I don't like the music either, sorry. ;) I feel like i'm in a club and since I find noise very stressful we always get takeout. Maybe try something more mainstream everyone can tolerate, at a lower volume? It could be an amazing place if not for the music!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Grow-Op a few times and it gets over the line on the food alone. It is a vegetarian/vegan place that specializes in acai bowls, juices/smoothies, salad bowls and vegan focaccia sandwiches. They also have some bottled cold pressed juice, hemp lattes, kombucha and other healthy snacks. 

All I have to say is that the food is delicious, and that is the most important thing. The vegan focaccia sandwiches are so tasty that you can hardly eat them fast enough. The acai bowls are also great and a decent size. I will say though that the peanut butter one needs more peanut butter further down the bottom. And the green smoothies are also excellent. I brought my vegan parents here and they really enjoyed the food (tough critics) as well as a friend who'd never had an acai bowl in her life. She loved it.

The décor of this place is nice and bright. It is very white and tiled. When I've been (generally after lunch) it has never been too busy so it is a little quiet/lacking in vibe because it feels a bit empty. It could be busier earlier in the day but I'm unlikely to know because I never make it over to Ossington before midday.

One critique I could make is that some of the staff here could be a little friendlier. The girl who has taken my order each time I've been there is not built for customer service. She is apathetic and cold. On my first ever visit they were out of quite a ridiculous number of things that I wanted to order and she just kept saying 'out of that' without any emotion or expression. Another time I asked her to wipe down our table and she blankly stared at me, but she did do it. The owner is much friendlier and I recognized him from the articles I read when this place opened. Even though he is friendlier and did remember me from previous visits I found that I had to engage him. I think if there is an open counter and it isn't busy you need to go out of your way to converse with the customers otherwise it is too quiet, like a library with a Vitamix or two. If the food had not been SO GOOD the interactions with the girl might have deterred me from coming back and bumped this review down to 3 stars. But it was, so lucky for them.

If you want something healthy, tasty and vegetarian/vegan leaning and you're in this area give The Grow-Op a try. As far as I know they are not too gluten-free friendly, or at least I don't recall this being marked on the menu. Oh and try the Reuben sandwich - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My favourite place for acai bowls!! They are choc packed with nutrients and there is enough in there for a lunch meal! I always order the peanut butter acai bowl! I love that they later it with a good amount of peanut butter, banana and coconut chips! They really do a couple of layers so that even when you're almost done you still have peanuts and peanut butter left :) 

The service is really nice there! They are sometimes quite busy on Saturday mid mornings but they will be sure to be friendly and ask if you need any help"}
{"text":"THE CHICKPEA TUNA SANDWICH. I know, I know, I need to branch out but I can't help it. This sandwich is my go to. Mashed chickpeas, sweet and tangy mustard, alfalfa sprouts, tomatoes and pickles on soft and savoury focaccia, ugh! It doesn't really taste much like tuna salad, but I don't think I would like it half as much if it did.This sandwich has also been the only occasion in which I have ever genuinely enjoyed pickles. AND it's reasonably priced!

The space is always immaculate and bright and tidy and the staff have always been cheerful and friendly. 

Lots of creative items on the menu - after reading all of these reviews though, it sounds like I'll have to try the sweet potato sandwich next!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The people that work there are super nice and the food is awesome! My husband and I split an açai bowl, kombucha and a Reuben sandwich. This was enough food for the both of us and was less then $30! The açai bowl was huge and delicious and totally hit the spot! The kombucha (lemon ginger) was local and 100% delicious (I am a bit of a kombucha snob)! The sandwich was yummy and 100% vegan!
I can't wait to get back to this place to try out everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you're craving something healthy, there are tons of great options in the Ossington and Little Portugal area.  Grow Up is one of the choices that can easily tempt you with really great smoothies, salads, and sandwiches.  Yes it's vegetarian but it tastes good and doesn't completely kill your wallet.

I'll address the 2 minor knocks on this place first.  Reading the other reviews, someone commented how the music is loud here.  She's not kidding.  It's VERY hard to have a conversation in here.  I would say the volume is probably 2 notches above a good fun environment.  Perhaps they do this purposely so you don't stay around too long but it's quite annoying.  Another comment mention how the tables are sticky... absolutely true.  It's quite gross to put your salad bowl down and when you try to move it closer to you, you feel the table tug back.  Ugh.  We were there first thing they open so you would think they would have cleaned it before they open or closed the night before?

Anyhow, Grow Up has a lot of great choices to give you that energetic burst or a nice filling meal.  I know some people may side eye at the prices but comparing to many other juiceries and salad places around Toronto, its actually quite reasonable.  

As for the spot, it's a fairly big space that has a lot of tables for you to sit and eat your snack or meal.  When we were there, no one but us were there.  Most people grabbed their meal or smoothie and took off.  Maybe they found the music too loud too?  The front space has a lot nice light so it never feels too dark in there.

Service here is prompt and quiet... they're efficient so I can't say anything negative here.  Once we got our orders in, they started to work on the salads and smoothies.  Less than 5 minutes, we got our first salad.

Mediterranean salad - filled with a lot of small baby kale and topped quinoa, tomatoes, cucumbers, lentil, pepper, olives, vegan feta, and onions ... it was a very full bowl.  We could barely shake all the ingredients with the dressing.  It was really fresh and well made with most vegetables chopped just the right size.  Right amount of salty and savoury from the dressing, vegan feta, and olives.  4/5

Asian salad - another great filling salad ... this one had lots of baby spinach, firm tofu marinated in a nice sesame dressing, finely cut carrots, daikon, beets and cucumber.  In addition to that, some edamame, avocado, and nori was thrown in.  The vinaigrette was sesame based and added a nice nuttiness to the whole thing.  I really liked it as it filled me up but also there's was a lot of nice crunchy vegetables to enjoy.  4/5

01 pineapple, banana, & strawberries smoothie - it also had maple syrup, lemon, chia seeds, and goji berries ... it honestly tasted like strawberry banana milk shake.  It was rich and smooth.. really well blended.  Seeing how it didn't have milk, I was loving it.  Definitely a sweet one but a good intro to the Grow Op.  4/5

07 Peanut butter, strawberry, spinach, maple, banana and dates smoothie - this was even more richer and creamier than mine if that was possible.  The peanut butter hits you and then you get a bit of sweetness from the banana and dates.  It kinda reminds me of a banana bread made with brown sugar and then you throw on a smear of peanut butter in the middle of it.  4/5

Seeing how neighbouring Parkdale is all about trying to be vegan, I think Ossington holds its own with Grow Op.  It has really well made smoothies and salads at a fair price point.  If they just lower the music a touch more ... it would be my go to spot for lunch a lot more!"}
{"text":"The Grow Op is a powerhouse of health food awesomeness located on the southwest corner of Ossington & Dundas West. Upon entering you'll be stimulated by the energy of upbeat (and unedited) music, friendly, knowledgable staff members, interesting decor, and the sounds of blenders that beat fruits and veggies into a pulp. Toronto-based graffiti artist Skam painted the caricatures on the walls, adding another dimension of cool to the space.

Smoothies come in many varieties and ingredients can be substituted at your request. Hemp milk is used primarily as the base for these awesome bevies. The prices are a bit steep, but it's worth it for the taste as well as the nutrients. Cold press juices are also made and bottled on site. Everything seems fresh and made with a passion for healthy eating here. You can also purchase acai bowls, salads, sandwiches, and other snacks that are good for you.

The location is accessible by TTC which makes it a great option for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you're near the area. If clean, health conscious eating is your thing, you definitely want to give this place a shot."}
