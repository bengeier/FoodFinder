{"text":"Been coming here for years. Great food with generous portions at a reasonable price. Breakfast is sold all day and it's too good to pass up. On top of it all the staff is friendly and efficient. Love this place."}
{"text":"Okay, so the food was really good for the most part.  Although, I ordered a hotdog and fries for my toddler and the hot dog was sliced down the middle and fried, so he wouldn't eat it.  Had i known they do that, I would have ordered him something else.  What earns this place only 2 stars in my book is the atmosphere and the way we were treated.  We came on a weekday during lunch.  the place wasn't busy at all.  It only took a minute for someone to come by and seat us.  Then they left.  without another word. The kids menu was full of syrup and was just gross.  A few minutes later someone else came by and gave us water and took our drink orders.  She came back with the drink orders promptly and asked if we were ready to order.  We asked for a few minutes more.  Then, another waiter came by and took our order.  At this point, we were a little confused as to who our actual waiter was.  Our food came out promptly.  The crepes were delicious. So were the hashbrowns.  My husbands breakfast of eggs and steak were good too, according to him.  My older sons BBQ bacon burger was apparently really good and was a huge portion. The fries were crispy, but you cant really mess that up. Someone came by briefly and asked how we were doing.  No one ever offered us refills on anything.  My little guy ate off my plate since he wouldn't eat the fried hotdog.  He dropped his fork with hashbrowns on the floor.  This is where it got really awkward.  We waived down a waitress and apologized.  She said she would have someone clean it up when we were done and it was no problem.  Then, a couple of employees and what I can assume was the owner, stood around, staring at us and talking quietly to eachother, glancing at the mess on the floor.  I mean, It's not like we did it on purpose.  They were outright giving us the stink eye for having dropped something on the floor.  It was so awkward, that my husband actually stopped eating and got on the floor and picked up the mess himself. when he was done cleaning it up, the waiter came by and dropped our check at the table without another word.  As I was standing in line to pay, the owner was making polite small talk with the customers.  When it was my turn, he didnt say one word to me except for the total of our bill.  It was just so...awkward.  He didn't ask how our meal was or anything.  I signed my slip and asked for change to leave a tip.  Again, not one word from this guy.  It was so flippin awkward that I couldnt wait to get out of there.  I see why a lot of people order take out from here.  Not to mention, all of the other customers seemed to be regulars and were treated so much better than we were.  I would order from here again but only for take out.  Never could I sit through another meal here.  From the beginning I just felt so un welcome here.  which is a shame since I live about a block away.  If the service had been just a little better, I would have given this place 5 stars easily."}
{"text":"I went here because I wanted chicken fried steak, but it looks like they have lots of other tasty breakfast foods too. The service was fast and friendly, and the steak and eggs were tasty with generous portions."}
{"text":"Fist time there. Did a Google search on nearby resturants and we are not from area. This resturant received a good rating. After going there we now know why. 5 start service and 5 star food. Your typical family restaurant, and we felt like family the second we walked in. Tracy out waitress hats off to you. You deserve to win the lottery with your kind heart you made us laugh and feel like we had been coming there for years. I had a salad and sandwich husband had salad and soup I've never seen bigger dumplings in a restaurant soup he said very good. We will for sure go back and highly recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Geeat service. Plenty of parking. The food wasn't great but ok, as expected from a diner."}
{"text":"heard it was great so my boyfriend and I gave it a shot.    it's a Perkins kind of diner, but a bit more homey.   the service had some room for improvement though.   I could see our food sitting on the warmer for several minutes before our waitress brought it to us.  (we were one of 3 tables, it was not busy)   waitstaff seemed more interested in Thier phones and gossiping with one another than waiting customers.  food was good though.     large portion for the price."}
{"text":"Parkway is very much a run-of-the-mill family restaurant that you find all across Wisconsin. Nothing is overly special here, but what they do have is really quite good.  I went last week for breakfast and got the sausage pan handle, with over easy eggs. The eggs came out rather cooked, but it was still a solid choice. Nothing worth writing home about, but quality, nonetheless."}
{"text":"Fantastic potato pancakes and pecan waffles  Terrible sausage and toast (yes I said toast) The sausage was odd tasting and burnt and the toast was burnt as well. The service was poor, waitress was rude. The water tasted kinda like a sewer-weird yes-I know  I am going to end this review on a positive note.  I cannot tell you how amazing the potato pancakes were- just like grandma used to make! The pecan waffles were probably the BEST waffles I have ever had."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious.  The service is outstanding.  Everyone who works there is very nice.  The breakfast is great and they have daily specials - baked cod, baked chicken, wonderful soups and salad bar."}
{"text":"Solid. Love this place.  Simple, straightforward menu with a ton of options. Very reasonably priced, and can't go wrong whatever you order. The staff are incredibly friendly and consistently on top of their game.  My favorite things of this place include the bottomless coffee without having to ask, large portions, and the fact that the staff bring condiments that logically go with food without asking. For example, of you get steak and eggs, the A1 comes without even needing to mention.  My favorite thing here is the pork chops and eggs. Two large pork chops, perfectly cooked, with two eggs any way, toast and hashbrowns. You also have the option of pancakes and fruit as well.   Though this place may not seem like much, I will tell you that there actually is a wait during peak times. But, due to the fast service, you won't wait too long."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times and the best I can say about the food it is better than average for a diner. What gives Parkway four and almost five stars is that the quality of service is well above average for a diner and the res truant is obsessively clean. I am always happy here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with my husband. No wait, got seated right away. We both got the sausage scramble. It was pretty good, on par with Denny's or Village Inn. However, the pancakes tasted stale, like they had been sitting in the window all day. And the coffee tasted like it was brewed with lake water or something. Just absolutely awful. Bathrooms are clean. But I would not return."}
{"text":"I ate here once and got confused because I thought it was Perkins, the sign looks almost the same and theyre right across the street. All the food was a bit bland even for typical diner food the staff was friendly enough though and their pie was a little bland but hit the spot. Overall can't complain but cannot this over anywhere else. If you want diner food and want to support your local restaurant and this place is a better alternative to Perkins or Dennys. If you don't mind driving a bit further Monty's blue plate or just search on Yelp for other local diners you will get a four or five star experience from the food itself."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try something different than the chain Perkins or mcbreakfast.   Got couple omelettes with hash browns and toast. Quick service, good food, and nice mellow atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is actually a great place to eat!  Definitely a family atmosphere as the wait staff acknowledges repeat customers and there are always familiar faces eating there indicating to me a good repeat business.  The food is very good, the portions very generous and the wait staff very efficient.  And the prices are very reasonable too.  We have always had good dining experiences here and have recommended it to others!"}
{"text":"Parkway is a great restaurant. It's been awhile since I've eaten there but eating there today reminded me what I was missing. Good food and fast."}
{"text":"If your primary interest in the culture of brunch is socially acceptable breakfast after 11am, this is the place for you.   This is a relatively low key diner. Servings are huge and the food is pretty good. I'm going through the stages of food coma from my country fried steak and eggs as I type this. Will definitely be back but maybe share a dish next time."}
{"text":"Food was decent-good portions. Maybe the sticky menu just threw me off."}
{"text":"Good portions, wide list of classic menu options for breakfast, fast service and kind servers. Parents come here often so they took me along this time and glad they did. I like a long standing local place like this with great grub  and solid prices. Even with the super cold day out we came on the place still had a good number of people dining in for a hit meal and coffee, must be good! Dads skillet was huge, moms cottage cheese crepes looked bomb and my pork chop and eggs were on point!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with the quality service I get at the Parkway. The staff is wonderful. They feed you well and it is alway delicious. No matter how busy they are I have never waited more then 15 minutes for food.  I would recommend the Parkway to anyone."}
{"text":"Parkway is the place to go when you are looking for a family friendly, unpretentious, straightahead, and good old fashioned breakfast.  Set just off the beltline on fish hatchery road, it is easy on-easy off with ample parking. Well lit with counter and table seating, there is plenty of room to go around. The waitresses are who you would hope to see in a place like this - - friendly, hard-working, knowledgeable about the menu and always ready with a smile and a refill for your coffee cup.  Blue collar, white collar, families, businessmen, lonely hearts, all seem to be welcome and are here.   The food is not gourmet by any means. But sometimes you just need the simple things done well with no-frills.  Pancakes, omelettes, burgers, steak and eggs. They have it all. Standby is the ribeye, hashbrowns and eggs easy over.    Come in, sit down and park it in a booth and watch the world go by on the Beltline over a nice cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast.  See you there."}
{"text":"Today, my husband, my mother-in-law, her boyfriend, my cousin-in-law, and I ate at Parkway Family Restaurant. Everything was excellent. As soon as we were seated, a server brought us ice water. (They even left a pitcher on our table so we could refill our cups as we pleased). We went at about 10 in the morning, but we could order breakfast or lunch. I ordered the crispy chicken salad. Everyone else ordered traditional breakfast foods. The food was fantastic. Parkway makes a fantastic salad. It's giant and they give you plenty of dressing. For those wondering about the actual breakfast foods, everyone that I dined with said that their eggs were cooked to their requests and that the bacon was perfect. Amongst the table, we ordered white, wheat, and rye toast. They were all three great. No one's toast was overdone or underdone. I am told the hashbrowns were quite good. The tables have salt, pepper, ketchup, strawberry jam, grape jam, Tabasco sauce, and Cholula (that's probably spelled wrong). The waitress was friendly and attentive. The service was quick. I would definitely recommend Parkway. I've had great service everytime I've eaten at Parkway. EDITED TO ADD: I forgot to say that we all received huge portions for low prices so Parkway is a great value for families/large groups."}
{"text":"First time here today came here with my partner. When we first sat down we were asked 4 times within a 5 minute period by 2 different waitresses if we was ready to order. I've been a server for a long time at a lot of different places this type of stuff this gets on my nerve. Its my first time here (granted there's no way you can know that) I need a moment with the menu. Do not rush your tables. People go out to restaurants to sit. Not in and out like a McDonald's. I ordered the Rib eye and eggs (scrambled) my eggs were a tad under cooked but not runny. I ordered pancakes instead of toast which were delicious. My partner had the 3 pancake special. Everything looked good and tasted great. The restaurant was clean and the wait staff was very friendly minus of course the rushing. I will return."}
{"text":"was looking for a non chain restaurant for breakfast while visiting Fitchburg area.  this restaurant is great!!!   huge menu matches the HUGE portions!!!  reasonably priced,  service is FAST.  highly recommend.  you see the same regulars there every morning-  sign of a good place!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the topped waffle with baked in pecans!  Normally not a sweet  brunch/breakfast person but it's a great waffle.   The chicken fried chicken is VERY good. The corned beef hash is average diner. The Benedict's are a little bready but good. They have sourdough toast!!   Quick service, flowing coffee, reliable diner for a low key but solid breakfast, brunch. Haven't come here for dinner or lunch though!"}
{"text":"Ordered a delicious Philly Cheesesteak for lunch a couple of months ago. It was very good and hot!"}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast and for their fish fry!  We Really like the taco salad as well. It is kind of a dive but we don't mind. Definitely give it a try"}
{"text":"In my never-ending search for food available during unusual hours, I came across this establishment. It opens at 4:30AM, which when combined with other restaurants that close at 3AM leaves only a small window of time where there is basically no food available in Madison except for horrible 24-hour places like Perkins. And what's better is that it has breakfast foods, which help me feel better during sleepless nights to think of eating at 5AM not as the previous evening that's dragged far longer than is appropriate, but as a fresh new day whose beginning I just missed.  I've gotten several different breakfast items here now, but every time I am always delighted by their scrambled eggs. Fluffy and moist without the chalkiness or runniness from too much additives, the scrambled eggs are always my favorite part of the meal. Also, if you get coffee they present you a large carafe of coffee, which I thirstily drink from like a famished water buffalo.  I really appreciate the diner feel of the place. It's like stepping into a Hopper painting, but instead of trying to wind down a too-long day, you can wind up a new day just bursting with possibilities."}
{"text":"I had liver & onions with hash browns and a tossed salad.  Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty low key. It wasn't busy until after we sat down. Breakfast all day. This place is like Perkins, IHOP, and Denny's. Lots of choices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   The service was good but it seemed like they were understaffed once it got busy.   They also have TVs and we were able to catch the Badgers football game at the time.   We will probably come back."}
{"text":"After getting food poisoning from a Thai food place in the SF Bay Area and not eating for the whole day, and with four hours of sleep, the thinly shaved corned beef sandwich hit the spot. Nice small town feel joint, not too commercialized... Though I think everyone was weirded out by a couple of Asian dudes coming in for dinner. My buddy had the Monte Cristo, and they deserve at least 4 stars for just having that on the menu."}
{"text":"Grilled Cod with a gorgeous salad. I can eat out and still eat lo carb and healthy. This is delicious! So flavorful and beautiful. I love this place. I've been a customer for many many years. Whatever my latest food  plan... they always have something for me to enjoy. My kid loves the pancakes. My fiancée loves the hash browns and fish fry. My dog loves the plentiful leftovers. The portions are big. The prices are low.  5.  stars"}
{"text":"I think I must have ordered the wrong thing because my experience was more of a 2.5 stars than the raves from so many other reviews. I stopped in for a late weekday lunch and went with a turkey club. I am aware this is a family restaurant, but maybe the hype had my expectations out of line. Wonder bread, sliced turkey loaf, iceberg lettuce, tomato, and bacon. The bacon was great, I'll give them that. The turkey, not so much. I wasn't expecting carved turkey, but when you thick-slice processed turkey the processed part becomes very apparent. No thanks. I ended up picking it off the second half of my sandwich and having a BLT instead. Fries were fresh and hot, and they were among the best battered fries I've had. I don't really care for battered fries, though, and wish that was noted on the menu. My boyfriend ordered country-fried steak and his meal looked a better than mine. Maybe breakfast is what I should stick to here?   Another thing that was off-putting was my water. It tasted like a combination of dish detergent and grease. I tried my boyfriend's as well and his tasted the same. I'm sure I could have asked for a new water, but if both of our glasses were soapy I figured the rest of the load was, too.   Lastly was the price. For a no-frills family restaurant I didn't feel $25 with tip was worth it. I'd be willing to come back to try something different, but if I felt the same after visit two I think I'd be done."}
{"text":"Best breakfast we've had in Madison. The Mediterranean Eggs Benedict were flavorful and full of veggies, the chicken skillet had a whole chicken breast worth of meat and was well seasoned. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and awesome time!!! Very homey and down to earth! Awesome food serving size and follow up with great people!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It has a great salad bar and some comfort food. The first time I ate here, I was having a hard day and was inappropriately cracking up about navy bean soup when the waiter told me the soup of the day. He was very patient with me and understood that this was probably a mental break down. Ever since, I have been back about 10 times."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hercules Special.  It was a lot of food and all quite good. My wife had the Eggs Benedict and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great Hollandaise sauce. We got Free OJ with our meals, which was a great perk. The place is very quaint, food came out quickly.  The inside decor needs some work, but it a nice little place if you can look past that."}
{"text":"This place was not bad. I went for breakfast and found the price to be right. The portions are awesome and they came around with refills so frequently, I couldn't tell how many cups I had. The breakfast meals we got were under $11. Top sirloin, eggs, hash browns and pancakes - $10.99. Country fried steak, eggs, hash brown and pancakes - $8.99.   I actually really enjoyed their pancakes most. They were super fluffy and moist. I'll probably come back and try their other options."}
{"text":"Amazing service with food for a family restaurant.  You get a ton of food for what you pay for, a great deal.  I've been there a bunch and have enjoyed everything I've had off their diverse menu.  Highly recommend for good affordable food with great service."}
{"text":"Your typical family diner with huge portions and extremely friendly staff. Good location. Must stop if you are looking for a diner in Madison.   French fries were nice and crispy. Perfect to pair with ranch. Sausage, pepper, onion, and mushroom skillet and chicken fried chicken were gigantic, but still good quality food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty typical across the board. Typical food, typical straight-forward service.  Lots of coffee refills for me, no water refills for my SO. The menu was huge and the food was reasonably priced.  There was some confusion on whether we were to just sit down or wait to be seated. Overall, everything was \"okay.\" Average.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"I have yet to receive bad food or bad service here. Everything is always exactly as I order it, and it's beautiful.  So, yeah, it's diner fare. Some people aren't in to that and they're welcome to their wrong opinion.   Things of note:   You get an obscene amount of mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. No, really, you get at least 10 and they're the awesome breaded fat one.   The portions of their food in general is huge. You will not leave hungry.   Their prices are awesome. Those mozzarella sticks?  $8.99   Their severs are always super nice and very attentive, even when they're packed.   Breakfast is great and their burgers are amazing.   They do an all you can eat fish fry on Fridays, and you can either get Perch or Cod.   The too long didn't read version of this is you should eat here. It's a nice family owned place, and I can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"The Food Was Okay, But Nothing I Would Try A For A Second Time. That's Just My Opionion"}
{"text":"We love Parkway. We go here almost every weekend for breakfast. Good pancakes, great waffles made with malted batter, large omelets, gyro meat with eggs for those of us who love gyro meat. Excellent and attentive wait staff, prompt service, food served hot, restaurant always clean - what's not to love? Far cheaper than other breakfast places in town, and we always leave happy and full. No, it's not high-end, gourmet, or romantic - it's a diner, and one of the best I've been to."}
{"text":"Awesome greasy spoon. Hidden gem for breakfast in Madison! Skip the chain restaurants and hit this place up...."}
{"text":"I love Parkway! I've been eating here for years now and I've never once had a bad experience. The food is average diner quality done right and served in giant portions. The menu is large and suits all tastes. Best breakfasts ever!! Fantastic value and always delicious."}
