{"text":"Newly remodeled and very classy inside! Food is upscale bar food and very good. Large menu with breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Staff was very courteous and friendly. Highly recommended if you're in Old Toronto!"}
{"text":"In a neighborhood that is currently cluttered with numerous curry, shawarma and Subway sandwich options, it's nice to see the addition of The Sky Stars restaurant.   Now, this is in the old Mounties location, but this is a new owner and it has been 100% renovated inside.    I feel like the community may not fully realize that this is no longer a cheap watering hole for local riff raff. Yes, there still may be the bars on the window, but I hope that they will come down in time to make it look more appealing, but for now you just have to look past that and see what they have done inside and what is now being offered.  I had the Triple Bacon Burger with fries and coleslaw and it was delicious, filling and reasonably priced. I would get this meal again for sure, but I'm excited to try some of the many other terrific items that can be found on the large menu.  I'm really looking forward to trying some of the all-day breakfast options as well, especially since the diner I frequented across the street shut down just before Christmas.  I'd love to see this business stick around and thrive. Please welcome them to the community by checking them out! Dine in, take out or place an order via Skip the Dishes! This is not a franchise restaurant, it's the only one, so I'm sure they would appreciate the support!  Oh and they also have some nice big screen TV's showing various sports and/or music videos if you are looking for a place to watch a game with pitchers of beer and wings. Keep an eye out for specials!"}
