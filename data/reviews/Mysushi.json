{"text":"Very fresh. They can also do traditional roles. We enjoyed our meal and the soup was good miso soup. Limited fish options, but have plenty of options for rolls."}
{"text":"Interesting and new way to order sushi. It's basically a smart way to make Sushi appeal to the fast-food crowd. Restaurant is clean, service is fast. The food is better than an all-you-can eat restaurant, and leagues better than the crap they sell at supermarkets. Recommend this if you like Sushi and have limited time, AND want something a little different."}
{"text":"I've been here two or three times and think this concept is fantastic. I love being able to totally customize my sushi rolls AND they have great quality ingredients. The staff are super friendly and when I'm stuck they will provide good suggestions for additions to my rolls. My only problem with this place is that I wished I lived closer to it so I could come every week! I think for the quality and the fact I can totally make the rolls my own I think the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Low end of the all you can eat sushi chain.  Bad service.  Gave my toddler a giant cup of water which she immediately spilled all over herself.  Gave me sushi with no ginger or wasabi, took 10 mins to get her attention to ask for some.  Quality is sub par."}
{"text":"This place is cooooool.
I love sushi and I am the pickiest child on this planet.
It's such a simple concept- make your own sushi!
It's fast and they have a nice variety of stuff to put in there and it all tastes great!
It's not a waiter-service sit-down place, kind of fast-food esque but better.
Also the staff were so friendly and funny and patient with me asking for their opinions about how my weird combination of fillings was going to taste."}
{"text":"Saw a place with a similar concept a while back while watching Shark Tank.

Essentially this place is Subway but with sushi. 

The selection is amazing and some of their signature rolls are fantastic. But the real inherent value to check this place out is that you can literally have it your way (at BK). They also offer some of the best sweet potato fries that I've had in a long time (Its easy to screw it up)

There are two down sides that stopped me from giving this place 5 stars. One was the waiting time. I showed up with 2 other people and the waiting time to get everything said and done was too long. I would be concerned if there were more people in front or behind us in that scenario, thank god when I went there was no one there at all. The other problem with this place was the price, it was a little on the higher side than I had anticipated, but that being said, I'm getting things made to order, so paying a premium for it is not unheard of.

Otherwise, check this place out. Good food, good decor, definitely going back there in the future."}
{"text":"Mysushi is Harvey's of sush if it's good or bad depends on how much you like Harvey's I guess. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore the idea of having a customized sushi experience, my problem with it is that it is fast-food sushi, meaning a quick snack on the go, made out of cheapest ingredients and served on a plastic tray. Some might like it very much but I am the type that better thrives on long savory meals than on drive-through approach to food. One thing, it is definitely unique and should be tried at least once in your life. Checked off my list now."}

Mysushi maybe the place for you if you have craving for maki/rolls!

Step One: Rice and Wrap

Step Five: Toppings

Crispy Onions/7 Chili Spice/Tempura Bits/Sesame Seeds/ or Nothing at all

Step Six: Salad or Soup

Step Seven: Eat in or Take out

Step Eight: Admire your personal creation...

My creation for tonight is Sweet and Healthy Tuna ($8.99) - 
Nori/White Rice/Tuna Tataki/Asparagus/Carrot/Inari/Mysushi Sauce/Sesame Seeds with Salad Eat in 

I found it a little too sweet but with interesting texture. The other items were just too overpowering in taste and I can barely taste the tuna.. maybe I can just go for whole veggie roll ($5.99) instead?!

If you are not really creative, Mysushi does have some fixed combination that you can order off their menu without thinking too hard what you feel like eating...

The concept is kind of fun and it is nice to have the rolls prepared fresh right before your eyes than have them sitting in the cooler like at some fast food sushi place. 

The interior is nicely decorated and great to meet up with your health conscious/vegan/vegetarian friends for a quick bite! 

BTW, there are over 700,000 different variable combination accordingly to Mysushi.. you can even make your sushi without any rice if you on a no carb diet!"}
