{"text":"Absolutely some of the best buffalo wings I have ever had. Earlier reviews mentioned cigarette smell, it was actually very clean and no cigarette smell at all. Must have cleaned up. Regular wing crowd  including out of towners coming back for more. Definitely worth the trip for those who love wings."}
{"text":"I've heard for years how good the wings were here... and so we finally stopped at my husbands suggestion.  With a near empty restaurant, we were guided to a table at the dark top level.. .no thanks. I asked to be seated at the lower level by a window. Table was small small small. Chair was small small small. We got a pitcher of beer as $3.50 for a draft of Bud was a bit much. Wings are sold in quantities of 5, 10 or 16. What happened to dozen or 1/2 dozen. Prices were, again, a bit high... 5 for $5.79!!  Best part was the curly fries... very good. Wings were small and very disappointing. I asked for Cajun Rub, but my wings came to me wet. I was not happy. My waiter said that because I asked for hot, he assumed I wanted the wet rub as the dry rub has no heat level.  Ah, he may have known that, but I didn't know that's how they did it there. That's his job, not mine to explain while ordering. We ate off of small paper plates with cheap plastic forks and used napkins that shred with the first touch.  What a gold mine to be close to Robert Morris U with students who may not be used to better. WAY too expensive. We'll keep going to our dive bar - Rooster's Roadhouse. We like, no make that LOVE our dive bars, but appreciate getting our money's worth! Adding 'Dud' to the end of their name....."}
{"text":"Best wings around.. I recommend trying the cajun hot.. definitely a little pricey, but they are good.. cooked crispy and no lack of sauce."}
{"text":"They used to have truly awesome wings...best around. Anymore you are gambling if there is any meat on them. Sauces are still very good though"}
{"text":"I read good reviews and was disappointed.  I figured I would try is when I visited from out of town.  Waited 45 minutes for 16 over cooked wings. Server couldn't really care less."}
{"text":"WSS has excellent food and a fun place to be from top to bottom.  Despite their name, the menu offers a variety and it is great food across the board.  The Garlic Parm. wings are my favorite, but you can get them at varying heat intensity levels (Mild/Medium/Hot...), they realize that everyone has different \"heat\" thresholds...And if you like extra sauce, you can get them extra wet.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating even on the busiest of days.  We recently visited the restaurant and Laura was our waitress.  She went above and beyond to make sure our large party of 10 was completely satisfied.  Recognizing that it was a busy night and the food may take slightly longer than usual, she offered our young son crackers and crayons to keep him entertained.  This may seem like an expected offer from a waitress, but the place was packed and she had several other customers to take care of.  We didn't have to ask, she just wanted to do what she felt would bring a smile to our table.  She was so attentive to us and even held napkins over a dripping cup so it would not drip on anyone as she delivered it across the table.  The entire staff is very friendly and considerate, but given the circumstances of how busy the night was, Laura went above and beyond to make sure everyone was satisfied and she did it with a smile.  Great place, great staff, great food!"}
{"text":"No. Better. Wings. Anywhere  cajun 1st. Bbq next.  I have been going here for 20 yrs & have not found a better wing yet.  Plump, cooked perfectly.  And the fries?  Yum!!  Must go here.  Must!!"}
{"text":"The food is not great and extremely overpriced. The Wendy's across the street probably could have made a better chicken sandwich for about $3."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite wings place anywhere! We happily travel from the city to Moon Twp for their hot buffalo wings. I like my wings well done, but not dried out. These are perfect every time. The fries and breaded mushrooms are also very good. Pricey (I would suggest wing specials on certain days), but excellent wings."}
{"text":"Best wings around. They are fried longer then most places so they are crispier on the outside, so that might be a turnoff to some. The place is a dive, but the people there are friendly."}
{"text":"Meh. Good beer selection for a small bar, 10 beers on tap. My server was very nice and attentive (that's where the 2 stars comes from). I ordered boneless wings and they were inedible. There was something about them... They were a weird chewy, rubber consistency. It grossed me out and that takes a lot to do. I cashed out and left asap. I'm in from out of town and should've known from the empty resturant. Maybe the bone in wings are better?! Probably a good place to drink... To be fair I only had 1 thing off the menu... Blah."}
{"text":"Let me start with the good: the beer is great, all the draft beers are craft which are a good selection and variety for whatever you might be looking for. The wait staff is also very good. 

The food leaves quite a bit to be desired. Don't expect Buffalo wild wings or wings and rings quality. The boneless wings are 1\" by 1\" cubes of lightly fried chicken, so 5 in the small order is not a lot of food by any means. The fries are good but lots of small pieces and you're best off getting a full order to receive a decent basket of them. You'll most likely need to fill up on fries to get a decent meal, as the chicken is limited."}
{"text":"WAY overpriced for the quality of food and atmosphere.  The service was good, but I see no need to return."}
{"text":"Definitely the best wings place in the world!  I have been to wings places in a town of different places and nothing compares to it!"}
{"text":"Wings were awesome and crispy. Dry rub was great. Some of our folks thought they were too cooked but they were just right for me. Sides of pickles fries and jalape√±os were great.  I will say the service was phenomenal. Very dumpy place which I love."}
{"text":"Love me some wings suds and spuds. I will go out of my way to grab lunch or dinner here. Great wings and great curly fries!"}
{"text":"Every time we are near the Pittsburgh Airport, we try and make a point to stop by and have some wings and libations.  The wings are good, I like the something-dust, sorry, I never remember until I see the menu.  When ordering the fries, unless you're a HUGE fry fan, just order one and share with one or two especially if you're eating it with other food like wings.  We are big fans of the wings and fries.  it's a small place with a tiny parking lot but worth the trouble."}
{"text":"A decent place - can't knock it, but would look for another option given a choice.

We just wanted a place to chill for a bit and grab a quick bite before our daughter caught her flight. It's close to the airport. My wife was a bit concerned about the exterior appearance of the restaurant - thought it was a bit divey, and the interior was a bit dark. 

The food was OK - we had the pepper jack cheese balls, some boneless wings and the dry rub fried chicken sandwich. Again, everything was OK, although the wings were swimming in the bottom of a sauce pond which leaked through the wax paper food lining of the basket.

The service was prompt and attentive enough.

We had the above plus two sodas and a Sam Adams for $34. You'll get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Garbage small over priced wings. I would expect nice big wings from a place that markets themselves as a wing place. Honestly I would of rather eat the grilled cheese we ordered for our son. We ordered take out as we were staying at the motel next door and had our children with us. They sell beer to go which is nice but at 10.60 a six pack. We will be skipping this place next time we are in the area......NO GOOD"}
{"text":"curb appeal...ehhh prob not. but it looks like a local spot to go so i fig'd what the heck its right across from my hotel, i have time to kill, and need to get buzz on before my family gets here. inside decor is typical of a cozy bar/restaurant. 

food...better have 2 or 3 ppl to eat the fries! gee whiz theres a pile! fries n chicken sandwich came out fast. chicken breast was thick n juicy. mayo packets worked out great.

price...ehhhh what the heck im on vaca! it was decently priced for quality bar food.

service...bartender was nice and the waiters seemed to be on their game too. even tho it wasnt packed with patrons, the workers stayed busy and professional. (no horseplay or group chat sessions in the common areas)

i'll def be stopping by here again for some beers  and grub before the wknd is over."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best wings. Never had a bad experience, and I've been going there since I was little. Great service all the time."}
{"text":"Worst experience! We ordered (table of 8) and another table ordered after us (table of 12). Of course, they got their food first. It took almost 40 mins for us to get our food. I ordered a taco salad with no onions. It was fulll of onions. I tried to pick around them because we didn't have time to reorder. Well, no success! Mind you, I advised the waitress (both of them). She asked if I wanted anything else. I told her no because we didn't have enough time to wait. They both showed no tact...I asked about not paying for the meal because of this issue. She told me there wasn't a manager on duty. Next, she called a girl name Hannah to handle the situation very rudely as if it didn't matter. So, I told Hannah the issue and respectfully said, I don't think I should have to pay for this. She was like whatever, threw her hands in the air and walked off. They were very rude and slow as hell. My group was visiting the area from Robins Air Force base. I will definitely let others know not to eat there unless you have 3 hrs to spare."}
{"text":"A little pricey for paper plates. Also, website has a picture of whole wings but you get individual pieces in an order."}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh. Curly fries are also amazing. A little pricy but you get what you pay for here--quality."}
{"text":"The best place for wings in Pittsburgh. I would rate this as no. 1! The waitress was attentive, fun loving and provided service with a smile. When we have visitors at work I make it a point to bring them here. A place to be proud of!"}
{"text":"Lena and I ate at this true hole-in-the-wall while on an overnight in Pittsburgh. The drinks were very cheap, and the food was honestly quite good. Apparently they are known for their wings, and they didn't disappoint! We had a split order of 10 wings that were cooked nice and crispy but not over-done. The hot sauce was my favorite, the honey mustard was also decent. The hand cut curly fries were some of the best I've had, came piping hot and delicious. We also shared a chili dog with cheese. It was a great assortment of food, the service was attentive, and all around a much better dining experience than I would have thought before walking into the place. Thanks to yelp for some good reviews. I would certainly recommend it for some decent bar bites and cheap drinks!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently came here for a late dinner. We were shopping all day and wanted something relatively quick. We both appreciate a place that has good wings. She is from New York and had never been to Wings Suds and Spuds. I grew up in the Pittsburgh area and have been there several times over the years. I recommended there because of my past experiences but I was embarrassed about mentioning the place after we left. They were just about the worst wings that I have ever had. The wings were soggy and had zero flavor. We also ordered the curly fries which pretty much came out raw. I know of many people that have said this place is hit or miss. You may go in and get some of the best wings out there or you may get the experience we had. I highly doubt we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Oh boy where to start.
First, when we arrived (party of 2),the hostess informed us that because they were so slow we could sit anywhere. This leads me to assume the servers weren't working on sections that day. Which is why it was confusing when halfway through our meal, in a more or less empty dining room, an immediately rowdy and loud family with 4 young children was sat directly next to us. Why on earth would you seat a family full of tiny, screaming children right next to us when there's an array of empty tables further away??

Secondly, they refuse to sell sides of sauce???? I mean I asked for a side of the extra hot sauce with all intent of paying for the extra sauce. They won't give you sauce sides, but they will give you a side of seasoning. What does that even mean???

Third, our server was miserable.

The wings were fine"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after coming home from vacation. After a long flight, we were starving and this was one of the closest places to where we parked our car. From the outside, it doesn't look like much. And it isn't much on the inside either.  However, I don't care about appearance as long as the food is good. I ordered hot bbq wings with fries, he ordered a chicken parm sandwich. It just so happened that the kitchen made too many deep fried pickles for someone else's order and so we got a complimentary order of those too. I thought the food portions were large, especially the fries. The wings were ok, not my favorite. The chicken parm sandwich left a lot to be desired. Although, a place called \"Wings, Suds and Spuds,\" you probably shouldn't order a chicken parm sandwich. As for the deep fried pickles, they were pretty ordinary. The food is typical bar food but I imagine this would be a great place   to watch sports games."}
{"text":"I'd definitely have some of these wings again. They were cooked well and the flavors were good. I wish there was a standard for \"hot\" though. This place was on the mild-side. You might want to go with extra hot if you lean that direction. The staff were able to seat and manage our large group of 20 without an extensive wait time. They have some decent appetizers. I think I'm partial to the chips. 

It's kind of a dive, but in a good way. As others have said, the parking situation is pretty bad. I think I took the absolute last spot and people after us started making them up. 

Overall... wing craving satisfied."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look great from outside, but boy!  Go inside and enjoy some of the best wings you've ever tried!

I loved the crisp of the Cajun spiced wings and a very generous portion of handmade curly fries."}
{"text":"Friendly, personable staff. The wings are fantastic and the beer on tap selection is huge!!! If you're staying by the airport, check this place out! Beats the hell out of the Primanti Bros across the street."}
{"text":"I flew into the Pittsburgh Airport and had time to kill before having to pick up my mom that was flying in almost 4 hours after me. BOOO!
I checked the 5 reviews and thought \"what the heck, I have nothing else to do.\" 

The parking lot was packed for a Thursday at 7pm, the food must be good! 

GOOD PART: I sat down at the bar and the barkeeper quickly gave me a mug of their finest seasonal.
BAD PART: I watched her clean the bar for 10 minutes before she actually took my food order. 

It looked like a tiny mom and pop dirty little wing spot, I was excited! I order 10 wings: 5 Honey Barbecue & 5 Garlic Parmesan. They have more than 10 flavors and you can order any of them as mild, medium, hot, or extra hot.
GOOD: ranch was awesome
BAD: worse wings I've ever had. Thank God for the ranch dressing because without it I wouldn't have had anything to mask the god awful sauce they claim as BBQ and Garlic Parmesan. It was soupy sauce and it didn't even closely resemble a BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"First time here! GREAT boneless wings. Had Jerk and Cajun. Good beer selection too. Nothin' fancy but will definitely be back! Alcohol a bit pricey...surprised by a $43 bill for 2 people. All we had were boneless wings and 3 drinks."}
{"text":"Overall excellent Buffalo and wet Cajun Cajun wings! (Others are also good I'm sure but those are what I always get) Also I think the atmosphere is fine, don't know why people are crying about it on here (It's a local wing joint not a five-star restaurant haha) but only reason they don't get a five out of five is because their prices are a little high for wings.


However what is good to know about this wing place is they always come out good... Not sometimes overcooked or sometimes undercooked or sometimes not enough sauce... Here it's always the same which is good for wing place... Consistency"}
{"text":"Just OK... beer cold but boneless wings pathetic and definitely not hot nor tasty. Cool Dive though....."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  Would have probably been ok except when you sit at the two seats by the wall, the bartender is always using the soda gun, getting ice, etc and right in your face.  It gets old quick.  And the a/c is right above your head.

Bar area is very odd.  The side across from us has this old cooler with I think 8 taps - 4 towers with 2 handles each.  Handles are on the inside & outside of the bar.  Very awkward for the bartender.  The one working this day put the glass around to the other side to fill it.  Or you would have to walk around.

Ordered wings and a half of porterhouse sandwich & their potato chips.  Ordered the wings crispy.  I guess they were, but they come so drenched in their sauce.  I bet both flavors had a cup of sauce on them.  Obviously way too much. Steak was ok.  Slightly better than a steak um.  Chips were very good."}
{"text":"First time being at this hole in the wall restaurant. Let me tell you the ambience is cool and the dive atmosphere is exciting. However, when it came to the wings let me tell you they were not that bad, nor that good. These wings are EXPENSIVE to the contrary it is a dive bar and you would expect a little bit less expensive. For 16 wings you are looking at a 17 dollar check and in my opinion that is completely ludicrous. And don't bother with the \"extra hot,\" it cost more money and you can't even tell the difference from hot to extra hot. All in all not a bad experience but because or the prices, I will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"Since I was about seven years old, these have been my favorite wings on the planet. To its credit and to a fault, this place hasn't changed much since the late '80s. It still smells like cigarettes, vinegar, and Tabasco sauce... and they still have neon-colored shirts and all the trimmings of 1989 culture.

The wings haven't changed either... with nearly 10 flavors (Honey BBQ being my favorite) that are the best, everrr. The french fries, which come in overfilled baskets, are also an essential. 

This isn't health food... but when the Steelers are playing on a cold day, there's nothing finer."}
{"text":"The wings here are delicious but the rest of the place is a litte too dated. They're great or takeout or a party, but eating in it's dim, crowded, old, and kind of uncomfortable. The bathrooms are tiny and ancient, and honestly the prices are kind of high. Again, delicious food but a lot of other \"negatives\" that keep us from going here often when we're in Moon. Last time I was there, they didn't even take credit cards....there's an ATM where you can get cash to pay. Come on...."}
{"text":"Key word here \" Dive Bar\" if you are from Pittsburgh and don't have a favorite dive bar then  your not from the burgh!  If you are a oyster bar, dirty \"o\", mike and Tony's, Triangle bar, Mineos pizza  and frankies bar type person. If you don't know what i am talking about, go somewhere else, so there is more room for us.  If you do know what i am talking about. This place is for you. HANDS DOWN. The best Pittsburgh wings. The next best is the original Quaker steak and lube with the old fryers in Sharon."}
{"text":"Kind of have to lower my review. Past couple times we were here the service was horrible"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings I have ever had.  Been coming here for over 20 years.  If you like wings this is your place.  Love the paper plates!  Been keeping it real for decades!! If you like a fancy place, this isn't the place for you but if you want a great meal a must try."}
{"text":"The wings here have been a favorite of mine for years. French fries must be eaten hot while waiting, with a little vinegar and salt. The mood is loud and fun, and the teriyaki hot wings are the best.
I like them extra crispy, which gives me time to have a beer too. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Still on the decline.  Over done wings and how to they manage cold fries. Used t be so good but not anymore"}
{"text":"Wings.... Expensive for the taste , good seasoning, and sauces.. Although they were way over cooked.. So crispy that the meat was gone.. So GREASY it made me and the wife sick... A great portion  of curly fries and the nacho cheese was by far the best... 
I Gave the two stars because of the service..the waitress was outstanding and always kept the beer coming.. 
Now only if they can get their timing down and change the grease once and a while they shall be a great place.."}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh!!!! But come on I can't get a miller lite draft ?? No domestic light beer on tap. Forget the fact that it's a wing joint or that domestic light beer makes up 80% of the draft market. Thank god they didn't drink the kool aid when it came to their wing recipes. Love the wings but get real nobody wants a draft  of snotty nose booger IPA while killing some hot wings."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, the Nachos were dumped into a basket weren't even warm, dumped a bunch of cat food and cheese wiz on top. The beer was good, nice selection and reasonably priced. I would rather go to Primati's"}
{"text":"Really great food BUT I can't stand all of the paper products used. It's a sit down restaurant, not a fast food joint. Tiny paper plates, paper cups, and plastic forks makes it seem cheap. Three of us ate wings and apps. If our bill is $64, you should invest in a dishwasher. ......Not to mention the environmental factor."}
{"text":"2nd time I was here from several years ago. I took an out of town person who is a big wing fan. He liked the wings, I enjoyed the boneless wings however the prices were excessive"}
{"text":"Best Wings in the Pittsburgh Pennsylvania region! I would give this place more than 5 star's if I was alowed to. I can guarantee that you will not be sorry if you go here."}
{"text":"Fairly expensive for wings, and are suprisingly filling wings. On Mondays they have their *wing night* for $15 you can have all the wings you care to eat, but as I said before they are very filling wings. The french fries in my opinion were fair at best.

Highs: Good sauce, Good waiters, A lot of sauce, A lot of french fries come with the order.
Lows: Smokey, Not very cheap, Very small building"}
{"text":"I loved this place since I went to school in Pittsburgh!
My classmates and I would go here on the weekends and pig out! Mainly because the food is SOOO cheap, yet SOOOO good.. WS&S basically allowed me to \"Ball on a Budget\"

I graduated college in 09'
I just so happened to be heading back to Pittsburgh for my classmates wedding. (Yes.. to the same girl he was with when I lived out there, 
BTW Congrats again guys if you're reading this... Yes I totally came here the day of your wedding, before your wedding.. && I'm so sorry\"

Wings Suds & Spuds needed to be a destination for me while out in the area.. And I'm so glad I came! I ordered my usual Garlic Parm wings.. and its still the same! God I love this place! 

Don't let the Exterior fool you... It is a bit Divey. But holy crap are they the best wing place.

I can't wait until I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"The wings are good, and the drinks were good. I used to come here often but I haven't been here in about one year.  The prices are high for wing size, but the sauce is so good.  We had the Cajun and honey garlic."}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times, easily. The food is very good, some items seem pricey but worth it. Never had anything here that wasn't fantastic. Nice selection of craft beers also. Even with 12-15 choices they rotate often and there's always 3 or 4 good beers worth trying."}
{"text":"You know the place is good when you are fighting for a parking spot.    I needed a place to detox and watch some sports with like minded peoplle.

After 5 minutes of waiting for people to leave, i was able to park (Yes parking is that tight).    I walked in the back door and this little mom and pop restaurant had a 10 min wait for a table.   

I found a spot on the bar and ordered my customary beer.   Looking to my left and right I see all the patrons aggressively working on their wings.   

The service was great.    I ordered a small order of wings (8) which were much larger than the BW3 variety.    Each of the flavors can be ordeerd hot (spicy).

The place was tight and not many tvs but the food, patrons, and service were all pluses to the experience.

Cost:

Wings - $8 (they were big - atleast I thought)
Beers - $3

I will go again.   I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"This used to be better, but is a solid 4 star place that I can routinely go after years and years, and still get too much wings, ok fries, and beer.  a dive bar that I like, and would go back to.  I'm a fan, as they say.  ask for 'em wet if you like 'em wet.

good for groups, but not too big because they are not that big.  also, entrance at rear."}
{"text":"Ordered buffalo style (mild) amd when it came, the wings were drenched in I don't know what."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying Drovers in Wellsburg, WV has and always will be my favorite place for wings. To be honest I didn't think any place would ever even come close. That is until we finally stopped into Wings, Suds & Spuds. Their wings are delicious. I honestly don't think I've ever left this place with leftovers. My wife won't eat wings anywhere. She tried some here and now she is always asking if we can go back. My fav flavor is the HOT/BBQ and my Wife loves the MED/RANCH. Her and my Daughter also love the deep fired chips with ranch.

The parking is pretty compact but we've never had any issues but we usually like to roll up on the Weekday and usually around Happy Hour. If you are in the area and can avoid the temptation of eating across the street @ Primanti Bros then do yourself a favor and check this place out. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good wings however very over priced for food and drinks. Would go back again for the wings, but going elsewhere to drink."}
{"text":"Without question the best wings in the Pittsburgh area.  My wife and I make the 45 minute trip to this place a few times a year and are always happy.

The wings are cooked perfectly, not too crunchy or too slimy.  Their sauce choice can be overwhelming, but if you ask for recommendations they will provide you with some food options.

I have many favorites, but our usual go to sauces are the wet cajun, hot ranch, hot bbq, and regular buffalo.  Make sure to get their homemade ranch with the wings as well."}
{"text":"Don't be turned away by the facade of this hole in wall wing joint.  Once you get inside, it actually is a lot nicer.  It seems that every restaurant in town serve up their \"famous\" wings sprinkled with their magical wing seasoning.  But very few places that I have gone to, actually did something different which made their wings stand out from the pack. 

Wings Suds & Spuds does truly have a unique recipe for creating their wings.  They have a laundry list of available flavors, but all come with their unique buffalo sauce.  So whatever flavor you decide on, be ready for the follow up question: \"Mild, Medium, Hot\"  I thought this was great.  Most wing places make you sacrifice spice if you order garlic Parmesan.  Not this place.  I went for Garlic Parmesan and Honey BBQ: both Hot.  Lets do this.

Me and a coworker place our orders and were soon delighted with baskets of hot, fresh, dripping wings.  Unlike many other places, these wings basically come to you in a pool of sauce.  Enough sauce you better roll your sleeves up because it is going to be messy.  With a tower of napkins to my left and bones basket to my right, I went straight in.  I was amazingly surprised that these wings packed a spicy punch, not enough to turn my stomach inside out, but enough that it blended well with the flavor that i had selected.

All in all, I enjoyed the wings thoroughly and would definitely come back to try out some of the other flavors.  And I am went to have wings, suds, and spuds all in the same sitting, I might need to come back in the evening to try that."}
{"text":"Horrible. Btw the Pop is 2.29. For not even a can size amount in a paper cup. Overpriced and over cooked."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall joint.  I only come here maybe 3 or 4 times a year but I really like it.  I only like my wings extra crispy or burnt,  and this place has always delivered for me.  Staff has always been good and provided great service.  My only complaint is the celery isn't so good and there prices are much to high for here.  You will pay a little more but I don't have a problem with that as long as they keep up what they got going on."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better. Their wings are okay but nothing special. Nice if you don't want to go to a chain but it's nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get wings since high school and, let me say, it is still worth the half-hour trip to Moon. They have everything you could want in a chicken wing: great flavors (my personal favorites being the ranch, Cajun hot, and honey barbecue), quality substance (i.e. no dinky wings), and an absolute perfect crispy texture every time. If you're extra hungry, you can get (and split) a generous order of curly fries with cheese. In addition to the great food and beer, the service is also always great. The place is small and unassuming, but that's what we love about it! A trip to Suds is a trip down Memory Lane. A very delicious trip."}
{"text":"You just don't get any better than that for wings... Nice and crispy with an original sauce not quite like anywhere else. Try the Cajun!"}
{"text":"The bad:  The parking is absolutely terrible.  The bathrooms are dirty.  The place is a dive bar, not a restaurant.

The Mediocre:  The wings.  I read reviews here that said the wings were AH-MAZE-ING.  They weren't.  They also weren't terrible, but they didn't blow me away.  Combine it with the building, and I probably won't be eating in again.  I would, however order take out.  I just don't think I'd go out of my way.

The Good:  The service.  Very friendly and attentive.  Also very helpful in choosing a good meal.  I was impressed.  Also, the french fries are worth getting.  Very good and generous portions.

I'll eat here again, but it didn't capture my heart like it seems to have for a lot of people here."}
{"text":"Great super greasy food!  Some of the best wings i've had in my life.  Its all served up quite fast and not too expensive.

The restaurant itself  is old, cramped and ugly.  The staff has such a quick turnaround that its never more than just average.  The location on University Blvd. (formerly Beers School Rd.) is awkward.   However with all those, the food and feel of the place is still unmatched.  This is the best Wing joint even in the heart of Quaker Steak and Lube country.  

Also try the fries.  The portions are gigantic."}
{"text":"Great job, dive atmosphere, not overly expensive.  Expected the sandwich to be slightly larger but still delicious.  No complaints at all."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I have been to wings suds and spuds.  Only because I do not live in the area any more. I found myself in the moon area with a hanker'in for good wings I couldn't wait to phone in an order.  WOW! Was I disappointed.  The wings were small WAY over cooked and WAY over priced. Needless to say I won't be back"}
{"text":"It's amusing to read some of the other reviews that people hate on this place.  What did you expect?  What kind of grand, over the top, posh...hip...up and coming restaurant were you looking for?  Because let's be honest, as you can read from the other reviews and SEE FOR YOURSELF FROM THE OUTSIDE...it's a hole in the wall.  This bar has been there FOREVER!  It has probably never had a remodel, a makeover, or a change in ownership.  It still has a sign on the back of the restaurant from the name of the old street, yes...it's been there so long the name of the road has actually changed.  And guess what?  Do you know why it's been there for so long?  Because of one reason, they know how to make a god damn chicken wing, fry up a batch of french fries, and serve a cold glass of beer.  Hense the title of the place.  You'll get perfectly done wings that are DELICIOUS.  You will get a pile of fries that are AMAZING!  You will get beer that is INTOXICATING.  You want pulled pork sandwiches, chicken parm hoagies, steak, burritos, ribs, pasta, ...etc....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  But if you want a hole in the wall dive that is comfortable, reasonably calm, and serves a fierce wing and fry combo....this is your establishment"}
{"text":"The wings were just ok. The staff was too busy talking about their personal life's to check on us. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Best hot wings in the burgh! I've been eating there since 1996 and ignore all the nay sayers, it's just as good as it has ever been. If your aren't getting wings and fries then your ordering the wrong thing. Period. Other menu items are good but any valid review will at least contain those two items. The family that owns the joint has been through a lot. I give them tremendous credit for offering the same quality crispy wings that they have always offered, along with fries that just can't be beat.
And stop complaint about the price, wings are at least $1 a piece anywhere, even the crappy ones that most joints serve. For slightly more money, you are truly getting a world-class wing."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for years and just tried this place recently, my friend had been there before and loved it & I've heard nothing but good reviews. The food was ok but I don't see myself returning.

Two of us came in around 6:30 and it was moderately busy. I ordered the beer battered shrimp and water, my friend ordered wings and a soda and we ordered an order of curly fries. 

We were delivered the fries and my shrimp and our waitress asked if we needed anything else, we asked for ranch which was delivered quickly with no mention of the wings. We both ate the fries and I was waiting to start on my shrimp until his wings arrived. About 10 minutes pass and our server takes the empty fries basket and refills his soda with still no mention of the wings. He commented to me that maybe she forgot to put the order in..I offered him some of my shrimp and we finished them. Probably 20 minutes after the fries & shrimp were delivered, his wings appeared with no comment from our waitress about \"sorry these took so long\" or anything along those lines. I've been to many restaurants before where something isn't quite ready and the server always tells you, \"this will be out in a few minutes,\" it was so strange to me that she didn't mention it at all. So that soured the experience a bit.

The food was good. The curly fries were the perfect temperature and texture. My shrimp had a great beer batter and they didn't have tails, which is annoying with most fried shrimp. They have some of the best ranch I've ever tasted.

Other than the weird timing of the food and our server seeming like she could care less about it I feel like it was a little pricey for what you get. Our bill was almost $30 and I was still hungry...Quaker Steak & Lube is cheaper and I'm always full when I leave there. It was also odd that the shrimp didn't automatically come with some sort of side like fries or coleslaw.

A bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"5 stars ... Period! 
Have to give a shout out to my favorite wing joint of all time. Nothing has changed from the early 90s including the fabulous wings, curly fries, and dated decor.  Just the way it should be... No corporate franchise or expansion to ruin a good thing!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm good with this place. Wings -good, Yuengling on tap- good, curly fries w/whatever you want for dipping - good. Friendly staff at the bar and a great deal for the price. Wings and Penguins hockey. Perfectly PITTSBURGH."}
{"text":"Today, I ordered from here for my daughter because she wanted BBQ wings for after school. I haven't been here for 20 years so I really wanted to find a good wing place. The stench when you walk through the door should of sent me running, but against my better judgment went in anyway. So I ordered the honey BBQ and the garlic parm wings. 20 some dollars later with a 5 dollar tip, I left for home. When my daughter opened them the plastic  container they put them in was open and the sauce was every where . OMG some plastic wrap would of fixed that ,but you have to care about your product.  So we looked in and noooo they were both buffalo wings . So I call to tell them they got our order wrong. A sorry would of been enough for me but no they seriously tell me that no, they remember the order and that it was put out right. And after a few minutes of  back and forth I bring them back to show them that yes you gave me the wrong order. So I go back and they take them back in the kitchen. I could see in the kitchen  and the chef was laughing at the fact that I would bring them back I guess. Then the girl comes out and tells me that  the order was correct  and because they cannot  tell which one was which they would remake the BBQ wings. What you can't tell but we should be able to? The other girl asked me if I wanted a refund  and the first girl says no no refund. By the way, I didn't ask for one. I told them I wasn't  looking for free food and they could keep it. They had poor customer  service and where was the manager, hiding in the back???? If every wing you sell tastes like every wing you sell, count me out. There are way better places to get wings like across the street . You messed up. You could of done the right thing and gained a loyal customer. But you chose to  go the other way. Shame on you one star is one to many"}
{"text":"Ordered from here 3 times and the wings were perfect each time. They were crispy and tasty. I love wings and will only eat them if they are cooked just right. These were great BUT I do think they're a bit overpriced - paid $12.61 for 10 wings."}
{"text":"Grew up in this area and was back in town for a visit. Stopped to eat there and was totally disappointed.

The food stayed the same and the service and prices changed. 

15 wings/side curly fries (no sauces)/fried pickles/salad and 2 sodas -with minimal tip - $47!!

The wings were the best thing of the meal - the sodas were served in 12 oz Dixie cups loaded with ice! It was like 3 gulps and empty! 

The fries and fried pickles were so greasy! Bit into pickle and breading slid right off while grease poured out. Plus 6 pickle 1/4 - so like 1.5 pickle for  $7-8 (I think) So not worth it. 

Chicken salad - I think I paid  $9 for a head of lettuce and 5 small and I mean small pieces of chicken. I had better salads from a gas station pre-made.

The service - horrible! Food came out at different times - we asked for the fries and pickles to come together - pickles came out, 5 min later fries, within mins the salad and 5 min later the wings! 

First soda my BF order - the syrup was out! Ok that happens - took 5 mins to get another and the small glass to begin with was only 1/2 full! 

Totally disappointed! This place has moved to the bottom of our go to list!"}
{"text":"Really good wings! I had the garlic parm and honey BBQ. Service was fast and friendly. The reason for only three stars? This was my first time there and parking was nuts!! Also, the name of the place - I saw \"spuds\" and was expecting like steak fries or some different take on fries or more fry options in the menu... nope! Just basic (not so great) fries with cheese dip that you get out of a can :/

Plus, the prices are pretty steep for what you are getting. All in all - good."}
{"text":"Best wings in PGH.  

It's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Best wings and curly fries in Pittsburgh! I go here at least twice a month and it never disappoints. Staff is always friendly and welcoming- food comes out quickly too! They do a great job here."}
{"text":"I enjoy Wings, Suds & Spuds. My husband does not like it as much as me because of the atmosphere. 

1. It is old and a bit dirty. Spic N Span would do wonders.
2. It is LOUD. Perhaps when you're cleaning you could put some sound walls up so there's not so much echoing?
3. So many children. Like under 18 kids with their parents after baseball/soccer/hockey/random sport. Go away, kids. And parents. :)
4. The staff - I love them. My husband thinks they come around too much. But I'm a talker and he would prefer to stay home so there's that. 
5. The drinks? Spot on and strong. 
6. The draft options? Yay to ciders! 
7. The apps? Greasy-spoon-tastic. 
8. The wings? They are good but not that much money worth of good. Hence the 1 star deduction. 
9. The other like \"meal stuff\"? I dunno...I go for greasy apps and booze. 

Try it out. Don't bring the kids or you'll see me roll my eyes. I'm here to drink!"}
{"text":"Many good memories here through out the years. I flew in late and my only regret is that they are closing before the end of game one of the World Series! This places has great wings and some good beer choices. The high light of Moon!"}
{"text":"Wings Suds and Spuds delivers on very good wings. 

It amazes me how so few places can make a descent chicken wing, but they are few and far between. Wings, Suds and Spuds does a very good job, much better than most. Located in a bit of a rundown area in a hole in the wall facility I found some of the best wings in quite a while. There are lots of flavors to choose from, I chose Buffalo style, spicy. The wings arrived in short order, a bit over sauced. I was expecting a soggy skin, I was wrong. Nice and crispy skin, with wings being medium sized. Very tasty with a container on blue cheese. Two tiny pieces of celery were included. I also had a side of fries, which were good, but not very crispy. It was a very good lunch.

My only complaints: a bit over priced, over sauced wings, fries not crispy, too little celery. On the plus side: wings were very good and crispy, fries despite not being crispy were quite good. Service was good. I would have no problem returning."}
{"text":"By far my favorite wings!  Crispy and wet!  If you like wings, you owe it to yourself to try these.  My favorite is the garlic wings with fries and a Yuengling."}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh. Have been coming here since I was 7, and have never had a bad experience. Wet Cajun and Honey garlic wings are the best! You have to get their curly fries with cheese, if you don't you're really missing out"}
{"text":"Bruh, I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.

This place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small, old, and needs remodeled,  but the wings are still great!

They get crispy right.  And, the service was nice too.

The Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.

Also, get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many, but man they are good.

In short, take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service."}
{"text":"Was here for business and I needed food near the hotel I was staying at. I ordered boneless honey BBQ wings and fries. When I went to pick up my order the price was almost $16!!! I only received 8 wings and the flavor wasn't great. No complaints on the fries, those tasted great. Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Simply the best wings in the Pittsburgh area! 
Crunchy skin over tender chicken. Brought my son for the first time and he said that they were the best wings he's ever eaten. Some places take forever to get an order of wings out. Not here. Wings are served up quick.
Sandwiches on the other hand are pretty average. The half hoagie is more like a quarter. If you're hungry I would suggest getting the whole as the half isn't going to do it. Better yet, skip the sandwiches and order more wings."}
{"text":"Wings, Suds, and Spuds takes me back to my younger years as a newhire with USAir. Some of the best days of my life. Yes, the food is good and the beer is cold. But just as good are the memories of some of the best times of my life."}
{"text":"A little too expensive for what you get.  Especially when the curly fries are cold and the wings are over cooked.  Favors of wings are good but would be better if wings were not over cooked. I realize that taste is a matter of opinion but cold is cold and over cooked and dry is over cooked and dry!!"}
{"text":"We ate here last week and we were pleasantly surprised. They wings are crunchy and you can get any flavor in mild, medium or hot. Also get the basket of fries. I also had the fried green beans they were great but the portion was a little small."}
{"text":"Have been a customer for years, best wings in the burgh, no doubt. But the last time I ate there,  I found some oddly curly hairs on my steak hoagie. Definitely not from someone's head. Health dept complaint was filed."}
{"text":"OK, I read all the other reviews that called this place divey but I assumed they were exaggerating.  They are not.  There are miles of Formica and wobbly chairs everywhere.  The place is small.  How small is it you say, so small that two people can barely squeeze into the foyer.  So small that if you have a party of four waiting for a table to be ready no one else can even enter the place, so small that only one person can stand on either side of the register counter at a time, I'm talking small.

By comparison the parking lot is, well that's small too.  When I went the parking lot was full except for two spots but the restaurant was only 80% full.  This included some folks who parked long the fence line making entry and exit a little difficult.

Onto the food.  The chili was hearty and extra thick.  No significant heat but a cup of this stuff would have made a hearty lunch with some crackers.  I had the Cajun rubbed wings.  These are really cooked wings that are then doused in a cajun rub.  So much so that the container has excess rub (a good tablespoon or so) floating around in it.  Some other places re-fry the wings once they are dredged in the dry rubs to give more adhesion and a more consistent taste.  These were OK but they were more dry than I prefer for an optimal wing.  I suspect that this has to do with the cook time along with the addition of the dry powder that wicked away any surface moisture that was there. 

They also have their own kettle ships.  These were tasty but lacked salt.  When they told me they were not seasoned I assumed, no special seasonings and not sans sodium.  They were tasty enough but some salt would have made them completely addicting.  They give you a small sack that's big enough to share with one or two people.  There were some underdone chips but not so many that it was annoying (Best kettle chips so far IMHO Cincinnatian Hotel In Cincinnati).  

If I am back this way again, i will make another stop in and try one of the wet sauces.  That could take them from 3-4 stars easy if the wing is not as dry."}
{"text":"Ok food if you like things fried but it's very overpriced for a grease pit.  My 4 year old and I had chicken tenders, a half order of fries, a turkey sandwich, and a domestic bottle beer (miller lite).  Total bill was $28 and that's without the tip.  The lack of a kids menu really hurts the review of this place.  I love supporting ma and pop businesses but draw then line when you price gouge."}
{"text":"Another place I have been coming to since I was old enough to drink. The food and beer prices have always been decent. Great selection and tasty tidbits. After shopping in Robinson it's a good stop to unwind."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was in elementary school.  I drove from the north hills to get wings and fries tonight.  I had takeout and paid $30 with a 20%tip.  I took the food home and was unpleasantly surprised.   Our wings (hot garlic and mild garlic) were horribly bland.  The curly fries (usually my favorite) were burnt to a crisp.  Make sure you inspect your food before taking it home!!!  There's no way this was acceptable for the price I paid!!!   Now we have to make dinner tonight...."}
{"text":"Wings were good but very greasy. The \"rib eye\" steak sandwich wasn't a real steak it was wafer steak. It was rather pricey 5 wings small wafer steak sandwich(barely enough meat to be a snack)and a draft beer $17 without tip. (lettuce tomato and onion were extra!?) (it was served without cheese which is extra also). I won't be eating there again anytime soon."}
