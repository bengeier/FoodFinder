{"text":"Nice place.  Very Ohio.?!  Nice view of the river, nice... not great atmosphere.  Nice wine list and menu.  The pan roasted mussel with chorizo sausage and plum tomatoes, butter, basil, garlic and chardonnay rocked.  It's an appetizer that eats like a meal.  Ask for lots of bread to mop up the broth.  I would recommend Lefever."}
{"text":"Very classy, nice place.  Understated decor, with high backed booths so that you have a very private dining experience.  Some tables are available up by the windows (great view while it is still light out).  Has a good selection of wines and some creative martinis too.  Menu is not extensive but has a nice variety.  This fall menu had sea bass, salmon, ribeye, tenderloin, walleye, chicken and more.  Meals come with a basket of some awesome crunchy crusted bread (ciabatta maybe?), and a mixed green salad or soup.  You can upgrade the salad to one of the others offered for a $3 fee.  I had the New England Clam Chowder - absolutely one of the highlights of the  meal.  This soup was not your typical thick, paste like soup with giant chunks of potato - it was a delicate soup with large chunks of clams (what a surprise!) and other veggie goodies.  Would go back for this soup alone!  Meal itself comes with a veggie side.  Nice dessert menu and specialty coffees.

I thought the service was timely and did a great job.  They had some good suggestions for dinner and dessert when we needed help.  A little on the pricey side for this area (tenderloin entree $32 for example), but I've been told that if you sit in the bar that menu is a little more reasonably priced."}
