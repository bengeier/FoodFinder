{"text":"Found a cockroach in the Bok Choy. All the owner said was \"sorry\" and there won't be a charge for that one dish!"}
{"text":"Great place for dumplings & curry chicken. They fill & make the dumplings after you order them. You can have them either pan fried or steamed. Great little place with wonderful dumplings!"}
{"text":"Really great dumplings and flavor! I ordered the boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage, fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings, and garlic eggplant. The fried shrimp and vegetable dumpling was perfect and delicious. The boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage were a little bit salty but didn't bother me too much. The garlic eggplant was one of the best I had. The prices are reasonable and they were really nice to accommodate delivering outside of their zone for me! Would definitely be ordering again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant - wonderful home-style authentic Chinese cooking, awesome pan fried dumplings, amazing value and a great addition to the hood"}
{"text":"Had to re-cook the under cooked dumplings.

Ordered Chinese broccoli dish and got a plate of mushrooms and was told that's how it comes at Chinese food places.

Not worth the $50 dollars, not worth $10 dollars. Want a great dumpling house, try the one on Spadina, the same one these people are trying to duplicate but have failed so miserably at."}
{"text":"Their steamed dumplings are really good. Fresh, and the dough is really chewy but light. Depending on what filling you order, the saltiness can vary. I found the pork quite salty, the seafood or shrimp ones are pretty light in seasoning. For just $6.95 to $7.95, you can get 15 steamed dumplings 12 fried dumplings. I like their combination options for $7.95; you can pick three kind of dumplings (fillings). They have a big selection of non-dumpling options if you aren't in the mood for dumplings. 

Service was super nice. All smiles.

But if you are looking for nice decor and ambiance, this is not the place. Water is served in plastic diner cups and sauce containers are a bit sticky. It's that kind of place, know what I mean?"}
{"text":"Found this little gem because it is close to work.  The steamed dumplings are great and the noodle dishes I have tried (Shanghai and Canton) have been tasty.
The best though are the green onion pancakes, which are hard to find, but I will keep going back for these alone."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for tasty dumplings. Hot and sour soup is great as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It is so great to have good Chinese in the neighborhood. The dumplings are the \"must-order\" items, made fresh and really tasty. 

We also had a vegetable dish and noodles which were good as well, but the dumplings were the highlight."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to this area. Cute little chinese ladies working in there making fresh handmade dumplings at the window and a very wide variety of chinese food. 

They give you a lot too and the taste is great! The price is fair for this location. We got 15 pieces of  dumplings for $6.95 and Chicken Fried rice for $8.95.

 I hope the neighbourhood learns about them and keeps them in business. Its one of the only more authentic asian places on this area of St.Clair. They also open till 11pm every night!

Also they deliver for only $1 if you buy $25 worth of food up to 10:30pm at night, we eat late so this is perfect for us!"}
{"text":"I had the lamb dumplings and the green onion pancake. Food was delicious. Waitress was super friendly. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So out with the old in with the new.

First of all, very refreshing service compared to not only spicy and sweet, but other dumpling places in the city. They are super friendly, attentive and courteous. I think they offered to refill my water 5 times. Awesome!

My gf and I went in for a casual dinner while waiting for laundry. We ordered a large wonton soup and an order of mixed dumplings, not fried. 

First the soup came out very quickly, it was delicious. The wontons were supple and flavourful. The broth was tasty and not overpowering. Exactly what you want and expect. 

The dumplings mix is a great option because we got to try 3 kinds, five of each. We had spinach and mushroom which we're OK, shrimp and veg which left something to be desired, and shrimp pork and chive which were amazing. 

We'd order the shrimp pork and chive again for sure. 

I'd like to try some of their traditional Chinese food offerings next time. And there will be a next time for certain.  

All in all very good bang for buck. A nice addition to the neighbourhood which was lacking on dumplings but not quite as perfected as something at spadina and dundas perhaps."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last night.  Our order consisted of:

- General Tao
- Szechuan Beef
- Singapore Vermicelli 
- Fried Wontons
- House Special Fried Rice

Overall, good flavours, great portions and a very friendly staff. Not the best I've had, but certainly good. A welcome addition to the neighbourhood, which sorely lacks any kind of formidable Chinese food."}
{"text":"Seriously good Chinese takeout. Very fresh tasting. Not overly salted like some takeout places. Large portions. This is my new go to place for those times when only Chinese takeout will do."}
{"text":"Great addition to the mid-town st.clair area!  My husband and I would either settle for Canadian-style asian food, or would make the trek to chinatown for some authentic asian food. Family restaurant recently opened in the last 6 months offers great northern style cuisine, dumplings, northern noodles (not canton style though).  Dumplings were very fresh and home made.  Service is like any other asian - fast food take out place, but you're there for the food, quality and price right?  We've frequented this place a few times already and enjoy the food so far."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to our neighbourhood, an old style family restaurant (mother & son team) with new to Toronto style northern cuisine.  Two of us tried a combo order of the steamed and of the fried dumplings, sampling the different pork varieties, the lamb and the mixed vegetables.  With 15 dumplings in each combo, we left happy and thoroughly stuffed for $18 plus a generous tip.  Not only was the service fast and pleasant but the server was patient and informative in answering our questions about the menu items.  Each item was cooked to perfection, rich in flavour and juices without that leathery texture inside and out that you sometimes get with overcooked items in the larger food factory settings in the big Chinese places uptown and downtown.  This is top notch food for any neighbourhood but particularly for ours which has been Chinese-food-challenged for way too long."}
{"text":"This is could be the reliable Chinese takeout joint that St. Clair West has been lacking. I had the spinach and pork & chive dumplings (they are super crispy with an extra shell of crispiness). The spicy eggplant could be more garlic-y and less oily and vinegary. The General Tao chicken is a standard Westernized dish that is pretty good considering I never order it because it's so inauthentic by definition. The price is a tad high but if you stick to one or two dishes, that'll be enough for a single meal on the fly."}
{"text":"A restaurant that's consistently been terrible to deal with: messed up orders, inability to comprehend us on the phone, greasy flavourless food. I gave it two stars because it's convenient."}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  The menu was diverse with the meal being delicious and the portions, large(American size as my wife put it).  The only negative would be the non-descript decor and simple seating, making it more of a hole in the wall, than a night out restaurant.   

At first, I was surprised that our main meal arrived before the dumpling, traditionally an appetizer.  However, when I realized each dumpling was made to order, the dumpling sampler I ordered and was impressed and well worth the wait.  

The staff was courteous and attentive.  We were certainly be returning and bringing home leftovers for next day's lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious. Never had fried dumplings like this before. Definitely worth it! 

Setting is not so great, but the food is real good, so I'll still give this one a good rating."}
{"text":"I am on vacation in Georgia and I craved some Chinese and went out to be utterly disappointed.  On the plus side it really made me thankful and homesick for Chinese Dumplings which is located down the street from where I live in Toronto.  I realized that I hadn't written a review for Chinese Dumplings even though I've eaten in at least twice and ordered take out countless times.  

My favorite dish here is Szechuan Beef.  Always crispy, spicy, fresh and always delish!  Seriously can't go wrong with it.  Their take out portions are just as amazing as dining in and I'm never disappointed.  Another dish we tend to get is the Shrimp fried rice - it's done just right!  The hot & sour soup is okay, I wish they would improve on it and fancy it up with some little shrimps and I felt that the green peas were a little weird in it. One time we got the cold kelp dish which is offered on a sign when you dine in and loved it.  It was only a couple dollars for a big plate of it and it went well as a side with the hot & sour soup to start.  

Really happy with this place - it's authentic Chinese and super good!"}
{"text":"Disgusting !!! Don't eat here !!! Nasty food
Extremely bad service . Got take out , was expecting good food based on reviews . Very disappointed . Spent 50 bucks on garbage. Had to come back to return it and blamed us. We have had a lot of Chinese food before and this was gross. Don't waste your time or money.  

Wish I didn't have to put any stars but wouldn't let me put 0
This place gets a zero"}
{"text":"Finally a decent Chinese delivery spot in St. Clair W.!  Salty & savoury dishes; generous portions.  The General Tao Chicken (#75) actually tastes like chicken (!) and the sauce is thankfully NOT loaded with msg and corn starch like most.  Dry fried green beans (#68) were very tasty as was the spicy garlic eggplant (#63). Spring rolls (#34) were disappointing as the wrappers were too thin and they were only filled with cabbage.  Special owner Nis fried rice (#125) was decent but may try noodles or a different rice next time. Crispy duck (#46) was tasty but a bit dry; bonus points for the paper thin pancakes. 

TIP: if ordering the Crispy Duck (#46) order an extra package of pancakes as 1 package is definitely not enough for the amount of duck  you get.

Overall very pleased with the balance between greasy-salty-savoury yet not too greasy or gloopy as many Chinese delivery places tend to be. Asked for extra-spicy and they sent a container of delicious garlic-chili oil. Negative: they only sent 2 pks of plum sauce for 4 spring rolls, no soy sauce and no hot sauce. Guess you have to ask for it specifically? After trying many Chinese delivery places since moving to the neighbourhood a year ago, this is the first place I would definitely order from again and continue exploring their menu items. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"Located near between the Sea Witch and El Rincon on the south side of St Clair.

My first visit was a take out order of Shrimp and pork dumplings, house special rice and mixed vegetables with beef. Different from your typical Chinese food and really nice folks running the place. This cold winter has been hard on the local restaurants so I am going to step up my eating on this new spot."}
{"text":"Mediocre. The Spring Rolls were very, very oily and the Chicken Fried Rice was bland and also overly oily. The Sweet & Sour Pork tasted like food court Chinese. The Ginger Beef with Onion was slimy and had massive inedible chunks of ginger root in it. Overall, disappointing"}
{"text":"The good: reasonable prices and good portions, friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating staff. Still thinking about the crispy beef and pan fried dumplings. 

The so so: it's greasy (which to some is a plus and some a minus... So I'm treating it as a neutral point).

The bad: minimal parking"}
{"text":"Good steamed dumplings and pan fried ones too. 

The General Tso's chicken was good too (medium sized chunks and not over-fried).

Besides the dumplings it's pretty much your standard fast food american-chinese items with MSG and grease. 

Update: I've been a few more times and the fried stuff is a bit too greasy and the weird after taste does not go away.  Try to avoid ordering too much of that.

Update #2: Probably best to just get dumplings here and be wary of other items."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Delivery time was good, food came nice and hot.  Prices seemed a bit higher than elsewhere but the huge portions made up for it. Dinner for 2? You will have plenty leftovers! We started with the pork/shrimp and chive dumplings, Judging from their name and look of the dumplings, they definitely seem made in house and they are quite tasty (tip - if you love spice ask for the chilli sauce). The general tao chicken was excellent, not overdone in batter or sauce, so you actually know its chicken you're eating.  The special owner ni rice was good but needed salt for someone who likes salt. This was remedied by using a bit of soy sauce. The crispy duck came shredded and with the thin wraps and chives, while tasty the duck was a bit dry. Eggplant was great and not overloaded with sauce and msg. Overall - glad this restaurant is in the neighborhood would definitely order from again."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in Toronto.  It's not fancy, but it's good.  The spicy fried Chicken (?????) is awesome."}
{"text":"MSG CITY.... We were super excited about this place and were very disappointed when they told us that they use MSG in virtually all of their dishes. The one thing that didn't have it was their green onion pancake which they get shipped in frozen. It was really gross when I tried it. My partner ended up feeling sick the next day.  Go to mother dumplings on spadina. Their stuff is fresh and they don't use any msg in anything.... And their food tastes way better."}
{"text":"I was craving dumplings so I ended up here, without knowing anything except for the name, \"Chinese Dumplings\" (10 points for originality here, haha).

And boy was I surprised! This place is great! I got the combo dumplings (spinach & mushrooms, chicken and pork & cabbage) plus the wonton soup (did I mention I was craving dumplings?) and I think I spent something under 15$.

The dumplings are amazing and the soup is huge (i got the \"small\" one, I am afraid of what's \"large\" for Chinese Dumplings honestly...) so all in all a definite thumbs up for this place.

A nice thing is that you can see the dumplings being made at the front, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Excellent dumpling take-out spot. You can eat like a king for $15. This appears to be a family-run business and the grandmother figure can often be seen hand-rolling dumplings in the window. Freshly made and scrumptious. Friendly staff.

The downside: closed on Tuesdays (random and confusing day to be closed)."}
{"text":"We order here regularly and love it. Highly recommend all the pork dumpling options. The non dumpling options we've tried have also been delicious. They aren't the quickest spot, but are reliably tasty. It's our go to Chinese delivery option - recommend."}
{"text":"Have finally, after many years of ordering thru Just Eat, found the bottom of the barrel for delivered Chinese food in my area. Delivery was late, food was cold due to poor packaginging and handling by driver. Driver orginally delivered wrong order. No need for Ancestry DNA test on the General Tso's Chicken, there was NO chicken involved in this order. Absolute mystery what the\"protein\" was. Dumplings were textbook for the word \":flacid\":. Dull and uninspiring, no dipping sauce involved. You could almost hear the sigh of ennui of the person makling them, The kung Pau chicken was overcooked and looked and tasted like the raw materials for making Christmas candy canes. Really sad stuff. Thirty four dollars down the drain. Never order from this place."}
{"text":"2.5.  We ate here on a Sat afternoon and the place was empty. We were put off at once by a sticky table. The dumplings, however, were good and were prepared in the front window as we waited. The steamed were fine, the fried ok as well. We had green beans too, very tasty but a too-huge portion.
  All in all, the lack of cleanliness spoiled pretty good food."}
{"text":"St Clair area is not where I'd usually go looking for Chinese food but since my husband's friend's son has moved into an apt nearby, I wanted to bring the young man some \"food from home\". This restaurant worked out perfectly!

As soon as I walked up and saw them rolling out the dough for wrappers and forming the tiny morsels of deliciousness, I knew the dumplings would be good. I loved their variety too. Our family favourite is the pork and dill (actually should be lamb and dill). We also ordered some pork and celery dumplings for our friend. 

Chinese Dumplings offers pan-fried potstickers (??) and boiled dumplings (??). Very authentic. Perhaps they have steamed dumplings too."}
{"text":"Terrible food, very batter heavy with chicken wings, dumplings and oily. Their won ton soup was way to salty.
Mixed vegetables where huge chunks and not very tasty with large raw chunks of onions mixed in. Their cost is not cheap as I paid a bit more based on reviews and expected good quality products.  Stay away from this take out  place if at all possible."}
{"text":"A good Asian Food spot in the St. Clair area. We order from here every other week. They have a great menu and love their deep fried spicy squid, but not too crazy about their siu mai \"shumai\". It's a nice place and has many seating, as well as a couple of bar seating inside, and another bar at the front of the store; the storefront glazing \"windows\" opens facing Dupont street, so pretty much no air condition in the place throughout summer."}
{"text":"Um pequeno e simples restaurante, aonde você pode sentar pra comer ou pegar pra levar (que me pareceu o mais comum).
O cardápio é bem variado, dumplings (no vapor ou frito) e noodles são os mais famosos entre muitas outras opções.
Eu pedi um combo aonde você escolhe três opções de dumpling (frito), cordeiro, porco e camarão com legumes.
A massa estava grossa e bem oleosa, gosto de óleo usado também.
O de cordeiro e o de camarão estavam ok, mas nada de especial. Já o de porco estava com um sabor bem estranho.
Não gostei dos dumplings da casa.
Mas em compensação, pedi um noodles de frango (sem legumes), e estava super gostoso, com bastante frango.
O atendimento é rápido, mas não muito gentil. E o preço é ótimo, considero barato perto de outros, mas pela qualidade é um valor razoável."}
{"text":"Great wonton soup! Very tasty dumplings. Gets me my soup fix. Its really nice to have a decent chinese restaurant in this neighbourhood. Fun to watch the ladies make fresh dumplings in the window!
Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great little dumpling spot! We've ordered it on UberEATS many times and it's always fresh. Can't really say much about the entrees on the menu but the dumplings are definitely delicious and I would highly recommend them. Both fried and boiled are great!"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty dumplings hand rolled and made right before your eyes!  The staff is wonderful.  Vegetarian dumpling options are limited, but delicious. The garlic mixed veg is also quite good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The pork and chive Dumplings are fantastic (fried).  We have tried a few other items on the menu and have always been impressed with the simple and delicious options available.

The spicy green beans are also recommended!"}
