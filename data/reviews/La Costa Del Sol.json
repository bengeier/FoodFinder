{"text":"Very authentic pupusas.  Hand made to order  so expect to wait . I had a spinach and cheese one and chicharron  with cheese and beans. Big and thick and very filling.  The rice is good but don't expect Spanish rice. Serving staff helpful and nice."}
{"text":"This place  that fuck  up  the. Food  without salt  and to fucken. Cold   And. The charger  ex for. To go  order  it's was  my favorite place but now they are so bad"}
{"text":"We ordered combo #1, some pupusas revueltas & a shrimp pupusa! Soooo good! Best food ever!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food but initially slow/nervous service.  We walked in stood at the counter for a touch then grabbed real menus and sat at a booth. It took a minute before my brother and I were waited on even then. Though there were only two other tables with guests. We're black they were hispanic, maybe that had something to do with it. But, once the server came and told us she spoke little English and us a little Spanish, service picked up and she began to check on us just as often as the other guests. I Ordered the small breakfast. Which came with fried plantain, a fried egg, sour cream, creamed beans and a tortilla. The beans were very smooth and pureed. They were super flavorful I recommend you get them.  the tortilla was thicker than a traditional tortilla but very tasty as well. My brother had steak tacos. We both enjoyed our food. I'd recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"The place is THE WORST Salvadorean restaurant I've ever been to. A friend & I went on a Saturday night & they have a guy singing karaoke for entertainment. The music & his singing were UNCOMFORTABLY LOUD. We could barely hear each other. I ordered a liquado with banana & it was DISGUSTING. It tasted nothing like it should taste. I gave the waitress the drink back, told her it didn't taste right, & asked for a coke. She came back with a diet coke. She finally brought me a coke can with no glass. I asked for a glass. She brought me a broken one with a chip on the top. When we received our food all the pupusas were piled on my friend's plate & she placed an empty plate in front of me & walked away. The pupusas were mostly filled with bean & barely any meat. We finished our food in a hurry because the karaoke guy's music was so loud we couldn't have a real conversation. They NEVER asked if we were doing okay or if we needed anything. NO REFILLS on our drinks not even my friend's water. We asked for the bill & we noticed they were charging us for the liquado with banana drink that we returned. I told them I didn't drink it because it tasted wrong & the waitress stated that they made it for me & they make it different than all the other restaurants so I needed to pay for it. I refused to pay & she took it off the bill. We paid & promptly left. There are prices are low because the QUALITY IS BAD. If you enjoy HORRIBLE SERVICE, GROSS FOOD, BROKEN DINNERWARE, POOR STAFF ATTITUDE, HEADACHE INDUCING MUSIC, & A TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE then this is the place for you. MINUS FIVE STARS!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy pupusas with the fixings (cabbage and red sauce). Chicken was only okay... overcooked and dry for my taste."}
{"text":"A nice, and small place. They serve your typical Salvadoran dishes. Their pupusas are my go-to item for this location. Definitely the best ones on the Eastside."}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered pupusas and would've given this restaurant a 4. HOWEVER I ordered the Horchata Salvadore√±a and DID NOT like it. I told the waitress I didn't like it and if I could order another drink. She SAID NO. Guess It's not worth it to them to lose $2 and keep a customer paying $15+ 2-3 times a month. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"A must go if you're looking for delicious pupusas and other Salvadoran or Mexican dishes. The bean and cheese pupusas are great plain, no sauce or salsa needed. I always get three carne tacos and 2 bean and cheese pupusas and I am stuffed. I have never been dissatisfied with their food or service."}
{"text":"Just came here last night and ate some popusas. I had the chicharon con queso...freaking bomb!!! I also had queso con loroco not bad but thought they were a bit stingy with the cheese. Overall the food was good staff was ok, environment not bad but just had some loud karaoke so couldn't really have a conversation with my date."}
{"text":"So far the worst Pupusas I have try don't even bother to go !"}
{"text":"High quality pupusas and fresh, thick hand-made tortillas to go with your meal. The carne asada tacos were decently sized with a ton of chopped tomatoes and onions. The steak was dry, but at least had some seasoning. This was a nice, hidden gem and will be back for the pupusas."}
{"text":"best Salvadorean restaurant in the Eastside of Vegas. I am Salvadorean so its pretty hard to find a restaurant that does excellent Salvadorean food that tastes as close as home.. Its a very small place and it gets busy on a Sunday morning but the food is very cheap and delicious. They have Karaoke Saturday and Sunday night so it loud in there and some waitresses are a little rude.."}
{"text":"The best pupusas in town. I don't like pupusas from restaurants bc they don't taste authentic. This place is a jem in Vegas. By far the best pupusas I've had besides my Grandma's. The girls in there don't speak English, but they do check up on you all time. This place makes me forget that I'm actually in Vegas."}
{"text":"everytime i come to vegas, i have to come eat here. pupusas are yummy. love the beans with fried bananas & cream. nice staff."}
{"text":"Pupusas for $1.50...oohh sooo good...but oohh soo greasy.

This resturaunt seems like Grandma's in the kitchen. The pupsas are a Salvidorian kinda thingy...

Hand made thick corn tortilla filled inside w/ cheese beans and pork.

My one and ONLY complaint is that thier cheese is too greasy, after it melts, out pours the oily mess. 

but hey, you'll love it and you'll never know until you try it. 

& YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"Love their Authentic Salvadorian Food. Only bad thing is when you order to go they give you a smaller portion than what they would serve you there."}
{"text":"Love their spinach pupusas. Pupusas not too big or too small. Very authentic! Salsa for pupusas not spicy which is the norm. Salsa for chips a bit spicy and tasty. Clean restaurant and quick service."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this place is because of the service. I don't blame the girls because I'm a server as well and I know how overwhelming it can be when you are short staff. The pupusas are so delicious I love them but get them to go. And what bothers me the most is that the owner is just sitting there in the corner watching everything like hello you want your business to do well help out! Or hire an extra server! I hate to give this place one star but maybe they will fix the issue."}
{"text":"Fiance and family come to this place they been living here for years I found out why a must go to place. Try there horchata!!!"}
{"text":"Best pupusas in the city. Having been to what the restaurant others suggest serves the best pupupas (Las Pupusas) I prefer and totally recommend Costa del Sol. Fresh and made to perfection. Would give 5 stars but their service is lacking quality and efficiency."}
{"text":"Great please to eat, sit, and relax. The main reason I come here was for the pupusas and they do not disappoint.
Just customer service sucks ."}
{"text":"They did do a remodeling of the inside! See? Plus the pupusas are the same. But they are less greasy now. They taste awesome! Karaoke still there."}
{"text":"Awesome pupusas! Tasty and cheese was just oozing out of em. Got the pork and cheese pupusas. Inexpensive and fulfilling. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I had the pupusas and they were very good. I also ate the platanos Fritos and they were soooo yummy. Defenatly recommend this place. Only thing is waitress was rude, but I guess the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I order here because it's right by my house. The food is great..but the customer service seems to get worse every time I go there! Be prepared to wait a long time for your order! This place charges extra for everything! I wanted an extra side of veggies and they wouldn't allow me to purchase it because I needed to spend more than 10 dollars on my card, even though I had just bought 20 dollars worth of food! Not sure if I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"I worst place to come to ! Over price for a bunch and grease lol this is a joke , the girls are rude and take forever ! I wouldn't even want my worst enemy to eat here smh ?"}
{"text":"Went there with my hubby and 2 kids on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside... I was a little nervous.  The inside was pretty clean and tidy... not much for decor but   there was a guy on karoke singing songs in Spanish!  
We went mainly for the pupusas.... they were cheap, a lil' oily and oh so cheesy!  There are 3 types available, plain w/cheese, cheese and bean and a pork cheese and bean.  we ordered a couple of each  and were not disappointed.  Next time I'll ask them to make them \"well done\"  a couple were kinda doughy... the slaw they came with was ok.. nothin special... 

They had a sign for 12 pupusas for $12 Mon-Fri... I dont remember what type but it sounded like a good deal.....  

We'll definately be back!"}
{"text":"I come here about once a week , this place is great ! The popusas are one of a kind , bean cheese are really good just bought some today for lunch , and prices are fair also I recommend the prepared beer here, it's super tasty , they have them like that anywhere else"}
{"text":"Tasty pupusas... nuff said?  Cheap and not too greasy.  
Oh yeah, they have orange soda.  

Ok ok... the restaurant was roomy and clean too.  The girls behind the counter were nice. 

Might see ya there!"}
{"text":"Just spent $15 on 4 pupusas and I was expecting them to be amazing but they each have a pound of grease and hardly have a filling. Definitely not going back! My family usually makes them and well I guess I'm just used to fat non greasy pupusas. Lol nonetheless these weren't great at all."}
{"text":"Yum

This place is very good and very authentic. Initially I was upset they were out of the pork tamales, but the chicken tamal was excellent I also had a few bites of a pork chili relleno and nothing could describe it other than amazing. I have returned a few times and it is always good!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had previously been here three other times 1st time amazing (busy , waited aproximately 10-15 min but great food completely different people and cook... 2nd time around 1/2 of the previous waitresses where gone and took a little longer even though their was only one other table with people waiting in the entire restaurant.. from this point forward its all gone down hill. This time around it was just a disaster. Looks like all new management and waitresses. I asked our waitress and she said most girls left and that she was new.
There where aproximately 5 tables in the entire restaurant including us with people, so not too slow or supper buissy either.
1st thing bad (we where served Really Hard Chips)
2nd they brought my husband an orchata that tasted burnt.
3rd When placing my order I explained to our waitress that i wanted my egg whites cooked but my yolk still runny/ blanditos/ tiernitos (spanish :) ) I literally said it those three ways for her to understand what I wanted and she gave me the look like she didn't really understand but just nodded. At that point I noticed that she wasn't writing anything down. Being a previous waitress one thing I learned is that you write everything down and if you don't understand something you ask. But i figured she might have photographic memory and will remember everything. 
My husband ordered two sides of cheese....

To top it all off, we had to wait aproximately 45min after all that only to get the following 

2 sides of cream instead of chesse....then when i asked is this for us? she said my husband ordered it...when stepping away i asked my husband he said no and when she returned with my order she said oh im sorry it was cheese you wanted right?? Then placing my plate with one semi burnt egg and one egg that had been leaked and over cooked... even a child could have done a better job. I then proceeded to tell her excuse me ! .... (still trying to be polite ) these eggs are a little too cooked for my liking. She then said ...thats how runny eggs are.. I then told her really, then with my finger i poked both eggs and said nothing is comming out from them so you are telling me these are runny? She then said oh i guess one popped and I said Im sorry im not going to eat that... she said well ill see what i can do.
If you are a new waitresses and some one is telling you something is not right you do not argue especially if they are correct.
Food was not good and services was worse.
From now on we will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food tasted good. The first time I came here with a friend, it was great. They set chips and salsa on our table without us asking, didn't charge for it, and the wait for our actual food was short. Today when my mother's friend and I came here, the wait was extremely long even though there were only two other tables with people in it. We had to ask for salsa and chips, this time we were charged for it, and the service overall was just not good. I expected a small restaurant that usually only has two tables occupied to be more humble."}
{"text":"Since it is near my house and I love pupusas, I tried this place and my friend yelp! this place for their delicious food. The food was amazing! Was big, very tasteful and very friendly customers service!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The customer service sucks bad if you call and tell them were missing food they will fight you and say they have you everything. Like why would i lie about it well anyways the ower should really look up and fix his customer service. Thank you"}
{"text":"I love the Costa del Sol. Recommended if you never been their to eat go try it. I love my Salvadoran Peep's."}
{"text":"horrible service..Ruined my family breakfast, I decided to give them another chance months later but I ordered to go because I didn't want to deal with the attitude, Only to get home and see the wrong order!! $18 for a wrong breakfast.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here have been for the past 8 years the owners are down to earth and all the girls are great they all know me by name. Always friendly. The good is great and the flavors are spot on. I have never had a bad experience from this restaurant"}
{"text":"It was the worst customer service ever. The ladys were so rude. Kept asking what we wanted with attitude and then when answered they would never bring what we asked for. Must be hard to get another Jamaica. Took them almost half an hour to get our food. But took them less than 30 seconds to hand over our check lmao this place is a joke. If I could I'd give them 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"La agua de Jamaica large, super! Un poco azucarada pero reditiendo se el hielo, esta bien. 
Las pupusas, deliciosas, y el ambiente esta muy bien tambien, estilo karaoke."}
{"text":"The owner/manager that runs this place gives the worst customer service and acts like she doesn't want your business. I went there to buy pupusas at 9:30 pm. The restaurant closes at 10p. When I ordered my food, I initially ordered 3 pupusas and side of chips to go. I had a friend with me and she wanted to try one, so I told the waitress if one of the pupusas could be served for here because my friend and I wanted to split it. (When she 1st wrote down my order she didn't hesitate to point out that they are about to close and that I have to hurry up with my order- as if It was inconvenient for coming in at that time to spend money in their business). So when I asked her to make one of the pupusas for here, she said we are not serving any food for here, the open sign is now off and we close at 10 and we still have to mop and we leave at 10pm. There was a lady that butted in and started reiterating the same thing the waitress was telling me and I asked for the manager, she replied \"yo soy la manager\". I looked at here and was stunned that a manager would treat customers like that. I said this is the 2nd time I come in here and both times I have been made to feel rushed and almost as if I am being kicked out. She said \"we are not kicking you out\". Anyway, after arguing back and forth for about 2 minutes with this lady, I sat down. I was talking to my friend and I made the decision to ask for a refund and leave. I asked her for my money back and the manager said \"we can't give you your money back\" and I said \"yes you can and you need to give it to me now. \" I don't want to eat here, I will never be coming back. She told me \"you can go ahead and ask the bank for your money back\" and I said \"no, you're going to give my back and that's it.\" Finally she told one of the waitresses, \"daselo\". Before she told the waitress to give it to me, I asked her that I wanted to speak to the owner and she replied \"Yo soy la due√±a\". I was even more shocked that this person would treat customers in this manner and make them feel so un welcomed. They gave me my money and I left. I will never be going back to this restaurant. They don't want my business because they want to clock out right 10p, them I'll take my business elsewhere. If you want to leave at 10p on the dot, then close at 9p. You can't start closing an hour before closing and expect customers to know you don't like sit down orders 30 minutes before the restaurant actually closes. I've seen restaurants that allow ppl to finish their meal, even after closing. Plus it was only one damn pupusa that I was gonna share with my friend. We could've definitely eaten that in the 30 minutes left before they closed. I wouldn't even give it one star, but I can't post the reviewing out putting one and I have never taken the time to write reviews for any restaurant I have ever been in, but this was enough for me to actually spend 10 minutes out my time to let everyone know this place has the worst customer service. 
Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Good pupusas ,but costumer service is horrible. The first time I went I brushed it off , but when I decided to return it was even worse. I decided to leave before I even ordered."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was when a friend of mine recommended it to me for their pupusas. That day I was surprised, it was very good. The second time back, months later, it was not good at all. The pupusas were very flat & cheaper out, the flavor wasn't there.

Tasteless slaw & salsa with flat pupusas? 
Boring. 

Going back to looking for a new pupusas spot y'all !"}
