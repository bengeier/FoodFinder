{"text":"Just had the jerk wing dings.... Mouth watering and hot as a furnace, but strangely I can not get enough... I ordered 5 for $4 and I was excited with that... Promise this will knock you right out of your socks... The service is a little slow but perfection sometimes takes time... Never had a bad experience with fireside..."}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally found a suitable Jamaican restaurant worthy enough of my review. I've tried Royal Caribbean in East Liberty and I have to give a C grade. Been that I'm from DC I'm used to A+ Jamaican but Fireside gets a B+. I had the Oxtail with rice and peas and it as a lot of food and very good. Its located in Wilkinsburg on Penn and Center st right across from the Historic Penn-Lincoln hotel  which might be why you can never find it when you search for it on Yelp. Their service was fast and courteous and very respectful. They only take cash which is ok because Pamela's do the same thing. Overall I enjoyed the food. I know Wilkinsburg gets a bad wrap but don't worry about the neighborhood, I've eaten in worse places in DC and most hole in the wall places make the best food. Check it out. I'm a Grad Student at Pitt so my word is golden. Have fun."}
{"text":"Fireside is one of those no frills places where you know you will get a solid Jamaican meal. I am a huge fan of caribbean food, and have had quite my share. This place hits the spot for me. I've had their jerk wings, not the hot wings. They are braised in jerk sauce/gravy, not fried or baked, and the sauce is delicious. They're large in size, not small and scrappy. Personally, I prefer a lot more heat when it comes to jerk spice/flavor, and I don't get that with theirs', but you won't catch me not crushing them for this reason! The oxtail is tender and unctuous, with thick, (not watery!) full bodied gravy. And that beef patty, wow, probably the best I've ever had being that it's made in house and not warmed up from a packet in the freezer (which I don't mind either). The take out box that includes the protein with rice and peas, and veggies on the side, weighs at least 5 pounds, maybe more. I have never been able to down it in one sitting, it's so plentiful. Can definitely feed two, so quite the bang for your buck. They don't have take out menus, so don't ask! I did my first time there, and was given a \"you must be crazy\" look by the lady working the counter. They accept credit cards. Every time I'm in there, I see people of all kinds of backgrounds. So word travels, and they know what's up. I recommend ordering in advance and taking out. Can't wait to try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, and the food was really good. I chose a non-spicy dish of chicken and rice, but there are spicier options available. They also have Jamaican Kola Champagne and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Jamaican food, so my taste buds were watering when someone suggested Fireside as the \"go-to\" spot for Jamaican food in Pittsburgh-WRONG!  It was some of the worst food I have ever tasted.  I didn't mind the hole in the wall atmosphere, because some of the best Jamaican spots I've been to have been small.  However, this spot missed the mark.  I ordered ox-tails, rice and peas, and cabbage (I would have ordered plantains, but they didn't have any).  The rice and peas were mushy, the gravy was salty, and I received more bones than I did actual meat.  The cabbage was really good though.  The gentleman serving the food lacked customer service skills...and quite frankly, if I am going to spend $13 on some food....I could get a smile and a thank you.  The next time I want Jamaican food, I will be going to the Royal Caribbean in East Liberty."}
{"text":"Wow! Great authentic Jamaican food! Overall everything we had was amazing, ox tail stew, curry chicken, curry goat, and stewed chicken

Definitely recommend I've been to four different Caribbean restaurants around Pittsburgh and this is definitely one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"One of my fave places to eat in Pittsburgh the food is Fresh, seasoned well and made with love. So that means they are busy lol  so don't try to call and place an order just come on in, order your food and wait. I ordered some fish it was a 40min wait. I really didn't mind waiting bc I knew it must be great and it was. Have some patience when ordering the wait is worth it. I also love how they have Veggie options for me that really fill me up."}
{"text":"If I could give less than a star I would. This restaurant tried to steal my money. Charged me almost $30 for one pepper steak lunch meal and tried to tell me to come in at a certain date to be refunded but it just so happens that the date would've been AFTER the money would've already been transferred out of my account. Instead of cancelling the transaction and charging me the $10 it would have been.... The amount of money was less important than the OWNER trying to get over on me for a second time. I would've understood if it was a new employee or something that made the mistake, it was an easy fix.... But the owners response was.............. Cool too."}
{"text":"Had curry goat with rice and peas and cabbage. I also tried my friends Brown stewed red snapper it was delicious. My goat was tender and delicious as well. They didn't have plantains but they had Kola champagne which is a delicious soda that taste like sweet cream soda. The service was fair. It was a little busy but handled well."}
{"text":"Wouldn't have considered wandering into Wilkinsburg on my own as it's a bit out of the way for me but when my friend recommended this spot after a good gym session I was totally for it. 

Totally divey yet, local spot but with absolutely delicious, authentic, well spiced food! I had the Jamaican style curry chicken over rice with a side salad. The rice soaked up the curry perfectly. Also, it leaves you fell and satisfied with I think is a better option than the \"hungry for more salivation\" I personally always regret the hour afterwards of incredible discomfort so this is perfect and will not be tainting your opinion for when you come again -- you will come again.

You will have a meal and a half with their portions, so ask for your meal in a to-go box no matter if you are dining in or not."}
{"text":"Well I just moved to Wilkinsburg and I thought I'd get myself something to eat after a long 12 hour day of work and man was I pleased I did. I called in for take-out and ordered the \"Brown Stew Chicken\" which was absolutely delicious; the meat right off the bone and the sauce was rich and delightful. It came with a side of seasoned rice and beans and white cabbage which were all cooked just right. And finally for dessert, the best \"Fried Plantains\" I've ever had. Thick slices of the banana's cousin that were caramelized and slightly charred (in a good way), tender, and just sweet enough. I shall definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Jamaican food
Fast service 
Large portions
Honest straight forward Jamaican service

I recommend this to anyone looking for a genuine Jamaican meal"}
{"text":"Very good food! Must try, Oxtails, rice and cabbage. The chicken patties are delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm just discovering this place. Learned that they've been around for about 10 years. When I arrived in Pgh about four years ago, I had a hard time finding a good Jamaican restaurant, but am happy that Fireside is now part of my repertoire.

I'm Jamaican and can say Fireside delivers a pretty good and delicious fare of Jamaican cuisine. First time I went, I had fish tea (fish soup) and fried dumplings. Fried dumplings are what we (Jamaicans) typically have for breakfast; added with cooked greens called callaloo, ackee or saltfish. It's been ages since I've had this, so was happy to see it on the menu. This last time I had brown stew chicken (a dish I sometimes make at home) and it was the real deal. The food was fresh and hot, and portions were generous. This will be my go-to spot for Jamaican food!"}
{"text":"I give them four stars, not for atmosphere or beautiful chandeliers ,tables and decoration. I give them four stars because they have some delicious Jamaican food. It's like being down in the islands man."}
{"text":"Fireside was all that I read from previous customers - If your looking for authentic food then this is the place! If your looking for a beautiful decor then look elsewhere! It's the food that delivers! Very friendly and fast service - The only complaint is that Fireside doesn't really have competition in order to challenge quality of food."}
{"text":"Had to try this place for comparison after a very pleasing experience at Leon's Caribbean Restaurant.  And for the most part, the food and the prices here live up to the high bar set.

We ordered the Jerk Shrimp, a small Oxtail Stew, and an extra order of cabbage.  I appreciated that choices such as the extra sides were demonstrated on a slightly more detailed menu.  The jerk sauce here was less flavorful and spicy than Leon's, though still very tasty.  The oxtail was highly satisfying, and the rice and beans and cabbage were great.  

Our takeout containers came fully loaded, with our meal coming to about $30 with more than enough food to feed 2.  Service was slow for takeout from the relatively empty restaurant on a Saturday night, but with the seafood made to order, I'm not really one to complain.  With this location not too inconvenient from my North Oakland home, I'm not opposed to returning to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place should get some more attention. The surrounding area isn't the most desirable, but it's definitely a gem in the middle of a desert. The food rivals Impressionz in East Liberty. Service isn't as good here, but they do open later and they have a bunch of Jamaican sodas and drinks.

The brown sauce chicken and oxtail are both delicious. We got smalls, and they come with choice of peas and rice or white rice, plus a side of cabbage salad. For drink, I tried the pineapple guava juice--very sweet and tropical."}
{"text":"Worst ever! Your food is good but not good enough for me to be ignored when I'm trying to give you business. I have an idea how about you get off the phone and actually work. Worst ever!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place ... But the food is so GREAT!!! Mmmmmm try the beef patty too .. They give u so much food for a good price.."}
{"text":"Be careful of the bait and switch!!!! Make sure you check your order!!!! Made a call in order for curry chicken with cabbage, rice and peas. I received chicken and an absurd amount of cabbage. No plantain with my order either. I was quoted one price over the phone then got charged more when I got there! Also ordered a beef patty. It was tasteless and dry!!!  Wasn't worth what I paid. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Their chicken patties are awesome! Since my first visit I've also returned to try the brown stew chicken. It's good. The establishment isn't  the most fanciest place however it's worth the stop at least for a take-out. Friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"This is my go to for Jamaican food in Pittsburgh. The portions are huge and the jerk chicken is my favorite. Also recommend trying some of the Jamaican sodas they have for sale too."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Just grabbed a \"small\" jerk chicken platter for lunch (in quotations because it was more than enough for a lunch portion). My plate included three pieces of well seasoned chicken, a bed of rice with beans and sauce, and cabbage. I got a beef patty and a ginger beer on the side. As an afterthought, I really wish I had added some plantains to my plate for a touch of sweetness. What a satisfying lunch! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking looking for some good Caribbean food!

A few notes - there is seating so you can eat lunch in the restaurant. It's a bit dated, think 70's diner decor, but it's clean and charming! Also, they do accept cards."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food in the burgh. Been around for years and still great quality! I've had oxtail, brown stew chicken, curry chicken. You name it. Plate is always full and taste is great!"}
{"text":"Good stuff good price.  Being my first time in Pittsburgh I was glad to see there was a decent Jamaican restaurant with moderately spicy food. I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of coco bread, but otherwise it was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was actually recommended to us by a Pittsburgh rap star. He said it was really good Jamaican food and he was absolutely right. I'm not really into spicy food so I refrained from getting anything curry. I ordered the chicken stew with rice and beans and salad. The chicken stew was absolutely amazing. It was so good that I actually got sleepy as soon as I finished lol. 


The prices were unbelievably cheap for the amount of food that you get. It's definitely a great way to feed yourself if you're on a budget. The quality of the food here is absolutely amazing. It's a small mom and pop shop but do not be fooled by the look of this place. You're gonna get your money's worth."}
{"text":"When I come here I usually order the same things. 
Fried plantains, pepper steak, steamed veggies, fried chicken dinner or curried chicken. Not all at once of course.
Those to me are triumphant meals when it comes to authentic Jamaican cuisine. I've never been disappointed. The flavors are mouth-watering and succulent.
It's a bare bones basic eatery but trust me when I say it's all about the food.
Short of going directly to Jamaica you'll not find anything more genuine."}
