{"text":"This is definitely the best delivery Chinese food in the area. They seem to put a little more care and thought into each dish compared to a lot of other places. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Dinner box is awesome , you only spend $8.75 but you can try 4 meal in 1 box. So good like that combo"}
{"text":"I was looking for some take out delivery on a Sunday and came across Wai Wai. When I ordered the food, the lady on the phone told me 45 minutes, but it was really 30 minutes, which my growling stomach appreciated. I ordered chicken with broccoli and my roommate ordered chicken lo mein. Both meals were delicious and the servings are enough to feed three people per dish! Yay for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Wai Wai is  probably 4 stars before 9 pm. After that you risk wasting your money if you place an order.

I used to order consistently from Wai Wai and loved their food but stopped  after a bad experience. I placed an order at 10:30 on a Friday night. I asked if they were still taking orders and the receptionist  cheerfully told me yes. I asked for a large shrimp fried rice and to shrimp egg rolls. I got one large chicken fried rice with very bland chicken in it. I suspect it was boiled for time. The shrimp egg rolls barely had any shrimp in it. My boyfriend is a pescatarian (strictly fish and vegetarian eater) so he couldn't eat anything I got. I really wasn't interested in it either, and as the dinner cost 20 dollars after the tip. I felt like I wasted my money. A friend that also ordered there had a similar experience when she ordered at around 9 pm.  Take our advice and don't order anywhere near their closing or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the worst food ever in Chinese history for me. Ordered pepper steak and fried rice (paid an extra dollar for the fried rice). The rice I got was half done yellow rice that tasted worst than chalk! Steak meat was soggy. Who makes peppered steak soggy? 

Also ordered spring rolls, another joke! Tasted quite salty. Saw salt crumbs on the roll over. Who dust spring roll in salt after frying?

I called the restaurant to complain but the sweet phone operator cut the phone off me when I spoke with her. 

Am so hungry today but can't eat the nonsense they cooked up. Will be returning their meal to them after work."}
{"text":"It's sad, but I think this place has really gone done hill over the last year or so.  I have lived in Bloomfield for three years and ordered from Wai Wai regularly during that time.  Recently, the food quality has taken a dip in my opinion.  Worse, the delivery driver can't seem to remember to bring silverware and sauces anymore.

This culminated in two recent bad experiences with Wai Wai.  I stopped by for takeout Friday morning on my way home.  I ordered and waited 35 minutes for my food.  Normally, they take 10 minutes or so.  The place was completely empty, but the kitchen took forever to make my food and the one other person who was also waiting.  I was offered a $2 credit for the wait, which was fine by me.

When I got home, the food was not what I ordered.  I received some sort of soup instead of my crab rangoon.  I called and they gave me a $5 credit as well.  Neither of these credits were refunds, only credits that could be applied to a future order.  That is understandable on the $2 waiting credit.  However, when I don't get food that I already paid for, I should be refunded, not issued a discount on a future order.  I shouldn't have to buy more stuff from you in the future in order to be compensated for food I paid for but never got.

Today was the most frustrating part.  I called to order delivery today and take advantage of my credits.  However, Wai Wai refuses to let me use both credits on one order.  In order to take advantage of the credits I got because they screwed up my order, I have to buy from them two separate times?  That is not okay with me at all.  Despite my protests, the woman on the phone refused to apply both credits to my current order so I am now forced with the choice of losing that $2 forever or giving these people more money.  I guess I will choose losing the $2.

I'm saddened because I used to really enjoy Wai Wai.  The food was good, quick, and inexpensive.  Now it is mediocre, slow, and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Wai wai always delivers more quickly than they anticipate...in fact the estimated time for my delivery today was 7:57 and they arrived as I was creating this review over 20 min earlier than expressed in the confirmation email. I will admit it has something to do with the fact that I am less than a mile away, but nonetheless, great service. Always happy with the quality of the food. Never had an issue with the service or food."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, whether you're eating in our getting takeout or delivery. When eating there the presentation is very nice and the atmosphere is good. This is a great place for a date or family dinner. The best part in my opinion is that the food is at the same quality out better than some of the other local high priced Asian restaurants in the area like Tai Pei or Jimmy Wan's. As an added bonus the place is clean and the staff is friendly and accommodating. This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to find 5 star quality food from a 3 star rating food delivery, when we decided to order from someplace different. The best Asian food tasted in Pittsburgh so far, comparable to that back home :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, both times the resturant was completely empty. The staff made a good effort, but alas they were unprofessional. The food was slightly less than mediocre, but it was prepared and served pretty quick. If you're looking for authentic and delectable Asian cuisine, this is not the place. But, if you're in the area and need a quick, reasonably priced meal with large portions Wai Wai is your gem."}
{"text":"Food is bombbbbb, super nice employees, even right before closing. Very impressed."}
{"text":"It was really good Chinese we have gotten take out form there three times so far. Parking is pretty easy to get. The only reason it doesn't get four stars they are not so good at getting the food into the bag. They forgot my dumplings one time and an eggroll the next time. Good food will go back but ck your bag for everything you order......"}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that I'm very picky when it comes to chinese food. Having said that I think that Wai Wai is a great chinese restaurant mainly because their ingredients are always fresh. I hate eating chinese food that tastes like its been reheated and the chicken is old. You wont get that here. I got delivery or take out from Wai Wai rather frequently and the quality was always consistent. I gave four stars because I tried a few dishes that weren't the best I've ever had but in general and especially in Pittsburgh, I think its a great chinese restaurant. Very tasty and very FRESH."}
{"text":"Great food!!! I order here often. I would recommend the spring rolls. My job order from here frequently and the delivery is always fast and the food is always hot."}
{"text":"I order the honey chicken...and they forgot to rice. So when i called back, all they said was sorry and that was it. ...??? I IWLL NEVER EVER GO BACK...., they just lost a customer. I'm thinking about reporting them to BBB."}
{"text":"It's a nice looking restaurant with standard American-Chinese fare. I just prefer other places. Nice decor and pretty good service, though."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch one day. Really like walking in a place that's clean & inviting. We were greeted right away & told we could sit anywhere. We started off with a pot of Jasmine tea, a favorite of mine. For lunch I ordered the Lo mein w/ shrimp & egg roll on the side. The egg roll was pretty good...Minutes later I got my meal, very surprised how quickly it was prepared..hmmm?? I was really not impressed!  It lacked flavor & kinda dry. I would consider giving a second try though..."}
{"text":"Good standard Chinese fare. Certainly the best we have found within walking distance of Children's Hospital. The boxes are great since they feature 2 entrees with fried rice and egg roll. Reasonable prices and decent quality food. I believe Christina Aguilar's little sister works here. Check it out"}
{"text":"So, I'd like to say before I say anything negative that the pros generally out weigh the cons and I still order chinese food only from wai wai.  That said, the chinese-american food isn't the best I've ever had and it's not very authentic - though good luck finding authentic chinese food if you're unable to speak mandarin or cantonese.  i love the idea behind the boxed lunches and dinners at wai wai, but not being able to pick what you want in them on your own is slightly annoying.  I get the b2 almost every time. The location is easy to pull up to for take-out and the delivery service is great.  The people who staff the restaurant are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"The best cheap Chinese food in Pittsburgh, hands down. Their menu is typical of any cheap Chinese food joint. General Tso's chicken, chicken and broccoli, Szechuan, and other Chinese food regulars are here. Prices are also typical of most Chinese food joints. Most dinner dishes are under or around $10. 

The dinning experience is actually pretty decent. Located in Bloomfield, it's certainly in a prime location. Their are several tables in there, though I've never seen that place packed. It has a quiet atmosphere other than hearing whatever the employees are talking about. I tend to do take-out as most of their customers do. 

They deliver pretty quickly and their food is always made to order. I'm kinda mad that we couldn't get a double order of veggies but I guess they have to have some faults. The food portions are huge and I almost always have leftovers. There's got to be pounds of chicken in the General Tso's chicken and the sweet and sour chicken dishes. Chicken and broccoli comes with tons of broccoli too (which I love).

Overall, this is my favorite Chinese food in the the 'Burgh. They are even willing to deliver out to Millvale sometimes which is an added bonus. You should definitely hit this place up if you're in Bloomfield and you get the urge for some delicious Chinese food at a great price!

{"text":"Consistently good Chinese food delivery. Love the steamed pork dumplings and pork fried rice. Really hits the spot when you're craving guilty-pleasure, savory comfort food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just okay.  Not the best in the area, not the worst.  If you are doing carry-out, go to Green Bamboo.  If you want delivery or dine-in then you have to compromise and go here.  1 star for carry-out, since there is better, but 5 stars for delivery or dine-in because this is the best(only) delivery for when you are too sick or lazy to leave the house."}
{"text":"Get a Lunch or Dinner box.  You can make any minor substitutions with little hassle if its not perfect and its a ton of food for $5.95/$7.95 (lunch/dinner).  Also they deliver and there is always a free table inside.  It isn't gourmet food by any means, but it does a great job for what it is: cheap american-chinese food with a decent flavor that isn't excessively greasy.

If you're going to get full plate meals instead of a box, go down the street to thai cuisine, more expensive, but better food.

{"text":"There were mice.  Huge giant mice in the dining room.  My boyfriend and I didn't make to much of a fuss.  We quietly told the waitress and moved across the dining room.  We would have left but we had already ordered our appetizers. The appetizers were fantastic but the entrees were not.  They had very little flavor and the noodles were soggy and snotty. While we were eating, the one, I'm guessing she was a manager,  ran around with a broom chasing the mice away. She did apologize but would not look us in the eye while doing so.  There was no discount given and for the quality,  the food was way over priced.  They did give us a coupon for a whopping $3 off our next purchase of $21 or more.  We were less than satisfied with our meal, and the show that went along with dinner was not appreciated.  Needless to say we will never be dinning at this establishment again. There are much better places in the city for a similar price without the drama."}
{"text":"Guess it's time to update my review. I've ordered here maybe three times since that incident and haven't had any problems. Seems to be issues only at night. Food has been perfect and definitely my go to Chinese place again. Just wouldn't recommend ordering after 6 PM."}
{"text":"so, i have been to wai wai in the past and i have usually found it to be average tasting chinese food.  My husband loves it, so we tend to go when i am feeling especially loving towards him.  Today, i decided to have delivery since nothing is better than packing for a move with chinese food and beer. I order us up some chicken corn soup, general tso's chicken, hot and sour soup, and orange beef.  Now i usually get tofu or chicken, but I was in a super carnivorous mood, so i thought beef would hit the spot.  

the hot an sour soup, once i picked out the canned mushrooms, was delicious.  it was the orange beef that did me in.  when inspecting it with the plastic cover as a barrier, it looked like this strange bumpy chicken.  Weird, but i have seen chicken fried steak, so i just assumed it was battered.  I put some on my plate with some rice and dug in.

This was some NASTY ASS MYSTERY MEAT!  It was slimy, soft, and not fibrous at all.  This hit the spot on my tongue that almost made me projectile vomit.  I have had orange beef before and this was no orange beef.  this was sugary Purina 1.  I didn't even have to chew, it had a mind of its own and snuck its way into my tummy.

My husband saw how displeased I was and offered me some of his General Tso's and it was soft yet gristly.  what the hell.  

I know for a fact that they would not serve that crap in the restaurant because i have eaten there.  this meal was a mess, a luke warm, zombified pile of crap.  Maybe I ate beef brain instead of Purina 1, either way, it was the pretty gross and disappointing.

This is honestly the worst chinese food i have ever had, and i have been to seriously  grungy looking places.  I gave you guys 3 years of business and i have seen you get worse with each year.  This is the last straw and I will never go back again.  There was no excuse for that beef when you are right next to 2 grocery stores!"}
{"text":"Terrible service over the phone. I could barely get my order out before the lady cut me off to ask me \"is that all\". The first time she did it I said \"let me finish\" the second time I said \"I need to speak with a manager\" she told me there weren't any managers available and hung up. Due to this experience I will not give my money to this business! So sad because its very close to my house."}
{"text":"We use WaiWai quite frequently for Lunch take out.   They have these fantastic \"Lunch Boxes\" that are very reasonable and have a ton of food in them.   

Plan on either drinking a ton of coffee or taking a nap in the afternoon if you get a lunch box."}
{"text":"The most reliable Chinese take out around!  Have ordered here many times and am always satisfied! Prices are great and the staff are some of the most pleasant people! 

They tell you it will be 20-30 mins but I've had my food at my door in less than 10 mins at times."}
{"text":"Always good food and prices!  Their BBQ boneless spare ribs are hands down the best spare ribs I've ever tasted and never disappoint.  The chicken on a stick is also excellent, perfectly cooked and tender.  The rest of the menu is very solid good Chinese food with consistently good quality and portions.  

Their only negative, which lost them a star, is their General Tso's Chicken.  I've ordered it a few times and its typically soggy and lacks any spice or heat instead coming off as an overly sweet almost honey barbecue type flavor.  Being my favorite Chinese dish I'm rather critical of it and theirs leaves much to be desired.  

Overall consistently good food at a decent prices and I highly recommend trying them."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. It arrived pretty quickly. I ordered one of the dinner boxes with szechuan chicken, general Tso and fried rice. The szechuan chicken was alright, not amazing, but ok. The general tso was kind of grisly and not super appetizing. 

All in all, it tasted like any other dime a dozen Chinese place. Nothing special and basically interchangeable with any other common Chinese place."}
{"text":"This was our first visit (had a groupon) and we'd definitely go back.  The cup size wonton soup was huge.  Slivers of carrot and something that I'd guess to be Chinese celery - were crisp and flavorful.  My shrimp in the \"shrimp in lobster sauce\"  were very large and they \"snapped\" when bit or cut into - the mark of fresh and appropriately cooked shrimp in my mind.  It came to the table only luke warm, we asked for it to be heated, and it was, without the shrimp getting overdone.
Our chicken/pork/shrimp noodle dish was perfectly seasoned and flavorful, though the shrimp in this dish were smaller - and didn't have the snap.  But the noodles alone carried the dish.
The tea was served in a small metal pot - which looked really \"authentic\" and added some beauty to the table.  
The waitress who did the entire shift with just one helper (who didn't actually take orders, but she ran dishes out and cleaned tables) for a fairly sizable lunch crowd  was  attentive and friendly.  She knew the menu well and seemed confident and competent.  before we left, we made sure that she knew that we not only enjoyed the food but also appreciated her friendly service. 
the decor is pleasant without the \"traditional\" bright red trappings of some Asian restaurants.
This was the best Chinese lunch we've had in a very long time.  Left overs will make a 2nd lunch tomorrow!
We were glad that the groupon took us there!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Chinese restaurant. All the food tastes terrible and like it came in pre made. The bathroom had no soap and no paper towels (which leads me to believe they both have been out for a good while) and almost no light. The service wasn't bad, but there are a lot of other, better options within immediate walking distance."}
{"text":"It's me again.  I previously wrote sometime ago the trouble we were having when visiting Wai Wai in Bloomfield.  We would enter, be seated and then no one would come to the table....at times past 15 minutes of waiting.  We went back and it seemed like the good old days when the server came over as soon as you were seated.  Unfortunately that lasted only two visits.

Last Friday, 01.08.16, we came in around 4:00 PM.  There was a family having dinner at a table and one woman ordering take out at the counter.  The server came over immediately and I thought that we would be able to pull three in a row.  This was not to happen.  

The server was great, smiling, pleasant and energetic.  Our courses arrived as you would expect.  After getting our entrees, I looked up and saw our server yell out...\"I'll see you in an hour.\"  This was not good.

There were to follow about three people in and out getting take out.  There was one woman behind the counter leaning up against the wall talking to a young man in a coat.  As we finished dinner, I was ready for the check as well as boxes and a bag for the leftovers.  I saw her glance my way so I put my left hand up and waved.  Suddenly, she said something to the guy and the two of them walked down the hallway so that they were out of sight.

This went on for about 12 minutes when I finally went up to the counter and asked for the check and some take out boxes.  Of course, the thought of bringing the check with the boxes would have been too abstract.  This created another wait.  Finally the check was brought, the left overs were packed and she took the check and credit card.  Needless to say, I was not surprised when she didn't return immediately for me to sign the slip.

The food is so good but I wonder if this hassle is worth it anymore.  There was a 'help wanted' sign in the window.  I smiled!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They messed up my order on three different occasions. The dumplings were good. But i won't be ordering from that place ever again . They offered me a 5$ gift card to make up for a 50$ meal that came 2. 30 hours late. Needless to say I turned down their offer and decided to write my firs review on Yelp."}
{"text":"Haven't found a better Chinese restaurant that delivers in the East Liberty area.  Trust me, *most* of the dishes are very good and use good quality ingredients...  If you know of a better Chinese restaurant in the area, let me know :)"}
{"text":"Very average Chinese food. Some of the dishes were on the oily/greasy side. Vegetables overcooked.  The atmosphere is almost fast food Chinese (ie Panda Express), but then they went crazy in a Pier One buying up the Asian stuff.  So they were trying to do better than food court quality."}
{"text":"Very solid American Chinese food. Delivery went smoothly and ahead of schedule. My only complaint is that the Wonton Soup needed some pepper, but that's not too uncommon."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm not a big fan of Chinese to begin with, but my partner wanted to grab a quick lunch here. She had a cup of corn and chicken soup; I, the egg drop soup. When they came, we made sure that our server hadn't mistakenly given us the bowl size. She hadn't. In some places, a cup of soup is usually about two shots worth, but at Wai Wai, the cup is a very generous portion. I found the soup the best part of the meal, though it was probably nothing more than cheap chicken broth and shredded egg whites. The pot of jasmine tea was average and could have used a bit more flavor. 

We shared an order of the honey chicken, again generously portioned. I realize in a place like Wai Wai, raising questions about MSG, as well as whether or not their meat is locally sourced and/or humanely raised (and thus healthy for the consumer) are somewhat unreasonable (even absurd) queries to posit. While my partner and I do care about food awareness and personal health, by choosing to eat here, I suppose we tacitly approved of sloughing off such concerns and slumming it for a meal. All this being said, the mound of honey chicken, surrounded by a ring of steamed broccoli and individual sides of rice, were uninspiring. I took a few bites, and didn't feel the urge to have anymore. Yeah, my aforementioned ethical concerns were the root cause of this, but the food was very middling. There was nothing terrible about it, but it was just your typical, Americanized, unhealthy Chinese food. 

The server was attentive and friendly; we tipped accordingly. I wouldn't go out of my to dissuade the reader from going if he or she is a fan of standard Chinese fare, but I highly doubt I'll find myself in there again."}
{"text":"The food was great! And the driver arrived right on time. I will definitely order delivery from this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I've ate here extensively and have to say I still love them.  Food is great.  Everything I've tried so far has been good.  Their Beef Chow Fun could be better but good enough.  My go to is Crab Rangoon, Chicken-on-a-stick, egg drop soup, Lo Mein, and my new favorite Young Chow Fried Rice.  I've been ordering online and having it delivered too though they just added more fees.  There is a minimum order, a delivery charge, now an online order charge.  Overall, still a good place to eat.  My favorite Chinese food place so far in the city.

I want to give 1 star to their boba drinks.  They suck.  Their boba is undercooked and has no flavor.  *hint* add some brown sugar when cooking.  Also, the one kid that made it for me gave me a drink that was lukewarm.  Seriously,  I had to ask for them to add ice to it.  Luckily their food is still good."}
{"text":"Excellent food at very reasonable prices. Attentive and friendly wait staff, fast service with a smile. The presentation of the food was far above average, a visual delight surpassed only by the superb taste.  For those reasons alone a 5 stars rating is warranted. The simple, efficient atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. Convenient access on a busy downtown street. Looking for a delicious Chinese meal at a surprisingly reasonable price? Wai Wai Chinese Cuisine will not disappoint you. I look forward to many more visits to this gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"A good but not great, tasty but not incredible Chinese joint.

It's nothing to write home about, but it really hits the spot sometimes. Good prices for good portions (I can usually get a dinner and a lunch the next day out of the dinner portions) The dinner boxes are also nice if you can't make up your mind and want to try a lot of stuff.

If you want something out of this world, not your place. But if you're in the mood for some quick Chinese food, definitely a spot."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but a recent visit had me coming away pretty disenchanted.  The problem was I ordered the coconut shrimp and it was not what I expected in a very bad way.  Usually, coconut shrimp has a light batter and tastes of toasted coconuts.  This however, was creamy and way too heavy.  I asked the waitress what the sauce was made of and she said \"mayonaisse.\"  So, the shrimp was sitting on my plate covered in gloopy mayonaisse.  There is a coconut flavor to it, which is good, but I can't bring myself to eat it.  The heavyness of it and the way it sits in your stomach.  I think mayo should be left to topping burgers and sandwiches with, not part of entrees!  Anyways, I explained this to the waitress and she comped me and let me order something else.  I think that they fell gracefully at least.  It does make me question this place quite a bit though moving forward."}
{"text":"Four stars. Would be five but I felt it a ---tad---- expensive for how much you get. Maybe other would disagree.

I got the general tso's chicken,  my husband got the sesame chicken. Admittedly, you can BARELY tell the difference between them in flavor. It's very subtle, but the general tso's seemed to have a bit more spice. We were pleasantly surprised that the sauses were NOT at all goopy, gloppy, or gelatinous. It seems that so much chinese food has sauce that is more like jelly than sauce.

We also each got a chicken egg roll. Delicious, and different. I've never had a chicken egg roll before. Chicken was flavorful and not bland.

Delivery time through grubhub was timely.

We will order again, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"The service has always been \"not so great\", to say the least, but the last time we went, it was so bad, that it was almost comical. The waitress didn't pay any attention to us for about 10 minutes even though not much was going on there. When I got up to get her, she over-the-top apologized, first saying that she thought the other waitress had us, and then a minute later saying that she forgot she hadn't brought us water yet. This pattern of lying repeated itself when my husband got the wrong order and when she disappeared out of the restaurant for extensive periods of time (about 3 times). First she had one \"reason\", then another... By the end, we were both really pissed off and my husband told her that he doesn't care about the \"why\". I did feel bad for her, but she did ruin our dinner. We haven't been back since... and won't ever be again, even though it used to be my favorite spot to grab dinner...Keeping in mind that the service has always been iffy and certainly declined rather than improved over the past year."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through Yelp!  It came incredibly fast - way faster than the estimated time and my mom and I totally appreciated that!

Eh.  It didn't really hit a homerun with me or mom.  We got the Sweet and Sour Chicken / Honey Chicken deal and the Grilled Boneless Spareribs / Chicken on a Stick.  It seemed like a really good idea, but the amount of food was disappointing and the taste was lacking.

If I were in a pinch and wanted something delivered fast, I'd potentially consider Wai Wai again to try something else on their menu...but that's kind of a maybe."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian spots.  The food was really really good.  The service was friendly and the decor was very nice and modern.  It's a really good bargain too.  If I lived closer, I would be hard pressed not to eat there all the time.  Parking can be an issue in Bloomfield, but I try to pick an off-time to stop in and I typically can find something pretty close."}
{"text":"Food was fairly good but spent $170 and no fortune cookies. What has the world come to?"}
{"text":"When you lay down $8.95 for dinner you don't expect much. The gang and I stop by Wei Wei for a \"snack\" a couple of weeks ago. What I thought would be a snack was at least two full meals out of. Of course I was starving, so I ate all of it, but would not have on an average day. And let's talk about these fresh ingredients. I try not to order General Tso's too much because it is basically a heart attack on a plate, but I was in the mood so I went for it. It's one of those things that whenever I order it I'm usually disappointed, but this dish was the exception. I don't think I've ever experienced such crispness from any other General Tso's. Since I ordered a dinner box I also have the chance to try the steamed shrimp, egg roll, and rice. I'm not much of an egg roll fan but it was pretty good and the steam shrimp was among the better I have had in the city. For eight bucks I'd eat it everyday if my heart could take it!"}
{"text":"Waited 3 hours for delivery and the guy on the phone said \"All deliveries are out, I don't know what to tell you\". He was unhelpful and didn't care one bit."}
{"text":"First time getting takeout there, egg rolls were not great but meal (seafood delight and chicken in bean sauce) were good."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's cheap Chinese takeout (get the dinner box!) but the atmosphere is also nice enough to eat there if you'd prefer. I've done both and had great experiences every time. They also make your food more spicy for you if you request it...few Chinese places I've been to will really do that. I spent months looking for a Chinese place in Pittsburgh as good as the one in the town where I went to college, and I'm happy to have found one in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A+ for my 1st trip. Took the boss here today. Had heard good things...they were spot on! Service was super friendly and insightful. And oh yeah, the food was great! Portions HUGE! Price was very fair. For $10 you can eat, have some left over & leave a tip! Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"the pluses?  it's in my 'hood.  it's cheap.  you can get lunch \"boxes\" (a combination of 3 different standard chinese dishes) for about $6 and dinner boxes for about $8.  it's clean inside, and you get the feeling they're trying a little too hard to look modern.  generally, the waitstaff is nice and attentive.

my big complaint?  the food is good for sure but kinda boring.  spicy dishes just don't pack a lot of punch, and the veggies seem universally semi-wilted.  they don't have signature dishes, and because of that i find myself sticking to the american favorites of egg rolls with sesame chicken, general tso's, and chicken & broccoli.  again -- all fine but by no means outstanding.

still, i'll happily take a sit-down chinese place just a few blocks away from home on those days that i don't feel like making the drive to squirrel hill or downtown."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad.  I enjoyed what I had.  Why does it feel like there's a but coming?  Because there is.

But...the General Tso's wasn't spicy enough for me.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't up to par for me.  I don't believe I ever saw a pepper in the sauce at all.  I suppose I should add that this was part of a large order placed for delivery.  With it being delivery and all that jazz, you would expect it to come with utensils or maybe even chopsticks.  None came with it, or maybe it did, the bag seems to have disintegrated when attempting to take the order to it's destination.  So if there was utensils of any type in there, they may have been lost.

I will order from here again, but next time I'll be sure to mention that there is utensils with the next delivery."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Chinese delivery spot. They have great options at great prices and they are beyond generous with sauces, condiments, and fortune cookies. 

My personal favorites include: 1) the crab rangoons-fluffy and delicious. 2) the Dragon and the Phoenix. It's a great combo of general tso's chicken and tangy shrimp. 

The delivery has never been more than 45 minutes and everything arrives hot. The drivers are prompt and friendly. 

I can't speak to the restaurant since I've never eaten there, but if you are looking for some tasty delivery this is a great spot."}
{"text":"WaiWai can best be described as Modern Asian Fusion cuisine.  I stopped here for lunch after doing some shopping in Bloomfield (i.e. Donatelli's, etc).  They've got a strikingly modern decor with traditional Chinese art, so it's kind of like mixing a sushi place with an old school Chinese restaurant.  

WaiWai has a lot of neat lunch options.  You can order the standard lunch specials just like you can at any other Chinese joint.  Or you can order one of 12 lunch boxes.  The boxes generally have two types of meat with fried rice.  Not a big fan of fried rice myself, but I did find one good choice.  #B6 is a combination of chicken, beef, or shrimp (I went with the shrimp) with mixed vegetables and General Tso's Chicken.  Oooh, a bit spicy, but I loved it!  And of course you get an egg roll with each box.  This girl's gotta have her egg roll!

Rick and I are gonna have to come back here for dinner sometime.  They've got an interesting way to order.  You start by choosing your type of meat, then you choose the style you want it.  You can get Hunan Style with vegetables, curry, mixed vegetables, etc.

This isn't your normal neighborhood Chinese joint.  If Pittsburghers have a reputation for being less than culinarily adventurous, this place will shatter that illusion.  It's a great addition to Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Alright! I recently moved to Lawrenceville and have been looking for Chinese delivery to replace the ol' China Palace I had in in Monroeville. Along comes Wai Wai. 

I'm quite pleased with the selection of dishes. The portions are good sized. Prices are cheap! Delivery was standard 30-45 minutes.

The food itself passes muster. I think it's actually an upgrade over China Palace. I'll happily order from Wai Wai when I'm craving American Chinese delivery food!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday ..food was average for a chinese place nothing special but all of us got diarrhea..someone had written about mice running around 20 days ago ..should have taken the hint..FIRST AND LAST VISIT EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, portions are super generous, and their delivery is quick and accurate!  Probably the best choice for Chinese food in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"wow. have been ordering from them for months... accidentally ordered dark meat this last time and I called to change it and got a very nasty woman who did not know how to charge my card the extra (ridiculous that they charge more for white meat, anyway), basically said kitchen was too busy and had to go and that I could call eat street to cancel. I can't be bothered to deal with restaurants that don't have the time to help me - or recognize customers that order weekly. just greedy for money, I guess."}
{"text":"I asked to substitute veggies for meat, they were definitely not familiar with such a request.
The green tea was good quality, but not served that hot.
The Food tasted good, but it also tasted re-heated.
Very dim lighting, a bit too dim for my preferences.
The bubble tea was tasty but too sweet.

I probably won't come back because it is, in nearly every aspect, a notch below what I usually expect at a decent sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good. Solid! And the prices are fair. The service has been exceptional. I love that on that rough day you can order, pay, leave tip and have all delivered on time without having to talk to a human. You know those days when you just can't talk to another human? Wai Wai makes that day perfect."}
{"text":"If there were half stars, I would give this a 3.5.  This is a very competent chinese restaurant.  I have only eaten take out from here but my sense of the interior is very favorable.  It is very relaxed and more of a japanese vibe than a chinese red banner and tassel vibe.  The Singapore noodles are particularly delicious.  The other entrees are on a par or better than average.  It is probably fair to say that their menu is too extensive and geared to the western palate (they try a number of asian dishes that may be beyond their ken).  My kids love their chicken on a stick and crab rangoons--and I like them as well (much as I hate to admit that I like pseudo chinese food with deep-fried wontons filled with crab flavored cream cheese--cream cheese?  Cream cheese in asian food?).  The Crab Rangoons are quite honestly an abomination, but a yummy one at that."}
{"text":"I think How Lee, the Sesame Inn, and China Palace are the best Chinese places in Pgh.  Lulu's is okay too... Mandarin Gourmet...  ok most chinese places are better than Wai Wai.

Everyone loves Wai Wai....and i dont get it.  Why?  Why?

This is run of the mill, Panda express style chinese food.  You're going to get greasy, gristly chicken and bland, soggy beef.

HOWEVER, on occasion I will order from Wai Wai because their vegetables are fantastic.  Super fresh, steamed and tasty!  You are good with any veggie dish.  If you order a tofu dish it will be swimming in grease though.

Their food is also consistent, and sometimes you want crappy chinese food and you want the crappy chinese food you know.

It's not hte best chinese, I\"m not even sure it's good chinese.  it's just ok, and greasy.

Order from China Palace instead, they deliver to the same areas.  Or How Lee."}
{"text":"There is nothing authentic about this place. its American Chinese food.

The food is really bland, they give you a decent amount of rice but they're really stingy with any of the meat. The service there was really poor too, the staff ~ they just weren't very friendly. don't bother refilling drinks. The food's cheap so thats at least one plus

Its a good spot if you just want to fill up and pick up but if i'm trying to go to a nice sit down place its not here."}
{"text":"Well, what used to be a good option for Chinese in the Bloomfield area quickly has become a bad choice if you actually want to get what you ordered and paid for.  

We ordered delivery as we now live in the neighborhood... somehow Orange Chicken (which we had a discussion with them on and they said they could make with all white meat for an extra charge) became Mongolian Beef as it made its way to polish hill.  So basically, my husband was unable to eat what we had ordered for him and what had paid about $15 for.  Total disappointment.  

My chicken and broccoli was good but the container was way too filled with sauce (I asked for light sauce which to me, meant less sauce, but definitely not to them).  

I was really upset by this... we thought that we had a good Chinese option nearby and now we will have to explore or drive.  Cannot say we want to go back after this last debacle.  

If anyone has any good Chinese recs over this way, please let me know!"}
{"text":"A little less than mediocre Chinese food but it is what it is. Has some really good lunch and dinner special prices though. Nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"There are not many Asian places that will deliver to the Polish Hill area, so I occasionally order from Wai Wai. The food is OK and it's cheap with nice sized portions, where you'll most likely have some leftovers. The meals I've had are typically what I would expect of fast-food American Chinese food. I've had the General Tso's, Chicken & Broccoli and Shrimp Lo Mein and a few others and they were all good. My favorite part of the meal was the Crab Rangoons. You can't go wrong with fried dough and cream cheese, but I've been very disappointed at other places where they are dry and practically empty on the inside. Their rangoons actually have a good amount of filling. 

Good for a quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"The wait staff employees are very very sweet.  Friends and I go back mainly because of their kindness.  However their grill teriyaki is deep fried.  It can be very greasy at times.  It is not grilled as the menu indicates.  Okay giving them the benefit of the doubt, there may be some grilling to it, but it is definitely has deep frying to it, despite what I have been told."}
{"text":"Ive been eating at Wai's since it opened. The food is always good. But, when I call to order pick-up, Ive come to expect a rude voice on the other end, never helpful or professional . Ive even told Wai but shes always said \"we do very well\" so I assumed either she didnt grasp the concept of good customer service or didnt care. I still ate the food because its great. But Im happy to say that today when I ordered, a gentleman answered the phone and he was so polite, helpful, professional, and obliging. I am so happy hes there because now they have both good help and good food. I dont know this guys name, but I hope he stays because he is excellent."}
{"text":"summary: clueless service, limited menu, mediocre food.

I walked into the place knowing that they serve Americanized Chinese food, so I am prepared for that. The rating is based on comparison with other restaurants of its type (the most mass-market example being P.F. Chang).  

Wai Wai belongs to a new class of American Chinese restaurants that try to shake off the dingy \"takeout place\" image. The decor has a more modern sensibility to it than, say, Jimmy Tseng's. Think Starbucks meets Asian tea house. The menu, though, looked just like the one from a takeout place twenty years ago. Here you'll find things like pu pu platter and honey chicken. I was disappointed that the entree list was pretty basic. There were only four vegetarian options, and the content of the dish was pretty much just the single ingredient (e.g., a plate of stir-fried eggplant) which makes it look more like a side dish than someone's dinner. 

The food was largely forgettable. The appetizers I tried (fried dumplings, spring roll, crab rangoon) were ok -- though hard to go wrong with deep fried stuff. I was underwhelmed by my main dish (the eggplant). The plate had an island of rice and an island of eggplant surrounded by a sea of brown sauce.  The sauce is overly sweet and goopy, but the eggplant itself had too little seasoning to stand on its own.  The one good thing about the food was that the vegetables were fresh and not overcooked. The string beans were still crunchy and the eggplant still vibrantly purple. The shrimp, however, was probably from frozen.

My strongest impression of the place might be the clueless waiter we had. As soon as we sat down, he asked for our drink orders, even though we didn't know what they had to offer.  The menu actually doesn't list their drinks, but the waiter didn't volunteer to tell us what they had. To order some tea, it took couple rounds of back and forth with the waiter to settle the matter. When ordering our food, I had some questions about the dishes (like, is the chow mein the thin and crispy kind?).  The waiter's response was \"I don't know, I haven't tried it.\" (Hadn't he served it to other customers? Was he not paying attention?) Upon further interview, it turned out that he had only sampled one dish of this restaurant, and he didn't have anything to say about even that dish.  Even a new hire ought to do better, surely?

Bottom line: even for American Chinese food, I've had better. If I should ever be struck by a craving for General Tsao's, I'd probably go take my chances at  Richard Chen or Plum or whatever Asian restaurant standing on that space then."}
{"text":"THE WORST!!!!! Our office has ordered numerous times from this establishment and have asked on every occasion for Chinese mustard and it is never delivered. We decided today to give it one more shot and once again what you order is not delivered. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oooooof.  Bought takeout for Christmas Eve, remembering that a friend ordered there a lot in college.

Super greasey (yea, even on the American Chinese food scale.  It was dripping), not that flavorful, and instantly gave me stomach pain.

Will not be back."}
{"text":"I love their Mango Bubble Tea and their dumplings. The atmosphere is really nice inside. I didn't find it mediocre at all."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for Chinese food in the city with the best deal. The dinner boxes are so good and very reasonable. Take out is always ready in a very timely manner. Love Wai Wai!"}
{"text":"So this place is sometimes delicious and sometimes average- never bad though. Love general tso chicken- one time it'll be on the soggy side and the next it is crispy and spicy and so good. The crab rangoon are tasty as well as the dumplings. I don't care for the fried rice because it's usually pretty greasy. Over all it's just ok. I never eat in so I don't know how the service is. Pickup and delivery are fine."}
{"text":"Food tastes great.  Dinner boxes are a steal.  Oh and they have the fastest delivery around."}
{"text":"Wai Wai is the sister restaurant to Lin's Asian Fusion. Rather than being a Pan-Asian experience, though, it tends to stick entirely with Chinese-inspired cuisine. A notch above the Chinee-Takee-Outee experience -- I get that name from an actual Chinese take-out in Gainesville, Florida -- but a notch below a full-fledged Chinese restaurant, I was drawn in by the familiar architecture and the promise of Bubble Tea.

I ordered the Taro Bubble Tea without sweetener. Same exact flavor as Lin's and so I was quite happy. Just need almond or pineapple and all would be right in the world (hint, hint.)  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I am no stranger to Wai Wai. Out of all of the local restaurants that you can eat in, this is probably the one I frequent the most. 

Since I've been back so often (really more often than I should be comfortable admitting, there have to be groups for this sort of addiction) I felt as if I should write a new review for them as well. 

Let's talk drinks. I'm not a fan of sucking black tapioca balls through a giant straw so the bubble tea is not for me. I have had two different types of smoothies there, the mango and the pineapple. I don't know if it's a mix or something fresher that they use, but it's delish every single time. A drink being delicious isn't all though, it's also served in a nice big red wine glass and it's heaping over. I'm also a fan of the hot oolong tea. 

The other topic I wanted to address is the crab rangoon. Dear sweet crispy cheese lord... I would have never tried it as I don't often eat anything other than fish here and there. I can't believe I almost didn't get the ultimate joy of eating these cheese hot crunchy fried triangles.

As always I'd very strongly suggest stopping in here. Eat some crispy triangles and have a smoothie!!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Bloomfield I LOVED ordering from Wai Wai. I'm talking 5* up and down, but oh how times have changed. These are my last 4 experiences (in a row):

1st I tried to order vegetable won tons, but they were out. Tried to switch to vegetable dumplings. Also out. I know things happen, but are you just out of vegetables? If so, tell me that maybe? I rattled off a few more vegetarian options to no luck and an employee so rude I decided I'd just take my business elsewhere.

2nd time I ordered successfully, but somehow going from Bloomfield to Squirrel Hill (under 15 min drive) took 90 mins instead of the 45 I was told. I called 3 times and was met with nothing but attitude. My $10 food was cold when it arrived, and this was the first time I noticed how much smaller the portions had gotten (this was 2012 compared to 2009-2011). There was no refund, no apology, and to top it off the order wasn't even correct. That's when I decided I'd never give them another dime.

3rd time was a work order and, long story short, NOTHING we ordered was right. The food containers look like they literally THREW them into the bags. It was pathetic.

And finally, the most recent time my roommates ordered \"Fried\" pork dumplings. Apparently in this restaurant \"fried\" is just another word for \"steamed\" and when they called back to report the mistake the response was \"That's just how they're made, we're really busy. If there isn't a 'REAL' reason for you to call I need to go. Sorry for your misunderstanding.\"

Seriously? I'd suggest literally ANY restaurant in the city before this place. Horrible customer service and the food isn't even as tasty as it once was. Really sad to see such a great Chinese place become one of the worst I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with."}
{"text":"This was the place open on Christmas and I was starving. I got delivery and they were prompt with my order. The food is very good. All in all satisfied."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Clean place, food is consistent."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood Chinese Restaurant this place goes above and beyond. Cute, cozy decor, friendly staff and a large enough menu to satisfy any voracious appetite.

They are also very accommodating when it comes to Boba Tea. The selection is not huge, but they make it quite well. I must say I like the tea more than the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The hotel concierge was nice enough to recommend this place for delivery (yay!!! [especially on an early morning travel day, yet working til midnight]). 

Food arrived, with no way to take a credit card, yet I wasn't asked if I was paying with a credit card when I placed my order, nor when I called back the second time to see if they needed my hotel room #, or would just call from the lobby. So, I didn't get a receipt, even though I was using a business card (and needed one for expenses). Not awesome.

On food, I ordered a cup of the hot & sour soup, yet the utensils I was given did not include a spoon - only a fork, knife, and chopsticks. Ummm. You know I'm American in America. And you clearly gave me the fork and knife, why not throw in a spoon? (I got one from my hotel.)

Soup was not tasty, btw.

Then there was the main problem: the entree - \"Happy Family,\" which was anything but happy. Poor quality chicken and shrimp (but those were the best). The beef was not good, and the pork was inedible. The scallops were also terrible.

Do not recommend (no matter the mis-perceived convenience)."}
{"text":"They have really great yummy Chinese food here ... Good for date night or out with the kids..."}
{"text":"I walked into this place without checking previous reviews.  The price was right in the window menu & Chinese seemed like a good idea. 

The first thing I noticed was that Wai Wai was nicely decorated.  Second, it was nearly empty on Wednesday night at 6PM.  The emptiness made me nervous.  Most of the time, a fancy, empty restaurant means one of two things: a) the food is bad or b) the service is bad.  Neither of these things turned out to be true.  The food & service were both fantastic.  Please note, though, I am not a Chinese food purist.  I love the Americanized version of Chinese food.  The crab rangoon was delish.  The wonton soup was tasty.  I ordered the chicken cashew entree & had enough food for lunch the next day, which was auspicious since my fortune cookie suggested I eat more Chinese food to stay healthy.

The dining room is BYOB, so if you're doing a date night, bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The server spilled hot food on me and did not even acknowledge, let alone say sorry. She was flat out mean. I would rather starve than eat here again."}
{"text":"I lived in Bloomfield for 3.5 years and this was my go-to place for Chinese take-out.  They definitely had off-days, but overall the food here was hot, fresh, and tasty.  Veggies were almost always crisp and fresh, and the tofu dishes were flavorful.  This is still fairly run-of-the mill Chinese, but it was consistently good and not too terribly expensive for those nights when you need take-out."}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say about the food except it's very average. 

This restaurant was solidly average in many ways.  I got two lunch boxes (which consisted of meat, meat, meat and a side of stir fried rice...with meat). Besides the fact that it was super cheap and they conveniently deliver, I don't think I was satisfied.  The chicken with broccoli killed it for me, the chicken didn't taste like chicken...but like a lesser, mediocre version of chicken.  

I'd definitely give this place another go because I'm cheap and lazy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 3 other girls we got the lunch special bento box. It was so much food! We'll have lunch for tomorrow leftover. I had the B1 General tso's and beef and broccoli. Well worth it for $6.95."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until today, I'll never order from them again. I get the same dish every time and the chicken has always been good but tonight all the chicken in the General Tsos dish was pink. Did not look right. Called, took them 1 hr to deliver a new order of general Tsos chicken and it was still PINK and weird colored. Wai Wai lost a long time customer due to poor quality."}
{"text":"Pretty good place in Bloomfield.  Real nice location and decor.  Nice staff."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 1pm for lunch. The place was empty except for two other people waiting on someone for lunch. One thing I noticed is how dark it is in there. It legit looked like no one turned the lights on. My mom noticed that the ceiling was painted black, so maybe that had something to do with it? 

Innywho, the service was entirely too slow for a place that only had one other table when we first got there. The Oolong tea I had was great until I got down to the bottom of the pot, and there was a very distinct metal flavor. It also took about half an hour for our food to be served, which only added to my annoyance. 

The only thing that made this trip better than my previous trip was that my portion was huge and I the dish I had (Beef Chow Fun) was delicious! It was so much that I had to take some home, and I'm always a girl who can finish her plate. The taste was your typical Americanized Chinese stuff, so don't expect the moon, but it was better than I previously remembered."}
{"text":"You really need to double think before ordering delivery here. I've been ordering from them for years for work and as well for personal orders. Delivery takes FOREVER and they refuse to recognize any wrong doing or offer any refunds for incorrect orders. They have atrocious customer service and almost seem like they're bothered that you're ordering from them.

I'm so frustrated because (mostly for work) I've given them probably close to $8k in sales over the last few years (college students are hungry!). This last time when a seminar was ruined after they messed up two previous orders as well was just the last straw.

The only reason they don't get a single star is because their food is good, so whatevs."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best Chinese food I've found, delivery or eating in I am always happy!!"}
{"text":"Some background about the setup: Customers can walk in and order take out at the counter, or be seated by a waiter to eat in. While we were there for around 1.5 hours, only one other group was seated but around 4 people came in to pick up their take out. 

I came here with my family around 3:30, just past the designated lunch period, so we were stuck with the dinner menu. No biggie. 

The waiter was super attentive and polite, timely and conscious of water refills.
We all went with the plate sets which is cheap at around $10 for HUGE portions! None of us could finish. I ordered General Gao's Chicken with broccoli and beef and white rice. The food is pretty average to above average American-Chinese food, nothing really authentic here. Much better than Panda Express though! I guess the one authentic thing was the music they were playing, it was straight from the mainland. My Mom loved it. 

Overall, the atmosphere was inviting, waitstaff was great, and the food, although not authentic, was above the average American-Chinese. Will probably drop by again!"}
{"text":"Good food, cheap prices, and never a wait to eat-in."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get Chinese food. And I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food...lol, so how is it that I have a spot? Well...first off they take credit cards. Secondly they are super convenient to my house. And thirdly, the food is good. I've never eaten in the restaurant...only ordered takeout. My only complaint,  I wish they had a parking lot...because sometimes finding parking on Liberty Ave. is a beast."}
{"text":"First thoughts: Stopped in for takeout earlier today. Prices are very reasonable but menu is a bit confusing. For instance, dinner combos feature 3 (!) different proteins over rice. Why? And they don't even go together. Shrimp w/ broccoli, General Tso's and orange chicken over chicken fried rice. Want to 'upgrade' that chicken fried rice to pork fried? That'll be $3 extra. 

Quality: Rice was horrible and hard. Definitely tasted undercooked. Shrimp was mushy and seemed old. The only redeeming thing was the egg roll which was perfect: crisp, good filling, and not greasy. 

I wouldn't go back. And you shouldn't give it a try either."}
{"text":"Quality Chinese cuisine. Large portions for low prices. Best crab rangoon in town (although, some people might find it to be too sweet). I'm not a fan of their bubble tea. I just don't have a taste for it. I wish they served egg foo young. Their lunch specials/boxes and dinner boxes are worth a try! Their General Tso's recipe is very delicious."}
{"text":"Bad! The sweet and sour chicken was extremely light on the vegetables. There were 4 small pieces of green peppers, no more than 3 small pieces of onion and no pineapple whatsoever. Not a single piece. The plain fried rice was very oily."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  When I lived in Lawrenceville, we spent many a night here for dinner.  It's sometimes hard to find good Chinese food that's not sketchy in and around this neighborhood.  

The dinner boxes are awesome - $8 - $10 for what is easily 2 or 3 meals.  You can't beat that.  And the fact that it's BYOB is awesome.  My last visit was with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday.  We had 6 people, 2 bottles of wine and some beers and the service was great.  We left with a ton of leftovers, and the bill was incredibly reasonable - even with the corkage fee.  Speaking of, unlike a lot of BYOB places, this place charges a set $5 fee for the whole table regardless of how many people you have.  Personally, I think that's a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"After ordering from Wai Wai we will never order Chinese elsewhere. Everything is delicious, my favorite being the chicken on a stick and crab Rangoon. Highly recommend, quick delivery and decent prices."}
{"text":"I swear I've heard people call Wai Wai a \"dive\" or some other such word with a negative connotation many times over the years. After witnessing co-workers nosh on Wai Wai's takeout fare frequently, Kay and I opted to dine-in there a week or so ago, and were pleasantly surprised by their swanky decor, friendly service, and above-par food. 

We ALWAYS order Steamed Dumplings, and we do so because they're usually addictive (gimme two orders and nothing else and I could be happy), and WW's  meaty, doughy, stout version is not to be passed over. 

For my entree, I requested the Sha Cha, which consists of onion, celery, a medley of vegetables including bamboo shoots, and mushrooms in the titular sauce with whatever proteins you choose. I went \"Mixed,\" meaning I got a nice helping of ably cooked and hefty poultry, shrimp, and beef chunks to go with my freshly-cut vegetables, fungi, and white rice. Overall, I enjoyed the dish, the sauce being particularly savory and dynamic. 

I do not recall what Kay had other than the Mango Bubble Tea. I had a taste and uh, well...the gummi beans pretty much make the iced drink thing sing. Without the gelatinous beans, you're left with cloudy, bland Kool-Aid. I'm just callin' it as I taste it, kiddies. A fad? I wager it'll fade away in ten years. 

NEXT ON  VH-1's I LOVE THE 2010'S...

B-List Celebrity Talking Head #1 (The soft-core porn actress/music video bimbo/centerfold): \"Remember bubble tea? It was so weird. Me and my friends loved it for some reason.\"

B-List Celebrity Talking Head #2 (The out-of-the-limelight sit-com actor): \"You had to drink it through this big, thick straw...\"

B-List Celebrity Talking Head #3 (Dorky comedian drinking some bubble tea): \"Sllluuuurrrrppp. Hmmm. This is strangely sexual.\" [Feigns choking on beans]

B-List Celebrity Talking Head #4 (Sassy, overweight actress/comedian): Boy, we need some Heimlich up in here! We never had that crazy shit in my neighborhood. Mmmhmmm. We drank us some Snapple or Ne-Hi.\"

And this is when I usually change the channel after finding no music...

P.S. A bunch of Anglo hipsters work the tables, oddly enough. They were all nicely efficient, however."}
{"text":"Pure Americanized-Chinese comfort food! 

Everything is always fresh and hot and hugely portioned. The only misses I've had here are the rangoons - and they weren't terrible per se, but just.. meh. The rest of the menu makes up for it in my book."}
{"text":"As a regular customer here, I gotta say this is the best American Chinese food in the town. (Disclaimer: American Chinese not authentic Chinese) I have both dinned in and taken out quite often, so both are petty good. However, the only drawback is that if you do delivery, they always fail to accommodate any need (for instance, bring a pair of chopsticks or some utensils), and sometimes the driver can be very rude..."}
{"text":"Tasty and very affordable. For the money and speed of service,  you cannot go wrong with this place. Super good and fresh tasting food with a very speedy service for takeout or delivery. 

Spring rolls are delicious and light... very nice size for an order. All other chinese places do not compare in regards to size of portions and price. Love me some wai wai!"}
{"text":"Overall, my experience with Wai Wai was pretty average. I ordered a General Tso's/Beef and Broccoli dinner box, with a side of crab rangoons and spring rolls. The food was good, nothing special, but I was pleased. The delivery took a little too long though. I'm only a mile away from the store so I don't feel like it should have taken nearly 45 minutes. 

I would order from here again because of the proximity. I would recommend it as a decent option for anyone in the area who's looking for inexpensive Chinese food, and isn't in too much of a hurry to get it."}
{"text":"I LOVE their lunch boxes!
However, who knows but... I don't feel like they are changing their cooking oil too often...

Update: quality of food is consistency along with super fast delivery."}
{"text":"I just like this place.  It is nice inside, never too crowded at dinner (lunch usually is), the service is good.  The food is really good, for Americanized Chinese food, and the prices are ridiculous.  My wife eat here at least once a week and for the two of us, with two entrees, app, and soft drinks it comes to less than $25."}
{"text":"We have ordered here so many times and their food is so good!!!! The only thing is their delivery is soooo long. We only live a 5 min drive away and it takes them an hour every single time we order. 

We just moved to this new location in Pittsburgh so we tried a bunch of different Chinese deliveries and this one has the best food. Their general tsaos ISNT gooey or gelatinous (agreeing with another yelper). I haven't been able to find a place that makes general tsaos normal, and not jelly like. But this place does. Sometimes it's a little too crunchy for me but other than that it's good. 


Their chicken and broccoli is amazing also. I just wish they had sushi. I recommend, but order extra early!!"}
{"text":"Wai-Wai is delicious.  They have everything you would expect a chinese restaurant to have, nothing fancy, no frills, just good take-out/delivery quality food.  They always deliver quickly and seem to be the only Asian cuisine restaurant in the neighborhood that is open on Monday (weird)."}
{"text":"A neighborhood place I've been to many times yet have never reviewed. Jeez. Anyway, it's a fairly priced spot with good lunch specials. Americanized but authentic if that makes sense. Have never had a problem with the food here. Always tastes good and friendly service too."}
{"text":"Just what I like in Chinese food. Cheap and too much food to possibly eat in one sitting. Ok, maybe I did eat it all. Moving on....I feel like you never really know what you're going to get in a Chinese restaurant. Whenever I would go to Chinese buffet's with my dad he would meow like they were cooking cats. OBVIOUSLY, since I'm a crazy cat lady I wouldn't stand for that, plus I know that's a silly concept. But I digress. 

The place was very clean and the service was great! I had the Lo Mien Shrimp Noodles and a another dose of shrimp in an egg roll. I like my Lo Mien tasty and full of the whatever meat or veggie you order and simple request was filled! And NO ONE wants a limp mushy egg roll, so thankfully mine was crisp and again, filled with some big pieces of shrimp. I always get nervous going into a new restaurant like I'm on a first date...and thank gawd my first date was a success, with the restaurant I mean!"}
{"text":"Great egg rolls! The chicken egg rolls were the best I've had. I always say: \"you can tell how good a Chinese restaurant is by their egg rolls.\" Wow, this place ranks high because their egg rolls are so very tasty. I've actually never had any other food here, just each kind of egg roll they serve. If you go here, you must get the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken egg roll and Mongolian beef.  The egg roll was excellent, and the Mongolian beef tasted good but had a sauce that was a little runny.  Portions were big enough for 2-3 meals.  Much better than other Chinese takeout restaurants I've tried in the area."}
{"text":"I hate the fact that I live not even a 10 minute walk to this place. I am here at least 2 or 3 times a WEEK! Their dinner boxes make it so easy to avoid cooking. It's so cheap, it's so delicious. When I order delivery they're super quick (living so close probably helps with that though). The man who delivers is always the same guy and he's so nice.

I love their plain lo mein."}
{"text":"They have the best tasting Chinese in the area.  After 5 delivery orders everything has been delicious and consistent.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you live in the area."}
