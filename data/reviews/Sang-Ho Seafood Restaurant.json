{"text":"Ate here last on December 22nd, 2012.  Food quality is very consistent at this great Chinese restaurant.  The food comes out piping hot and I don't recall at anytime that the food was bad here.  The owner and servers recognize most of us, so we always have great service.  Their notable dishes include crispy fried chicken, curry beef brisket, sweet and sour pork, taro duck, stir-fried lobsters, fried garoupa fish with sweet corn sauce, stirred fried snow pea leaves with garlic, and many more.  Their prices are also very reasonable (it often works out to be like $12-$15 per person).  They provide complimentary Chinese soup (lai tong) and dessert (depending on the day, tofu fah or sweet red bean soup may be available). Love Sang-Ho!

Parking:  Plenty of metered street parking on Dundas St W.  Inexpensive indoor garage parking available across the street at Dragon City Mall (Impark: $5 all day parking) &  the building  (Noble: $4 all day parking) next to it.   Both garage entrances are located in the laneway between Dragon City Mall and Pho Pasteur Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Fair prices, good food, friendly staff. The food personally didn't blow me out of my chair but was quite enjoyable at a seemingly fair price point."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant randomly, based on finding a parking spot (it's like tossing a dart at a dartboard) and was rewarded with possibly THE BEST CHINESE BEEF DISH I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  This from a seafood restaurant?  Even the waiter suggested we come back and try their seafood -- and we will.  The dish, \"Beef Tenderloin on Sizzling Hot Plate\", sounds pretty standard, but the sauce was delicate, peppery, had glorious depth and complexity and had us all in awe.  It was an incredible delight to the senses and when it was gone I wanted to cling to the empty plate in hopes of wiping any other leftovers into the last of the sauce.  If the rest of their dishes compare, I'm going to move in there forever."}
{"text":"The crab was amazing! Ask them to cook it a bit spicy. We picked out the crab and a sea bass from the tank and it was promptly cleaned and cooked. Approx. $30 for the crab that I thought was very good value for money."}
{"text":"Having dinner and lunch here during my 1st Toronto visit from 29 Sep - 04 Oct 2011. So happening I saw this restaurant on the night before I left (I found this restaurant too late) and me and my sister ordered lobsters and vegetable (luo han zai) as our dinner.  Wow... the taste of the food is nice and the service s extremely good (as compared the previous restaurant that we tried in Chinatown as well). The staffs here are friendly and nice. They are patient and answered all kind of questions about the food. They let you take your time to order the food as me and my sisters were a bit slow and need more time in reviewing the menu.I love the lobsters ( cooked with garlic & onion).  On the next day (the day we left Toronto), we went to this restaurant again and ordered eggplant and steamed fish .  The food are nice as well. 
Highly recommend this restaurant for whoever visit Chinatown in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is great. The ingredients are fresh. This used to be a great place to hang out but ever since change of employees, the service has gone very bad. The owner is still very nice but the waitress is rude. Discovered hair in my food more than once, showed her. She didn't even acknowledge, simply took away the hair and left. When asked to have that item removed from the bill, she simply said, \"well you did eat some of the food\". What? Really?"}
{"text":"Their food is great. The problem is they cheat with their lobsters. When you order two lobster special, the lobsters only have one hand. The dish came with two hands instead of four. Why??? I asked manager and she said sometimes lobster came with one hand. Ok, get it. I have seen some lobsters in the past. But both lobsters? I asked another waiter and he told me all the special lobsters have only one hand. So that's how SPECIAL their lobsters are here!"}
{"text":"My favourite spot for Cantonese style seafood restaurant in Toronto Chinatown.  They have full stock of live, fresh seafood as well as finfish and shellfish.  The lobster special is good value for two but I prefer large lobster, which has more meat.  The atmosphere is quite family oriented and the service has always been friendly and helpful.  Occasionally they serve different kinds of crab depending on the season, but Dungeness crab and softshell crab are the common.  My family never likes deep fried style so we always opt for stir fried.  Steamed oyster with garlic is my favour as well as it is always fresh, but sometimes the size is rather small so I guess it has to do with season and supply.  The other thing I really like is they give free homy style soup and Cantonese dessert which are always yummy.  The staffs and owner here always try to engage you in conversation unlike many other Chinese restaurants which they just try to rush you off.  The price is very reasonable consider the quality and quantity you are getting.  Their daily lunch special is a bargain!  For $5.75-$7.00, you've got wide variety of rice and noodle/vermicelli items to choose from and come with a bowl of daily soup.  Too bad I don't work nearby, otherwise I'd probably save lots of money and hassle by ordering here."}
{"text":"Good, but not great. We had the 2 lobsters with garlic and ginger. While the lobster was flavorful and cooked well, there was hardly any taste of ginger and garlic. We ordered spinach as a side dish and we received mostly a plate of stems, dripping with oil. The eggplant and tofu in green pepper was the best of the dinner. The place is cute and charming and reasonably priced, but they need to step up the seasoning."}
{"text":"My last two experiences at this restaurant were really quite unfortunate. I will preface all of this with my memory of having a really good seafood meal here in the distant past, which is why I keep coming back in hopes of reliving that experience, but to no avail. 

I was here some time last month with my family and ordered a combo meal that was really just not that good. The quality of the ingredients were average, the flavors were meh, and I truly cannot find one thing that stood out to me. And the time before that, the waitress had talked us into ordering some live fish for $25/lb, that turned out to be quite bland and unmemorable...well, I guess it was memorable because it was ridiculously expensive, but that was about it. 

I will pass on a third try."}
{"text":"If I lived in Chinatown, I would come here every day instead of cooking at home (more delicious and more cost effective haha). 

Located on Dundas just half a block west of Spadina and its entrance is a couple steps up from the sidewalk. A no frills type of restaurant and the owners are friendly. 

The lunch specials are amazing. The portions are quite big and you can get rice, noodles, Cantonese chow mein for $6.25 a dish. I have been here twice, once dining in and once for take-out and am always tempted to order everything. Their chow mein is at the perfect level of crispiness, not drowned out by the sauce and hits the spot. Also have had their eggplant and pork on rice and their sauce goes well with the rice and they are not skimpy on garlic! WOOHOO! Their daily soups remind me of home and are delicious. My friends got the steamed oysters ($4.50/ea) and they looked amazing with sauce and garlic. I am not a big fan of oysters but after seeing theirs, I debated getting one. At the end of our meal, we got a dessert soup of taro and tapioca which was sooo good.

Another amazing thing is that I got take-out and the food was STILL WARM after more than an hour outside in the cold! Gotta love woks and Chinese stoves."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed the king mushrooms and chicken.   The noodles that come with the lobster are soft.   The choices of seafood, and the different sizes give patrons the choice.

The general tsao chicken was tastefully done and included diced tomatoes.   Their specials help to keep the bill down."}
{"text":"Love this place! Old school hole in the wall Chinese food joint. I always order something off the specials written on the wall and I haven't gone wrong yet. The menu is extensive and includes many non-seafood items. They will also change dishes to accommodate dietary restrictions, but be very clear on what you do or do not want. If the razor clams are available, try them with the black beans sauce. And the mussels in red wine are actually cooked in white wine, but they are still fabulous! You have to initiate contact with the staff, they don't watch you to see if you need anything, but they do respond quickly when summoned. Ambience and d√©cor leave a little to be desired, but when you get food this good for this price, who's complaining? Good food, good size portions, and good prices."}
{"text":"Came for lunch around 12:15 and the restaurant was empty. It opens at noon, and already you can see them preparing lots of take-out orders.

Up at the front you can see lots of fish and lobsters in the tanks.
Tables are covered in sheets of white plastic. Haven't seen that for awhile.

We ordered the lunch special. As of Dec 2016, prices are $5.75 for rice dishes, $6.50 for noodle dishes. Apparently some menus are going to be updated tonight...

I've heard about the portion sizes and people are not exaggerating. It's a massive plate that you would normally get in a regular order. It being a lunch special didn't seem to make a difference.

Their chow mein is pretty satisfying. Nice and crispy and not completely drenched in sauce.

Unfortunately, the vermicelli I got was no good. It had a burnt flavor, and I wasn't sure if it was the oil they used or they just burnt the noodles while processing the lunch rush orders. But I'll let that slide since chow mein was good."}
{"text":"I went thinking about the great food in Chinatown but I left with a big deception, I ordered a service of Chicken with sweet and sour sauce, when it arrived the service was with no chicken at all... 

All in the plate was a lot of fat from the chicken we complaint about it and we get no response, bad for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, this is definitely my favourite Chinese restaurant I've tried in the city.  I'm rather picky when it comes to Chinese food, because I grew up in Richmond Hill where I got spoiled by delicious authentic restaurants, then moved to Waterloo for university.  In Kitchener-Waterloo, chicken balls and thick gross sweet and sour sauces rule the Chinese food world.  It was pretty awful.  So now I'm always cautious.  It's hard to know which restaurants are good because of the sheer volume in this area, but Yelp helped me find this one for one of my dining group meetings, and I've been back twice since with different people.  Everyone's been very happy and impressed with their experiences.  

My absolute favourite dish I've had here, that I've had every time and plan to continue ordering, is the squid in black bean sauce with peppers.  Bell peppers are one of the vegetables that I can't stand - but I still love this dish.  The squid is always perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the sauce is fantastic.  I just pick around the peppers and leave them for everyone else!  The joys of family style eating.  

Another favourite dish is the Beef with 3 kinds of Mushrooms - so good and flavourful!  Delicious!  The deep fried quail is fantastic, and of course I always order Chinese Broccoli.  

Some of the dishes that weren't huge hits were the beef brisket dish (too fatty and not enough meat), the pork chow mein (nothing bad, nothing great), the cashew chicken (again nothing bad about it but nothing spectacular).  

It seems that if you go off the beaten track of the well-known Chinese dishes here, you're rewarded - and I like that.  I also love the price.  The first time I went, with four girls stuffed, we each paid about $14 tax and tip included.  The second time was a family visit and I think for 5 people it was about $75 before tax and tip.  The third time I think we each paid $20 because we ordered a more expensive item (fresh fish - worth it!).  You really can't go wrong with such amazing food at such a reasonable price.  

All in all, fantastic food, amazing price - go there!"}
{"text":"Sang Ho has been around for a really long time.  I remember coming here to dine with my Uncle Ming, who introduced me to this fine dining establishment at the tender age of 14.  

Although there are now many other dining establishments available if you want Chinese cuisine closer to home - Sang Ho is worth the idling on the DVP to reach downtown China Town.  Yes - the food here is THAT good.  

I brought a friend on a dining adventure to Sang Ho just to prove that the best Chinese food is NOT in his humble abode of Richmond Hill.  My personal opinion is that all the pretentious, so-called \"fine-dining\" Chinese restaurants are located in \"Rich\"mond Hill.  If you want to get ripped off for mediocre food, then go ahead and eat up there!

I ordered:
Peppered Eggplant & Oysters - served in a sizzling pot with oyster sauce, scallions and ginger.  This is absolutely a divine dish.  And again I have to give kudos to my Uncle Ming for having introduced me to this heavenly dish.  Even fussy kids who don't eat vegetables will love this dish.  The oysters are deep fried, and the flavours of the sauce, scallions and ginger penetrate deeply into the dish to pack it with intense flavour.  If you order nothing else - order this dish!

Beef Brisket Chow Mein - Their beef brisket was not lacking in flavour.  You can tell they definitely pan-fry the beef brisket to seal in the juices and have the beef fuse with the sauce.  My dining companion practically licked the plate clean.  

Shiitake Mushrooms with Pea Shoots - I just can't have dinner sans a vegetable dish so I opted for pea shoots.  Again, it was packed with intense flavours stemming from the mushrooms and oyster sauce combo.

Verdict:

My dining companion is absolutely enamoured by this hidden gem in China Town.  He said he loved all 3 dishes, and the dessert was even more divine.  It was a taro, tapioca, red bean sweet soup.  We finished about 2 bowls each and it took every ounce of self control not to say yes when the server asked if we wanted seconds!  The bill with tax and tip came to under $50 for 2 people, with some leftovers for lunch.  I am kind of glad I live farther away from this restaurant, as if I lived within proximity, I would probably become obese!  

I think the variance in reviews for restaurants rests a lot on menu selection.  Sometimes, not knowing what to order, or ordering the wrong thing is what differentiates a 1 star review vs. a 5 star review.  I hope everyone who reads this review will give Sang Ho a try!"}
{"text":"This is not a 4 star restaurant. Terrible. Where do I begin?
The absolute worst Cantonese Chow Mein I've had in my life. Soggy noodles, really soggy. Very low quality chicken, pork and shrimp, a complete train wreck for a dish. 2 steamed rice that never made it to the table. Sizzling Pepper Beef, big, chewy pieces, WAY too salty sauce. Then a deep fried salt and pepper squid which was nasty, fishy and way too salty.
DON'T DO IT, TRUST ME."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in chinatown!!! the restaurant might look a bit old, but the food is definitely promising. Price is cheaper than other restaurants on spadina, serving is huge and the servers are very friendly. Will def go again"}
{"text":"Went there with friends, wasn't sure what to expect. Seeing tanks of live lobster, shrimp, sea bass, tilapia and other fish by the door was a good sign. Friendly staff, service was quick, friendly. The food was amazing to say the least. They had a deal on lobster, 2 lobsters for 32 bucks, good deal. Waiter recommended satay sauce (spelling?) , my lord, I am in love!!! Ordered a pound of fresh shrimp, outstanding. My first experience there and highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite hongkong style Chinese food in Chinatown. The service was amazing! And ALLL dishes were on point! The food was so good that I only took 3 pictures out of 7 items we ordered. We are from LA California. It surprised us how great the food tastes!!!! The sweet tofu at the end was the best I ever had ever outside of China. The lobster and fish were all super fresh and prices were not over the top. If we ever visit Toronto again, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I read on some blog that this place was spotless. Is there another Sang-Ho restaurant in Toronto, Chinatown?  This place is not spotless, but it is not dirty. The clear plastic on top of the table is a turnoff. The food is okay for Chinatown, but you can get much better Chinese food in the burbs. The dishes come out piping hot,  good flavor. Don't order the roasted squab. It is retried, dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious Lobster special. We ordered fried rice and Pork-chop Sui as well as the Lobster special.  We are looking forward to trying out their other sea food items since they have a good variety of fresh fish in their tanks."}
{"text":"A Chinese restaurant on the North-West bock of Dundas & Spadina, a classic Chinese restaurant complete with plastic table covers!

Yvonne T. with me & family had a reservation, yes this Chinese restaurant surprisingly does this, unheard of amongst Chinese eateries.

Favorite dishes: 

 \"Lobster with green onions\" the lobster was cooked just right, the succulent flavor infused flesh came of out of the shelled sections very easily, something that I find very rare in lobster preparation. Excellent flavor from this lobster dish.

 \"Peppered Eggplant & Oysters\" served in a hot pot, with scallions & ginger with chopped eggplants infused with strong flavor from cooked oysters. All were mixed together with a shallow pool of sauce formed from the cooking process,  it was the ultimate combination of seafood & vegetable.

\"Beef Brisket Rice Noodles\" The sliced beef was pan fried to seal in the flavors & moisture, which resulted in an excellent eating experience. The rice noodles were saturated in the beef sauce, thus were some of the best tasting rice noodles I have ever eaten.


Service was good, additionally the restaurant owner made an appearance, a most enjoyable dining experience, I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in CT for good wholesome Cantonese cuisine that tastes amazing.  However, last night I remembered why I don't go on a busy night, as their service is terrible once they get a full house.  We ordered 5 dishes that each came out about 15 mins apart.  It made the meal less enjoyable as we were forced to eat one dish at a time vs. having all our items at once.

The food tasted amazing though.  Their grouper fish hot pot, black pepper egg plant hot pot and steamed oysters in black bean sauce were amazing.  My friends wanted fired oysters and the duck stuffed with taro (not my choices as they don't sound that appealing to me).  

I would not recommend the duck dish - it was a plate of overly greasy mush that was way too much taro and too little duck. The fired oysters was just that - very plain and lacked any flavour - stick with the steam oysters in black bean sauce."}
{"text":"It isn't the fanciest looking joint by any stretch (think very basic decor, dated furniture and drab walls), but the food is surprisingly decent and very tasty - an example of the age-old adage that you shouldn't judge a book by its very dated cover!

We visited as a group of about 20 people on a Friday evening, and we ordered a variety of items - various meats, stewed tofu, grilled fish, fried eggplant, noodles, among many other items. The tofu and the fish were delicious, but all the dishes were actually quite tasty, full of flavour, and not to heavy. Portion size was more than decent, and overall, we were happy with the dishes we were served.

Conclusions: the food is tasty, and it's a decent spot to grab a casual meal - but if you're looking for an environment that's a bit more modern and hip (i.e. for a date or a special occasion), look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd give a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown 5 stars.  No, I'm not a snob, I've just eaten in way too many Chinese restaurants in my life that my expectations have been beaten down to a stump.

My husband and I were just being tourists around town when a sign that read \"2 Lobsters for $25.95\" caught our attention.  Well, it's 5:00PM and close enough to dinner time anyway, so why not?!  We walked in and there was only 1 other table in the whole restaurant.  Was that a bad sign?  Quickly, check the Yelp app for Sang-Ho!!  Ratings from other Yelpers seem to think this joint was pretty good.  We're satisfied.

We ordered 4 lobsters right away.  Our request is for the first 2 to be steamed with some ginger and garlic.  The other 2 to be pan fried in ginger and green onions.  We also ordered 2 squabs with our dinner.  The staff were shocked that we had ordered that much food, but we assured them with our enthusiastic smiles.  Plus, we weren't sitting right by the exit so it didn't look like we were going to dine and dash.

The owner decided to give us some free Chinese broth and that was a nice gesture.  Our main dishes came afterwards and we devoured it like it was nobody's business.  The lobster meat was succulent and sweet.  Squabs were juicy and the skin were crispy.  We didn't leave anything to waste, just like my mother always told me, \"Wasting food is a crime!\"  They even gave us complimentary dessert \"Tong Sui\", which is a dessert soup with rock sugar, red bean and sometimes taro. 

After our feast, I had to use the washroom and having been to numerous Chinese restaurants in my childhood life, I was nervous about what condition I would find it.  Surprisingly, it was clean.  I didn't have to hold my up pant legs or my breath. 

When we finally settled the bill, I noticed that they also take credit card.  Another point to you Sang-Ho Seafood Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese restaurant at Chinatown, good portion size and the food was tasty.

We made reservation ahead of time for a table for 10 for Friday dinner, but it turned out the reservation wasn't needed, because the restaurant was only half filled. Compared to the other Chinese seafood restaurants nearby, Sang Ho isn't as popular.

We really wanted Lobsters, but the 3 dishes party combo was $75 and the Double Lobster dish itself was $44. We ended up picking one dish per person to share, along with the Lobster dish. 

The food came rather quickly, but they messed up our order a few times, such as giving us the wrong dish or completely missing dishes. The meal came with complementary house soup and dessert, much like the other restaurants nearby. I really liked their Sweet Ribs, Deep fried duck with taro, and of course, the Lobsters.

The service was pretty much what you would expect from around here...grumpy middle aged Chinese people, but will respond to you most of the times. I was annoyed of how long it took them to get our bills though because it was during their break time and apparently no one wanted to get up to do their job. Debit and credit is accepted over $20.

Overall, I think the place is decent, not too pricey, as it ended up being $26 after tax and tips for us. Though I think the place is subpar compared to the other Seafood places nearby, both in terms of prices, quantity, and quality"}
{"text":"Found this place because we were trying to find a place that did the garlic and green onion Chinese style lobster. This place looks like it might have been nice at one point, but is super run down and old looking. That being said, the food was delicious and service was kind. 

We ordered the lobster, black bean mussels, some kind of beef shortribs in sweet sauce, eggplant with minced pork, general tsao chicken and king oyster mushrooms with veggies. Everything was delicious and I would recommend them all! All the food was fresh, well cooked (this is important because overdone seafood is the worst), and super flavourful! It was a real throwback to Chinese meals of my childhood as they had the free soup that they brought out at the beginning (a taro, beef and carrot consomme), and then the free dessert of soft tofu with syrup (which is 1000000 times better than the red/green bean desserts that I am none too fond of). 

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in chinatown for over 10 years, it still the same fish tanks and packed white plastic table tops. The food here is pretty consistent, both seafood and meats are cooked well."}
{"text":"Got conned by ordering some sort of special steamed fish at the waiter's recommendation. Had a party of two. Ordered only two items -- fried oysters, and a steamed fish. Bill came out to like 60 bucks.

Apparently I got charged like 25 bucks per pounds for a fish the server told me was like 18 per pound. I had asked for a small fish since there were only two of us. The fish was not even that good -- it was nothing special, and I'm pretty sure I could have made an equivalent tasting steamed fish with ginger and soy sauce. 

This rating is only for my experience here -- I've heard good things about them having good combo meals. I really wanted to try the lobster deal they had the second time I was around here, but my first experience made me too hesitant."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went here a while ago so we can try their lobster. 

The place is quite spacious and quiet. There was a family a few table but minimal nose. The waiter was very nice and helped offer some suggestions. We ended up with the lobster dish, fried rice, a noodles dish, some shrimp and an assortment of seafood. 
Let's just say we ordered more then we can handle. The price wasn't too expensive either.  Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be a go-to for late night after clubbing because they open late and you don't always want pho. 

But food isn't always spectacular here. They have specials with a set number of dishes and are quite reasonably priced. I have discovered recently however that their fried oysters are quite good and because Chinatown isn't the greatest for dine in, I usually order take out from here."}
{"text":"Eggplant. Oysters. Two of my favorite things (especially with pepper sauce!), so I was excited to see this called out over the menu highlights here. Sadly, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed when I started eating. My (to-go) order was slightly overcooked, impacting the oysters, and yet some of the pieces of eggplant were undercooked, for a total of ~$16. Maybe this would have been better had I gotten another dish for variety."}
{"text":"There is some mystery here.... lobster  was almost served cold ,  although tasted ok. Rice and shrimps was overcooked. Soup was not fabulous. There are better deal combos for lobsters around....  and better food.
Perhaps that was a bad day with an interim in the kitchen,  based on other reviews...."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The service is fantastic. The food is tasty. Portions huge. The price is not bad. Can't go wrong. 

What i've tried:

Double onion lobster: really good. It's expected. 

Fried Eggplant and pork. Its so good and oily. The flavour is powerful.  Huge portion.

Cantonese chow mein: this was not bad. Crispy and tasty.

Seafood fried rice: really good. Not greasy and huge portions.

Chinese greens and seafood: this was tasty but the squid was so chewy. The greens tasted good.

Overall a good experience. Would come back for lobster."}
{"text":"I had one of my most fun, memorable meals here! I tried jellyfish, a big clam, smoked chicken, spare ribs, pork/tofu soup and more. What made the meal so special was meeting some regular customers that guided me through the menu and gave me some tips!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little boy with my Chinese family. It pretty much spiked my tongue to intense flavours, before I started visiting hoity toity restaurants and eating tartare, terrines, and pate.

The quality is very VERY good here and the lady who's been serving me all these years is always friendly. Warning though. there are no pictures on their menus, but it's a good thing. This place is just THAT good. 

I like how you still get complimentary soup and dessert after all these years. Note the prices are still good, so don't worry if you aren't interested in the freebies.

I almost always get yang chow fried rice here, it's my favourite in the city without being too oily or salty. 

I also enjoy:
-crab claws: are nicely warm moist and chewy inside the light crisp covering. 
-seafood in taro bird nest looks wonderful and has some nice big shrimp. 
-sweet and sour pork
-lobster (better to order when visiting with a group)
-deep fried shrimp balls: similar to the crab claw, so opt for that if on a budget.
-sautee beef in hot pot
-deep fried soft shell crab...oh yeah baby
-julienne beef (so tasty, served on little light crunchy noodles and topped with a rainbow medley of peppers and veggies
-mapo tofu (choose medium spice for good balance of flavour)
-steamed fish or chicken with ginger and scallion sauce, ooh so basic and yummy
-crispy fried chicken, the skin is slick shiny and smooth, thin, and crunchy
.....
- there is also a special fried rice for $17 which is pretty much a secret menu offering of a fried rice jacked up with fine seafood."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in downtown chinatown. There is always a line here and the seafood is fresh from the tank. You can ask them to allow you to choose your seafood from the tank if you like.

Lobster here is especially nice and many of their other dishes. Pricing here is really good especially considering seafood is generally expensive."}
{"text":"It was late in the evening and we were looking for great victory meal after packing up at the end of an event. Checking on Yelp, we found Sang-Ho and gave them a call to ask if they were still open. The answer was a helpful \"Yes, and we'll wait for you\" Despite coming in past 11pm, at no time did we feel that we were rushed to finish our meal.

When we got there, they were finishing off a large party and having pictures taken. It was the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and it also happened to be the server's father's birthday celebration. So, we joined in with singing \"Happy Birthday\" to the grand old man.

On the chalk board, they had a \"2 lobster for $29.95\" special. When we tried to order that, the server suggested instead that we take the large one they had at the same price. Fishing it out of the tank, the lobster looked HUGE! I was afraid it would be old and tough, but she guaranteed that it would be better. And it was. The meat was sweet, succulent, and tender. Fried with ginger and scallions, it had the 5 of us smacking our lips and licking on our fingers.

We also had a steamed freshly live fish, beef hot plate, conch fried with lotus buds and assorted veggies, green pea shoots fried with garlic and vegetarian fried noodles. Every dish was perfectly prepared, no MSG, and not too salty. We ended up with a complementary sweet bean-curd dessert."}
