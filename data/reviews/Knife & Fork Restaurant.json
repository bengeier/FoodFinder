{"text":"Best breakfast you can have in Monroe. Delicious and generous portions. The chicken fingers with the home made ranch dressing are phenomenal. Southern comfort food. I always stop by to eat there when Im in the area."}
{"text":"i had the fried porkchops and gave me a terrible stomache which lasted me all day long, the decor its awful, this place is stuck back in time, they have plastic plants hanging from the ceiling and you can tell they have never been dusted.. will never go back for sure. hot mess"}
{"text":"Very unwelcoming and unaccommodating. I went there with my boyfriend who is African American (I am white) and the entire place got quiet and stared. We felt very judged and unwelcome. Our waitress never greeted us and seemed to be ignoring us from the moment we walked in. When we asked to substitute bacon for hashbrowns, she immediately said, \"no, we can't do that.\" when we explained that we were vegetarians and would end up wasting the meat, she just said she couldn't do that and we would have to buy the platter and the hashbrowns separately, which made no sense at all. It would have been $8 for 2 pancakes and a hashbrown. Anyway, we ended up leaving. I said thank you when I walked out, and she didn't say anything back. I'll never go back there again or recommend this place to anyone. I hate to say it but the discrimination was evident."}
{"text":"It was a solid american style diner. The food was cheap and portions were large. Nothing exotic just solid. They do allow smoking inside however which is not a plus for the non-smokers out there."}
{"text":"Great little diner that serves breakfast all day. Prices are super reasonable! Came on a Saturday morning and the place is packed! Service was great and food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"Not nearly dank enough. Not nearly as filthy as hyped. Definitely a letdown on the presentation department.

The food and service was banging, though."}
{"text":"We were traveling from Charlotte to Oak Island and came on this restaurant for breakfast.  It is fantastic!!!  Great breakfast and so afforable!  Huge breakfast and great waitresses!  Very friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm terribly and disappointed to say but today was the worst experience  we've had out of being faithful weekly customers for 25 years plus :( My entire family eats here and have many many years .Today the spaghetti was sour  and it always tastes like cinnamon for some odd reason :(   told  our waitress that i would just pay for salad and bread ,but what i didn't know id be paying $10.00 for that!No meal ,they charged us $20.00 ,was $28.00 for my mothers meal and my three bites of salad!OMG that is horrific esp when your not that rich.They charge you extra to take 2 little cups of Ranch dressing home so ,I got two $1.50 ...that's sad they cant afford to give their paying customers  who order salads  any dressing!But to be forced to pay $20.00 when it would have been $28.00 for two people is insane!Its ridiculous !They marked the spaghetti off ,I could have gotten a steak alot cheaper!Or all you can eat!And honestly DO NOT EVEN THINK OF USING THE RESTROOM AFTER!I'm honest  to god shocked and surprised they are NOT out of business!Its pure septic tank inside the ladies,Not sure about the men's?????I actually witnessed ladies leaving  holding their noises and  warning us what awaits .But like i said we are FAITHFUL FAITHFUL CUSTOMERS 28 years plus no matter how dirty and sorry they treat us and they do each and every-time .There's one really nice waitress but today when she charged me $10.00 for my three bites of salad it truly left a bad disgusting taste in my mouth :("}
{"text":"I have to say if your going to rate this place solely on decor, and clenliness, it's a minus stars and that is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. Normally my husband and I go to waffle house and then when we get shitti service and our order is jacked we point at knife and fork and say we gotta go there and try it out.   We'll this time we did, as I lead this with the place is divey but when I tell you I had what may have been the best tasting omlette I've had in over a decade and possibly my life I'm being dead serious. Let's forget I slipped on that half eaten hot dog that was under my table and focus on how awesome the food was....the omelets ingredients were evenly distributed, the orders were correct,  quick, delicious, curteous service and cheaper than waffle house with bigger portions.  Hubs and I will definitely,  be regulars here."}
{"text":"Many years ago this used to be the best place for BBQ.  It changed owners and became the Knife & Fork.  I have often wondered if it was connected to the old Knife & Fork in Charlotte.  

I refuse to visit here ever again. It truly has the same booths and decor of the old BBQ.  Any time there is a lot of rain, wind, etc. in the area I look for a story on the news that the building fell down.  From the time I walk through the door until I walk back out I feel a strong urge to go home and take a shower.  It feels that dirty and grimy to me.  The food is so so.  I have had better at other local restaurants.  

This is one of those places I say eat at your own risk, buyer beware, etc. Although I've not used them I can only imagine that the restrooms aren't any better."}
{"text":"This is an older restaurant but the breakfast is great!  Quick service, great prices   I recommend this restaurant to all."}
{"text":"I have eaten here off and on for the past 30 years. What has changed???? I don't know. Good generic food. The restaurant is old, out dated, and dirty looking.
I only go back after several months away, just to see if anything has changed. NOPE!"}
{"text":"Good quality home cookin' comfort food at its best!!  There seems to be a carbon copy of this sort of place all over, but this is the real McCoy!  You could not ask for better, faster, or friendlier service; and the food is just amazing.  Definately a must-do in Union County....."}
{"text":"Just because food is cheap doesn't mean it's good.  I like local family owned restaurants, they are my favorite, especially for breakfast food.  I didn't have a good experience here though.  The silverware was very dirty for myself and wife, and so were the cups.  I had a bacon and cheese omelette; it was over done, small and bland..  the sausage links were good and the grits were alright.  The gravy for the biscuits was kind of odd and fake tasting.  I don't think I will go here again.  Our server had food from the plates she carried all over her stomach and it was touching our plates as well when it arrived.  My wife thinks this place is disgusting and dirty.  I don't always mind a greasy spoon or hole in the wall, but I have to say, it did distract my experience."}
{"text":"Probably the best grits I have had in Charlotte!  This place will be packed and it is a little scary and dirty looking but just go with it.  All of the local yocals come here for their breakfast grub.  The prices are cheap and the coffee is divine.  I normally hate all breakfast food but there is something different about this place that you will never be able to duplicate.  Any idiot can make scrambled eggs but having them here is like you have never had them before.  Not kidding.  I also love that they let you order a BLT in the morning!  Thank you little diner!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly not bad. I'm originally from Monroe & always saw the restaurant but never dined in. I'm pleasantly surprised. Despite the less than attractive building, the restaurant was clean. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating. I ordered the grilled chicken, hash browns, eggs, & grits. I wasn't a fan of the chicken, there was some weird seasoning (I think Italian dressing... Barf). The hash browns, eggs, & grits were delicious. I'll def go back."}
{"text":"A staple of Monroe and one of my favorite stops when headed out of town and towards Myrtle Beach, SC.  This place has been around forever and I swear the food is just great probably b/c the grill they use has years of flavor infused into it.  I've had a few lunches here but really it's the breakfast that brings me out.  Cheap too, $5.85 will buy you 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, hash browns or grits and bacon and sausage!  Not too shabby!  Portions are very big and doubtful you'll walk away hungry.  

Service is always friendly and quick.  Southern hospitality at its best."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Waitresses are awesome, breakfast is perfect and great prices!  The only drawback is the ambiance.  Old and very dated but IS clean and that is what matters!"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the 1960s exterior of retro interior. This is not contemporary decor but seems clean.  Has a large selection on the menu. I ordered the hot Italian sub with onion rings. Hubby got the roast beef sub with fries. Fries were really good. Subs were okay. I'd try something else next time, but I will be back.  Generous portions.  Kind servers."}
{"text":"I love the Knife and Fork. They have a very wide menu with low prices. I have never ordered something I did not like!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but we can't do it!
If you have ever been inside a house that previously had a roach infestation you know there is a certain smell, this place has that smell! Eeeew! Gross!
I hate that I can't get past having the knowledge of what that smell means, because the food is really great!
I love the Country Style Steak (best in town!), the banana pudding and the squash (no pun intended).
Last time we were there there was a freshly squished roach on the seat of my booth!
We haven't been back!"}
{"text":"It eats like it looks and sounds, We went there for breakfast and that would probably be the only thing we go there for.

It is a diner type place that hasn't been updated since it opened is my guess.  If you are looking for breakfast okay...otherwise there are better places close by."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST for BREAKFAST! Almost as good as breakfast for lunch but pretty distantly back from breakfast for dinner, aka \"brinner\".

This is a short order sort of restaurant. Maybe not as short as the one in My Cousin Vinny, but short. Two pages of eggs, waffles and such. Keep It Simple and Short.

I went with the two eggs (over medium) with corned beef hash, grits (based on Melissa's recommendation) and toast. And coffee.

Coffee comes in a large mug, which is awesome. While the gals did come around with refills often enough, it's nice to have your coffee fixed just the way you like it for more than two sips before the cup is empty. And it's decent coffee. Not that fancy caramel macchiato latte half caf stuff. This is coffee, nice and simple.

Breakfast arrived on three plates. Eggs and grits on one, corned beef hash on the next and the toast on the third. Nice big eggs and the portions of grits and hash were excellent. As for the flavor, all were really good. The grits were maybe a little salty, but it's hard to match everyone's taste. The hash was plenty meaty and the eggs arrived just as I had ordered them. A good value of fat and carbs and protein for $5.10.

With the coffee and a tip, it was rounded off to $10. Good deal. I like this place."}
{"text":"A great place to stop for lunch enroute to the beach.
You get great family style country cooking in a diner style atmosphere.

I had the grilled chicken tenders with okra & cole slaw.
Mom had  the vegetable plate, in addition to the above, you get a choice of potato salad, green beans and fried squash."}
