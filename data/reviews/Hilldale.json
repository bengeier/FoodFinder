{"text":"So disappointed with the changes at Hilldale.  Why would you want to make a mall outside in Madison WI? I used to love being able to browse in small shops without worrying about the weather. Sadly, many of the small shops that I enjoyed have moved or gone out of business.   It feels like a ghost town now."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the snazzy website.  This shouldn't count as a mall.  They have a few good stores (North Face, Anthropologie, L'Occitane and Macy's) but its very very slim pickings."}
{"text":"When ordering take out, wait time extends double time from what your told; and yet once you arrive to pick up your order, 80% of the time you must wait additional time to get your food.  #takestoolong #rathereatatred"}
{"text":"Well I went to take my daughter to see Santa today and see the remodels.....as another reviewer said. Why would you build a mostly outdoor mall in Wisconsin? It's cold here. While we were there we wanted to stay indoors, again, because it's cold, and look at stores while staying warm. Unfortunately most of the indoor  stores are now gone. So we spent most of our time in Macys. I did check out Ever eve as I usually do but wasn't going to window shop or take a jaunt to stores away from ever eve, again, because it's cold. I just don't know if this was a good move for Hilldale. I know I wont go there in the winter months anymore unless I have a specific destination because, it's cold outside. I really like some of the stores that are still there so I gave Hilldale more than one star. I don't know what if any new ones I might like because I didn't venture out from ever eve, maybe because it's cold outside. Also I probably won't anytime soon, because it's winter, and it's cold. Who wants to be all freezing cold going from store to store. Plus then you can't keep your coat off. You have to keep putting it back on and then take it off again if you want to try anything on. I'm not sure how other parents will feel but again the cold temperatures might make it hard to relax and go from store to store with kids. Although... shopping with kids and the word relax don't usually go together. I hope Hilldale does well but this remodel just doesn't make sense to me. Maybe I'm wrong."}
{"text":"So glad this place exists and is very close to my place! Great restaurants, nice ambience and some good stores for shopping. BCBG has a little section in Macy's and thats my favorite place to shop.   All the restaurants are good. My favorites are sushi Muramuto, Flemings and Pasquals. You can try a new restaurant every time!   Sundance movie theatre is also very nice. They have unique movies.  Its nice to have Metcalf and Target in there to get groceries and other essentials. So its really a multi-purpose shopping center. You can dress up and go for a date night in one of the nice restaurants or you can dress down and just go get your groceries."}
{"text":"I enjoy this mall very much! It has increased in what I like to call \"class\" from past years. They have added some nicer shops and it is no longer the \"Senior Sweet Spot.\" Yes, it used to have a high population of older people but that's not bad. It is hard to find a few good shops here but it isn't that bad. It has a nice leisure type feel to it, in the sense that you go and just stroll past a few good shops. They also have some great restaurants nearby such as the Flat-Top Grill and a Great Dane location. They also have the renowned Sun Dance Theater with a lot of great abstract movies there (some very left-wing political movies in my opinion). All-in-All I think it is a nice establishment that has some great potential to become even better!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a nice and clean place this is! They had the Farmer's market going on when I was here. There not a ton of stores inside but they had some interesting shops in here. I just wish there were more stores in here but the strip makes up for it. It's really nice. Macy's is here which I'm not a big fan of, they had Sundance here which I've never been to but want to go. They have a store in here for kids, it looked like an educational store but I didn't go inside. I was really strolling through the place to see what was new and what changed. I wish they didn't close off the opening to Metcalfe's because that was really inconvenient to walk outside just to get there. Anyway, if I had more time, I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good selection of stores and restaurants.  However it is not an indoor mall - so unless you are dressed for it in the winter, not a walking / window shopping experience for the unprepared."}
{"text":"Hilldale is undergoing some changes that seem to be for the better.  Before the renovations, it seemed very dead except during the holidays.  The new stores seem to be bringing in more people.  I'm sure the senior mall walkers will be upset at losing their winter walking space.    I hope that Hilldale continues to get the same quality of stores and restaurants that have came in during phase 2 of their redevelopment."}
{"text":"I am sick about the changes pegged for Hilldale. This little classy shopping experience is coming to an end. I love walking indoors, especially in the winter. The little locally owned shops are leaving probably to be replaced by the same old chain stores. Rupert's and Therese Zach have already announced their departures. May they succeed in their new homes. Sundance is the anchor. I hope they will retain their current ambience. I am not alone in my mourning."}
{"text":"If you're going for something specific it's great. However, this isn't the sort of mall you go to wander through. It's got all sorts of stores and is vastly better than it used to be since it added on the 2nd row of shops and theatre and such a few years back."}
{"text":"When a development company came in and decided to revamp Hilldale, some in the neighborhood where I live were concerned. We have senior citizens that live in the immediate area and they were not at all happy that Hildale was going to be an open air mall, as many seniors got their walk in during the winter months sheltered from the elements at Hilldale. To reassure the nearby residents, a meeting was set up with the neighborhood association to calm fears about the renovations. Obviously, any objections the seniors at the meeting had were not taken seriously, since the developer went ahead & did it they way they planned it.  One point that was made in conjunction with the open areas of mall during the meeting was the wonderful outdoor common area, supplied with tables, chairs, and benches, where visitors to the mall could have smoothies and converse. I wouldn't have remembered that particular point if it had not been made over and over again.  Fast forward to half the mall being open to the outside. Yes, it has delightful seasonal decorations during the different holidays & yes, there are the aforementioned tables and benches. What the developer didn't mention was the speakers placed up high on the outsides of the stores that blares music very loudly all day and night. There is no sitting and conversing unless you want to shout at each other. It can give you a headache. It is strictly a place of business and the mall doesn't give a shit about fitting in with rest of the neighborhood. They want moneyed shoppers to visit their stores, eat in their restaurants and go home.  The rest of the charms of this mall are few and far between. Sure if you enjoy shopping at high-end chain stores, you will be very happy here. There is a Target, a pricey grocery store and now a AMC movie theater that took over from the Sundance Cinema.  Call me a burned out neighborhood resident if you like, but if I'm going to recommend a mall to an out-of-towner, I tell them to got the Greenway Station."}
{"text":"Today I decided to check out the destruction of what used to be one of favorite places to shop, Hilldale.  But things have gotten much worse.  I now see that the only places left inside the actual mall are Macy's-yuck, ULLA Eyeware, Sundance Cinema-why would you want to go see unknown movies, and University Book Store-it is starting to loose it's charm.  Cornblooms is now gone.  So sad it used to have the most unique shoes.  Dumpling Haus is there and my wife and I have dined there but we're not impressed.  Overall, this mall is catering to women and the only place that men can shop is Macy's but why bother.??  I can get better quality clothing at Walmart and it's better quality and a whole lot cheaper.  Pretty soon the original Hilldale will be nothing but a distant memory!"}
{"text":"This review really bums me out.  I really wanted to love Hilldale and the concept behind Hilldale (upscale shopping in Madison).  The unfortunate truth is that its a broken business model in today's market in Wisconsin.  This review only deals with the internal portion of Hilldale -- the outlying shops are great!  Over the past year, many stores have closed up shop or \"retired\" (Jan Byce, Hong Kong Cafe and .  The internal portion of the mall is nearly a ghost town -- I thought I saw a dust ball last week.  The only places worth going to inside the mall are: the shoe stores (New Balance and Morgans), Sundance Cinemas, Macy's and Metcalfe's (especially).  Walking inside to get to those places you'll be greeted with many empty store rooms - it's really depressing.  It's only a matter of time before everything goes besides Macy's (since they own the mall and resultedly stuck).    On 08/20/13, WS Development from Massachusetts announced that they will be making the internal part of the mall open air by Fall 2014.  Effin' really -- it may be fine for six months, but we have winter here, it gets really cold, snowy and very slippery.  Many of the customers are older people.  There appears to include no tarp or anything -- just blasting Mr. Freeze.  The Fall 2014 opening is idiotic - just in time for Jack Frost??   Even though West Towne Mall is mediocre (reviewing coming soon), people are just going to drive on past this mall once it gets chilly.  I live practically across the street and I will!  My suggestion is to model it after the fictional Hill Valley Mall and showcase a DeLorean with a flux capacitor near the entrance. :/"}
{"text":"I'll use this example of something I experienced last night to sum up my feeling on Hilldale.  My husband and I chose the wrong night to see a movie, the day after Christmas, so we decided to take a walk through Hilldale to kill time before our show. A gentleman in a Lamborghini is trying to find parking, and my husband jokes he must be looking for special rich man Lamborghini parking.  He then parks in a \"Expecting Mothers Only\" spot.   I can't make this up if I tried.  Now how does this relate to my overall experiences at Hilldale?  Snooty, \"upper class\" patrons who shop at overpriced clothing stores like LuluLemon and Anthropology pretty much sums up my experiences.   So many a time I have come here to see a movie at Sundance, and I'm disgusted by attitudes of my fellow patrons, and the lack of stores that any normal person can actually afford. Am I faulting people for being well off and having disposable incomes? No, but I am saying that unless you have a disposable budget where prices don't matter, this shopping center is probably not for you."}
{"text":"I really like Hilldale.  They have great restaurants (Hong Kong Wok, Great Dane Pub), the Sundance Theater with treasures of indie films, and a great cafe attached to the theater with oversized leather couches for lounging.    I love their Northface store, and Macy's is my go-to for makeup.  Mostly I go to Hilldale with a task in mind.  It's not really the place to go wander around because there is not a huge selection like a traditional mall, but if I need winter apparel, or have a certain food craving, want to watch a movie not in the other theaters, or stop at the Target/Sentry/Macy's - well, this is certainly the place to go.    Nice, upscale shopping center."}
{"text":"I love their renovation- it was about time. During the last years this place experienced a lot of changes, turn over of shops, restaurants, etc. Especially in the inside of the mall. Now the attraction is that this mall is an outside mall, with hipster restaurants, coffee shops, and other things that invites you to spend time. And of last week it hosts the only Apple store in town. I love Sundace, it is one of my favorite, so having this place renovated is another plus. Make sure to take time and discover all new places."}
{"text":"The outdoor shops are better than the indoor shops. I went to the grocery store and didn't realize half the mall was under construction and got nervous. The movie theaters appeared nice but it's probably better to go to a different mall."}
{"text":"Hilldale Shopping Center is not a place I frequent, even when I'm visiting Madison. Madison has some really great, local shops in different parts of the city and it's fun to stroll, but Hilldale is not one of them.   It's not a place I would go to shop, unless it's for one or two specific things; there aren't a ton of stores. It seems very convenient for this part of the city, especially if you live in Shorewood Hills. It's anchored by Macy's and Target, but most of the shops here are a bit more upscale. There's an Anthropologie, Lululemon, l'Occitane en Provence, The Northface and Pendleton. There's also a Fleming's Steakhouse. Twigs, a very upscale, local, women's clothing shop, just opened a location here.   Hilldale is essentially a yuppie shopping center, that's perfect for Madison's upper crust  families to do their average, day to day shopping for the \"common\" things. A day spa for children just opened here. Very exciting!  I do not live in Madison, but I believe I can attest to the convenient location and nice assortment of restaurants. And Hilldale might signify yuppy Madison, but it gets a couple of stars because it has Sundance 608, which was the first Sundance Cinema in the country. It plays big budget movies, but also great documentaries and foreign films. Pretty cool, definitely not your average move theatre in an average shopping center."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison basically my whole life, and it's amazing how Hilldale has changed in 23 years. I remember coming here as a child and getting chocolate shoppe ice cream. Then my mom and I would walk to Morgans or Stride Ride to get new shoes my my chubby, wide, little feet.   To begin with, I still love the fact they have New Balance, Stride Ride, Macy's, Morgans, and University bookstore here. It reminds me of being a child and coming here with my parents. But on a plus side, I adore the new stores that they added to Hilldale. I love the fact that there is a nice nail salon and a few high end stores like Free People, Micheal Kors, The North Face, and Lululemon.   In addition, they have a great variety of places to eat. Most of them are sit down restaurant, which are perfect if you're going to a movie or just got out of one. They have Sushi Muramato, Cafe Porta Alba, Cafe Hollander, and Pascals. They also have a few other places on top of that!  The only downfall is that the parking lot can get very crowded on the weekends and the evenings."}
{"text":"Nice shopping, some great local stores/restaurants hidden among the chains."}
{"text":"Hilldale houses some decent stores but the inside is like an airport and a lot of the retail spaces are empty. I was there on a Saturday but surprisingly  There is an attached gourmet supermarket and nearby Target. Sundance cinema is also a part of the shopping center which apparently features a few big name movies but mostly indie films. They have a neat bar offering coffee/sandwiches/wine/beer all to be enjoyed outside in the lounge area featuring really lovely leather couches and rustic wooden tables. If you are there to enjoy a movie you can take the food and drink inside the theater."}
{"text":"Many of the stores are a bit expensive but it's a lovely mall and very clean. It consists of both an indoor section with a movie theater, Macy's, and many smaller shops and boutiques. There's a strip outside with lots of restaurants, an aveda salon, and other stores. The front parking spots are sometimes hard to find, but there's always spots in the garage."}
{"text":"Hilldale has gotten a lot nicer in the past 2 years. They have added a few more restaurants and stores. This is a more upscale shopping center with a Lululemon, Northface, Kate Spade, and Madewell. The Macy's is nice, but small. There is a MAC counter inside the Macy's. I always enjoy going to the bookstore for badger gear. If you are a budget shopper this may not be the shopping now center for you."}
