{"text":"Another hidden gem in the south hills. It's been here for 2 years and we just discovered it last night. We love Thai food, and always judge a Thai restaurant based on their Tom kha soup, Red or green curry and Pad Thai. That's exactly what we picked for take out from Swasadee thai kitchen. Everything was excellent, especially the Country Pad Thai. The staff was very friendly too. I think we are going to start doing Thai Thursday like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory!"}
{"text":"Wow what a hidden gem!  The food here is great if you don't mind take out.  Saves you a trip thru the tunnel if you have a craving for Thai but don't want to schlep anywhere.  It's a bit pricey but worth it as the taste is superb.  Grown ups had Country Pad Thai with shrimp and Green curry; 10 year old had Indonesian fried rice.   All delicious with plenty left over for several meals.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai around. The portion sizes are huge. The chicken Pad Thai fed my wife and I easily."}
{"text":"Pretty solid.  The delivery is much appreciated.  I've always said the one thing the south hills is lacking is a delivery Thai place.  Had the \"crazy noodles\" aka drunken noodles.  Good spice level and the portion was huge.  Very tasty and lots of veggies.  Also the spring rolls were good.  The plum sauce they comes with always makes it for me.  I'm sure I'll be ordering here again soon!"}
{"text":"I have ordered a couple of times from this restaurant recently. With the change in ownership or management it seems that most dishes are on the sweet side, bland or lack of body including spicy fried rice, red curry, glass noodles, etc.  I think there are better options."}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order while at my daughters dance class. Food was ready on time an fresh an very very tasteful. I would def place a future order."}
{"text":"I ordered Country pad thai and green curry for delivered. .....food came on time and very delicious"}
{"text":"Large servings.  Really nice counter staff and service. The Panang curry was delicious.  The shrimp curry was not as good, but it was OK.  The Tom Yum soup wasn't good; we threw it away.  I'd try this restaurant again until I find the menu items I like best."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai!  We have been waiting for this in the far South Hills.  We had  crazy noodles and basil fried rice.  Spiced perfectly and to our requested heat level.  The chicken was very tasty and moist.  The seating area has only a few tables, so takeout or delivery is the way to go.  The entrees seem to be a bit overpriced - probably due to lack of competition."}
{"text":"Somebody forgot the spices in my Indonesian Fried Rice. Very very plain and bland. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! It could use a larger dining space, but the food is excellent. Everything we have ever tried from curry to pad Thai have been fresh, tasty, and authentic. The service is great despite being as small as it is. They are always friendly and happy to serve us. We will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  They are fast on their orders and the food is pretty great.  I have been trying things all over the menu and everything makes me so happy.  Tom Kha soup is spectacular.  Oh, and DEFINITELY get at least one order of mango sticky rice for dessert.  You're welcome.  Oh, and the dude that works the register is really nice and funny.  Reminds me of Andy from Parks and Rec."}
{"text":"Just order lunch, was reeeeally hungry so I am probably being generous here. The summer rolls were pretty good, the lunch pad thai is probably the worse pad thai I've ever paid money for. Very oily, actually the oil is the only thing that gives this thing taste."}
{"text":"We order from here ALL the time, and their delivery is always incredibly fast and friendly (even during peak dining times).  I've ordered a lot of their food (full disclosure - I always order my curry, stir fry, soup and noodles with tofu, but my family really likes their chicken, pork and shrimp too), and I've enjoyed them all.  Their vegetables are fresh and generously portioned.  Their service is great if you eat in, too.  The mango and avocado curry are both really tasty.  Some of their dishes do tend to run on the spicy side, (and I say this as a person who likes spicy food!) so you might want to order them a little lower on the scale if you don't love spicy food."}
{"text":"Fast service and very nice employees/owner/manager.  I ordered the Pad See Eew--a sweeter noodle dish--for my husband, which was delicious.  I ordered the Chicken Pad Ka Prow, medium spiciness since I love spicy food.  Maybe I'm getting soft, but it was pretty spicy, so much so it was difficult to enjoy.  So I'd recommend estimate for under-spice and go from there!  We'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The food hear is definitely the best Thai in the South Hills by far. Servings are perfectly portioned and there's always extra for leftovers. We had been ordering delivery there weekly when we first moved into the area (over a year), but had one terrible experience with delivery that I haven't gone back in months. The driver took 2 hours to bring our food (needless to say it was cold when it arrived) and upon his arrival he told us that we couldn't order delivery there anymore as we were outside of their service area. We are less than 5 miles away from their location, so this was pretty hard to believe. Between the 2 hour wait and the rudeness of the driver, (not to mention they were keeping some delicious Crazy Noodles away from a 9-month pregnant woman) it will take some time before we order there again."}
{"text":"Great, spicy Thai food.  So much better than the outside would lead you to believe.  The only thing missing from their menu is a green papaya salad.  Everything else has been phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place..the first Thai Resturant  in Mt. Lebanon! The food in my opinion is adequate, ok. And if I didn't have any other choices, would be a go to. The appetizers I ordered were just ok. Only stand out was the tofu triangles. Very tasty with a great sauce. The same sauce in different variations was served with spring rolls and wings. Neither of which were notable. Had the crazy noodles with beef, spicy... excellent! Could eat this every day. Mango with coconut rice, very yummy. Overall, I think they are trying to incorporate Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai in the menu and failing. There are wonderful restaurants within a stones throw that deliver better renditions. Stick to Thai. I can only assume that the EXCELLENT reviews here are from individuals who have never had real Thai food before. If u r looking for a decent meal with good delivery service, this is your place, if you are looking for great Thai food..lb look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Sawasdee based on the good reviews; I'm always on the lookout for good Thai restaurants in the south hills. I decided to order the country pad Thai for takeout, as it was advertised to be more authentic and spicy. Unfortunately, it tasted like regular pad Thai to me. In fact, I couldn't taste any spice at all in the dish and neither was I given a choice of spice level. Honestly, it just tasted like sweet and sour rice noodles. Although I didn't enjoy the pad Thai, delivery was relatively quick. Perhaps my lackluster experience was an isolated incident. If ever my Thai craving strikes and I don't feel like leaving the house, I may consider ordering something else from the menu for takeout again."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, YUM, yum, and YUM!!! I am a huge fan of Thai food, and Sawasdee Thai Kitchen has amazing Thai food.   I have enjoyed Thai food locally at Nicki's Thai Kitchen, Thai Me Up, Bangkok Balcony and Silk Elephant, and Sawasdee Thai is tied for my favorite! Nicki's is my favorite for atmosphere, hello super cool back yard seating, and the food is great too. Thai Me Up probably has my single favorite dish. But the Country Pad Thai (a spicy version of Pad Thai) at Sawasdee is my very favorite Pad Thai around town. It's always done perfectly, and it's always delicious! The Crazy Noodle and Pad See You are both delicious as well. I love noodle dishes, and theirs are delicious!!!   Their Tom Kha soup is AMAZING! I always get it spicy, and it's so very good. The ginger salad is eh, not worth it. The Tempura Appetizer is good if you are craving fried food, as its light and crispy, yet hits the spot for fried goodness. They have a pretty extensive menu, and I haven't even tried much more than their noodle dishes, soups, and appetizers.   They do have a few tables to eat in at the restaurant, but the atmosphere there is certainly nothing to write home about. You're usually the only occupied table in the restaurant which can be odd. BUT they deliver, which has been delicious for my tummy, but bad for my pocketbook...   Finally, good Thai in the South Hills!"}
{"text":"The sauces are very flavorful, the sea food isn't over cooked, and the vegetables are perfectly cooked as well. Best Thai food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch for the first time! The service was great! So friendly and fast! The food is extremely fresh and delicious! Homemade soup and salad rolls to start. Green curry, mango stir fry for the main course! Definitely recommend the lunch portions!"}
{"text":"I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken and they were great.  Very spicy, which I liked.  Not a huge fan of the $10 minimum for credit cards."}
{"text":"Not much to say.  I love the selection of menu items.  I love the super-fast delivery.  I love the friendly employees.  Overall great option if you crave anything Thai."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we were excited to try this restaurant today, but were a little disappointed with the price and the quality of the food. It could definitely be personal preference, because the flavor of the food is spot-on, but the curries were very thin, which detracted from the meal for me. The tea is good, but not great (although, again, it could be that I got used to a more sugary version in the South). Most of all, the portion sizes are small, but the prices are not. The people we spoke with were very nice, and got everything together very quickly, but we'll probably try to find another Thai place in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but very overpriced.  Also, the service is here is not very good, they can be very rude. I have ordered food for delivery several times and then was told we live too far for them to deliver. I was trying to ask if I could pick up instead and they wouldn't let me speak and just kept saying \"No, too far!\" For the price, it's not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Was craving Thai food after seeing a google doodle about pad Thai, so a group of us found Sawasdee and made a stop in. Didn't realize it was mainly delivery/takeout, but luckily we were able to claim the single table they had inside! Two people appeared to be working tonight, with one running deliveries & pickups and the other doing the register, cooking, and pickups. While they seemed plenty busy, both employees were very friendly and welcoming, with the woman apologizing for wrapping our stuff up to go before realizing we were dining in (no big deal).   The food itself was decent - between the three of us we got pad thai w/ chicken, pad see-ew w/ chicken, and drunken noodles with tofu. The food came out pretty quickly and piping hot. The chicken was kind of dry and bland, but the noodles and vegetables were fine. The drunken noodles also got a thumbs up. 1-10 heat scale customization for each dish as well so you can get any item to your taste! This may not be our first pick for Thai food, especially if we are closer to some of the other good Thai places in the South Hills, but it's quick and friendly, and we'll definitely make another stop sometime to try out more items."}
{"text":"For a Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh to give you the food as spicy as you ask for (ears ringing, tears and snot) is bold. It's a small place in the back of a strip mall with no seating turning out serious food. I had the chicken larb - a dry, spicy meat salad loaded with herbs and spices - and the Tom Yum soup, a richly flavored broth with tomatoes, mushroom and shrimp. I haven't eaten too many larbs but the heavy use of mint was intense. This might just be the bias of a Western palate but I wanted an element of moisture, maybe a fish sauce condiment. The Tom Yum, for 4 dollars, should be on some kind of list for food that makes you love the world again, or just Pittsburgh, during winter. A top contender for best Thai restaurant in the 'Burgh.  Also did anyone try the Tempura cheesecake? Can you review that?"}
{"text":"They have best spring rolls that I have ever had. They were delivered and still unreal. The Pad Thai was also great. This is my new favorite Thai place."}
{"text":"Yum!   I picked up some country pad thai (one shrimp and one chicken) and some seaweed salad for dinner one night.  Loved it!   The guy at the counter was super friendly and included an extra side of chili flakes for my boyfriend who likes insanely spiced dishes.   He also offered to bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to wander around inside when waiting.     Important note:  There is pad thai and country pad thai on the menu here - the country pad thai has a little spice, while the regular is the mild Americanized version.   I like a decent amount of spice and the country style dish was perfect for me.  The boyfriend added the chili flakes and deemed it delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome! I really can't say enough about this amazing little secret right across the street from Trader Joe's. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Good food, I've always ordered mild spiced and had no problem but this time did same and got extreme spice I could not eat at all. I asked for a replacement and they refused with a rude attitude showing little respect or appreciation for their regular customers. Much like the extreme over-spiced meal it left a bad taste in my mouth about this place and their management."}
{"text":"From the summer roll to the pad Thai everything was great. Glad that we found this nice little gem by us. This is honestly the best Thai food I've had in the Pittsburgh area.  We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have never been to the restaurant but we get delivery often. The delivery is always pretty fast and the food arrives hot and fresh. The vegetables in the stir fry are always crisp instead of soggy and over cooked. I have ordered lots of things and they have all been great. My all time favorite are the crazy noodles. They are so saucy and the best I have ever had. This is my go to delivery place."}
{"text":"Sawasdee Thai Kitchen was an outstanding surprise while spending three days at the Crowne Plaza Pittsburgh South. Fortunately we found this gem of a restaurant the first day. The summer rolls come as you would expect - a roll - as opposed to the sushi roll presentation shown on their website. They were excellent. Fresh and crispy contents with a perfectly done wrap. We ordered the Hot Basil with Chicken and the Country Pad Thai with Chicken. Both were truly outstanding. Everything was properly cooked, hotness was spot on for the American palate, and the portion sizes were more than ample. Definitely good value for money. We ate leftovers for lunch the second day and plan to finish things off before hitting the road on day three, tomorrow.  Previous reviews have cited limited inside seating. When we were there there was none.  For context my sister-in-law is first generation Thai. She came to the US as a young adult. Family gatherings include a LOT of cooking and I have become SIL's sous. I think I can say with confidence that I know whereof I speak regarding Thai food.   We only get to Pittsburgh once or twice a year. Sawasdee Thai Kitchen will be on our \"must do\" list when we are here."}
{"text":"very good addition to dining in the south hills - my new \"go to\" place for Asian food"}
{"text":"This place earns 4 of its 5 stars by simply existing! Rice Inn is the only other place near our home that delivers Thai food, and it really doesn't count since they are actually a Chinese restaurant that has a few Thai dishes. We have gotten 4 different entrees/curries, the summer rolls, and the fried tofu appetizer so far, and ALL of them have been delicious! I wish the prices were a bit lower, but I am willing to pay for the convenience and tastiness. Also, we discovered that the food is MUCH better/flavorful if  you order a higher heat level. We didn't specify the first time, which was a mistake, because the food was decent but not quite there... The second time, we specified level 7 on a scale of 1-10 and it was PERFECT."}
{"text":"Love this place I always get the Massaman curry and the crab Rangoon it's off the hook delicious"}
{"text":"Food tastes different after their 3 weeks break. Menu's changed. Miss their old menu(or old owners) :( Pricey food doesn't reach quality."}
{"text":"I completely love their food and I've only ate there once! I just wish they didn't open so late but it is honestly worth it!"}
{"text":"Great quality tasting Thai food.  Quick service.  This place will be a go to for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this restaurant, located across from Trader Joe's in Mt. Lebanon.  I ordered satay chicken, vegetable spring rolls, and chicken pad see-ew.     The quoted me a 30 minute deliver time, but it was 15 minutes.  Everything was extremely hot and obviously just cooked.    Chicken satay: this was an odd greenish color. It came with peanut sauce, which was cold and solid in the little cup. It also had a watery cucumber sauce that was very fresh tasting.  I liked both sauces, but the chicken was a bit strange.   Vegetable spring rolls: standard spring rolls. They were pretty decent, and they give you 5 of them for 4.95. They came with a sweet and sour sauce. I liked them and would order them again.   Pad see-ew: this was a mix of chewy wide noodles, cabbage, overcooked brownish broccoli, carrots, and egg.  I liked the taste of this dish, but it was slightly bland. I'd get it spicier next time (I ordered mild). I melted the peanut sauce from the satay and put it on this dish and it was really good.   Portion sizes: I don't understand people saying they were small portions. My container of pad see-ew was packed full and enough for 3 meals.  5 spring rolls for 4.95, and 4 skewers of chicken.  I got 2 cans of pop and my total, including tax was 26.74.  Pretty good value for the amount of food I got.   Overall, I'd for sure order from here again."}
{"text":"Second time around. I ordered red curry chicken. 3/10 spice level. So hot I couldn't eat it. Threw it in the trash. They exceeded my spice expectations last time but not like this. I shared it with them when I placed my order and was still punished. The quality is good here. Perhaps I would order something boring without any heat but right now I'm too offended to think about returning."}
{"text":"Our go-to Thai in the South Hills. We have found ourselves waiting for our order to be ready at pick up (which has been frustrating), but more times then not, the order is ready & waiting. Be sure to tell them your spice level - they don't always ask. Being a spice wimp, if you forget, I find it too spicy. But if you speak up, you will be accomodated. Favorites: Pad See-Ew tofu & veggie spring rolls. BTW, there's no room for eating... it's take out only! Sawasdee rarely disappoints!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via GrubHub. Curry and Pad Thai were very good. Tom Kha soup was excellent. Our next order we will pass on the tempura appetizer. Overall it exceeded our expectations and we look forward to our next dinner order."}
{"text":"I can't be a fair judge about how authentic the thai cuisine was that I had, but it sure is good. I was really happy to find some great simple delivery food that wasn't pizza. Between the mixed veggies, brown rice, teriyaki chicken, and a yummy thai iced tea, I'm sold!"}
{"text":"After reading several reviews, I was excited to try this restaurant. The spring rolls were delicious, but the pineapple chicken was bland and not as good as any other Thai place. Same with the basil chicken. Also the prices higher than most other Thai restaurants around. Will not be going back after disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great flavor and a big menu with plenty of options. The drunken noodles, pad satay, and curries have all been good. My wife loves the pineapple fried rice. The delivery is always very quick as well."}
{"text":"Terribly bland. My pumpkin curry was weak as water and filled with frozen peas and carrots. The steamed dumplings were good. The rest of the meal was rubbish."}
{"text":"I moved from Seattle and I was so sad that I was leaving my favorite Thai spots. That went out the door! My friend and I stumbled upon this place while heading to Traders and we were pleasantly surprised.   We tried the Crazy Noodles, Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Bangkok Duck, Panang Duck, and mango/sticky rice. Oh my gosh, everything is so flavorful! You can't leave this place without their mango and sticky rice. - They're also friendly and fast!"}
