{"text":"Clipper Cafe is the place to get your food bargain in downtown financial district. The catch is to know when they have their specials (eg jerk chicken Fridays, Thanksgiving Holiday Turkey specials) to get the most out of this cafe. Their food portions are decent on the combo deals and they usually charge 30-40% less than most food court restaurants in the area. For example, on their jerk chicken Fridays, you get two pieces of chicken (one breast and one drumstick) plus rice, veggies, and dessert for $7.95 pretax. They also serve Starbucks coffee here for about 20% less prices charged at Starbucks. The food is fresh and is very typical of your cafe food served at the schools. Sadly this place is up for renovations but I'm excited for the new upcoming reopening!"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place, from reading the previous reviews it's no wonder that it's a hidden secret.  Originally this place was meant for Scotia Bank employees as they used to ask for proof of ID, however times have changed and its hush hush.....as long as you look, dress and act the part you can blend in with the Scotia staff :)  If you're looking for a fancy place, look elsewhere for the Clipper Cafe....KEY WORD..\"CAFE\" says it all. It's your traditional high school-looking place that's serving some comfort food from chicken, mash potatoes, and beef dishes to egg plant parmigiana, burgers, soups and stir fry.  What makes this place a steal are its food choices (some of its outsourced food) and prices.  I mean where in the financial district can you get a full meal (drink and dessert) for under $8? Nowhere! I had their eggplant parmigiana with broccoli and rice, which was OKAY, and for dessert I had their cinnamon coffee cake with a bottle of Eska water.  In there seating area its comfy and simple, and most of all, clean.  They also have staff that walk around periodically cleaning up tables and removing trays, which is always a personal touch.  Pros: -Cheap eats -Clean -Choice of foods.  Cons: -Quality"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better kept secrets of the Financial District, the Clipper Cafe is basically Scotiabank's employee cafeteria. It supplies good meals cheap and no one cares of you actually work there. The meals aren't subsidized but aren't ready marked up either. Great sandwiches and salads, and decent hot meals most days. You can't go wrong for the price.   The only trick is finding it. Locate the main elevators and go to the fourth floor, then follow the horde."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of this place.. Cheap eats, and it's a secret so if you're reading this, keep it on the DL ;)  I have been there to grab lunch a few times but this morning I was craving a cheese croissant for some reason and Longo's (in the PATH, which I checked first) didn't have  them.. So I snuck off to the Clipper and they had plain croissants, chocolate croissants, and the ever-elusive cheese croissant.  I did notice that their breakfast special today was spinach & feta & eggwhites on rye (for like $2.72 or something unheard-of for food in the financial district) and I totally would've got that if I hadn't been already on a mission.  $2.60 later and I had 2 cheese croissants and headed back to my desk.. #omnomnom"}
{"text":"The de facto favourite of any broke summer intern. With a rotating menu of cafeteria fare, grabbing lunch here also makes you feel like something of a university student.  The portions are decently large, and the desserts are alright. The Clipper Cafe is subsidized by Scotia, so the prices are substantially lower than anything else you can find at Bay & King.  Sitting close to the window on a dark day also gives a decent view of BMO's trading floor on the west side of Bay."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, I love picking up breakfast here.   $2.92 breakfast sandwiches (changes daily), $1.30 muffins (huge), make your own fruit cups (by weight)   The ladies who work here are also super sweet."}
{"text":"This is a little \"secret\" cafe hidden in the old Scotia building. It's apparently supposed to be for Scotia employees, but I bet like 90% of the people eating in the cafe don't even go there. It's definitely a very cafeteria-style vibe which reminds me of my university/residence days with like the plastic trays and plastic packaging for their cakes and everything. It really is pretty cheap compared to other places in the PATH - a full meal with a drink and dessert is less than $8, so feel free to go crazy and treat yo'self here. Food quality is decent. I tried the steamed basa and it was fine, albeit a bit on the salty side. The portion was filling though, and I guess for $8 I can't really complain. Come here if you want to feel like a badass for an hour or like a young student again."}
{"text":"This place is a 'secret' cafe, insofar as it's not supposed to be open to the public. Apparently it's for Scotiabank staff only, but no one checks to see whether you're an employee, so as long as you're dressed like an office worker, you'll be fine.  Finding this place can be a bit of a challenge - it's in the older half of Scotia Plaza (44 King St. W), on the fourth floor. Take the elevators up, then  head straight down the hallway and to your right.  The food is of varying quality, but all of it is subsidized, so you can get a main dish, veggies, a dessert and a drink for about $7, which is cheaper than any food court option. There's a salad bar, multiple hot entree stations, and a small selection of prepared foods. Options abound, so you're likely to find something at least palatable.  Check this place out, if only for the 'thrill' of eating somewhere you're not technically supposed to be. The dining room is quite nice too; and it's not impossible to find a seat. There are waiters that come around and clear your plates once you're done."}
