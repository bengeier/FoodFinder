{"text":"Damn. I wasn't expecting that. THAT Bread! THAT Pasta. THOSE Meatballs. I will be eating here regularly and working my way through the menu. Do yourself a favour and order the meatball sandwich and get it spicy."}
{"text":"Great take out from this small Italian themed place. Same owner as Kings Table and Luce."}
{"text":"Fresh food that is very reasonably priced. Great when you just don't feel like cookin' but wanna bring food home. We ordered the meat chili and mini butter tart to go. Chili came with a fresh slice of bread and was full of carrots and other root veggies + ground beef and red kidney beans. Usually I like more meat in my chili but really appreciated all the veg in this one. The woman working the counter was very friendly and my brief encounter with the owner was also great!"}
{"text":"Went back and had the meatball...awsome...will be having it again soon very tasty...and huge too"}
{"text":"Just checked out the newest \"food to go\" in the Liberty Village/Niagara neighbourhood -- MorsoMe. The food is take out but it's very pleasant place to wait while your meatball (chicken, steak, veal, etc.) sandwich is cooked up fresh in the kitchen in the back.  A few pizza's on display but next time I'll get something cooked to order from the delicious-looking menu selection, including Prosciutto (w mushrooms, peppers & onion), Rapini (w goat cheese, mushrooms), Smoked Salmon, or Pear!  Co-owners Maria & Audrey are creating a tasty & friendly new local option for quick & fresh!"}
{"text":"I just recently discovered Morso Me. This place is fantastic for lunch!  The food is decently priced for the area and more than enough. I've only tried the Chicken Parmesan and Steak sandwiches so far, but they're both fantastic. The bread is great. The meat is freshly cooked and also great. Simply great Italian sandwiches.  The staff are also incredibly friendly and clearly take pride in the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Just learned about this restaurant and enjoyed a delicious chicken parmesan. Will definitely go back and try pasta and meatballs sandwich. Only bad thing is no indoor seating. Hey on a warm summers day u can go and eat in park beside it."}
{"text":"Walked by on my way from work and decided to try the chicken parm sandwich. Delicious and fresh! Great portion size too. Can't wait to try more and hopefully try to convince them to bring the arancini ball back like they had at Luce :)"}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to eating out and this is the best I've had in ages. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu. Shout out to the bread. It is ridiculously good. I could just eat that bread all day."}
{"text":"Where do I even start?!?!? I love absolutely everything about this place. From the owners who are the most accommodating people you have ever meet, to the most amazing home style food I have ever tasted (don't tell my mom i said that!!) at great prices. I'm almost hesitant to write about how affordable they are, so that they don't realize it and change their prices!!! Everything is from scratch from the fresh bread to even the mayo which they make in house. I go probably once a week and have never had a bad meal from the chicken parm sandwich which is big enough for 2 meals, to their version of Italian stir fry which is so flavorful and delicious. They have recently added gelato which is also amazing - I don't think they make the gelato, but who cares as long as its cold and taste good right?!?! This is such a gem for the area which is all horribly overpriced and unoriginal for such a hip area. Such a great find, and hopefully they never leave or I wont have anything to eat!"}
{"text":"Wish I had known about this place last time that I visited Toronto! Huge fan of great sandwich shops, and the fact that I could get gelato as well was a nice bonus.  There were a bunch of different sandwich options available off the menu from behind the counter. I opted to try the daily special for my first time here, because I'm special, and sometimes you just want to feel special right? Well I definitely felt great after this. The meatballs were tasty, but also a little heavy. Definitely left me full through the day.  Honestly, felt a little overwhelmed when I saw the gelato. Not because there were too many choices, but because I wasn't expecting it going in and so I had to make a split second decision. And my next decision will be to come here after work some time so that I can get more gelato."}
