{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and dinner takeout. The service is always very good. The food is pretty decent - butter chicken has nice large chunks of fresh chicken, not the strange perfectly square chicken loaf cubes you sometimes get in Indian dishes, and the sauce is nice. The lamb curry tastes wonderful and is not too spicy, and the lamb itself is never overcooked (or undercooked, for that matter). They obviously use good quality meats in their dishes. The naan is thin and sometimes greasy but it tastes good. Overall, not the best Indian food I've had but it certainly hits the spot if you want something cheap and close to home. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I want to start off with something positive here:

The customer service is terrific.

The food was borderline awful. The chicken and beef were old tasting and tough.
The rice was HARD in spots indicating it too was old, and the naan wasn't nice at all.

The potato /cauliflower dish was all right.

I really wanted to like this restaurant, but I advise you go elsewhere. What a shame.

Lots of rice and sauce but no big chunks of chicken.  That would be my only comment."}
