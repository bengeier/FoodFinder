{"text":"A very nice cozy spot on Unionville Main Street. All their baking goods are delicious and freshly made onsite. (English as one, Croissants, Sourdough and Fench Brioche!) 

Jasmine Ice Latte is something you definitely should try! They are a bit pricy but it's worth every penny. Our new favourite item on the menu is their Fried Chicken Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Came here for a morning pick-me-up. The place was very spacious, clean, and comfortable with relaxing music playing in the background, staff was friendly and courteous.  Had their organic cappuccino, coffee and croissants, and also tried their chocolate macaroon. The drinks were good, the croissants were very fresh (the apricot one was absolutely delicious - not too sweet and oozing freshness), and the quality of the macaroon was excellent - perfect texture and taste.  The only reason why this is not a five-star review is because it would have been nice to have more selection of baked goods (since they do it so well).  Found a gem in Unionville."}
{"text":"Saw this place while walking along Main St. Unionville, never noticed it last summer when I walked by so I thought I should check it out. Right when I walked in, there was a menu hanging on a wall in front of me. This is super convenient mostly because it's easy to see compared to other places where the menu is above and behind the counter. 

They have quite a selection of macarons and cakes that looked really tasty but I came in for a latte and tried to order vanilla latte. The girl behind the counter asked if I have ever tried the rose latte (which I haven't) and recommended that one and so that was the one I ordered.

The rose latte was so smooth. The rose flavour is light, delicate, and tasted elegant. I did not regret getting her recommendation. The total price was a little bit over $6.

I ended up asking the friendly girl who made my drink when they opened. Turns out, they opened in January, which explains why I didn't notice it last summer. 

The interior is spacious and minimalistic. There are small tables near the front and bigger tables for groups at the back.

Super friendly place where the items offered are made fresh. I would visit again to try their other drinks and pastries!"}
{"text":"A solid 3 1/2 stars.  Their strong point is their brunch.  Came with my mom and family, and we had the braised beef eggs benedict, chicken burger and Angus beef burger.  It states on their menu that nothing is from frozen which makes this place more appealing.   Also noticed that the barista/server seemed to care about her coffee - she was doing the pour over properly.  Overall good, not mindblowing amongst the tough competition in the area, but very good. It seems to be usually not crowded and is spacious, which is a plus for a family with a young child."}
{"text":"Long wait for mediocre bubble tea. Tapioca was solid and in giant clumps, and the drink temperature was very uneven. Came here because there was a giant line at the other bubble tea place, and this one didn't. Now it's very understandable. The straws were stuck to the wrapping as well. Both the royal fresh milk tea and lavender earl grey was less enjoyable than their competitors.

Pricing is ok, but likely not going to come back."}
{"text":"A cozy coffee shop on Main St. in Unionville, which opened only for 8 months. It was a weekday morning. Quiet and clean. Owner is welcoming. They make fresh cones daily. 

We found a table inside and a lot of empty space....good for us chatty chatty and enjoyed quietly for 3 hrs long in a cozy cute cafe and brunch.  

Menu is easy one piece both sided, nice and simple.  The place is quite clean and empty. I hope they can add more decor or books on their shelve.   

Lets talk about food. Price is a little high but they look very presentable and attractive.  Their food is warm and fresh cones are wonderful.  We ordered one vegetarian egg Benedict and one meat egg Benedict. For vegetarian , viola what a great new selection for vegan or vegetarian.  

Food looked and tasted so good and fresh.  We enjoyed their drinks too. Dark hot chocolate and iced jasmine cafe latte, special huh? I never see anywhere yet offer Dark Hot Chocolate on the menu. This is one of the kind drink which make your meal special.  

We enjoyed a nice quiet brunch in this historic cafe house. The only score they lost a mark from my perspective was a fly found flying around the cones in an opened pastry area.  ...   it made me a bit uncomfortable if they could improve on food safety.  

Overall, will give it for another chance but I concern if they would able to continue this business since it was deadly quiet a a weekday morning. In 3 hrs, there was only us and one walked in for a coffee.......a poor customers traffic on regular noon and lunch time.... . I hope they will improve the food safety in the front pastry storage area..     will give them a chance :)"}
{"text":"I would say it's about 3.5 stars.

This place is clean,  simple and tidy and lots of room between tables. I think the whole cafe is operated by two ladies only, and both are quite polite and they do tried their best to accommodate your requests. We tried some of the food and drinks...

First of all, just want to mention the menu being served now is different from the ones shown in the photos, so just want to point that out just in case. I did want to tried the pancake with berries and the mushroom tartine but no longer being offered. So you should check the menu shown on their website instead... Anyway, here comes some of the comments I have..

Hojicha Latte -  Good!. I like this one the best, strong Hijicha flavor with creamy foam. I do like this drink and I will have it again. I would recommend this one. :)

Regular Latte - Just average - It's not particular good but not bad either. Its a regular cup of Latte. For some comparing references from uptown, I would say Latte from Red Bulb better and Alchemy is abit better. 

Macha Latte - Above average. It's a good cup of Matcha latte and again with nice creamy foam. But in terms of matcha, Duo is still the best, but better than Alchemy's, in my opinion. So order one if you feel like one at that time.

I find the lady without glasses makes better latte art. :)

Veggie Egg Benny - my wife ordered this one but I took a byte. The biscuit they used on the bottom of the egg benny are quite good and I wonder if they make them inhouse. Probably is because they make/sell their own organic bread/pastry. Also for this dish, I like their version of the Hollandaise sauce, taste quite light and have some kind of berries aroma (not sure if they are berries but anyway, I like it). you can choose organic salad or fries as side, we picked the organic salad. The dressing is abit too sour for my personal taste. Maybe I will ask them to go easy on the dressing next time

Veggie burger - Taste like the real thing.. the texture and taste of the patty are good. Again, the bun used is very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, quite fresh!! Not the kind of bread that is quite hard on the outside that can sometimes cut thru your gum. I think they put too much BBQ sauce and mayo in the sandwich for my personal taste.. so I need to scrap some off - but not a big deal for me, an easy fix for me. You have a choice of organic salad or fries as sides and I picked the salad. Again, I will asked them to go easy on the dressing next time.

Overall, its a pleasant experience and I will be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Cute bakery that feels surprisingly very tranquil. Not a lot of seating but it's also not very busy. Jazzy music transports visitors as they wait for excellent lattes (of which there is a variety of tea and coffee versions). Brunch options are alright although not a very large menu. Bakery selection is sparse when you walk in. I think you are meant to order your breads in advance. But the drinks are decent and it's a pleasant place to sip and chat or study so I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"(Food:)
The TEPPANYAKI SHITAKE EGGS BENNY was sooo good! I think it was definitely the best eggs benny I've ever had or at least one of the best.  It has the added bonus of being a vegetarian option as well!  The dish is made up of beautifully roasted mushrooms and a well poached egg on-top of a scone!  Usually eggs bennys are on an english muffin, so I was skeptical about it being on a scone.  However, it turned out to be a welcome change!  The scone was light and crumbly, and added a sweet touch to the dish as well.  
This plate also comes with a side salad and roasted potatoes.  Both are done extraordinarily well.  I can't say enough good things about this dish!

(Price:) 
TEPPANYAKI SHITAKE EGGS BENNY:  14.95

(Ambience:) 
Very quaint and cute.  The place gets a lot of natural sunlight.  Also there is seating in the back if there are more customers.

(Service:)  
The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star rating was because it seemed like there was only one person working there, and so it took about 20 minutes to get our dishes.  They did put a disclaimer in the menu saying to expect a longer wait because everything they do is organic and fresh (no microwaves or pre-cooked frozen food, and they make things from scratch), and the dish was ABSOLUTELY worth the wait.  I still can't give it that extra star though because of the long wait.

(Comparable:)
Ramona's Kitchen and Alchemy Coffee also do Eggs Benny well.  But this place takes the cake.  

(Overall:)
Wonderful experience.  The food was delicious and worth the long wait, but do be prepared to wait when you get here!  Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but unfortunately I don't. 

I walk by all the time but never noticed it until I did a yelp search. I saw eggs Benny and I want!

I ordered a latte with almond milk. Since I was dining in, it was brought to my table. I was not told where to get sugar if I needed any. I decided to wait until my food arrives before I make a decision on sugar or no. 

No eggs Benny today, I opted for the big breakfast. It came with 3 sausages, one bacon, two eggs and two slices of bread. 

Everything was heavily seasoned with salt and pepper. I felt so thirsty after 2 bites. 

The ketchup was very tomato pasty if you know what I mean. It ain't organic ketchup either so get some Heinz! But I had a lot of ketchup anyways because the food was salty. My fries were not as crispy as I would like them. My whole breakfast tastes the same due to the salt and pepper. - all my taste buds tasted was just really just salt and pepper. 

My almond latte was good but not enough coffee taste. 

It's roomy here so it can do well if the food and beverage quality improves. You don't have to worry about not finding a table here. 

I want the owners to just go around the area and try out other cafes and know their competition. Because there are COMPETITORS and they are doing great! Cough* Alchemy

They also have the space to make a nice condiments station. It looks pretty basic right now. And service is good, not exceptional though."}
{"text":"I have been dying to check this place out, not only because it's an organic bakery but also because they serve eggs benny!!!

My first impression when I walked-in was \"Wow! This place is very quaint and cute!!\" Truly, the décor of this cafe is very earthy and natural. I love it as it reflects their philosophy for organic. 

Their coffee is locally sourced and they make their own coffee blend--which was super delicious! I highly recommend drinking the coffee black to get its rich notes in the flavour. The chocolate croissant is super flaky, sweet, and fresh! The croissant practically melts in your mouth... a wonderful complement to the coffee.

Now the focus of my meal... the teppanyaki shiitake eggs benny!! With much anticipation, I took my first bite and it did not disappoint! The perfectly poached egg, shiitake mushroom, cooked spinach, and organic scone smothered in hollandaise sauce was just delightful. Then I took a bite into the home fries and I was blown away! I expected the potato to be a bit more firm, but it was very soft. It is much different from the usual and I loved how the chef took the extra effort to cook the potato before it is fried. The salad on the side gives a nice change in texture between the cooked items.

Service was very friendly and attentive! 

Would I return? MOST DEFINITELY!!! There are so many items on the menu that I want to try."}
{"text":"Had to step into this cafe. We need more independently owned stores that make our main st a better place. I love my city. Skip the Starbucks and try something new.

We tried the Uji Sencha green tea. It was very soothing and quite pungent in flavour. 

The interior has a nice bare bone quality to it. Simple. Hipster.

I hope more places like this pop up and push out the big chain stores."}
{"text":"Cute little bakery restaurant on Unionville Main Street. Unique selection of drinks, and their brew coffee is smooth and easy on the palette. Their menu options are unlike many other brunch places. We ordered their shiitake mushroom yakisoba and the brisket egg Benedict. When they called the yakisoba the shiitake mushroom yakisoba, I expected quality shiitake mushrooms only but the dish had a variety of other mushrooms as fillers, so definitely star off for that because the name of he dish is misleading and therefore the dish is overpriced. The brisket Benedict was hearty and flavourful as well. I had to take off more stars because both dishes tasted like the chef just DOUSED them with a bag of salt. I think I'll stick with ordering their drinks and maybe try their baked goods but won't be staying for brunch again."}
{"text":"Coffee was in room-temperature and missing the aroma.  The chocolate filling in the macaroon was too sweet and overpowered the macaroon itself.  The texture was good though; fluffy body and chewy interior."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place. Did they change the owners? The menu has changed to now with Chinese characters? 
I ordered jasmine latte - so gross worst then Starbucks!!! Egg Benny - Everything is so salty just like Chinese cooking! The chochou is no longer available. Very disappointed? I wouldn't pay this much for this quality of food!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place along Main Street Unionville. Inside was spacious and clean.

There were two ladies behind the counter and they were both really nice. I ordered a London Fog (around $4.50?) and one of their mini chouchou $2.50), the mango & passion fruit one.

London Fog: It's okay, but kind of tasteless. I asked one of the girls if I could have caramel syrup added to it, and although she was confused, she accommodated my request. Points for service, but The price was a little high for the drink size.

Mango & Passion Fruit Chouchou: It was good! As soon as I took a bite, there was a burst of flavour. Yum. The cream inside wasn't runny enough in my opinion, but I still enjoyed it. However, $2.50 for such a small dessert is a little much. (Then again, macarons are about $3 and they're small.)

I like this place! I'll definitely come back when I'm in Unionville. The staff is welcoming and are lovely people."}
{"text":"Very cozy cafe with a few spots of reserved parking at the back. Had the hojicha latte which was very flavourful! Also ordered the vegetarian egg benedict which was very tasty and the popcorn chicken. Both came with a choice of salad or fries. Price for the popcorn chicken was a little high considering the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. I was there at lunchtime on a Thursday. The place itself is clean, nice atmosphere and polite staff. 

The first thing I noticed was that there was very little available in the way of pastries. Most of the shelves and the cases were empty. I realize they didn't have a lot of business but still...a few macaroons and croissants don't really have a lot of appeal. I would have liked more selection to choose from since the descriptions of everything NOT available looked great. Don't get me wrong, the croissants and  macaroons looked decadent but I was in the mood for a muffin or a scone.

I ordered a pour over coffee and was underwhelmed. Quite bitter. The one at Alchemy Coffee down the road much better.

Also, if you pitch yourself as an organic bakery and Cafe, don't serve me non-organic cream. I don't mind, but others may take issue as the word 'organic' is right in the store name.

I might give it another try. Pour over is difficult to do well and their lattes looked good. Maybe I just didn't get their speciality item."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in unionville.  I enjoyed their matcha latte.  I haven't tried the food as yet but that will be done on my next visit to this place.  It's also pretty clean to chillax and coffee with your friends."}
{"text":"The food better be good because so far I'm not impressed with the service. 

Seems like they only have one chef and one other person taking orders, making coffee, serving and cleaning tables. 

We ordered 45 minutes ago and still haven't been served our coffee. Usually  you're served coffee first while you wait for your food. But then again this is an Asian owned place so no surprise that everything comes together."}
