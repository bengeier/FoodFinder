{"text":"Very cute small coffee shop. (See pictures ) very ideal for small baby shower, small bridal showers.  The coffee wasn't the greatest I ever had but it wasn't bad either.  I think this place is very ideal for a first date setting or sitting down and having a chat with old friends.   My reason I've given a three stars was because I was looking for  good local coffee.  I travel a lot and I always try to find local coffee shop.  Definitely will swing by again and try something different.

The place is a lil hard to locate. Once you pull into the plaza it's right next to the CVS and the dry cleaner."}
{"text":"Um, FLASHBACK.  Lace doilies on the tables.  65+ club sipping coffee.  Bun-O-Matic coffeemakers.  The coffee walked a fine line between \"burnt\" and \"tastes like cigarette ashes.\"  Sigh, I was bummed.  I love a good local coffee shop but this place semi-scared me."}
{"text":"Brielle's is one of the last locally owned coffee shops around.  Their location unfortunately, has not helped them in their pursuit of greatness.  Nor has the un-lit sign.  Fix these two things and I'll change my stars from 3 to 5!

Brielle's offers a variety of tasty treats that are made in-house daily!  I stopped this morning on my way to work and purchased a variety of 20 pastries.  Lordy, Lordy, these were so good; I salivate just thinking about how good they were.  Brielle's hosts a bountiful coffee selection from regular to flavored, espresso drinks, and they also cater to the tea drinker with many lovely loose tea options.  You may purchase your teas of coffees by bulk too!  While I have not been for lunch I do anticipate going and soon.  The soups & salads sound delish!

This place is so cute in its Vitctorian-esque / Tea House style with lace doilies on the tables and antique folding auditorium chairs.  A perfect spot for a tea party and I'm sure any little girl would be in heaven.  Brielle's would be an ideal location for a Mother-Daughter Tea.  (Hello, you church ladies out there!)

I cannot say I have been more than once, but upon this visit the owners were so kind and gracious that I would recommend this spot to everyone and anyone!  Seriously, support the local business & get your butt to Brielle's!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and quality of coffee. Highly recommended! This is more than just a Ladies Tea place. Owner wants to make sure you have a good experience."}
{"text":"Yes...the location isn't the most convenient, however, I'm willing to go out of my way for a good local business! Also, ignore the one review that states the coffee is bad...they obviously don't know what they are talking about. The coffee is excellent and the sandwiches, tea and pastries are amazing. I love this place. They have wifi and yes...lace doilies on the tables. This is the perfect place for a baby shower or wedding shower (they do rent out the place for such events). I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. This place looks like they will charge you a lot by the interior but the price was just right, had a biscotti and an iced coffee. They have so much variety here even Italian.French sodas which I am still not sure what those are yet :) Not sure when I'll be back again but I'm looking forward to it. Gives a very cozy feeling."}
{"text":"I was visiting Ohio for a few days, and I needed to spend an hour waiting for my host to get off work, so I decided to check Brielle's out instead of the nearby Panera/Starbucks/Corporate options. I was not disappointed. The service was good, but the atmosphere, coffee and pastries are what earn this establishment 5 stars. It's cute. There really isn't a better way to describe it. There are lace dollies on each table, there's nice classical music playing, and despite the fact that it's next to CVS in a strip center, it feels homely inside. I found the Guatemalan coffee thoroughly satisfying. The raspberry strudel was extraordinary. You could tell it was fresh and made from real fruit/ingredients. 

I would return here frequently if I lived nearby or if they were open a little later. I imagine this isn't the part of town that draws late night crowds, so I can understand why they close at 5."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating it was hard to spot this place because all the signs look alike and it just says \"Brielle's\" with a little sign that says \"Coffee Heaven\".  Then as I walked in, it was a different feel... Elevator music playing with a victorian look. Definitely not your average coffee shop...

Ordered a cinnamon roll and white mocha.  The cinnamon roll was so amazingly dry but then again I came during the last hour of it being open.  The coffee was decent but better than Starbucks.  I feel like I am going to give this place another try during the day when everything is fresh to write another review."}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill when I was in the independence area. I live in Lakewood and am surrounded by coffee houses. All have a unique quirk to them and this one is no exception. I'm a professional barista myself and you could say I'm picky :)

The girl working the counter was very sweet and extremely helpful. Very knowledgeable and happily answered all of my many questions. The quality of her espresso was also on point.
The interior of this place is hella cute as well. Beautiful hand painted murals across the walls, Christmas music playing, shelf after shelf of different beans, a large drink menu, and an array of boutique style art and kitschy items. 

Very impressed with Brielle's. Definitely recommend it to someone just needing a quick coffee drink all the way to someone who wants to set up camp for a few hours with a cup I coffee and a goo read. 
Check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"I went in today to grab coffee with my daughter.  I walked in to the otherwise empty coffehouse to find the owner staring at me without a word until I said hello at the counter, halfway through the place.  I saw not one, but two nut coffees on the menu (nut allergy for one of us).  The more than annoyed owner said\"what's listed is all there is!\"  I took Chocolate Almond.  After literally draining what was left of the Chocolate Almond, he proceeded to fill the remainder of the cup with Costarican Blend.  No asking, no offer to make a fresh pot.  After paying, I left with this disgusting lukewarm mix (it found its way in the trash outside) there was, again, no thank you, no good bye.  I've been going to Brielle's for over 15 years and while the owner has never been overly welcoming or pleasant, today was an experience that has convinced me to NEVER go back again.  Starbuck's is a very short distance from Brielle's.   MUCH better coffee, much better service.  Luke warm coffee concocted out of what was left in the pots, plus a rude, annoyed owner make this place a definite don't!"}
{"text":"This cafe is a really great place to get some work done in a relaxed and friendly environment. I love finding new spots to go in Cleveland to grab a cup of nice, fresh coffee and I'll definitely return to this spot! They have a few flavors of fresh gourmet coffee daily and each one is just as good as the last. A must try!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute coffee shop that is a great escape from the corporate onslaught of Rockside Road. The girl there was nice. This isn't the type of coffee shop that hipsters \"work\", study or hang out in. I did enjoy the tea I had here. The little drink paraphernalia table was a beautiful piece of woodwork. That reminds me, I think Starbucks needs to get a little sink for people to dump their coffee in if it was too much. It just doesn't feel right dumping a liquid into a garbage. What if there is a hole in the bag? Then the person who is taking it out later is going to be cursing you and how you dumped that coffee in a garbage."}
