{"text":"Great little hidden place so you might be skeptical. But once you walk in they have great friendly family style service.  Fantastic food with fresh ingredients at a good price.  Glad I randomly stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"Had a nice morning bite to eat at a great price. Staff was vary nice. I would go out of my way to go there next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Tempe. We've been there 3 times since discovering it yesterday and have tried breakfast, lunch, and dessert items- you can't go wrong with anything here! I especially loved the monte cristo, sweet hot Italian sandwich, the Reuben, and the cherry turnover! 

And great hospitality to top it all off!!"}
{"text":"simple unpretentious high quality food. honestly one of the best breakfast burritos i've had in phoenix."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great cup of coffee.  Family owned small business."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in a industrial area of Tempe. As said before great sourdough! Everything is fresh. Coffee is awesome. Friendly local and a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Went on a hunt for a mom and pop cafe and found this gem hiding in plain sight. I love to see support for local arts (and coffee roasteries!) The coffee and Monte Christo were delicious and the service was great. If you're looking for something fast, but with that homemade-to-order feel, this is the place to go. We'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. Family owned and very friendly. We came for breakfast and had the chorizo and chile burritos. Also got americanos and the coffee was surprisingly incredible!! The service was speedy. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owners are always awesome and friendly and the food is always homemade and amazing! Get the stuffed tomato!"}
{"text":"An excellent locally-owned cafe. I stumbled upon it and was glad to make the find. I came in for breakfast and had the Italian Zucchini and Tomato omelet. It was delicious--one of the best omelets I've had anywhere! It came out fast and piping hot. You can taste the effort and care put into the marinara sauce-- a hint of sweetness and straightforward garlic but not overpowering. Generous amount of zucchini cooked to the perfect tenderness along with fresh tomato. Just the right amount of cheese. 

The sourdough toast is also worth noting. A generous portion of two, thick-cut slices with tasty strawberry jam. 

The prices are affordable. The atmosphere is clean and bright and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"First, the service was great and secondly I Like My eggs over medium & most places still bring them out over easy, not here they were cooked perfectly and the toast is made with homemade bread daily and it was outstanding. Now for the bad news, NO HASH BROWNS......They said they don't have time to cook them because they primarily service a business community where customers need to come and go quickly, interesting to me especially since there appeared to be some sort of a mens group 6 or so guys meeting there maybe a bible study and the cook (I'm assuming the owner) even came out and sat at their table for a few minutes between customers and other patrons didn't seem to be in any more of a hurry than your typical american, therefore I call BS on their no hash brown excuse. The ham they serve is of the very thin sliced variety like you would get on a sandwich, not the kind of ham you usually get when ordered at breakfast. Finally with the large milk I ordered (very good and cold by the way) my bill was almost $9.00 & for that I got to use the cheapest plastic utensils money can buy and of course the fork broke while cutting my eggs, if your going to use plastic utensils at least get a medium grade please!  Personally there are much better options in Tempe."}
{"text":"Well this was a special treat:  Here's another example of changing geographic awareness caused by the internet (Yelp!).  Needless to say, situated in the middle of an industrial area, I would have never run into this place on my own even though I live nearby - even when I saw where it was mapped out, I thought something was wrong... 

They serve breakfast 'all day' (which is why I showed up) - some cool twists on the traditional omelets - the sourdough was tasty too...  The owners were very nice and offered good conversation.  Definitely headed back for the Monti Cristo..."}
{"text":"One of the best blueberry muffins I have had. Definitely a must have. Service was fast and excellent. I will be back."}
{"text":"Pancakes were best I've had in years!  Very simple place with plastic ware, but very reasonable prices.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal yummy breakfast/lunch comfort food spot in Tempe. Relaxed environment, good coffee cant say enough nice about the owners who run it..."}
{"text":"I don't make it here as much as I would like too. They have the best Turrkey Club sandwich. My mouth is watering right now just thinking of it. 
The owners can't be beat. They are the nicest people. They remember me everytime I come in. Since I am not there that often it is good to feel welcome. 
I recommend the Morning Star Cafe to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious! I found this little jewel on Yelp and am glad I did! We were traveling from Texas to California and it was time for lunch when we hit Tempe. Don't let the fact that it is in an industrial park fool you. I felt like that made it a hidden gem. We got a Hot Sweet Italian sandwich and the Tuesday special-Turkey Relleno sandwich. Both were awesome! The people were friendly and the owner even sat down with us, at our encouragement, and told us the story of how the restaurant ended up there. A must try when in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Sandwhiches here were surprisingly delicious!!!!
A definite stop by for a bite if your in this area!"}
{"text":"Like going to Grandmas! Homey, food was delicious, friendly personal service. Simple menu that they will adjust to accommodate your need or want.  My husband said it's the best coffee he's had in a long time. Very happy. Oh...and their cappuccino white chocolate muffin was amazing.."}
{"text":"Great service, such nice welcoming people. I had breakfast here and would love if they got a better syrup. The have that regular very thin semi sweet syrup and my plate would have been amazing if I had some aunt jemima or something. Would definitely go back! Wish this place was in California!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch on a Thursday. Had the special, Patty Melt. It was delicious. It was also quite large. I wanted a salad to go with it and ordered a Caesar salad. It was also the size of my head. I could have shared the whole thing with two other people. The food was fantastic and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"GREAT food and very nice people. Had pancakes and a sausage and provolone wrap. Both were excellent. Great prices."}
{"text":"WOW!  I had the Tuesday special and it changed my life.  I am not a \"Joey Tribbiani-Sandwich-Loving-DUDE,\" but I have to say this was AMAZING!

The owners were working the front counter, talking with guests, and enhancing the experience.  

Do yourself a favor and go to Morning Star Cafe on Tuesday, order the special, and get ready for some AWESOME-NESS!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing little hole in the wall. Their bread is fresh baked and amazing. I had the cheesesteak and it was extremely fresh and piping hot. Prices are reasonable. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went on a tuesday got the special sandwiches delicious. The people there are very friendly and it nice spot"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service!  Great value.  When they recommend 1 pancake for the kids instead of three - go with the recommendation :)
Pancakes are huge!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading some reviews and am i glad we did.  Monte Cristo was delish! Very nice proprietors, place was clean and prices were great!"}
{"text":"VERY friendly homegrown hospitality. It's comfort food served with love. Very affordable too!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place! Extremely friendly, family owned cafe. The food is good, the service is good and the atmosphere is nice. Would recommend to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and we are glad we did. Nice people working behind the counter and the Hot Italian Sandwich we got tasted Home-Made! Tasted like something my Italian family would make back in the Midwest. I will definetly go back!!! You have to go."}
{"text":"Visited this little spot on my lunch break at the recommendation of a co-worker. Great sandwiches! I had a really good grilled turkey sandwich and yummy cookies. The chocolate cookies sprinkled in powder sugar were especially tasty!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food! Wow! I ate the Turkey Relleno. It has the perfect amount of heat and cheese! Yum I will definitely eat here more often!"}
{"text":"This place is ran by some extremely nice ppl. During my visit I over heard the lady and gentleman at the counter talk with customers like family. I was there for breakfast, 2 eggs, bacon and toast for $6 and change...  I'll come back for lunch since the menu seemed reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best kept secret in Tempe, Total Gem!!!  Great folks, serving great food.  I had a great omelet (spinach and swiss) awesome cup of joe (in a real cup) and absolute killer (just made fresh) Muffin."}
{"text":"I've been working 1 mile east on Alameda for 6 years and only found this place a few months ago (a brochure @ Gene's Auto Worx guided me).

My wife and I try to go once a week for breakfast, which is usually filling enough for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast sandwiches are very hearty! Multiple bread options, and all are fresh daily.

The coffee is good and served in mugs.  There are also some tasty muffins to choose from.

Only negative to say is that they are not open on weekends (makes sense, based on location), and that you have to pull cash from an ATM if you do not carry cash with you."}
{"text":"The breakfast was very good and the people are really nice. Showed up at 6 am and the griddle was hot.  They made an omelette for me"}
{"text":"Tuesdays are the best day! Grilled turkey chili relleno sandwich....MmmMmm!! Quaint little restaurant off the beaten path but not a secret during lunch hour. Call your order in ahead of time to be the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"I used yelp to find this place and I'm glad I did. We went here for breakfast and it was a great experience for my entire family. We all loved the food, I had the Monte Christo, wife had the scrambled egg sandwich, son had French toast, and daughter had eggs and sausage. The coffee was very good, freshly roasted from a place down the street. The coffee is a light breakfast blend, so don't criticize it if you are expecting burnt Starbucks (like some reviews). All the bread is also made nearby. Everything tasted very fresh and was prepared very well. The restaurant had a very homey feel to it. The owners took the orders, prepared the food, interacted with us and even gave us some ideas on what to do during our vacation. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife enjoyed her food, but I wasn't really impressed with my cheese steak, it was 70% bread, and 30%everything else. The atmosphere was also too religious for me."}
{"text":"Grilled turkey club is one of the best in the valley! Service excellent, as well."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this beauty yesterday morning.  Immediately it felt like we were sitting in someone's kitchen.  Mom and Pop restaurant through and through.  Met both Peter and Peggy and they immediately felt like friends.  The food was delicious - even the coffee was yummy!  I don't live nearby but will make the drive to visit again!"}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty decent but the customer server is nil"}
{"text":"Good homemade soup and sandwhiches and a perfect amount of food for the price. Very welcoming and comforting as a first time customer. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Nice quaint local place. Feel like we were visiting family and being served from there kitchen. Had the veggie omelette added spinach and zucchini. Very fresh veggies and local fresh baked toast served with it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable! Very family friendly, the perfect casual spot for some coffee, breakfast, and brunch! First time here and my husband and I were immediately welcomed. We were walked through the menu, given suggestions, it was nice. The staff is a wonderful pleasure. I feel its pretty rare to get such personal and friendly service. We ordered 2 wraps and a couple cookies. Everything was really good and fresh. We had the chorizo and green chiles and turkey with cranberry salsa wraps. I'd recommend either. Overall, this place is a cute family restaurant. It has a homey feel to it and it was very pleasant. Plus, they show their love for Jesus! I'm down for a place like that."}
{"text":"I went in on a Tuesday and got their special: Turkey Rellano, it was delicious. They use local small business' for their bread, coffee and much more. Those iced coffee is amazing will regularly getting that in the morning! 

The staff was friendly and truly cared about how your meal was. Definitely a hidden little gem."}
{"text":"The staff is so very friendly.They will even customize your order if your calorie counting. The muffins are great as the cookies are! Down home cooking to the max. I have had the monte cristo which was good,just a bit much for my system. I hear the Reuben is really good. Next time.
Bring cash as cards are only accepted in the ATM in the cafe."}
{"text":"Delicious little find in the industrial area near 60 and the 10.  Small business run by a friendly couple with some serious cooking chops and a desire to share good, healthy food.  Their breads/muffins are delicious, the omelette fresh and tasty, and my sausage burro was perfect.  The fresh flavored ice teas were an unexpected surprise, and their coffee was especially good. 

Though small, there was plenty of seating, and an outside are for cooler temps, not cramped in the least.  The decor was appropriate AND encouraging without being kitschy.  

Will definitely be returning, as we appreciate small businesses and attempt to support their integrity in the community.  Thanks, Morningstar! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our way out & had the green chile chicken sandwich which was awesome. The food is great & the owners were very friendly so will definitely come again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. I love the coffee and iced tea. Amazing sourdough toast and my favorite for lunch is the green chili chicken sandwich!!! Owners are friendly , warm and welcoming. Doesn't get better than this! :D"}
{"text":"The coffee is amazing, I agree, but there is so much more that makes Morning Star Cafe the place to patron. This little hidden gem is such a rarity amongst chain breakfast restaurants with the husband-wife duo who specialize in home-cooked quality food and baked goods. They have perfected their omelets and have a variety of amazing sandwiches to satisfy your breakfast or lunch cravings. The pancakes are the perfect harmony of thick and fluffy and you will not leave wanting! Support our local community and patron Morning Star Cafe. Tell all your friends, relatives, and coworkers and make sure they stay around as long as they're willing!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Just moved from
Connecticut, thanks to yelp,  I found this place! Small little spot in an industrial park but spot on with the food. The couple that owns it is sooo friendly and go out of their way to talk to you and they genuinely care. I have been here at least twice a week since I've moved. If you are looking for to get away from the processes chain style food you have to check out their home cooking! I can go on for 30 minutes but I won't! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly, and exceptional... Peter was very nice an actually spoke sincerely when asking questions and talking. Had the special grilled turkey, chili relleno, peperjack, and sauce!

Try this if your in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"The BEST! Not only is the food delicious but the family that owns and operates this business are as kind, courteous, and caring as it gets! Good food and loving on people is their thing."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast AND coffee! Generous portions.  Felt like I was family, exchanging Maui stories with the owner. Wish I lived closer than Tucson so I could eat here more often. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We were traveling in the Tempe area and instead of paying $20 for a breakfast buffet at our hotel, we decided to check this place out.  We were VERY glad that we did.  The food was great, affordable, and the owners were wonderful to visit with.  

I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Watered down milk... nasty pancakes, and way over prized. It was not like this 5 years ago though,  makes me sad."}
{"text":"One of the best omelets I have had in a long time. The Italian was felled with goodness. Owner was really friendly. If you call ahead they will have your order ready."}
{"text":"The french toast was one of the best I have ever had. My boyfriend had a tuna melt and he said it was way good. The prices were really reasonable. The owners were really friendly and you can tell they love their cafe. If I lived in phoenix id be there all the time. Loved it super cozy."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! A breakfast place with breakfast prices. No more paying $9+ for eggs (since when did this become acceptable??). The breakfast menu was $4-6. The lunch menu was $5-7. I ordered the patty melt special ($6.50). It came out quick, was nice n hot and pretty darn good. Staff was friendly and courteous. Tip: cash only."}
{"text":"In town for Spring Break and wanted a good breakfast place for our family. Found this place on Yelp and it is great. Friendly people with great service. Bacon is crispy and good.  Pancakes are also very good.  The coffee is excellent."}
{"text":"Good homemade food. Nothing processed or out of a box. Limited seating and not the best A/C, but still decent. Prices are good too. Great twist on the standard Monte christo sandwich."}
{"text":"By far the best Reuben's I've ever had! The owners are wonderful and truly the reason for the amazing environment. They are very interactive with their customers and show that they care about what they do. Come see them, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a quick bite to eat before class one day, and couldn't have been more impressed! Don't be fooled by the location (pretty industrial), the food is great, the service was impeccable, and the overall experience left me anxious to come back. I immediately regretted not ordering a sandwich to take for lunch, but there was no time! I ordered scrambled eggs, a side pancake, and some toast - all were great. You could probably make a decent meal out of the bread alone. If you're in the area or even the remote vicinity and at all hungry, go!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim before flying home and had a cup of coffee,  a side of sausage patties and a chorizo egg cheese burrito. Everything was delicious. Everyone was very nice and the service was very fast. If I'm ever back in the Phoenix/Tempe area I will definitely make this a stop to eat at again."}
{"text":"I love places that serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Food is good, if not great.  The owners are very friendly.  Portion sizes are large.  They were very accommodating of our children."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing people! Best Chai in town! Sandwiches are fresh and taste great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great hospitality from the owners. Really tucked out of the way, so all locals while we were there. Will definitely dine there again while we're in town."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast place close to the Arizona Grand Resort and found this on Yelp. Tucked in an industrial center, we were pleasantly greeted by the owner and his wife. The breakfast sandwiches were plentiful and delicious... My teenage son gave his the \"thumbs up\". Perfect for the price. Note: I don't see any item over $9 on their menu."}
{"text":"The coffee is AMAZING! In my humble opinion, that is not an overstatement by any means! Now that I got that got of the way, on with my full review! 

 My husband works nearby and always talked about this place, but I hadn't had the pleasure until recently. The moment you walk in the door you are greeted by the warm smells of yummy food and fantastic coffee! After searching the menu I decided on a Monte Cristo. Best one I've had! No, seriously, best ever! My husband had the French toast, which he devoured before I could get a bite! He assures me that it was above par. The owners make you feel so welcome, It's like you're family the minute you cross the threshold. I love, love, love this place and you will too! Now, I think I need to stop by for a visit today. All this talk of Morning Star has my mouth watering!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a place in the middle of an office and light industrial area.  We were greeted by friendly staff as we walked in the door.  We all had egg, cheese, and meat tortilla wraps that were delicious.   We loved the iced tea."}
{"text":"Glad we used Yelp, we would never have found this cafe otherwise. This is located in an industrial park and as many of us know some of the best eateries are off the beaten paths. I ordered the ham, olive, & provolone omelette. Not being very fond of fried potatoes I was pleased to see this omelette didn't come with any, but did come with 4 of the thickest slices of rye toast I've ever been served. Almost 1 inch in thickness. Together this was a filling meal, simple but tasty. My wife ordered the scramble with bacon and she too enjoyed her meal which came with 4 thick slices if wheat toast, she could only finish 3 slices, but totally enjoyed the jam that was served. We'll come back for sure when visiting Tempe!"}
{"text":"Really a nice menu and good food, a true ma and pa place. They run the counter and the Grill"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find while visiting! They don't have an explicit kid's menu but offered pancakes or French toast to my kiddo. The Monte Cristo sandwich was everything promised by other reviews and my wife's breakfast sandwich would have fed two people easily.

Best of all, a very friendly staff with a great atmosphere. So glad we skipped the franchise breakfast places slightly closer to our hotel."}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage and provolone of omelette and it was absolutely incredible my wife had muffeletta and I had to have a bite and that was amazing as well incredibly nice and excellent customer service from the staff def coming back to try everything so happy we found this place hidden gem for sure"}
{"text":"I loved my breakfast there!  I had the two eggs,  toast and bacon.  The bacon was the crispiest and most delicious!  Also the host was very friendly."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, people and ambiance, plus one more for the sweet memories this tiny cafe holds in my heart.  I became based out of Phoenix for a Seattle based company back in 2006.  My new coworker introduced me to this cafe when I first started and their egg sandwich with green chiles.  Wonderful Mom and Pop cafe with wholesome couple owners.  Food is heart-felt, the digs small but comfortable, clean and homey.  Dave loves the stuffed tomato, too.  

The office moved not long after I moved here from Tempe to Chandler which virtually eliminated our visits but I've never forgotten them.  A short several years later, I got moved back to Seattle.  I felt I owed them this review which is an uncommon five stars.  Such a wonderful time of my life that is permanently associated with Morning Star.  Thank you so much."}
{"text":"This place has great coffee. We actually bought some to take home. 
The food was good and we could order anything off the menu (except soup that was not ready until 11:30am). 
I ordered the Ruben and it was delicious. The cheese and bread really made it stand out. 
The Monte Cristo was good too. 
The owner brought us a sample of the soup when it was ready. It was spicy and definitely homemade. 
This place is a little difficult to find but worth the search... 
I suggest bringing cash, but they do have an ATM if needed...."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating was nice. I had an egg sandwich that was grilled well but the bread was not very good. Would have preferred a croissant or bagel. Also they do not provide actual silverware, just plastic forks/knives and styrofoam cups."}
{"text":"A bit surprised when we pulled up to this little spot in the middle of an industrial park, but we decided to give it a try and were glad we did. The breakfast wraps were tasty, as was the french toast. The owners were friendly. A very casual place, but good."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast and lunch spot. Everything is good and the blueberry muffins are amazing."}
{"text":"The owners are super friendly, food is great, and the homemade muffins are addicting (and I usually don't really like muffins haha).  I've been coming here for years.  Bring cash as cards are only accepted in the ATM in the cafe."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough! Love places like this! Everything is made FRESH the same day. Muffins and cookies as well! (I got 2 for tomorrow morning) Our order was correct, came out quickly and every meal was so good!! Thanks for the great service! (Happy 15 year anniversary in November .. yay)"}
{"text":"Morning Star Cafe is a great spot to have breakfast or lunch. The food is good, the owners/workers are friendly and professional, and after coming once, I may just become a regular. Also, the coffee is OUTSTANDING."}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo is amazing!! The atmosphere is just like being at home. The staff is as amazing as the food. We are visiting from LA but we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and coffee. Coffee is made in house and has excellent foam! I ordered the Monte cristo and it was excellent! My boyfriend got an spinach bacon omelette and it was also amazing. It's a mom and pop shop and the owners are incredibly friendly. A worth while experience! I recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Wow is this just a hidden jem. Back on an industrial street. You wouldn't even know it was there unless you worked in the area but do they have really good sandwiches. Sure I have only been twice and not 70 plus times like some people. Lol. My really good friend Cheryl B, the 70 plus timer, has been raving about this place for a while now but it was just a little too far away from my work to go there for lunch. Now that I have more time I was finally able to give it a try. She was right. It is really good. The Tuesday special is a Turkey Relleno sandwich, my fav so far. It is a cross between a turkey sandwich and a chilli relleno, which I didn't realize at first, but wow it is so good. Just the right amount of spice.
The owner, Peter, is either behind the couner or sitting at a table with his wife, who is also part owner, having some of their great food. They are both very nice. The place is not that big. Just a few tables inside and only a couple outside. It is a very nice and clean place. Simple. Nothing too fancy. The food says enough. The prices are very resonable. Especially for how good the food is. Everything was cooked just right and very fresh. Even the bread was amazing. The Patty Melt they have on special on Thursday was also very good. 
If you are in the area definitely stop by and have a sandwich. My recommendation is to go on a Tuesday. Then go a bunch more after that. Why not finish out the week there. I will definitely be back. I want to try the Monte Cristo sandwich next plus all of the rest. A nice little Mom and Pop breakfast and lunch spot. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This cute little cafe was awesome!  Food was delish, and the cute couple that own's it were super friendly and kind!  Would definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably great place...the chorizo and pepper breakfast wrap was sublime. Super fresh ingredients and tortillas from down the road. Homemade salsa was a great adornment. Place is homey and owners were very friendly. This out of the way cafe is worth the effort. Be back tomorrow

Ps even the latte was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back to Phoenix from a short vacation out of town. I was looking for a good sandwich place that was locally owned and a new experience for me and my husband. The yelp reviews led here. I ordered the Monte Cristo and it was as amazing as everyone said it was in the reviews. I will come back for sure to try more off the menu and anytime I have a Monte Cristo craving. The owners were super friendly and you can tell this restaurant is a labor of love."}
{"text":"Awesome omelets, made to order, all day long. We shared a veggie, and the ingredients were fresh, home cooked, tasty, and probably organic. Coffee was piping hot and sported that dark and deep roasted ambiance which perfectly complemented the omelet. And all for under $10!"}
{"text":"I used to work next door to MS.  It is a family owned and operated establishment in a location that has seen it's share of owners.  Due to the location nothing else has seemed to work there.  The owners however take great care to learn their regular customers names and give it that homey feel.  

The food is a little pricey, however, it is well worth the price.  A typical sandwich is about 3 inches thick.  There is nothing that I have eaten there that I did not like.  The deserts are all made on site and they are to die for, true comfort food.  They also do breakfast all day.

My favorite ... their coffee.  Peter, the owner, I believe gets it from Mexico.  It has a caramelized roast so it is strong but never bitter.

I am no longer working in an area that affords me the opportunity to stop in, but when i drive by the Priest exit on 60 I so want to just get off and run in to get some coffee."}
{"text":"Great coffee and omelet. Tried the unique provolone, ham and olive omelet. You can't go wrong by adding olives to anything...very good.  The coffee was my kind of awesome...hot and smooth. 
Very friendly atmosphere...owners just had a grand baby and we're sharing their excitement with everyone. 
The place is in a small industrial building, so I drove by it once, but glad I turned around."}
{"text":"I'm usually the one who takes people to new places they haven't tried before, but today, my good friend invited me to try this place out.  I'd seen this place a million times in my Yelp searches for good food near my place of work, but for some reason, I always skip over it.  I think it's because the main picture of three people clearly not standing in the actual cafe and the \"Caterers, Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch\" description probably led me to think it wasn't a sit down cafe.

Immediately upon entering, I noticed how hot it was in there, and my friend mentioned that they have no air conditioning.  I'm a fat guy, and we don't do well inside non air conditioned small crowded buildings.  I ordered a Ruben for myself and the turkey club for my lady who was back working hard at the office.  We grabbed a table which had a wobble to it and then waited in line to pay for our order.  We almost got skipped in line by someone, but my friend was brave enough to jump in and tell them we were next.  I could see the confusion though and if you haven't been there, you order on the right, and then pay on the left, BUT if there's a line on the left, get in it, don't jump over to your left.  Better yet, order ahead.

Once we paid, the food came out fairly quickly.  The owner brought it out himself, but, upon setting down our sandwiches, he proceeded to blame us for \"moving the table\" off of the napkin he had used to eliminate the wobble.  The Ruben was very good, good enough for me to not be completely annoyed by being accused of rearranging furniture causing it to wobble.  Fix the table and maybe don't blame people for moving it off the napkin.  That's all I'm saying.

Anyway, I'll be back for sure to try other menu items.  The salads looked amazing and HUGE and my lady liked the turkey club I brought back for her.

I'm often annoyed to see so many 5 star reviews for places here on Yelp.  I reserve 5 stars for places and food that is out of this world amazing.  This is a sandwich shop.  I give this place a SOLID three stars, taking off one for the fact that there is no air conditioning.  The other suites in the office park had wall mounted A/C units, probably wouldn't hurt to spend the $100 on one for the cafe.  The food is good but also a bit pricey for what it is.  I paid $15 for two sandwiches and an iced tea.

All in all, if you're in the mood for a really good sandwich, and don't mind the heat, come here and check them out!  I'm glad my friend brought me here."}
{"text":"Welcoming, friendly, excellent service. Delicious, fresh food. Enjoyed a fantastic omelet and the perfect classic tuna melt."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast wrap with chorizo and chilies! So good and the salsa was on point!"}
{"text":"This quaint restaurant is located in an industrial park.  It is a little hard to find but worth your search.  I had the two egg breakfast with wheat toast and sausage.  The wheat bread is homemade and sliced thick. It was absolutely delicious. The owners were very friendly and greeted everyone with a smile as they walked through the door.  The only drawback to this place is they only take cash but they have an ATM on-site.  I will definitely be back when I return to the area."}
{"text":"One of the things Boyfriend and I try to do when we're on vacation is to find local restaurants to try out. I mean, what's the point of hitting up a chain restaurant we could easily find in our own town when there are usually awesome places to explore and local economies to support? We usually start by using Yelp to find places nearby that have good ratings, and this one came up first on the list.

We had some trouble finding the restaurant, which was really more down to Boyfriend's mistyping of the address into his GPS than the location of the building. It is in a bit of a strange place for a cafe, tucked in a fairly industrial neighborhood with very little other commercial property around, but I'm sure they make good money from the officefolk coming in for lunch breaks. Not a bad strategy, really.

All the non-vegetarians (meaning the three people there who weren't me) ordered Monte Cristos. If a restaurant serves one of those, you can pretty much bank on Boyfriend trying it at least once. I ordered an egg sandwich, myself, and when the owner heard I was a vegetarian he offered to add some extra vegetables to the sandwich so it wouldn't be boring.

The Montes were a big hit with everyone else, and based on the other reviews here, I'd say ordering one is a pretty safe bet. My egg sandwich was also delicious, and more than filling enough for breakfast. We liked the place so much that we came back two days later.

Two more Monte Cristos made their way into the bellies of my cohorts, including Boyfriend again. My sister's husband got a breakfast burrito, and I opted for a plate of French toast. When they say the French toast is big, they MEAN it. Three huge slices of Texas toast, dipped in batter and fried to golden perfection. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Again, everyone was pleased with their meals.

I was the only person who had coffee while we were there, and while I don't necessarily agree with the people who rave about it being the best in town, it was definitely not bad. I ordered it both days, which I wouldn't have done if I'd hated it.

As for the atmosphere, it's definitely a little more Team Jesus than I'd like. I'm not a huge fan of people using their businesses to promote their spiritual beliefs, no matter what religious text they choose to read, so being surrounded by Bible verses and crosses was a little bit uncomfortable for me. However, the good food balanced that out, and the owners were both super friendly and talkative, engaging us in conversation the first day and welcoming us warmly the second day. For good, veg-friendly food and nice people, I could probably put up with just about any decor."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love this place for MANY reasons.
For starters, Peggy & Peter are genuinely amazing people and amazing cooks. Such a welcoming at home feeling each time.

 I have literally had everything on the menu, and have not had anything I didn't like. Decent prices, and larger portions. They are very close to my job, we have order as a group and I have often ordered individually. I highly recommend this place; you WILL NOT BE disappointed."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find such a place in the industrial district, but it was a lucky choice.  The veggie omelette was large and scrumptious, and the coffee top-notch.  The owners really make this place stand out, though. A very pleasant visit overall."}
{"text":"This place is great!!

Tucked away in Tempe, I actually found this place w/ the Yelp app on my phone. My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast and LOVED it!

The place is quaint... the food is EXCELLENT. 
BEST. COFFEE. EVER. We drink it black, so we are partial to good coffee :)

We got a chance to speak to the owners, and they were as nice as can be! Helpful and made our breakfast very pleasant. 

All in all - Above expectations. We have already begun recommending it to guests at the hotel we work at. And we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, great food, great atmosphere.
Highly recommended..

The egg breakfast dishes are excellent along with sandwiches and wraps.  The Monty Cristo is a wonderful sandwich, it's on a really good French toast, made just right for the sandwich, bacon, ham, cheese.. highly recommend."}
{"text":"I eat here Every Tuesday for Turkey Relleno Tuesday !  The best sandwich I have ever had period. Thank you for your quality food and Awesome Service. Cheers"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is delicious, the portions are big and the prices are very reasonable!!! Customer services is been the best so far in our visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"0830 on a Monday. A quiet little spot hidden away from busy Tempe. All freshly made foods. Triple berry muffin very good, packed with berries. Thick sourdough toast, good quality bacon, and tastey eggs. Most definitely returning. Fast and kind service."}
{"text":"Probably the best Rueben I have ever had. The morning star is definitely in an odd place, but well worth finding. Great staff and really good food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Denver Omelette and my boyfriend ordered the Monte Cristo. My omelette was a little dry but his Monte Cristo served with strawberry jam was delicious! For both meals and a cup of coffee cost about $16, which is very affordable. If I lived in the area I would definitely go back. The staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Monte Christo may give you immediate heart attack, but probably worth it. People were pleasant.  It's basically located in an office park."}
{"text":"This is a great cafe, owners are hands on and very pleasant to talk to. The food is fantastic and all home made with quality ingredients. Definitely recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"What a cool place. Cute decor, and the owners are so nice and welcoming. What a great breakfast at a great price. We had the Monte Christo and the Traditional 2-Egg breakfast and both were outstanding. On vacation from Chicago and while we want to try a lot of places we already decided that we're going back for breakfast tomorrow :)! Highly recommend this classic \"hole in the wall\" location if you want a great breakfast with great people. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  This place has the best reuben sandwich!  It's the ultimate comfort food and they have the most friendly owners; perfect for a rough day.  They really care for their customers by engaging in real & intentional conversation."}
{"text":"Used to work right next door and was able to go every morning. Ahhh it was bliss. They have the greatest sandwiches in town. I used to drive across town when I wasn't working to get their monte cristo. Come here if you want to be blown away."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food and feeling. 

Not a wide variety on the menu but that's just fine!  

Home cooked meals, bread, baked sweets!

Atmosphere is if \"grandmas\" house but without the dust and clutter!  Will be back every time I'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"A small, local place located in a semi industrial area. Clean and operated by the owners. They are very friendly and accommodating. 
The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. 
We're in town as tourists and this is off the beaten tourist path but it's with the visit to try and see someplace that caters to a local clientele.  A nice local spot and with a visit!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast at 7:40 on a Monday. Wasn't crowded, service was very quick and professional. There is seating inside for about 30. Given coffee as soon as I ordered, always nice if you need coffee first. I got the grilled egg sandwich w/ bacon. So delicious! Eggs well cooked and nicely seasoned, bread is a beautiful soft roll-like bread. Two slices of cheese on top and bottom. Perfectly cooked delicious bacon folded into the egg.

As others have said, keep your eyes out for it, it can be hidden by the trucks that park out front along the road. Very clean and well kept. I'm usually turned off by religious/God references in places but these are subtle and not in your face. 

Very satisfying and a perfect start to my day, thank you yelpers!"}
{"text":"Ok so we are here on business and we decide to find a good breakfast spot. Well we found it! This place is legit!! Had there monte cristo breakfast sandwich, trust me you will love it. Very friendly couple running the place and they are very nice. Good job!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here several times and never had something I didn't love. Anything for breakfast is great, but their breakfast sandwiches and coffee are incredible. For lunch, get the Reuben or the special.

One of the best breakfast places around, the coffee is SPECTACULAR and their egg sandwiches are to die for. There is nothing else in the area that rivals their food."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick brunch before game time at 4:00. We're staying here for the NIKE TOC and if you know anything about feeding hungry teenage girls.... It can be a task at times. This place wasn't very busy but got pretty packed around noon. The food came out fast and the service was excellent 

Good prices. Excellent company. Small, self owned business. (Christ centered as well) if that's something you're into.

I would recommend the chorizo wrap.. But I know my kids had pancakes and other breakfast things... Along the green chili chicken sandwich! 

Overall great experience and looking forward to coming back maybe on our trip and even next year!! (Because we will be back)"}
{"text":"We were on our last day of our vacation and looking for a last meal before heading to the airport. I checked yelp for restaurants that were currently open nearby and thankfully discovered the Morning Star Cafe. It is in a mostly industrial location that you would never just \"stumble upon\".  We walked in to a very cute cafe and were immediately greeted by the owner, offered coffee and given a menu. It was about 10 am, but neither one of us really wanted breakfast and asked if we could get one of the sandwiches offered. No problem at all, order anything you want! So, I ordered a turkey on rye, my husband got a muffaletta. 

While we were waiting, the owner chatted us up a bit, asked a few questions, discovered that we were from out of town. She told us about her favorite places in AZ and even brought over some of her favorite magazines outlining things to do in the area (we are already planning our next trip back!). Very friendly! I can't even comprehend the complaints about the service being nil. There were a couple of other tables and each was treated with the same warm service that we were.

Our food came, and it was delicious. It is kind of hard to make something fantastic out of the common turkey sandwich, but they pull it off. The bread is about an inch thick, perfectly fresh and soft (delivered nightly by a company just a couple buildings down as told to us by the owner), lots of fresh veggies are offered with the turkey (to order, of course). My husband's muffaletta was perfect. Just the right about of olive salad. The coffee was fantastic too (as others have mentioned). As we were paying our bill (which was very reasonable), the owner gave us a little bag with a couple of their fresh muffins to enjoy on the plane since she knew we were headed out! One blueberry and one cinnamon, they were a perfect mid-flight snack. 

So, I would hands down recommend Morning Star Cafe. This is the sort of place that I would visit on the regular if I lived locally. I am sure that I would be greeted by name and be handed a warm cup of coffee as I came in the door, it is that type of place. I love the fact that it is family owned, they have a guest book which starts with an entry detailing that this cafe has been a long time dream of theirs and describing all of the work putting the place together.  The cute decor was done by their friends and family, rewarded by home cooked meals . There is an obvious pride and love for their work that is often missing from your typical corporate chain that is so common in the Phoenix area (and any other city for that matter). If you are in the area, plug the address into your GPS and stop by, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick breakfast before heading back home to DC.  A Great place!  Friendly service, awesome food and quick too!   Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm coming here every morning for breakfast"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Morning Star Cafe, a friend told me about it or I might not have discovered this hidden slice of heaven  that serves breakfast, lunch and homemade desserts located in an unlikely area tucked in between business offices in Tempe. We both ordered the Tuesday special, the Turkey Relleno sandwich, made with their fresh sourdough bread, tasty turkey and melted cheese! It was not just the best Turkey sandwich but the best sandwich I ever had! The bread was so good she placed an order for pick up on Friday for 2 loaves to share and enjoy over the weekend. We also ordered their fresh baked oatmeal apple square to split but  both of us were so full from our sandwiches that it had to wait. Lucky for me I took it back to the office and later, yes I ate the whole gosh dang thing myself. The owner brought our food to the table and it was obvious that he valued good service as much a the greatness of the food he served. I took a menu with me and on Friday called to order a Chicken Chili sandwich to go,  which did not disappoint! I have already made plans to go again with a coworker next week, if I can wait that long, their 5 cheese grilled sandwhich is calling my name! 
The only down side is that they're only open Monday through Friday 6am until 3pm, but I'm hoping to make it for breakfast and coffee soon. If you're in the area or even if your not it's worth the drive and a definite must try, again and again and again.
PS Bring cash, they don't take cards but they do have an ATM machine inside to accomodate you in case you forget."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in a semi industrial area of Tempe.  Hey


A simple but homemade menu with excellent service and a cozy environment.  Fresh sandwiches, soup, and baked goods are what you can expect to find at the small café. The owners are very kind and personable.  They clearly care about their café, their customers, and community. After ordering I noticed a small hand written sign at the counter indicating that anyone who will be spending Thanksgiving alone is welcome to come and join them for dinner at the café which they will provide at no charge (donations accepted but not required)- that shows care and commitment to the community.  My first visit was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"A very good monte cristo and a nice owner. 

For food alone, this place is a nice four stars. But it feels weird in there - a square, all white room with cheap furniture... it didn't feel like a comfortable, cozy breakfast place to me at all.  It felt like a to-go stand with a bit of extra room. Hence, the 3-star.

Would I go again? Yeah, if I were nearby and wanted a quick bite. Would I go out of my way for it? Much as I enjoyed my meal and the staff I met, I have to say I probably wouldn't unless they upgraded to new digs."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been there several times and the food/service is always awesome. The bread they serve is the best I've ever tasted, the portions are huge considering their modest pricing, and the couple that runs it are always pleasant. They obviously take pride in what they do, and rightfully so. They're my favorite breakfast/ brunch spot."}
{"text":"Wow - what an impressive breakfast. This is a small cafe located in a office oriented strip mall. Don't drive past! My wife said her latte was the best one she's ever had. We each ordered the chorizo breakfast wrap and we both loved it. The ambiance is has a country charm and makes you feel at home. We live in a different state, but will likely be back when we visit again."}
{"text":"The best Monte Cristo I've ever had the Swiss is super strong Swiss crispy bacon good turkey great job guys"}
{"text":"I frequent this place for lunch since it is close to my work.  Extremely glad I found it since there are not many decent and quick places to eat in the area. I have to comment on how nice everyone is and they definitely make it a point to remember you.  I even forgot my wallet once and they just gave me the sandwich anyway, the owner said he didn't want me to waste my lunch hour driving back to the office to get it- I made it a point to go back the next day and pay for it. 

They have the best wheat bread; thick and soft slices.  I am a turkey sandwich kind of girl and they never disappoint. Their bakery selections are just like grandma used to make.  The soups seem to be pretty healthy because they are all homemade.  Their hot sandwiches seem to be pretty yummy too- my bf always goes for them."}
{"text":"Great spot, off the beaten path, but good was delicious. I had a huge omelette with fresh ingredients. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food great people! Came for bfast and everything was tasty. Good for lunch too."}
{"text":"Eating here for first time, I had monte Cristo which was very good, not deep fried or with powdered sugar but good none the less! Hubby had cheese steak it was hot and very good! Both were big enough to fill us up!! May consider trying again when we are in area! Owners were friendly, food was reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today because of the excellent reviews. The owners were very welcoming and I enjoyed chatting with them. They suggested the Monte Cristo and Turkey Relleno, Tuesday special. Both sandwiches were delicious. The Cristo was a perfect mix of savory and sweet and the Turkey relleno melts in your mouth. Ask for syrup with the Turkey Relleno. It might sound strange, but it's so goood!"}
{"text":"So thrilled we happened upon this place. The bread was beyond good because it's handmade from the factory across the street. I had sourdough with jam and gah it was just so good!! The couple from Minnesota that seem to run the place are darling and happy to chat. We really liked getting to know them. The bacon was also phenomenal. A really sweet place!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times already and love it!  I love the food, the environment, and the owners are so personable.  I would highly recommend even though the location is in an interesting spot."}
{"text":"Peter and Peggy are extremely welcoming! Great food at a good price and an amazing Tuesday Sandwich that is definitely worth showing up for!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and had a wonderful experience and the food was delicious. Definitely recommend this place and I will most certainly be coming back. Customer service from the owners was delightful!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place that has really delish breakfast food. Food is very fresh, well-prepared and very generous.  We had the grilled egg sandwich. I got tomato and spinach instead of meat. Hubbie got the spinach, bacon and Swiss cheese omelette that came with two slices of thick-slices light rye. Sooooo good. Coffee is good and green tea came in a nice big mug. Highly recommend this place. Oh, and the owners are super nice too! 
Came back for more today. It's been a year because we live on the east coast, otherwise we'd be regulars! I ate a beautiful, enormous and fresh spinach salad topped with bacon and hard-boiled egg. Husband had a homemade cherry turnover, spinach, bacon, and Swiss omelet. Son ate the ham, provolone and olive omelet. Omelets were huge, cooked to perfection and came with 4 thick-slices of toast. This place is a little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a Monday morning, we were visiting from out of state so positive Yelp reviews and proximity to our hotel lead us here.  The cafe is located in an industrial part of town, so you may think your Google maps lead you astray, fear not, keep your eyes peeled and you'll see it!  The cafe was quaint with several pieces of \"homey\" decor and a Christian theme.  The owners were very friendly and easily engaged in conversation.  We ordered eggs, sausage, the Denver omelet, toast, and pancakes.  The quality of the pancakes over shadowed all the other food.  Melt in your mouth deliciousness!  Tempting looking pastries were on display and as the menu reads are homemade.  The coffee was hot and strong. Be prepared to order at the counter, pay ahead, eat with plastic utensils, and there's a guestbook that you'll be encouraged to sign."}
{"text":"Coffee is the best!! Also, for lunch, the green chili sandwich. Ive been coming here for a few years now and have no complaints. My favorite morning spot."}
{"text":"I've been here twice early in the morning and every time I come in, the muffins are fresh still warm and the owners are always so nice. I have only ever gotten the Ruben and a muffin, they are amazing. Good portion, fresh bread, flavor is good and the cheese is plentiful!"}
{"text":"Best Reuben I've ever had. Not exaggerating. We didn't see the restaurant at first, because of its location, but after we got inside, there was quick service and great food. 
It's run by some down to earth people, give it a try."}
{"text":"Peggy & Peter are wonderful! Great quality, great tasting & great service. Always enjoy eating at Morning Star."}
{"text":"First time here. Andrew and I are always on the lookout for a good breakfast spot. Since Max's cozy kitchen closed years ago...we really haven't found any place that had the same home kitchen ambiance, a place where we could take the girls, on a regular basis. We found that place today...we will be back. The food was delicious...I had the Italian omelet, very tasty and huge portion. The owner greeted and spoke with EVERY customer...don't let the appearance from the outside fool you! Go in and sit a spell."}
{"text":"when I moved here from san diego I knew I would miss my fav breakfast spot as they had the best monte Christo sandwich around.  so I googled monte Christo and found the Morning Star café.  good sandwich and the prices are great cant wait to try the other items on the menu.  Oh, they take credit cards and cash."}
{"text":"Looked up some breakfast places in Tempe, surprisingly there are not that many. This little Cafe is so charming you would never think it rest in the industrial park. 

Walked in and immediately greeted by the owner with a huge smile! The menu has a variation of creative dishes as well as common favorites. The owner suggested a white tea with my breakfast sandwich and I was sold. 

The wait was not long at all and the food was served within a few minutes. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was a good helping of food. My friend got an omlete and it looked delicious as well. 

Overall great experience and a great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"This was the best sandwich I have ever had!! Quaint place, friendly owners, fabulous food.. I had a turkey relleno grilled sandwich from HEAVEN!!  If I lived here, I would eat here daily!! Great chocolate cake too!!  If I could give them a 10, I would!!  It is off the best and path, but worth finding!  I'm from Texas and I would love to find a place that has a sandwich like this!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast after reading good things and ended up driving to the other side of Tempe to try it out one morning before class.  I ordered the Monte Cristo with a side of bacon.

The food is probably closer to 3.5-4 stars.  The Monte Cristo was actually really, really good - probably one of the best I've ever had.  It was perfectly sweet and just a bit savory and very fresh.  The bacon was good too, though just a hair under how I like mine cooked.

They brag about having some of the best coffee in town.  Nope.  It's crap.  I mean, we're not talking about drive-thru coffee, but it's at best standard diner coffee.  Two stars on the Joe.

Prices were average.

The ambiance, at least for me, is a one star.  Maybe 1.5 if I'm feeling generous.  I can't decide if it felt like I was eating at an old lady's house or a church waiting room.  The place is Jesused-out.  I'm not religious, but I don't really mind religion either - I just don't like sitting down to Coffee with Christ.  The whole meal felt like it was served in the green room for the 700 Club.  I guess that shouldn't have surprised me since the restaurant's website links to RBC Ministries.  The whole thing was just way too overbearing to be cozy at all.  Even my super-religious friends would probably wonder where the restaurant was.  Between that and the constant interruptions from the staff, my working breakfast was thoroughly thwarted.

Basically, really good food, meh-to-blah coffee, and a very uncomfortable dining room."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem.  Food was amazing and the staff treats you like family.  Brought some books over for my kids to read while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food tastes just like home with huge portions. ( I had to split my egg sandwich into two meals) Their muffins are to die for, super mosit full of flavor, and have a crisp muffin top. Iced coffe was perfect. When we walked in we where treated just like family which is such a lovely feeling.  It was such an amazing experience.  I will defiantly be making regular trips back here.  Thank you guys so much for a wonderful meal served with love."}
{"text":"We stopped by Morning Star Cafe for a quick lunch.  It is in an unassuming location but the sandwiches are AWESOME!  The sandwiches were big and I got to try the patty melt, tuna melt and Reuben.  They were all super good."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way out to the airport. Cute, unassuming place in an industrial park.  Super friendly, easy, great service, good breakfast.  We'll be back-"}
{"text":"I thought this place was so cute for a fast bite to eat! The owners are super sweet and I love how quick the service is. I got an order of French toast and ate the entire thing in under five minutes, pretty sure I gave the owner a heart attack! Delicious coffee also, don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Great little Cafe..tucked away in an industrial area..awesome fresh baked goods..I had the Monte Cristo and it was very good..needed a little sweetness in the bread to go with the French toast, something like the McGriddle..quality food priced well..4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful little mom and pop cafe. Wonderful setting and relaxing environment. Owners are amazing, scripture on the walls, such a nice little place. Food was fantastic, definitely get the bang for your buck. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We make it a point to stop by every year we're in town for Spring Training. The couple who runs it make it a great place to start the day. They're personable and friendly, and you just don't get this kind of service most places. If you're anywhere nearby looking for breakfast or lunch, go out of your way to stop by here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"In town for the day and was looking for a local spot. I'm very happy I found Morning Star. Although situated in an industrial part of town, it's very homy, inviting and comfortable. The prices are reasonable and portions are good. Food is made to order but comes out quickly. Great coffee and pastries as well. Best of all the owners are really friendly and accommodating. I'd definitely return when back in Tempe."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go, especially on a Tuesday for their turkey relleno sandwich (a hybrid monte cristo). Service is fantastic, the owners seem to really care about their food and their customers."}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for some lunch... My lovely wife says that she wants a tuna melt. I punch it into Yelp and Morning Star Cafe' pops up number one.

I really have only one thing to say about this place...

BEST F'N'TUNA MELT I HAVE EVER HAD!

That is all."}
{"text":"Just want to say we stopped to have breakfast here after reading reviews. Food is really good, with amazing service from owners who are more than happy to a accommodate table arrangements since place is small but well with stopping by."}
{"text":"Was in town for Angels spring training. This place was right around the corner and rated well. Food was great and so was the coffee. Staff was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"There I was, alone and hungry. On my long drive before work I felt my stomach drop, it needed food immediately. I had no where to turn. Out of no where I saw a glowing sign that reveled the words \"open\" I walked into Morning star cafe I didn't know what to think at first but then I was greeted with a smile and an offer for a hot cup of joe. I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with wheat toast and sausage.  Not to mention for a very reasonable price. Looking around I could see that this place felt like home. There were customers laughing and having a great time as if they never left. I took my first bite of food and was amazed. Everything was perfect. The cook was extremely nice as well as the cashier. When I'm on another adventure I will surely come back and fulfill my destiny to feed my stomach at morning star cafe."}
{"text":"Thank you Siri and Yelp for this hole in the wall Gem!!! I'm not a local resident and I will be back anytime I'm in the area!!!"}
{"text":"I am a truck driver and I was delivering a load to Safeway distribution and saw this place across the street.  We went there and the food was great so we're the owners. It was one of the best sandwich I ever had."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with good food.  Had the vegetable omelet that was packed with goodies.  The owners are there..:both super kind and helpful.  Worth the visit"}
{"text":"Dropped in for breakfast at around 8:45 and the place was empty.  Good for me, bad for them I suppose.  When you walk in the the first thing you are struck by is how unlike the inside is the to the outside.  From the outside Morning Star looks like any old breakfast/lunch shack jammed into an industrial park mainly to cater to the employees of the various surrounding businesses, but the inside actually reminds me of an old time breakfast joint replete with funny old time signs strewn about declaring how wonderful their fresh brewed coffee is.

I ordered the Italian omelet with an iced tea.  The first thing to point out is that Morning Star does not accept credit or debit cards.  They do, however, have an ATM conveniently located next to the register.  Luckily I had cash so this wasn't an issue, but I can imagine that first timers who hold up the line during the lunch rush could be on the wrong end of some dirty looks.  The omelet was fantastic, it was absolutely bursting with with tomatoes, marinara sauce, cheese, and Italian spices.  The wheat toast was thick sliced and the bread was made that morning, though not on site.

The owners, a married couple, were extremely pleasant to chat with and while I write this I regret not learning their names.

Overall I have to say that I'm sold on this place.  If I wasn't moving out of state in the next few weeks this would definitely be my short-drive breakfast place of choice."}
{"text":"Love this place. I stick to the specials on the board... U can't go wrong.
Never tried the coffee because I am too much of a coffee snob and rarely do I enjoy a coffee outside of my own kitchen. As for the sandwiches, they do it right. Homemade bread all around. Top picks: patty melt,  ruben, monte cristo, chicken w/ green chilies."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. I made it clear it was my first time here and the lady taking my order explained the menu to me. Food was excellent I ordered the Monte Cristo, it was delicious.  The location is a little strange and yelp made it easy to get too."}
{"text":"Great food & warm atmosphere... the owner was wonderful and inviting. Loved our experience!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not as amazing as I anticipated from all the 5-star reviews. Very friendly owners. The food was fine."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled across this place and we are so happy we did.  Everything is amazing! I try something new every time and have yet to let down.  I almost avoid telling people about this place because I never want to have to wait in a line for all the great food and service."}
{"text":"This place is counter service with no breakfast potatoes on the menu. We asked for well done bacon and got well done eggs, medium chewy bacon. Not what we were expecting from the reviews. Probably would not return."}
{"text":"CHARMING!

Our group stopped here on our way to downtown Phoenix. 24 hour breakfast and daily speacials gave us life!

It was really a home away from home. Ms. Peggy served us delicious food and unbeatable quality service.

Don't forget to sign the guest book in the back!!

Be well,
Hawaiian Traveler"}
{"text":"Felt like sitting down at grandmas house for breakfast. My two year old and I read an ispy book while we waited for breakfast. Love this place, wish I would have found it years ago. 
It's a little hidden and I would have never thought to look for it in such an industrial neighborhood. It's located right behind Tempe dairy."}
{"text":"Great Service and great food, you may think $7 for an awesome sandwich is a little high but that is because they don't compromise on quality and portion size.  I usually have my one sandwich for lunch for two days because it is that big! Peggy bakes all the muffins, cookie, turnovers etc DAILY and they couldn't be better.  I highly recommend and tell everyone about them.  Also even though they are a Christian business with religious decor they are not at all pushy about it.  As an agnostic I have always felt comfortable."}
{"text":"Nice owners, the coffee is really weird.. has an aftertaste. Bread good - egg and ham was poor. I picked the wrong items on the menu."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast when we got into town. The owners were very friendly and honest about what they provided \"put their marketing budget into the food\". Our food came out hot and fresh, no thrills just good food. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great little place! The food was awesome, the service was great. The coffee was served in a coffee mug like mom pulled it out of the cupboard to pour you a cup. I only wish they were open weekends :) we will definitely be back, cause I need to try the Monte Christo..."}
{"text":"The food was good and prepared with care. The atmosphere was a little odd and while I didn't see any of the behavior talked about in other comments, it did seem like the owner would offer his opinion on anything if you wanted to listen, we didn't so it wasn't a problem. Coffee was great, my wife and I will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during a conference at the Double Tree.  I chose it based on the reviews and I was not disappointed.   The owner assured me it'd be the best Reuben I've had and he was right.  Very nice owners, fast and friendly service, and definitely worthy of more visits in the future."}
{"text":"Cute place for breakfast or lunch 
Food was delicious 
Owners are sweet and very friendly"}
{"text":"Great place for a \"made from scratch\" breakfast in the early hours of the day.  Highly suggest getting the Monte Crisco, you won't be disappointed.  They are open till 3pm, so grab lunch here as well!"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Literally, a small mom and pop restaurant in an industrial park/business center. It wasn't hard to find and there's plenty of parking. Usually there's no parking in a business center. It has a very cozy and homey feel. There's portraits on the wall as well as decorations, books, board games, and etc. that you can enjoy. They also sell homemade cards and scrapbooks as well as homemade granola bars? The owner showed me a scrapbook that his wife made with his children's picture and memories inside. It was very nice and sweet! You should definitely check it out if you're looking to buy a scrapbook. (:

The owner is very friendly and sweet. I ordered a roast beef and a corn beef sandwich with everything (pickles, bell peppers, onions, and alfalfa sprouts). You can decide your choice of bread, whether you want it toasted, and your choice of cheese. The sandwiches are huge! I was expecting to get a small sandwich like the ones you get at Panera. It was flavorful and delicious and I was full after eating half of it. 

I asked for a box to put the sandwiches in and the owner wrapped them up nicely individually and put it in a bag with \"thank you\" stamped on the outside. Seeing this small gesture really made my day because it really shows that they care about their customers. It's the little things that counts. I just thought it was really sweet.

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone. If you're on the go, you can call in to order so that you can avoid the wait. One thing that I would like to see them improve in the future is that they will be able to make their own meats, that would be totally awesome and I can see this business really sky rocket.

Try it out! It's as good as they all say it is (:"}
{"text":"Cute place, nice people and good food. I like how it's tucked away so there's always parking and no traffic or crowds."}
{"text":"I think I just had the best bacon, spinach and tomato omelette ever. As a self proclaimed omelette expert, I feel confident in my assessment.  The omelette had at least three eggs and a giant pile of perfectly sautéed spinach and tomatoes with fresh cooked thick bacon nicely diced inside. The eggs were perfectly cooked and  hot when it came to the table. The rye toast was thick and buttery.  Coffee here is incredible.  The owners were very nice folks - told me they have been here for 14 years and get their coffee roasted fresh weekly and bread delivered daily. The focus on quality and attentive service is quite apparent.  

I'll be back and encourage you to try it."}
{"text":"A nice hole in the wall restaurant. The bread was really good but besides that I wasn't really impressed by any of the other items I got (eggs, sausage, white chocolate muffin). The place is pretty affordable though so if I'm ever in the area I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and the service is great! The prices are very reasonable for the portions. My omelette filled up over half of the plate! Thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Loved this little quiet cafe, great food and service!  Especially loved what I found on my to go paper bag!  We need more of this in our world today"}
{"text":"Morning Star Cafe...I Love This Place.

This is your typical, but not so typical Mom 'N' Pop Deli.  The food is always fresh and creative and the specials are top notch.  I have never had a bad experience or meal at Morning Star.  Each day they serve a different special and I suggest you try all of them.  My personal favorite is the Turkey Relleno Grilled Sandwich which is served on Tuesdays.

They do more than lunch too.  Their breakfast's are also very good (check out the pictures).

This is a small place located in an industrial area; so, don't be surprised by its location.  You can eat inside or out side at one of a few select tables.

This is a fun place to find and the food is well worth the adventure!  Do yourselves a favor and check them out...Support The Small Local Guys!"}
{"text":"Prepare to have your taste buds delighted and comforted by a menu made with love and service inspired to please you and your family. 

Right as we entered the owner greeted us with a smile and the kind suggestion of a few entrees which sounded amazing. The Monte Cristo and chorizo and green chili wrap were delicious.  The Monte Cristo was wonderful, grilled to maintain a even balance of crisp egg and bread along with fresh melted cheese and ham. So soft and delicious to the last bite.  I would strongly recommend this place because of it's loving environment and heathy options made with high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The owner is a racist.  That's right, I used the \"R\" word because he used the \"N\" word in my presence.  I went for breakfast with my boyfriend and the owner began talking to us about where we were from originally and felt it appropriate to tell use he lived in \"Lousiana\"  (emphasis on the word, lousy) and then began to tell us why he thought it was lousy.  He lost me after he brought up \"all the black people\" and yes, used the \"N\" word.  Yes, that \"N\" word.  

I don't know why this man felt he could be so candid with us, but I gotta imagine-if this is his public face I'd hate to see what he's like as a person.  The most baffling thing to me is the place is covered in his Christian beliefs-it's everywhere-normally a turn off for me but the food is decent.  How can such a \"devout\" Christian be such a hypocrite...and therein lies my rant of how super duper Christian folk usually turn out to be \"not so\" Christian.

Appalling.  That's all I have to say.  His daughter is very nice-hopefully she hasn't picked up the same beliefs as he has, or at least she is smart enough not to broadcast them."}
{"text":"I've worked near this place for years and it never gets old.  I love telling people about this hidden gem and then they too become instant fans.  My favorite breakfast is the egg burrito because the tortilla is authentic and fresh.  My favorite lunch is the tuna melt because well, sometimes simple is just as delicious."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to try this place for breakfast on a whim.  Located in a small business park in a larger industrial area the cafe is unassuming from the outside but upon entering the decor is reminiscent of a Midwestern bakery; quotes are painted on the walls and a hearty bookshelf is chock full of interesting reads.  

The staff was friendly and efficient with the order at the counter.  I ordered the chorizo and chiles wrap with a side of sourdough toast.   Order was quickly turned around and it was great to see a Square terminal for the transaction.  

Food was hearty and piping hot.  A thin flour burrito wrapped the filling which was nice because it was a ton of food.  Homemade salsa was flavorful but not spicy (would have liked more spice but still good).  Toast was buttered with a surgical precision, thick cut slices were overflowing on the plate.  

Proprietors were talkative and cheerful as they made their rounds.  Definitely a locals only type of place but happy to feel like I was included in on the secret. 

definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm always working when this place is open so I was excited to try it on a day I was off.  My sandwich was ok I got a turkey cranberry and the bread was just ok. Not enough meat for my taste, but fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Morning Star Cafe is a quaint Mom & Pop sandwich shop that is very close to my place of employment. I only noticed it recently after seeing my fellow Yelp Elite friend Cheryl S. frequenting.  I figured with over 40 check -ins the food must be good. She and I met here for lunch on a Tuesday and had the Tuesday Special which is the turkey rellano, which I enjoyed and will return to have again. This is a gem tucked in a business park area. If you're in Tempe during the weekday lunch hour go check it out it's worth it."}
{"text":"Had the Tuesday Turkey Rellenos sandwhich special and it was delicious.  Owners behind the counter very friendly and I will be back for another sandwich.  Fast, fresh and hot.  Excellent place and will be back."}
{"text":"Had a chance to try this place yesterday. Had a scrumptious breakfast sandwich. Bread fresh and soft. Food served hot.  Tasty coffee too. I'm going back tomorrow it was so good! Nice people...locally owned."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and coffee!  Found this little gem a couple of years ago and when I'm in the area, I always stop for at least a coffee and some to take home to brew later!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here. It's family owned and they were extremely friendly and made a great recommendation. The sweet Italian and grilled cheese were both delicious."}
{"text":"I just tried this place today after scoping it out on yelp and seeing all of the good reviews.  Morning star is actually just down the street from my house, so it is incredibly convenient to get to and easy to find.  The place wasn't PACKED but certainly had a good amount of customers coming in and out; a good sign that this place is know for good lunch time fare.  I decided on the green chili chicken sandwich and boy was I not disappointed.  If you love green chilies like I do, this is your dish!  Just the right amount of spiciness, certainly not overwhelming.  The quality of ingredients were high, fresh bread and juicy chicken.  Best of all, the prices are really reasonable!  

I believe I met the owner and found him to be really sincere and excited about his business.  I loved the mom and pops feel of this place, and I can't wait to come back and try out breakfast sometime.  

My only \"dislike\" was the coffee; it wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly was nothing exceptional.  It was really nice for the owner to give me a free cup so that I could try it out.  

This place just gave me a good feeling all around.  It's a place I'm happy to support."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but what made this place so good was the friendly people. It is a mom and pop business where you order your food from the counter and then they bring it out to you. The owners really care about their customers and if you have any issues they will correct it.I got the Monte Crisco and I have had better but still good.   Great people, great atmosphere, decent food, not bad price."}
{"text":"Great lil family restaurant.  Cozy atmosphere.  The owner makes sure he talks to every customer and with a sense of humor.  I had the Italian Omelette.  Sautéed zucchini, marinara sauce parmigiana cheese and sliced tomatoes with a double expresso.  The coffee they have is nothing shy of amazing.  Their roaster is from Costa Rica."}
{"text":"Perfect little Mom and Pop breakfast/lunch spot. Stuck out of the way in a little nook off Alameda. Super friendly staff. The lady that rang us up actually helped me find an app that's a weather radar which is super helpful to me. I guess they use it because they make homemade chili when it rains. (I'm sure it's to die for). If you find yourself here you HAVE to try the Monte Cristo. Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"This place is great for the price and location and it's why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's in the middle of a business district. Service was great! It's clean, bright, but they need to turn the ac on cuz it was warm! They offer simple breakfast & lunch options and have a decent selection. I came in here for brunch after a job interview and ordered the veggie omelete. You order at the counter and wait for ur food. It came with two slices of toasted bread, each cut in half. A gal brought my order and asked what kind of jelly I wanted. Love grape jelly! The eggs were yummy and so was the toast w/ jelly. I wish they had apple juice. My only other complaint besides the temp is that they don't offer milk alternatives like almond or coconut milk. I think it's become a standard for most business and you'll lose a lot of business if you don't keep up. For example, I stopped going to Starbucks because they didn't offer an alternative other than soy (can't drink soy either). Starbuck's has recently begun to expand their milk options. You see, I'm lactose intolerant so cow's milk is a no for me. I would have liked to purchse an iced coffee w/ milk. Overall, I'd eat here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Today's visit was a team event with my colleagues and this café that is nearby was the workplace was mentioned. If you know the area its literally across the street from a Safeway distribution center, tucked into a business area. Best bet is to use the GPA function on the \"Yelp app\" (shameless plug). The owner was a pleasant gentleman that explained how the produce and meats are fresh and the bread is from a local bakery in the same area. Always good to know that fresh ingredients are applied to the plentiful food! I ordered myself a corn beef sandwich. Seems like when I try out a mom & pops place I have to compare corn beef anything with NY quality! Let me tell you this has to be the best and I mean best corn beef sandwich I have had in the valley!  The toasted bread was so fluffy and fresh that you can tell by the texture and flavors of the bread that it was not process nonsense. I was very pleased and so were my work buddies with the meals they chose. We will be coming back from breakfast very soon!"}
{"text":"A bunch of folks I know really like this place.  Only being open M-F it is not someplace I could normally get to.  Last week I had a free day on my vacation and drove over. Glad I did!  The place was hopping about 11 with the early lunch crowd.  It was clear most of the customers were regulars as they were being addressed by name.  I had the grilled cheese on sourdough and a cup of cream of broccoli soup. At first I thought there was something wrong with the soup until I realized it was not loaded with salt and the main taste was the broccoli, what a concept! It is really a nice friendly place with great food."}
{"text":"So I have been hearing about Morning Star Café for a while now and since I was in the area I decided to give them a try. I was already prewarned to call my order ahead, which I did,  I have to be honest I really didn't look at a menu, I just asked my besty what her favorite thing was and that's what I tried. 

What did I try you asked?? Well I ordered the Green Chile Chicken sandwich and it was delsih!  It had chunks of chicken breast, diced green chilies and melted mozzarella cheese, this sandwich was amazing!!! Loved it, the flavors of everything was so fresh, it reminded me of homemade green chili for burritos, but instead severed on a sandwich, which worked, I would have never thought of doing that, but that's because in my house we use tortillas more than bread .

I also grabbed a brownie/cookie because it looked too good to pass up, and man was I glad I did! Deliciously sweet! 

Glad I gave Morning Star a try, I do have to admit I did past the place up when 1st looking for it, didn't know it was in a industrial area, but now that I have found it I will be back more often, and calling in my order ahead worked out perfectly for me too!"}
{"text":"We are on a family vacation, flying into Phoenix from Atlanta, and driving to California.  On our way out of town, our 11 year old son randomly found this place online from all the great reviews, so we decided to give it a chance. Driving into the area, we thought we were taking a wrong turn, but there it was! We were doubtful, but can I tell you it was amazing! Not only are the owners just lovely, we had the best breakfast we think we've ever had. From the Rueben, the omelettes, the fresh baked bread, the bacon....everything was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend anyone to visit this sweet place. We would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Family owned business very accomadating for our large party of 6. Large portions of home cooked breakfast. Will stip there agsin if im ever in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast after a flight in from Indiana. The food was great and the service was even better. If you're looking for home cooking this is your place."}
{"text":"Myself and my roommate come for breakfast as often as possible. It's a very \"homey\" family owned spot with simple, consistently great food. I've never had a bad meal here, most of the time I call ahead and pick it up to go in the mornings and they are really good at handling those, always give you an accurate time, rarely more than ten minutes. The food - the breakfast highlight is the Monte cristo, but try it for lunch too! It's amazing with egg dipped bread, crispy on the outside and melted ham and cheese on the inside with generous slices of thick cut bacon. Comes with homemade jam to really make it just out of this world. Sweet and salty mmmmmmmm. The Rueben will be one of the best you've had in Arizona. And although it seems crazy, they have a tuna melt that makes me think about it randomly. It's just a simple tuna melt but the way they make the tuna is perfect every time, fresh and consistent. This couple does such a great job, and they do everything the right way. They don't mind letting you get creative and making your own things up either! Thanks for being so great to us these last years."}
{"text":"Perfect little cafe! Great atmosphere, friendly staff.
Small mom & pop place. Come on in!"}
{"text":"BACK FOR OUR WEEKLY LUNCH HERE. 
again  knocked it out of the park!!
always the best food!
the Ruben is out standing
thank you again for being the best in town!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to stop.  Stayed at the DoubleTree and walked down.  Their coffee is local and delicious.  The bread fresh and soft.  The couple running it very kind and inviting.  Very pleased with discovering this local shop."}
{"text":"The bread, coffee and omelette was delicious here! The owners were very sweet people, and the atmosphere is like a nice country kitchen. The prices are good- my latte was 3.05 and it was great coffee. I'll definitely come back here again, probably with a book to read. Its a cute cafe nestled in an industrial park."}
{"text":"Love this place, extremely friendly owners. Consistently great food and cleanliness. Would absolutely recommend the grilled egg sandwich, as well as the vanilla latte. Double if you need the extra boost!"}
{"text":"This place is a genuine cafe, not some fancy restaurant or chain that uses \"cafe\" to sound unique.

Seems family owned and operated, they allow call-ins for orders ahead of time.  Offer daily specials.  Sure, entrees/meals are $6-8/each but the serving sizes are very large and could easily be split into two meals.  

eaten here twice, both times tasted home-cooked.  will eat here again.

Liked the Thursday and Tuesday special. (I recommend the PATTY MELT or Turkey Rellano sandwiches so far.

Note: They close at 3pm, and are in a uncommon location which to me just shows they are hard-working people that don't want to waste money paying for an expensive location when their food/character speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I am a fan.  Bread is fresh baked.  Breakfast sandwich rocked my socks off.  Small place in industrial area.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in a quite tranquil ambiance... Food is good and all are super friendly!!! I was doing some work here before visiting a customer, had breakfast and worked out! Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and great service. The owners seem to really care about their customers. I'd definitely recommend stopping in for breakfast or lunch, or even breakfast for lunch!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a great little find. I had a breakfast staple, 2 eggs with bacon and sourdough toast. 
The eggs were cooked to perfection. The sourdough toast was thick sliced and crunchy. The bacon was a thick sliced applewood smoked version, delicious.  Coffee was hot and good. They only do counter service. Very nice and courteous.  They cater to a interesting mix of people.  The restaurant is located in an industrial park next to a Safeway distribution Wharehouse. No signage to speak of. I arrived at 0900 and was joined by a pair of travelers and some utility workers. You know it's gotta be good because if not this little breakfast house would not exist. Don't blink when you go by or you will miss it!  Very good home style breakfast food and good prices. Run by a mom n pop. 
Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way out of AZ and found this quaint little place.  Good food and friendly service.  I recommended you stop by and give it a try for a good breakfast and or lunch."}
{"text":"Interesting place nestled in a commercial area off alameda. You can definitely tell this is a family run business where the owners have put a lot of love and care into their business. Love the fact that they shared a lot of family photos of their grandson. The place isn't too big so I could see how it could get packed quickly on the weekends. The food is cheap and good! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for Lunch today and met my girl Andrea K.

It's a cute little Christian themed cafe with an extremely friendly staff.

They offer breakfast all day, sandwiches and soups.

At first I wasn't in the mood for a \"sandwich\" and just settled for a turkey, I asked what came on it and was told \"Anything, we customize them however you like\" 
SO I was a bit perturbed when I asked for cucumber and avocado and they didn't have any......I ended up with turkey, sprouts, tomato, swiss and deli mustard on wheat (see pics)

 It actually was a really good sandwich but for almost $9 including a drink, I think it was a bit much.

Why 4 stars? 
~Service went along way, staff was personable and seemed to really care about the customers and I enjoyed the sandwich even though it was pricey."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Well worth going a little bit out of the way. The owners are very friendly and really care about their customers. The food is delicious and portions are huge!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service. Bathroom on back available and clean. Unfortunately, aside from the jam food was unimpressive."}
{"text":"Awesome family owned and operated local cafe. We enjoyed chatting with the owners and the food was great."}
{"text":"I've ordered from morning star several times and let me tell you, I've been more than satisfied each time. The portions are great and the service is very warming. I definitely recommend the Rueben sandwich, I have had many Rueben's and the sandwich here is by far the best, I highly recommend it. Check this place out for an early breakfast or late lunch during the week!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch. Had the monte cristo for breakfast... It's huge!  Strawberry jam compliments the sandwich nicely! Ordered the turkey rellano for lunch.. All I can say is wow!!!! So delicious. Perfect combo of turkey, chillies, mayo and cheese. You have to try this sandwich!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I came here mainly for the name in a tongue-in-cheek joke with myself. To me, Morning Star is an anonym of Lucifer (from the King James Bible) so, while I wasn't completely surprised it was highly Christian-themed inside with painted Bible quotes on the walls and \"family\" decorations, I wasn't sure why they'd choose to name their cafe that. I'm not Christian myself, so it must have a completely different connotation in other versions of The Book that I'm not aware of without consulting Wikipedia.
It was also in a very industrial area, tucked into the outside corner of a warehouse building - easy to miss driving past, between all the semi trucks, even when you're looking for it. They probably get a lot of work and trucker traffic - but with the decor theme and location, it was all a bit confusing.
The important bit, the food, was delicious. Very cheap and came out quick. My bacon and cheddar breakfast burrito and coffee were both better quality than I expected. My dad also enjoyed his chorizo and green chile burrito. The two people behind the counter, who I would assume were the owners in this mom-and-pop type place, were very personable and attentive. Overall, a nice breakfast, but I think I'll leave this one to the regulars. There are less  garishly decorated breakfast joints in the area to cater to us heathens."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise!!  Easy to get to although you'd never think to look in this location for a restaurant. 

Excellent bacon. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the sourdough bread was delicious. Coffee was good too. We also ordered a sandwich to-go for our flight home. Say hi to owners from Duluth, MN."}
{"text":"As an avid traveler, I can count on 1 or 2 fingers (maybe) where I come back to the same spot and have the same thing the very next day. This little spot? FANTASTIC

Fresh everything, passionate husband and wife team ready to offer suggestions. 

Delicious, inexpensive. Really...for $5 I had a HUGE wrap with probably 3 eggs, chorizo (had the chorizo and chile---just enough spice) w/ a delicious salsa on the side. 

And why Starbucks when, for about $2.50, you get a locally roasted cappuccino. 

If I lived here, this would be my breakfast spot. An EASY 5 stars"}
{"text":"The owner may claim to be simply 'politically incorrect' however that is a statement that I have heard from many a racist before. Its the same as saying, \"I'm not a racist, I just believe in genetic purity.\" 

I was unhappy to be at the receiving end of a rant that wandered from how he threw his wife's food out because she'd put salt on it. Which apparently offended him as a chef...or something. In my opinion that is abusive, controlling, misogynist behavior that is reprehensible. It at least points to an inability to communicate and a sharp need to be correct, perhaps a dangerous need.

Furthermore, his referencing 'Lousy-anna' referring to Lousiana, the Shreveport area if I remember correct, became tiresome immediately. He called the population of the area he used to live, please forgive me, niggers! His claim that he was referencing the white and black population fell short when he told a story of catching a young black child he caught stealing. He apparently asked the child why he was stealing and was offended that the answer as that \"You whites have been stealing from us for years.\"  I had to leave to get to work, I would have left just as quickly had I not had to be at work 5 minutes later. My only regret was that I had to leave my poor girlfriend there...

Sir, if you wish to be a racist (excuse me: Politically Incorrect) you can do it without my dollars lining your pocket. I am sad to no longer have a place on my way to work that I could stop to grab a bite. I am truly discomfited riding my bike past the cafe and seeing that you are still in business. 

If you like your breakfast with a side of racism and misogyny, eat here. If you are a Russell Pearce, Joe Arpaio, or SB1070 supporter, here is your place. 

If you feel that people should not be judged, eat somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't just dress up in bible verse, perhaps somewhere that embraces christian values, not just trite statements everywhere you look."}
{"text":"First time in and it's all thanks to YELP reviewers. The friendly mom and pop shop has been here for 10 years. We tried the green chili chicken soup, which had a great spicy kick to it. I had a veggie omelette and asked for tomatoes and cheddar cheese added to it. Got to choose a side of white, wheat, or sourdough toast (usually not a big toast fan ill have maybe 1-2 slices) but this, I had 3 of 4 since the bread was just TOO good! The omelette tasted completely homemade- none of that fake eggs subway uses. The Cheese steak sandwich is also one to try! Friendly service, great big portions, fresh bread, and not bad prices, definitely need to go again!"}
{"text":"Greeted with a smile and great service. Food was delicious and authentic. Got the Italian Sandwich and Soup of the day. Both solid choices, filling and fresh. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Friendly staff, great food. No preservatives. Homemade desserts. Muffins to die for. Consider splitting a sandwich with a friend so you can split a dessert."}
{"text":"Interesting location amongst warehouses. Cozy environment. Fabulous owner Peggy Marshall told us all about Phoenix and stuff to do. Highly recommend the chorizo wrap. Thanks MSC!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and the owners run the place.
Food came quickly, was tasty and fresh.
Owners took time to check on us.

Going back!!"}
{"text":"Nice family-owned cafe with yummy veggie options. Super friendly owners made our visit special especially for our kids."}
{"text":"People are nice. Food is mediocre. Had the special, which was a Turkey wrap with cranberry salsa. Thought it would be a good/healthy spin on Turkey dinner.
The wrap was dry and the lettuce mix was bitter. Cranberry salsa was bitter as well. Not sweet like you would think when looking at cranberries.
Was just Turkey, salad mix, tortilla, and a small thing of cranberry salsa on the side"}
{"text":"I love the small cafe vibe! They had quick service and delicious coffee! They can also pack it to go if you're in a hurry! I definitely recommend coming here for your morning coffee and breakfast!"}
{"text":"Bread is tasty. Eggs and bacon are okay. Layout, seating, and ordering/paying are a little confusing for a first-timer.

If they added a prominently displayed sign at the front of the store, it'd be easier for first timers to figure out that the place is order at the counter, pay at the counter, and tip at the counter. Then, seat yourself and food is brought to you.

The food itself could be tastier but the portions are large."}
{"text":"Best cream of Mushroom soup. Ever. All the soups are homemade and everyday it's a different soup! Mmmm"}
{"text":"Well deserved 4 1/2 star rating., I give it a 5. Truly a mom & pop business,, operated by a husband and wife. The service is excellent, my veggie omelet was loaded with veggies & cooked perfectly and reasonably priced. The regular coffee is great and they also have expresso, etc. The menu isn't fancy,  just  basic, simple breakfast & lunch fare.  I served 2 of their fresh baked pies for Thanksgiving and it was unanimous among 10 people that they were outstanding.

This place is off the beaten path in Tempe's  industrial area but well worth seeking out. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Yelp brought me to this place when I was looking for a locally owned breakfast joint.  It did not disappoint, and I have turned into a repeat customer every since.  The owners are always so friendly and willing to chat if it is slow.  

Favorites: Coffee is brewed slightly sweet and is a great price!  BLT tastes better than I could make at home, big plus that the bacon is amazing and cooked correctly!  

I will definitely return here many more times!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars in every area. Great food, great service, and great people. We came in and got a Denver omelet, a Spinach, Bacon, and Swiss omelet, and a BLT. All were really good, and the sourdough bread was awesome. I also got an iced coffee myself, and it was great. I'm actually craving it right now. To top it all off, the people who work here are very nice. The two people we talked to were husband and wife. The husband was super nice, joked around with us, and made sure we were happy with our food. The wife was also really cool. I'm glad we came here, and if we stop by Phoenix area again, we'll be here again."}
{"text":"Just ate theFrench toast and it was amazing!  Bty this is my first time here. I only came in because of the yelp reviews but I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The food is really good! My whole family all ordered something different and we all loved what we had. I had the breakfast burrito which was absolutely delicious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would not return to this place unless you are looking for a sub-par breakfast establishment. I don't recommend it. Eggs were  supposed to be over medium but came out brown and cooked too hot. The white was brown and crispy, and the white was still runny. The coffee had no flavor whatsoever, and the salsa was so vinegary i had to stop eating.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Morning Star Cafe is this cute little cafe in a business district area around the corner from the Angels Tempe Diablo Stadium. We took our 11U baseball team which totaled to a 24 people (parents, players and siblings).  They were so welcoming and handled us perfectly.....One person (the owner) was serving all our food and refilling our coffee and he did an outstanding job. The also make latte's and cappuccino's and my husband has the best nutmeg cinnamon vanilla latte. The food was amazing. The BREAD is baked fresh and is delivered to the cafe every morning from a local bakery.  You can really tell that everything is made fresh. I had the spinach, bacon and swiss omelette and it was so flavorful, not greasy and DELICISOUS.  Their pancakes and omelette portions are big enough to share. The owner's were a very sweet couple and they and their staff were incredible.  Thank You so much from the T2 Orioles 11U Baseball Team, Corona CA"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Tucked away in a truck driver Industrial Park, this mom and pop breakfast spot is definitely top notch. The Monte Cristo and Pancakes are excellent. You can definitely taste the freshness in their \"from scratch\" recipes on down to the jumbo muffins and baked goods. The homemade muffins remind me of my mom's... Super yummy!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place today. The food was so good and the staff is amazing. I will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Morning Star Cafe is a small family owned restaurant with 10 to 12 tables for sitting. I enjoyed the Italian Zucchini & Tomato dish, a simple omelette with a bit of Romani cheese. The zucchini, tomato, and romano cheese made the perfect combination of flavours which my mouth really loved. Served with sour dough toast with butter, complete deliciousness.
I was not allowed to take pictures of everything, why I only give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly, personal service. The Monte Cristo is great. It's off Priest and Alameda in an industrial area. Non de script and non pretentious. Perfect."}
{"text":"Their bread is baked fresh daily!! YUM! Their sandwiches are huge, so I'm glad they serve halves. The tuna melt on Rye (with Swiss substitued for cheddar) is amazing and delicious! Very small place, but definitely worth it. They are super friendly too!"}
{"text":"food is delish! they have really good specials and the service is great! quiet quaint place that is a little diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!! The omelet was delicious and it was the best bacon I have ever had! The coffee was better then Starbucks!! I would come back and I would recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how much I love this place! Such a cute café and the food was amazing. Its nestled in between industrial buildings and doesn't look like much from the outside but I was complete blown away by the customer service and food. 

Peter and Peggy both greeted me and talked me through the menu. I ended up getting the half tuna melt and onion soup. I don't say this often but it was the best lunch I have had in a very long time, you could taste the love it was made with, I can't wait to try the breakfast! Also! Don't forget to grab a cookie...they are a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know is that this is a \"place your order and sit down\" cafe. Second thing to know is that everyone is very friendly here and wants to make sure you enjoy your food. I had the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and wheat toast. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great! The only strange thing was plastic silverware, but it worked just fine and not a big deal. I wasn't a fan of the coffee, but my wife really enjoyed it and her breakfast as well. 

I would definitely recommend this place as a casual \"off the beaten path\" cafe."}
{"text":"MUST GO!!  Ok, where do I start.  Today was our first visit to the Morning Star Cafe but it won't be our last!  The quality, freshness, and flavor of the ingredients makes this restaurant get it's 5 star rating!  The homemade cheese danishes are the best ones we've ever had!  

We each had a variation on eggs and bacon for our breakfast.  My husband had a 2 egg breakfast, I had an egg, cheese and bacon breakfast sandwich, and my sister-in-law had an egg and cheese wrap.  The eggs were cooked perfectly in all 3 variations.  The sourdough bread was delicous.  The roll on the breakfast sandwich ......  YUM.  My sister-in-law was raving about the salsa that came with her breakfast wrap.  

We are very excited to go back and try their lunch menu now.  (although I'm going to be craving those cheese danishes for a while!!).  Mouthwatering!!!

The last two things worth mentioning are the exceptional service and warm atmosphere.  The husband and wife owners both talked to us and made us feel so welcome.  We're new to the area and they gave us some great information.  It was like we were talking to friends we'd known for a while!  It really made the meal special.

Thank you, Morning Star Cafe for doing what you do, the way you do it!!  
See you for lunch VERY soon!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because my new job is nearby and the reviews were all positive. I will say you have to keep your eyes peeled because I accidentally drove right past it.

I walked in and it's a nice little restaurant with maybe 10 tables at most. I asked the owner what he recommended being that it was my first time there- he was super nice and went through the rundown. I ended up having the special which was Roast Beef and a HUGE iced coffee. The sandwich was amazing- I ate the whole thing in one sitting. 

If you're looking for a good sandwich and want to try something new try this place - it will not be a let down!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, food, and atmosphere. The owners are very friendly. Highly recommend the muffins and 3 egg breakfast.."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful find! My boyfriend and I came here around brunch time and loved it! We have never been before but were immediately welcomed and given some great recommendations. To start we had coffee and tea (great selection of hot teas) and a homemade triple berry muffin with blueberry, raspberry, and blackberry. I had the Tuesday  daily special of turkey relleno sandwich and he had the one egg breakfast with sourdough toast. We even got a broken molasses cookie on the house which was lightly sweet and chewy.
Very friendly and welcoming with decor that made you feel homey, like you were in someone's kitchen not a restaurant. They had a really cute patio area too! We're from out of town but we will return when we are back in the city and I'm telling all of my local friends.
It's little and tucked away without a big sign so be careful not to miss it!"}
{"text":"Peggy and Peter offer the most warm morning smiles. The food is incredible!! Breakfast wraps and omelettes are so so Tasty.  Awesome restaurant and the hospitality is truly wonderful! Recommend to anyone looking for the BEST breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Everyone should check this place out. Shopping local is one thing but its so hard to find a good mom and pop place in the city now a days and this place is just that and it won't let you down. The food is awesome the couple who owns it and run it are so nice and acomidating . they will chat with you and make you feel at home. Maybe one of my favorite lunch spots in town."}
{"text":"Great service, owners make you feel like family. Good coffee, great food (get the monte Cristo!!) and great company. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem. Visiting from out of town and I felt right at home.  Friendly fast counter Service,  if it isn't too busy, take a moment to chat with the owners - they're delightful. I had the 2 egg breakfast with bacon, wheat toast, and strawberry Jam.  The bread and jam were homemade, the bacon was thick cut crispy, cooked to perfection and nothing was greasy in the slightest.  It was plenty of food and I couldn't quite finish it all.  I did steal a bite or two of my husbands pancakes-- thick, fluffy, and golden...who could resist?  The smooth coffee was the perfect compliment to a great meal. The only complaint would be a somewhat limited menu (no hash browns) Not enough of a complaint to detract from 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went for late breakfast...ended up with an early lunch....food was fantastic...had the reuben...on the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Great food stop with lovely hosts! Breakfast sandwich is incredible. Pancakes were a hit with kids. We are really glad that Yelp suggested this spot to our family."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!! The best I have had in a while probably! and the waiter and waitress's were awesome, friendly and very nice!! My boyfriend had the monte sandwich and I had the French toast and another time the omelet, they were both delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken salad stuffed tomato. It was so, so. My husband ordered a \"Monte Cristo\" that said it had egg which was weird but he thought he would try it. It came out a Ham and swiss with turkey on slightly toasted sourdough. It was NOT a \"Monte Cristo\"! He thought about complaining but it took so long to get in the first place he just kept it. Never returning."}
{"text":"Wow, really glad we found this place on Yelp. Food was outstanding, service was quick, servings were large, and prices were fair. I had the oh-so yummy Green-Chile Chicken sandwich and my wife had a top-notch Monte Cristo -- topped off with a shared strawberry dessert. We'll be back and we'll bring friends"}
{"text":"This spot is the perfect lunch spot when your craving old school soup, and sandwich cafe. The food is always good, fast, filling, and they've some great daily specials. The Couple that own the place are friendly and provide great service. This place has a country vibe and is in an industrial complex - meaning the place isn't super fancy , but food quality and value are top notch."}
{"text":"The MorningStar Café was a great experience, you normally wouldn't expect such great food, service and extremely warm and loving environment from a place that is sort of hidden but it is truly a gem. The owner was be on hospitable and sweet and it was an amazing experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Get the Monte Cristo! Fresh and good quality. Friendly owners that will have a conversation with you. Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"Completely unimpressed. My girlfriend and I did not feel the least bit welcomed. I guess they feel customer service isn't necessary since the business is family owned? Food was mediocre. We were kind of afraid to eat it. We got pancakes, eggs and bacon. Pancakes were decent but my friend discovered old food stuck to the bottom of her plate while trying to enjoy. The man who served us looked dirty and like he didn't feel like serving. My friend accidentally spilled syrup on one of the menus and when he came to pick it up, we watched him take it to the back and show the lady working the register with a scowl on his face, looked like he mouthed something distasteful. The whole thing looked unprofessional and we were very uncomfortable. We ended up leaving with pretty much full plates. We weren't full yet..  Just didn't feel right."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to start. Ordered the Monte Cristo and I was blow the fuck away. The bacon is so crispy. The bread it has that toasty to perfection taste. The staff was awesome. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. So good. Perfect hole in wall place . The was amazing and the service was great. Anytime we are gonna be around here we are coming back"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.   From its baked goods to their filling sandwiches you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Good food, but they are not fast at delivering it. They do take their time. The Ruben is good, it is grilled. Southwest chicken is also tasty."}
{"text":"Great little Christian owned cafe.
My eggs were cooked just the way I like. That's a first for any restraunt.
Wife omelette was huge
We will defiantly come back any time we are in the area 
God Bless"}
{"text":"A couple of years ago I was looking for a lunch spot. Who knew this little gem was right outside the confines of our campus?  The Turkey sandwich special on Tuesdays?  Soooooooo gooooood. The first time I only ate half and saved the rest for later in the day. Now I'll stuff the entire sandwich into my face and moan for a couple hours because I ate way too much in one sitting. The cakes and pies are delicious too. I try not to let my inner fatty eat here everyday. :)  The management and staff are very nice and pleasant to speak to while you wait for the delicious creations."}
{"text":"This is a small family owned cafe super cute and welcoming. I ordered the chicken sandwich with green Chile. The food was great and the service was even better. Definitely recommend this place if your grabbing some lunch."}
{"text":"What a great lil gem tucked away in an industrial area. We love to find little \"mom and pop\" places like this! Super friendly owners, cute little API for a quick, but healthy lunch! The honey wheat bread is so awesome! Highly suggest to give them a try!"}
{"text":"What an amazing little joint to have an AWESOME breakfast! Fair prices and the owners were super!"}
{"text":"Had the Turkey sandwich with green chile.  Really friendly family and the sandwich was excellent!  Great family place to stop!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place with great breakfast and coffee.   Stop in if you are in the area and want a quick , home cooked type breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. The food is outstanding and the owners are warm and friendly. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Just what you want for breakfast Home baking especially the brownies. Loved the sausage provolone wrap"}
{"text":"I like the place.. Not a big fan of ordering at the counter due to the fact that there are no a lot of tables and I would not want to order and have no place to sit, but with a small crowd it seems to work .. 

The food was very good except they did not serve chopped potatoes with breakfast.  We spoke about it and they did not want to serve any type of frozen potatoes.. I still think they could chop up fresh potatoes cook them to a point where they need a few min to finish and serve..  

All in all I would come back ."}
{"text":"Strange little place... Bible quotes painted on the walls, pictures of Jesus hanging, and religious music playing. You'll definitely get your dose of scripture if you can find this tiny spot tucked in the middle of a very industrial area. I was traveling for business, needing to escape my hotel, and limited on time - so didn't have many options.

I didn't like... that my table was dirty (as were a couple others) in a nearly empty restaurant. As I sat, the place filled up a bit: prompting the owner/ employee sitting next to me to get up from his breakfast and help out (but not wash his hands first). Also... No fruit/ potato/ grit side options.

I did like... that my food came out quickly, the wrap I ordered was big and tasty. The coffee was hot and strong. 

It's also an independently owned, little mom and pop shop. I dig that."}
{"text":"Yummy monte cristo! We also tried a blueberry, raspberry, blackberry muffin which was to die for. Quick, inexpensive, and delicious breakfast. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent monte cristo. And Peter, the owner, greeted me, rang up my order, and while my sandwich cooked he chatted with me at the counter like an old buddy. He told me how all his food is fresh daily and local. And his cook has been with him for 9 years. 

Quaint little place with great food and great mom-and-pop service."}
{"text":"Awesome mom and pop cafe!! We got the french toast and eggs and they were delicious! Reasonably priced too! The owners were super nice. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"A very lovely small family-styled breakfast/lunch place. Very friendly service, by the couple who owns the business. Serving is quick, and most importantly, delicious! Had veggie omelet; oh my, so good that I literally fell in love with the home-made taste!"}
{"text":"This place is precisely what you want when you're trying to do brunch.  Beyond satisfactory"}
{"text":"I found this cafe on my Yelp app and I am so glad I did.  I had an egg sandwich - it was the best I had ever had.  I also had a slice of cake that was divine!  The owners were super sweet.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're gonna plaster Christ all over your establishment and basically name your place after him.....don't be a jerk. 


Long story short, came in to pick up an order.....their card reader wasn't swiping my card and one of the (male) owners was a jerk about it. He reluctantly entered it in manually, which I guess was a big enough deal to be unkind and unprofessional about.

Maybe don't take patronage for granted and perhaps actually try to embody the values you're supposedly projecting the image of through your business?

PS-
The stripe on my card works fine, it was the establishments card reader that wasn't working and the owner took it out on me."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this breakfast spot is so highly rated.  The owners seemed very nice and very religious which I guess is why they are rated so highly.  But, honestly, we are from out of state and wanted a nice breakfast spot.  This place is sandwiched in between what seem to be storage facilities.  This was such a miss.  They claim the coffee is the best around.  YUCH."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little place and it's great! I have been here a few times. Once, sat outside- they let us sit without ordering to talk to a friend (very kind of them). Second time, inside. Food is really good. I had a pancake (giant!), extremely affordable and the owner/managers were really nice and through with taking our coffee orders. My husband had the egg sandwich with ham. Total bill under $15. He's super picky and loved it. We will be back anytime we are in this part of town."}
{"text":"Good little spot in an interesting location.  Sort of a business park/industrial area and it's tucked away.  They seem to have a good local following. 

I had the half soup/sandwich but no coffee this time.  Based on other coffee review comments, I'm going to have to stop by for a cappucino.

Good prices, GREAT soup (chicken corn chowder)."}
{"text":"Loved this little mom & pop. Good food, better service, tucked away in an industrial park. Chatted with the owners who were super nice. Open early and very affordable."}
{"text":"Really great little Breakfast/Lunch place tucked into one of the most industrial parts of Tempe.  You might not even know it was there were it not for a few covered tables on a make shift patio.  Really great food, super prices and almost disgustingly nice people who work there!  

The place is so cute.  Black and white checkered tiles.  White bead board up to a chair rail.  Very homey without being overly kitschy.  

While they do all the basics, and do them well, this isn't just your basic fare.  How about their Muffelatta for $5.15?  Or their Hot Sweet Italian sandwich - with sausage, onion, peppers and mushrooms w/ melted provolone cheese ($5.85)?  And their Spinach salad with egg and bacon for $5.05?  All good.  They even have a Monte Cristo ($5.15) on their menu! And their basics are great.  I had the Tuna melt ($5.05) on an employee's recommendation and it's one of the best one's I've had in a long time.  I haven't had their breakfasts yet, but I've got my eye on their Egg, Chorizo and roasted green chile wrap for $3.25.  

And then there are their drinks.  Sure - when I saw I could get Hires Root Beer or Squirt with my lunch, I was stoked.  But then I saw their coffee menu.  How about a large (32oz) Iced Coffee for $2.25? Or a large Iced Chai for $2.05???  They also Cappuccino, Espresso and Lattes for similarly great prices.  

But in the end, it's the folks who work there that have knocked me out. My first time there, the girl who took my order remembered my name and checked on me twice at my table - by name.  She wasn't a waitress, just worked behind the counter.  But when she came to clear a table, she just wanted to check on things.  

I almost hate to give the place up, but the more folks who come by, the more likely I am to be able to keep this place around.  So I definitely encourage you to come by.  Even if it's to just grab a coffee and a baked good.  Yes - they bake things fresh on site every day.  Just one more layer of their oh so goodness.  If only they were open on Saturday...

Hours: M-F, 6am-3pm"}
{"text":"It was a pleasure visiting with owner's Peter and Peggy this morning. Our breakfast was fantastic; made with jumbo eggs, large crispy butchered bacon, thick multi-grain \"Texas\" toast, on and on.  Farm to Table at it's finest. Cheap too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Topped only by the service, which is the friendliest you'll find in Phoenix. 

I had the 1/2 sammie and soup. I chose their 3-cheese grilled cheese, which was great, along with their chicken tortilla soup. It cost me $3.10.

I had a huge (generous portion) of 2% milk for $1.75 and a cup of coffee, which I heard was some pretty great coffee. I liked it, yes, but I wouldn't rave that it was the best ever. 

My colleagues loved this place. They said they can't wait to come back. Good! 

I was able to talk to the owner about Yelp and how we all heard of this place. I'm glad I was able to do a lunch search in the area of Eba Cafe. This place is the perfect lunch spot, followed by a quick drive over for boba tea afterwards. 

They serve breakfast all day. The prices are reasonable. And, like I said, it's super friendly. So, what are you waiting for? Go!"}
{"text":"This is our new sandwhich addiction. We ordered to go over the phone, so it was ready when we arrived. Turkey Club and Muffalatta. We shared half of each sandwhich with each other.  The Muffalatta reminded me of the one I had in New Orleans, and the bacon in the Turkey club was sensational. Tslk to them about tipoing before they ring you up."}
{"text":"what stands out for this cafe is the customer service. the owners are really hospitable and friendly. the cafe itself has a cozy feeling. it is located centralized and near an industrialized area. in terms of the food, it is made with care but felt that it lacks a bit of flavor."}
{"text":"Omelette was overcooked with sparse fillings and served with toast only, no potatoes. Eggs and bacon served with toast only, no potatoes. We had three people drinking coffee, two with cream. Counter attendant poured cream in one cup of coffee and brought the other cups to our table, black. We asked for cream. He took the cup of coffee back and poured some cream in...what??? No coffee refills and no cream option for our table, the entire time. Plastic silverware. Terrible experience. Not anything I'd ever repeat."}
{"text":"I was really craving a tuna melt, hadn't had one in a long time, and we found this place recommended for that. WOW, it was awesome!  It was by far the best tuna melt I've ever had.  Great little place that is off the beaten path in an industrial area, not easy to find, but well worth the trip. 
I can't stop thinking about how good that sandwich was!  It's like going to your grandma's house and having her make you a really really good sandwich using Texas toast style sourdough, buttery toasted, and fresh tuna salad. Nothing like anything I've had before at a restaurant!  Loved it that much!  We will go back soon for sure to try their breakfast and infamous coffee."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in Phx all week and the owners are super nice as are the other patrons!! Will definitely be back next trip!  Oh and yeah, the coffee is pretty darn good!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. Too bad they are only open for breakfast and lunch Monday - Friday. Based on what I had and the likely hood that I'll never be able to make it to this place for lunch, and since there simply is not much that can be done for breakfast by anyone to make it something special I can only give 3.5 stars. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, and since I can't actually give a half-star rating I give them 4 stars. Besides it is a mom/pop place and they are better than some national/international chain (rarely will ever give a chain better than 3 stars); I can't lump them into same category as the chains. To do so would be injustice."}
