{"text":"Good slice but nowhere near the quality that Richie had created here.  Still light years ahead of Pizza Hut slop (still baffled that people go there), but not as good as it was. I like their 2 slice lunch special."}
{"text":"I love the lunch special.  Around 5 bucks for 2 hot slices and a drink.  Nice foldable pizza. The way NYC pizza should be."}
{"text":"Do Not Ever Go There... The reply I got from the staff was not like a NYC place of business... They hung the phone up... They deserve what they get.... Nothing"}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this place to me as the best thin crust, NY style pizza in Charlotte. I got my hopes up, only to be slightly disappointed.   The pizza itself should get 3.5 stars. The toppings were great. The amount of sauce and cheese was perfect. The problem for me was the crust. It was not thin, foldable or chewy. It was a bit too thick; straight out of the oven had a lot of crunch but then softened up a bit by the time I got home.   I like the two guys running the place. They were no nonsense, but they greeted regulars by name.   The garlic knots were inedible, in my opinion. But at $1.75 for 5, it was not a huge loss.   Although it was disappointing, this pizza is definitely good enough to eat again."}
{"text":"This place has Tanked... Avoid. Im just getting off work 730. There out of slices. And not making anymore.  With a better feel I might have ordered a pie and took the rest home."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the area. We love pizza and we have been trying all the pizza joints around the university area for the last 8 years and finally NYPD is the BEST  NY style pIzza of the area. The owner is very dedicated to make a good pizza and every pie is delicious. If you like NY style pizza them you have to give it a try."}
