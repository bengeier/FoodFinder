{"text":"It was good. I'm not big into eating crazy healthy, (clearly, if you look at my check ins), but I love pizza and this didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Really, I'd like to give it a 2.5 because I'm 50/50 on this place...  I love the fact that Naked Pizza offers a healthier alternative for pizza - natural ingredients, gluten free crust (if you want to pay extra and are OK with it being available only in 14\" size), etc. Usually pizzas will make me feel gross afterwards simply because of all the grease, oil, bad crap in it, etc. - I don't get that feeling after eating a Naked Pizza. Also, I got 3 pizzas for me and a couple others on a Saturday night (two 10\" pizzas and a 14\") and we got our food within a half hour.  On the other hand, it's definitely over priced, especially for what you're getting. The regular crust looks more like it should be thin crust. If you don't like the standard styles of pizzas and want to create your own masterpiece, each topping costs $1.49. I like cheeses, so a 10\" with cheddar added onto it costs $7.48... plus tax... and plus delivery if you want that. Finally, and this is probably because the pizzas are supposed to be all natural, but they're pretty bland.   I'd order from them again, but it won't be that often."}
{"text":"The pizza seems good for organic and wanting to eat healthier. Crust is airy and crispy. Sauce was sweet. Toppings were fresh. Give the pizza a 6 out of 10 scale since raised with NY pizza. This is not the reason I gave them a 2 star.  Normally I would not care about service when eating someplace because I like to take home or hope they spend more time on their food quality.  That being said, the service is always horrible. Seems like a bunch of people who don't want to be there and obviously management has overstaffed. Pizza was cold the last couple times I went. Not going back. Go to Dysart and Mcdowell to get Sal's Tuscan Pizza. Better taste and quality in food."}
{"text":"Trying to eat healthier and pizza is my weakness. (so good luck to me) Therefore, I was delighted to run across Naked Pizza that allows me to do both. The pizza did not lack on taste and was priced within my budget. Will go again"}
{"text":"It is OK, but really not all that good tasting.  I don't care one way or the other about the manufactured \"healthy hype\"...it is pizza and when I eat pizza, I just want it to taste good. Again, it is just OK, but truthfully, the Little Caesars $5 pizza tastes much better."}
{"text":"Great concept and staff but at the end of the day the pizza is not that good. We waited for about a year watching the companies social media marketing campaign with high hopes.   We had a pepperoni pizza and one with ground beef and veggies. The crust is great but the toppings and sauce seemed cheep. If I was blind folded I may be hard pressed to differentiate this pizza from a place with low quality products like Little Ceasers."}
{"text":"Love my pizza Naked! Let's start by saying that I'm just excited to get SOMETHING in the neighborhood that isn't the same ole' same ole' that is on every street corner in Phoenix. So I awaited Naked Pizza with anticipation.   I expected it to be busy Friday night when I pulled in. I found a parking spot right up front. I was surprised that there was no seating and it is take out/delivery only. But that's ok if it is tasty! We asked for suggestions and we were given a couple of recommendations. We ordered a 10\" Superbiotic and a 10\" BBQ chicken both on original crust.   There were a few people in the lobby and ordering. It was clear that they were buzzing around like bees in the back keeping up with orders and the warming oven was full to the brim with boxes of pizzza so they were clearly very busy. I waited about 7 minutes for the pizza and we were on our way. We were very happy with the in-store service.   When we got the pizza home I was even more impressed. I found the crust to be absolutely delicious. The Superbiotic was as yummy as any $19 smaller pizza in any wood-fired joint. The crust was tasy and good...Now I'm not a huge pizza eater. My favorite is a White pizza....but this I ate every single solitary morsel of. None left for the dogs or anyone else!   I was back Sunday and Wednesday.   Welcome to the neighborhood Naked Pizza!!"}
{"text":"With all the uncertainty,in fast food.This right here;is Truly a most Def.In our constant driving schedule;will be sure to pass along your locale."}
{"text":"Pizza night! I was pushing for Barro's, but my sister talked me into trying Naked Pizza (since every time we see their fliers and crowds of employees on the side of the road we say \"Hey. We should try that place. Sometime.)  Online ordering was super easy. There is a $10 minimum for delivery, and since my one-topping thin crust 14\" pizza came to $9.88, I added a $.35 dipping sauce to bring the total up. With tax and delivery charge, it was about $13.   Pizza arrived like 20 minutes later. Very fast. They totally forgot the dipping sauce. I guess I don't mind since I didn't want it in the first place. But still. I paid for it. What if I *had* really wanted it?  I guess I didn't really think about how small a 14\" pizza was while I was ordering. I just chose the biggest option. I was kind of disappointed . Also, there were very few mushrooms. I counted only 12 on a pizza with 8 slices. Super sad.   The taste was good. Some of the reviews here mentioned thinking the regular crust was kind of weird, so I was playing it safe and ordered thin crust.  Next time I'll risk it. Turned out to be VERY thin crust. Like paper thin. And since that all-natural cheese still produces a lot of grease, it was kind of gross to eat. (With a thicker crust, I imagine more of the grease would soak in).  With tip, I spent $15 total. The experience wasn't worth that to me. Next time, I'll just get a regular crust cheese pizza (why spend extra money for such skimpy toppings?). And I'll pick it up on the way home from work to save on extra costs (delivery, bogus-dipping-sauce-charges, and tipping). A $9 price tag sounds more appropriate for the experience."}
{"text":"Talked with Cathy at Naked Pizza. She told me that I was dumb, and that at Naked Pizza the customer wasn't right.   50 minutes after ordering my pizza, and after 3 calls back from this store Cathy informed me that they didn't deliver to me. Now to be fair, it seems to be a failure in their website, since that is why I ordered from them. So here I sit, hungry and pissed off. If you want pizza with integrity, save yourself some trouble and go pick up some Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"Great pizzas with a nice variety of toppings.  We get the mediterranean and love it.  Have also tried the smokehouse and cheese, both were very good.  Would like more sauce on the pizzas, but otherwise, super!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out.  Thanks to a newly acquired allergy, I'm living the gluten free life these days, and anywhere that caters to me and my fellow sufferers, is worth trying out.    I placed an order online for a Friday night pick-up.  Keep in mind, I don't exactly live close, but was willing to make the drive.  My order was placed several hours before pick up, and consisted of one gluten free veggie pizza, and one traditional veggie pizza, for my niece.    I left a little early, to stop and do a little shopping along the way (why make a trip for only 1 purpose).  As I pulled into the parking lot, it was easy enough to spot, considering how tiny this place is.  I walked inside, checked out the modern decor, and waited for someone to appear.  As I identified myself, I could see things starting to look bleak.  The guy helping me out (who didn't introduce himself, & didn't have a name tag on) let me know that they were out of gluten free pizzas, but would be happy to make both my pizzas traditionally.  I can see this person doesn't understand why people eat gluten free in the first place.  Obviously I was confused, and probably starting to look displeased, and as I started to ask, \"What do you mean you're out of gluten free pizzas?\", he interrupted me to let me know that they tried to call me and tell me.  Strange...I didn't hear my phone ring.  I took my phone out of my purse, and realized they called me 4 minutes before I was supposed to pick up my order.  Now that's just ridiculous.  They had to know I was already there, or almost there at that point.  Now I'm just ticked.  First off, who runs out of gluten free?!  Second, you obviously knew you were out, but didn't call me until I got there?!  You had more than 2 hours to call and let me know.  Wow.....now I'm just speechless...mostly because I'm hungry, and pissed, and afraid I might spontaneously combust at this point.  Although this twit has no idea about customer service or food allergies, I doubt incurring my wrath will do more than scar him for life, plus my niece was there, and lord knows that child needs a good role model in her life, so I leave hungry, and disgusted.    IF you're going to make part of your business model selling specific items that cater to allergy prone people, MAYBE you should do a better job of educating your staff, and MAYBE you should do a better job ordering supplies/ingredients, and MAYBE, just MAYBE, you should all learn what good customer service entails, because I guarantee you that experience I had could NOT have been any worse.   If I could give you less than 1 star, I would."}
{"text":"I love getting Naked.....Naked Pizza, that is!  Thrilled to have this healthy option in the neighborhood.   Have tried 5 varieties of their pizza so far, and favorite combo is jalapeno, red pepper, spinach, sun dried tomato, red sauce on regular crust.  I highly recommend the cheese sticks with red dipping sauce, which is high on pure tomato flavor and low on sodium.  Ordering online is convenient and delivery time exceeded my expectations, especially for a Friday night.  Don't expect this to be like the other guys, this is a unique pizza concept for those who care about what they eat.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of this pizza place:) It's as easy and convenient as other places,  but WAY healthier. The crust was yummy without making me sick with grease. The cheese was either really good quality or cooked perfectly - idk, but i liked it a lot. AND the pro-biotics were EXACTLY what I was hoping for. I felt great after eating their pizza - something not a lot of other pizzas can say. It is so extremely good for you, i'm surprised it turned out so well. And I really didn't think it would as easy and quick as other places.   Needless to say, I'll be going here again :)   Oh! And it has a vegan option right now, which i'm hesitant to try but many of you out there may be interested"}
{"text":"After seeing mixed reviews, I deceided to try it.  My husband and I ordered a 14\" original crust, sausage w/ 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 mushroom.  I thought it was very good.  The wheat dough is very yummy and I was even more excited to find out it was only 4 pts for 4 slices on my WW diet.  Very friendly service.  It's not your typical greasy, cheesy pizza which I love as well.  But if you are trying to be health conscious, this is for you."}
{"text":"We ordered a couple pizzas tonight via their on-line system and were given an estimated delivery time of about 25 minutes.  We thought this sounded quite short but were willing to give them a little leeway.  After they missed the estimated delivery time by 45 minutes I called to see what the status of our pizza was.  Alexa or Alexis (not sure which) answered the phone and as soon as she pulled up our order she started apologizing profusely, she put me on hold and after a few minutes another person answered the phone with much more of a gruff voice, didn't say anything except \"this is ???? (didn't catch name).  I figured the phone had been picked up by someone else so I told her I was talking to the other person.  She told me she was the manager and that the driver said he tried to deliver the pizza and the woman that answered the door told him they already got their pizza?!?!  Since it's my wife and I that were home, both expecting the pizza and both irritated that it hadn't arrived there is no way that happened at this house.  I couldn't tell if the driver messed up terribly or if this was their cover story for messing up our order and not getting it out.  Granted...they did offer to recook the pizzas and deliver them for free but at this point they are done in my book.  The last thing I want is a pizza cooked and delivered by disgruntled people.  This is the last time we will ever attempt to get a pizza from them and highly recommend you use caution when ordering."}
{"text":"Naked Pizza sucks.   1. I called in my order, told them it would be pick up. Went to pick up, they couldn't find order & turns out it was currently being delivered to my home. They were rude & blamed mistake on ME and would not refund any money. They left the pizzas at my home & I got home 8 minutes later to a pizza on the doorstep with a confused delivery girl, asking me to pay (even though it was already paid for). She had to call the store to clear up mistake (meanwhile, it's not 6:40p and my pizza was \"ready for pick up at 6:10p- so it's now cold). She left, we were extremely pissed and Naked did NOTHING to make it better.   2. Opened the now cold pizza. On a large pizza, there were probably 9 pieces of sun dried tomatoes, which looked like it needed at least 30. Obviously, a way to save money. On another pizza the pepperoni created so much grease it looked un-appetizing.   3. Pizza tasted like death. Crust was gross, toppings were burnt, blah. Have you ever eaten a cold naked pizza? Don't.   4. After feeling gross from eating blah tasting pizza & thoroughly pissed off for having a ruined Friday night (should also mention we had friends over for a diamondbacks game- and EVERYONE was disgusted & now HATES naked with a passion) we called Naked. Woman, young manager was extremely rude. After a long (5 minute) phone fight she finally refunded our money.   5. Great marketing idea, but just disgusting.   6. Honestly: dominoes (gross) or pizza hut (sick) or even frozen pizza taste ten times better."}
{"text":"My new favorite thing! Love the pizza here sooooo much. You get to eat your pizza and not feel like a hog after!"}
{"text":"Little pricey, but totally worth it.   I received a menu on my doorstep 3 weeks ago advertising \"natural\" pizza. Thinking it was just going to be soylent green hippie crap, I didn't think anything of it until the mood struck me one day to order online. I was sick of being reminded on my calorie counter how completely horrible a single slice of other chain pizzas could be, so I thought I'd give it a shot.   I'm never ordering from anywhere else again.   Despite the sauce being a teensy bit bland (what could you really expect after they take away the chemicals?) this was seriously really, really great. To top it all off, they serve Jones Cream Soda. JONES. CREAM. SODA. I'm a fan forever."}
{"text":"1.1/5 stars - Careful, this is sort of tasty health food, but it is a far cry from pizza. If it were cheap I would go back but it's more expensive than an average pizza place so I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Got the 12\" regular hand-stretched crust with light cheese, pepperoni, half mushroom, half pineapple for 2 people for $13.00. WOW pleasantly surprised because you can talk up your natural goodness and high-quality all you want, but if it tastes like cardboard with healthy ish on it.. who gives a fudge?!?  Crispy flavorful crust Evenly distributed high-quality toppings Good sauce flavor and amount Best cheese I have had on takeout pizza stringy not congealed real mozzarella  Loved the clean flavors, cheap price, and quick 10 minute takeout.  let's go here and keep this business in the valley.  Don't let it slip through our fingers like the Churro Station did.  You will love it, you will not regret it.  Pleeease and thank you :))"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but the price was to much for a pizza. I do like that there's lactose free, gluten free options but $20 dollars for a pizza is too much."}
{"text":"Tasted good enough I guess.  Not stellar but okay.  The large is tiny, seriously not enough for two people and WAY overpriced.  It is a shame, because I was really looking forward to it but will definitely not have again at those prices."}
{"text":"My full frontal assessment: they make a really good pizza, definitely different from the stuff you get from most pizzerias. It's easy enough to order: you choose a size, a crust (gluten-free is available, yay!), and the toppings: \"flora\" includes unconventional choices such as black beans and cilantro; \"fauna\" includes the usual meats plus hamburger; choice of 3 kinds of cheese - mozzarella, cheddar, feta; and red, white, or BBQ sauce. With so many good things to choose from, it was a tough choice for me but since I had just come from a gym workout I decided to go with one of the favorites: the superbiotic, and I ordered mine with gluten-free crust rather than their regular 10-grain crust. I loved how the individual flavors stood out - garlic, artichoke, red onion, cilantro, peppers ... a true gustatory (and healthy) delight! The crust was just a tad overly firm at the edges but that is a common characteristic of baked goods made from gluten-free dough, since wheat gluten is what gives baked goods their \"springy\" texture. I'm definitely a fan and look forward to future post-workout guilt-free tasty rewards from this place."}
{"text":"I love the pizzas here. The crust is positively delicious! I never get that nasty crash I do from other pizzas. The Superbiotic on skinny crust is my favorite! The staff here is always friendly and they have me coming back atleast 2-3 times a week! I've had delivery too and they're always prompt! Like they say when they answer the phone, \"It's a great day to get Naked!\""}
{"text":"This location is now closed."}
{"text":"So happy Naked Pizza chose Goodyear. I am reviewing the food and service, not parking! The Pizza was excellent, the delivery service was super-fast. The crust (Original) was unique and very tasty. The sauce was very natural tasting. The toppings tasted fresh and unfrozen.  To compare the price and style of this Pizza to Domino's, Pizza Hut or any of the big guys is unfair. The bottom line is this: If you don't care at all what you shove down your throat get Domino's or Papa Johns! Yes they are cheaper, but there is a reason. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese which is hardly even real food is cheaper than a fresh wild-caught salmon for example. The bottom line is this: If you want a tasty, fast, and best of all healthy pizza, get Naked. If you don't care about what you put in your body, get the big guys and keep eating HFCS, Sugar, Salt, and Fat! Did you know some pizza places have more than your entire daily value of sodium in just 1 or 2 slices of their pizza? Their pizza might be cheaper, but paying for your heart attack or stroke will most certainly eat up any savings!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This restaurant has not been open very long and certainly does not have all of the kinks ironed out.  That being said, it's Pizza and how hard can it be?  Ordered a large, \"skinny\" ancestral blend crust  Smokehouse (BBQ sauce, onion, dbl chicken.  Pizza was burned in some spots around the perimeter of the crust and pretty dry.  Flavor was just ok, I've certainly had better and will take Papa Murphy's over them any day of the week.  They seem to be trying to pull of a natural version of Papa Murphys with a \"whole foods\" slant.  It's take out only which is fine with me considering that we have a ton of great pizza places around 85083-Phoenix that are both sit down and take out."}
{"text":"We had 2 14 in pizzas tonight for dinner. We spent under $20 for 4 of us. The pizza was hot, the crust had a great crisp and nutty flavor. The toppings were a bit sparse, but overall the pizza tasted great and we felt better eating it than other brands. We will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"This chain is really something special.  I just wish there were more around.  I love that their pizzas are a healthy alternative to traditional ones.  I also love that their pizza doesn't leave me feeling sick and bloated.  I wouldn't say it is the best pizza ever but it does the trick.  The crust/cheese isn't perfect but it comes real close.  The online nutritional information is solid and I can't believe how the quality of their ingredients cuts down on the calorie/fat/carb/etc. content.  I can't wait to return but it probably won't be for a while because their locations aren't close to anything for me.  I purposely drove like 15 miles to pick up a pizza from here after hearing about it from Mark Cuban's Twitter feed.  However, it was worth the trip to get something healthy, delicious, and unique."}
{"text":"Pizza toppings feature a huge variety!  I went in two nights in a row.  The first night i tried the Sonoran Special (chicken/mushroom...).  It was delicious!  Very flavorful, like no other pizza I've tasted.  Then the next night I tried out a Superbiotic (several veggies) but I subbed out regular cheese for a soy cheese.  It was pretty gross, but I was curious.   It was too cheesy, I didn't like the texture.  I just stick to the regular cheese next time but yeah I hope this place stays because I really like it!  Did I mention the special crust??  Very yummy!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I were talking about this place the other night and it reminded me that I had been wanting to go for quite some time.  My husband and children LOVE pizza, for the most part I'm just meh about it.  I like weird pizzas, or pizzas with a lot of toppings, because as Rocco DiSpirito said in an episode of \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" (and I'm paraphrasing here) cheese pizza is a tough thing to master, the dough, the sauce, and the cheese have to be tip top the best, have to work together, or it bombs.  If one part is off, the whole thing is shit.  Anyway, back to Naked Pizza.  I try to eat pretty healthy, I do veer off track sometimes, but I try to avoid high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, all that loveliness that the food industry is trying to tell you is good for you (but isn't!)  My oldest child and I both have asthma, so we have to watch for nitrates and MSG in foods because it can aggravate it (if you have asthma and aren't watching for these things, cut them out and see how your condition improves for the most part!)  The sauce has no HFCS, the crust has no hydrogenated oils, and their meats are nitrate free.  Oh happy day!  I ordered a 12\" pepperoni pizza for the kiddos and a 10\" superbiotic for myself, with cheesy breadstixx with basil.  There were 2 kinds of Jones soda and Sweet Leaf brand sweet tea for grabs to drink, so I got 3 bottles of sweet tea and called it good.  It was $27 for the pizzas and breadsticks, with an additional $6 for the drinks.  I'm not against this price because a) I would easily spend this at other pizza places (I don't do Papa John's, Pizza Hut, or Domino's) and b) good food costs money.  They offer a military discount, which is lovely, and if you let them know it's your first time there they'll give you a 50% off coupon for your next visit.  I think this is pretty fantastic!  The food took time to cook, which was nice.  The people working there were friendly and chatted freely amongst themselves and with me while I waited.  I asked questions about the food and they answered them.  They let me know the meats were nitrate free, the crust has a low glycemic index (AMAZING!  You hear that diabetics?  You can have this pizza and not have to worry about blood sugar spikes!), and they use separate cutting utensils for the meat pizzas, vegetarian pizzas, and gluten free pizzas (low risk of cross contamination AND vegetarians don't have to worry about bacon grease on their pizza!)  I mean, they're making a food I felt guilty eating seem less bad, it's almost to the point where I can say, \"Hey, I'm doing something GOOD for me because I'm eating this pizza!\"  The pizza came and my kids rejoiced.  The pepperoni on the pizza was so teeny it was cute.  My kids called them baby pepperoni, but make no mistake, they didn't skimp on them!  There was glorious pools of tastiness in the curled up pepperoni that made me envy the metabolism of the young, but that didn't stop me from snagging a slice to try, for thoroughness of my review, of course!  The cheesy breadstixx were glorious!  There was SO MUCH CHEESE on it, and the basil was so tasty.  I wasn't crazy about the dipping sauce, but my kids loved it to dip their crust in (they usually don't eat pizza crust, so score one for Naked Pizza!)   The Superbiotic pizza is like the veggie special at most pizza places, with the added awesomeness of artichokes, spinach, and garlic.  There wasn't a ton of cheese on it, suffocating the veggie goodness, and those bites of artichoke hearts were fantastic.  You could taste the veggies, they weren't smothered in cheese.  Some may view this as a con, but it's a pro in my book.  Being able to taste the garlic in a pizza is important to me, I LOVE garlic, and I hate when something says there's garlic in it but you can't taste it.  Such a letdown!  The garlic shown through and was noticeable, but not overpowering.  The pepperoni pizza was solid.  It wasn't completely covered in pepperoni like some places (I'm looking at you Papa John's, gross!), hiding their sauce's inadequacies behind pork fat (which in it's defense does cover up many indiscretions in cooking.)  The spices in the sauce are noticeable, the cheese isn't overpowering, and the pepperoni is slightly spicy and delicious.  The edges curled up and got crispy, which I love.  I would definitely recommend Naked Pizza to friends and family.  I really enjoyed the pizza, the employees were helpful and friendly, and it wasn't too expensive, in my opinion.  I can't think of any reason to take a star away."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, but not worth the price. We tried both the small omnivore pizza and the Pima pizza.  I thought the pizza crust was grainy and a little mushy for my taste. Also,Pizza did not have enough sauce, in my opinion.  I liked the omnivore over the Pima which tasted like store bought pizza.  Not too excited about the store design either since it does not allow for inside sitting.  Outside sitting is ok in the winter but the other half of the year, the arizona summer's are not inviting to outside sitting. To me this seems like a critical flaw for this location."}
{"text":"The TRUTH is Freaky chemicals ARE ADDED to fortified the \"healthy pizza\"   I have a problem with no freaky chemicals are added as the website says but the truth is they do add probiotics to the crust.  We've recently tried the thin crust pizzas and found the crust flavorless sort of like a matzoh cracker but sort of like a tortilla with a burnt edge.  The sauce is almost flavorless , how do you take out flavor from tomatoes? I don't know? I threw my own seasonings on to make it taste better.  Mozzarella cheese that is lightly topping the pizza is almost flavorless.  I think this is extremely expensive considering you only get a (basically) 10in tortilla for $7.50 with almost nothing on it if you order one topping. This pizza wasn't filling one bit either for the first time in my life I ate a whole pizza. (I normally only eat one or two slices maybe three if I am pigging and the pieces are small)  We are not fans and my husband had high anger issues after trying this pizza he kept screaming to me to only give one star but I think maybe it deserves two stars?  only because it isn't as bad as others I've tried near here , at best I think this is only suitable for appetizers when you are having guest if you can't cook.  ALSO ONLY TAKE OUT OR DELIVERY no sit in dining"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER EATEN !!!!  Amazingly fast, friendly delivery of the most amazing pizza EVER !!!  There is no other pizza joint for me.  Ahwatukee rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Just had a really great customer service experience that prompted me to write this. My bf and I LOVE the pizza here.. We love their concept, the freshness & flavor- have no complaints- except it's a bit on the pricey side. Last night we decided to order some for dinner. I checked their website to see that they close at 10pm. Great!! I scheduled a pick-up for 9:30pm. Turns out when I got there- they CLOSED @ 9pm!! Dang you inaccurate website!! Needless to say, we were disappointed & hungry. This afternoon, to my surprise & delight I received a call from Emery Esparza from Naked Pizza. She informed me that she saw my order and had forwarded it to the web people responsible for updating their hours. She called to personally apologize for the mistake and inconvenience. She then offered to comp our order from the night before. Tonight, we enjoyed a DELICIOUS, satisfying Superbiotic pizza! I have to say we're impressed at how the situation was handled so had to share our great experience. What exceptional customer service! It's very sad they will be closing soon!!"}
{"text":"My review is a bit overdue seeing as how we actually ordered from Naked Pizza a few weeks ago.  Had some friends over for game 7 of the NBA finals and had been wanting to try out this place. So we called in an order and brought it back. We ordered the Mediterranean, the Farmvil and a plain cheese pizza. We weren't given a crust option so thin is what we got, paper thin.  The ingredients were all really good quality. But the sauce didn't really stand out, and to me, that's the most crucial ingredient.  There's really nothing else in the immediate area to compete with Naked Pizza, business-wise, but I don't really think this place will be a huge success. I'll probably give it another go sometime down the line, but a couple nights ago I opted to drive a little bit out of the way for a better pie, and better value. It's a bit overpriced for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Pizza was not what I expected could have made at home with kit from store for less.  Pizza had no toppings and was greesey. When is phoenix going to get a pizza place that its afforadable and quality."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great quality, awesome prices, fast delivery and really great customer service. They have custom pizzas but our favorite is the lg thin crust pima. Jalapenos, chicken, cheddar cheese and black beans! Couldn't be better."}
{"text":"X"}
{"text":"My parents and I went here because we had a Groupon.  I was pretty excited to try it out since it is so close to my house and my previous favorite pizza joint wasn't cutting it.  This place was a major let down and I will not be going back there.  Meal:  I had a 12\", original crust pizza with olives, ham, and mozzarella cheese.    Taste:  This was perhaps the most bland pizza I have ever had.  The crust didn't seem like it was cooked all the way . . . this is just a guess but I think it was a frozen crust.  I think a 2x4 with salt sprinkled on would have more depth and interesting flavors than this pizza.  4 out of 10.  Value:  Had it not been for the Groupon, this would have been way too expensive.  This place is crazy expensive and it really feels like they nickle and dime you.  2 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The people who work there are incredibly nice and they sure got the pizza out quick.  The person who took my order was the only real bright spot during the experience.  10 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  It is a cute place but it would be nice if they had a place to sit down and eat.  I think if they did this, it would be a half way decent place to get lunch.  2 out of 5.  Overall:  Skip this place.  The food is not good and the value is just as bad.  I would go here if it was the last pizza place in the east valley.  18 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Naked pizza?  WTF is that?  That is what I thought!  Naked pizza = all natural pizza.  The crust is made of 10 grains plus prebiotic agave fiber and probiotics.  Let's just say, the crust is GOOD and good for you.    The storefront is just counter, soda case, and order your pizza.  The menu is on the wall.  It is modern and super clean.  No tables to sit and eat inside but there are a few small tables and chairs outside.    I ordered the 14\" classic with pepperoni.  The crust was so good, the cheese (is that what natural real cheese taste like?), and pepperoni (pretty good).  The price is not bad for an all natural pizza that is good for you."}
{"text":"This place screams, \"NO\"!    Indoor seating?  No.  I ate outside in the heat.    Water?  No.  I asked for a cup of water with my meal and was told they only have bottled water and soda for sale.    Straws?  No.  I walked to Safeway to get a gatorade and they don't even have a straw for me to use.    Can I use the Now Groupon for a 14\" pizza?  No.  Only good for the 12\".  The groupon wasn't clear and the cashier didn't tell me that until after I ordered and bought the Groupon, which I told him about when I walked in the door.    To add insult to injury, all toppings cost extra.  some are $1.90 each.  Plan to spend a lot of money and be underwhelmed with mediocre pizza if you don't head the warnings posted here."}
{"text":"I want this pizza to be better than it is, if they could change a few things it probably would be as good as they claim.   I gave them a fair shake and waited to write this review after ordering from them 4 times.   Thin crust Pizza should be CRISP, mine was a soggy undercooked mess drowning in sauce, and skimping on toppings.   Original crust Pizza was also undercooked and drowning in sauce with a lack of toppings, some of which they even forgot.   -PLEASE use a light hand when saucing the pizzas and don't just squirt a pile of BBQ sauce on from the bottle, it should be evenly applied with a ladle and a swirl too.    How does the pizza have time to cook when it arrives literally 15 minutes after I hang up the phone?  I'm more concerned about quality than I am about your speedy delivery.   -PLEASE take the time to thoroughly cook those pizzas!   It seems when I order a pizza with meat for my man it's loaded with meat but when I order a veggie one for myself they tend to be stingy, especially with mushrooms for some reason.   -PLEASE be generous with the veggies if I order a pizza with no cheese or meat!   Fresh Herbs mean just that, FRESH, but when they are put on the pizza before baking they shrivel up and dry out and lose all flavor.   -PLEASE Put Herbs on the Pizza once it has come out of the oven!!    One more thing, PLEASE have your phone staff go through some more training.   I'm not giving up on you NAKED, but next time I order it will have to be in person so things are done right.   Let's get those stars up!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, organic food and courteous staff make this place an awesome lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Holy best pizza I've ever had, Batman! I was curious about this place...probably because I've been bombarded by Naked advertising for the past year or so. I was a bit wary about the price, but I understand that I get what I pay for...blah blah blah.   I read their spiel about the all-natural ingredients and how their quality compares to the big chains. I'm still a major skeptic and require proof of all things before I believe anything. So, we ordered our pizzas today at 5pm. They arrived at 5:22. No, I'm not exaggerating. I was blown away. Not only do they have pizza ovens that defy the laws of physics, they own transporters that beam them to your front door a la Captain Kirk. All I know is if my kids are playing outside when I order from there, I'll be sure to bring them in within 15 minutes so they don't get plowed over by the delivery guy's car. (No, I don't think this is a plus but, damn, they were fast. I just wish they could be fast and safe!)  Aaaaaaaaaaanyway, when I opened the box, I have to admit I was disappointed. It didn't look like a 14 inch pizza. My husband whipped out his...tape measure and...what? .... Whatever. Point is, it really IS 14 inches.   So, I took a bite. There were no fireworks, nor did my taste buds dance like Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompas. (I always have that picture in my head when I eat food that is just \"to die for\".) It was...well, it was good. It was definitely different than the pizza we usually order (Pizza Hut). I finished my first slice and went back for seconds. No sense in judging it on one piece, right? The second piece was even better than the first, and the third, well, let's just say that the more I ate, the better it tasted. I don't know why. That's just what happened. Maybe it's like Starbucks who put heroin in the coffee cup lids. You don't know why you love it. You just do, and the more you have it, the more you want it. I'm serious. Heroin in the lids. It's true. I looked it up on snopes.  Back to the pizza.  The bottom line is: If you want really good pizza and you don't mind paying a little more for food that is not over-processed, artery-clogging garbage, this is the place to get it. It would be nice if they threw out a coupon or two though."}
{"text":"I guess I'm used to the PPP sauce and stringy/meling cheese!    This place was clean, had teenagers at the register and they were very friendly and courteous.  Service was also quick and even had some stickers for the kiddos to stay occupied as we waited.  Food: The dough tastes like an earthy wheat nutty flavor.  It was good and the kids actually ate the ends from the pizza.  Wish we had sauce for dipping.  The cheese was not melty, we don't live far, so it was still warm but I guess I was hoping for a sticky cheese falling off the pizza with a little sauce coming off the sides as I took a bite.....nope, the pizza lacked a bit of sauce and some additional flavor would've been great like salt or oregano or tomatoe.  Pepperoni was super thin, like we could see through it, would've liked a little more of that as well.  The kids were excited to try \"healthy pizza\" and we had the special with a coupon, so less than $20 for a large 2topping with a side salad.  Pizza is meant to be eaten the unhealthy way though!"}
{"text":"I, fortunately, had an experience unlike Andrew G's. We live in the area and got the flyer at our front door, as well as saw the sign twirlers on the street corner, letting us know they were now open. I ordered our 2 pies online on a Saturday evening and had no issues. No coupons, but that was okay, as the prices are reasonable as is. When I picked up my pizzas, they had just been boxed. There were several customers in the store, as well as several employees. A couple we looking over the menu, one talking with a couple employees, and a few at the 3 iPads they have against the wall. I'm not sure what they all are for, but I do know you can place your order through them. The staff was friendly and attentive and even suggested that I register my email to receive specials and updates (so maybe coupons will be coming around!).   The pizzas were tasty and not heavy. The pepperoni was thinly sliced, so some pieces were pretty crisp (which is a good thing). I find some pizza joints have a sweet sauce and/or crust, but Naked's was not either. The crust was soft, and although it had the \"healthy-full-of-grains\" taste, it was very good. The original crust was not thick at all - maybe other joints would even consider it to be equivalent to their \"thin\" crust.  I love pizza, and I am glad to have a good place so convenient to home (yes, there is Brother's, but their pizzas contain too much sugar)!  P.S. Take out or delivery only."}
{"text":"We always have great experiences here. We used to come in to pick up the pizzas, and it was always kind of awkward (the staff was kind of awkward anyway, and the design inside is weird... tons of wasted space lol.) But other than that, no complaints. We usually just order for delivery now, and they are always on time or early, never late. Delivery people are hit or miss, sometimes very friendly or sometimes also awkward :P Or just silent... I like silent though, so that's not a negative haha.  The pizza is usually delicious, depending on how busy they are. If it's a busy night, I'm sure they're just rushing through pizzas and don't do as great of a job as they should. However, usually it seems like they do a great job because the pizzas are delicious. Their thin crust is great! We've tried most of their different kinds of specialty pizzas, although sometimes it's cheaper if you just make your own with the same ingredients as they list under their specialty orders. We especially love their BBQ sauce, which sounded kind of weird at first but actually tastes amazing on a pizza. Even just a regular Pepperoni pizza here tastes better than other places! Plus, it's \"healthier,\" organinc, and all that... But you really can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients.  On that note, the prices are higher than other places. You get what you pay for though... but I must add that this place always has great deals going on. I think we only paid full price for a pizza once or twice. The rest of the time, we've been getting deals like 50% off, $10 larges with unlimited toppings, etc. You just have to watch out for the good deals! Once you factor those in, the prices are pretty great! However, paying full/regular price is ridiculous to me... they are pricey for what you get! (The large isn't all that huge, for example.)  Overall, quirky name and marketing system, quirky employees, delicious food, and often discounts. 4 stars for this place."}
{"text":"Ahh the my favorite food mmm pizza! I have never tried Naked Pizza until today.  The things you should know about this establishment is that they pride themselves on all natural ingredients and not using filler biproducts to make there food. So it is good for the vegetarian or a person who just like fresh ingredients. I know I do. For the price of the product you cannot go wrong. It can be anywhere from $5.99 to about $15.00 depending on what you get.  They have tons of toppings so the sky is the limit as far as getting creative with your pie. I had mine delivered and boy was I glad. You might as well have it delivered because these guys are lightening quick. I placed my order at 5:40  and My promised time was at 6:02 and she got here at 5:57!! I could never pick up a pizza and then drive home that quick. The pizza was fresh and tasted good when I got it, no burnt edges or anything. I don't how they started out but I can tell you they have fixed the kinks. One thing I can say is that there sauce could be more zesty, but that is the only knock I give this place. Awesome job and awesome service I definitely will be ordering here again."}
{"text":"I love good pizza. That's why Naked Pizza frustrates me. It's a great idea. Healthy pizza with wholesome, organic ingredients. Convenient to order and pickup (no dine-in available). But after numerous attempts the only this about Naked Pizza that is consistent is its inconsistency. The crust is generally good, the sauce is tasty. But when it comes to toppings it's like placing a bet on a roulette wheel because you never know what you'll get.  Last night we got an email as part of their promotional program. Great prices on large and medium 1-topping pizzas. We ordered two. Got them home, opened the box and there was literally one ingredient on each slice of pizza. One.   Now I can understand profit margins are tight but in my opinion, if you can't produce a quality pizza for the price you're offering in your promotion, then don't do it. As the meal went on, we weren't talking about how much we liked the pizza or the restaurant's concept, we were talking about what a disappointment it was. That's too bad. We have had occasions in the past where the pizza was loaded with cheese and healthy toppings but it would usually be followed up with a pizza that was all sauce, no cheese and little toppings on the next.   For a takeout place, Naked Pizza is turning out to be a lot like Deal or No Deal. You're excited about the possibility about getting something good but there's a pretty good chance you're going to walk away disappointed too.   I really hope they realize their potential and as time goes on they iron out the bumps and standardize the quality. It's one thing to save 30¢ on ingredients on a pizza but it costs a whole lot more to attract and keep new customer. I only hope they learn that lesson before it's too late. I think I'll wait a few months before giving them one last try."}
{"text":"Try superbiotic pizza with daiya cheeze! It's my fav vegan pizza!"}
{"text":"We decided to head to Naked Pizza on a Friday night and found the location to be in a strip mall. We soon found that the restaurant wasn't really a restaurant but more of a storefront where you placed and picked up your order, with the exception of several small tables just outside the door. Upon entering the location was open and bright with their menu posted largely on the wall.Basically you choose the size of the pizza, crust thickness, choice of sauce, choice of cheese. and additional toppings.  As with most pizza places there are \"specialty\" pizzas to choose from too.   Within 15 minutes of ordering our pizzas were ready and we chowed down.I definitely noticed a difference versus regular ol' pizza in the crust alone.  The ancestral blend was definitely grainy in texture and different than what I was used to.  With that being said, it was pretty darn delicious.  As always, when vegan cheese is an option I'm pretty happy about it.   I think Naked Pizza could grow in many ways if a few ideas were considered.  Have a more spacious area for dine-in eating and provided plates and utensils for those interested in dining in.  We literally had to eat out of our boxes since no plates were provided."}
{"text":"There seems to be three types of pizza.  Chicago style, New York style, and the pizza that we actually buy and eat.  These days you go to a pizza joint and ask for thin crust and they say, \"Sure, we've got non-existent crust.\"  And you say, \"Yeah, I'll get the non-existent crust.\" Maybe I'm watching my weight; maybe I just don't like that much bread underneath my cheese; maybe it's none of your business.  And they say, \"Yeah, that's good because our crust sucks.\" So it's great that there's actually a pizza joint where I can get some crust with character - crust with taste.  And the fact that I can get a slightly healthier pizza for my daughter is a plus that is hard to pass up as she could live off of pizza if one could actually live off of eating only mushroom pizza.  How a five-year old ever convinced herself to like mushrooms I'll never know.  My wife loves the skinny pizza with pineapple, feta cheese, hold the mozzarella, jalapenos, and onions.  Yeah, I know, that pizza makes even less sense than a five year old eating mushrooms.  Personally, I'm settling on a peperoni and basil combo with full crust."}
{"text":"I already eat a \"natural\" minimally processed foods kind of diet. I read the ingredients on the food labels...yes, I'm one of those weirdos. I like to shop at Sprouts.  I was thrilled that I could have pizza without the crappy nitrites in the processed meats...or have the option of having gluten-free crust.  Yeah for NAKED pizza!!! I ordered a Naked Pizza online...which was convenient.  The thing that really SUCKS is that this location is \"sandwiched\" in between a Subway & Wildflower Bread Co. (yes, I made a pun!) and therefore the PARKING situation is what SUCKS! Plus, there was a line inside of 4-5 people waiting while the two cashiers juggled phone orders.  The pizza was DRY...more dry than eating a saltine cracker. I think there was some sauce...why the heck was the pizza so DRY?  With tax, the Ragin' Cajun pizza (Garlic, Chicken, Sausage, Peppers, and Onions) was almost $19 bucks for a 14\"...$3 more if you want gluten-free. How many pizzas could I get at Dominoes for that price? $19 for a dry pizza is not a good value....natural or not.  I'm glad I tried it, great concept, but I probably wouldn't eat here again. I could get a tasty wood-burning pizza at Sal's Tuscan Grill for less, which is just around the corner from Naked pizza."}
{"text":"I am trying to be kind, but not a great experience, online, in person, or dining with/at NakedPizza.  I had gotten their flyer extoling all their virtues before the holiday break recently, and so the weekend seemed like a good time to try them.  No online coupons, nor flyer coupons, but I tried both regular and thin crust with both pepperoni and mushroom toppings.  I used their website, which was not especially intuitive, nor fast on updates-- as compared to other pizza places--  and it ended up getting the order wrong, so I called the place and they could not modify the order at all, and ended up doing an entire new order, cheerfully.  They got the total wrong, but then adjusted it with a managers [?] help.    My pizzas were ready ontime, however, there seemed to be a lack of individuals who were able to help me.  While quite a few of the employees were standing around near the front desk, they did not offer to help, nor seemed to be doing anything in the back.  When one of the front counter girls got free from phone, they did give me the pizzas and I was on my way.  Alas, after all the hype and wait above, both pizza's, while warm, and reasonably fresh, did not taste it.  The touted 12 grain crust actually tasted like bad wheat bread, with very little flavor.  The sauce was nearly invisible, and did not add to the pizza.  Same for rest of toppings -- basically a very dull, if neutral note.  Neither crust was crispy, nor tasty, or had any good texture to it.  I can not blame the company, as perhaps this is their \"all natural way\"  but when compared to many other pizza places, both cheap and expensive I have been to, I can not ever recommend this place/their pizza's again.  It was not just me, I had friends over, and the vote was uniamious, with the comment  \"Freschetta frozen is better than this!\"  I am trying to think of any redeeming values, but I can not.  I think you should avoid this place, and seek your pizza nirvana elsewhere -- Pizzeria Bianco is quite good, as is Grimaldi's [the one by BluBurger and Flemings]"}
{"text":"Yum! We got a little flier put on our door alerting us that this place had opened right down the street. We kinda forgot about it, but one night we had a hankering for some pizza and I was too lazy to make it. I am very picky about pizza. It's gotta be a healthy crust, healthy toppings....pretty much an all around healthy pizza. This place was super yummy and the price was good too! We will def go there again!"}
{"text":"This place opened in April, 2011.  I honestly don't think it will be here long.  They've done a good job of hanging doorknob flyers and having a guy stand out on Elliot Road waving a sign, so they got my attention and I took the plunge and bought a pizza.  The premise is that an all-natural pizza will be fundamentally better than one made from non-organically produced food products.  I beg to differ and they've proven me correct.  I called the order in and when they told me the pizza would be ready in 10 minutes I thought \"Wow, either they already have this in the oven, or they're taking a shortcut.\"  No, they aren't psychic...   ...which means...  I got to the shop a couple minutes before the pizza emerged from the standard conveyor belt pizza oven commercial establishments use these days.  I'm thinking that to make the pizza totally hip and cool they would use a charcoal fired oven, using fuel from a sustainable second growth wood plantation.  Not a chance.  This franchise would close even sooner if they had.  After getting home 5 minutes later, my kids (college age) and I partook of the pie.  The crust is good in that it's whole wheat and has a nice \"chew\" to it with a nutty wheat taste.  It isn't the typical Pizza-Rut \"so-much-grease-it-fries\" crust, but a good yeasty bread crust.  That's where the goodness ends.  I bought one of their \"favorites\" products (I'm not divulging which, as they have my name and phone #, and I'm certain it wouldn't take long to figure out who ordered what), and it was in a word, bland.  I mean, the CostCo Combo at $10 is a tastier pie, and a similarly priced Nello's pie puts this one to shame.  To their credit they do offer a gluten-free crust for those who need one.  I'm not one of those people and I have no motivation to get a gluten-free crust.  Sorry.    In summary, for one night I actually ate somewhat healthy, but long term I'm keeping my clothes on."}
{"text":"The pizza base/crust tastes really earthy. The pizza otherwise is meh - the toppings were sparse, the cheese was sparse, and we ordered another with extra feta cheese  which also seemed as sparse as the original, and we didn't see anything special, just the same stuff that domino's dishes out on a better crust."}
{"text":"I'm going to get right at it.  My family is Gluten Free and often eat at a a neigboring resturant for Gluten Free Pizza which is not the cheepest option.  That said I was excited to try Naked Pizza.  It is not price commpetitive with it's competition.  The pizza crust is terrible in comparison.  I'm sure they don't use a \"brick oven.\"  Similar to other reviews my entire family was less than enthused about the taiste of the pizza.  Our perspecitve is different from other reviews whom I'm sure they are comparing perhaps to \"non Gluten Free\" options and of course there is a difference.  In our case we fully expect a Dairy Free, Veegan, Gluten free product and felt that the price per topings and quality of crust was not worth it.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Whole grain pizza!! Great for all the health nuts.  You will love this place if you prefer brown rice over white rice or whole wheat over white bread.  This is no gourmet pizza though.  My pizza was ready for pickup 5 minutes after I placed my order online.  They have delivery and pickup options.   The online ordering process was very quick and simple to use.      I tried the thin and standard crust.  The thin crust was very crispy and super flat.  The standard crust is a little thicker but was quite dry.  It was a bit difficult to eat.  They have a good selection of toppings and choice of sauce.  Great concept but I'm not a fan of the taste."}
{"text":"We got a menu left on our door for this place and I was very surprised when I called and found out that we were actually in their delivery area since they are almost 6 miles away. So, we decided to give them a try. I love finding new places that are willing to deliver food to me!   I thought the pizza was great. The hubby was skeptical when I told him it was \"healthy\" pizza but he really liked it too. We got a bbq chicken on the regular crust and also a sonoran with sausage on thin crust. Both were really good. It does cost more than the big delivery chains but I think the quality is much better as well. Since you can get lots more toppings besides the usual stuff (fresh basil and cilantro, jalepenos, black beans, artichokes, and sundried tomatoes... yum!). I would say it is more on par with the Sauce chain of pizza places and it is also a comparable price. And I thought that the bbq chicken was just as good as California Pizza Kitchen's. Even if it was not the absolute best pizza I have ever had in my life, it was cheap and fast and the real advantage is that they are healthy. My husband commented that he ate more slices than he normally would; since the crust was thin it takes more to get full. But when I compared the calorie count to the info on Pizza Hut's website, it was still over a hundred calories less for the total meal. And you are getting the benefits of the lower fat, more fiber and added probiotics. That is really important since he is diabetic.   Both the person I spoke to on the phone and the delivery driver were friendly and competent. Overall, I give it two thumbs up. This may be our new go-to pizza delivery place."}
{"text":"This is our to go pizza place. Love the ideology of organic, natural, good for you pizza. When going for a quick dinner, we can get gluten free for my husband and son who have gluten allergies and vegan for me. I can also guarantee that my son isn't getting all those nasty extra ingredients found everywhere else that aren't exactly healthy. Prices are ok, if you don't add everything to the pizza, it's lower then most other places. I have only found one good deal on it tho, so I'm wondering where i can get this 50% off!"}
{"text":"Let's put it this way...   I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza.  I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10.  So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket.  The good?  The garlic topping is delicious.  The employees were friendly.  They were generous with their toppings.      The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough.  If you're off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese.  It will probably be a lot better!  The just okay?  The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry.  The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other.    This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers.  Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10\" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin.  My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was).    I am only rating this pizza two stars versus one because I can see that it would be \"better\" without the Daiya cheese that I chose to have on the pizza instead of mozzarella."}
