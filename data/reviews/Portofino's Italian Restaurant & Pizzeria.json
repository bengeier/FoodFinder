{"text":"Great Italian food! Add this place to your must go to list!!"}
{"text":"When you can't make it to Italy for a slice of pie, the next best thing is the pizza at Portofino's. Fresh cheese, just the right amount of sauce and handmade dough combine to create the perfect slice of pizza with a semi-salty bite. 
 On more than one occasion I have created dinner out of a slice of $2 cheese pizza and a tossed salad with their House dressing, that is hands down the best dressing in town. I have no idea what they put in it, but it keeps me coming back!  
 Oh, and the cannolis are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant - wish they were located in Mint Hill... I typically order the Tortellini Gorgonzola, Puttanesca and add chicken, or I order their chicken and steak cheesesteak subs. Their food is always delicious, portions are good, prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"During the last several years, this restaurant has been in slow decline. From the Quality of their food to their prices. $ 12.95 for a Dozen Wings (Not Full Wings, but pieces). Pasta (Bolognese) was very bitter. MeatBalls: $3.50. Coke was flat, asked for a replacement of sweet tea. Still charged for Flat Coke.  
Last Time for my wife and I. We used to love this place, but things change over time, and not necessarily for the better."}
{"text":"You just can't find a better pizza in Charlotte for the $ than at Portofino's.  

Their large cheese for $13.00 feeds my family of five, and a few side salads with their awesome house dressing, and we are all set. Its a weekly tradition I in my house.  

I have a tendency to carry out, but every time we have eaten in over the years, we havethoroughly enjoyed the service, and have had some very tasty pasta dishes as well.  

As noted elsewhere, this is not a fancy or pretentious place, just great food served by people who work hard to make the best italian meal you can find for the price in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really great Italian food and decent prices for the flavor and quantity. Really great customer service especially going there an hour before close. Seafood dish portions are worth it. Also love the spicy marina sauce.  Even though it is located in a strip mall, dining experience is great!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for Italian food.  I love the Pizza and the salad with house dressing is where it's at."}
{"text":"I've only come here for lunch and always to go, but each time I get two slices of plain Sicilian and its by far the best Sicilian pizza I've had in NC. Fantastic food, friendly people. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Good customer service will trump good food all the time. Someone should teach the manager on duty Andrew this....I've been a customer for 5 years, now I will never return."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the 28205 and surrounding areas. Authentic Italian dudes running this joint and reminds me of the pizzerias I grew up with in NY. I usually stick with their pizza, however I've had a few pasta dishes here and loved them as well."}
{"text":"I ventured to Portofino's yesterday evening and so glad I did. I had the Marechare Tilapia special which included ,mussels, clams, scallops in a light white wine marinaria sauce. Yummy."}
{"text":"First time to this location of Portofino's and they don't disappoint! I had the Arrabbitia entree with capellini today and it was great."}
{"text":"We moved to Charlotte several months ago, and we have frequented Portofino's at Eastway many times! The service here is always outstanding. If you don't see something on the menu that appeals to you, they are extremely willing to create something specifically for you. The shrimp scampi is super tasty with huge shrimp. Love this establishment!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a household where every Friday night was pizza night. I still crave a good slice (or 3) on Fridays. Portofino's has great hand-tossed thin crust pizza. They use a tomato sauce that is light and has a great flavor. I usually do carry-out and appreciate that there is a separate counter and cash register for this. Portofino's is a solid choice in our Friday-night-pizza lineup."}
{"text":"It was delicious. The pizza was tasty and crust was fresh. Lasagna was just ok. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for about 10years, and I have eaten at Portofinos for 10years. I have nevered had anything but a large pepperoni pizza.. And their pizza is AMAZING. Perfect, thin, great sauce gooey cheese and just enough spice to the pepperoni. Perfection in a slice. The service is always great, I always like to sit at the counter to watch them while they cook. The owner is really funny and loud and Italian. Perfect ambiance. Recently I had the pasta puttanesca for the first time, all I can say is Mmmmm. Chock full of olives, capers, chunks of garlic and tomatoes, it was sheer heaven on a plate. My penne noodles were cooked perfectly, not too mushy or hard. It was a great meal with salad and bread sticks. To be honest, I still had to take a pizza home as well, its that good."}
{"text":"Portofino's is my favorite Italian Restaurant to eat at hands down. Everything from pastas to pizzas are complete bliss. The prices are pretty normal, and you certainly get your money's worth. Very classy atmosphere, great waiters and waitresses and, once again, incredible food! Definitely a must-eat-at kinda place (:"}
{"text":"Just a whole bunch of yum going on at Portofino's. 

Arrived at the South park location at 6:30 on a Friday - they don't take reservations- and the place was already pretty busy for dinner, but we were able to be seated right away.


Attentive service.
Huge portions ( like 2 meals worth of leftovers huge)
Delicious specials

Although the pasta dishes looked fantastic, I opted for the Seafood Pescatore special. Risotto with a touch of marinara and laden with fruits from the sea - including a half filet of salmon on top.

It was divine as was the Ahi Tuna special served with a side of polenta with a creamy pepper sauce.

Delicious bread and decent wine list rounded out the dining experience.
.
If you're in the mood for Italian, head to Portofino's.
And go hungry or stay home!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing! The crust is tasty and the sauce adds just the right amount of dimension. The cheese is the perfect match of cheesy  and chewy. The options are vast, veggie, meat, and a great pizza with prosciutto too. You can't go wrong here. As unassuming as Portofinos seems, it's well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Definitely a monthly go to spot. Great service. Extremely generous portions and fair prices. Neighborhood is dicey but once u was
In you feel at home. Reminds me of a New York neighborhood joint. Love the pizza but the pastas are the stars. Love the manager as Well. Never forgets a face, takes custom orders and always has a smile."}
{"text":"I used to work in this part of town and I miss eating here regularly. Whenever the old Shamrock crowd gets together, we meet here because:
1. Best pizza in town, regular cheese or white pizza, lots of toppings too;
2. Great pasta dishes - capellini primavera, linguini with clam sauce, lasagna;
3. warm, fresh bread with butter or evoo;
4. Nice salads and a delicious house dressing;
5. easily seats large groups;
6. friendly, attentive service;
7. large extensive menu (and I always say that I am going to try something new but I always order my usual 'cause it's been too long since I have had it!)
Someday I am going to order the cheesesteak because I've read so much about it.
I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time visit, though we've lived in the area for 2+ years. Expected very typical red-sauce place, but was happily surprised all around with quality of the food and variety!  Very friendly and attentive service, just what you'd hope for in a truly neighborhood place. Food was very good, two adults had pasta - linguine was high quality and cooked to al dente greatness, sauces were yummy, portions were (overly) plentiful. only suggestion for the Brasciola sauce was more peas! As all the other favorable reviews said, the bread was outstanding (pizza bakers know how to make great bread). We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Portofino's is a hidden gem, wedged in a corner of a slightly sketchy strip mall.  The food is fantastic and extremely affordable.  We live down the street and I always forget Portofino's is so close, not anymore!  It was sooo good!

 A pasta dish runs about $11 and is a sizable portion.  The bruchetta was good, the tomatoes were a little boring (not enough garlic or spices) but the bread was perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  

The pink sauce is absolutely freakin' fantastic.  it comes with peas and crunchy prosciutto. It is rich, creamy and has a perfect bite from the parmesan sprinkled on top.  I kept having to smack my boyfriends fork away after I gave him a taste, he kept trying to sneak more, he even kept trying to dunk bread into the sauce!  I am totally hooked on it.  

The pizza prices are very reasonable, I plan on checking their pizza out next."}
{"text":"My go to Italian spot! I've never been disappointed by this place. The location is a bit odd, but whatever. The service is attentive & quick. My favorite is their baked ziti. For only $10 you get a huge helping, plus a salad & bread. Plus they put green olives on their salad..its the little things for me."}
{"text":"Bring your own ranch! They charge $1.00 for ranch. Food is OK but service SUX. E for effort."}
{"text":"The Eastway location is one of our favorite places in Charlotte!!! My wife like a dish called chicken romano (I think). It has potatoes, bacon and mushrooms in a sort of cream sauce. It is a special, not on the menu. Absolutely decadent. Whenever she wants it we call first. If they don't have everything they need, they will go to the store and get it, so we can order it when we arrive. ( we call several hours in advance)
How many places today will go that far out of their way to please one person? 

I've never had a bad meal there!! 

GO!! you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with recommended review from yelp.  Yes, this is a good place.  Wine @$5/glass reasonable.  The waiter was very professional and helpful to my friend who didn't know what to order.  
The food is very good and the portion is good size and we enjoy the bread that I dipped with olive oil.
Definitely I will come back again."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte. Great food with large portions. During dinner entrees include fresh baked bread and a salad. I recommend the house salad with their homemade salad dressing. The chicken Parmesan is my favorite and I modify with spicy marinara. My husband loves the shrimp fra diavolo. We always have leftovers and usually order a pizza to go.  We love love love their pizzas! NY style and best in town!"}
{"text":"I had visited the Portofino's on Park Rd several years ago and wasn't wowed.  It was just okay Italian.  I also wasn't crazy about the atmosphere...or lack thereof.  

So when my partner suggested we try out the Portofino's on Eastway for lunch one day, I was very skeptical.  \"The rundown plaza in the sketchy part of town where even Walmart moved out of?\" was my response.  We went for lunch and I was literally blown away.  While the location and plaza it's in is suspect, walking into Portofino's, I felt much more assured.  It offered a nice, quaint atmosphere, much better than the one on Park Rd, I think.   We were immediately greeted by several smiling staff members and the dining room was already starting to fill up with people on their lunch breaks.  

Although Portofino's has a large authentic Italian menu with very reasonable prices already, we both opted for one of their equally reasonably priced lunch specials.  My partner had the mushroom ravioli with a reddish cream sauce.  I tried the sauce (I'm not a fan of fungi) and it was delicious and very flavorful.  I ordered the gnocchi special with tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic, and basil.  It, too, had a sauce that was oh-so-flavorable.  It wasn't exactly creamy, but close to it.  I absolutely loved it.  

We also ordered small Caesar salads to start (for not much more) and our server brought us some delicious warm bread that we finished up by sopping up our leftover sauces.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience and our server was super-efficient and very friendly.  I have a newfound respect for Portofino's on Eastway.  I can't say I'd go there at nighttime, but during daylight hours, I'd be happy to any day of the week."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant with a good menu. A bit pricey compared to other restaurants in the immediate area, but a better restaurant. A nice place to take the family for a special occasion.

They also offer take-out, and have a separate take-out counter. I like their pizza."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the person in charge, some bald-headed man with an Italian accent, was so disrespectful to one of the servers working there. I felt like crying for her. She was obviously shaken up by his screaming at her. I don't know what happened but no one deserved to be yelled at and degraded like he did to her. Shame on him! Nothing but a bully!"}
{"text":"I just moved into the Elizabeth area from Dilworth. As a realtor I go out to dinner with clients a lot. My friends kept saying go to Portofino'sso Friday night, 2-19-2016 we all went to see the place I must try. I knew about this restaurant for many years but just never went.

I just want to say the pizza was amazing!! We ordered the large half pepperoni and supreme. The crust was thin and crispy (not burnt) light sauce and just enough cheese. The topping were fresh and tasty. I got the small house salad  it was great, fresh ingredients with balsamic dressing plus you get amazing bread.

I will be back fantastic restaurant! 

The area was fine (not shady) this is the original restaurant the other one is off Park Rd."}
{"text":"Perfect spot if you want a big ole bowl of pasta! I am a pasta fanatic and whenever I can get a huge portion of pasta for a good price I go for it. The eastway location is only five minutes from my house in Oakhurst so it's perfect. It's located in a strip mall, casual, laid back place, and I find a lot of gems of restaurants in strip malls! I got the baked ziti with a salad and bread and I ate my entire huge plate of pasta. The salad and bread were yummy too! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good but one visit will do. There are better options for Italian cuisine in Charlotte. The pizza is also so so, there is definitely better examples of NY style pizza around."}
{"text":"I called in a supreme pizza and they said 15 minutes. I picked it up. I opened it at home. The pizza was soft, doughy, and basically inedible. I called to let them know they might want to adjust their cook times and he said \"so what do you want\".I thought I was being helpful or they would care about customer service. I've defended them for years and will always love their house dressing but their pizzas to go are bad and whoever is managing should know how bad their customer service is. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love they're food, but the two guys behind the counter never smile even when you speak to them.  They look like and act like they work for the Mafia.  The wait staff also seem to be tense, which is understandable working for those guys.  If you want great, fresh Italian food, you'll love it, just don't expect great customer service."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out a new pizza place, but it makes it hard when I have Villa Francesca and Hawthorne's close by.  My friend told me about Portofino's, telling me it was his favorite spot for a NY style pie.  I gave them a call last Saturday night when we felt like staying in for the night.

Don't be disturbed by the shopping center it's located in.  It's one grungy, depressing area.  I already knew that ahead of time, so it didn't bother me.  There were a few guys behind the counter, but the bald guy with the heavy Italian accent was funny as hell.  He asked me about my day and if I had any plans for the 4th of July holiday.  I told him about my plans and he wished me well and to be safe.  I didn't really expect such a nice, warm greeting.  That's customer service!

The pizza was great too.  A perfect NY style pie.  I was just in NYC last month, so I've got street cred!  There's a reason this place has 4.5 stars.  I think this might be my favorite pizza in CLT now, but I need to try it out a few more times before I go that far.  I'm pretty sure I'll be bumping it up to 5 stars in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"Far and away my favorite pizza.  They also have tasty pasta dishes, and I feel pretty confident the other food they serve is good.  My husband is passionate about good tomato sauce and Portofino's does it right.  The location does not indicate the deliciousness you are about to encounter, but the inside is cozy enough."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem among a neighborhood where that is rare. The service is excellent and the food is superb. It is always a welcome surprise to me to find the same standard here as in any other Portofinos in Charlotte. The specials always pique my curiosity and I've never been disappointed by one. The portions are generous and the ingredients  fresh and flavorful. I could survive on the bread alone but the salad could use an update. I'd eat here more often but my waistline couldn't take it!"}
{"text":"Incredible house salad dressing and what may be the best spaghetti with meat sauce I've ever had.  

This restaurant has several locations in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I came here for lunch. I've been to the one on Park Road and this place offers the subtle, homey feel that the other location did not. We had 25+ people with us and the restaurant was packed (always a good sign of delicious food). The staff was very accommodating and patient.

It was a Friday and I could not eat meat because of Lent. The waiter suggested the \"Mediteraneo,\" which is mixed seafood pasta in a creamy pink sauce. There is a selection of pasta types to choose from including Cappellini, Linguini, Fettuccini, Penne, or Spaghetti Noddles. I chose penne. This was HANDS DOWN, the most amazing pasta dish I have ever had! I am so sorry if you are not a seafood fan, but I'm sure this dish could sway you. I COULD NOT STOP EATING!! The waiter consistently asked how I liked my dish (since he recommended it), which was incredibly sweet. Overall: great food, great setting and great service!

As we left, I saw that they had Tiramasu on display (my all-time favoritteeee dessert!) so I HAVE to come back and try that! The Mediteraneo dish convinced me that everything else on the menu must be just as amazing! =)"}
{"text":"I first came to Charlotte and knew my NY Pizza life had ended. But I was pleasantly surprised that Portofinos knew good pizza. I told them when I walked in that I would be honest if it sucked. I was honest and it was fantastic. I have never been let down. We get a pie for lunch and and eat in the car. Just cause its fun. The arrabiate is great too. I have seen them grow from one store spreading throughout Charlotte.  Its worth trying. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I generally don't hang out on Eastway Drive, but over the years, I have been to this location many times for lunch and I'm a fan!   I really prefer this location of Portofino's over the other locations.  

For me, the food is much better here and so is the service. The first time I went here, I was picking up some pizzas to take back to the office.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of Italian-Americans whipping up some crazy good pizzas.  The smell of the place told me that I was gonna love the pizza, and I did! 

So, my next visit was for a lunch meeting. We had a great waitress who kept our glasses filled and brought plenty of bread while we were waiting for our entrees.  

On my first dine-in visit, I had one of their specials -  it was chicken lasagne with a white sauce.  Man, was it good!  The portion was huge, so I  had a nice second meal!  

Everything I have eaten at this location has been absolutely fabulous and there is no pretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! Tony (the chef) and the whole experience was A+! This was me and my fiancé's first time at this restaurant. We sit outside where in addition to our waitress greeting us, Tony introduced himself, let us know the specials, and offered us a 2 dish entree to split due to the size of the portions. The food was incredible! As we paid our tab and left taking our dessert, Tony again came out to tell us he appreciated our business and looks forward to us coming back. They offer catering as well. The best part was Tony and I saying chow to one another and then him turning to my fiancé (Susan) and uttering something in Italian that I'm sure was have a good evening ma'am - all my fiancé heard was Tony speaking Italian and melting in her seat!!! ! Thanks Tony and Portofino's Gastonia! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I love Portofino's from the bottom of my big, last name ends in a vowel that's not an E, partially Italian heart. Their pizza, it is perfect. Not too doughy, not too much sauce, no weird flavors, not to greasy. Just delicious.

I hadn't tried their other dishes until yesterday though, and if the pasta puttanesca and pasta with garlic and broccoli are any indication I need to start working my way through their menu pants size by pants size.

This location may not be in the most inviting shopping center but it is close to my home and my office and I generally pick up my food to go so really I'm not worried (besides, the police are a few doors down in the same strip mall).

Portofino's straight up delivers the outstanding quality I demand if I'm going out for Italian and I thank it for doing so."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte for NY style pizza. I'm from NJ so every time I eat here I feel like I'm home. The crust and sauce are delicious and perfect. They have reasonably priced slices and the entrees are a bit overpriced but delicious. The chicken parm is nothing short of fantastic. I always order a large salad so I can get some of the bread and dip it in the house dressing, which is also great. They have a great variety of pizza slices available unlike many of the areas pizza places that usually only have plain and pepperoni on hand and everything else has to be made to order.
Try the white pizza. They make it very well here!"}
{"text":"Somebody recommended Portifinos pizza to me. Well I decided to try it but I didn't get pizza I got a meatball sub ($9.65 way too much) and it was awful the meatballs were so nasty.  I will try Portifinos again but this time I will try the pizza like I was supposed to."}
{"text":"Got there about a hour before closing time, still welcomed us as if we were there first customer of the day with excitement. Got the bruschetta, fried calamari, and shrimp scampi!! I was hungry so the shrimp scampi was on point. Fried calamari was ok I had better. Bruschetta my g/f ate that and she liked it. Def try em out tho!!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. I've been going here since I was a kid and it's still a favorite. Eggplant parm and lasagna are always a good way to go. The pizza is fantastic too! Their marinara sauce is some of the best I've ever had so make sure ya ask for extra on the side to dip all of your carbs in. Staff is always very friendly and super knowledgeable about their product/ specials. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Fast, friendly and funny staff. We love Portofino's on Eastway!"}
{"text":"Found this place in yelp! 4 stars so I thought it would be a winner. Ordered two takeout pizzas, pepperoni and white with broccoli. A little doughie for my taste, and not enough broccoli or garlic flavor on the white one. Would have given two stars originally but we had the left overs for lunch and it crisped up in the oven  and was better the second time around."}
{"text":"My wife and I both grew up in Charlotte, but she had never tried Portofino's as her world revolved around south Charlotte before we got married while I first discovered Portofino's while commuting to UNCC and later moving to the UNCC area.

I told my wife for 2 years she needed to try out Portofino's and once I got her to go...she suggested we go back again within a week saying some of the best Italian food she's ever had.  I think perhaps the best eggplant parm in town.

Portofino's is really a hidden gem where every friend I've taken turns into an instant fan.  The food is every bit as good as Maggiano's over at South Park and better than the lesser competition like Carrabba's or Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Portofino's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It's affordable, fresh, tasty food with great service from accommodating staff. I used to only order chicken alfredo which isn't even on the menu at Portofino's and the kitchen was always very kind to make it for me anyway. BEST ALFREDO SAUCE IN CHARLOTTE! Now I tend to order off the menu (garlic and broccoli with penne all day!!!) and eat on the leftover for at least two more meals.

I largely wanted to write this review in response to previously mentioned safety concerns for the area. I may be a bit biased because I grew up in this neighborhood and still visit it frequently, but I'm not sure where the fear comes from...I mean, this parking lot is shared with a police station... 
I'm a petite female in my twenties and I have never once felt unsafe or threatened here or across the street where the Ross is and I have visited that Food Lion on more than one occasion late at night. 
Please do not let your suspicions about the safety of the neighborhood keep you from this gem! I am always afraid that I will lose my favorite Italian Restaurant because they can't stay afloat on that side of town.
Give them a try!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I REALLY like Portofino's. This is a family owned chain in Charlotte, with locations peppered around the city. This specific review is for the Eastway location only.
Their food is spot-on every time. It is great for take-out and for dine-in. If you dine at the restaurant, be sure to check out their specials. Last month I was lucky to catch their fra diablo lobster special, while my husband got the osso bucco with gnocchi. Both were very good, but the lobster won the prize!
On rainy days make sure to check out their pasta menu. The Mediterraneo with fettucine is always a winner."}
{"text":"Love this place!   There are several Portofino's around town.  Food is always really good!"}
{"text":"This place has some epic philly cheese steaks. The pizza is our second favorite in the area but we still stop by here on pizza night for their killer phillys!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town- hands down.  Found this place in Thrillist-I drive by 4 other pizza places that are on the list for Charlotte just to go to Portifino's.  Best in town!"}
{"text":"Real ingredients and very good pizza. Ingredients added and baked per order, even by the slice. So far the best pizza in Charlotte IMO and I must mention that the slices are large and inexpensive costing less than $7 for two. YuMmz"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about this place based on its location in a generally depressing part of town, however I've eaten here twice now and have been taught a lesson about judging a restaurant by its strip mall. 

The owners and managers are an authentic Italian family, and it shows. I like to hear them talk from the kitchen but the noise level in the restaurant is comfortable and makes for easy conversation. I'm a sucker for pasta so the first time I went I ordered the manicotti--it was great but not too exciting (though how exciting can manicotti be, really?), but I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. The next time I had the tortellini alfredo and it was HEAVENLY--the sauce was perfectly creamy, the ham and onions fresh, and the pasta cooked perfectly. And the portion was HUGE! My partner got a large calzone and said it was also great but there was way too much of it, which is always a great complaint about a restaurant, if you ask me. Their dishes are fairly priced and possibly even a little underpriced considering the portions...bring your appetite!

The restaurant itself is small and a little dim, but seems clean enough. The service on my first visit was great, our server was very helpful and patient even though they were about a half hour from closing time. On my second visit we had a different server whom I suspect may have been new to the job, he was a little over-attendant and could never hear what we were saying, even though the restaurant was near-empty and quiet. He was nice, though, and they are very accommodating if you want to change something on the menu or have a specific request. 

I would definitely recommend Portofino's to anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine, and I'm always looking forward to going back myself.

PS: Every time I visit, I feel like I'm in an episode of The Sopranos. And that is a compliment."}
{"text":"This place has me coming back again and again. I love so many items on the menu from the boscaiola, lasagne, meatballs, pizza, clams and linguini, but you cant beat their house salad dressing and fresh warm bread. Im a repeat customer at each of the three locations and and never been disappointed. Perhaps the most standout feature of Portafino's is the service. I feel like a family member when I'm picking up takeout. These guys run a serious takeout business and it seems to me that every customer is a regular. Dining in feels like a small Italian restaurant in NYC. So glad to be able to depend on Portafino's time and time again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite resteraunts in Charlotte. If you like Italian food you'll love Portofino!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in charlotte!  homemade pizza sauce,huge slices. The pasta dishes are portions definitely  worth the money,  every dish comes with salad and french baguette  loaf.. Authentic  Italian  restaurant  operated by Italians!9"}
{"text":"Perfect pizza!  Found this place on Yelp on the way out of the Charlotte Airport. It looked so good I actually turned around and back-tracked a few miles. So glad that I did!  Friendly staff and great food!  Real Italian food - from a guy who grew up in Jersey b"}
{"text":"After a long day of grad-school interviewing, I needed some comfortable Italian food, and Portofino's provided. The bread was always warm and really good. I loved the house sun-dried tomato basil salad dressing--it was so delicious, it almost tasted like a stand alone pasta sauce. I got penne pasta with their primavera sauce and it was so freaking good. Creamy, cheesy, perfect medley of flavors. The boyfriend got a cheesy red sauce concoction and really enjoyed it. We both had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day--win! Our server was AWESOME (wish I remembered her name, she deserves a shout-out). The pours of house wine were generous. I was super pleased with everything about this place, and would enjoy bringing guests of any kind back."}
{"text":"I've gone once and really enjoyed their eggplant Parma dish. I had enough for two days it was a huge dish really yummy! There was not a heavy fried batter it was a egg batter and you could actually taste the eggplant. I also had the wedding soup that was the special that day and it was really nice and fresh. You could tell it was homemade. I would definitely recommend you try it and I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!
Nice people that work there.
Not my favorite part of town wish you were somewhere near Cotswold shopping instead.
Chicken Parm is great!
Pizza delicious 
Cannoli not to bad could be a little more fresh."}
{"text":"They have great customer service. I've been there several times dine in and carry out. They always get the order correct and the food is fantastic! I highly recommend going there and giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Portofino's is your basic, non-pretentious red sauce restaurant. As long as you know that, you won't be disappointed. They do standard Italian dishes well (perhaps I should say Italian-American?). The veal marsala is great, as is the bolognese.
Having said all that, the Eastway location is the best one, IMHO. The (now closed) Gastonia one wasn't nearly as good, and I hear that the Park Road one isn't as good, either."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few times for 2 slices of pizza when in that area paying my Duke bill. The last time, the guy at the counter was typically unenthused & rudely abrupt in taking my order.  I understand that people may have a bad day here & there, and I will usually cut a business some slack, especially if I like the product. I never jump to conclusions. Still, the look in this guy's eyes this last time convinced me that though the pizza is good, I will no longer patronize this business that treats me like my presence is tolerated only for a quick & profitable transaction."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the Charlotte.  While there are numerous places to eat, not all are worth the money. We didn't have any expectations going in but beyond pleased leaving. We both had Chicken Parmesan. It was the best I've ever tatsed. We spent under 40 dollars and had lots of food to take home. The serving was a large one. The atmosphere was relaxing and the Sangria Wine was absolutely wonderful.  Our waiter was patient and very knowledgeable of the menu and specials. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Recent transplant from Philadelphia and I gotta say that they have the best pizza and cheesesteak in Charlotte, hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Their house salad dressing is the best! So is the antipasto with the meats and cheeses. They have a great menu, it's not too big or overwhelming with choices. I really like the whole wheat penne with garlic and broccoli. It's simple, but it's my favorite. My mom really enjoyed the lobster ravioli as well. We love this place as a regular Friday night dinner place."}
{"text":"I made an unplanned stop here because I'd heard good things about this place. I would say that it lived up to its reputation.  The food was very tasty and it arrived piping hot! Cheesecake was great!!  The servers were very friendly and accommodating. Overall, the place had a good vibe. I think it was a little pricey for what it was, and I would have liked a little better beer and wine selection. I am, however, already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This nice Italian restaurant is the perfect place for a cute date night with that special someone. The place is simple but the food is delightful. l love the Eggplant Parmesan it is absolutely delicious and enough to split with two people. Also if your looking to hang out after dinner this place is close to Plaza Midwood, Elizabeth and not far from Uptown!"}
{"text":"I tried portofino's for the first time on a Wednesday evening a couple weeks ago. This location is in a shopping center that's in a somewhat shady part of town (so I was definitely glad that we were in and out while it was still light out).

We were promptly seated and informed of the specials of the day. I had my mind set on ordering a sauvignon blanc but was told that they didn't have any so I settled for a glass of pinot grigio that very much tasted like a cheap glass of wine. I ordered the arriabbate which came with a side salad and Italian bread.

I decided to try the house salad dressing, which is tomato basil, and it was very good. Not too heavy but not too light either. The Italian bread was the true star. It was slightly warm and served with butter. Absolutely delicious and I even asked for a second bread basket #allthecarbsplease.

My main dish, the arriabbate, was just OK. I was expecting to taste more of the flavors but all I could taste were tomato and olives. The prosciutto that it's supposed to have was very inconspicuous to my taste buds. Our waiter was in training so he was very attentive to our needs.

Overall, I'd say it was good 'bang for your buck' meal and I'd be willing to try the other locations."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying... If you go to a restaurant that is known for its pizza, then order a salad, then it is YOU that deserves the low star rating. 

Best pizza in town that I know of. Best cheesesteaks in town hands down. Best garlic knots for sure. I've never had a Chicken Portofino anywhere else, but I can't imagine it would be better. 

Summary: phenomenal"}
{"text":"My son turned 21 and wanted pizza. Are you serious?!. We are not in Chicago buddy!

We sat in the driveway with all five kids for about 25 minutes while I searched on Yelp! for a decent pizza place. Criteria being good, not too fancy, or expensive.
We narrowed it down to this place and finally headed out with hungry monsters in tow.

What is up with restaurants in mall strips? It really give us pause as to whether to enter or not. Sorry. I'm not from around here so I'm still adjusting.

Well, we ventured with our ravenous pack and was seated immediately. Ordered our drinks and appetizers. Then two pan pizzas. I appreciated the quick and attentive service.

Loved the mozerally sticks. Bruschetta was missing something but decent.

As for the pan pizzas- delicious! Cheese tasted fresh. Sauce was flavorful and not overbearing. Crust was buttery and thick. Little monsters transformed into happy satisfied saints. We left full and happy.

Birthday dinner for my now adult child was a success.

Guess where we are ordering our pizzas when the Chicago Bears are playing?"}
{"text":"I don't mind when positive reviews lead me to a bad restaurant, because at least I get to write an honest review of how bad it really is! 

To start the restaurant could definitely use some cleaning, including the restrooms. The severs have no personalities and make the already dark and gloomy restaurant much more depressing. Little did I know the food would be even more depressing. 

Their prices aren't horrible and when you taste the food you'll understand why, they definitely aren't using quality ingredients. 

I ordered a simple and basic Chicken Parmigiana which they completely butchered! The Chicken had no breading and wasn't even hot enough to melt the supposed mozzarella cheese on top of it. They're very stingy with their pasta portions as well. 

The spaghetti with Italian sausage was also subpar and had no authentic flavors to it. We skipped the desserts because they didn't look very appealing spinning aground in the display carousel wrapped in saran wrap. 

How this place has so many positive reviews is beyond me. But if you don't want to waste your time and money, SKIP IT!"}
{"text":"First off, this whole review is based off To-Go, so I just wanted to note this.....

I grew up in New York and just moved to Charlotte from just outside New York City....basically Italian Central!  I have ate a ton of great Italian food and am Italian myself.

When I walked into Portofino, I felt like I was back in Westchester!  Slices on the counter, garlic knots....all of the good stuff.

I have not had the pizza, but have tried a few dinners.  The stuffed shells were awesome, and included a huge portion!  The chicken Parm was great, and again huge portion.  All meals are served with a salad (delicous homemade \"house\" dressing and a full small loaf of freshly baked bread.

This place is in a somewhat sketch plaza on Eastway.....it's kinda weird that it's there, but that doesn't really matter!  It is my new \"Go to\" Italian spot when I want a taste of home."}
{"text":"Upon arriving I learned that this restaurant is closed for two days due to \"Technical Issues\". I made a reservation just yesterday; was NOT informed.  Furious."}
{"text":"I had a huge, insurmountable craving for a salad slathered in Italian dressing last night. I was alone, so I did something kind of shameful...I set out to find the Olive Garden that was tucked away off of Independence Blvd. I found it, but much to my salad-craving chagrin, it was closed. Closed, gone the way of other Independence Blvd. businesses. So no unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks for me. 

I started thinking of where I might find some affordable, but good Italian food, and I remembered Portofino's. It's not in the nicest shopping center ever, but the food is really good, and the prices are very reasonable. For $13 or so, I got stuffed shells, a soda, crusty bread, and a delicious, delightful salad. I was pleased.

The servers were friendly, and the service was quick. There was no line to wait, either, even on a busy Saturday night...so it's a far better option than some of the \"fancier\" Italian restaurants. Yes, this shopping center is kind of creepy, but Portofino's is worth it."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte I would always go with the usual pizza places (Pizza Hut, Domino's) when it was pizza night. I eventually got tired of the same pizza and I decided to research the area. I looked at a number of different Italian restaurants and pizza places before stumbling over Portofino's. I decided to give them a try and I have not had any regrets since then. The pizza is excellent. The crust is crispy on the bottom and not soggy at all. The balance between toppings, cheese, and sauce is perfect. Too much of one can disrupt the balance and you end up with soggy pizza. They have a number of other dishes that are exceptional. The manicotti alla vodka is like no other. The sauce is excellent and not too meaty. I would recommend it to anyone looking for quality Italian food and/or pizza. They offer a carryout menu, which is convenient when life is too busy for you to sit down for a meal. So far Portofino's is the best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza. The pizza was soggy and bland. No quality here.....and the place is a dump.  If you have the option to go to Hawthornes do it. I'd even settle for house of pizza"}
{"text":"Unreal how disrespectful the owner is. He talks down to everyone. I used to love the pizza but now it's not as good. And forget about the oil pockets he calls garlic knots. Absolutely disgusting. Oil seeped out of the bag and there was oil all over my car seat. I was so pissed. 

I can't believe he sold me this food and took my money. He should have paid me to eat this crap. I threw it away. I took a bite of the garlic knot and oil filled my mouth. I literally gagged. He makes racist comments. And always seems so upset with everyone who walks in. He has a \"I'm better than you simple Americans type feel\". I don't know who you \"think\" you are but you need to take a course in customer service. 

They need to shut this place down like they did the old Walmart. Same raggedy shopping center. Been going for years on and off. But I'm no longer going back ever again. But who cares right? I'm only one person. What do I matter. 

I used to love their pizza but he doesn't take pride in his business or food like he used to. Not sure maybe he has become jaded/bored from the monotony of running the counter all these years or maybe his customers are just not good enough for him but whatever. Sell your business and stay your ass home then. Thanks in advance. 

Btw I was complaining about my horrible experience to my cousin earlier tonight. And she said he is so racist and she stop going there after he told her to go back to Africa. Which I still can't believe. My mouth just dropped to the floor. 

But after reading the other reviews, I just realized this is his normal attitude. I'm glad he didn't say that to me though lol. I would have read him to filth, then proceeded to call whistle blower 9 and then called the health dept on his ass daily, like it was my business. 

Not sure if you read your reviews(highly doubt it) but if you do...Small man complex is really real! Zero out of 5 stars for you little man. If I could give you a (-5) I would. That's how disgusted I am with the owner and this place of business."}
{"text":"STELLAR CHEESESTEAKS, that are almost too pretty to eat. They feature soft, plentiful steak, onions, peppers, and mushrooms, topped by a generous amount of melted provolone. Even the bread is perfect, soft on the inside with a great crust. The sandwich is HUGE. This is still the best cheesesteak that I've eaten in the Queen City, and maybe anywhere.

Portofino's has great pasta and I love their multiple veal dishes. 

Their house salad is loaded with green olives, strong on the vinegar, and definitely an acquired taste. I will admit that I have grown to love their salads, even though they're simplistic. 

Professional service by waiters who are serious about their job. Every time that I've eaten here the service has been simply first class in all respects. 

The desserts are beautifully made and delicious. 

Linen on the tables and silverware, instead of cheapo plastic utensils. 

Area code size parking."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Ordered a cheesesteak and asked for chips, specifically. The manager behind the register acted like he didn't hear or UNDERSTAND me and asked if I wanted some fries in response. I said \"ok\" bc I wanted SOMETHING to eat with my cheesesteak.
So 2 to go orders went ahead of mine and I seen inside the bag...both bags of FREE chips that COME WITH ...the cheesesteak already. 
So I said ok no problem he got me. But then I asked for some ranch for my fries (I like ranch and ketchup) on my fries. He goes, \"ranch is $1\"

Hey keep your ranch!! And your shizty service"}
{"text":"I ordered the popular shrimp scampi and mozzarella sticks.  The main dish cake with soup or salad and Italian bread.  I chose a soup and the soup of the day was lentil.  I didn't care for the soup much but saved it for my lunch for the following day and it was a meal itself.  The shrimp scampi was light tasting.  I had hoped for it to be highly seasoned but that's our homemade version so the fact that it was based with lemon and butter told me it would be light.  It tasted better the next day.  This location was prettier inside with the arches and lighting than the one I usually visit."}
{"text":"I have an unnatural love for the white pizza with broccoli.  Nothing fancy, but just the right combo of salty and greasy and comforting.  I've had the capresi salad as well when the tomatoes are in season and it is just what you'd expect.  They may also have other good stuff, but frankly I always order the white pizza with broccoli.

I do look at the desserts most trips and have had several that are excellent.  Over the years I've done their cheesecake regularly, which is a good sized slice of very respectable cheesecake with a raspberry drizzle.  I've also done their carrot cake, which I like a little less.  The frosting is less cream cheesy than I'd like.  They also often have special desserts and those are hit or miss.  Most recently had one that was two layers of a homey white cake with a lemon creme in between and it was fabulous.    Wouldn't mind if they had that one as a standard offering, although I'd probably have to buy larger pants.  

We tend to take out, as it's in a sketchy shopping center and can get a significant number of beggars/loiterers over the years--east end has character:)  Shopping center may be looking up, however, as a QT has been built as a new anchor.  If you want more typical ambiance, go to the Park Rd. location, but expect a wait.  Overall, a very solid little restaurant for unpretentious Italian food and some surprisingly good desserts."}
{"text":"I used to work in this area so on my lunch break I would eat here a lot this place had been here for years and the food is really good from the pizza to the ravioli to the Gorgonzola chicken try it all!!!"}
{"text":"Just went here for a date night, and will definitely be coming back when we are in the mood for Italian. 

Food: Really reasonable prices for the huge portions of food. The quality of the pasta, tastiness of the sauces, ceasar salad fixings, and homemade bread were all amazing. Shrimp Parmesan gets two thumbs up. Split an appetizer, salad, bread, and entree and took home a full meal for leftovers. 

Wine: Selection was okay. Mostly 6/glass and 24/bottle, all Italian. The reds we got were tasty.

Atmosphere: NY stlye pizza counter when you first walk in, then it becomes a quaintly decorated Italian themed place, lighted well and romantic.

Service: Exceptional!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Portofino's. I had the pleasure of trying the Salmon and Mussel Pasta. It is a big serving as I expected from the photos of previous reviewers. The food tasted amazing and it also came with free bread and your choice of either a salad or soup. I went with the salad and house sun dried tomato-basil dressing. My plate looked so appetizing that I forgot to take a photo and devour it all haha."}
{"text":"Me and my friend wanted to change up our italian place we went to see Wicked and went to Portofinos.  Very good food, I had the Chicken Tarantino and Fried Calamari, both were excellent and quite a bargain for the price.  The salad was a little small and they didn't have the great breadsticks like Olive Garden but I suppose that's why Olive Garden is my favorite.  Still excellent food and would definitely go back!  Has an Amalfi's of Statesville feel but in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Wow. WOW. WoW! wOw! w0w! WOWZERZ! woooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Any way you say it, Wow is the first word that comes to mind with this place. Sure, the parking lot always said \"MUG ME\", but after my dinner tonight at Portofino's on Eastway, I'll never look at this shopping center the same.

Came in around 6:30 on Saturday and this place was jumpin! Lots of couples, and a few families, we were seated immediately and started off with the Capri - buff.mozz, tomatoes, basil, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and oil/vin/spices. Everything was great, the portion was definitely big enough to split between 4 (there were only 2 of us), and the homemade bread that came out with it.... ohhhh madre, it was excellent. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. 

I chose to go with the Mediterrano (w/ the pink sauce and Capelinni) due to the other reviews about it and whoa - 5 stars! Light, flavorful and multi-leveled, the pink sauce was just as good as my Nana's and I've never been able to compare her to anyone! My date went with the Scilian pizza with sausage and onions. $14.00 for the biggest pizza I have seen in recent memory. He loved it, and we've got the left overs so I'm excited to try it tomorrow (I was too busy making \"MMMM\" sounds to my pasta to try his pizza).

The grand finale left me speechless: THE CANOLI. We ordered 1 each and I swear I could have eaten 15. Filled completely through, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cocao, this canoli was a gift from the gods. I can't remember the last time I had a canoli this good was, and it makes me want to never try anywhere else's canolis because this was just the tip top of the mountain and nothing else is going to ever compare. I'm serious. I'M SERIOUS FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY - this canoli was just amazing.

Service was great, speedy and kind. Parking is easy, abeit a little rough looking. Portofino's, I love you and I love you even more since you're a few blocks from my home. If I ever sell, I will be sure to note you in my ads as a \"plus\" to homeownership around here! :)"}
{"text":"Very nice! It's been at least 10 years since I've been to Portofinos. Don't know why I waited so long to return. Maybe because it's located in a not so desirable part of town. This side of town has been trying to \"revitalize\" for years but I guess not enough gentrification has occurred. Anyhoo (yes, anyhoo), after attending an event at nearby Ovens Auditorium, our group of 5 went here for dinner. It was close to 8:30 pm upon our arrival and the restaurant closes at 10. Nevertheless, we were greeted with a smile and attended to promptly. Three of us ordered the special \"lobster ravioli\" and it was amazing! Huge portions and a yummy sweet sauce. Sorry, I didn't take a picture. Another ordered the lasagna and she really enjoyed it. Everyone took home doggie bags because the portions were so huge. Our server was great. Prompt, attentive, polite. The prices were very reasonable. Oh yeah the bread! So good! Hot and soft! Butter just melted right on it. Will definitely need to come to this side of town again. Glad that Portofinos decided to stay and support this community."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner after seeing Celtic Women. Food was amazing. Service was very lacking to down right rude. 

We were having a girls night out and the restaurant was NOT busy. After dinner, I inquired about spumoni. Was told they didn't have it at this restaurant, we waited to find out what desserts they did have....the waiter stared at us...then left. Totally confused now, we asked the bus boy for the check. Had to ask the bus boy to get us change.

My friend held the tip under her hands while we chatted to see if our waiter would return. Sure enough, about ten min. later, he came by and asked for his tip. Lol..totally bizarre."}
{"text":"I admit, I have lived reasonably close to Portofino's for almost 2 years and never once even seriously considered driving here.  Why, you may ask?  I have been told by many a person that you can't get decent, reasonably-priced Italian food here.  However, I can't imagine that the people who told me this had ever sat foot inside this little slice of paradise.

This place is flippin' awesome!  I rarely ever order or eat marinara sauce at restaurants; however, Portofino's has some of the best marinara I've ever eaten in my life.  It is such a perfect balance of flavors paired with high quality ingredients, without the need of complicated flavors to mask low-quality ingredients.  It's not too sweet, not too salty, and has a great tomato flavor.  On the first trip, I ordered the Chicken Sorrento, which included a large chicken breast.  Not only did the food taste fresh and flavorful, the portions were definitely big enough for dinner and plenty of leftovers for the next day.  My partner ordered the Tortellini Alfredo, which was very rich and satisfying.  For dessert, we ordered the cannoli and the tiramisu.  The filling in the cannoli was very rich and sweet, yet the shell was still crisp and not soggy.  The tiramisu was magical - the best I've ever had.  The marscapone was very smooth-tasting and the coffee flavor was not overpowering.  On the second visit, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  Again, I loved the sauce, but the crust was a little too thin in places to hold up to the toppings.  I will definitely say they do NOT skimp on the toppings and cheese, which was super.  The sauce and crust were wonderful otherwise, and this is a pretty solid place to get pizza.  We also ordered the garlic knots, which were drizzled with buttery-oil mixture and garlic.  They were a little too small to adequately absorb all the flavors, but they were decent.

As for service and decor, this place is amazing.  Our waitress was so helpful and sweet to us, I just adored her.  While the plaza that houses this restaurant looks slightly (or moderately) questionable, this place is very open and nice-looking on the inside.  I loved the decor, with comfortable tables and an open look inside.  

I am sad I did not try this place sooner, but now that I know it's there, I have a bad feeling I'll be going there too often.  I may possibly dream of their marinara sauce tonight."}
{"text":"After a long road trip, I was interested in trying out a unique or \"buzzworthy\" local restaurant as a first-time Charlotte visitor.  When my host pulled up to Portofinos in a non-descript strip mall, I was a little disappointed.  Italian restaurants from my hometown of Indy mostly offer bland-tasting, Americanized muck, so I was immediately biased against Portofinos. 

However, I was pleasantly surprised by Portofinos...décor, food, service, and all. Our table split both a bottle of dry spicy Malbec and the delicious Hot Antipasto sampler (clams, mussels, stuffed mushrooms & eggplants, and shrimp).  In an attempt to avoid a too-rich meal, I ordered the caprese salad and a cup of Italian wedding soup for dinner. While the mozzarella didn't meet my ideal (i.e. buffalo-milk-based bits of heaven), the salad was fresh-tasting and hit the spot. I also tasted my dining mates' salmon salad, baked ziti, and shrimp scampi. All were good, but the grilled salmon salad really stood out.  It came with a diverse assortment of marinated vegetables (artichokes, mushrooms, red pepper, etc) that really elevated the salad beyond just plain ole lettuce & fish.

I regret not getting to try out Portofinos' pizza, as I was repeatedly told how delicious it was.  You can watch the pizzas being made through a glass partition, which was a nice touch. Next time, no more negative Italian food bias ...and anchovy pizza, you will be mine!"}
{"text":"I'm really floored by all of the amazing reviews of this place. I've been twice and both times were disappointing. One time I got the pizza there, it was very heavy, greasy and doughy in the middle. It was disgusting but I was starving so I choked my way through a couple of slices and later got very ill!

The next time I went was not by choice, I was meeting a large group there for lunch. The waiter obviously knew he would get automatic gratuity due to the size of our party and gave us dinner menus instead of lunch menus to beef up the bill total. He was also very sneaky about additional charges (\"would you like fries, chips or salad with that?\" -- failing to mention the fries and salad were additional charges). I requested a lunch menu and ordered the chicken parm sandwich, it was ok -- but nothing special.

I will say they have very large portions but otherwise it's not very noteworthy."}
{"text":"Will never ever return to this location again. I've been coming to Portofino's for over 10 years. Never been so disappointed. I always get shrimp Fra Diavolo with a mix of marinara and Alfredo. First time ever (actually second, same rude waiter different location) the waiter insisted that I had to get a side of Alfredo and be charged 3.25. Ok fine. So then my salad got an extra dressing $1, croutons $1, cheese $1. When the bill came it showed 55.60. I added it up four times came to 52.60 waiter said its because they didn't have the buttons to add the dressing, cheese and croutons. So why are they charging me for it. I'll never come back here, long long time customer lost. Food was good as usual. Had this same issue with this waiter before the other waiter said don't worry it's his last day. Just to realize he only moved to another location."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to go for Italian to dine in and for the carry out service. The food is always incredible and the staff has to be some of the friendliest in Charlotte. I will always order from this place and time and time again. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Went once for lunch. We had pizza, on a recommendation that it was the \" best pie in town \" . If it is in fact the best in town I would only make pizza at home. It was mediocre at best. Crust was just how I like it from a texture point perfect balance between chewiness and crunchy ends but it was only slightly more flavorful than a big chain fast food pizza place. The cheese was ok and the sauce was simple and unremarkable taste . The 3 toppings we ordered were mushroom , black olives and banana peppers they were eye appealing on the pie but not particularly anything special. The place was fairly busy and I will try another item off the menu another time and it better be better than the pizza . I thought the music in the restaurant as a bit odd it was a mix between the Sinatra channel and Mexican radio and was too loud for a lunchtime. I can't say that effected my review but it certainly didn't help it."}
{"text":"I first tried this Portofino's years ago and am glad they now have multiple locations and have upgraded their decor but this is the location i still keep coming back to.

The pizza alone is one of the best Italian Pie's in Charlotte...good sauce, good dough and lots of toppings.  No skimping here.

The other things worthwhile here are the lasagna and the pastas with gorganzola sauce.  Also their house salad dressing is great...a tomato based creamy Italian which also doubles as a great dipping for the hot and fresh bread delivered to your table.

Service is always spot on at this location as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I (along with two of our closest friends in Charlotte) went to Portofinos on Christmas Eve, for the very first time. We were craving Italian food, but didn't want a chain restaurant vibe and found ourselves here. 

The dining area was nice and seemed inviting. Similar to the more authentic Italian places in the Washington, D.C. Area (where I'm from) the servers were a bit older, which was cool. Our server and food runners were very helpful an attentive, and gave excellent entree recommendations. The dining crowd that night consisted of mostly families and it was a lively bunch. 

The meal came with salad and bread. Both of which were fine. My entree (chicken Portofino) first of all was pretty huge and excellent!  I usually finish my entrees in restaurants, but I had to take it home. It was delicious that night and pretty darn delicious for lunch the next day too. The rest of our party enjoyed their meals as well. 

We also found the meal to be very reasonable. Not pricey at all. So oversll, the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. I cannot wait to take my parents there when they visit. In fact, I can't wait that long, I'll be back there very soon! :)"}
{"text":"How oh how have I not reviewed Portofino's yet?

We have been going here for years. It is a great, local Italian restaurant. The pizza is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (the quottro is our favorite). All of their pizza is delicious. The seafood pizza is surprisingly good. I honestly think this is probably the best pizza in Charlotte.

Go sometime for the other dishes- everything is good. Don't get sucked into thinking it is just pizza.

The owners/staff are warm, hilarious, hospitable and genuinely get to know you. We have had a good/ongoing rapport with most of the staff for years now. They treat us very well. If you become a regular- they will treat you like family. 

The house salad is really, really good. The dressing is homemade. DIP YOUR CRUST IN THE DRESSING. 

My only complaint? They don't deliver"}
{"text":"I think the people here (at least at the takeout counter) are much nicer & more welcoming that the one on Park Rd.

I got the Antipasti Salad to go.

I love that salad.  A decent amount of lettuce, but tons of delicious Italian meats, cheeses & olives, together & topping the lettuce.  A great house dressing, kind of like Thousand Island, but less tangy... I loved it.

The man behind the counter was a talker, but he kept everything in order & seemed to know everyone that walked in.

Another nice place in the Eastland area!"}
{"text":"Valentines dinner.  The waitress did not bring my salad prior to entre ..no big deal.  The new back waiter spilled my childs tea on the plate and table. No big deal my child was in the restroom.  Problem when I asked the server to please comp the salad she was like well its included.  I said thats fine could you please comp my teas then.  I also explained the back waiter never mopped up the spilled tea that was all over one side of the table.  He just took the plate and cup and never wiped up the spilled tea.  I had to go to another table to get a chair to seat my child when he returned from the restroom because his side of the table was covered with tea.  So the waitress comes back and said she couldn't take off the teas because her boss gets really upset about that kind of thing once its already rung up. So my review is low and I will not go back.   Its a shame that I was so understanding and nothing was comp'ed."}
{"text":"Yum, yum and yummy. I had my carb overload from here and that is okay.  For a starter I ordered the calamari and it was delicious. It came with the usual marinara sauce and slice a lime.  What I could appreciate about the calamari was that it was not overly salted like most restaurants do. My meal that I ordered came with bread and salad.  You can tell the bread is fresh out of the oven and I enjoyed every bit of it. The salad was just like any other iceberg salad so nothing really special but I did love the house dressing.  As for my main dish the tortelini gorgonzola and it was nice an rich the way I like it.  

I am so lucky I don't live in the area. I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great prices. Professional staff and delicious food. I've been eating here for 10-plus years. Pizza to salads to pasta - it's all delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place in Charlotte is Portofino. They have several locations including in east Charlotte and in south Charlotte on Park Road. The Eastway location is nostalgic for me as I went there on occasion as a youngster. The bread is fabulous - served warm with real butter. I also really like the orange colored dressing that they serve with their salads and all of the pasta dishes are great, especially the seafood selections. If you're ever in the mood for Italian in Charlotte, you should definitely give this a try."}
{"text":"My fallback here is always the lasagna. Unbelievable and enough to feed me for three days. Get the house dressing for your salad. YUM. Hafta say their pizza didn't knock my socks off, so I'm sticking to the pasta dishes.
The cooks and staff are always accommodating and friendly. A good casual place to get your Italian fix."}
{"text":"Went there before going to the Oven Auditorium.  Large portions.  Good service.  Good food.  Need I say more."}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Their house salad dressing is so good, I have never had anything like it.  Their portion sizes are huge, enough to eat on for a few days.  They have a Gorgonzola Chicken, but they will switch it up and do shrimp instead.  I really like that they will customize how you want your entree."}
{"text":"I yelped this place before a concert at ovens auditorium. Its not far at all from the venue. We had a pizza with a few different toppings. The pizza was very good and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Goo!!!"}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's best kept secrets on Eastway?  Maybe so, I never would have ever went into this place if my cousin told me how great it was. I did not know that they were affiliated with the other Charlotte locations. I love how they have some of the best \"New York Style Pizza\" in Charlotte. Most places that claim they have the best have garbage in my opinion. 


The service is really great as well, our server would come by every few minutes to check on us and we would chat with him for a good bit too. Dining in makes me feel I am in a Romano's to some extent. The subs are good, I generally would get the meatball one."}
{"text":"This is THE best Italian food I've had in NC.

I've only been to the Eastway location, I've dined in and had take out, and it's always been fantastic.

You get a good Italian sized quantity with really great ingredients.
The server I had was really funny and understand that half our party accidentally went to the wrong location.

I love this place. It's a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Craving delicious Italian food, no bells, and on the cheap?  Portofino's on Eastway Drive is your ticket.

This is the ORIGINAL location in Charlotte, and far less crowded than the Park Rd. location.  And personally, I think the food is better.  

We began with an appetizer of roasted red peppers and sliced mozzarella.  There was lots of it, and it really hit the spot. All entrees come with a house salad.  I am in love with their house dressing.  It reminds me more of a creamy French meets Italian dressing.  For my entree, I ordered the the clams in a white sauce over linguine.  This is my go-to Italian dish.  It is overflowing with clam meat (or clam flesh? ew) and in a scrumptious white wine and butter sauce.  WAY too much for me to eat in one sitting.  Hello lunch for the next 2 days!

The wine prices are some of the cheapest I have ever seen.   I am fairly certain they only offer  wine and beer.  So pick your poison.  It is so good.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but still a nice place to have a cute little date w/ good food and drinks. I went during dinner and it was pretty chill, noise level was low.
I had the fried calamari, house salad, fresh bread/butter, and the chicken parm tonight... I have not one complaint about the food. Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious. The customer service was also very good. I usually don't indulge in the bread and butter that comes out before the entree but omfg, their bread comes out piping hot and fresh. I ate the whole damn roll w/ the butter.  And idk about anybody else but I can tell how good an Italian restaurant is by their fried calamari and Portofino's definitely passed!"}
{"text":"If you own a car and live in the 28205 zip code, there is NO reason to order delivery. Go pick up your pizza from Portofinos. It authentic...down to the genuine Italian guys running the joint...who will verify with you EVERY single time you call that you are calling the Eastway location. 

I get a large pepperoni, small cheese, garlic knots and cheesecake...and I drink a peroni when I go pick it up."}
{"text":"This had been one of our favorites for years, but lately the service has fallen off since they have been emphasizing take out. My wife and I stood at the hostess area for twenty minutes tonight without being acknowledged by any of the staff. The ones that had to retrieve menus or silverware from the station went out of their way not to make eye contact or talk to us, even when we asked them where the hostess was. Finally, after standing around long enough for other people to come in, order take out and get their food, I went to the waiter station that seemed to attract all the staff, I asked if the were going to seat us or were we going to have to eat somewhere else.  The blank look and \"ummm...\" Reply gave us the answer, and we went to Simonetti's."}
{"text":"Sad to do this, but it must be done...review update!!! The past two times I have been to this location, my food has been a terrible disappointment.  I get the same thing every single time.  How can it be messed up?! It's so simple...I don't get it.  Rigatoni with spicy marinara.  The last visit was the worst.  The sauce has been watery and bland with not a hint of spice.  It even looked lighter red than normal and was so thin.  I didn't even finish more than a few bites.  The time before that, I sent my food back and the waitress said \"you probably won't get a discount because the owner is cheap\"....ok, what?!  First off, I don't complain for a discount, second...if my meal sucks it sucks.  So this last time I made no mention of the depressing sauce because I didn't feel like dealing with it.  The bread was also doughy and gross....barely warm.  It was not even 1PM!!! 

I might have to continue my love for Italian at one of the other locations, which sucks because they are further away.  Big let down!! And money wasted."}
{"text":"Still top-of-the-line northern Italian. Fantastic, thin-crust pizza at very affordable prices. 9\" pies (which are truthfully more like 11\") start at $7.50 for plain cheese with additional toppings at half a buck each. Salads are cheap-ish and the house dressing (a unique creamy Italian) is subtle and satisfying. I've always had awesome service here as well-- and the pizza dude (owner?) slinging dough as you enter is a sweetheart.

There's also some interesting wines on their short list, ranging up to $60 a bottle."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the location of this Portofino's but overall it was a decent experience. Our waitress was very nice and the prices were reasonable. We had their pizza which was pretty good. However, had they used fresher ingredients for their toppings it would have been a lot better. All in all it was a nice last minute decision on a Friday night when we didn't have any reservations."}
{"text":"My guy put me onto Portofino's and now I wish there was one closer to where I live. I have have the Chicken Tarantino and the Chicken Portofino. The Tarantino keeps me coming back. It's a tomato based entree with plenty of garlic, sun dried tomatoes, and fresh parsley that leaves me wanting more. SO Delicious. The sauce and pasta alone are good enough that it'd make for a great vegetarian dish. I think that the chicken could stand to be soaked in seasoning at the open of business to have its own because it taste less than fresh to me. The chicken Portofino is also great, a cream based sauce with mushrooms and prosciutto. Also, wonderful and full of flavor. The service here is always nice and the dining room is full of life. While in a modest location, this restaurant is a top contender for authentic Italian in Charlotte. It has been here for years and there are a few locations around town. Nevertheless, you cannot beat the original."}
{"text":"This is our go to for Italian and we've had numerous dishes and pizza and I can honestly say we've never had a bad experience or meal. Some of the best pasta sauce around. Chicken Parmesan, lasagna and the baked ziti are some of our favorite dishes. Service is always top notch. I would highly recommend this place. There are a few other locations but we think the Eastway Drive location is the best for some reason."}
{"text":"Went to Portofino's this past Saturday as I had been craving pizza for a few days, specifically New York Style. I love the big floppy,hot melty, greasy goodness style of pizza.  I had been asking around and could not find any good NYS pizza, but a friend recommended Portifinos so I said why not? O M G So good! Brought me back up north, all this time I was searching and had settled on Librettos as the closest to what I want but low and behold Portifinos came to save the day. Only giving 4 stars because the customer service seemed a littled forced, not genuine and slightly cold."}
{"text":"Get the chicken parm with vodka sauce and thank me later! Simple restaurant, nothing fancy, but great traditional Italian food."}
{"text":"Excellent. Here's a rundown: 

Service: 10 (of 10)
Cleanliness: 9.5
Atmosphere: 9
Bread: 9.5 
Salad: 8
Chicken Parm: 9.8
Angel Hair Pasta: 9.7
Pizza: 9

Unless you have really bad timing and catch them on an off night, you should be happy about your decision to dine here."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times over the last 6 years. We even suggested our best friends have their wedding dinner here and everyone was so satisfied. The wait staff is very friendly and the food is fantastic !"}
{"text":"So happy we decided to eat here after reading the reviews. We went with the white pizza with spinach and the eggplant parmigiana. It did not disappoint! Both my boyfriend and I loved it. The service was great and prompt and the atmosphere was also good. The food portions where generous and they had a great wine selection. Definitely will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I'd give it 5 stars but the atmosphere holds it back. The food more than makes up for the lack of ambiance, however. I personally recommend the Linguini with white clam sauce. (If you're looking for a new pizza carry out and place, give them a whirl!)"}
{"text":"Finally we've found Italian that we like in this city!!  We live close to Portifino's, but have been putting off going there.  We had a pretty bad experience with Dolce, and had been told that good Italian is an impossibility in Charlotte.  I had a good feeling about this place when I walked in the door.  It smelled amazing, and had that perfect non pretentious atmosphere that a good Italian place should have.  I ended up ordering the Tortellini Alfredo, and my special lady friend had the Chicken Sorrento.  Both were amazing.  It made the other Italian I've had in Charlotte look like Chef Boyardee.  It was difficult, but somehow we managed to reign back and save a little room for dessert.  We had the Cannoli, and the Tiramisu.  The filling in the Cannoli almost brought a tear to my eye.  The Tiramisu was a huge portion, and was some of the best I've ever had.  All in all I plan on this place being our go to Italian, and I can't wait to go back and try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Pizza....this is the best of the best!  Fresh Bread, crisp wine and delicious Italian.  Always a favorite for my family...you cant go wrong at Portifino's."}
{"text":"The food was great. It had a lot of flavor, was hot when it came out, and came out in a reasonable time. My only complaint about the food was I had a slice of bruschetta and the bread was soggy. Starting out the server was great, he was on top of filling our drinks and answering our questions. Then he hot a large group and he completely ignored us after this, not he was slow to come around, he didn't come back. I had to ask a bus boy to bring our check, and when the check was brought, it was brought by a different server. OK, that's not cool. This would have been a 5 star review but the lack of interest really turned my group off to the place. Especially since it was a Sunday evening when they weren't busy, except for that one big group. Not sure if we'll return"}
{"text":"It's OK, but used to be a lot better.  Service and food quality have slipped as of late and there has been a lot of waitstaff turnover.  Really hoping things turn around, as I used to dine here twice a week and I have stopped altogether after several bad experiences.  

The good:

*Great service (at least in the past)
*Large portions, usually enough to take home
*Wide variety of menu choices - something for everyone 
*Almost every meal comes with warm bread and salad - so you don't get \"nickle and dimed\"
*Shrimp scampi is surprisingly good - would not have expected it to be good
*Decent wine at reasonable prices

The bad:

*Service at Eastway location has deteriorated - lots of waitstaff turnover - food coming out cold - orders not correct - long wait to get check - appetizers forgotten
*Specials can be hit or miss - the ossa bucco is not worth trying -- stick with pasta, pizza and entrees they sell a lot of

I wish I knew who owned it - this is a great place that is slipping and it could easily be fixed if someone realized it and took action."}
{"text":"One of the best pasta and pizza shops in town!!! They have 3 locations and they should have more!!! Chicken Portofino is excellent, they have a creamy pink sauce called bosciola which comes prepared with your choice of pasta, salads are always fresh and the house dressing is to die for it's some sort of creamy italian infused with hints of basil!!

True NY style pizza prob one of the best spots in Charlotte! We have been going here for over 10 years!!! I'm a true foodie wouldn't steer ya wrong!"}
{"text":"This is the place for authentic Italian the staff is attentive and the food is awesome tucked away in a strip mall you could miss it ,but be sure you don't You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have had Portofino's carry out many many times over the year we've lived in the area. An unhealthy amount, probably, but we just love this place. Even with carry out the experience is pleasant, quick, and the food is still hot and fresh when you get home. A few weeks ago we actually went into the Park Road location and fell in love with it. It's a sweet ambiance with great staff and reminds me of eating in NJ/NY with my large Italian family. This is the only place I 100% love the sauce other than the kitchens of my mother, grandmother, and aunt. I am very picky about Italian food and Portofino's has my heart as the best Italian spot in Charlotte. I get the eggplant parmigiana nearly every time, my obsession, and my boyfriend always tries something new. Perfect every time, with plentiful portions so you won't leave hungry. Oh and don't forget to get a strong, tasty cocktail with dinner!"}
{"text":"The one in the south in Ayrsely is way better. I expected similar food and ambience, was let down. Appetizer was good, main course pizza was not. Wouldn't come back to this location for sure."}
{"text":"I haven't tasted anything from here that I haven't loved! Truly reminds me of the Italian food I grew up with in upstate NY. Dine in or takeout, always consistently delicious! Some of my faves are Veal/Eggplant/Chicken Parm (basically all the Parms,) Manicotti, and Linguni with Arrabiata Sauce. Great service, and I love that you get a salad and bread with your meal. You can tell these people really care about their guests and business."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing, the shopping center is trying to revive itself and has been trying since the chef store replaced that awful Wal-mart. Saying so, i usually just have takeout, but I always feel comfortable when I eat in too. The decor and ambiance isn't exactly upscale dining, but the food quality and presentation make a good date night spot for those looking for something \"nice, but not too nice.\" Plus it's a local small business and the guy that owns this place is legit Italian and will quickly bust your balls, which I can appreciate, but I can see if someone more sensitive might get offended. 
Pizza:
I like to think of myself as a pizza connoisseur and this place sets the mark. 
The pizza here is thin crust with a tomato and light basil sauce that is neither too sweet nor bland topped with a quality cheese blend that is just the right amount of saltiness (which is in my opinion the most important part of the pizza equation). The sauce is on the lighter side, so if you are a sauce person you might be disappointed. I usually get a cheese or pepperoni these days, but they also have a Veggie pizza that put any other Veggie pizza you've ever had to shame. It has chunks, not bits and pieces of veggies, like broccoli and onions. If you go during lunch hours you'll be able to get the pizza by the slice, otherwise expect to enjoy an entire pie. The price is on the higher end when comparing this pizza to Papa Johns or Little Caesar's, but trust me there is NO comparison in quality. Totally worth the money.
Salad:
I almost always get the house salad with any order. The dressing is a unique creamy Italian that goes great with the fresh baked mini loaf of bread they give you in addition to your salad. Also they include olives in the salad which I appreciate. Olives can be so under appreciated. 
Italian Dishes:
So if you can't tell I'm basically in love with their pizza, but I've also tried their other food. I must say I'm not as impressed with their baked ziti or Bolognese as I have been with their pizza, but their lasagna and chicken dishes have always done it for me. Chicken piccata is probably my favorite of the chicken dishes I've had their and even have tried to replicate it in my own kitchen! 

Bottom line: Eat here, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to try this place?  Admittedly, the location doesn't jump out at you.  Portofino's is located in a strip mall off of Eastway Drive.  The interior is small, but lovingly decorated in the Italian style.  The music compliments the decor.  
Our server was the nicest man!  He said, \" you look like a wine drinker,\" and offered me a sample of an Italian red that wasn't on the menu.  So good, and it was only $6.00!
My friend got the pasta fagoli soup, and a pasta dish featuring salmon.  I ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini minus the grilled chicken strips.  Our meals came with bread and salads, featuring some if the tastiest blue cheese dressing.  My plentiful dish was so good that I could have drunk the sauce if my manners were subpar.  My leftovers were boxed, and my husband will have a special lunch tomorrow.
When we left, the entire staff said goodbye and thank you.  It is so rare to have everyone smile at you.  Southern hospitality Italian style!"}
{"text":"Had the baked ziti, good sized portions and delicious all the way through.  The fresh baked bread is as good as any dessert that is served.  Super friendly staff and a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I hope this business thrives in this location for a long time.  Its sad that this shopping center has kinda gone the wrong direction.  Once your in Portofino's you forget about the shady people and businesses outside.  I came for lunch with a friend and was promptly seated with and given bread and butter immediately.  The waiter came out several times to refill our drinks and knew I was going to order more.  I must say that at most Italian joints, the calzones and Stromboli's are made fresh in the morning.  This does not allow for custom options.  Here I was able to order a stromboli with lots of marinara sauce without ricotta cheese. Something, I have not seen most places."}
{"text":"My husband choose this place because of the stars on yelp. He wanted to go somewhere different for date night. We were not disappointed at all. We had the calamari.  I had the chicken gorgonzola, he had the chicken parm. I took the tiramisu to go. Our waiter was a sweetheart. We are so going back."}
{"text":"Took my parents to this location Christmas Eve for lunch.  Personally I'm a big lunch person because you pay less for almost the same amount of food as dinner time.  That aside, I've been a long time fan of Portofino's (SouthPark, Ayrsley & Eastway locations). There are days I literally CRAVE their pasta Mediterraneo (I always order mine with capellini).  For $7, you can't beat this.  Chopped seafood (definitely has calamari in it) with mussels and all stirred up in a creamy pink sauce... this is my FAV pasta choice.  And yes, I almost always order this dish, which is soooo against my normal rule of trying new things.

Don't forget their bread, which is baked freshly... and a little tip: dip it in their house salad dressing!  OMG... it's awesome! (NOTE: if you are allergic to garlic, or don't like garlic, or don't want to smell like garlic, don't attempt this... but then why on earth are you in an italian restaurant?!)

Their other dishes are good too.  Pizza is huge, and was told to be very authentic NY style.  At my old work we used to order them for lunch, and the cheese would slide all over the place by the time I got it back to work because it's so fresh and hot (hence I'm not a pizza delivery person)

This location isn't as \"fancy\" looking, but it's close to my home.  For more romantic outings... you may want to drive a little further to the Park Road or Ayrsley location."}
{"text":"A hidden spot in a not so hot part of town.  This place was recommended by friends and we've dined in a time or two.  They have a few key servers that have worked for them for several years.  If you're lucky enough to get one of them you will have phenomenal service.  If not, you may find yourself waiting for refills and such for longer than desired.  The pizza is about what you'd expect; typical \"New York Style\" pizza but quite greasy.  The bread served at the table is AMAZING and is even better if you ask for a side of their house dressing for dipping!  Trust me on this one!  I've tried a few other menu items beyond the pizza.  Some good, some not so good.  It all depends on your taste and familiarity.  Most dishes that I didn't like were the result of me branching out to try a little something new.  All in all, it's decent Italian food.  I was a little put off during my last trip by the servers attempt to \"charge\" for a refill of the bread basket for the table.  Had never heard of such nonsense before.  Seriously?  Can I see a manager please?  That's what I thought!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday evening.  I had missed lunch and was starving.  I rarely get over to this part of town and it had been well over a year since I had visited.  So even though it was only 4:45 PM, I figured I would visit again.  So glad I did.

Even though it was so early, there were already a few tables filled and the carryout pizza was flying out the door.  By the time I left a little after 6:00, the place was pretty full.

I was promptly greeted and seated, and quickly attended to by my server Todd.  Great guy.  Very friendly.  His service was stellar.

I started with the appetizer special of a large Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a crab filling and topped with a balsamic reduction and served over a bed of sautéed spinach.  Delicious. I followed with a entre special of Osso Bucco (did I spell that right?) with a side of Gnocchi.  Again, simply delicious.  

All in all, a terrific experience.  Great food and service, with a comfortable and quaint atmosphere.  I'll need to try harder to get over that way more often......"}
{"text":"McKenzie is our waiter for the evening and she should be a comedian part-time. She brought our food out hot & ready before we even finished our salads. Great personality and humor added to a delightful evening."}
{"text":"I have had take out and dine in here and I just love this place. It is a quaint little Italian place where the atmosphere make you feel like you are in Italy. So far I have had most all types of pizza here, chicken parmigiana, lasagna, salads, pretty much almost the whole menu. Take out is great too, even they way they pack your food. I can call it in on my way home from work and its always ready. I am fortunate to live a mile away from here. 

If you get the chance visit this place or order take out. It is great food at a great price, and customer service is always great!"}
{"text":"I have to put five *s for Portofino Eastway as the quality of the food is matched by the quality of service combined with the reasonable price.  Their specials are designed to impress the palate as well as your important guests. Everyday value is attainable in the pasta and pizza section along w/ a healthy lunch menu. I have a buddy from out of town who plans visits here that ensure we eat at \"Portofinos\". There you have it. I offer a strong recomendation for you to add this location to your restaurant choices."}
{"text":"best italian food i've had in Charlotte, the pizzas are great, the puttanesca is some of the best i've had, the chicken gorgonzola is no joke, and the tiramisu even my old italian dad loved when he visited."}
