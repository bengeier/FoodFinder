{"text":"2 months ago I visited this place.

 Waiters are polite, owner seems nice but man, the food wasn't what I expected! The food was raw, arancini sucked, it was as if they were frozen, the salmon tartar didn't taste too good, and also the gnocchi poutine tasted really salty. The prosciutto was really bad because  it tasted way too hard, salty and weird.


The pizzas were okay. Nothing great. For the price I paid, I didn't get my money's worth!

 I wish them all good luck, but I won't be returning, any time soon!"}
{"text":"First off we waited 2 and half hours for our food. Everything is way over priced. Taste was okay but not exceptional. Our plates were taken away from us barely a minute after having finished. 
The portions of pasta were very small. The pizza was good but not many topping on the actual pizza. Mostly dough to be honest. We had the gnocchi poutine (sounded interesting) it was tasty but WAY too salty. 
The place was so crowded I could barely walk to the bathroom and so ridiculously loud. We were so crammed our elbows were touching. 
Don't waste your money. 65$ for 2 on a mediocre meal..."}

Nice clean restaurant.
Plenty of parking.
Good value for prices.
Upscale neighborhood Italian restaurant, that if I lived in the area would go back.  Long trip from Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I have been to many Italian restaurants and have tried many meals, but Buon Gusto is on a whole other level. First of all the presentation is just beautiful, and the taste is even better. The portions are large and the price is very reasonable. The service is great, very friendly, the owner actually took the time to come by and ask if we enjoyed our food. It was my first time there but I already know this is gonna be a place I go to every week. The only disappointment was the fact that I have been living in this area for 25 years and never thought of going. I can't believe I missed out all these years. I recommend this place to all those you are truly looking for home made Italian greatness."}
