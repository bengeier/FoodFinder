{"text":"OMG! Please eat here! New to the area looking for Vietnamese food and tried SL because of all the great reviews. We go a few times a month now! 
-Food is delicious and HOT upon arrival to your table which I love.
-Large portions for great pricing. I always end up really full or asking for to-go boxes. 
-Very courteous and professional wait staff. (Don't think they ever get the order wrong because they repeat it back to you to be sure. If you're new to Vietnamese food they'll walk you through or explain what items are but the menu is very detailed as well so you know exactly what you're ordering).
-Clean restaurant (and I'm weird about things like that. To me, if the place is not clean the food isn't either) but SL is on point.
-Kid friendly. I have a 7, 2 and 1 yr old and they love SL"}
{"text":"I have tried just about every Vietnamese spot on the West side. This has consistently been my favorite. The pho is great, and the beef stew is phenomenal. The flavor of the beef stew has me hooked! They have a great happy hour with cheaper drinks and apps as well. The staff is very friendly, and the food comes out fast. The atmosphere is peaceful, yet casual, and very clean. I highly recommend you try Song Lynn."}
{"text":"CLOSED WEDNESDAY!!!! Went there last wednesday but they were CLOSED. We'll try again this week."}
{"text":"Great Pho, friendly people, and reasonably priced.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"In my great adventure of trying new foods, I found this cute little place. Now I had heard about Pho and wanted to try it, they have so many options and such good food I want to go again tonight....in fact I might try to go again!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was amazing. We will definitely be back for some more. It was the perfect amount to share !"}
{"text":"I loved the pork vermicelli, the banh mi, and the egg rolls. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I loved eating here! I've been to a few Vietnamese restaurants, and this one is one of my top ones. The atmosphere is great, and the service is as well. I got the Pho with rare beef and brisket. It was very delicious. Their Thai iced tea is also incredible. I've been to several places with Thai tea, and this one is probably my favorite. Overall, it is a great Vietnamese restaurant, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yum! There aren't many options for non-fast food lunch around here, so I was very glad to discover Song Lynn today! Really yummy Pho, reasonably priced and very fast service.  I ordered take out and my order was ready and waiting when I arrived.  They also automatically included a small container of plum sauce, and sriracha with my to-go order which I appreciated! Natch they also sent along basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapenos and limes, plus the raw beef to add to the soup.  (It cooks up deliciously!) I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Mostly clean environment. 
Friendly staff. 
Quality of food is what killed it. The food was like top ramen in comparison to the Pho I've had elsewhere. Definitely not the comfort food that proper Pho is."}
{"text":"Poor service take WAAAAAAY too long for just an order of spring rolls. I waiting over 20mins. To go and the restaurant is empty! I'm upset enough that I do not even feel like eating my food. I arrived at 5pm and got my food at 5:30pm. Let me say again it was one order of spring rolls! Omg never again."}
{"text":"This is a new Pho place and the only Pho's restaurant near Tolleson, its good compare to the place on 43th Ave.  The price is reasonable, they are high tech I visited their website and noticed that they take online, what I unmeaning by high tech is that every order is done through an ipad. I normally Pho large bowl (its not large like Da Vang) but its okay, they offer fish sauce but you have to ask for it I also noticed that they don't really have that much topping, you have to understand that I'm Laos. Meaning our topping normally include fried garlic, green onion, chili oil sauce..etc...But over all this place is good and would recommend for Pho lover in the neighborhood. I'm actually going there right now.."}
{"text":"I assumed this would be a good place to eat Vietnamese cuisine, seeing as how it had 4 out of 5 stars. I was not at all impressed. The pho broth was too sweet, as was the nuc mam sauce for the egg rolls and vermicelli noodle dish. The egg rolls tasted strange and the goi con was fresh but did not have any mint or green onions wrapped in with the noodles, pork and shrimp. Very bland. And the peanut sauce was diluted. I don't believe that Song Lynn is a true Vietnamese restaurant as the name is not authentic and there are Chinese dishes on the menu. We sat in front of the TV that sits too high in the wall. The radio and TV were on at the same time which made it loud and difficult to concentrate on one sound. Sadly, I will not ever eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, pho soup (chicken) is delicious and their chicken and white rice as well. Reasonable prices and great customer service :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 5 star only because the food is amazing.  Finally I'm able to enjoy asian, vietnamese food and tell everyone.  I love the flavor of the Pho soup, the fried rice was to die for.  We are defenitively coming back.  I would though get the server to move and be more alert, if you are in any rush then you will be late, if you are just there to chill with family and friends then is a great overall place to eat.  Clean, nicely decorate, sweet staff."}
{"text":"I want to beat the owner's butt because they won't put salty lemonade on the menu. Otherwise my new favorite pho restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Vietnamese food on the west side. Big clean place with good service. Love the beef rolls and pho."}
{"text":"Came into this place w high expectations, since everyone I talk to tells me they love this place! The atmosphere was comfy and chill, my friend kassie and I were impressed. Our waiter was nice and patient and helped us out, she was so sweet. So atmosphere and customer service wise, this place is a 10. Now for the food. 
I got the Spring Rolls with pork, and my friend got spring rolls with shrimp and steak. I also got Pho with meatballs and Thai Tea Boba. the spring Rolls were delicious, I love the BBQ pork, it's my favorite thing ever. It only had one small slice of the pork, I wish it would have had more, though. The spring roll was big, but it just needed a little more pork! Perfect none the less. The Pho was amazing, broth was really good, but I was so sad because I put the wrong chili, there was 3 different types and the chili I put made my pho taste more smokey, but it was so good anyways. I couldn't even finish my bowl honestly, I was so so so full half way. It makes me sad when that happens. The Thai Tea boba wasn't as good, honestly. The boba was sticky and chewy. The Thai tea itself was just like any other Thai Tea haha. But it was still drinkable so I can't even complain. The food came out QUICK and the employee was so nice to us cause we kept asking for things, I kind of felt bad haha. Really good to go out w a friend or two and really just dig in, we were so full. Thank you, pho real! (Get it ahhhhh)"}
{"text":"I have just fractured my ankle by tripping over a log on a fishing trip. Yes, it is sad. However, every cloud does have a silver lining and I found this misadventures at Song Lynn. You see, it is just a small jump away from the Emergency Room that I went to!
The food is great, the service is fantastic, and the pricing is perfect. 
I plan on telling all of my friends about this gem of a restaurant - with any luck they'll have to expand until they reach my neck of the woo.. eh, desert."}
{"text":"I tried pho for the 1st time , it was so delicious!!:) the staff was super friendly, I'll definitely be coming back,"}
{"text":"my favorite place to eat. Great service pleasant staff and service. Definitely the best Vietnamese place."}
{"text":"Seriously yum! PHO GA & PORK, SHRIMP SPRING ROLLS with fresh hot tea. Yang was an awesome server! Coming back!"}
{"text":"Good place to come, had the chicken pho service was good to. Also had the spring roll very good"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Pho! and they deliver! Beautiful inside, very upscale for the location. Love the staff, very personable. We have loved everything we have had and we will continue coming for years to come!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! The owners were very friendly and came over to speak with us and show us around the restaurant. I I highly recommend this restaurant. Great food and good decor. The paintings are even from Vietnamese students in Vietnam!"}
{"text":"We are so happy to have a PHO place on the westside! The decor is great. Clean, modern, and relaxing. We got seated right away and the staff was very attentive. I had questions on the menu and they had the manager personally explain it to me. We got the egg rolls, PHO, and fried rice. Everything was delicious and we will definately be back again soon. They also took our order on a mini iPAD which made the food come out super fast and accurate."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 was served very quickly by the kitchen staff and our server was very attentive. I look forward to coming back soon, I had the large \"P2\" with spring rolls and hot tea. My soup was solid, spring rolls perfect size, and tea was hot. 

The price was affordable, I am happy that a good Pho place is so close to home. 

I will certainly be bringing my family back soon."}
{"text":"I've been feeling under the weather all week and figured what better way to get a pick me up than my favorite Vietnamese spot? We walked in and noticed they've got some new seating. Beautiful booths! I love the decor and atmosphere in this place and the staff are just the best. 

My boyfriend ordered the beef stew with bread (his favorite) and I had the pho with dumplings. The broth in the pho is delicious and comforting like a warm hug. Every time I eat it I wonder why I don't eat it every day."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but both times the food has been consistently great! I've had their egg rolls and the \"P8\" which is the well done brisket and beef broth Pho. Even my not so open to try new things fiancé and son loved this place. Trust that's saying a lot because they are picky eaters. I'm so glad I finally found a good spot for Pho close to home!"}
{"text":"What a good Vietnamese restaurant! They have the best Vietnamese food here. Especially the pho, it is super delicious. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have a Vietnamese Restaurant close to home! They just opened on June 4 and they include 10% off for their grand opening. I ordered P10 to go (Pho with well done steak). The staff looked absolutely thrilled to have their new restaurant and they were just as friendly! Great food at great prices. Can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant and the food taste so good . I loved the service here I would defiantly come again"}
{"text":"We order the Vietnamese sandwhich and egg rolls and it was super delicious. Service was great and place was clean."}
{"text":"Hands down best pho in Phoenix (most likely AZ as well). I'm sure a lot of people agree with me because its always hard to find parking. That's when you know the food is popping!  Staff are friendly, restaurant is new looking, and prices are very reasonable. They even have happy hour for appetizers etc !!!  I recommend any type of pho on their menu honestly the broth has a very rich and hearty flavor. 10/10"}
{"text":"Not the best Viatnamese I've had, but still yummy. Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pho, so I decided to check this place out. 

I started with tofu spring rolls, these were delicious. I've had spring rolls before where the tofu was raw. I do believe the tofu in these were fried which gave the spring roll a really nice texture. The peanut sauce was delicious, I added some sirracha to give it a kick.

I ordered the won-ton soup it was piping hot, the rice noodles were amazing! 

The waiter was attentive but did not hover which I appreciate. My experience here was great and the price is right."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places I've been to. The only bad side is that the prices were a little too high considering the portions are smaller than what I'm used to from other pho places. I asked to add extra meat which came to an up charge of $2. Not bad. Also, the broth was super flavorful. Everything inside looked clean and the service was good. Highly recommend if you want to try a new pho place."}
{"text":"I had pho with chicken dumplings and they were exquisite and I like how clean the restaurant was. Service was also immediate and server was very kind and listened to us carefully. I will come again!"}
{"text":"Very fast! Very good!! Very friendly service!!!

   My past experiences with Vietnamese restaurants has been slow and bearable because the food is typically so good. Here? Nope. All the food was out faster than I could blink. And it is all soooo good. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have tried just about every Vietnamese restaurant in the West Valley.  Song Lynn by far has the best Pho we've had, and the serves is friendly!  We usually have P1 and P2, we have tried their spring rolls, fried egg rolls, and their Thai Tea.  The Thai Tea was a little too sweet, but the rest....Just Amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow the minute we walked in ,the service is awesome ( Maria ) gave it a spark, we felt welcome ... The food is very good not to pricey just right to go Back again and again. Love Vietnamese food just minutes from our home ...Thanks Song Lynn !!"}
{"text":"I'm super stoked to have found this quaint little gem of a place.. I always order PHO when my husband and go out for Vietnamese however tonight I had the Pad Thai and I was NOT dissapointed! We also had the egg rolls which were standard but enjoyable. 
I'll definitely order it again! 
My husband enjoyed his chx noodle soup...(PHO w/o veg) 
Upon entering I noticed smiling faces & nodding in a welcoming way which was inviting and they keep it very clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. 
Super close to home,  we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE PHO! This place is definitely the BEST Pho in the West Valley. I often travel all across AZ to get a good bowl of Pho. Song Lynn is among my favorite Pho spots and it is your best option if you live in the far West Valley. Its clean, modern, service is quick and they accommodate an array of options from vegetarian, gluten free etc.The Banh mi are fresh and the bread is so soft and crispy. The Spring Rolls are made to order and the portions of Pho are quite generous. We usually order appetizers and share a large bowl of pho P1 or P12. The Curry is fantastic and the Song Lynn Special (S1) Is amazing, Its a nest of noodles and fresh stir fried veggies with your choice of meats. I love how they already know what I usually order and how I like it prepared. I love extra limes and jalapenos and they always accompany my pho. They are very attentive and  I come here several times per week because the food is consistently delicious! Happy Hour is from 3-7pm but prices are great all day. You can literally have a Vietnamese feast for less than $25 bucks!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into most Pho spots you are one pointed to a table by someone who looks harried & almost too busy to pay attention to greet you. But it's Pho & if it's good you will not only overlook that you will graciously sit on what can only be a chair leftover from the 70's banquet scene & be perfectly happy doing it. 
That is not case at this place. It is newer, clean & the staff lovely. Loved the Beef Pho & spring rolls with BBQ meat! So yummy & on my side of town. I've been driving far & wide to what was the best Pho place in my opinion in town. However cleanliness, good Pho & on my side of town...  I will probably never darken their door way again.This is my new Pho spot. Just typing this I'm thinking a Pho lunch is in order. So go & Pho!"}
{"text":"I honestly was expecting the portions to be decent with a regular size pho bowl that costs 7.95. They could be a little bit more generous with the portions and the broth was too sweet. I'll stick with Pho 43rd Express from here on out. They could do better than this."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here many times, and we are always extremely pleased.  The staff is always friendly, and the restaurant is clean.  Also decorated very well.  The Pho is soo tasty..let's just say that I now have an obsession with Vietnamese food :P."}
{"text":"I love their Pho! Such great flavor! I was surprised at how fast the service was. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"i stll love this place!!  the food is fast affordable and so delicious.  

Pro- the menu has a great selection for every picky eater.  clean and friendly service everytime.  Pho has lots of flavor and options can accommodate chicken lovers, beef lovers and vegie lovers.  i highly suggest the spring rolls. 

Con- if you like it spicey you will need to use 2x the amount at the table."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hidden lunch spots! 
Their pho is delicious and we love the pork egg rolls. The atmosphere is nice, and employees are all very friendly and accomodating. 
Delivery is quick, and they include everything you need to spice up your pho.
I'm so glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would! I am absolutely furious with the events that happened during my pickup order last Sunday! Please everyone check your receipts and make sure they are not adding tips to your bills even when you clearly marked out the tip line and put a total for a pick up order (I usually tip if I am dining in, but not for take-out). My receipt showed one amount but my statement had another. The excuse I was given for this error was a glitch in the system which made no sense in my situation. Their solution was for me to drive back to the place, which I live about 20 minutes from and only went here because they had good ratings, to get the tip refund. If this was my business I would have fully refunded my customer the entire bill in order to ensure they returned in the future. This place has lost my business for sure!"}
{"text":"We still go here every once in a while, but what we have found out is that its still cheaper to drive to Da Vangs than to visit Song Lynn. We can get 2 orders of Pho and Bahn Mi at Da Vangs and pay $15 (including a 20% tip). At Song Lynn that same meal costs almost $30.

Overpriced but very good. The nicely re-worked menu is saving them from dropping to 3 stars in my book. Everyone is still very nice, but even with gas factored in its cheaper to drive to central Phoenix from the west valley.

Sorry guys, we won't be coming back as often as we have in the past. Still a good place, if you don't mind spending a little extra."}
{"text":"I am sorry for ruining everyone 's raving reviews about this place, but it was a total disappointment for me. Everything was salty and awful. It is overpriced for the poor quality of food. It's not an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. The restroom is nasty, dirty and gross for the supposed to be \"upscale\" restaurant. Nothing is upscale about this place. The food is only cater toward Caucasians and non-Asian groups who know NOTHING about fine Asian dining. However, I am VERY Impressed with the outstanding service which you can hardly achieve that in any Asian restaurant. For the wait staff, I would give a 5-star!"}
{"text":"Good portions, would prefer if servers would bring fresh glass for beverage refills- I'm pretty sure I ended up with someone else's glass that was getting refilled and that's a major issue. Pho is tasty and filling, plenty for  leftovers later."}
{"text":"I've recently moved from moon valley to 96 th off camelback and wanted to find a great orcas good pho restrurant as I've loved on bell and 47th Ave. I was so amazed how good this restrurant was and they had the best potstickers I've ever eaten. The soups are my favorite and I just wanted to express my happiness and thoughts. Really great place!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to have Pho... I have tried several places around The Valley and I always come back to this place for a good Pho.. service is great and the place is very clean... most definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love Song Lynn. Pho is so good and the service is top notch. The restaurant is also very clean and modern. Everyone is friendly but GG is their main waitress, she remember us, and knows exactly what we order; she is amazing."}
{"text":"I've been trying Pho places all over the valley.  This is by far my favorite so far.  Great broth, didn't have to add anything except some chili sauce to spice it up.  Great flavor.  The only problem is that you really must buy the large bowl to get enough.  

The large bowl should just be their default bowl I think."}
{"text":"Third time here and still the best place for Pho in PHX.  The P1 (large) is always delicious with generous amount of meats. The rice noodles and broth always taste great.  The service is fast and pleasant.  Our server checked on us numerous times and filled our drinks in a good rhythm.  She was just very friendly and helpful, making some good recommendations.  

We come from San Diego where there's quite a few awesome Vietnamese restaurants and we're always on the hunt since moving to PHX.  We had our favorite place in San Diego named Pho Cao Doa and now I think we've found our new favorite...Song Lynn's."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp! This place is a do over do over and another do over! By far some of the best Vietnamese food we've ever eaten. The place is immaculately clean the food is unbelievable and the proportions are more than generous. Best part can't beat the prices will be back again probably tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 1 Star is because they gave good service.  After seeing their rating of 4.5 stars and the good reviews I was extremely disappointed.  My family had ordered a couple bowls of large size P1(Pho Dac Biet) and a large bowl of Bun Bo Hue.  The $10.50 they charge for the portion of a large bowl was not worth it.  The meat they gave was like cheap scrap meat and on top of that they didn't even put the right cut of meat in the Bun Bo Hue.  Not sure if they ran out of the correct meat and just substituted with whatever they had left.  I definitely will not come back!"}
{"text":"Song lynn is bomb-diggity. The lady and I like the yellow curry chicken and the filet mignon with bell peppers, onions, tomatoes stir fry dish. Oh yeah their crispy spring rolls are second to none."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Extremely disappointed. My fiancé and I had pho. She's Vietnamese and she knows her broth. The broth was simply chicken stock. Pho broth is very complex. It has star anise, cinnamon and other fragrant spices that were not in this broth. The owner has got to know that her broth is subpar! How could you not? And if a Vietnamese restaurant does not take pride in their pho, then I don't care to try other items.

On the other hand, service was good. But I won't return to a restaurant for bad food with good service."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Clean, free wifi, reasonable, and THE BEST PHO pho MILES.  Legitimate pho broth, and the classic vermicelli fried rolls as well as the fresh rice rolls are exactly what you'd expect.  Awesome Vietnamese coffee (drip, and mixed with condensed milk).  I come from the hospital across the street almost every night I'm on call; the only time I can't (and the only complaint I have) is on Wednesdays, which are closed."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time today with a Groupon and was super impressed.  The servers were very friendly and efficient, even though they knew I had a Groupon.  The food came out in a flash, too.  I had the shrimp, pork and sausage combo with an avocado shake with boba, and both were very good.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly,  open when many are not,  beer and wine,  great food and they encourage you to ask for anything you need with a bell at each table."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, has courteous prompt service. The pho is very good. The both is very tasty. Inside of restaurant is very clean. Love the spring rolls. Pricing is very reasonable. Very good place to eat."}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped by here mostly because I love pho but in reality we were wasting time till the concert started. I ordered my usual pho and it was wonderful. I have nothing to complain about. Their menu is large so there are many options. Overall, the service and food was good. I recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho, excellent service. Very clean quiet place with friendly people. The P2 meatballs were tough and stringy, and there wasn't a lot of meat. The vegetable/herb plate was kind of lean too, but they brought more when I asked. The combo appetizer plate was delicious. Overall this is a solid choice for pho in the west valley."}
{"text":"Was looking for something late night one night. Couldn't think of anywhere I could got for some great Phò. Someone mentioned this place to me that I had completely forgotten and every time I wanted to try this place I'd go on the days the restaurant is closed. Finally, I got to try it. Omg! Phò is amazing and so are their shrimp spring rolls. Such friendly people and service. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"I called in a to-go order which was ready when I arrived 15 minutes later. The lady who took my order was friendly and answered my questions about the different pho sizes available. The overall look of the restaurant inside is updated, attractive, and clean. The lady who took my payment inside was friendly but abandoned her post as soon as she handed me the receipt to sign, which I had to leave the signed copy next to the unattended cash register. The pho was delicious and full of all the flavors you want in a good pho. It was one of the best I've tried! I wish they offered chow mein on their menu. But since they don't, I ordered their chicken fried rice. It was just okay... it was a bit dry and lacking in flavor. But I will be back for their pho!"}
{"text":"This is the go to place in the West Valley! I enjoy the food and the friendly service. My friend and I come to eat here about twice a week. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean!!  Service fast and friendly. I'd been here twice and I'm just happy this place is so close to me.  I like that u have the option of getting regular size or large bowl of pho.  Since everywhere I'd been before only serves the huge kind of bowls that I end up finishing and feeling miserable for over eating. (Yeah that is my bad not the restaurant's) 
The reason they don't get 5 stars is cause even when Pho broth is good and light it was still missing something in the flavor.  I have no idea what, but definitely misses something.  Definitely not the best I had but not bad at all!! Spring rolls are big and good. My daughter love the fried rolls. 
I will definitely recommend this place and will be a regular customer for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place was easy to get to, no fuss, just like most standard Vietnamese restaurants. The staff was friendly, and we were immediately seated for dinner. The pan fried flat rice noodle with chicken (S3) was fantastic. The flavor was great and the pan fried noodles just added more to that taste. The Pho with rare beef, brisket, and flank (P12) was total comfort food. The regular size was enough for me. Good place to go for affordable, satisfying food."}
{"text":"Dropped into this restaurant on a whim after getting my nails done a few doors down and it was amazing! I was seated immediately and quickly brought out my iced green tea. I ordered the number 9 which is pho with rare beef and brisket and it was delivered to my table within 6 minutes. The pho itself was some of the best I have had, very flavorful broth and tender meat. The one thing I also really loved was how attentive they were to my water/tea glass when it got empty, within my last sip someone was already there to refill it. Overall, awesome experience!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here for lunch to show my boyfriend my favorite Vietnamese dishes aside from pho. 

Ordered the nam nuong cuon as an appetizer. Right off the bat, I noticed that the pork/nam was rather brown compared to the red colored meat that I'm use to seeing. Also, they did not have the fried egg roll wrapper that's traditionally wrapped inside. 
For my main entree, I ordered the bun tom thit nuong cha gio and my boyfriend the mi xao don tom. I would order his dish a second time. 

It's hard for me to find a notable Vietnamese restaurant since I'm spoiled by home cooked meals at home. Overall, everything was decent so I would come back again."}
{"text":"Finally found a Vietnamese restaurant that is clean and has great food. Great pho and spring/egg rolls combo. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The waiters are really nice. Their egg rolls and pho is really good. :) I always find myself coming back here."}
{"text":"The family is in love with this place. Have been here a few times and the service is great. This type of food is not my cup of tea however everyone is happy."}
{"text":"We have had very good pho having lived in the Bay Area with so much computing to make good pho.

The broth is what makes it breaks pho.

We have eaten pho at several places in the phoenix area - phoenix proper and in the east valley. 
The broth here is the best we have tasted in phoenix.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unsure what we wanted for dinner, we stopped at Song Lynn for pho. It was your standard pho with beef. Nothing to write home about. The one my son had was red with a meatier broth and very flavorful noodles."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Ordered on doordash for dinner one evening and then went back a few days later for lunch.  Fast service, good food and pretty reasonable.  Will become a lunch staple for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! I come all the time and get the pho tai. Only place on the west side that nails it. The servers here are INCREDIBLE. They are so sweet and cute! Kitchen is super clean and you can see it from the front dining room. I love Vu the owner as well. Yay song Lynn!"}
{"text":"More than decent pho! My girlfriend and I come here often. Prices are fair. Only complaint might be the smaller portions of meat in the p2, but it's quite good nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Awesome Pho and amazing friendly staff experience!  Couldn't have been nicer!  The place is very clean and the menu is extensive!  Will definitely be back to try more options!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant... Great service, great food. Love the Pho,  spring rolls,  egg rolls and more...  Taste the same everytime I come around"}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles, where one can choose from a slew of Pho veitnamese restuarunts"}
{"text":"Really disappointed by the pho! I ordered the spicy beef with lemongrass. The beef seemed low quality - fatty, chewy, not appealing. There was a heavy layer of grease on top of the broth and the broth itself lacked flavor. The noodles were thicker than I have ever had in pho and seemed to have consistency that they had been in liquid for too long."}
{"text":"After seeing an ROTD for this place and reading the reviews, I thought this was worth a visit even though it was quite a bit of a drive. It's one of only a few businesses in operation in a large commercial square, but the square itself as well as this restaurant are clean and well-maintained. Inside, the atmosphere was cozy and the  very friendly server had me seated at once. I started with two very good grilled beef spring rolls, followed by pho with tripe, tendon, and meatballs. The flavor of the pho broth here is the cleanest and freshest I've had of all the Vietnamese restaurants I've tried in the Valley; there was no overpowering cinnamon flavor to hide the more delicate flavors such as lemongrass. The tendon was tender and the tripe was sliced into very thin strips, the way I like tripe in pho. I finished the meal with an avocado shake which was thick without being heavy and with just the right level of sweetness. Free WiFi was available, too. Though the prices are just a tad higher than in most Vietnamese restaurants, that is justified by the quality of the food, the service, and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Food, fast service. Try their combo fried rice with Chinese sausage and grilled pork chops. Delicious!!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"They have the most amazing Korean Beef BBQ ribs. They are tender with the right amount of seasoning. They have a nice selection of Korean not Chinese food. It is a warm environment with kind people. Special orders no problem. Everyone was nice and helpful. It is a clean restaurant that even smells good. Come eat here!"}
{"text":"Don't pay any attention to the other reviewer's negative comments...this place is excellent.  I've had Pho from Texas to California so I know my Pho. The Pho here is one of the best...the broth is hot and very clean, just enough meat and just a hint of anise...portion size is perfect.  The springrolls are average...Little Saigon in downtown Glendale puts shrimp & grilled pork in their springrolls.  I have also had the curry chicken and the mongolian beef which  both come with white rice and both delicious with high quality meat & lightly flavored & not overly sauced. Okay now the negative...other than the Pho, the portion size of food is too 
small...you get 1/3 of what other vietnamese restaurants serve. For $8.95 I expect more than white rice & a small fist size of Mongolian beef or curry chicken...I guess I will just stick to the Pho & sandwiches."}
{"text":"If I can't make it to Da Vang, I come here. Its closer to my house. Anywho, the dining experience here is great. Service is very good! Each table has a call button attached to the wall that will page them when pressed. Thats a great way and attempt to make sure they attend to you. The format of seating in the restaurant is a little different and forms an \"L\" shape which is also why I'm sure they have the buttons for. The times I've come here, the restaurant is clean. Dirty was never an issue the times I've eaten here. My favorite is the bbq chicken pho, as for appetizers I like the eggrolls. The grilled chicken with fried rice. I'm simple but I love flavor. Its the best one yet I know on the west side of town. I've been here a few times and I always leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Today is my first day going to this Vietnamese restaurant, and the waitress she was really cute and nice, but the thing that tick me off was usually when people order a plate that has rice they should give a free small broth on the side. This old guy which seem like his a boss there he said the broth is free with my rice, but when I paid and look at the price they charged me for the soup that they say it was \"FREE\". I compared my receipt to the price in the order book and it was different. So they did charge for my small bowl of broth. So whoever goes there please check your recipes and make sure they don't charge you extra money. I would've paid extra money if they would tell me the truth, but instead they lied to me saying its free and yet they charge me extra money."}
{"text":"Such delicious pho! Crowded on Fridays and weekends but that's because it's so good. Affordable and high quality, very friendly and polite staff."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Pho tasted good. Their prices were higher than other pho restaurants but the size of the bowl was tiny, so value was not that great at all. Service was just ok. They were friendly but seemed busy with other people. One thing this place has are great banh mi....especially the grilled pork. Probably the best I've tasted. But again, size was small and price was higher than average. I would suggest to try the banh mi though."}
{"text":"Banh mi has very little meat. I was mostly eating bread. Because of this I had to order two... And I still didn't get full. The bit of meat that WAS in there was poor quality- mostly fat and ended up giving me a sour stomach. I also ordered an avocado milk shake and it tasted sssoooo bad! No sugar in this shake whatsoever! I told server that I didn't like it and it tasted bad, she ended up exchanging it for strawberry but only after much convincing. The strawberry shake was of poor poor taste as well. I ended up throwing it away- it was that bad. I see everyone raving about their pho. Maybe that's their one and only forte."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find the food was great the service was  perfect (Gi Gi )rocks .Clean restaurant with a large  menu. Try the Vietnamese iced coffee  better than any starbucks."}
{"text":"I drive across town just for SL. They're the best. Food is great, staff is friendly -- I couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"My go to pho spot! I always get a P19 (pho with dumplings) and it's always fresh, delicious and fast."}
{"text":"My dad was visiting from texas and loves vietnamese food so we decided to try Song Lynn after seeing a movie. 

We got our food to go but the girl who took our order was very friendly and helpful. Our food was packaged nice and secure which i definitely appreciated. 

We ordered two kinds of pho, chicken fried rice, crispy chicken wontons and vietnamese spring rolls. 

The portions were very generous with a good amount of meat. The crispy wontons were very tasty and were even still hot when we got home. The soft spring rolls were pretty bland even with the dipping sauce so i will probably skip those next time. 

Their bahn mi looked very tasty so i will definitely be hitting them up again to try some other things."}
{"text":"I had the curry! It was Amaze! Fast service. Clean place. I'll be eating here more often for sure"}
{"text":"By far our favorite spot for Pho and it's just down the street!  It's not much different than Central King Eggroll as far as the food goes...there's a few slight differences in their eggrolls and their meat is slightly thicker than Central King's. Get yourself a P7 (rare beef).  I had some issues with gallstones this last summer before having my gallbladder removed, so I was munching on their P14 (chicken) for awhile and it was just as tasty.  You basically can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  

But I can tell you...the actual restaurant and the service is loads better!  We usually have the same waitress and she is someone that always deserves that 20% tip!  Try out their homemade lemonade...they had squeeze it and add a bit of soda water to it so there's a slight fizz to it.  Yum yum!  

Each table also has a little button you can press when they are super slammed, but we have seriously never ever had a problem with service here unlike at Central King.  Don't forget either...there is a back room here so if it looks too crowded in the front, don't walk out!  

I can literally eat Pho here once a week and still be totally fine!"}
{"text":"Relaxing and quiet. The service was quick and food was delicious, not short on serving size, and I love the call button so your not waiting for someone to walk by. I had the BBQ chicken pho, the only thing I'd change, my chicken kind of tasted like light cinnamon which I'm not really a fan of but it was still good. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Seriously good Pho. Prompt service even at lunch. Very clean. Make sure to try the Vietnamese iced coffee if you want a true pick-me-up for your day!!"}
{"text":"I tried this Vietnamese place near where I live. The spring rolls were just ok. I've had better. They were plain and bland. Could use more veggies. Now the phö broth is delicious! I even think it's better than the usual place I go to for phö. Good to know cause this place is closer."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a regular there now, great food for affordable pricing. Nice atmosphere with amazing service in which I take all my friends and families too and haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere. Nice piano music, great service, the NFL game was discreetly playing quietly in the corner on a huge screen, and the food was great! 

I got the Pad Thai with chicken, for lunch. It was perfectly spicy but not as many noodles as I hoped (but I am odd - I love many a noodle). It was very tasty though no doubt. 
I also got the Thai Tea which was wonderfully sweet and soooo yummy. 

My wife and I totaled 2 drinks and 2 meals for $26 which is not bad. The food wasn't EXCEPTIONALLY killer, but the atmosphere was just so bright and healthy, coupled with great service, making the meal much better than average. If you like Vietnamese, there is no reason not to come!! And you can grab your latte across the street after you eat!! Haha (Starbucks).
 
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho spot on the west side, or I like to get Pho 43 express..the broth has really good flavor..usually get steak and tendon or brisket..not much for tripe..some sprouts, jalapeños, black pepper, oil and couple shots of sirracha to round it out..spring rolls or a Bahn Minh sandwich if I have a bigger appetite..good quality food"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I must say I really liked it! The pho was delicious and they have great service! :)"}
{"text":"This place was great! It was quick, clean and the good was SO GOOD! I got the chicken pad Thai and my bf got the pho. It's a small place, but we came in On a Monday night so it wasn't crazy! We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Best pho in the West valley hands down. I am a regular. Staff is very friendly and service is very fast."}
{"text":"First timer: I don't have a ton of experience with Vietnamese but found the Pho to be tasty and filling. I also had the eggrolls which came out super crispy and piping hot! Reading some of the reviews I'm unsure what people were talking about when they said some of the portions were small... My spicy beef and lemongrass pho (p11?) was full of noodles and savory broth. The female server was truly quite pleasant and plenty attentive. The restaurant appeared quite clean and leaned towards a modern interior."}
{"text":"First time eating here and was very impressed by the cleanliness, exceptional service and great food!!   We will definitely be back!

Five star *****"}
{"text":"Good Service, great food So much flavor! Food made with love. First Vietnamese restaurant I tried, loved it! Recently tried another local one... not so much. 
This one's it for Vietnamese food. It's like \"grandma's cooking.\" Small place, waitress was very helpful on recommending what to eat. I'm even kinda jealous to share this with everyone."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese that delivers?! No way!

Yes way.

I will miss living by them, that's how amazing it was."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place with authentic Vietnamese food.  My co-workers and I frequent this place often because you get great fresh food at a good price.  We have always had a good experience at this great little place."}
{"text":"My family & I have been coming here since they first opened. I've tried a lot of different pho since then but nothing compares! Song Lynn is clean & tasty :)"}
{"text":"As soon as we arrived we could smell the aroma from the parking lot. Yum yum!! The Pho is to die for. A hidden gem, don't miss out. We're going here again Friday night, delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have tried almost all of the pho places in Phoenix, but Song Lynn has got to me my most favorite place to as of right now! Their pork sandwich was delicious. The marinade and overall components of the sandwich satisfied me so much, I wanted another. The only take away is that they are pricier than other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, but Song Lynn is worth it! If you're feeling Vietnamese today/tonight and you live in the Southwestern part of Phoenix/Avondale/Tolleson area, definitely try out Song Lynn!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to express how wonderful this place is. From the sweet serenading music to the consistently delicious entrees, especially the Pho,  and of course the most important part, the service! The service has not once let me down. Kudos to the hiring manager for the courteous servers and double kudos to them for making the experience pleasant each time. This isn't just the best Pho restaurants around but truly just one of the best restaurants period! Awesome job!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Very good service and it is super clean. I have had their pho and it is very tasty. I also had their banh mi which is what I recommend.  It is nice to have a pho place on the west side of Phoenix."}
{"text":"There is a good broth to backup the delicious pho, fresh ingredients, quality herbs, cute, clean space and quiet attentive service.  Hard to beat the happy hour selections and prices."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in the valley! Vegetarian spring rolls are legit too!! Not to mention the service is awesome!  we love our Song Lynn!"}
{"text":"I came in around in the afternoon Sunday.  Brought my two kids...6 and 8.  We ordered 3 appetizers and two noodle soups. We waited awhile to finally have service....waiter didn't greet us or pay any attention until I glared and waived him over to finally take our order and bring water.  My son was extremely thirsty.  And drank all his water quickly.   Waiter never came by to refill, clear our appetizer dishes, or ask how we were doing until we were done our meal.  The appetizers were good spring rolls and egg rolls.  However the pho soup was a little bland..didn't have the deep bone flavor I'm used to and meat was tough and chewy.  Oh well...probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I dropped in on this place on my way to a comedy show, we were running a bit late, but man they were fast.  It was also the first time I've seen a restaurant use a tablet to take an order (saving time writing it down and entering it later).  I also noticed they had call buttons for the servers, what a proactive and forward thinking concept, and the place is pretty small and would fall into the hole-in-the-wall category.  The food was great, the service was fast and professional.  It's on my list to return and a good place to bring my vegetarian friends!"}
{"text":"I don't always eat Pho but when I do, I go to SONG LYNN!!

I had Pho once in my life and it was in California, I have been looking for a good place here in AZ and this is my new favorite place!!! 

It was amazing!!!! I loved it!!!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. My best friend and I were driving around trying to find a pho restaurant that was open at like 9:15pm and we got desperate lol. I found this place was close by and open longer. So we got there and looked and quickly ordered. They were very quick. Within 5 minutes we had our dish. We both ordered number 9. Which if I remember correctly was medium rare and shredded. It was so moist and yummy. We were both impressed with how nice and how quick the service was. And the meal was awesome! Us being desperate turned into finding a good pho restaurant haha. I'm so glad we did. Him and I are both very picky on pho too. So this was good that we both liked it. And the plate with stuff to put in it, they actually gave one to each of us. One for him and one for me. Which was awesome cause we could put more than usual! So yummy."}
{"text":"What a great place! This is honestly some of the best Vietnamese I have had. Had lunch there today with a friend and it was excellent. We both had the Pho and it was very good with huge portions. I also tried one of the \"Sub Sandwiches and it was excellent! The Staff and owners were so friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We don't have a ton of winners in the west valley, but Song Lynn is a diamond in the rough. We love everything we have tried. I usually get the Filet Mignon with fried rice and the flavors are amazing! My husband like the dumpling pho, but honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with their menu. For takeout, they are wonderfully surprising!"}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese Restaurant... I love this place, they serve the best spring roll without the peanut butter sauce, pho and b6 salad.  Good customer service.  Specially great service from  Giang"}
{"text":"Great meal

I live in the area and have past by Song Lynn dozens of times but never stopped in . I love Vietnamese cuisine so I thought I would give Song Lynn a try. My only regret is why I didn't try Song Lynn sooner.

We were greeted and seated immediately. The staff was very friendly and our server was very knowledgeable of the entrees on the menu. Our entrees were served quickly and the portions very generous.

On this visit we had the Stir Fried Spicy Lemongrass Chicken with Rice, Pho, and eggrolls.  All of our entrees were very flavorful, authentic, and delicious. 

The prices are very reasonable and you will leave satisfied. Don't let the plain strip mall location fool you. We are happy we visited and will definitely come again."}
{"text":"(This review is from 2014) The beef pho is pretty good. It's the best-looking Vietnamese restaurant I've been too. The pork spring rolls have gotten worse I think lately. Maybe I just got a not so good batch. I've had other dishes. All good (especially the noodles) except for this one egg noodle dish I had it to-go. Maybe cause it was to-go that it was not good since I didn't have a plate/bowl to put it in. When you order to-go there they give you the dish components separate for you to put together on a plate/bowl yourself at home. I ate at a park. This place has good noodle dishes.

For better pho and spring rolls go to Central King Egg Roll (AKA Pho King Eggroll) in Goodyear."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I was looking forward to eating here with my family but the food was more expensive and lacked quality than other Vietnamese restaurants I frequent. No friendly greeters, egg rolls didn't come with fresh mint but instead wilted lettuce, I had three pieces of beef in my pho, no cilantro, overall it was pricey, less flavorful and skimpy on the vegetables. Not impressed at all, wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I've now been to this place 7 times.  The food gets 5 stars!  The decor gets 5 stars.  My problem?  You have music playing and the TV playing at the same time...It's a racket!  Pick one or the other.  My other problem with the TV, it's always on Fox News....REALLY?  In an Asian restaurant?  Isn't like like Chickens following Colonel Sanders?  Turn that divisive crap off and put something pleasant on for a dining experience."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service! The interior is decorated nicely too, and it was very clean. Good selection of food, including some vegetarian options. I had the chicken pho and my husband had the beef pho - both were delicious. The fried egg rolls (cha gio) are always my favorite and these didn't disappoint. Prices are very reasonable. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was there was a lack of veggies (used to wrap around) with the egg rolls and Bun Bo Hue is not a standard menu option - although it was a special item when we were there."}
{"text":"Love the Pho here!!! Friendly, clean and delicious!! The Singapore noodles are also amazing! Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!!! Super modern decor, and very fresh food! The staff is friendly and helpful. The Pho was delicious! The egg rolls were yummy. The BBQ beef sandwich was great:) I will
Definitely be coming back and making this my regular west side Pho place!"}
{"text":"Their pho is really lean . They are always so nice . Their lunch special are good and really affordable."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy, nice and clean and good service. I've been here a few times and I've always had good food and a good experience in general. It is weird because they close in the middle of the week but just check their hours before you go!"}
{"text":"Really good dumpling pho. The basil was limp and the bean sprouts were kinda brown in spots. Not as huge of a serving as you normally get for the same price at other restaurants. Theres an upcharge $2 for large (which is standard at other places). Fried eggrolls were ok. The seating here is kind of awkward if you dont like practically sharing a table with strangers. (Some tables you are literally table to table with other diners) not the best or worst experience."}
{"text":"Great Service With A Smile, Smaller Portions and Bigger Ticket For Soup....

The staff was 5 stars friendly and big smiles make you feel welcomed here. I was actually surprised at how much of a smile our waitress had for the entire time we were there. She seemed to greet everyone with a genuine warm personality and gentle niceness. 

I ordered the Pho and Donna got the Beef Stew and we both spent the $2 more for the XL bowls. The food arrived and we felt like the XL bowls were the size of regular bowls at most places. 

The Beef Stew was 4 stars of goodness...

The Pho was 3.8 stars of goodness...

All in all I just feel a bit odd when my bill is $28 after a small tip for water and 2 bowls of soup... It's just a bit carried away for price.... 

General rule of business is that you make more in volume sales at a lower price than higher prices but lower volume.

{"text":"Din for 2 and an infant; Sat afternoon.

Excellent Vietnamese stop! The bánh hi tôm & tht nng was delicious! Very fresh veggies and the fish sauce was well mixed. The h tiu bò kho was also really good!

They got our customized order right, which is a definitely plus. AC was working great. Service was very good and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"The Asian girl that works the register sucks!  I fucking hate her. I literally avoid this restaurant just to not interact with her. Some of the other asians that work there are snobby, like that other young man that sometimes works the register. Some are nice. Overall they will treat you differently if you are African or if African dissent(black). Fuck them."}
{"text":"They have the best customer service! The food is very good. The restaurant is clean. I'm glad there's a vietnamese restaurant near by my house that has the best tasting food."}
{"text":"One of better Vietnamese restaurants in west Phoenix. I come here whenever I'm in area.  I really like their Beef Stew served with either noodles or Vietnamese bread.  Also the Pho here is really good with decent sized serving.  The servers are always friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place with excellent hours! The food is good at Song Lynn and they are the only place I know of with Bun Cha Ha Noi. Song Lynn is a spotless place which I got to admit isn't very common in Vietnamese place. Staff is super friendly and I love it. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was sort of a last minute decision to stop in and dine here, but not one I regret. It was a pretty decent experience and reasonable prices.
Our server was extraordinarily kind. Bubbly and always near. The restaurant itself is very clean, modern, and looks new, though it doesn't scream Thai restaurant.
I ordered my favorite dish, Pad Tai.  It was good, but not great. They were generous with the chicken, but it was just a tad dry with a little too many onions in it. I also tried a strawberry boba tea, without the boba. It wasn't bad. Tasted like a strawberry daiquiri. 
I'd be willing to give this place another go."}
{"text":"Clean, semi-upscale, and family owned business in the West Valley. Great staff and great food at very reasonable prices!

Great place, I must say we were surprised how great it was. Growing up a little bit over a mile from this place, I would never have thought to find such a clean and semi-upscale establishment in a deep corner of a retail strip in West Phoenix.  The tables have a call button to get the servers attention and they use tablets to place orders.

Our server knew the menu well and I was glad to hear it was a family business that has been open for a year know.  This is a hidden gem and I wish them great success.  Everyone was friendly and several employees, possibly one of the owners, asked if everything was good.  We had the fried shrimp rolls, chicken dumplings, and pho.  The plating was very nice!

Great place and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's been so cold in the morning lately, I've been craving a warm pho noodle soup. 

Came here for late lunch after shopping, staff was very nice and friendly.

I ordered my usual pho special, added $2 for extra as I was hungry. I thought I was hungry but their large potion was huge, I was still full several hours later at dinner time. They add generous portion of meat, each piece is very good and tasty, perfect food after workout, not shopping.

I also tasted pork chop and their flavor was so good. I can't decide which one was better. I actually liked both equally. I didn't eat but fried rice looked very good too. I guess I need to come back here to try some more on the menu next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Who would've thunk it?  A seriously delicious Vietnamese restaurant in Maryvale?!?  

Well, it happened.

I work down the street and this is on my way home, I had been telling my bff that I wanted to try this place for quite a while.  I had worked in my classroom late on night last week and I wasn't in the mood to cook...so I stopped to get an order of pho to go...I am so glad I made the choice.

Savory broth, raw beef, fatty brisket.  An abundance of noodles and veggies and a slice of lime.  Hoisin and sriracha.  Spring rolls.  Just do yourself a favor and order them.  

Well, a week later and the bff and I were out and about on a rainy night.  What is better than a big bowl of pho on a rainy night?  Again, perfection.

Friendly and fast service is just the icing on the cake!

One word of warning...they're closed on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Great local Pho with vegetarian options! Awesome service, I just wish they were open on Wednesdays. V4 all the way!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS food!  I don't know much about Vietnamese food but this restaurant is just the place to try it out.  So far every dish I've had, I would order again. It's family owned, the staff are friendly and helpful.  I try to go there at last once a month."}
{"text":"FINALLY!! A REALLY GOOD **CLEAN** PHO SPOT!!!

I just moved to the area for the Cal-E-Fo-Nay-Yay and in the three months I've been here I've been in pursuit of a default Pho restaraunt. On the verge of giving up of what seemed to be a figment of my imagination, I found this place.... YAY!!!

The PHO was FANTASTIC! It came in a smaller bowl I was accustomed to but it was a optical illusion because it was a quite satisfactory amount.

The ambiance was more modern and clean. (Kind of reminded me of a quan nhau... hmmmm now I wonder... lol) 

Their primary server is a young bilingual latina, which I think is genius!!! I don't have to be confused if I'm ordering a orange juice or a manicure... But they of course they also have the traditional Vietnamese servers if that's your cup of tea who are also really nice and helpful. 

I'M SO GLAD FOUND THIS SPOT! AND IT'S NOW MY GO TO DEFAULT PHO PLACE! 

=)

NOOB TUTORIAL:

it's pronounced \"FUH\" not \"FOE\""}
{"text":"Huge portions and great tasting food. They have buttons in the booth to alert your server. 
Great place!"}
{"text":"Very delicious chicken pho, but I would like to see a little more chicken. Didn't seem like there was enough.  Staff were friendly and good prices.  Enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Place is great. Been coming here for a few years now and Everytime it is super clean. You can tell they keep investing back into their business because they pay attention to detail. My favorite place to come eat pho."}
{"text":"The food was ok I ordered Beef and brisket Pho and it easy good but I've had better.inside is nice and the price is good but I felt that my Pho had too much cinnamon. But I mean I'd eat here again just wouldn't be my first choice for Pho"}
{"text":"I come here for pho, so far every type has been very good,  so far Phó tai chin is my recommendation. My wife likes the chicken Phó but is not a person that likes Phó ordinarily."}
{"text":"The Pho broth was some of the best I've ever had. The portion was small for the price though"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.   Service is friendly and good.  Food is great.   There is a bit of a lunch rush and you have to go through their entire menu for the lunch specials but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Wait staff is always prompt, food is good and best of all they allow you to call ahead of time and order so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Though on the inside it  is looks like a small restaurant,  Song Lynn's food packs a big punch with a good Vietnamese  style of food with natural bold flavors and deliciousness with every bite! The restaurant was  clean and new. The service was attentive and nice.  The food was bought out quick for a table of eight and everyone was happy with what they ordered, truly making  it a new found gem for Vietnamese food to come to and visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent food delicious pho totally recommend this restaurant, clean and good service"}
{"text":"I normally order through Yelp for takeout- this is hands down the best place for Pho in the valley. Their broth is tasty and savory, without being overwhelming to the ingredients you put inside. They are very accommodating for takeout orders and package everything up for you that you might need. I'm a fan of their Well Done Brisket Pho, as well as their Vietnamese Coffee and their appetizer sandwich. 

The parking lot is small, so be prepared for that. It's tucked into the southeast corner of 91st Ave and Thomas Rd, next to SimonMed Imaging and behind the Starbucks. I love supporting local and these guys deserve your business."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with their food, not  so much with one of their customers.  The table behind me was so rude. There's this mother with her kids saying mean things about the place and the food. Her kids were so uneducated about difference between Chinese, or Vietnamese food, so ignorant about their waiter accent and she didn't say anything about it. Don't take your kids to a place and not discipline them, thats a total reflection to your parenting.  I don't go to Filibertos and mimic a Spanish accent."}
{"text":"Good food, casual enough to walk in wearing anything.  The software database on their pads to order seem to be inefficient though (which slows down the service).  Go here if you enjoy Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"On a roll with my reviews for my favorite pho places- this one takes a top spot. Nice, clean restaurant with delicious looking bowls of pho. Wow! 
Service was excellent, an older man came out with our soup and had a super friendly smile and seemed very happy that we were there. 
Pho of course was amazing!! Thai tea as well!! 
The server took our order on a tablet, and my order came out perfectly, just as I wanted!
Love this place! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All of their food is amazing!! You know its authentic when the menu is in a different language and you have to decide on your meal based off of the pictures. Quick service and really nice staff. I eat here about once a week thats how amazing they are."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Always really friendly staff. The food is always good. And I think the price is is good as well. Given McDonald's for 2 combo comes to 14-17 bucks. For that price. You can go to nice sit down here and eat something good."}
{"text":"THIS is the food that is SO delicious that you forget to take a photo until you've already dug into it! Haha.  

I have lived near this place and EVEN get my nails done right next door, for the past 3 years and I'm so disappointed in myself for this being the first time ever coming here. I've had it bookmarked, and even told people that we should go but never did...UNTIL NOW...I can't even put into words how impressed I was by this place. It's so clean and nicely decorated, the menus have pictures of the food, they serve pho AND the most amazing Thai Tea Boba!!!! My boyfriend and I couldn't stop talking about how much we are going to frequent this place from now on. The server was delightful and timely and everything tasted better than I even expected."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant...loved that the menu included pictures of every dish. Food was delicious and service was nice but not too over bearing. I gave a four star rating because we did wait quite a little for our check."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place and it was well worth it! The atmosphere was great. I'm not sure what play list they had going, but I loved every minute of it. And the food...that's the best part of the experience. It was fresh, delicious and fast. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. Like the environment. I wanted something new, different cheap. This was the perfect place. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and I love how customizable the dishes are. I wanted a small combination pho with clear glass noodles instead of rice noodles and I only wanted 1/2 the noodle portion (I never finish the noodles anyways).  And they happily accommodated and the pho tasted great!

Tried the garlic chicken wings also - they were really salty and greasy (What did I expect) - meh not for me. 

Coming from Socal where there's tons of Vietnamese restaurants, this one is on par with the rest of them."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho! Great to find a place that has great food in a location I travel often by. Had the rare beef brisket and the flat rice noodle combination.  Both were delicious and everything was fresh. Ambiance is relaxed, simple and modern. Enjoyed the meal and will come again!"}
{"text":"This was a beautiful reasturant and the staff was very polite. Food was delicious. Overall it was a great experience and there was almost no wait time when it came to ordering and picking up food on the spot. Everything was packed together very neatly and with care."}
{"text":"This place was alright as we were looking for something fast before the football game.  A friend had referred this place.  It's a good size establishment with plenty of seating.  Had their spring rolls which were light and airy.  The peanut based sauce was good, wish it had more taste though.
The entre ordered was some sort of meat and white rice.  Flavor was there, but the meat was tough, almost like chewing on shoe leather.  Service was OK... the people there didn't particularly seem like they wanted to be there, but it happens.

Glad I tried it for the sake of saying I've been there.  But won't be back..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff are always friendly and help you right away. I've never waited more then 10 mins for my food. The food always taste great and the place is always nice and clean. I definitely recommend this place and the P1"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! We have been coming here for years and the food never disappoints, the service is consistently friendly and very nice ambiance. Also, I'm Vietnamese and I'm picky w my bun bo hue and it's pretty good every time.. their pho is also on point.. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modern.  Very friendly staff. Family owned and ran. They are always helpful and suggestive. A lot to chose from on the menu, that's why questioning helps. Everything I have tried, has been delicious. If you have never tried Pho, this is the place to do so. Pick up is quick tio."}
{"text":"Pho was average \ on par, a little pricey for what you got. Egg rolls were a little stale, but not beyond the point that I was upset that I was served them.

Wife loved the dish she got (filet mignon), ambiance was nice, and the service was head and shoulders above most pho places. It's close to my house, so I can't complain. I wish the noodles were a little fresher and the broth a little more authentic, but pretty good for a local Phoenix spot."}
{"text":"Really good food and really good staff. They will bring out food as soon as it is ready, so sometimes other people get food much sooner than others but we expect that when we come here so it's not bad. All in all, I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We first ordered from here when we moved in 2 years ago and didn't want to leave the house while unpacking. Sadly, they don't delivery anymore....but I like their food enough to get off my lazy butt and go pick it up....so if I'm going to go I ways pick up a feast for us to spilt and eat off of all day. Our favorites are the spring rolls and the egg rolls to start. The dipping sauces are all very tasty. I'm not a huge fan of peanut sauce but theirs is pretty darn good. My favorite though is the slightly sweet but vinegary one that comes with the fried egg rolls (the one with shredded carrot floating in it) I like to dip everything in it...I could drink it!  Hubby always gets their Pho...I pass. It's certainly not bad...but not my favorite pho in the valley.  Instead I always gorge on the spicy chicken pad Thai. It's to die for! Love their noodles better than any pad Thai I've ever had. We also get a pork bahn mi. Bread is perfectly soft and chewy...perfect amount of mayo and fresh veg. Only complaint is sometimes the pork can be a little chewy. It's hit or miss but never been bad enough for me to not eat it. Overall it's a good joint for the west valley"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time with my fiancé. Gotta say we definitely were impressed. It was a very friendly and casual place, but with a modern look. We both ordered Pho, as well as the combination appetizer. Both were really great and was out in fair time. We went right at the peak of the dinner hour. It was fair priced, and definitely left us full. We are looking forward to our next return."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! We are upset it took us almost a year to find this place!! It's been a long time since I've said \"oh my gosh so good\" every minute while we were earth. I got the B1 which was an amazing combination included beef, shrimp, rice noodles, three sauces, mix veggies, and more. My husband got one of their many Pho offerings and was amazing! This very well might be our new favorite restaurant in Glendale!! (Cheap beer too!)"}
{"text":"Well me coming from La where Pho are like tacos everywhere the tendon in my soup needed to be cooked longer and soup temperature should of been hotter the spring rolls should of came with more lettuce not just 1 piece I know how to eat Pho and how it should be served. So this is why I will give the ratings I gave. I will give another try when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"If you haven't gone here, go! Delicious every time I go consistently. I love the meatball pho. Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for a couple years now. The restaurant is very clean and organized. The pho is pretty good, and the employees are very nice. We always get the fried rolls as an appetizer. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for tasty and hygienic Vietnamese food in the West valley."}
{"text":"So we have never been here before, wanted to try it. It's not a very big place but it's clean and nice inside. The staff are very friendly, the menu consist of lots of pictures with small descriptions which is helpful. We ordered spring rolls, they were good but obviously had been made in advance they were a little hard around the edges. My husband and I both ordered the dumpling pho but I had Pork he had beef... It was good, but nothing extraordinary, my kid ordered the shrimp fried rice which was good also. It's a tad more pricey than some of the places we usually go to but not by much.
Over all it was good, but honestly I'll stick to my other 2 spots."}
{"text":"Service was great, didn't really like the food I chose it was sweat. No matter shrimp fried rice was good , but ordered spice and it wasn't at all. The noodle dish ordered shrimp I got chicken. Had too send it back because I really don't like chicken."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food was lacking flavor. We had Pho and there was barely any flavor in the broth. Their tea with boba was really good, and the best thing I tried there."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time!!! Friendly fast service, never lets me down!!! I'm a big Vietnamese food junky and have tried many different places in the valley, song Lynn always has fresh vegetables and high quality meats that are tender seasoned and grilled perfectly!! Big thumbs up"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the largest menu I've seen in a while. We chose two of our favorites- beef stew and pho with rare beef and meatballs. This is the first place where they had beef stew with bread like we used to have in Washington. They were both very good. We will have to go there again and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"First time here just b/c there are other pho places closer to my house, I happened to be in the area and wanted to try it since I've gone to all the pho joints in the Valley I come across and I wasn't disappointed I always get the number 1 which is usually all the meats in XL bowl the broth tasted different from any other place It had more rich flavor to best describe it and yes like I've been reading the service is friendly here and the place is clean this might be my new favorite place to PHO. Will return."}
{"text":"Alright, alright...the second time gave me the charm that was necessary and much needed to place this Vietnamese establishment in my pocket of goodness to return to. The fresh spring shrimps and pork ,rolls, while not the best I have had, are not even on the my personal richter scale of dislike. My order was awesome,  food that came out quick and fresh. Customer service was awesome and price is great. Solid four and a half stars. 

Make the greens a little fresher and green in the rolls and this will be a five :) GO HERE, will not be disappointing to you."}
{"text":"Third time coming here in a week. Between me, my wife, brother and sister-in-law, we have tried at least 10 dishes and everything has been amazing. We've been lucky to have no wait and the food comes out fairly quickly. It will be a regular stop for us. We are very happy to have a really good Vietnamese restaurant nearby... and they deliver!"}
{"text":"I reeeeally want to like this place but after my fifth attempt it's just not going to happen. I know .. it took me five times. I wanted to make sure. 

The Pho broth itself is mediocre. Hardly any flavor making it necessary to overload on hoisin and sriracha. The brisket has a weird flavor to it. 

Second time I went there I wanted to try another dish. I got a pork Banh Mi and spicy lemongrass chicken. The banh mi was actually pretty good but definitely did not have enough meat. What was in there was about half a sandwich worth. The lemongrass chicken was also pretty good. The chicken was cut into tiny pieces and the lemongrass flavor was plentiful. I was getting my hopes up for this place! I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt and hoped the lack of flavor from my first visit might be the cook trying to find his/her place in a new setting. 

The third time I went I got the pork banh mi and the lemongrass chicken again.  The meat in the banh mi had a very scary flavor.  Tossed that immediately and dove into my chicken. Opened the container and it looked like a basic Chinese dish with big chunks of chicken and vegetables. And the flavor? Absolutely none. UGH Ok. Back to square one.

Fourth time, I got the beef banh mi and a shrimp and pork vermicelli dish. The banh mi was delicious.. All two pieces of meat at least. The shrimp in the vermicelli was soooo dry n overcooked.  Another disappointment.

Fifth and final attempt. One last chance because I'm hungry and craving Vietnamese food. I get a spicy beef with lemongrass and cha gio. The cha gio had little pieces of tendon? gristle? in it. Something with a hard popping texture. Not excited about that. The broth for the spicy beef with lemongrass had a strange unidentifiable smell to it. Totally turned me off. 

I think I went through a fair amount of the menu to give a fair rating. This place is just not happening for me. I will stick with 43rd Express or Dong A. THIS is where you need to be if you think this place is the  best. I think most of the five stars is for the \"cleanliness\" \"newness\" and not the actual food.  Shame."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place. H2 is great, with crispy wontons. A7 is a good appetizer - pork is better than chicken in my opinion but both are good. S3 is good, pan fried noodles. I think C7 is the best filet dish and it looks much better than the picture too!"}
{"text":"Came and ate here for the first time because my husband loves Vietnamese food. He said it was really authentic and delicious. We loved how we came 45 before closing and everything tasted fresh! Service was great waitress was really nice and attentive! We will be coming back often"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! 
Not only is the food great, but the staff is just as great. They're fast, they're polite, personable - top notch service at this place. 
Definitely try their chicken pho!"}
{"text":"First time in here. 

Great services, friendly, and fast.
The interior of the restaurant was nice and clean. 

I ordered the bbq pork sandwich and I like it. It tasted great and couldn't get enough till the last bite.

The pho was OK. There was something missing flavor in the soup. It didn't taste fresh and light. I believed it still authentic since part of their city have different style of flavors. 

The restroom was clean when I came in although they didn't have toilet-seat-cover. 

I would like to go back for their sandwich :) and also I will come back to try something else in the menu."}
{"text":"As I walked in, it smelt so delicious. Took awhile but after our waiter explained the delay, it was well worth it. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Love their lunch specials! I do take out and I can call on my way and its usally ready by the time I get there."}
{"text":"5 star all the way...great service..
The food was amazing..
C25 and A 2 love there coconut water so yummy.
I recommend this place.
Thank you."}
{"text":"By far the best Vietnamese food I have had! 

The employees are so friendly, and the environment is very inviting.

LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Beef Pho noodle soup was freshly made. Not a fan of poor quality of slices or cut of meat used in soup-- was supposed to be brisket. Shrimp wraps no pork with peanut sauce was excellent. Nice atmosphere. Cozy."}
{"text":"This place is really not the best. My gf ordered a combination fired rice, it was as tasteless as it gets. The really bad part was the meat was still cold (both chicken and shrimp). Needless to say, that was a disappointment. I'm seriously questioning those whose comments stated this is the best pho if they had actual pho before, because the pho here really wasn't that good. The broth wasn't hot enough to cook the meat on time, and the taste wasn't great. I honestly was not happy with the food provided and do not believe the price of the food was reasonable for its quality."}
{"text":"Really good pho recommend the pho chicken dumpling get the large bowl to split with other ppl and also the chicken pad Thai is good. Sometimes wait times are lengthy but good clean and nice"}
{"text":"I'm so lucky this place is right across the street from Banner Estrella. It really satisfies my Asian cravings during long hours of work. A lot of medical staff & docs order togo from this place for a quick meal during lunch/dinner break. 

The pho is pretty decent for AZ. It's not as outstanding as the pho in Cali, but I would recommend this place if you want some good pho in AZ. I usually get the pho tai, which is one of my favorites. If I don't feel like pho, I usually order egg noodle soup as an alternative - their broth is spot on. At times when I'm especially hungry, I'll add on the combination appetizer. The pork egg rolls are yummy! 

It's a little pricier than Pho Thanh on Camelback, but I think it's worth the drive. This place is way cleaner with great service."}
{"text":"Song Lynn, everyone here has always been nice and attentive. Excellent service & food is delicious.! Definitely my go-to Pho spot. My fave is the Tofu & Veggie Pho with chicken broth.. miracle soup for a hangover. Thai Tea is also amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place! All staff is so friendly and their service is always quick.
 I am never waiting long after I order!
My favorite things to order on a splurge day is the hot tea, chicken noodle soup and calamari!"}
{"text":"My husband and I would drive 45 miles round trip to go to a restaurant similar to this one because we couldn't find a good place.... UNTIL we stumbled across this gold gem! Their food is awesome, and to go orders take 10 to 15 mins if that. Their beef soup, and spring rolls are the only i usually order and it's on point every time. My husband has had the curry which he really liked as well! So glad we found this place, now we drive 8 miles round trip instead of 45."}
{"text":"Great new place with good Pho and Banh Mi.  Been here twice already with the wife.  The service is excellent and the decor is super nice and clean.  Great Vietnamese on the Westside now!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place..BEST Pho on the westside....always fresh, service is great and it's very cozy......our go to spot ALWAYS for great Pho"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in one night for a date and it's a very small place, clean, and service is AAAAMMAAAZZINNNGGG! Our waitress was GREAT! Their Thai tea is delicious, and their pho is delicious!"}
{"text":"The service is 5 stars, water glasses were always full and the food was brought out right away.

The food was meh.  The fried egg rolls were okay, a little too bland for my taste; and the lettuce served with them could have been fresher, they looked so lifeless.  My friend got the pork & shrimp spring rolls, but it was 95% rice noodle, 5% pork & 0% shrimp.  The pho was pretty bland, lacking the beefy/meaty flavor normally found in the soup.  Even with all the hoisin sauce that I put in, it was still so bland.  I would come back here, but only because it's near my friend's place. Hopefully, the rice dishes are better."}
{"text":"This place is great and to top it off it's on the west side two thumbs up. Clean place great service and good music. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"100% the best I have had. 

I called ahead to place an order for my lunch break, that way I can dine in without waiting for it to be ready first. 

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by name, and seated with my drink already there, within seconds my Veggie Pho and Veggie Spring Rolls (both vegan safe) were placed in front of me and I started immediately. 

The portion size of everything was perfect and filling, the Pho was not greasy and the spring rolls were huge. Everything was worth the price I paid.

This place was also so clean you could eat off the floor, and I really appreciated that.

The service was 10/10 my waitress didn't bother me but also attended to me in the perfect manner, they have a CALL button at your booth.. They know customer service here!

The only one Con would be that for \"Dine In\" it was just a little too quiet, maybe play some music or the TV louder or something, but that's a very minimal almost nit picky complaint.

This was my first time coming here and nothing makes me happier than a positive first time dining experience, I absolutely WILL be returning to this place and bringing friends. I work in Sales and I have ALREADY referred customers. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Our server was great! Loved that they had pictures for everything on their menu. It made it easier to choose our food (which was delicious). on top of all that, our food came out fast!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! We arrived less than 30min before they closed and they took us in with open arms, we didn't feel rushed at all. We ordered pho and it arrived quick. Pho was the best that we had in the valley. I will 100% come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here as we decided to come based off if yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. The Pho was delicious! We also had spring rolls which were huge with tasty peanut sauce. We couldn't eat it all, but took it to go. The place was relatively quiet, very clean, and service was nice. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced authentic Vietnamese food. Great shrimp rolls. We had the claypot combination bowl that was awesome. Staff was friendly, atmosphere was relaxing, definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!  We have loved absolutely everything we have tried here and recommend EVERYTHING!!   Great place with quick & attentive service - we have made this our \"go to\" Vietnamese place!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! Very clean.  Nice staff, very attentive, very good prices and food was so good!"}
{"text":"I went here with the wife and it was a great place.  I had the orange chicken with fried rice and it was very tasty and food portions were more than reasonable.  It is a small place which to me makes it better and the service was as good as you could expect.  The wife had chicken curry and she said it was the best she has ever had.  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite little spot. I promise you once a week I am ordering the P7!"}
{"text":"If you love pho and you live in the West Valley. Then this is where it's at! I always get the combination pho  bowl and it's loaded with goodness- steak, tendons and herbs.  You just got to check it out for yourself"}
{"text":"My parents came to visit so I decided to take them out for Sunday lunch. This place was closest to my house so we decided to go here. As I pulled up I remembered that I came here once and hated it. So I decided I will just order something diff but again the food tasted terrible

The spring rolls dipping sauce was spoiled and asked them to switch it out which they did and it was more fresh but they stand by that it wasn't spoiled, I'm not going to argue.

The pho is very sweet and I literally had 2 meat ball and a few tendons the rest was all noodles and broth.

I'm very surprised that they had such good reviews. I knew the moment I walked in and it was so quit on a sun 12 noon this looks bad. I wanted to go some place else but we were all hungry and thought to give them another try. 

I'm sorry to review this place so badly but I really dislike the food. The service was very pleasing tho. I'm sorry but we will never come back."}
{"text":"I'm not from Arizona & I'm Asian. I've had better broth elsewhere. I have yet to find one with a good deep DARK broth. Here, the soup is pretty clear/watered down. Their Thai tea and boba is good. It was hard to flag down our server for soy sauce. We asked for it and she forgot about it. 5 minutes later she remembered and brought it. I might be returning but I wouldn't give this pho restaurant 4 stars or more bc I don't think it deserves it. You will agree if you like your pho broth dark and more flavorful. This place isn't bad. It's just OK. I will be returning but I'm going to try something other than your pho."}
{"text":"Nice little find. Came for lunch with a party of 9, seated right away. Our server was very friendly. The restaurant is very simple and the food was very tasty. Our table was quickly full of dishes with Rice vermicelli, pho, pad Thai, and all were very satisfying. Very fairly priced. Would definitely come back! Some TLC to the decor and bathrooms and visible storage would have gotten 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"The Beef Stew has lots of flavor! If you want hot soup
In the winter in AZ and want something besides pho. Try the beef stew.

It comes with white rice noodles, carrots, big chunks of beef, and some tendon! 

Add a half spoon of chili oil to add some spice! 

The table even has a call button if you need something from the waitress, that's the first time I saw that.

FYI, the regular size bowls are smaller than the average size pho bowl. We ordered a large bowl that cost $2 more and when they brought out the bowl, it was the size of a \"average size\" bowl we get from our go to places."}
{"text":"always friendly, probably the best Vietnamese on the west side along with Little Saigon in Glendale. Always fresh!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Modern Vietnamese food and atmosphere, very good food.
Interesting method of calling the server over..a doorbell at every table.  a bit more expensive than Pho Thanh, but nicer atmosphere and better service."}
{"text":"A cute and nicely decorated restaurant hidden in the corner of a small shopping center across Starbucks. I ordered Hu Tieu soup which is an egg noodle soup with vegetables and pork, and it was very good. The staff was also very friendly and the environment is clean. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Meh.....I've had way better. I ordered the Pho Tai and eggrolls. The bowl of Pho was very small compared to other restaurants with a very small amount of rice noodles and meat! $7.25 for what should have been called a kids bowl. I never been to a Pho restaurant that was stingy with their rice noodles (which has to be one of the cheapest ingredients). I ate all my noodles within minutes and was still very hungry. The broth wasn't that great either. You can immediately tell just by looking if the broth is a good one and this one was a murky color with no richness to it. The spring rolls were really good, but they came with a few iceberg lettuce pieces, which were too small to use for wrapping  around my rolls. I won't return that's for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend got the lunch Pho and I got Orange Chicken and they were both delicious!!"}
{"text":"We lived in the East valley for 15+ years and went to the usual places over in that area. We have been in the West valley for 3mos and this is by far the best place in the Phoenix metro area. 

Awesome! We will be back for sure! Thank goodness for random food stops!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for try first time with a friend. Good ways good but the service was amazing. The young waitress was genuine and adorable. She deserves a raise."}
{"text":"I ordered the Buon Bo Hue (not sure of spelling) and spring rolls for take out. It was a busy Sunday night and all tables were full. The lady who took my order was very pleasant and friendly. Both were good but I've had tried many pho restaurants and I must place this under good. It wasn't so so, but it wasn't amazing. It was good and you will be content with service, food, and price. I suggest for others to try :) I must add that my current fave pho restaurant in Goodyear has a much more delicious broth, but, this place has much more meat in comparison."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. The food is really good. I especially loved the strawberry boba shake. Overall experience was an A+."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy their shrimp appetizers. Really great Pho bowls. I got hooked on the noodles and want to try all the different ones. Staff is helpful and attentive. Have never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Always treated with amazing service followed with the best Vietnamese food I've ever had. Love the S3 with chicken"}
{"text":"Great staff and service. Food was cooked to order and wonderful. The flavor pallet was fabulous. I love Vietnamese food and this place delivered on the flavor. Price is right and food quantity was right on."}
{"text":"One of the freshest Vietnamese restaurants. Everything is made to order just how. You want.
My office orders take out weekly, we have never had a problem or a incorrect order. 
I love the friendly staff.
Try the pho, all kinds are delightful!"}
{"text":"Love this place I probably come here too often! I like the P7
 Try it out! The food is cheap and delicious, it does get a little crowded some times but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Superb local Vietnamese restaurant. Recommend the Rice Vermicelli with Grilled Pork, Shrimp, Egg Rolls, Pork Sausage. Filled with fresh veggies, savory seafood and meat. The Pho combination beef soup was also well done. Friendly staff and fast service. A nice surprise was that their flatscreen had more than the local fare and had the game on cable I was just watching at home."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and came to say hi, the food was really good, they were busy but managed to get the food out quickly, also very clean environment, the only thing is I wished they implemented banh xeo but I would recommend this place!!!"}
