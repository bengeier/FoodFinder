{"text":"I have had both brunch and dinner and they were equally fantastic! Great vibe and tasty cocktails too :)"}
{"text":"Great decor, fabulous chef and friendly staff. We went there for dinner and I ordered the cod dish. It was cooked perfectly, delicately seasoned and complemented with subtly spiced veggie puree. The chef was very attentive and gracefully adapted my dish to remove any dairy without compromising the taste! My partner had the burger which was also seasoned to perfection with tasty veggies on the side. Service was exceptional. The best part is that after a full meal, we both felt relaxed, nourished and light, a testament to the quality of the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"popped in on Wed for dinner with kids and then had brunch on Sunday.  overall food was excellent. kids pasta was small but she loved it - had to order 2nd and she's 8 yrs old. service was ok , not great.  I had smoked duck w salad, which was also very small and totally delicious.  On Sunday everyone loved their brunch meals but service was terrible. 2 of us had coffee and were never offered a refill. when our meals arrived we asked to see cocktail list and waitress said they couldn't serve until 11. At quarter after 11 and after asking the bartender for a menu, she came by and says, so do you want a bar menu? um, yes! we hardly saw her the entire meal. hoping it was an off day for her because the food is amazing and if they work out these kinks it will be outstanding. highlights for brunch, I had point Reyers and eggs were perfectly poached, super yummy. low light for food would be over cooked potatoes and carrot juice \"ceasar\" with tequila."}
{"text":"Got a seat for lunch in the nick of time. A very popular place. Beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff. My husband ordered the chopped salad and thought it was delicious. I ordered the Ada's (vegan) and there was a mixup and I got the Aviva's instead. I didn't realize until after I took a bite. Anyway, I ate the side salad and when they realized the mistake, were very very apologetic. We couldn't stay to get a different dish as we were on a schedule. In the end, they comped our whole meal which I really appreciate as a class move. So while I can't comment on the deliciousness of the food myself, I can say there is a good vibe there with an interesting menu."}
{"text":"Loved it here! Great breakfast/brunch food, staff were very polite and the restaurant was bright and happy. Their menu is small but all the food is fresh, well presented and delicious. Glad to see another great restaurant open on the Danny."}
{"text":"3 or 4, 4 or 3? City Betty is really a 3.5 star place because it was ok-to-good. My wife and I got: - Sugar Shack Burger: The burger was nice, but really looked prettier than it tasted. The patty was cooked well (not over/under done, not overly greasy), but didn't really stand out flavour-wise. The celery root remoulade and dark cherry chutney were both great touches, though I thought there was too much celery and too little chutney for it to make a meaningful difference. The fries on the side were great - generously sliced, just the right amount of saltiness. - Big Sur: Open-faced French omelette which tasted like... any other omelette except the fillings are outside. I liked the celery they put (thought that was a bit unique) though didn't at all taste the buffalina cheese. The toast on the side was awesome - the bread tasted like brioche. - Donuts: The donut itself was executed well - good consistency and not overly baked. We got 2 flavours - ferrero rocher (generous helping of chocolate, though tasted mainly like a standard nutella donut) and cookies and cream (couldn't taste the cookie or cream that much as it was just a light dusting on the donut). - Coffee: It was drip coffee that was super bland. Not sure what beans they use...  So if the mains (burger, omelette) were just generally ok with some pops of \"good\" (side bread, fries), why not give a 3 instead of a 4 to show my 3.5 star rating? Because there was one last thing we ordered which swayed the whole meal: the side bacon. WOW. Thick cut,  perfectly seared, had the exact balance of the sweet-salty-smoky taste that bacon should have. City Betty was ok-to-good and really should be 3.5 stars. But since I can't give half stars, that thick, seared-to-perfection bacon just pushes it to 4. Mmmmmm...."}
{"text":"Went there on Mother's Day at 11.  The atmosphere was very welcoming and surprisingly wasn't that busy - but got busier while we were there.  We started with pineapple mimosas.  I had the omelette and my wife the latke - we split a side of thick cut bacon.  Each piece of bacon was 5mm thick at least and smoky and chewy.  The breakfast meals were also awesome.  Visit now before the word gets out!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in the old The Borough space. Went for weekend brunch and the food, decor and service was excellent! We got the Morning Blessings, Uptown Latke and Big Sur - great quality food and delicious. Some may find the food on the light side, but it was just right for us. Will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Great cozy place on Danforth. Came in on a Wednesday afternoon for a quick bite. Place was pretty busy but was able to get a high top table pretty quickly. I ordered the Aviva's morning which is a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese on a bun (although menu says English muffin), with a side salad.  It was pretty good and decently priced at $10. Great for lunch"}
{"text":"Our favorite new restaurant in the city! We have been to City Betty several times now (dinner, breakfast and brunch) and every time it has been excellent. Inventive, super fresh and beautifully presented food and cocktails, friendly and knowledgeable staff and a really cozy relaxing environment. A wonderful addition to Toronto's restaurant scene. Not sure if they take reservations, so get there early as there are lineups already (especially brunch)."}
{"text":"We saw a posting on blogTO for new restaurants in Toronto recently and decided to try this farm to table restaurant for brunch. The wait was 30 minutes as they only took reservations for tables 6 and larger. We were fine to wait and ended up browsing around the neighbourhood while waiting.  A few vegan options but generally egg based choices. I ordered the Benny and the Jets, which was an eggs Benny with rainbow trout and arugula salad. All their ingredients were fresh from Prince Edward County and I believe seafood was from NFLD. Ingredients were seasonal and nothing was from frozen and therefore they mentioned the menu is also seasonal. The trout was delicious and different from the usual salmon choice and bacon was available as an option. Two of my crew had the sugar shack burgers and were very impressed with the strong flavouring. The Point Reyes was 'good' according to my friend but she wished the salad was bigger. Service was at an average speed, but everyone was very friendly and water was always refilled.  Atmosphere was at the perfect noise level, good lighting and clean bathrooms. Would recommend this new up and coming business!"}
