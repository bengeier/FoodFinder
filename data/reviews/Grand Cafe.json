{"text":"actually incredibly surprised this is only three stars. i was just in vegas for two weekends in a row, both my stays were at the palace station and i'd stay again just to have this cafe at my easy access. during my two trips i was probably in the cafe over 10 times for meals, snacks, and late night hot chocolate. the servers are friendly and the restaurant is large and clean. they even helped my friend and i out with gluten free options. thanks so much! will return"}
{"text":"Very misleading. Their after 12am menu is only reserved for those who choose to dine in. BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"The grand cafe has been a hit and miss type place for me at the sunset station.I did not want to try it here but the buffet had a long line. Eggs Benedict was great! The poached eggs where really not that poached but It was good."}
{"text":"Food was ok, a bit overpriced, but it was in the casino. But the service took forever for coffee, over 20 minutes to get the bill after asking for it. stick with the basics, oatmeal, french toast, dont try anything fancy because they don't do it well."}
{"text":"I visit this location constantly when I get out of work in the very early hours of the morning. They have an amazing late dinner/early breakfast menu that has prices that are impossible to compete with. One server knows my order whenever he sees me and I love that kind of personal service. Some chefs are better than others however and the quality of the food varies from meal to meal but never really \"disappoints\". The best short stack in the world for $1.99 is unbeatable. Not to mention service is incredibly quick. The only night I've seen it otherwise was a holiday weekend when they were swamped by hotel guests. Understandable.  

This is a great place to eat if you're a visiting tourist or just with a group of friends late one night at Red Rock. Great for after a movie before you head home for the night."}
{"text":"Grand Cafe is a signature resto U will find at all Stations Casinos. But this one at Red Rock stands out from the rest is its upscale appeal. Don't forget to check out their baked goods counter after a satisfying meal at the GC."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous breakfast. Service and food wonderful. Almost did not go because of the poor reviews but glad I have it a try."}
{"text":"It's ok. If it's late and you want a place to eat, it's a good place to find some ok food."}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem! Friendly staff, inside of an excellent casino. If this casino was on the strip, it would be one of the top ones that you could go to, but it'd probably be 3x as expensive!

Highly recommended that you get the station card for the dinner deals."}
{"text":"It was in unbelievable how rude Rubin was. I live here and will never come back. Good luck to you who think this place will work for you after hours."}
{"text":"While you won't get pampered here, you will get excellent food at a great price. The potato crusted trout is well worth the short drive from the strip on Fridays. The other daily specials may be as good but I haven't tried them.

Like many casinos, they have great specials from midnight until 6 am to keep the all night gamblers going.

Every entree and all the salads are big enough for two, so think about sharing, or don't be shy about taking home half of it for later.

I think of this place as a high class Waffle House, which is a great compliment from a southerner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner after seeing that the line for the buffet was three miles long. We wanted burgers anyway, but LBS was packed and this place was relatively empty... seemed like a good choice.

We got the buffalo chicken wings as an appetizer and they were amazing, so everything was looking good. Then we got the burgers. 

I got the bleu cheese bacon burger, and my bf got the classic. To quote him; \"Wow, this is f*cking delicious.\" The burgers are VERY messy and gooey, so if you don't want your plate to look like a sea of condiments when you're done eating, then maybe this isn't the place for you. But I personally prefer that, and we left extremely happy.

Minus a star because the service was kind of slow and it took forever for us to get our appetizer. But the food was delicious. We'll be back. 

(Bonus points: they're open 24 hours... good if you are starving after a late movie, like I often am!)"}
{"text":"The food and ambience were great and relaxing.  The \"early mary\" Bloody Mary is phenomenal and they will happily make it to your level of preferred spiciness. The eggs Benedict ($11-ish) and salmon Benedict ($13-ish) were tasty, and the coffee is perfect, not too strong.  

Although the service of our sever left a little to be desired, the food runner was super friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our experience overall.  The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait time and the speed of service is maddening slow.  Always been the same issue that makes me reluctant to return.  I only came here because other restaurants were too busy.  Really wishing I could come more often but getting drinks takes 25 min.  They need to train better"}
{"text":"The food took forever to come....as well as the drinks , the bartender was asked 3 times if he could get started on making the drinks.  The drinks finally come and theres 0 alcohol in the drinks.  The food was very bland....no seasoning what so ever.  Not 1 person in my family finished their food which never happens I will not be back."}
{"text":"After long meetings I was able to come down and sit at the bar here. I had a few drinks and a great conversation with the wonderful bartender. My order was quick and delicious and the drink had the just the right touch of Vodka lol"}
{"text":"I ordered the wild berry waffle and a little green bug crawled out of my berries on to my plate! I doubt they washed the berries before giving then to me, I lost my appetite!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a cheap breakfast. The restaurant was more than half empty but waited about 15 minutes for 7 of us to be seated. The price of the food was great and the food was very good. However, the service was the worst we received in a 4 day span in Vegas. The staff in the restaurant made us feel as if we were interrupting them. Very very unfriendly and unprofessional. The server and the lady who worked the counter at the end is the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this cafe, the waiters were on the ball.  I received great service and the food was decent.  You do get a lot of food for what you pay.

The second time I went to this cafe, the service we received was a lot slower.  I could tell that the waiter we had was waiting on too many tables.  He did make an effort to bring us what we requested for as soon as he could.

The third time I went to this cafe was the worst experience ever.  The wait time to get seated was not bad; it was pretty fast.  It was the wait time for a waitress or waiter to get to us, that was horrible.  It took 10 minutes of waiting at our booth to order our drinks, and another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  After our drinks got delivered, the waitress just left our table.  After waiting for another 15 minutes and not getting service, we got up to talk to the person at the register to get our bill for the two beverages (coke and hot chocolate) we ordered.  (The hot chocolate had no taste and no one came back for me to tell them.)  She did tell us that we didn't have to pay for the beverages, but how she responded to us, was like it happens often. 

All the things we ordered here: artichoke and spinach dip (good), chowder (good), fried zucchini (great), club sandwich (tastes like a club from anywhere else, nothing spectacular), bbq bacon cheeseburger (good, huge portion), turkey dinner (good, huge portion), coke, hot chocolate (horrible, tasted like water that looked like hot chocolate)."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant.  There was a very short wait on a Wednesday night at dinner time.  The food was served hot and was very attractive.  The portions were huge enough for another meal tomorrow.  The fried chicken came with two fried chicken breasts."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab Breakfast before hiking in RRC. 

It was recommended by a few.  But turned out to be Nothing special

Lots went wrong. 
     Poached eggs cooked hard.  
     Pepsi products
     Slow service
     Inside a casino. (Very smokey)

My vote:  Skip it!!"}
{"text":"I gave them one star because I can't figure out how to not rate them at all. The service was terrible, they didn't even acknowledge our presence, and they took over 40 minutes making our food, and even then, they didn't let us know when our food would be out. We didn't even eat, and left upset and hungry."}
{"text":"I was attending the movies at Redrock and My Fiance and I decided to get something to eat here. We were seated and greeted by our waiter within 15 minutes Which was ok,  However the waiter was rude rude rude..I then asked for the Mgr. and he came over and was rude as well! This place has no customer service at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grand Cafe offered up the WORST SERVICE on Saturday, 2 FEB 2013. Avoid busser, Emma, waitress, Deborah, waiter, Francisco, cashier, Rebecca and ESPECIALLY AVOID cafe manager, Bobby.  These folks treated myself and my guests with disdain and disrespect.  Speaking with the Cafe manager will only make things worse as he is part of the problem."}
{"text":"The specials are great, but there is a small fine print at the restaurant that says you have to purchase a beverage.  And all beverages are over $4.  The burger is $4.99, but you have to get a $4 drink.  The billboards, don't say it, only the sign outside the restaurant, in very small print.  Anyways, it's not a big deal, but I hate marketing like this.  I rather you say $8.99 burger with fries and choice of any beverage.  I'm cool with that."}
{"text":"Me and some coworkers went there for lunch on Labor Day, the place was not at max capacity maybe half full. There was 6 of us so you would figure that they would try to help us out fast but no. Took 15 minutes to get a drink order, I had to flag down a waiter. The took another 10 minutes to get our food order, waitress who took our drink order left so fast that she didn't ask anything else. Food and shakes took forever to come back and some of it was cold. Taste was 6 out of 10"}
{"text":"Went here couple times. I had fried chicken and it was not yummy at all.. I did not finish my food and even throw up when I got home.. Last time I was there ! My shrimps were burnt and I can't even eat them because it hurt my mouth, its  too hard! I'm never eating here ever. Food took so long ...."}
{"text":"Located in the Red Rock Casino, the Grand Café is an upscale coffee shop. The folks are friendly, but the service is painfully slow.  if you're in a hurry go elsewhere. 

On the bright side, the food is fantastic and is a great value.  I have eaten there many times and I've always had a good meal. Most recently I ordered the prime rib. The hunk of meat was so large it could probably feed  four people.  I ordered the meat rare, and it was exactly what I got.  The meat was tender and juicy, I thoroughly enjoyed the small amount I was able to eat. It came with a baked potato and vegetables which I never touched.

My companion had breakfast at 10 PM and she said it was pretty adequate, it looked beautiful on the plate. Her main complaint was that the toast was not toasted, and the bacon could've been crispier. Her eggs were cooked perfectly. She ordered them soft scrambled, and they were perfect which is amazing if you have ever ordered soft scrambled eggs anywhere.  

They offer $10 or less specials every night of the week. As I stated before it's a good value stop in and have a bite, you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Summerlin there's not a lot of dining options, mostly chain restaurants. The Grand Cafe is one of the few places that is open late and close by. The food here is really overpriced but maybe that's because if you're a degenerate gambler you think you're getting a great deal. One time my Dad and I came in for an advertised special on their website and the staff there said that the special was was too popular so they stopped offering it until after the new year. This didn't make any sense at all. Isn't the point of having specials to get people into the door to gamble? My dad complained to Station Casinos and they said they would \"Do an investigation\" and get back to him. They never got back to him, never even offered him a voucher for free food, nothing. Maybe my father doesn't gamble enough for them to care.

Another time we went for the breakfast special and my father got food poisioning from the food, so he swore it off after that. My food was cold not to mention the awful quality of food there. There's hardly anybody in there when we've been there to eat, so that should tell ou something. It's just another one of those joints to churn out slop for the gamblers. If Station Casinos really cared about locals and not about locals money they would actually put some effort into having decent food."}
{"text":"I'm rating this a one star because of the the service. We got seated after a 15 minute wait and when we were finally seated, it took a server 20 mins to take our drink order.. We came at 2am for steak and eggs and it definitely wasn't busy. Our food took 45 minutes to be delivered.. The food was fine but the service as extremely slow."}
{"text":"The cafe itself is beautifully decorated....wish I had the same high praise for the food.  The salmon was bland, rice and broccoli. ..no flavor.  Plus the service was sub standard.  Our server was less than happy to be there...I used to enjoy stopping in for a bite, but doubt ill be back.  I still enjoy looking at the beautiful pastries in the bakery case."}
{"text":"Great little hidden treasure off the clutter of the Strip!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with 2 other people, about 2am after playing in the casino for about 4 hours. My sister in law said the had good prices on the \" late night\" menu. The cafe was nice, clean and comfy. Our waiter took forever to come over and when he did he wasn't very pleasant. Our order took forever. We all ordered the same thing with one having slight modifications. She asked for turkey bacon and cheese on her scrambled eggs. When our food finally showed up it looked disgusting. Everything was coated in grease, the bacon looked and tasted like it was deep fried and it looked and tasted like the eggs are made from powdered eggs. When my friend pointed out they forgot her cheese the waiter asked her if she wanted him to bring her some cheese out or have the cooks melt it on? Seriously... She sent it back with him but less then a minute later he was back with the cold cheese they sprinkled on top. She said she wasn't going to send it back for a second time because she didn't want anything extra too be in it... 

All in all I've read the reviews and I'm not the only one who thinks this place sucks... I'm from out of town, I come to GVR 3-4 times a year with my family that lives in town. Guess if your drunk you don't complain but you would think someone in marketing at GVR would be vigil at this social media thing and maybe want to fix the problem... Needless to say I'd rather starve then eat here again..."}
{"text":"I ate here every single day while I was staying at the Palace Station Hotel. The steaks are amazing, the chicken wings are outstanding, the service is incredible, everyone is so friendly. 

You can have breakfast at dinner time! and the restaurant is family-friendly which is not common in Sin City.

Se habla español!"}
{"text":"We ate at the cafe a simple breakfast I have never been thoroughly disgusted in my whole entire life I resent the fact that we spent $22 on breakfast and I couldn't eat it"}
{"text":"Slow as hell! Plenty of vacant booths and tables yet there was a wait? ?!?  Opted for take out which was and extra  $1.00 charge"}
{"text":"Stopped in after hiking at Red Rock. Food was a decent price for large portions. Ribs, burger, country fried steak were all excellent."}
{"text":"If you want to keep your dignity, don't even bother eating here. Also, don't even consider having a waiter take back your food. Unless that is if you want to be pointed at, or publicly humiliated by the classless staff. Call me crazy, but last time I checked, kale isn't supposed to be chewy and wilted. Also, did I mention flavorless? Considering the major attitude I was served, you would think this restaurant was on par with an establishment comparable to Ruth's Chris. Ps: you may need to call the exterminator."}
{"text":"Had the turkey bacon club with fries.  10 dollars was a little high but not too bad because the food was very good.  Service was awful, and it wasn't  busy at all.  But thats vegas for ya. Very nice interior with T.V.s everywhere to watch the game.  The midnight to 6am specials are the way to go 5 dollar half pound burger with fries. I will go back for there late night specials."}
{"text":"Just had my first horrible experience here, guess I should've read the prior reviews. I've  been here before and only had good experiences. We were going to go to the buffet, but the line was super long, so we tried the cafe. We were seated promptly and our orders were taken, and then we waited and waited and waited and waited some more. Then I noticed other parties that were seated after us happily eating away. Then I realized we had been waiting for 45 MIN for our food. It was not busy, they had plenty of servers on staff. We could've been in the buffet and eating by then. We looked for our server but she seemed to be avoiding us like the plague. I'm assuming our lack of food was some error on her part. So we got up and left STARVING. That was the worst customer service I've ever experienced. We will never go back there, lesson learned."}
{"text":"$5.99 for New York strip steak eggs the way you want them toast and hash browns $0.99 for the biscuits and gravy on the left its only on graveyard with your players card that they have lol oMG special.  

This is by far the best breakfast special in town right now with your players card they have specials such as a New York strip steak that was cooked to perfection I like mine medium rare and child on the outside the eggs were over easy the way that I like them fresh sourdough toast with jelly on the side and crispy hash browns but to top it off with the $0.99 gourmet biscuits and gravy n even had a little parsley on top to make it look beautiful"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely disgusting and the service was just awful. I will NEVER step foot into another Grand Cafe ever again."}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars!! But the one waitress I had named Rebecca was nice in the beginning then she became rude. She's a heavy set white lady w/ short blonde hair. It was New Year's Eve & I know that some stores & food places give out cute \"happy new year\" hats. I saw that she had one & I had asked her \"oh do you guys by chance have the hat with the feather?\" Bcs I wanted a new little head piece. & she looked at me like I was stupid & said \"no\" in thee BITCHIEST tone. I thought I was the only one who thought her tone was rude... But my boyfriend commented on her tone once she left & my mom even said \"why did she say it all snobby?\" Little things like that upset me bcs it's not like I was being rude to her in the first place. It was a simple question & I was expecting her to be polite. 

Also, in the beginning... It took her forever to even take our drink orders. she never checked on us to see if we were doing okay. She didn't check if we needed any refills on our drinks. She just handed us our check & left. I will not come back to this restaurant if she will be my server again."}
{"text":"Today was my second time going here and I absolutely love this cafe. The food was amazing and awesome portions. Our waitress, Tiffany, was wonderful. She was friendly, attentive, and fast. The other staff members were all friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"During a staycation at Redrock casino my friend, who is a big fan of Grand Cafe, and I stopped by for breakfast. This was my third time dining at the RedRock GC and it seems pretty consistent. Of course if you are lucky enough to be in Roberto's section, which I have been all 3 times, you experiences will be anything but ordinary. If you aren't having a good morning Roberto will make sure that changes and he'll definitely put a smile on your face.

As far as Grand Cafe food goes, they have a nice selection on their menu with many healthy options. The food always taste fresh and prepared nicely. Not much more you can say about a typical breakfast."}
{"text":"01/30/2016 
Early morning breakfast with my wife, I ordered a breakfast special w/ sourdough toast & eggs scrambled soft......Thank you for the wheat toast, and cold scrambled eggs that were hard as a rock. I really like the hotel/casino, but I will never eat at The Grand Café again!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but always extremely slow. It's a painstaking process eating here. From getting a table, to waiting for the waiter to waiting for the food everything takes forever. Last time I dined there the manager came up and offered me a free dessert to go because of the wait (I never complained about the wait for the food, the waiter complained to him) it took 15 minutes to get the free milkshake to go. How can they offer something to make up for the wait and then make you wait even longer hahaha I'd give it one star but the food is ok."}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl of soup and bread and butter. Was told I would be charged 4.99 for bread and butter.  Never heard of such a thing. Talked to the manager and his response was \" I don't make the rules.\" Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Vegas, I go here for breakfast at least once. I am glad Grand Cafe is back, Coco's was not very good.

I usually get the chicken fried steak, it is amazing and I always leave full and satisfied. 

The service can be lacking sometimes, but I am normally not in a hurry when I eat there."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there. Service is fine and leisurely.

oakmeal and bacon are good.

Stay away from the \"Classic French Toast\".  Undercooked stale bread."}
{"text":"Was seated very quick for a Saturday. Choose to sit outside.  Nice day but has a sour milk smell coming from somewhere.  Quick service good coffee.  I ordered the crab and avocado omelet my husband went with the chicken fried steAk.
My omelet was horrible but my husbands was great home made and not frozen.  will go back again and get the chicken fried steak"}
{"text":"IMO best place for brunch at Red Rock (I am not a buffet fan.)  We had a very nice brunch here with a large group (25 people).  They seated us outside, weather was perfect, and the server went out of his way to keep up with all of us."}
{"text":"Been going to this casino since it opened about 3 times a year.  Always have breakfast at the grand cafe.  The breakfasts have always been the best for a reasonable price.  We would occasionally have a burger at the grand cafe for dinner.  Excellent black Angus burgers.  We just returned from red rock and I am disappointed to say grand cafe no longer serves the yummy black Angus burgers.  The burgers are terrible now.  Breakfast was still pretty good but there are some small changes.  No more individual jam or hot sauce bottles.  I guess some big shot chef pitched ways to save money to corporate and of course corporate went for it.  You know profit over customer service.  We will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Red Rock for a few nights with the family and went for breakfast Saturday morning.  Since they offer breakfast 24 hrs a day you would think it would be better than it was.  

First off they were sooooo sloooow.  Obviously understaffed even with a line out the door.  If they had a few more people  they could turn the tables and keep the guests happy too...bit alas this was not their business model.

The food was not worth the wait.  Pancakes undercooked and flat.  Oatmeal bland and runny.  Sausage links no good.  Wife thought here breakfast burrito was ok.

Two stars because it was clean..  But that was the hilight.  Would not recommend ... Especially if you are in any kind of a hurry."}
{"text":"You know good food only takes a place so far, but good customer service and good food makes a great establishment, which this is not. Long story short; I took some friends to eat here, and the late night prices are unbeatable for the food. We get our food and all 5 of our hash browns orders are practically raw! I told the waiter who didn't show up until after we were finished (Jose P.) about the problem; he asked if I wanted fries!? 30 minutes after we finished eating you don't offer a person fries... talked to the manager on the night shift she really didn't seem to care either. So the next day we went to play some blackjack, and I told the dealer Suzie (Fantastic, she takes your money with grace) about what had happened, as I am a regular at the tables at least 2x weekly. She called her boss over and they gave me 40$ voucher for the cafe. We then saw the same inconsiderate manager the next night and I told her about the voucher, she told me I couldn't have given you a discount since it was already a discounted promotion! I paid money for something that wasn't even cooked, let alone cooked incorrectly. Is she nuts? This place has lost my business going forward, but I will continue to gamble at Green Valley that's for sure. Also I must say the cheese cake is damn good, it crumbles when you eat it, delectable! Just dont expect good service, or cooked food. They cater the Cheese cake thats why its good."}
{"text":"Everyone was really friendly.   Our good came out in a timely matter.  BUT...  my prime rib was REALLY tough! !  I offered my prime rib medium rare which the temp came out right.  It's just that u had the hardest time cutting it and the hardest time chewing it."}
{"text":"Another place on our \"List\" - NEVER to visit again.....

Have given this place many chances and it always lets us down.  Service is very poor, food quality is mediocre to poor.  We have tried many times to no avail.    From a burnt burger on a stale bun to a chicken croquette right our of the frozen food box with cold gel for gravy.  I did have a good Tuscan salad ONCE.  The next two times I ordered it, items were missing and I had to beg for more dressing.
The staff here is complacent, rude and act like they are doing you a BIG favor just by standing around.  They move at a snail's pace.  One exception is if you eat at the bar - there is one bartender that stands out on nights.  (Now, that WAS over a year ago-so not sure if he is still there.)
Management staff really sets the tone here and if you complain, forget about it!  We stayed away for over a year and decided to try it again.  While waiting (no line, not busy) for someone to seat us, I mentioned to the manager standing next to us that we always found the service slow, and had been away for over a year, chosing the food court over her restaurant.  She sharply said, \"Well, you came back didn't you?\"  I said, \"Yes, and now that I am here, I see nothing has changed, so why try again!\".  We promptly left.  Living nearby, we are often asked about restaurants in the area.  I have told well over 100 family, friends and, business associates to NEVER eat here.  One business associate staying there said she had no choice and tried it - she agreed it was one of the worst dining experiences she has had.

Don't be fooled by the decor, what is on the outside may be nice...beware of being drawn in!"}
{"text":"Third time here.  It's my go-to for breakfast here.  Kick-ass breakfast flavor, nice breakfast servers, pleasant environment, and prices are not going to kill you.  I had Huevos Rancheros, friend had Eggs Benedict, both were great."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while staying at the casino...Do not get the fish tacos. These were the worst fish tacos ever. They were entirely flavorless...I never use salt and pepper, but loaded up this time. Had to ask for some salsa, even though the plate came loaded with tortilla chips...waitress was nice enough, wait was not too long...but food was not even remotely good."}
{"text":"Probably the absolute worst food and service we've ever seen. This cafe has to be the worst in Las Vegas, the weasel looking manager needs to be slapped across his face. Never eat here you'll regret it %"}
{"text":"First time at the Hotel so we decided to eat in.
1. Cafe layout was nice. 

2. We where seated pretty quickly.

3. Food was great and the price was perfect. We had three steak and shrimp dishes. My son wanted pancakes. Steak was prepared just how I like it, shrimp was perfect, not too dry. The pancakes, I was surprised, great tasting pancakes. All of our meals where portioned appropriately. 

4. Service sucked. Needs more work. I ordered a cocktail, which almost never made it to the table. Our waiter was hard to find. Our food took to long to arrive. When we arrived at the café, it was not full. It was around 6:30p on a Sunday. They need more coaching on customer service. 

I would try it, but be ready to wait awhile."}
{"text":"After my first visit here I would have rated it 2 stars, but since my friend just had to visit Red Rock on Mothers Day, and with no other \"fast\" options, I ended up eating here again and quite amazingly had an even worse experience. 

I guess its no surprise that the Cafe was able to sit us quickly. 

The one star is for the nice hostess that had to attend to our needs 3 different times as our waiter who seemed to have all of 4 tables could not have managed to be less attentive.  

After getting our drinks fairly quickly we waited 10 more min for our waiter. I could swear he was reading off a script when he spoke to us. No smile, no real engagement, no patience and after taking our order we wouldn't see him again for 40 min when our meals arrived. 

After our food arrived he just left. We had to get the hostess to address the overcooked fries that looked like they had been sitting under a heat bulb for quite some time. 

We probably spent 20 min eating and during that time I only saw our waiter once who was looking down at the floor and disappeared into the kitchen before I was able to get his attention. Luckily the nice hostess was preparing some tables behind us. 

My prime rib was very dry, the fries were dried out, my Au Jus cup looked like half of it may have spilled out and of course I ran out. Overall our food experience was well below average especially for a place that tries to appeal to a slightly more discriminating crowd. 

If not for the poor service I probably would not have taken the time to even write a review. Cafe's are a dime a dozen and my food expectations are always low. 

Once again Red Rock fails to deliver. I used to love coming here but each new experience seems to diminish my motivation to return."}
{"text":"Gross food & average service. If you're looking for cheap it's a fine place but don't go expecting it get amazing food. It's usually busy so I don't blame the waiters for nit being the best but it would help a lot if they checked up more"}
{"text":"The food was good (not great) but the wait staff more than made up for it. They were quick, friendly and definitely went above and beyond! They even brought me a special treat when they found out it was my birthday. I expect them to do that for children, but not a middle aged woman :)"}
{"text":"I have a bad review about this place.1 it took 5mins for someone to sit me,i sat on the bar section,then the waiter took about 5mins to actually bring me my drink,as i was waiting to oder for my food and few more costumers came inn and sat in the same area,including a couple which i believe order some chicken tenders,i order their special of steak and shrimp,ok time started to go by first 5 minutes then 5 more until i realize that had been 22minutes so i ask a waiter for the manager and then about 2 mins more i ask a different also for the manager,then she came,she was an African American lady don't remember her name but i asked her what was taking so long,she replied:well it takes long to cook the food ,i told her that everyone around me was taking long to either order their food or get their food,she said well we are busy,to which i told her that half of the cafe was empty,i told her I couldn't wait any longer,i was really hungry and wanted my check,she said\"oh go ahead u can leave\" that is not the way to threat costumers specially when they waited long and didn't get a proper communication about what was going on with their food. Isn't the first time i had to wait at least 10mins but this time was just too long,bottom line be prepared for slow service and grumpy careless Staff."}

{"text":"Went for breakfast. I ordered sides of toast, bacon, & hash browns. Toast was burnt, hash browns were cold, and the bacon was soggy. My husband ordered breakfast sliders that were hot and good...It was as if the food came from 2 separate kitchens. We won't be back. Don't want to gamble on if breakfast will be good or not."}
{"text":"Been here several times for breakfast & have never been disappointed. Prices are reasonable & portions are large. I can't rate it for other meals of the day but I keep going back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I was here for dinner last night and enjoyed the service and meal. The burger was actually  \"well done\" as I requested, but not burnt. The servers were attentive withiut being overbearing. 
I'm here again this morning to try out their breakfast skillets!"}
{"text":"I have been taking my family and friends here for years. This evening was quite odd. The food is always very hearty and well priced. Wish I could say the same for the service. Usually, I would not even waste the time of day placing such a review, but if you're in the mood to ruin your appetite Robin is here to help!

I met my mother here, who made the biggest mistake of asking to make an order to-go. \"WE DONT DO THAT!\" is the answer we were provided by Robin. \"If you order food and I bring it to the table, you can put it in a to-go box yourself.\" These were the kind words that were given to my mom, who I might add just got off a shift working at the SAME property. As a red rock employee, you can expect my classy lady of a mother, to treat you with the best experience and utmost courtesy no matter how difficult you can be. Not with Robin, you can be smiling from ear to ear and she's sure to kill your vibe! 

The experience ruined our appetites and we ended up leaving pretty salty about the situation. My advice, ask if Robin is working the grave shift, and then ask to be seated with a different server."}
{"text":"We didn't even get seated before we had had enough of this awful service and gave up and left.

We waited in line for 5 or so minutes in front of the empty hostess stand before deciding to move up a little closer so that we could be seen.

Several staff members saw us waiting and didn't even bother to acknowledge us, much less let us know someone would be with us a shortly. After almost 15 minutes, and a line forming behind us of confused and impatient patrons. The hostess showed up, but not before stopping to chat with a co-worker right I front of us.

This woman was a miserable, grumpy old lady who promptly screeched out a rude, \"how many?\", But before we could answer she started scolding us about where we were standing, demanding, \"you need to MOVE.\" Extremely rude. We had no where to move as there was a swarm of people behind us.

I told her that there was no one standing at the hostess stand so we weren't sure where to stand to wait, she glares at me, and gets uncomfortably close before screeching at me, all while I'm holding my toddler, \" I REALLY NEED YOU TO MOVE.\" We decide at that moment that enough is enough and we turn to leave.

I muttered under my breath about how rude she was and she decides to then FOLLOW us out of the restaurant yelling, \"what did you say to me?\" \"Do you want to start something?!\"

Seriously folks, all while I'm holding a toddler.

We complained to the clueless manager, who apologized but, of course she did, what else can you do?

As you can tell from the other reviews, this is typical, and management doesn't care.

We will never be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after a visit to  Red Rock Canyon. The menu offered a wide selection, and I chose shrimp cocktail and a Tuscan chicken salad. Everything was delicious. Red Rock Casino is off the strip and on this weekday it was very quiet and I was able to relax after my desert experience.  I would definitely stop there again to catch a bite :)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the poor reviews! I experienced great service and good food. 
I ordered the 9.99 steak dinner(not on the menu)and I thought it was pretty good for 9.99. It's not a steakhouse steak but good enough. It came with a baked potato and veggies. Our server brought us bread baskets with softened butter....so yummy!
The service was great.
We also ordered spaghetti w meatballs and a cheeseburger with fries and we had no complaints.
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Upon consideration, the name of this restaurant is very fitting.  The pastry counter in front reminds you of a diner.  The vaulted ceilings, dark wood furnishings and crisply uniformed staff contrast with the menu which is just bread and butter cafe food.  The signs outside the casino used to advertise a $3.99 breakfast, but they stopped offering it the month before we visited at the end of June according to our waiter.  Without the shelter of a special, the prices are a little high for the caliber of meals served here ($10 - 11  per dish without including tip).  $10.49 for the shrimp cocktail.... whuuuuut???   

My family tried the burgers with and without fries, belgian waffle with eggs and bacon and I had the Mediterranean frittata with a dry whole wheat English muffin.  The staff were very polite and brought our orders out in short time, but nothing about the frittata thrilled me.  They bake it in a small skillet and serve feta, spinach and tomato slices on top with a scattering of some bitter tasting sprouts and an overly honeyed muffin.  If they hadn't fixed on coming here I would have preferred the food court or some tortellini en brodo from Terra Rossa.  It also pays to check the tab when you get it.  We got charged for some sliders we never ordered and my aunt, while she found the total on the high side, didn't notice the mistake until she happened to glance at it after her visit.  Summary:  Grand ambience, grand prices for pedestrian quality food."}
{"text":"Love PJ and Lauren at the bar.  The staff at the tables are excellent too.  I now consider myself a regular.  If it wasn't for the consistent excellent service & food, I wouldn't consistently come here over 5 years now.  The Spa Breakfast Platter is my usual, dad loves the Biscuits n Gravy and when the Chicken Cordon Bleu is a dinner special, it is the BEST.  The desserts are enclosed in glass and are fresh.  I even get my Breast Cancer awareness Donuts and other pastries for holidays there too!  Love it!  Will also post those!  Meaningful, mindful and delicious."}
{"text":"Can't beat the late night menu especially if you are a Station Casino Boarding Pass member."}
{"text":"Decided to try one of their new specials after catching a movie.. 
At first the server was borderline rude. But I think she saw my husband mouthing to me that she was a \"B\" so it got better after that.
I had the burger special. Now I have had their burgers before and this was not it. It tasted like a frozen patty that had just been warmed up. My husband had the steak special and it was so thin you could almost see though it.
I will go back but will order of of the regular menu next time"}
{"text":"Wow i dont know what happened to this place. The worst dining experience ive had in a long time. Orange juice  & cappuccinos took 15 minutes to come out and the capps were barely warm. Food took 25 minutes after drinks came out. 1 a la carte waffle, chix & waffle, breakfast sliders. Everything came out on hot plates with cold food. Butter wouldnt melt on cold waffles, slice of cheese on sliders was not melted, syrup was water, chix had that old smell. Sent food back and left. HORRIBLE NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"Server forgot about us. The eggs Benedict wasn't good at all and half of the banana fosters weren't cooked throughly. Oh and if you expect to come here spare yourself and hour to an hour and a half its a slow paced restaurant."}
{"text":"Cafe is open 24hrs and the food is better then fast food. Some menu items are a little pricey for the quality. If your hungry and close by its a decent standby place to eat. It not on the top of my list of place I enjoy eating. The food is just about as good as any standard casino cafe can get. Their taste is kinda bland and requires condiments and spices almost always. My overall experiences here have been good. The food usually comes out rather quickly and is what I ordered so no complaints here. If your looking for something that's a quick late night fix then this place will give it to you but if you have other options open I suggest trying those first."}
{"text":"The service here was great! Our waitress was kind, welcoming, and attentive. What didn't impress me was the food. 

I ordered a salad with light dressing. There was far too much dressing and despite being told the salads were huge, I was able to easily finish mine (as did others at my table). Neither the table nor salad came with bread and butter so there was no carbohydrate to fill the stomach.

The desserts in the case look amazing. Perhaps this would be a nice place for an after-movie dessert treat. Just pass the main course and go straight to the sweets."}
{"text":"We stayed at the palace station and came here for both breakfast, and a \"middle of the night, after partying\" meal. For breakfast the huevos rancheros were really good and the tequila sunrise was only $5. As for the middle of the night meal...holy moly!! The menu/prices were so cheap! Hubby got the skillet which was 2 eggs, hash browns and toast for $1.99! I got a burger with fries for $3.99. Service was good both times and the food was good too. I'd come back for sure"}
{"text":"Super Amazing and cheap dinners. A special always going on. The staff was very helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was either bland or overpowered with salt. Get ready for microwaved dinner. 

Mediocre service, food came late."}
{"text":"Very poor quality food. Tasteless. We had three different servers. First one took our drink order. Never came back. Second one got us drinks. Third one took our order. It was late, we were hungry."}
{"text":"Visited the grand cafe on June 9th at 11pm. Waitress was rude and needs to learn to smile. She was older with short dirty blonde hair and glasses. The section I sat in was to the left once you came in the restaurant. She gave me trouble when I asked to substitute hash browns for toast and didn't ask what I wanted to drink so she brought me a water. Wife had to send eggs Benedict back because the eggs were way over cooked, even though I specifically asked for lightly poached. She never even apologized. On the other hand, food was delicious once the chef corrected the mistake."}
{"text":"Grand cafe I had one of the worst experiences and maybe on the virge of being racist. I went at 2am to have breakfast and orders the bacon skilit which was 3.99. The waiter Doug took all of our orders. A hamburger meal a steak meal and mine. My friends got their food 10minutes before I did bland someone that ordered the same food as I later then me got their food first. I paid no mind to it because he said my food was coming. I finally got my food. After I was done eating I asked for the bill for me. Doug gave me the bill and it was wrong. It stated 6.99 I informed Doug that it was wrong. Doug took my card and charged 3 bacon skilits which was 16.18 cents. I was slowly getting frustrated because I have had to correct Doug at least 5 times tonight and I was being nothing but curtious to Doug. Instead of going to Doug at this time I went and spoke to Dina who did not know what dough was doing and even went to ask and Doug kind of blew her off. She then called the manager and uncharted my card and 're charged it for the right amount. I will not be going back to this place because of Doug and how he treats certain people. The last and final straw was after everything was corrected when I got back to my table Doug used some foul language as he passed me which made me want to jump down his throat for all that he had don that early morning. I will suggest never to go here in the early morning because services are horrible. Especially if you have Doug as your waiter. I will take my business somewhere else and I hope you will do the same."}

Has a vegan scramble and a veggie burger 


And this veggie burger is awesome.  I like the Baja burger vegan style.  Omnomnom"}
{"text":"We were actually hoping for the Buffet at Redrock Hotel but this was Easter Sunday and there was a 3 hour wait for the Buffet.... so we opted for here. The wait was about 30 mins or so....Once we were seated, we were offered Mimosas while we looked at the menu.....Name doesn't really fit, did't really see anything Grand about this place. Ok, back to the food. I had a prime rib sandwich, which was ok.....too much bread, not enough meat. I am trying to remember what my companions had, but I can't.....so I won't review theirs.......I just remember nobody was that happy about it.....ehhhh....next!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.. Really? Maybe they are short staffed I don't know but their customer service was a fail. Waited for a waiter to come by but no one came to acknowledge us. For nearly 25 min. A couple came after us and they got their order in. Even the table across from us was not even bussed. Nice restaurant but bad service."}
{"text":"Wow I haven't been to this place in a couple years and it has really gone down hill. It took them 15-20 minutes to bring us a water and we have been sitting her for about an hour with no food in site. My husband has been low on coffee this entire time and no one has come by to refill it. Even though it is busy in here this total lack of service is ridiculous. They have already brought over someone else's fold to our table. Maybe before the end of 2018 we will get our order ..:::"}
{"text":"Located in Red Rock casino. Came for breakfast as it was rumored to have great breakfast specials. We were seated immediately but weren't greeted by a server for at least 10 minutes :| (also it was around 8am and only a few tables seated). Once our server came by he was pleasant. I went with the $4 specials including 2 sausage links, scrambled eggs and 1 piece of toast. We also shared the French toast. For $4, I wasn't expecting much but I was NOT impressed. The scrambled eggs were soo runny - barf. The sausage was decent but super greasy and the toast was...toast. The French Toast was good! Should have just stuck with that. Probably would not return."}
{"text":"Went for late dinner. Ordered the pasta special with a salad, entrée and bread. I had the chicken parmesan. Service was quick and impersonal.  Food was less than mediocre. Bland, runny sauce and poor breading on the chicken. Only redeeming quality is the desserts. I got cheesecake to go and it was the best part of the meal. I would recommended not eating in and only ordering desserts to go."}
{"text":"I came here twice for breakfast during our stay at Red Rock. The first time wasn't so great, but the second time was a bit better so I rounded out this review to three stars in total. 

The first time we came here my family and I all met for breakfast. Fueling up for a day of gambling and fun. I wasn't really feeling breakfast. I'm not a breakfast person to begin with, but I thought it would be a good idea to eat something to help me get through the day. I spit the eggs Benedict with my Aunt. We also played five games of keno here, but unfortunately none of us won anything. We didn't have to wait long for breakfast and everything came at the same time. Everything on my plate was under seasoned and my hash browns turned out greasy and soggy. I still ate my breakfast though, but soon after I felt a bit sick to my stomach. Not a good breakfast. I was dreading coming back here tomorrow because I knew my family would want to. 

The next day we came back for breakfast. I didn't sleep well the night before and I had a headache. I was having trouble adjusting to the altitude change, my oxygen is low to start with so even going up a couple thousand feet messes me up. I did not order any breakfast because I didn't want to be disappointed. I just ordered a virgin Bloody Mary to help with my headache and wake me up. There was some confusion with ordering my drink though. Our server, or at least I thought he was my server told me to order my Bloody Mary through another person, but that person didn't come to our table. So everyone got their drinks, but me. It might of been because my drink had to be ordered through the bar and the first server didn't take bar orders which was kinda stupid. Once all of my family arrived for breakfast the person who I was supposed to put my drink order through finally came to take all of our orders. After waiting another few minutes I got my drink and I was happy. It was pretty thick and spicy, very substantial, just what I wanted. 

I had planned not to eat anything, but when the food came I changed my mind. My Aunt who I had split breakfast with the day before got her hash browns extra crispy this time and they were perfect. Make a note, if you order hash browns here get them extra crispy, otherwise they will be soggy and give you a stomach ache. I also got a couple pieces of bacon from here which were good too. My parents split the goat cheese, spinach and mushroom omelette, and a took a little piece of that. The goat cheese made that omelette. My Dad also thought he had ordered extra crispy hash browns and I heard him order it, but I guess the waitress forgot and gave him the yucky soggy ones. 

We played keno one last time. The keno guy recognized us and got us situated with our games right away. My Parents tipped him a $5 before the game even started, they said their last trip here they tipped the keno person before the game and they won, so they decided to try that out again. After watching and losing all my games last time, I tried a different tactic. I remember seeing a few numbers that got played quite often during the games so I played a couple of those along with some of my favorite numbers. I ended up winning around $30 this time. I guess it helps to tip the keno guy and to study the numbers. I was the big winner at my table. I think I understand why my family always likes to have breakfast here now."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the GF to grab some chow after not finding any at the pub.  Upon our arrival we were seated by the manager who was very friendly, he picked up the slack and came back and took our drink orders.  Then the server shows up, no meet and greet just a \"have you decided?\"  With a click of the pen he was off.  Thankfully this was the last we dealt of him, a new waitress took over.  The food was a-ok.  I had a Denver omelet and the GF had the Bananas Foster french toast with a side of bacon.  The french toast was cool in it's presentation but really wasn't all that.  The bacon came out in a dozen little pieces and was by no means fresh.  It's bacon and unless it's raw, it's gonna get eaten.  It's not the Grand Lux and it's not Denny's....just somewhere in the middle."}
{"text":"service was pretty decent, we were seated quickly but the food took awhile to arrive to the table. I ordered a grilled cheese which was pretty good but the side of hash browns tasted like olive oil. everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. overall pretty decent place"}
{"text":"You know the saying \"you get what you pay for\"?  Well, it applies to this place.  It is pretty cheap and the food is pretty bad.  Our server was very pleasant, however, which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Excellent prices for great tasting food. You get nice size portions for your money. I would definitely recommend this Restaraunt for anyone who is looking for a good meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I mean, I usually try to be optimistic but when the place is slow and you have to wait 5 minutes to be seated, then five minutes to place a drink order, another five Minutes to order and then wait a half hour for salads....this place sucks. It is for those who have more time, than patience.

Oh and the food is terrible...think Mimi's Cafe, but at Walmart."}
{"text":"Nice place to watch the game and Green Valley nice bar near little bit different than we do things at Sunset Station but it'll do"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that the hotel couldn't figure out how to transfer my call to the restaurant to order to go food, the food was way better than I expected. The cinnamon swirl pancakes were amazing and only $6.99."}
{"text":"Get breakfast!!! Bananas foster french toast was amazing! Great presentation and taste"}
{"text":"One of my worse dining experiences. I would expect more from The Red Rock being its one nicer Casinos under Station Casino's umbrella. The waiter wasn't rude just very over whelmed. We had to ask 4 times for Ketchup and Butter. The biscuits and gravy were cold so we informed who I to believe was the Manager, he promptly replaced our biscuits. Insisted that they were hot and cautioned us but they were only luke warm. Even the check was miss calculated we had to wait for the cashier to talk to the waiter to figure out why we were over charged. It was upsetting being I traveled out of my way to go there only be disappointed. To top it all of the next morning I woke up with stomach pains I believe it was that luke warm biscuit. I won't be going back ever. And until they get it together I suggest you avoid it too."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they have Prime Rib here for only $12.99. Thing is that it's served only 4-11pm. Bit its soooo worth it. Glad the Station casinos take care of me and my dad with the comps they offer. The servers are polite. And never slow."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Big portions. Price was affordable. Service was ok. 

However, the food took a long time to come out. The waitress was all over the place. I think they were understaffed. 

Pay at the front.

We bought some sweets from the glass counter. Cookies were good. We also bought the cinnamon buns, which the cashier raved about. We took it home to LA and my sis in law ate it so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Been here a few times after we hit the movies. Food is ok. Like their breakfast. Some tasty pancake and waffle toppings. Stopped by at 2pm for late lunch. Place almost empty. 40 minute wait for food.... Crab and avocado omelet was dry. Standard breakfast was ok... just ok. Eggs benedict average. Eat outside if you can. Really nice view of the pool area. its all about the view. Prices are about $9 a plate for the breakfast stuff. Thing I love about this place is the dessert area up front. They have the coolest little creations. Lemon meringue pies in the shape of little bee hives with marzipan bees. SO cool. If you don't eat at the cafe at least stop and grab a few treats."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at the Red Rock and we tried to get reservations at the two expensive restaurants.  We were actually able to get reservations at one of them, but while walking through the casino, we decided that the grand cafe looked pretty good.  It was nice inside and they had their menu out front and it looked really good!   So I cancelled the reservation I had and we went for it!  

I had the prime rib.  It was Vegas sized for sure!  Huge! Cooked to a perfect medium rare with tasty au jus sauce.  I got a loaded baked potato with it.  It was perfectly cooked. Soft.  Juicy. Melt in your mouth prime rib!  The baked potato was actually baked golden brown.  It came with butter, sour cream and chives.  There were also vegetables, but I was on vacation- so NO VEGETABLES!  But they were steamed and - you know....boring vegetables. 

My wife got the filet Mignon.  It came with a mushroom gravy and was very flavorful.  She got the roasted garlic mashed potatoes and was excited to find out that it came with a roasted tomato.   There were also some skinny asparagus on top of the mashed potatoes.  Good stuff.  She loved her meal.  

They had a dessert counter that was kind of on the way out.  The grand cafe didn't actually offer desert, because I think they want you to buy a dessert from the counter on the way out.   They did however bring me an espresso and added it on to my bill, so that was cool.  But kind of a drag that they didn't have dessert.  
 
This place didn't quite have the ambiance that the incredibly expensive restaurants had across the casino, but it was absolutely delicious and we spent a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"We had egg white fresh garden omelet and waffle today at Grand cafe inside Red Rock Casino. Probably the tasteless omelet I ever had, the chef obviously forgot to put seasoning. The egg was over cooked and the cheese wasn't completely melted. 
Nothing special about the waffle.  
Not to mention we waited more than 45 minutes for the food after we ordered. 
Probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"I actually like this place for the hours, the location, late night staff, and the salads only. I will visit again. 
Unlike the buffet your food is limited. That is a good thing on many occasions. Since Grand Cafe is 24 hr. (located within Red Rock hotel) limiting intake is good late at night. We had their salad. I like it just as much as I like CPK's salads, I was pleasantly surprised. I tried the Cobb on day 1 and the Mexican a few days later. All chopped and tossed with generous toppings (i.e. chicken). 
They also had a three for 9.99 special (confirm timing of specials on your own--we were there on the weekend at 11pm lol). Any way, this 9.99 special which, we did not order, includes an appetizer, entree of spaghetti and meatballs, and a dessert. 
The late night staff were friendly and attentive. I didn't have the same positive experience lunch a few days later, oh well. I would go again for the salads--you'll be surprised. Good portion size and reasonable price for the content and when you compare it to the comparable CPK or Sammy's salad.
 **Lastly, if you fill out the survey on your receipt you get $5 off your next visit.**"}
{"text":"Came here to eat after a fun night of gambling. Mo our server was so nice and funny! My friends and I ordered the sausage biscuits and gravy, a chili omelette, the short stack and two eggs, and the mac and cheese. We left stuffed with leftovers and the food was really good! Will definitely be back! The fact that it's 24 hours is obviously a bonus as well."}
{"text":"Horrible service this morning for breakfast! Ordered biscuits and gravy platter and requested tobacco sauce when it was brought out.Waited 5mins for it to come after I asked. Waiter forgot all about it so I couldn't wait and ate my food without it! Told the lady at the register, I don't know why they ask  how your meal was? I told her it sucked because it was not important for the waiter to remember the tobasco sauce I requested. Made sure not to tip... I hope he got the message!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast plates!
The reviews on this place aren't the best but I still enjoy it and if there's a long wait you can seat yourself right at the bar which has no wait time at all. It's actually a fun spot to chat with the bartenders who are always great and just enjoy your food. 
Breakfast is always great here with perfectly crispy bacon, hash browns, fresh eggs and toast that comes with whipped butter and a selection of jellies. I prefer strawberry & lay it on :)
The actual restaurant is very pretty with lots of nice details & yes it's always busy especially in the evenings. I always say that's a good sign. The service is good and I wouldn't say they are the fastest so don't come here if you're in a rush. I prefer to enjoy myself & take my time...
Overall it's a great place with a good traditional menu and the prices aren't too bad. I come here all the time to grab breakfast for dinner."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't think this place is all that great but I only went one time and perhaps I just hit it at the wrong time. I ordered a hamburger cooked to medium to go and it was well done - very well done. The fries were just ok which was unfortunate. It was an \"OK\" meal but not great. I'd only go back because there aren't a lot of options at this location but I wouldn't go back if I had more options."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite to eat and didn't feel like venturing too far from where we were. After texting friends where we were (they were gambling) they said they'd join us later but to go ahead and start without them. 

The restaurant wasn't busy when we walked in, in fact there was only 1 table occupied. This probably should've been a clue. I wasn't impressed with the food nor the service. It took awhile for anyone to realize we were waiting to be seated. There were no servers nor was anyone standing in the front. A server walked out of the kitchen area toward us, didn't greet us, probably did a mental head count and told us to follow her. She plucked the menus on the table and walked off. 

I wasn't impressed with my chicken Cobb salad. It tasted bitter. Don't know why and couldn't figure it out. The chicken was dry and not seasoned. On the plus side it had lots of avocado and I love avocado. I ended up picking through my salad and eating only the avocado. My friend had the prime rib and it looked pretty sorry and very unappetizing. He said it had mostly gristle, and had no flavor even after dumping the sauce on it. Maybe we came here on an off day. We ended up not finishing our meal.

Our waitress didn't check on us or ask us how our meal was. Overall the meal was meh and the service was blah. I guess they'd rather have you in the casino gambling than eating. While we were walking out, my friends had finally pried themselves away from gambling to join us. Sorry you guys missed the boat but that's probably a good thing.

Skip this place unless you're really desperate and dying of starvation."}
{"text":"We ate here both mornings of our stay at red rock resort. The dining area looks really nice but the food does not live up to the ambience. And the service is sooo slow. 
I got an omelette and the ham, peppers, and onion were gross...just flavorless and not fresh at all. The hash browns were standard and come with ketchup. My mom said her oatmeal was even bad."}
{"text":"If you're not in the mood for the buffet, this is another solid option when you're staying at Red Rock. Nice looking cafe with typical diner food; omelets, burgers, salads, steak & eggs, etc. It's in the $$ price range but you'll find good deals with your boarding pass, check the app before you go. There's also a full bar and you can play Keno at your table while you wait for your food to arrive. Score! 

Great service. My waitress gave suggestions when she noticed I wasn't familiar with the menu. Which was greatly appreciated. Lots of tempting desserts in the display case. I have to come back and try the cupcakes and macaroons. They looked delicious."}
{"text":"I will not be eating here again. I had ordered an appetizer, salad and coffee. The appetizer plate was never cleared from the table and my salad was drenched in dressing, but I was given a gallon of coffee. Awesome combo! 

The waiter was hardly attentive and I got more face time with the food runner. I could understand if they had been swamped, but every other booth and table was empty."}
{"text":"This place NEVER fails me!... Always good food great customer service people are always friendly and great attitude. And their bakery is awesome! I suggest people to Come and give it a try when in town prices are very fair."}
{"text":"I been going to grand cafe at Texas Station for a while now and its a great place to eat. This time i decided to go  Red Rock Grand Cafe . My food had no flavor. My waitress customer service was extremely poor. I will not recommend this place or go there to eat again."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we were seated quite quickly. The host did a great job with that.
But overall the service was extremely slow even though it wasn't crowded, and the food was terrible!!!!!!!

11:00 am seated our party of (6) consisting of (3) adults and (3) children

We quickly got our drink orders placed and fulfilled. It's a little confusing because your waitress doesn't take your drink orders, a separate person does this. So we never really got introduced to our waitress. She just came and took our orders.

11:07am placed our food orders

11:36am our food arrived.

The food had been sitting. Our fries were no longer warm, my soup was lukewarm and not hot. 

The kids grilled cheese was BARELY grilled... looked like 2 breads microwaved with cheese in the middle. Cheese wasn't melted.  Again, fries were cold.

The adult menu grilled cheese was better, but very oily.... and I'm MOST upset about the \"tomato soup\" that it came with, which was NOT a soup.. more like tomato flavored baby food.. even the texture was disgusting like straight up baby food from a can!!!! It was not a soup. It was a purée of some sort and didn't taste very well either. 

Everything just seemed undercooked, rushed, and cold.... yet took half an hour to come out of the kitchen?

Our waters were never ever refilled... we needed to call someone over to refill our water.

Service was overall terrible, EXTREMELY SLOW, and the waitress kept making excuses for everyone in the resultant.. \"oh sorry, the chef didn't know...\" like cmon get your sh*t together.

In the end, they didn't even charge us for our drinks and she tried to add it on afterwards but then changed her mind because I guess the kids drinks came with their meal included. 

I wouldn't recommend this place nor would I come back."}
{"text":"My brother and I ate here for breakfast.
It was only $2.99 for 2 eggs, 2 bacon, toast, and hashbrowns! Best deal in Vegas! 
Our waiter Michael was awesome too! He was very friendly and gave excellent customer service!
I would definitely visit this place for their $2.99 all day breakfast again!"}
{"text":"Some how for many holidays we end up here. We wait 15 minutes to get in and they were slammed today it being Christmas. Let me just say to some one there who gives a shit. Enrique is fucking fabulous. He was so sweet and was fixing the kitchens mistakes w poise. He was very thoughtful and smiling and even though it was so busy when our baby was crying it was basically drowned out by the hustle and bustle. We a had a really lovely meal. The food was great. The details were there as if it were Monday morning. Bravo to everyone who worked that shift and Enrique who at the end told us he just started 2 weeks before. So if anyone reads this and Enrique is your waiter. Be nice and give him a big tip. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends to catch up. They host a late night menu that begins at midnight with awesome choices and amazing prices. I like to go here with my family when they arrive from out of town, usually late."}
{"text":"This place has a great late night menu! The food is standard diner food but it's always good. The regular menu is super reasonable. Especially for a hotel near the strip.

Not so long ago they had a deal for $9.99 bottomless Stoli bloody Mary's.....jackpot.

The server Melody is fantastic. An absolute delight."}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've ever had in Vegas. The Chinese menu is surprisingly great.Reasonable pricing and open all night"}
{"text":"Every casino has a basic 24-hour diner. This is Red Rock's. Menu spans all-day bfast, salads, sandwiches and burgers (including an $8 classic), and dinner entrees- prime rib available daily, 4PM-11PM. Service is good (particularly at the bar), and they have a massive fresh dessert case. I tend to stick to the salads, omelets, and lighter entrees- the fish tacos in particular are surprisingly tasty, even if they're plated on a sea of tortilla chips. The meatloaf is also pretty good.

TIP: Sign up for the players card and check your mail for monthly $10 off $20 coupons."}
{"text":"The management is terrible here because the manager sucks. 
They don't need 3 host/cashiers while there is only 2 waiter, not to mention the white old lady with blond hair ALWAYS ALWAYS has attitude. 

HIRE More Waiter Please so we don't have to wait while there's plenty of empty tables available."}
{"text":"I ordered the nachos which I found a bit different from what I am use to. The cheese sauce was really gritty and the black olives tasted as they had been soaking in vinegar. I did like the black bean puree and the condiments that arrived with the plater. Husband ordered the American burger with French fries. He stated it was a little bland."}
{"text":"The food here is sub par, the service was kind of slow as there were only 4 tables other than mine. The waiter took about 10 minutes to take our order and our food came about 20 minutes later for a simple plate of steak and eggs. I had ordered mine medium rare and it arrived well done. Giving it 2 stars mainly because atleast the eggs and has brown were tasty."}
{"text":"OMG!! What happened to this place? We used to come here a lot and never had complaints. This time we did and even talking to people in the booth next to us also was VERY UNHAPPY!!
We were seated within 5 min of getting there. The café was kinda empty at 8:30am. After we were seated we waited about 15 min until the waiter finally came over and just started taking our order. I ordered the Red Rock BLTA and my husband got the three cheese omelet  with toast and hashbrowns. 
It still took forever for the waiter to come back to us with our drinks and never asked if we would like to have some water as well.
When we finally got our food which after the order was taken took about 30min. I got my sandwich with my fries in a metal little basket on my plate. I dumped my fries out on the plate and I had 1 little cup of ketchup to use for my sandwich and my fries!! I did like my sandwich. My husband said his omelet tasted like they put liquid not real cheese and his hashbrowns on the bottom were burned. The waiter never came to refill our drinks and we were done with them almost before our meal got to us. We were waiting for the ice to melt so we can drink something. 
Then we were ready to go and my husband kept trying to get the waiters attention. In which he ignored us. We waited 15 min for our check and never got it. We got up and walked up to the registers and voiced our frustration. The girl got our ticket and rang us up. Never apologizing for our bad service. NEVER again will we be back. Such a HUGE disappointment."}
{"text":"Lukewarm food.
Indifferent service.
Steak full of gristle.
Thank God we had a coupon and didn't pay full price.

Blechhh!"}
{"text":"Just not that grand. Almost empty, but hostess wants to seat us (two ) directly next to a full table. Grudgingly gives us a booth to ourselves. Waiter does not know for sure what beers are on tap. Goes to find out, returns and tells a different table. Returns to us, takes order for beer and glass of chianti. Returns, again after a long wait, to say out of the beer, no chianti. Takes entree and food orders. Long wait. Soup comes, too few crackers. Very short time, entrees are delivered, no more crackers even though requested. Spaghetti and meatballs barely edible. Street tacos quite mundane. Service still very slow. We declined to order dessert."}
{"text":"Came here randomly for lunch.
Let me just say that, this place is suuuuuper cheap!!!
And when I see cheap food, I try not to have high expectations.

To my surprise, it was good for the price that you pay!

Although I was sad that the prime rib is only served after 4pm.

So I had to resort to a second choice.

I got a patty melt with fries.
The bread was crispy and buttery.
The patty was not dry.
There was a good amount of cheese and onions.
The fries were good.

Service was great."}
{"text":"Do not come here after midnight.  Just like Cinderella's gown changing to rags at the stroke of midnight, this place goes through a similar metamorphosis.

We tried the breakfast here and that was okay.  Nothing good.  Nothing bad.

Then we tried this place later that night after too many pitchers of beer at their bowling alley (which is AWESOME) and a whole different story.
http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-lanes-las-vegas#hrid:eh2dzpEeZT-H8F_F373LYg

First, there's a line of people waiting to be seated in this empty restaurant while the staff is walking around aimlessly.  After waiting half an hour to be seated, you can see the same staff people still walking around aimlessly.  Food is decent once you get it.  But just try getting the check.  I'd have asked one of the wandering staff people but was afraid of the zombie look in their eyes.

Be afraid of this place.  If you stay too long, you may become one of staff folks walking around.

run yelp, run."}
{"text":"Ok place with a wide ranging menu.  Nice and relativey quiet given it is in a casino,"}
{"text":"So all I've really eaten here are the most basic things you can eat for breakfast. Bacon, eggs, sausage, toast and pancakes. I've also had their eggs benedict which wasnt very good. You can't really go wrong with the basic items. Pancakes were so so. They have a breakfast special for the basics 3.99 which you can't beat therefore upping their rating. Overall..not the best place to get food that excites the palate."}
{"text":"While the food and decor are great this restaurant lacks good service. Super slow, almost non existent. While our server was polite he was as slow as molasses in the winter. I suggest if you come here stay away from Anthony's section."}
{"text":"I used to like the 4 queens open faced Turkey but the cafe makes theirs taste second rate. The presentation is high quality too. Service is good. One of my favorite restaurant to go to. Right off the I-15 on Sahara at the Palace Station.

I do recommend park in the covered lot. Right from the elevator you can access the Starbucks, a gift shop and the Grand Cafe. Very nice place for the money. Not that expensive either. After all it is Las Vegas; very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer. Plus it has a security camera set up in all the levels."}
{"text":"Don't go for breakfast, the buffet is much better . . . and I don't even like buffets!!

We used to have breakfast here every morning we stayed at the Red Rock. Of the three times I ordered the fresh fruit plate, twice I received moldy grapes (on different trips, at least a few months apart). Also, by the time I would get fresh fruit, eggs, and coffee, it came out to be a very expensive breakfast. Then we tried the buffet at Red Rock. Now, I'm not one for buffets, however for breakfast this one can't be beat. For less than my fresh fruit & egg breakfast at the Grand Cafe, I was able to get all of the same stuff, plus smoked salmon and a few other extras. 

In summary, skip the Grand Cafe if you're looking for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Good deals totally worth the money on breakfast special 6.99 for 3  eggs 3 sausage, 3 bacon, hash browns, 1 biscuit and gravy and it includes your drink. As a local I love stations and would have loved to give 5 stars but not all grand cafes are created equal 3 of order exact plate with over medium eggs on was solid one had  watery whites the third was also over cooked, sausage and bacon over cooked we have had the same experience at GVR's grand cafe...sunset's grand cafe always gets it right with everything cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely great! Over the span of 3 days, my boyfriend and I ate there 3 times and our actual time spent at the palace was very little in comparison to what we spent on the strip. Carmen was our first waitress and she was the best! The food came out scorching hot and fresh each time we went. Our drinks were refreshed before we even could get halfway through. And the late night deal is way too good to pass up. Perfect for those late night drunchies! I tried many items on the menu and highly recommend the pancakes, Belgium waffle, (any breakfast item, really) and the burger."}
{"text":"Waitress Diane was super! The place is freezing.  All are complaining. The male manager Shane called us guys! Corrected him, but he remembered me from Sunset restaurants.  Told him he should set an example for his staff! SMDH!"}
{"text":"Thoy is so friendly!!! Great customer service every time I come here and the Eggs Benedict is wonderful! I get mine lightly poached with extra hollandaise. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stale fries.   Long lines.  You are better off at macdnalds"}
{"text":"This was absolutely disgusting! After waiting 45 minutes for our country ham steak and eggs and ground beef and eggs to be served, we tossed down our napkins, paid the bill and walked out!!! The ham steak was a ball of fat, the sour dough bread was stale and the butter was old, yuk. The ground beef patty was flavorless but the gravy was gross. Nine years we enjoyed breakfast at the Cafe but no more..."}
{"text":"Enrique was our server and I can't say enough how great of service he provided. He made the entire meal a joy and the food wasn't bad at all. Thanks Enrique for being such a nice person and great server!"}
{"text":"No food tastes good if they are cold when they are not supposed to be.  Twice I was served cold fries with a cold steak.  No there won't be a third time."}
{"text":"Pissed and disappointed. So there is a new manager named Thomas. Apparently this manager is too young to understand customer service to corporate clients or just regular customers. I have been coming here for several years and am a fan of chocolate cake. This cake pricing has remained somewhat constant until recently and the quality has changed as well. Thomas says corporate changed everything a week ago and no word on the change. However my gripe is that when I asked for this cake I was given it along with a price tag $2 more than normal. But get this...for 1/2 the cake. When I call to explain and question, Newbie Thomas gives me the old \"frat guy\" way of \"aww sorry about that awww yeeeaaahhhh oh yeahhhh\"! What the heck is that? I just paid for 2 cakes at nearly $5 a piece and for 1/2 of what is normally there and I get a \"ohhhh oops\"? I even ask about other substitutions including Cupcakes...since I am bringing these cakes someplace else for someone else to enjoy. Nope. No...we can comp one $3 cupcake or even $2 cookie. Nope! Well... If this is what Palace Station's new management is about, stay away!!! Trust me when I warn anyone about lack of customer service. No thanks! They can keep their midnight menu! Train Thomas to be more than a happy-go-lucky-and-flirtatious-dude with his coworkers complete with using cuss words in front of patrons and actually respect repeat business. Annoyed!"}
{"text":"Saturday night, around 630, it was pretty busy but we were seated towards the back and didn't have to wait which was good my sister had somewhere to be after.
We ended up here after not wanting to wait an hr and a half for pf changs or bjs and took an easier(quicker) option

Maybe the 3rd time ive been here? I still remember their gigantic bigger-than-the-plate hamsteak. But today i had a sore throat and chose the half sandwich and soup. Plain turkey on white... very uninspired i know its just a deli sandwich but any kind of house sauce or, anything would have been nice. But at least the turkey was piled up, the lettuce wasnt wilted and the tomato was fresh cut (it seemed) no fries so i dont know why they still plate it on a large... maybe put the soup bowl on there too or something, looked bad is all

I didnt expect a great chicken noodle soup since its just a cafe, but the damn thing wasnt even hot, very disappointing. Didnt send it back just ate it first and had to rely on the hot tea to sooth my throat.

Fried zucchini for appetizers were above par, not overcooked or soggy, and had some cheese cooked in which was a nice touch.

Menu was basic cafe, not as long as the rampart cafe, but enough to please our party from my soup/sandwich, to my sisters ny steak, dads meatloaf, moms chicken and girlfriends omelet.
Dad also liked that they had a Gordon Beirsch marzen available from the bar.

7-12 per plate, excusing the 18$ ny steak so the bill was only slightly higher than expected, 4$ beer, free water, no bread

Overall its acceptable for an easy quick meal while at red rock, but only if everything else is closed, youre on a budget, or dont like the food court. Given a choice though i prefer the Rampart Cafe, buffets are another story :P"}
{"text":"Our first night at the Red Rock we decided to eat a late dinner at the Grand Cafe. I wasn't expecting it to be anything too special since it is a 24-hour spot but man.....it was one of the worst dining experiences ever. It had NOTHING to do with the food which was overall decent but we had one of the worst servers in the world. I don't even know where to begin...

1. The wait was a little longer than I would have expected after 10pm.
2. When we were sat our server did not arrive for at least 15 minutes. All she could've done was stop by the table and say something like \"be with you gals in a minute\" aka table-touch.
3. When she finally arrived she had a tray with water and just took our orders. There was no intro or \"Hi, my name is...\". She almost looked \"irritated\" with us.
4. As we were placing our ordera my sister asked if she should order dessert now or if we were to do it later [since we ordered a pre-fixe-esque 3 course meal] and the server's response was \"you can either get the cheesecake or chocolate cake!\". Uhhhh that's not what we wanted to know.....we CAN read lady....
5. Our quesadilla and salad arrived shortly yet the 2 glasses of chardonnay we ordered had not arrived. When our server finally came around I was about to ask where our wines were but before I could say anything she said, \"WE DON'T HAVE SALSA\". I looked at her calmly and said, \"That's not what we wanted..we just want to know where our wine is.\" She then walks away and puts in our drink order. There was no apology or \"I'll get that right away\" from her. Thanks lady we've been waiting 15 minutes....
6. Our food took an eternity to arrive [~30 minutes] and when it had arrived my order was wrong. I told my sister to go ahead and eat up since she was hungry and I calmly waited for our server to come around so I could fix my order. 15 minutes passed and my sister was practically finished with her meal. I spotted my server and went up to let her know my order was wrong. When I walked up to her she just looked at me from the corners of her eyes and I told her, \"there was mayo on my sandwich\". She said she'd get me another.
7. You figure that if an order comes out wrong you would make it on the fly and get it out immediately. This was not the case. I waited an additional 15-20 minutes for my club sandwich and when it arrived she just set it in front of me and walked away. She immediately turned around and asked for our ketchup and I said, \"No. I'm using it\".
8. By this time I wasn't hungry and ate 1/4 of my sandwich and a few fries. I figured we should place our dessert orders now so we wouldn't have to wait 4 more hours for that to come out. Our server came by and we told her what we wanted. We also told her we wanted boxes for leftovers. 
9. Another 15-20 minutes pass and we see her walking back and forth but there was no sign of our desserts or boxes. My sister who was PISSED the entire meal [and whom I tried to stop from complaining] lost it and went to look for a manager. After a brief explanation of our dining experience the manager brought out our cakes and boxes in under 5 minutes. He apologized and gave us a discount which was unnecessary but appreciated. He was incredibly nice and accommodating. 
10. We just wanted to get out of there so we grabbed our leftovers and went to pay. While we walked up to the cashier our server stopped us and asked, \"how things were\" and then was like \"OH! I forgot to order your cakes\" and on top of that she looked at us like we were going to dine-n-dash. I ignored her the entire time and just said, \"everything was fine\" and walked away.
11. We left irritated and wasted so much time there. What a shitty way to start our trip. By the way we still tipped her which she did not deserve in any way. I should have just handed it to the busser who was working a lot harder than she was.

We've eaten at the other establishments in the hotel and received FANTASTIC service. We will probably visit the hotel again but if we ever come back to the Grand Cafe we will specifically ask to NOT be sat in that servers section."}
{"text":"Good food and service. But the speed of the food coming to the table is horrible. Also the quality of some of the items are less than desirable. For instance the milkshake is 90% milk, 10% chocolate syrup but no ice cream aka chocolate milk not a shake."}
{"text":"I expected better, I don't know why, I just did. The Grand Cafes at other Station casinos are tons better than the one at the Red Rock.

I had breakfast with my mom after we dropped my dad at the doctors.

To start off, they burnt our toast. I overheard our waiter even blatantly say, \"It's not the best toast I've made, but it's warm,\" and all I can think in my head is, \"If it's not \"best\" for you, what makes it good for the customer?\".

After our toast, we received our main meal and everything tasted extremely salty. I wouldn't recommend coming here again. Also to note, refills on drinks are not free; but that was our mistake for not checking.

The food here is not worth the price."}
{"text":"A great place for steak and eggs off the strip. Excellent selection and meals at great prices.  This place cant be beat. Give them a try."}
{"text":"My family of three were really craving some good burgers at a reasonable price and Grand Cafe's nachos (which are delish & great value). We were told they were out of nachos. It was a Saturday evening!! I've never eaten at a restaurant in Vegas that ran out of something (even smaller local joints). We ended up ordering the artichoke spinach dip. It was very good. However they literally cut up one pita bread and put it on our plate. After dipping one piece of pita in the dip at least three times to try to make the pita last, we ran out. We asked for more bread & they would have to charge for another pita bread. They wouldn't charge for chips but they were out. So, my son ate the rest (literally half of it left) with a spoon. We ordered burgers and fries with a side of gravy (a southern thing). The meat on the burgers is awful. No flavor! I ordered a blue cheese bacon burger. I could not taste any blue cheese at all! If you order blue cheese, that means you enjoy the flavor! Bacon was tasteless! How does that even happen!?! The bun was really the only good thing. Both my husband and I ended up dipping our burger in ketchup. We don't like ketchup on our burgers! I didn't want to complain because I had already complained about the lack of bread for the appetizer. I mean, this is a big, busy casino cafe! Running out of items and being stingy with the extras! Really? In Vegas? Don't order the country gravy if you are southern! It has no flavor of gravy, only some weird slightly sweet flavor. My poor son has gone to the bathroom 5 times since we left. I loved going to the place. It is so beautiful and the seating is great. Unfortunately, we will not go back!"}
{"text":"Food is not that good but you get what you pay for. For the low price, you won't starve but the tAste may never leave your mouth. Not the worst cheap deal in town."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the service was great. I love the aura of the place and the chandeliers of the cafe was so pretty. Definitely one of the few place i will be going back because of movie theaters and I ordered their specials and bought one of their huge cookies from the entrance. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there on 5/24/2016 around 6:30 pm 
Stood in line for 20 minutes while other patrons left discusted as many tables were open. Asked hostess if we could be seated and said no because not enough staff that night. We are elderly couple and Complained and finally seated in area where she said couldn't be seated as short staffed. Asked for manager and told him of situation. He reiterated line of no staff and that they would make customers stand in line before seating because it would take too long to be served. Said would much rather have slower service than have to wait in line. Said that's now how they do business. Basically indicated that that's our tough luck. We left unserved as did others in line had. We went next door to the Asian Noodle place and were immediately seated, ordered, only to then see the same manager and have him walk by us. He just smerked at us as if to say \"Gotcha\". Cannot say one thing good about this manager and condescending attitude. Horrible. This man needs serious attitude adjustment or job termination."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Grand Cafe inside of Red Rock for years now.  My absolute favorites would have to be the Tuscan Chicken salad and the Eggs Benedict.  The service is typically very good and even more so if you are a regular.  Pricing is similar to that of any other casino/hotel cafe.  I foresee many more visits to this spot due to its convenient location (from my work) and delicious food."}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant and go here often. This place is great for late-night breakfasts. They offer a delicious banana foster french toast. It is very easy to get into despite being in a casino. Great place"}
{"text":"Open 24/7 goes a long way in my book.

I love the fact that this place is always open and always available.  The menu is decent and offers a pretty wide selection.  I have the feeling that their best items are desserts and breakfast items as is the case with most 24 hour joints.

Decent decor and decent prices."}
{"text":"Only place I've been to that messes up your order twice. I have been coming here for years now and haven't had any major problems just a few mix ups here and there but this time was a little aggravating. I ordered a simple omelette and the order is messed up, no big deal. I send it back and the waitress was happy to make a new one and apologized which was good...BUT when my new omelette arrives it was messed up again! They had forgot some ingredients and the way they presented it looked like they threw it together recklessly. The hash-browns were soggy and drenched in oil and the omelette was dry and crumbled apart from the first stroke of the knife. All in all was a pretty frustrating experience."}
{"text":"I'm a meh here too - right now they've got a 3 course special starting at 9.99, so that was nice but the food was on the meh side.  My lemon grilled chicken portion was huge (a whole half smallish chicken), and the mashed potatoes are pure cream.  Service was friendly but really slow.  I'm not sure if I'd come back here if we were at Red Rock again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Grand Cafe for the first time in six months. We have not been there for awhile because it was a two star visit previously. I now give it one star because it it unbelievably worse now. They have deleted the specials menu and have a \"daily special\" with one item, Whoop de doo!!! My wife ordered the Pork Chops with country gravy and I ordered Eggs Benedict. I don't know what country this gravy came from but it certainly wasen't the US. Instead of grilled pork chops, they were breaded and deep fried. Yuk - really! Thin sliced,tough and tasteless. My wife ate about 10% of her order and stopped. The bartender offered to get her something else, but she declined. The Eggs Benedict were the absolute WORST I have ever had. Over cooked and burned Canadian Bacon and tasteless Bernaise (sp) sauce. We were there at 11:45 AM and the place was 20% full - no wonder. We sat at the counter and were the only ones there. We went to use our points and that will be the last time for sure. This is a shame since the food used to be pretty good. I don't know what their problem is but someone needs to fix it - quickly."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waiters/waitresses take a million years to get your drinks and to get your food, expect to be waiting 40+ mins when it's not that busy either. The food is also shitty. They never cook their meat the way you ask. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We use to go and dine hear a lot of times because they had almost the best prime dinner in town for a very reasonable price.  Well that all changed when something like a new manager took over and the service really went down the tube.  Waiting is part of the requirement to get in this place not because its crowded but because the service really sucks and are supper slow.  I've seen a lot of people go through the employment line to work here and it seems the requirement is slowness is a must.  We don't patron this place any more because it's not the \"Five Start Quality\" that it claims to be.  Service is extremely slow and the taste of the Prime is in the toilet.  Now we gotta find a new place to eat Prime.
The buffet is another example of \"losing it\" mentality.  Serving the same thing day in, day out, does not make for a good eatery.   In the meat section - steaks, prime, turkey for example are so dry you know you're in the dessert.  Italian-Not so good when the marinara sauce is so bland you don't want to eat.  Asia-same dish every time we go and not really good to look at.  Mexican - I have never tried this section because it sure doesn't look good.  Salad Bar is so scarce of veggies makes you not want to try it.  Its the smallest salad bar I've seen in a casino.  
Cost must be the big deal in here because it is all misered down tremendously.  Only real good thing here in the buffet is the workers - very friendly and courtesy. 
Noodle Shop-very pricey but they do have one of the best tasting Pad Thai eats in town.  Everything else is so costly, its like they want to break your bank and cause you to go bankrupt.
Gotta keep looking for some really good grinds."}
{"text":"This place is a little overpriced for its value. I've been here a couple times now, and the food is edible but not the best. Way overpriced for the taste. The french fries here are always really hard. More like potato chips then actual fries. The burger is ok, but really rough."}
{"text":"Grand cafes at the Station casinos are usually hit or miss, and this one is no exception. The service was good, however, the food was just ok...I had an omelette, which turned out alright, but the hash browns were absolutely tasteless. I guess for the price you can't really complain since everything is pretty reasonably priced. I think it was about 8 bucks for the omelette, hash browns and toast."}
{"text":"Service was great our waitress was Mona, the chicken fried steak was excellent, I lived in Texas for 10 years and I know what's good! I don't know what these yuppies here in summerlin are on with all these negative reviews because this place is worth trying."}
{"text":"After a night of gambling, the BF and I decided to grab a bite to eat. Decided to come to the Grand Cafe as it was about 1ish in the morning and the oyster bar line was still out the door and not many food places open.

As you walk up to the entrance, you're immediately drawn to the desert case (okay? Maybe I'm immediately drawn to it, lol;p) filled with donuts, cup cakes, pies and more. We waited a few minutes and immediately seated at the bar. 

The hostess handed us the menu, 3 different ones to choose from; a late night menu, simple breakfast and burger options which were really inexpensive, a Chinese menu and their regular menu. The gentleman took our drink orders shortly after we sat down as we looked through the menu. 

The restaurant wasn't too busy but 10 minutes in, it started filling up and it looked like their were only 3-4 waiters trying to get everyone settled in. 

A few minutes later, our waitress comes over to see if we had questions and to take our order. I ordered the Rueben Sandwich, Garlic Parmesan Fries and a bow of chicken noodle soup. My BF orders the fish and chips. 

My soup comes out first, and it was actually pretty good. I loved the chunky noodles and veggies but What I loved most about this soup was that they actually had lots of shredded Chicken. I mean come on, I had lots of chicken noodle soup but no chicken, lol!! 

Our entrees come out and they looked both very delicious. My Reuben wasn't too bad. What I liked was that they weren't stingy with the meat, lots of meat, and the sauce was good but I wish I had more. The bread was toasted on the top side and when I picked it up, the bottom side was soggy. Bummer! Which then made it a little harder for me eat because every thing was falling apart. Garlic fries weren't bad, but have I had better ones...sure I have. 

My BF's basket came with 4 pieces of fish and about 6 pieces of fries shrimp. I tried a piece and the fish seemed a little mushy for me. He also wasn't too happy about it either and ended up having more of my sandwich. 

As we were eating our meals, a delivery guy comes in with two stacks of boxes as tall as him. My BF and I sat there wondering, hmmm, what are those boxes? So we start naming off a bunch of things we think it is...so when we went to pay at the counter they had them on the counter and my boyfriend looks. He turns and says, Carl's Donuts?? I'm like what? Huh? No? So I look, and low and behold Carl's Donuts from downtown, score! We ended up getting 2 donut twist, chocolate Popper and a cheese danish. 

Twist, good! Chocolate Popper, good! Cheese Danish didn't even give it a chance. By the time we got to try it, it was hard. I don't think the we got were the fresh ones. 

Overall, staff was friendly but they seemed a little short handed that night. As for the food, I think that there are certain things that I will not be ordering, however, I have been here before and I know they do have better tasting menu items, so I'll stick to the ones I like."}
{"text":"The food was dry and bland. Ordered the ribs and there was no meat for it was overcooked and burnt. The chicken Ceasars salad had old chicken and the water had a weird sink taste."}
{"text":"Back at the Grand Cafe four years after my first review and sadly it falls below its original two stars. The entree salads could be considered retro but not in a good way. They are from 1975 with bland flavoring and an emphasis on low cost ingredients. The Thai peanut chicken salad in particular comes with tiny shreds of dry chicken buried in a massive mound of white cabbage. 

The service continues to be lackluster and inattentive -- the food did not come as ordered and came missing relatively important elements like the salad dressing. Nothing major but takes time and effort on our part to get fixed. 

It's a shame because we do like the Red Rock Hotel and now have to travel off site for casual meals."}
{"text":"Looking for some tasty sweets on a Friday night you found it here. They have an assortment of cupcakes, pastries, cookies, cakes, and more on displays, one can only try to resist, at around $2-3. They also have a tasty bananas foster french toast for $7.99 and some pretty good st. louis style BBQ ribs for $13.99 full rack and $8.99 half rack.

A real nice and well decorative place. You can dine at the bar area and watch tv or dine at the stylish sit down table area with giant chandelier lights over your heads.  Prices and quality are ok.

I had the $9.99 kings cut of prime rib, it was a nice size one, and came with a side of veggies which wasn't cooked long enough, and mash potatoes and gravy which was ok, you have the choice of rice or bake or mash potato. 

Also like that they have kona coffee instead of regular coffee. Always get friendly and excellent service. Plus they're open 24/7."}
{"text":"The Grand Cafe is located inside of the red rock. It can get busy on weekends. I've been here a bunch of times and the food is pretty descent. Denver Omelet , lox bagel last time were good. I would say the cream cheese that came out for me to spread on my bagel was cold so really hard to spread and the bagel was a little too toasty but I was hungry so I wasn't about to send it back. 

The server was very nice this last time. However it seems like there may be a management issue since the service at this place is always mediocre at best. We sat down and ordered a mimosa and waited for 25 minutes. Our food came at the same time as the mimosa which was not the servers fault. The bartender was not even be hind the bar 1 & 2 you should probably have more than one bartender helping if you have that many servers on the floor. 

The service always seems to lag but the food is good enough and I enjoy playing keno and going to the Red Rock."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Grand Cafe at Palace Station with my grandpa when I was a kid. This was over 20 years ago. It's inside the Casino and they have a individual seating bar that I remember like yesterday. They also have a keno girl that walks around to collect your bets (for ages 21 & older obviously) I used to watch my grandpa play all the time! I honestly wasn't expecting much. 

After eating here I must say I enjoyed the quality of my food better than some of the trendy breakfast spots around town.

Food 4 Stars - (I'll have to go again so I can give them another star)

I ordered the ham skillet. The quality of the Ham was the Real Deal Holyfield. It comes with 3 eggs any style. 
I ordered them over medium and they were on point like a Lazar. It also came with Sour Dough toast which was thick and fluffy and the Hash-browns were cooked just right. 

Service  5 Stars 
Our Server was great. Great attitude. The hostess who sat us right away was genuinely nice as well. Thank you"}
{"text":"Got up and left after waiting 15 min for the waiter ( Josef ) to come by our table. Disorganized restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered the walnut prawn shrimp 14.99 & Hong Kong Choe mein.

Depending on what you order, give the kitchen like 10 min. 

Wanted to go to Oyster Bar but the diner has a variety of food & customer service was good. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! This restaurant is poorly run. We arrived at 9:45ish and were immediately seated and our order taken...a simple order of two breakfast egg specials and a bagel. We waited and waited...it finally arrived at 10:35...and was wrong...no sourdough bread just white, eggs cooked the wrong way...scrambled instead of over-easy, and sausage instead of bacon.  I had to send the plate back. Also, the server disappeared and we had to flag down others to get basic service...like water. All of this was VERY FRUSTRATING! 
They were able to get the bagel right."}
{"text":"if you patronize the Station Casinos as much as we have, you know that virtually every one of them has a Grand Cafe location.  Because we live in Summerlin, our favorite go-to is the one at Red Rock Hotel and Casino, although the one at Palace Station is a pretty close tie. 

I can think of very few places where if you're in the mood for breakfast, and your other half/date/companion wants lunch or dinner, you can both have what you want at the same time. And at ANY time of day or night.  It might take a little extra waiting, but for the most part, thanks to the quality and the QUANTITY, it's usually worth it.

Take our most recent visit (July 6th). I hadn't been awake all that long, although it was about 3 in the afternoon.  We'd been running errands, and I hadn't eaten yet and was RAVENOUS.  I wanted something \"breakfast-y\", while Bear was more in the mood for dinner food. So I had a DIY omelette and French Toast with sausage patties on the side, while he opted for the lasagna. Usually with like items (everyone having the same kind of food), the wait can be about 15-20 minutes while you sip coffee and/or other drinks.  The waitress was very apologetic when we were headed for the thirty minute mark, and she explained that she was waiting on the lasagna.  We weren't in any particular hurry, so for us, it was no big deal. 

When the food finally came, it was all warm and fresh and as we hoped for, worth the wait. So if you're doing a show or a movie beforehand and you choose the Cafe, I would suggest budgeting your time wisely and accordingly, if you know what your show time is, and you want to be there promptly.  Otherwise, I'd say save your Grand Cafe visit until AFTER the event, or when you aren't in a huge hurry to get somewhere. 

Oh, and as others have already pointed out, their bakery case is REDONKULOUS.  I'm glad we skirted around it on the way out - otherwise, we would've ended up taking something home. (Maybe next time.)"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Hostess too busy chit chatting with the bakery counter to seat us.
Water came after we had to ask twice.  My my diet drink never came.  My order came out incorrect.  Geez.  Is the manager sleeping?  They have such bad reviews, don't they think they need to improve?"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles is the way to go. I'm a waffle fan and these get about 3.5 stars. It's the only breakfast dish I've tried that deserves a repeat performance. The edges of the waffle are a little crispy and the middle is a soft, slightly chewy texture. Do not bother trying the chicken sausage, not good. Very greasy and the texture is kind of gross. I don't know how else to describe it but I spit it in my napkin so I think gross about covers it. Just trust me and order the waffles.

I've had the southwest burger as well. It comes with green chili's, pepper jack cheese, guacamole and a pretty good chipotle mayo. I don't eat cow so I sub in a turkey burger. It's not the best turkey burger in Vegas but it'll do in a pinch. A little dry but it usually is in comparison to a beef patty.

The service is slow and very consistent. It's always slow. Always. I know this going in though so I don't sweat it. If you don't have some time to kill you might want to opt for the feast buffet here instead. The service is always polite and even with all of my substitutions and deletions, it's always accurate. It should be, considering it's slower than molasses."}
{"text":"Often times my family and I go to The Feast buffet whenever we are at Red Rock Resort but i think we may have just found another yummy place to go to via the Grand Cafe.

It was an early Sunday morning and unfortunately The Feast was not open today but luckily Grand Cafe was. This cafe is actually open 24 hours and I am so glad we found it because wow was this place pretty good.

Grand Cafe is a good name because they do go grand for breakfast! 

For my entree I got The Elivs waffle is a  Belgium  waffle topped with bananas, bacon, peanut butter and Nutella cream! This has got to be one of the best waffles I've ever had. Not only was it beautifully presented but it was delicious. It was savory due to the bits of bacon and sweet due to the bananas, peanut butter and Nutella. It was unique and so good.

The rest of the folks in my party got the Energy omelet. It's supposed to come with chicken,  egg whites, spinach, onions, mushroom and Hollandaise sauce.Unfortunately all three of the Energy omelets at our table lacked chicken. The chef forgot but the manager was nice enough to give a $2 discount per each plate lacking the chicken! I thought that was nice.

All of the breakfast specials come with either a bloody mary or a mimosa but for non-alcoholic drinkers, you can substitute coffee. This is what I did and I thought it was a great deal to have a $10 big entree with coffee.

I liked this place a lot and also was impressed with the various baked goods they had in the front. From giant cookies to pumpkin bars, I was so tempted to get one. Alas that will have to be saved for another day."}
{"text":"Four of us had breakfast here on Friday 1/20/17. The over easy eggs were runny and tasteless, the breakfast burrito was dry with very little flavor. Even the coffee was mediocre at best. A $50 breakfast ticket for a meal less enjoyable than a breakfast Mac."}
{"text":"We just ate here and there wasn't anyone in the place eating. That should have given me a clue they are worse then before. Prime Rib tough and Au Jus like water. The hot turkey sandwich was just horrible as well!!!!!!!!!! We will never go back and I am surprised that Stations Casino doesn't care the food is so bad. I also would never gamble here again!!"}
{"text":"There was no refill. Server was distant and innattentive. Food was burned and when we asked to address an issue we waited for 30 minutes before we left because no one came manager was too busy standing at the bar."}
{"text":"Almost 70 years old and the very 1st time I ever sent food back! Eggs Benedict! The muffins were not cooked, the ham was thin enough to read a newspaper through and the sauce was not anything close to being acceptable. It was clear and tasteless! I will say the eggs were properly prepared.

{"text":"I've ordered several times from Grand Cafe. This last time I drew the line. I always get to go orders and I ordered as normal a burger and a brownie. She puts in a BLTA sandwich with no brownie and wants to swipe my card again for a whole other amount. I said \"no, I'm not being charged twice again. Just give me the sandwich. So Rebecca, the server, starts going on about how the sandwich won't have any bacon. Why in the hell would I want a BLT sandwich with just lettuce and tomato? Oh that's right this isn't even the order I gave to you nor was it the order I repeated back. The manager comes over to be rude as hell. I'm cool on eating there especially when I'm treated as if I messed something up when I literally gave my order, paid, and Rebecca messed it up on her side by not simply paying attention to what she was doing.  I just cancelled my order so I have yet another charge from your establishment on my card that I have to have removed if your \"void\" never happens, which is a hassle.  I've dealt with mischargings from your food establishment 3x already! Once a server added a $15.00 tip to my $25.00 to go order and I had to call that in. I'm randomly charged a $2.50 service fee depending on.... I'm not really sure what determines why I'm sometimes charged the fee and sometimes not. The customer service at The Grand Cafe sucks. Please look at what you are doing at the register before swiping someone's card!!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices and super nice staff! Good for those late night grubbers, too!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, you have so many great food choices.  This isn't one of them.  Having said that, it's a basic casino coffee shop.  Opened 24 hours inside the Palace Station, the prices are of good value and even the food is good, but not memorable.  The late night specials offer the best values.  The wait to get a table and service is long.  I only come here if staying in the hotel and after midnight since other options are not available."}
{"text":"This is the place for comfort food any time but maybe my stomach is just too sensitive these days.  The service is great, the food is good and prices are reasonable but I'm just not used to big humongous portions anymore.  We checked in late night and I ordered the prime rib dip so yummy and I ate most of it with fries.  Hard to be good and healthy here but it was tasty.  As far as breakfast the next day, the corned beef hash skillet had a hefty portion but a little on the greasy side for my taste."}
{"text":"This place was just OK all most like a fast food of cafés. To start with they had a specials menu on the table but you couldn't order off it unless you had a players club card. What's the point in offering this menu late night if it has restrictions.  I ended up ordering a burger that was OK, it was almost like a old fashioned A&W burger. The fries were a little odd I  taste and came in some weird metal basket that was placed on the plate. My wife had nachos that were unlike any I have ever had. The best thing was the chips, as for the rest it was some kind of frankingstine creation of bean paste and other things that couldn't be determined.  They were all rather one note of gritty bean past and nothing else.  The service was the only bright spot here."}
{"text":"We were hungry and this was the only place open.  I got the chicken fried steak and eggs.  It was just okay.  Good late nite option, but don't expect anything stellar."}
{"text":"My sis had comps for the AYCE Grand Cafe (buffet) over at Palace Station.

We arrived a little after breakfast and just before lunch. I guess this is what those clever folks call..brunch. I'm not a frequent buffet person, but felt like this was the best time to show up; It seemed as if they had just transitioned from breakfast and had started lunch with plenty of fresh food being placed in the buffet area.

There were high's, and of course there were lows. The low's.. which I'll bang out right away were the pizza, hot dogs and chicken. All looked like food that has been sitting underneath a heat lamp for a full day. Cardboard like pizza, hot dogs are in water and the chicken was mixed.. good and bad pieces all in one tray. 

Aside from that, they had a nice selection of foods ranging from fresh salads, fresh fruits, burgers, egg rolls, dumplings, orange chicken, honey baked ham, turkey, sausage and so on. 

The highlights after digging through quite a bit of food had to be the honey baked ham (sweet, moist n' tender), sausage (juicy, salty and a little fatty), mashed potatoes (buttered, salted and smooth texture) stuffing (it was stuffing so..) and buttered corn. They have a chef right behind this counter ready to slice and dice you up some meat. 

The dessert area isn't necessarily my thing.. but they had bun cakes, bread pudding, chocolate brownies, cookies and more. I grabbed a simple soft serve vanilla cone which was a nice topper.

Although nothing was truly out of this world, for a buffet, this free meal filled me up and most of what I ate was fresh and had flavor.  Grand Cafe came through."}
{"text":"Is this a 4 star, take-your-partner-to-anniversary-dinner spot? No. It's a cafe at a Vegas hotel. The food was decent, edible & we had no complaints.

I got a steak & shrimp for 9.99, the kids got hamburger and French fries for 3.99, and my babe got prime rib for like 14.99. We had been driving for a while, it was late, and we were hungry. No complaints about the food, it's not a high end restaurant so we didn't expect much. 

The reason for the high review is mainly for our awesome waitress. Apparently someone complained to her about me breastfeeding. For the record my baby was even in a carrier, grow up people. Well our waitress came over, made a point to tell me someone said something and if they say anything to me, to tell her and she will say something, she apologized for them, and later even brought my kids some desserts because she felt bad. Come to find out it was the lady next to us.

Her customer service alone was awesome, I really wish I just had her name. (White lady, shorter hair I think, maybe in her 40s). Thank you whoever you are!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty great Reuben here the other day. I hadn't been in a while, but I feel my criticism of the slow service/high prices remains a problem. But the Reuben was really good, so there is that."}
{"text":"Right off the bat i gotta say... the service is GREAT. My complaint is no reflection on the server. It's purely about the kitchen. 

I ordered the New York steak. It was one of the worst pieces of meat I've ever tasted. Totally dry, zero flavor. It was not seasoned or marinated. I ate a quarter of it just trying to satisfy my hunger, but just could not eat any more. 

The server was very accommodating and removed the charge from our bill. But it's more depressing to have flavorless food. Its not about the money. It's the lack of flavor when your excited for steak. 

Will definitely skip this place next time we're at Red Rock."}
{"text":"in addition to my vip weekend stay at red rock. my friends and i ate here. i ordered the grilled salmon. it came with veggies and jasmine rice. i absolutely loooooved how they prepare the salmon, wasn't too dry and just the right amount of seasoning. i wish i substituted my rice for mashed potatoes! but next time i will =)"}
{"text":"Bringing back the old school Vegas specials. Coffee shop inside the Red Rock Casino with very fine decor and seating.  This is definitely not a Denny's.  This Café is open 24/7 a rare find on the \"strip\". We came for breakfast which is served anytime and we were satisfied with the portions of our meals as well as the price.

Grilled ham steak and eggs for $4.99 you really cannot pass up.  Also available are burgers and steaks for a reasonable price point.  The full menu has many more breakfast and sandwich options at higher prices.  My eggs came out perfect as requested and the ham steak was a thick cut with only a little fat near the middle.  They gave me the wrong toast but who cares, if its bread it's all good. 

Service was friendly and fun from Linda. A little slow when it came to pay the check but we did not mind because we were just visiting with family."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and have seen this place go through a lot of changes. So far, I think this is the best change I have seen. 

Let's first start when I walked in. On this particular visit, I noticed they were a bit short handed, based on the wait time I had for the hostess/cashier to formally greet us, as she had a line of customers that were paying for their meals. When she did finally had a minor break, she apologized for the wait and gave us a booth. 

The service level from the server was awesome. Lovely sense of humor, and quick on the draw. I ordered the hard hat sirloin steak special, which is an ongoing \"promotion\" for the current renovations Palace Station is undergoing. The potatoes were soft and flavorful, not too buttery. Steak was just right; juicy and flavorful, not too salty. 

What brought my review to five stars was the fact that the manager on duty stepped in and helped out the server, as well as the hostess because they were short handed. You don't see many MOD's do that nowadays and I thought that was pretty awesome of him to be out and about instead of locked up in his office. A good leader makes for an awesome crew. 

I definitely recommend this place if you are not looking for something fancy, but something to \"hold you over\" that is not fast food. Also, if you have a boarding pass (players card), you can earn points from your meal. FYI."}
{"text":"What's great about the restaurant is that the staff is friendly and the ambience is nice. It's a a comfortable place to enjoy breakfast or lunch. The bad thing is that it seems sometimes they are not very prompt about seating you. What's worse is that the food is sometimes simply awful. I've had a delicious steak there sometimes and then others the steak was so bad I had to spit it out (literally). I consider myself a steak lover and I normally don't waste time with mediocre steaks but this restaurant is convenient for me for a quick breakfast which is why I keep trying it. At first I'd order the steak and eggs with hash browns. But then the hash browns became in edible (as if they changed chefs). So I starting skipping that and just getting the steak and eggs but now the steaks are gross. It's a real shame because I NEED this restaurant to be good but its just a drag on the casino. I'm shocked at how little green valley ranch seems to notice how bad their cafe has become."}
{"text":"Empty restaurant, wait time 5 minutes. Poor customer service. Pastries  looks good but very expensive. Still waiting for my table...20 minutes later!!! Don't think i want to come back here or recommend for people to come here.
Food was okay. Not all that. Wait staff service was ok."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was okay. Coffee was good and hot in the carafe the server left for us. I had to country fried steak and eggs for breakfast. The country fried steak was extremely chewy and fatty. Even cutting it with a steak knife destroyed the breading,which pretty much fell apart. There was a male in the kitchen area yelling at or about someone. This was very unprofessional and included some profanity. Our server said that the restaurant delivery was still at the resort's receiving area and she had to scrounge for the cream for our coffee. Maybe this is why someone was upset, but still, there are guests around."}
{"text":"There is a 3 course meal deal for lunch that I don't think people know about. Yes, it's the Grand Cafe, so it's a 3 star 3 course meal. But, sometimes, that is what you need. 

You get an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. If you have to work late, this is a great place to fuel up before heading back to work. Don't expect greatness, but expect to be full for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Came here to try their big wheel special, wasn't too bad at all. Prices are reasonable for what you get. Only downside is when sitting at the counter, the waiter was very very slow on taking our orders and even getting a refill on drinks. Wish they would speed it up just a little bit. There were several people working that afternoon but of course they only designate one person to the counter area!

May come back next time to try the other specials they have."}
{"text":"Watered down coffee, steak was soft because of tenderizer, very dry. I put A lot of steak sauce to cover up the taste and still didnt finished it. Price is cheap, but quality is even cheaper. Definitely not coming back. So sorry. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Got an egg, spinach and goat cheese omelet with hash browns and wheat toast.  It was OK, I don't expect much when it comes to breakfast.  The omelet was big and filled with a lot of stuff but my hash brown was runny.  The coffee was very light where I can practically see through it.  Since  Starbucks doesn't offer the breakfast sandwiches, I was stuck going to this place. It was OK, I didn't mind it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times over the last year because we stay at this hotel for work. The food is very good, however I have never experienced a more miserable staff or slower service. Each time I have eaten here, I have had 3 different waitresses and all of them are just plain rude."}
{"text":"Went here at 2 in the morning with my fam and some Yelp peeps after just getting done with our bowling UYE.

Already I have a bad first impression because as soon as the hostess saw there was about 12 of us, she told us it was gonna be about half an hour before we can get a table. As I looked around, it didn't seem like they were busy at all. I would say overall you had about 8 tables of customers being tended to. The feeling I was getting was that the hostess didn't really wanna be there.

So after about 35 minutes we finally got to sit down. It took about 10 minutes before our server came to get our order. We were all actually ready with our orders but she said she was gonna take our drink order first and to put that in. That's stupid. We already had 10 minutes to go over the menu and decide what we want but yet she insisted on getting our drink orders first. 

So she brings our drinks out after about another 10 minutes. We give her our order and off she went. What happened next almost made me walk out. It took 30 minutes, yes, 30 MINUTES for her to bring out our food. She could have refilled my soda at least twice in that time frame and for your information she never did. So by the time we got our food, it was just a little after 3 am.

I know what you're thinking. Since we had a party of 12, of course its natural that making that much food will take a while. Only thing was that all the food we ordered was off the graveyard special menu, meaning pancakes, eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. So all the items we ordered were simple and quick things to make.

The first couple times I ate here around the same time, it was decent. This third time, I am now convinced not to eat here any more. It seemed everybody's attitude that worked there was like they did not wanna be there. If you don't like your job, find something else. We as a party did not demand anything special or were rude in our interactions. Even the manager I spoke to said it was usually slow around that time. I think he didn't wanna be there either. 

So in closing, just because they are 24 hours and they have graveyard specials, that doesn't always translate to great service and great food. For this place, the food is decent but the really bad service gives you a bitter taste in your mouth. I recommend going to Fatburger in the food court. They are 24 hours as well but I guarantee you wont have to wait an hour to get your food."}
{"text":"We love staying at Red Rock Casino yet we had the worst experience yesterday for breakfast at Grand Café. We arrived 10 am. We were seated quite fast ( my fiancé is a President member) yet we waited at least 30 min for any service for drinks. Our waitress was not even remotely in our area for 30 min. We tried to get the attention of our waitress but she motioned from afar three times ' be right with you' but made us wait longer while she chatted with the bar person. The food we waited for a further 30 min and my fiancé was running late for his appointment with his family and had to leave. One hour in total .. no food. The El Salvadoran born bus waiter was very kind though as he made sure that we were ok for drinks (after they eventually came).  Our waitress came up and tried to tell me management is responsible for the kitchen delays. Yet in my experience in hospitality the waitress should be hustling the cooks to hurry. To top off everything our waitress haphazardly handed me a piece of paper (the bill) without a pen to even sign the bill with. 
I understand restaurants have bad days but I hope for them this isn't the standard way of running their business. 
Everyone there waited for ages for their food., not just us. The place felt chaotic and they really need to get their act together especially being a part of a great hotel. Grand Cafe does the Red Rock Casino no service."}
{"text":"I decided to take a spin out to Red Rock in the early hours of the morning to grab a little cheap breakfast at the Grand Cafe. I opted for a simple eggs sunny side up with bacon, hash browns and toast. I don't think I have ever seen someone fry a sunny side up egg like this place lol super amazing how good it was cooked big props to that chef-cook in the kitchen on Feb 5th 2018 at around 5:30 AM. Customer service was great I was seated fast, food came out super quick. No headaches no problem here for less then $15 with tip included a great little spot to eat. how can I complain? I can't!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I have not updated this place to 5 stars. I continue to arrive with a warm welcome from the hostess (I always come after midnight). I always get informed of the correct amount of time to wait. I always get great service, amazing steak, and absolute orders.

5 stars to the most consistent and almost perfect graveyard restaurant to go to!"}
{"text":"Went to the Grand Cafe at the Red Rock, before our movie.   I've been here several times. I love getting the Philly steak sandwich w/cheese, onions and I add mushrooms.  It has always been delicious, so I don't order anything new. Like always, I ordered it.  I took a picture and was excited to tasty it. Here's where things turned.  

I took my first bite and was chewing.  I then realized that there was a long hair in my mouth, twisted around the meat.  I started to pull it out.  It seemed like forever, as I was holding back my gag reflex.   Soooo disgusting.  I immediately called over the waitress.   

The waitress (Jerrilynn, which was awesome), apologized over and over.  She took it to the Manager, Don.   He came over to apologize.  He said, there's not much I can say'. WTF.  He ask what else he could have made for me.  I wasn't even sure I could eat, being so grossed out, I needed a few minutes to see if I could get over it.  He kept making suggestions, like the Prime Rib (most expensive item on the menu - I'll get to that comment later).  He kept standing there for an awkward amount of time, until the waitress saved me by saying, let's give her a few minutes.  

The waitress came back a couple of times to see if I was ready, but no pressure.  After about 15 minutes, and my BF was done with his food, the waitress came back and I told her I would try something completely different.  I ordered the Bread Pudding French Toast.  

The French toast was absolutely delicious.  I took half home, since my regular appetite hasn't returned and my BF had finished along time ago and we didn't want to be late for our movie.  Again the waitress was so apologetic and gave us our bill.   

We finished and headed to the cashier.  I noticed that my Philly was removed from the bill, but the French toast remained.  I thought it would have been a nice gesture by the new Manager to take off that item, since my dining experience was ruined by their employee's hair that was half way down my throat, on my first bite!  I asked the cashiers to call for him.    Side note:   Every time I go there, seems like the same cashiers (Hispanic girls), are never friendly!!!    A lot of people need jobs, and they should be thankful to be working for an awesome hotel, therefore, being happy while they are working.    

The manager arrived, I told him that it would have been nice for him to check out our bill 'before' we received it and was surprised to see the French Toast on there. So....  my thoughts on how he handled this.  Once he figured that he lost the revenue on the Philly, he wanted to still profit by getting me to pay for some other food,  don't forget about the most expensive item on the menu that he wanted me to get, the Prime Rib.  After I asked him, he didn't reply, but took the receipt from my hand and headed to a register.  He came back with not much to say.  I think he said 'I've taken care of it'. I wanted to say, Yeah, only after I had to bring it up to you (which was awkward and embarrassing for me).  

Well, I love the Red Rock Hotel and Casino, and all they have to offer, but I can't say if I'll be back to the Grand Cafe.  If I do, it will be because of the waitress."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would, we waited a while to be seated, we got drinks but order wasn't right, took waitress 8 minutes to come to the table to take our order, she never came back :( it was not busy 3/4 of cafe was empty and management was seating down eating"}
{"text":". It's a fancy sit down restaurant inside Red Rock Casino and we were there for the Breakfast. We chose the Budget option which was pancakes, eggs and sausage. The Coffee was awesome. My son enjoyed his chocolate chip pancakes from the kids menu."}
{"text":"If I rated the food alone, this would be a two star review.  But the service here was really terrific, and I had a good time, so three stars.

They are doing some serious remodeling at Palace Station and everything feels more than a little crowded.  In appreciation of customers putting up with the inconvenience, the Grand Cafe has a number of Hard Hat Specials.  

I wasn't even planning on eating here, but the sign with the \"Hard Hat\" Specials caught my eye.  The \"Hard Hat\" Breakfast (2 eggs, 2pieces of Bacon, 2 Link Sausages, 2 Pancakes, and Hash Browns) was only $4.99 and it came with a Free Cup of Coffee.  Dang, I gots to get me some of that!

The hostess granted my request for a booth. A drink server appeared instantly and I ordered up a cup of joe.  I hate those little containers of ultra pasteurized cream so I put in a request for a little milk.  My coffee and a little pitcher of milk appeared moments later.  I was surprised how much I liked the coffee.  I really doubted I would.

I settled back in the booth and grabbed a Keno ticket and a crayon. But before I could mark it up, my waiter, Fernando, shows up with a big smile to take my order.  I ordered up the Hard Hat breakfast and a side of Toast.  

It didn't seem like the place was that busy, but my order took a long time.  I wasn't in any hurry to be anywhere, so it really didn't bother me.   I finished my coffee.  The drink server came by and filled me up.  Then again.  I was half was through the second refill when the food showed up.

I was really shocked.  It's served on an oversized metal platter that looks more like a garbage can lid than a plate you eat food from.  Looking at the picture just now I noticed it's actually some sort of faux \"skillet.\"  At the time I didn't notice the comical little handle. 

Anyway, appearance wise, it was easily one of the least appealing restaurant breakfasts I've ever seen.  The poached eggs were in a rediculously oversized coffee cup.  The eggs were poorly drained and sitting in about a tablespoon of poaching liquid.  And one of the yolks was already broken.   The platter was so big all the other components of the meal seemed disconnected.  It was just an abominable presentation.

Taste wise, most everything was OK.  The big exception being the pancakes.  They looked beautiful but they were terrible.  They were so tough they were inedible.  Disappointing, but it didn't really matter, I had plenty of food in front of me. 

Although the food was just OK, the service was pretty good.  I spotted the manager walking towards me as I was waiting to pay and mentioned to him I enjoyed my visit.  His reaction to my compliment was similar to what you would expect from an embezzling bank teller being introduced to an auditor.   

I said, \"I just wanted to compliment your team on the wonderful customer service.\"  His eyes darted left and right, only briefly meeting mine as he muttered a weak \"Thanks.\"  It appeared as he couldn't get away fast enough.   It struck me as odd that he would be so unlike the personable people that work for him.   Weird, but who knows, the cat might be a great manager. 

Mikey C says: good service trumps a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say based on the reviews I was a bit worried but I was decently impressed. The chillaquiles were good, the meat was a tad dry but over all I would give it a 7 out of 10. The bread pudding French toast was DIFFERENT, but different is good. I haven't had a French toast like this before, it's not typical in terms of texture so beware of this. Although, I would say it was good so try it if you are interested. The hash Brows (served crispy) were excellent! 

We are going to try the tiramisu tonight, to be continued!"}
{"text":"Simply stated, this place sucks.  Stay away if you value your health.

I've eaten here three times, and each of the first two times I swore I would never come back.  Third time I learned my lesson.

The service is hideous. But the food is beyond hope.

If you doubt me, then swing in one of these days and order the so-called chicken fried \"steak.\"  I'm still trying to figure out what kind of meat is in there but it definitely is not steak.  It's not even low grade hamburger meat.  Whatever it is, it is full of non-digestible fat and guts.

They can't even make toast correctly, unless black is your flavor.

Eat here at your own risk.

UPDATE: How is this place still in business? Do people not read these reviews??"}
{"text":"First and last time. I'm sorry. After stand at the door with no greeting we decided to grabbed the menu ourselves to go over it. They have American and Asian menu combined. And we put down the menu and stand there. finally the hostess approached and seated us. We seriously sat down for a good 10 mins with no sign and no clue who's gonna be our server. And of course eventually someone have to serve right? Just to wait and have the drinks to the table without taking our order as well I woulda just walk out. But since oyster bar were too busy so we decide to try this place. And SERIOUSLY after the first bad impression me and my friend decided to time how long our food gonna be served. Lol. 
We only ordered prime ribs and wonton noodles. That's all. Literally it took 40 mins. Server was not friendly or seemed not even care either. When we asked the cashier were they understaff she replied each employee have to do 3 persons jobs...fix it grand cafe."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars...Yelp really needs to incorporate the 1/2 stars into the reviews! 

We went for breakfast this morning and had a pleasant visit. This was my first time visiting this cafe despite the fact that Ive been to the casino a million times in the past 6 months. The room is beautiful. Probably the nicest casino \"cafe\" I can remember dining at with the exception of maybe Red Rock Casino.

I had the three cheese omelette, while my friend had a Philly Cheesesteak. Both items were very tasty and arrived in a well timed manner. The service wasn't bad, just seemed a bit cold and impersonal. People can have off days though, so I'm quite sure I'll be back at some point. Maybe one of these days I'll be able to check out those graveyard specials I keep hearing about!

All in all, not a bad experience, but I felt it could have been better. They'll get another chance in the future, at which time I'll update this review.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"What is it about Grand Cafe's?? First the terrible service at the GVR location and now this. I don't get it. Why have such a beautiful room if you are just going to mail it in when it comes to service?? 

We were at the Red Rock Lanes and bowling with friends when we all decided to grab a quick bite afterwards. Sunday night and the room isn't even a quarter occupied. Should be alright, right?

Nope.

(+) Room is beautiful and easily the best of the Grand Cafes. 
(-) Started off waiting nearly 10 minutes just to be seated even though it was very slow.
(-) Orders were taken in a timely fashion, but then it took literally 45 minutes to get our food! We watched a group of 4 get seated, order, AND receive their food before we received ours. Not f*cking cool at all. 
(-) during the 45 minute wait, no drinks were refilled and no one said a word to us to let us know why things were taking so long. Nice.

Once the food finally arrived, it was alright. Nothing to write home to Mom about, but it got the job done. Honestly, it was about what I was expecting. The food wasn't the problem, it was the shitty, lackluster service. I'm actually a little peeved right now because my friend erred in his math and over tipped these clowns. They sure as hell did NOT deserve the tip he gave them!

During this entire experience all I kept thinking about was the same experience I've had at other Grand Cafes, namely the one at GVR. Okay food, sh*t service. 

Not only am I one and done with this spot, I am quite done with ALL Grand Cafes.

1 star."}
{"text":"We came here to have breakfast with my Family and Boyfriend this past weekend. And they were waiting a head of time for us, so I felted a little rush to order. And I don't normally do breakfast, but I figured why not try something. I ended up choosing the Chicken Fried Steak with Eggs, Hash browns and a biscuit. I didn't end up eating much of the chicken fried steak but  it was okay.

We got great service and everything came out good, I  just should've ordered lunch like I always do."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE NO MATTER HOW HUNGRY YOU ARE....
NO EXACEGRATTION! I finished my dinner an hour ago on this Saturday night and couldn't wait to get back in the room because my stomach started turning so I couldn't tolerate to stay out even though it was a night I anticapted. 

FIRST OFF : I mistaked this for \"Grand Luxe Cafe\" because the whole visual theme was the same but I realized it wasnt the same since the menu prices were so much lower. 

SERVICE: Beyond careless & slow.

FOOD: When the entree finally came it was horrid. FYI, its been very rare in my life that I ever have them take my food back so it had to be really bad for me to go there. My friend was quite the whole time because he hated the tasteless weird tasting food but finally said something too.
When we decided to ask for management is when it got worse. We explained to the female manager and we both appologized for complaining because we understand the F&B industry. But man her reply was surreal! We didnt even mention about the poor customer service but my other friend that came in the past simply asked what happened to the food? He said it usex to be good. The manager replied \"Well I eat here everyday and its fine\"..... wth kind of statement is that?

BOTTOM LINE IS THEY HAVE HORRID SERVICE & POOR QUALITY FOOD. OUR FOOD WAS NOT CHARGED BUT MY GOD THAT EXPERIENCE WAS NOT WORTH EVEN TO GET PAID FOR!"}
{"text":"The Red Rock is a nice casino but honestly I expencted better from this restaurant.

It was decent especially for the pirce ($9.99 3 course meals) but i think i would have rather spent my $10 elsewhere.

Nothing fancy about it. I ordered the philly cheeseteak and the gf went for the prime rib end cut.

The cheesesteak wasnt anything crazy. just the same ol run of the mill cheesesteak. The meat was quite tender though.

The prime rib was pretty good as well  esp. for $15. 

The place isn't bad but nothing special at the same time.

Great service from the server to the bus boy though.

I kinda wish i went to a different more intersting spot to eat next time."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing so many Stations commercials about the bananas foster french toast.  it seemed like they had invested a lot into opening these up around the company so I decided to fill my craving one Sunday.

Needless to say I was very disappointed.  The French Toast was good, but it basically was just french toast with bananas on it, nothing special at all.  We did have a very funny waitress who made the experience good and kept refills coming, but I feel like they made a dish sound a lot fancier than it really was.

On the plus side, they do have some killer graveyard deals, which even if the food was just normal, would still be a steal!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the affordable options they had.  With a preferred card, we took advantage of the breakfast:

Pancakes, eggs, bacon for 4.99
Eggs, toast, hashbrowns for 3.99.
The drinks will be balance out your check, but it's a better and quick option than resort's weekend brunch buffet which will add up with a larger party.
Food was good, service was great."}
{"text":"Decent cafe food for fare prices. It's nothing to rave about but it will fill you up.

It has updated beautiful decor and food is basic cafeteria food. I've had good steaks made to perfection but fish and chips sux. No flavor."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant many chances, always receive bad service.  Waitresses are very slow.  The food is usually good but this morning it was just fair.  Not impressed.  I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Quick Look - Avoid at all costs on a busy weekend, they have a tough time keeping with demand in the kitchen. Second time eating here, and second time the order was messed up. Not going to be a third time for a ruined meal experience. Too many choices in this city. 

In Depth Review: Decided to eat here on a Sunday in late April. We arrived to Red Rock at 12pm and the place was slammed. There were easily 300+ people waiting in line for the brunch buffet (shocking). We were taken back to find that there was even a line for the Grand Cafe. Even had the velvet ropes set up that you would find at a busy Vegas nightclub (ridiculous). After a 10 minute wait we were sat. Waitress took another ten minutes to greet us and take our drink order, we over looked that and she seemed nice. We placed our orders, nothing crazy - Eggs Benedict, Mediterranean Egg Frittata & Short Stack Pancakes (side). 

So the wait begins, almost an hour after we placed our order, 45 minutes after the butter and syrup was brought to the table, the plates arrive. The eggs Benedict is ice cold, the hash-browns on the side undercooked and mushy. The Mediterranean Frittata was cold, the English Muffin on side Luke-warm. The only item up to par was the pancakes. So we were a little upset, and asked for them to please remake the eggs and serve us hot food. Cold cooked eggs is not what we wanted. The waitress said the kitchen was slammed and that the manager was helping plate the items and that she would speak with them. She also suspected that the pre-poached eggs Benedict was to blame. They are NOT cooked fresh to order apparently. 

The female manager came out about ten minutes later to apologize and blamed it on 600 people checking out of the hotel at once. Said she would comp a round of drinks for us for our troubles (whatever). So we placed a drink order with waitress, guess what? That was also messed up. Sent over a drink we did not even order. We are having some bad luck, it was becoming laughable. Then the food comes out, and the Benedict is still not cooked properly, and the side of hash-browns is still undercooked and mushy. The Frittata was fine but my appetite was gone. At this point we just asked for the check. They comped the round of drinks (big deal). We paid, still left a nice tip (waitress was very pleasant) and promptly left. 

Side Note: Our first visit to here was mid-week, about a month ago. The restaurant was empty on that visit, somehow the waitress ordered me food that I did not ask for. It was an honest mistake and they corrected it. It still demonstrated that they have some issues to deal with at the Grand Cafe. 

In Summary: We were willing to overlook an issue with our first visit and give it a second chance. After yesterdays poor showing, there will be a third visit here. Like I said above, there are way too many options in this city. 

Hopefully Station Casinos will take notice and make corrective action. Especially after reading the other poor reviews online. They are not the best, and what a beautiful casino like Red Rock should be comfortable with. It's a nice restaurant and has potential. Right now it's not living up to the standards of this resort."}
{"text":"The menu is good. The food is the same as their other property's just more money. Fish tacos good, salads good. Prime rib dip, not prime at all, fries are to skinny & don't stay hot. Eat at the counter its quicker.  Martin 6-7-13"}
{"text":"I had a good meal. I ordered a blt with garlic fries. It came out quick & fresh. My drink was always full. Gabe the server was great. I took home some cheesecake from the bakery inside the cafe. Considering there aren't many coffee shops in the casinos anymore, I appreciate that you still have them."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service and incredibly slow. Food is mediocre. They offer no apologies. Save your money, your time, and your sanity!"}
{"text":"Nothing spactaular...our food was tasty, service was good.  Price is typical Vegas hotel range.  We would eat here again."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast because it looked quiet (not very busy) and didn't want an all you can eat buffet.  Ordered the steak & eggs for $15.99, comes with toast and hash browns.  Also ordered coffee for $2.99.  Sat at the bar so I could watch some sports on one of the overhead TVs, the coffee and atmosphere were good.  Then the food came.  Asked for crispy hash browns, they came out very undercooked.  The steak was good size and thick.  Since I asked for medium rare, should be no problem.  Wrong!  It was well done and dry.  Couldn't eat it.  The replacement steak was much smaller and very thin.  Second attempt at hash browns, subpar.  The cook got the eggs and toast correct.  Very disappointing and I hadn't planned on spending that much time for breakfast. Should have heeded the negative reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"Every so often because of my degenerative ways, Red Rock sends me coupons for free food and beverage at their resort.  Usually I utilize them at the buffet or LBS, but something inspired me to try the Grand Cafe on my latest sortie over there.  Maybe it was the high ceilings, or the pastries displayed in the glass cases that you can see from the casino at the front of the restaurant, but the place looked really appetizing.  I held out hope that a casino cafe could truly be inspiring, alas however it was not to be.  I found a standard offering that  serves its purpose and nothing more.  I should have realized this earlier, I mean I keep watching Saturday Night Live thinking its going to be funny again, but it never is.

Now don't get me wrong, the food is fine enough and never really disappointed.  I opted for their \"3 course\" menu and got the turkey with mashed potatoes, vegetables and gravy. It reminded me of something I would get at a cafe in middle America which had some nostalgic value but its not going to get confused for thanksgiving day.  For my appetizer, I opted for the shrimp cocktail and for desert I got the brownie sundae.  Neither were big or particularly amazing, but they were edible and satiated. 

Overall, I think my total bill with a drink came to 14 bucks which my coupon mostly covered,  Would I come here again?  Perhaps if I was at the casino but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.  The breakfasts looked standard and I think thats where they do the bulk of their business.  Service was friendly and efficient although it should be noted I was eating at around 10pm on a Wednesday (remember how I said I was a degenerate?)  In any event, an unremarkable meal which I guess for a casino cafe is kind of what you should be shooting for.  Although Im going to keep searching for that one that will surprise me...and waiting for Mike Myers to rejoin the cast of SNL too!

High ceilings and pastries in glass cases will get me every time..."}
{"text":"Great food and fast friendly service.   For a late night dining this is one of the best cafes out of all the stations with a affordable price for what you get."}
{"text":"Located in Red Rock Casino & Hotel. Decent food. Obviously, if you are in the hotel, convenient location and open 24hrs."}
{"text":"Dined here with my dad for the steak and eggs special ($8.99) at 1 am. It was alright for the price. 
It wasn't busy at all but our order took awhile to get to the table. 
On the other hand, our server, Saul, was very nice and kept consistent conversations with my dad whenever he came by. The thing is that my dad is a very impatient dude and it gets frustrating when he keeps on complaining but I'm too tired to tolerate it. 

We ordered the cookie in a skillet with ice cream on top for dessert. It was pretty good. 
Not sure if I would come back for steak and eggs but only maybe if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a very nice looking restaurant. Honestly this review is long overdue. About 1 month late. My family and I accidentally got in line thinking it was the Vietnamese restaurant next door. Seating was fairly fast granted it was during mother's day weekend. Our server was very friendly however we ordered 3 salmons and 2 steaks and they forgot about our order. After waiting about an hour and a half we got a fruit plate from the manager apologizing for the inconvenience but sadly still never received our meal due to computer error. I don't think I will ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Of course a 24 hour restaurant, I really don't expect much from it. Just to have a place to sit and eat. I understand that its located at Red Rock Casino, and of course a lot of people will probably think, \"It got to be good, since its at Red Rock Casino.\" So lot of people will probably have high expectations of the place, and I bet you, not many of them will have their expectations met. 

As for me, I did have some mix feelings about the place. It is a fancy looking cafe, located in one of the popular station casinos. So thinking, that it's in a fancier casino, pricing is probably a bit more then expected. But knowing that it is a 24 hour joint, the first thing I think of is, Denny's. Which brings the thought of food, that's fairly done, but not quite done the way you want it, or it's done, where you can't even stand touching it.  But you'll probably eat it, cause its edible, or that, you're really hungry, you'll eat anything.

I had the Philly cheese steak, with fries. I loved how the sandwich was made and the bread was just right. But the french fries on the other hand, were kind of dry and crunchy. But again, I really don't expect much at a 24 hour cafe. There are some out there that does better, others are just average. Grand Cafe, is one of those average ones,  in a high end station casino.  

I would recommend this, if you're only looking for a place to sit and eat. But, remember that you're at one of the high end station casinos, which may make it pricey, depending what you pick. Don't set your expectations to high, cause it is a 24 hour cafe, and the food is probably average for any kind of 24 hour diner out there."}
{"text":"We've been getting bad service here lately. We've been eating here but lately the servers have been unfriendly and lazy. I asked for extra crispy fries and of course my order came and the fries was not even close to being crispy! The waitress took it back ( i don't know who to blame, the cook or the waitress). We waited to get the fries back for 25 min!!! Really!!!! 25 min to make it crispy?? OMG!!! Then i asked for a box and that took awhile as well. So i had to get my own box from the hostess. The waitress saw me and made a comment \"Oh, I thought you didn't want it any more\"! Really!!! The people next to us saw everything and was shaking their heads saying \"Green Valley better get their act together \". It's too bad that this waitress ruined our favorite place to eat for midnight snack!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Get a players card and you only pay $9.99 per person. The food here was pretty fresh and they have a variety of Mexican, American and I think Italian to choose from. They decor was a little outdated and their service was good too. Be smart and order orange juice on the side. You get free champagne.. So, now you can make your own mimosas!!! Great deal for under ten bucks!! The only thing I didn't like was they had several open tables but, the line was out the door? It didn't make sense! 

Great place outside the strip to eat at!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Bridget and Zack were fabulous servers. They put us in a place where we could visit with her friends out of town so it made it very nice and cozy. Everybody enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Very bad service, waited 30 min for my bagel...:(( plus food was not that good, won't be coming back here. Must be because it is located inside a casino and they really don't give a shit about all the degenerates that come in here to eat."}
{"text":"going to any casino on memorial day weekend is sketchy but my boyfriend wanted to go to the sports book to watch basketball....and of course the buffett line was over an hour long so we looked around and decided no wait at the grand cafe! sweet! we got seated right away due to the catchy flyers outside the resturaunt we didnt have look our menus long lol. my boyfriend had the tbone steak (9.99) dinner. he ordered it medium rare came with baked potatoe and veggies. he said nothing special but well worth 10 bucks. I had grilled cheese burger with fries and just like all the pics fries came in nifty basket! my burger was medium well and was soooo tasty! purrrfect grilled cheese with a tasty burger stuffed in the middle. no fixins on the burger but really didnt need any. (i would have loved some grilled onions). my dinner was 9.50. we added dinner salads which were a spring mix (not my fave ) with really awesome orange heirloom tomatoes . after dinner we paid our tab and right by the register there is a coffee and dessert counter. my man was so thoughtful and got me a mini cannoili  to top off my date. we are thinking of making this our spot when we go! highly recommend!!!"}

The cafe was not full, I sit at 2:40am the food came back at 3:30am

Listen guys time is money. If you think you goin to save 2 dollars by coming here you will regret it."}

{"text":"Grand Cafe took over the location of the Original Pancake House inside Green Valley Ranch. I went to the Pancake House once and it was DISASTROUS so I was pretty sure Grand Cafe couldn't be any worse.

We had breakfast here before checking out on Mother's Day so it was pretty busy even around 9 AM. I think the food is just OK for the price - I mean, $11 for a waffle with fruits on top?? You can get that and more at the buffet next door for $4.99. On the plus side, if you check in on Foursquare, all entrees priced $6.99 and up are BOGO free. I also saw signs around the casino for late night specials like $1.99 pancakes or $2.99 burger and fries, so maybe that's worth checking out as well."}
{"text":"I grabbed breakfast here with my mom before we hit the road back to LA. I had the eggs benedict, which I probably haven't eaten in 10 years. The eggs were so perfectly poached that it pained me to break them, but the hollandaise was kind of bland. I can't remember what hollandaise tastes like, but I can't imagine that butter + egg yolks would equal bland. My mom had corned beef hash which looked (and tasted) very similar to the canned kind. 

The breakfast here was just okay. I don't know why there is always a big line because it's not even cheap. Next time I will just grab a starbucks and hit the blackjack tables."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Grand Cafe at the Red Rock Casino. It was lunchtime on a Saturday and there was a bit of a line. A hostess was walking the line asking how many were in each party. But the line was so long as was her list of numbers, I don't know how she gathered any useful information and, of course, we were asked how many when we reached the front of the line anyway. We weren't given a choice of \"booth or table\" and we ended up at a small table near the door to the kitchen. That turned out to be a stroke of luck....because when our drinks arrived--a soda and a coffee--I was not given a straw and hubby had no spoon to stir his coffee. We couldn't flag down a server, so my husband simply walked to the kitchen door and hollered in for the needed utensils! After quite a wait for our food, my Corned Beef and Swiss Cheese sandwich finally came.....without the Swiss Cheese. But it was easier this time to wave down our server--he was at a nearby table apologizing to them for some negligence! Once the missing cheese was replaced, I will say that the sandwch was quite tasty and the side of mushroom soup was very, very good. I left feeling satisfied with the food, but the customer service definitely knocked off a few stars!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to the grand cafe @ green valley ranch. When we first arrived we were told there were 2 parties ahead of us. There were plenty of open tables visible. They should staff better for Sunday breakfast. 
Once we were seated we waited 15 mins before the server even approached our table. It took her another 10 mins to bring us waters. Considering they weren't extremely busy it took forever for them to bring our food. Its breakfast it doesn't take that long. 
Then to polish the whole experience off, when I went to go pay for the check I was not acknowledged I wait to wait for the server to get their change before the cashier even acknowledged me. There was no sense of urgency during my whole experience there. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So ridiculously slow!  Wait forever to get seated. Ordered soup to start and it took 18 minutes for it to come out. Come on it is soup!  Still waiting for our entrees, if they don't come soon, we are getting ready to walk out. By far the worse restaurant in all of Red Rock.  This is not our first visit, thought we would give it another chance. Teach us."}
{"text":"Another gem with the Las-Vegas casino ONLY price. 

The good:
- Large portioned steak meals with sub $8 prices
- A lot of seating, so you'll probably be seated right away  

The MEH:
This is probably no fault of their own, but they could use more waiters after midnight. My friends and I came in at 4am from a ... fun night, and wanted to refuel, but there was only one lovely waitress serving a horde of hungry, jaded people. We had to wait about half an hour for our food, even though we ordered before the other people coming in. 

Tip: Be mindful of their time and tip well knowing this place operates 24/7!"}
{"text":"We had been here before and ordered the prime rib special and it was ok but there are better prime rib specials in Las Vegas for less money.  On Saturday 2/22/14 we decided to eat here again and I ordered the NY steak but my partner ordered the prime rib special even after warning him that it wasn't that great.  Of course the server had to say it was the best thing on the menu, well what was delivered was a piece of meat that looked freezer burned and was half yellow fat.  The meat was rubbery and disgusting.  It literally looked like the meat was frozen and rapidly cooked before it was plated.  The NY strip was delicious I will give them 4 stars on the NY strip but the prime rib should be taken off the menu.  Also the server was nice until we sent the prime rib back."}
{"text":"Had the worst prime rib ever here. When the cashier asked how my visit was, I told her just that. I'm usually disappointed with everything at a Station property, so no big surprise here."}
{"text":"This location has been our brunch of choice for about 3 years now. However, not any longer. The food quality has gone steadily down for the past year or so. They keep changing the staple menu items with smaller and lower quality products. They have stopped providing a variety of individual jars of jam with breakfast and now bring you a plate with portioned out jam, butter, and catsup.  All of which look like they have been shelved for a while prior to making it to your table. The ham steak platter, which was one of my favorites is now served in a skillet that makes everything taste like metal and the \"ham steak\" now has the texture of something you would find in the processed deli isle of the grocery store. And forget asking for anything to be prepared a certain way, your requests seem to fall on deaf ears. Sad, used to be a quality meal and a decent price. Now it's just a run of the mill diner experience."}
{"text":"I needed to eat after a poker tournament, and none of the Asian restaurants were open, so i went to the Cafe.  My cup of chicken noodle soup was full of shredded chicken, bow tie pasta, and veggies, but the broth was bland.  I also tried the chili cheese fries.  I liked the scattering of diced tomatoes and green onions on top."}
{"text":"My basketball friends and I went here after hoopin at tarkanian. If you sign up for a players card you can be eligible for the after midnight menu. $0.99 pancakes, biscuits and gravy, $2 1/2 lbs burger n fries, $6 steggs, etc.. Pretty good deal and food is not that bad. I like their steak n eggs here better than south point actually. terrible service tho. My friend requested to have his eggs on the side and she said she wouldn't do it lol. Rude much? Then he also asked for more powdered sugar and she made a remark \"you need more than what's on it?\" never got refills. She gave us the bill right after she dropped the food and never saw her again. it's cheap eats but service doesn't have to be. We still gave her a great tip and maybe she'll treat us better next time."}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING, and everyone enjoyed their meals. Don't shy away from this place if you're looking for casual American food. They put some creative curveballs on the menu, and I wish I had the time to eat breakfast there again. Unpretentious, well-made stuff."}
{"text":"Meh, the food here isn't bad, but it's not OMG awesome either. The chicken noodle soup is pretty good though. The breakfast food is ok, but a little over priced. Everything else.. The sandwiches aren't as good as Capriottis, and they are  more expensive. The burgers are better at yardhouse and lbs.. The only thing this place is really good for, is the fact it's open 24 hours, and that there are specials after midnight..
The service is polite, but so slow."}
{"text":"Ok - normally I don't end up paying to eat at these sorts of joints.  For the amount of cash that my brother and I throw around (thankfully this is only a couple times a year), we end up with comps to various joints in the casinos.

Enter the Red Rock.  I end up not wanting to deal with haggling with a floor boss and opted to just get a quick brunch meal for The Wife and I.  I ordered the tuscan salad and clam chowder while getting french toast for The Wife.

Overall, not bad.  Not great either.  Geoff, the bartender, did chat me up a bit while I was waiting on the chow but otherwise it was a rather unremarkable experience."}
{"text":"Most people who know of my travels to sin city, also know of my love for the Red Rock Casino (http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2) and everything associated with it.  Well, almost everything, except for Grand Cafe.

Like it's weaker sister location at the Green Valley Ranch (http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2), Grand Cafe is the lowest end of the dining totem pole.  Yes, even lower than FatBurger and most other chains in the resort, because at the very least even they can consistently crank out tolerable food.  Couple that with some other major service snafus and it's not hard to see this cafe is already on the downward spiral.

Since Grand Cafe is 24 hours, it's typically the source for room service food.  If you're going to order for your room, you should save the trouble and try another casino dining establishment instead - your stomach and your wallet will thank you.

Service has always been lackluster at best.  My many visits here both late night and early morning have been with wait staff who seem more apathetic than not.  It might just be my bad luck but I've lost count from how many service related issues I've had with my food.  Management needs to start hiring from the same pool of folks that are staffed in other establishments or the quality will continue to suffer.

And with regards to the quality of the food, something is almost always off.  Breakfast foods have been bland and dry, salads have been uninspiring, even burgers and sandwiches were disappointing.  Casual dining isn't supposed to be this hard.  To offer any suggestions outside of getting a new kitchen and wait staff may prove to be too difficult.  But they could certainly use the help.

One of these days if they cook an egg or even a proper burger, we can revisit the idea of trying Bland (not Grand) Cafe."}
{"text":"They have deffinately gotten better, I know I said I woukd never be back but I've come a couple times, once because my mom told me they have corned beed hash (not the canned stuff like most places) so I gave it a try and omg it was amazing, so a few months after that ot was a late night and I really wanted some of that corned beef again so u came here and they totally changed up the menu and don't have my corned beef late night anymore!! I was dissapointed about that but they did have decent food still so I wasnt too upset lol I would be back anytime of the day because even tho they don't still have my corned beef the food is good and the service has gotten a lot better than before :)"}
{"text":"Hangry af right now.

My boyfriend and I always come here , and the service is okay.
Today it's just crap.
 There was the guy who served us waters, but he was just a busser. ( it was his 4th day there. Let him become a server so he can take orders, because he was at least attentive with us)
We were there for 20 mins... waiting... looking around... 
Even the manager looked at us ?!!??? If you have customers looking around , menus closed/stacked on the table , and served with drinks. The best thing to do is check on them. You have to teach your servers with rotations , and  letting them know timing is everything.
It was barely even busy?! 

seriously.

I can handle the \"okay\" service, but I can't handle the wait when the restaurant is not even busy."}
{"text":"Gabe the server was very lazy, unfriendly, and just provides poor and terrible service! Don't bother that you will get a refill of your drink because he is very lazy."}
{"text":"As I was driving to Red Rock, I was thinking of the hierarchy of rocks in our society.  Pet Rock, Third Rock From The Sun, Rock 'n' Roll, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, 30 Rock . . .  Where would Red Rock rank?  Would it, pardon the pun, rock my world?

Grand Cafe at Red Rock is everything one could want in a Vegas cafe and a lot more.  We came here last Monday around 8:30 am and were seated right away.  The hostess was very friendly, and she managed to strike up a conversation with while showing us to our spacious booth.  We walked by the pastry counter, which, as you might imagine, was NOT easy to do.  Tantalizing chocolate covered strawberries, delicious sticky buns and cavity-causing candied apples taunted us as we pretended not to notice the sweets.

As soon as we sat down, our waitress brought an iced tea for my friend and a stainless steel carafe of hot coffee for me.  Score!  The coffee was delicious, by the way.  Unlimited, readily available coffee and a steady supply of Splenda make Yan a happy boy.

I ordered a ham platter (ham steak, 2 scrambled eggs, hash browns and wheat toast) for $8.99.  We also decided to split a short stack of pancakes, which, in retrospect, was a fantastic idea.  The two pancakes they brought us were doughy, fluffy, delicious and very, very filling.  One a person was plenty.  The ham steak was almost as big as the pancakes, and almost just as good.  My scrambled eggs were made perfectly as well.  There was nothing wrong with that breakfast, let me tell ya.  

I have to mention the decor.  The whole restaurant, much like the casino itself, featured a modern, abstract motif.  Lines, squares, soothing colors and \"weird for the sake of weird\" paintings somehow made me feel at peace.  I also LOVED the plates they used.  Ornate yet simple, they reminded me of the plates my mom used to use when I was a little kid.  I got a sudden urge to clear the table after dinner, but I figured they had people for that.

If you're staying at the Red Rock, I strongly recommend having breakfast at Grand Cafe.  It's convenient, inexpensive and homey."}
{"text":"Normally visit another Station, but we were in the neighborhood and thought we'd give Palace a try. Got hungry and opted for the cafe. Cafe food is cafe food. The chicken nachos were about what you would expect from a casino cafe. The side salad was fresh and plentiful. The iced tea was fresh brewed and some of the best I've had. Our waiter, Laju, was attentive and friendly. Had better luck at the cafe than I did in the casino, which may alter any thoughts of returning."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. I can't even review the food because we bolted before it even got there. 
20 minutes to be seated and nobody in line. Place was 40% full.
15 minutes to get water or be greeted by waitress.
55 minutes for some sandwiches. Not sure how long it would have been because we left.

Waitress was flat out inattentive and manager(s) (we spoke to two) could not have cared less. 

Six people in our party. Left hungry and very disappointed. Other tables around us were about to get up and leave as well.  

Utterly dysfunctional crap."}
{"text":"You would expect a corporate restaurant to be run better. 
-waited 3 minutes to be seated because the manager didn't want to take the initiative without consulting with the hostess. the restaurant was practically empty.
-confusion on which server had my table.
-server took order and never saw her again.

Food-servers need to realize they are not just order takers - Order takers work at fast food joints.

another tip...check back on your customer within 2 bites or 2 minutes."}
{"text":"I have seen the commercials for this place on tv many of times and my wife and i thought we would try it out. .. ...  BIG MISTAKE. 

WORST SERVICE EVER .. we sat for 15 minutes before our drink order was taken ,  20 minutes to get out food , and our drinks were never refilled... and it wasnt even busy!.   

There was close to 15 people there walking around and working and they just IGNORED everyone. 

When i get my steak , it was over cooked , and instead of getting the onion strings and what not on it it was basically a steak , baked potatoe and veggies.... that had absolutly no FLAVOR. 

I left the woman the worst tip i have ever left in my life ( a dime ) and walked out completly disapointed. 

NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Looks wonderful, even after the remodeling. The decor is impressive, the portions are great, and the menu is diverse. Unfortunately, this place has a serious service problem.

I used to come here frequently for dinner and afternoon tea/sweets. The Prime Rib special was always impressive, and many items from the pastry case were a great afternoon pick-me-up.

On my most recent visit for breakfast, my table ordered one Hot Tea, one Iced Tea, and an Orange Juice for beverages. Waitress returned with the Orange Juice and Iced Tea, and took our food order for French Toast, a side of Bacon, a Fruit Cup, Wheat Toast, and a side of Sausage. Keep in mind the place was busy, but there were plenty of empty tables.

It then took six minutes for the Hot Tea to be delivered. From that point, it took 25 minutes to get just the Fruit Cup! Then the French Toast, Sausage, and Wheat Toast were delivered - Bacon was missing and took an additional five minutes. Asking for water also took a long time.

I usually adore the French Toast - normally soft bread with delicious vanilla flavor. This order was dry and lacked flavor. Though it was warm, it definitely tasted old. 

On top of this, the waitress consistently brought just one item to the table (like the Fruit Cup) saying \"Voila!\" and then walking away. This happened at least four times. She never asked how the food was or if we needed more of anything. 

This slow service seems to plague the Grand Cafe. Before the remodeling there were some employees that were often rude and unwelcoming on several occasions. Slow service was also an issue, and had me steering away from eating here. I expected a turn towards better service after the remodeling - clearly that isn't the case."}
{"text":"pancakes are delicious.  biscuits and gravy are very bland and need salt.  country fried steak not that good.  very gummy and batter was flaking off"}
{"text":"The cafe was great in the beginning for gamblers to eat after a night of playing. However now it seems they really reduced the late night specials for players and the wait time for your food is just too long. I had to get up and leave to have a smoke then come back in and wait some more. Customer service was okay but had to wait to just order because I couldn't find my players card and to order a graveyard special you need to have one. So they had to call a tech over to get my id and make me a new one. Then beside having to use a butter knife to cut up my steak I just wasn't feeling it. 

Last time I came here with a few people after playing bingo it was just awesome. Now I think it's been around awhile and just got complacent. In the future I'm going to just call it a night earlier from gambling and get a bite to eat somewhere I'll enjoy more."}
{"text":"For their midnight special review only!

You can not beat the terrific price for their midnight special! If you live in the northwest and want a midnight snack with nice ambiance, go to Red Rock's Grand Cafe. Caution: you're inside a restaurant in a casino so if you want a peaceful and somber ambiance, this is not for you. Music from the casino can be heard from inside the restaurant and also the slot machines whirring. 

The service is fast, and our server, E.G., is very friendly and accommodating. The hubs ordered steak and eggs and I ordered the bacon skillet. Except for the bacon, which was overcooked, The food is enjoyable and satisfying. Definitely a gem if you get hungry and are looking for a place for one quick bite and a game of poker!"}
{"text":"Where to start? First the steak and eggs went up a dollar, which I don't mind if the food is decent. My steak came out watery and my eggs were undercooked. When cutting my steak, there was water under there, as if it was defrosting. The eggs were really slimey and undercooked, that i was worried I was going to get sick. They went downhill and I was really disappointed. My stomach kind of hurt throughout the night. Raised their prices, but lowered their standards. I won't be back again, especially when there are other places with way better steak and eggs."}
{"text":"Four stars because the service was slow, the lines were long and it was way over priced for the two of us. None of the staff had a smile on their face either.
I gave it 4 stars because the mimosas were excellent and the French toast (bananas foster) was to die for. Very filling but so worth it and it's a great way to start a good morning."}
{"text":"Here's the low-down:   They are definitely a must at Texas Station if you're a night-owl and love steak and hamburgers! They serve breakfast all day, every day.  Their pastries are reasonably priced, tasty and they are rather large for the money.  Aside from these things, you're better off going to Denny's, iHop or the Feast Buffet only a few feet past the Starbucks farther into the casino area.  I say this because the portions are plenty for whatever food you get - as it fills your plate! - but the breakfast I received was anything by great.

  It didn't take two long for my boyfriend and I to get a table.  The blonde hostess was polite but definitely not very up-beat or \"smile-y\".  Being an ex-hostess myself, I realize how important it is to be very happy, enthusiastic and charismatic - it really sets the mood more than you would think. Nevertheless, I didn't feel very welcome and again, it was just \"blah\".  This cafe is not big at all from what I could see at the time of the day we arrived!  It's no wonder other Yelpers complain about the wait, the place is actually pretty small.  It's a little disorienting because I believe they block off half of the restaurant early in the day for some odd reason or another - I can only assume they open the place up for dinner and \"nightlight\" dining. 

  Anyway, on to the good bits, we got Mercedes who is by far the best waitress in the entire restaurant!  She was very sweet and she took the initiative to strike up a small conversation between us ordering, us waiting for food and once we actual began to eat.  It was a kind gesture and it made our experience better - we definitely felt more comfortable than initially waiting for a table, if you know what I mean.

  I ended up ordering coffee and orange juice for the drinks, the boyfriend just getting a water.  I went for the three egg veggie omelette with green bell pepper, mushrooms and spinach.  It comes with hash browns which is nice and for some reason it comes with a plethora of toast? I had FOUR slices on my plate.  Mercedes asked me if I wanted cheese on my omelette and I of course nodded, assuming she wanted my preference of cheese so I told her.  Little did I know, they charged us for it!  It was about two extra dollars added to the bill that was completely unnecessary. On top of it all, I also got a side of bacon - this was a terrible idea.  I asked how much it would be and Mercedes told me it would be $3.49.  That's right, almost $4 for FOUR slices of bacon!  Once I ordered it, I ate once slice but then crumbled the rest on my omelette.  In doing so by coincidence, Mercedes comes to the table a little later, saying that if she knew I wanted to do that, she could have added bacon to the omelette for only $.99!  Really, people?!  I feel like my wallet was violated for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Don't they already get enough of my wallet when I use the blasted Slot machines?


  The boyfriend ended up getting the breakfast bowl.  It came with scrambled eggs, hash browns, white gravy and a small biscuit on top.  My omelette was beautifully made, but completely and totally tasteless and bland.  I had to put more than four shakes of salt on it with pepper AND Tabasco sauce for it to even taste semi-desirable.  The boyfriend's meal was \"okay\" as he put it.  I didn't try a bite but taking a small taste of the biscuit, it was dry.  Apparently the gravy they used gave his eggs and hash browns a taste but that is more than likely the case because of the sodium content in it.  This is actually the reason why I'm giving Grand Cafe a two out of five stars - the breakfast food is so iffy, you may or may not even get something tasty!  

  Remember how I said I got an orange juice and coffee?  I mentioned that for a reason.  Because BOTH of these things cost us an extra $3.00 EACH.  Yes, you heard that right.  A three dollar cup of Joe. Bottom line here: always ask the waitress how much extras and sides cost and DO NOT expect a cheap meal here.  The family next to us in a booth ordered hamburgers and apparently, as I heard them tell their waitress, was phenomenal.  Too bad we didn't get a slice of that cloud 9 they were on because when we looked at how much we owed after all was said and done, we were very disgruntled.  Mercedes was a great waitress which is why I'm giving this Cafe TWO STARS instead of one.  

Visitors and hotel guests of Texas Station, go elsewhere for food!"}
{"text":"So thinking I'd get a quick breakfast bite to eat with my family for my birthday, we came here this morning. Huge mistake!! GARBAGE service!!! We were ignored by the waiters, not even offered a drink while we waited, and the wait was no joke, bout 20 minutes, which was long enough to observe the waiter serve a couple who had just arrived. Giving 1 star is 1 star too many for  their GARBAGE service!"}
{"text":"Typical of your big hotel lobby coffee shops. Open 24 hours, Keno, lots of choices.....unfortunately, the food is typically horrible and the service is typically poor. 

Understaffed seems to be the common thread with the restaurants here in Vegas. On the surface, they all are open for business but they all have severe cutbacks on labor. Makes for a long wait before and after getting seated."}
{"text":"We went for burgers today. They are so skinny like McDonald's now. We loved them before. This Cafe needs help. The quality of the food is cheap but the prices are high. It's bad enough that the casino takes your money so why wouldn't you have better food here. The last few times have been really disappointing. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Lets discuss.  
Hostess Rebecca is slow!!!  She accepted all patrons over the VIP patrons and has zero customer service skills.

Server Enrique:  AWESOME!  Very attentive, very polite, if you can ask for his section.  His helper tonight was Jo-Jo, she too was very attentive & prompt. Enrique did a lot of follow up on us, and always kept us informed.

Check Out:  two cash registers and one employee.  ThE Manager  \"Jill\" observed the line...doesnt offer to help her employee, and walks away attending to no one & stood at the bar and watched.  

The food:  chicken fried steak is HUGE!!!  Fell over the edges of the plate.  Taste was okay, needed some seasoning but a definite pleaser.  I will absolutely order this again. 

Chicken Noodle Soup was hot and tasty! Lots of chicken!!!

Lots of children - so ask to be seated carefully as you may end up next to toddler who throws food."}
{"text":"I can see why this gets 2 stars. And 2 stars is too high. Like a fool, I keep coming back. So, I am part of the problem. It's not like this is the only place I can get pancakes! 
Waited an hour on my wedding day to get pancakes and chili. Weird, I thought both of those are made already. Pancake batter? Check. Hot griddle? Check. Pancakes served to party of 2 takes how long? 15...20...maybe 30 minutes? Nope. Not here. Try ONE HOUR. SIXTY MINUTES for pancakes. And not just pancakes....COLD PANCAKES. wasted my time and did notify manager. Didn't really matter. Will not.....can not come back. Horrible. Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"This place is for sure hit or miss. When I come here after 11 pm it seems they have way too many customers and not enough servers. I try to stick to coming here for lunch or in the early evening dinner but after a concert or night out on the town this cafe is open 24 hours and has pretty good late night specials. While out with some friends and it being after 1 am we decided on coming here. 

We were seated right away but as usual because of the hour it was, there was just not enough servers and service was slow. The following prices are from the \"All-Nighter Boarding Pass Specials Menu\" so you will need to have your stations boarding pass handy. 

I had the \"2 Egg Bacon Skillet\" priced at $3.99. My bacon was burnt and hard as a red rock (pardon the pun tee-hee) so I passed on eating anymore of the bacon then what I already disgustingly ate. The eggs were good, the hash browns were good even though they didn't add the cheddar cheese I requested when ordering, and the sourdough toast had way too burnt grill marks on certain sides. They did bring the cutest little jelly jars to the table in grape and strawberry. I used one to try and cover the burnt taste of my toast but did keep the others. I figure I can make a PB&J sandwich with it at home which will taste better. My hubby had the \"Short Stack\" priced at $1.99, \"Biscuits & Gravy\" priced at $1.99and a side of sausage. He enjoyed his meal. The pancakes were actually really good and priced perfectly. My friends ordered the \"Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs\" priced at $4.99 and the \"NY Strip Steak & Eggs\" priced at $5.99. We like to sample each others and one of my friends said her chicken fried steak tasted sour. I tried a bite and it had NO flavor. The server was kind enough to remove the charge from the bill. We all shared a \"Tiramisu Cup\" and it was more like a custard with no flavor. 

That is all."}
{"text":"My BF and I came here for the late night special. He ordered the country fried steak and I ordered the steak and eggs. His order came out fine however my experience was not the same. Horrible customer service and blatant cutting corners due to laziness have made sure that I will not be returning. 

I originally ordered my steak medium with the eggs over medium. The first time my food came out the eggs were scrambled, which I let slide. However, despite the indicator stating medium the steak was severely well done. I sent the plate back to which I received no apology from the server, who seemed as though he couldn't care less. Within 2 minutes a gentlemen in a suit, presumably the manger, came out with a \"medium\" steak. Surprised at how fast this took, I took a look at the steak. From first glance, it was quite obvious that the steak had been sitting under a heating lamp for a long time. The steak was very dry with no juice when a fork was pressed into it. The fat on the trim of the steak looked like rubber, yellow with no moisture. At this point I sent it back and did not bother to order anything else not trusting them to get the order right. Until we left, we never received an apology from the manager or server."}
{"text":"After looking at the previous reviews, I'm wondering if perhaps there is more than one Cafe in the Green Valley Ranch Resort & Spa? 

Our server, Kristin, was amazing and we had a great conversation with her. There were many items on the menu that sounded good, but we decided to go with the daily special of T-Bone steak for $9.99 and a couple of side house salads. 

The bleu cheese dressing was delicious, the lettuce, tomato and croutons were crisp and fresh. The T-Bone steaks were prepared perfectly to each of our specifications (medium-rare for the hubby and medium-well for me...usually they can come out looking about the same, but ours were cooked to order). 

The dessert showcase near the register was gorgeously stocked with treats and we finally decided to get a frosted brownie to go. It was HUGE. And verrrrrrrrrrrrry chocolately and rich. 

We will definitely be back the next time we are in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"This is primarily for the service , food was fine ... We went in for dinner on Sunday 9/7/16, it wasn't real busy as there were empty tables throughout the restaurant . Our food server was a blonde lady by the name of Vicky Lynn (something like that) she took our order and that was it as far as conversation goes . 
She drops off our food, Burger / fries, steak /shrimp.. My husband likes ketchup with his fries and the dinky little squirt she brought him in a ramekin wasn't anywhere near enough .. She  proceeded to drop the plates off without saying one word , no \"is there anything else you'd like or need ?\" No \"if you need anything let me know \" NOTHING , NADA!! 
Never came by to check on us or refill drinks much less ask if we needed anything . Walked by us a million times but that was it, she dropped off food at the table next to us and my husband was trying to get her attention to get more ketchup and refills , no luck there , she drops the plates off picks up her tray and jack and poof! She was gone .. We got up to leave since she never came by with our check , as we were leaving we saw some friends said a quick hello, again she passed by us and said nothing , little did I know she was dropping off our check with the cashier. As we went to pay the cashier asked her for the check and all she said \" I left it right there \" pointing to the counter top, no \"thank you\" nada , not a flipping word .. We've had bad service once before with another waitress a few years ago and we didn't complain then we just left and didn't go back for a long long time , this time we complained and the Mrg Michael just seemed to make excuses for her and offered us the cheapest dessert they have , 2 chocolate covered strawberries , now keep in mind this server never said one word to us until she she saw us talking to her manager , then and ONLY then did she come up and apologized for her shitty service , I felt like telling her to F-off but I didn't , we just stiffed her and left .. That's it we're done .. We go out to eat and spend good money only to receive shitty ass piss poor service ! Yeah that's the last time we'll give them our business .. They don't care and they don't our business ... So just so you know this particular server sucks ! And btw I waited tables too so I'm a bit more patient than those who haven't !!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Grand Cafe a few times. Every time I'm staying at the Palace Station, I have to stop by the cafe. They have great specials! If you're a boarding pass member, you even get more for your money. I came here with some friends and Brian was our server. He was patient with us and super attentive. He was friendly and awesome to converse with. He's also really cute! I ordered the open faced turkey and it was amazing. Everyone else in the group was satisfied with their meal. We had a pleasant dining experience and left a generous tip for our server. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Service was excellent but the food was very bland. I got the spaghetti and meatballs plate and didn't like it at all. The flavor resembled spaghetti-o's. Expect obviously this plate cost more than a can of spaghetti-o's. 

My hubby got the Philly cheesesteak sandwich which also was very bland and dry. He had to ask for a side of au jus to dip his sandwich in to counteract the dry meat. 

Our waiter was excellent though feel like his talents are wasted here with the food being so mediocre."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast the other day, ordered chicken friend steak with eggs over medium. The food came out the eggs were scrambled my eggs never came out. I when the manger came over after 2 times of asking for her she was so rude old blond bi**h. Worst experience ever. Needless to say I will never go there again, I have never been talked to as a customer like that in my life, especially by a MANAGER."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! I went in last night around 1230am with some friends after we went to Red Rock to pay bingo. We wanted to try their midnight specials. Our Server DOUG was very rude. We all ordered from the midnight special menu, but he charged my friend the regular daytime price. Then when he brought it to his attention Doug said he would fix it, but charged him triple the amount of the regular price on his card because he was mad. My friend brought the receipt to the manager at the front cashier, and got it all sorted out. After the manager talked to Doug about it, Doug passed by our table and said something along the lines of \"You stupid mother fucker\" while not looking at us under his breathe. How unprofessional and immature can a person get? I've never been so disgusted with service in my life. I'm surprised how he even got the job or even still works there! Besides our horrible server Doug, our food came out after one hour and was not worth the wait. My food was cold, so it was probably sitting in the back for a while before he even brought it out. The restaurant wasn't even busy so I don't know why it took so long. I will never go back here again, and I advise everyone to never go here!

**EDIT: I forgot to mention that the same friend who got charged triple for his food, got his food way after we got our food. The table behind us both ordered what he ordered (only bacon,eggs,and hash-browns), and they got it before him and they were sat thirty minutes after us. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Late night specials such as steak and eggs is a staple for most local industry workers. Hands down the best you can get around the Vegas Valley; with great flavor and portions. The staff is always friendly so that's a plus. By the way... Not on late night specials... But... Their spinach and artichoke dip is TO DIE FOR!! :)"}
{"text":"The cafe isn't your typical Las Vegas cafe food. They have a great menu with a variety of food. (Lots of healthy choices) Had a great meal and great service from our server Tia..will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sat down for breakfast, a huge grasshopper, (size of a iphone) jumped near our table, waitress took care of it and said oh, we get a lot of these but none this big. Just gross, how many grasshoppers is normal at breakfast? Then a huge moth flew by ... gross just gross ... 

Only highlight were the syrupy pancakes ...."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast for the most part. At one point, I ordered food to go from the room. 

Their breakfast is somewhat inconsistent. I had various dishes from their Eggs Benedict to their regular 3 eggs with bacon, sausage and hash brown dish. Lately, I ordered a vegetable omelet dish. The omelet was runny and the cheese overpowered the eggs. It's kind of hard to pinpoint what it is that's lacking in their meals. I'm not sure if they entirely follow their recipes either. 

Moving right along, the French toast is decent, but their waffle is dry from the crust down the middle. Their pancakes a bit tasteless without the syrup. And the syrup has the consistency of water. 

The last we came, I actually returned a whole carafe of coffee. It tasted as if it came from the bottom of the barrel and cheap roast. But again, the previous days, the coffee was really good. 

The ambiance is nice, but staff are also inconsistent in attentiveness."}
{"text":"This place is not up to par when it comes to customer service. Quite frankly the worst experience my friends and I have eating at a casino-based restaurant. The food takes an unreasonable time getting to the table. The servers forget that they are waiting your table to go off and do other projects. There are a few times that they hit the mark but the cons outweigh the pros. I have been to this establishment more than enough times to formulate a proper opinion."}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here several times but the line is usally out the  door so I always end up going to the buffet. 

My bf got some comps here thanks to his playing craps we ended up going here around 8am there was no line so we decided to try it out. I ordered the Belgium waffle with a side of sausage patties, the waffle was delicious very moist and I loved that they served it with HOT syrup and enough of it to cover my whole waffle. The sausage was so gross I couldn't take more then the first bite first off it was beef not pork which I hate beef sausage and it tasted like rubber. I washed my food down with a mimosa which was pretty delicious. My bf got fried eggs pancakes and sausage links which he loved and demolished in 10 seconds. The service was also good as well I would definitely return here again I'm pretty shocked it only has 2 and a half stars I guess I went at the right time and ordered the right thing."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5, mid week Wednesday, 9pm. Entrees were fish and chips, Reuben, Philly Steak, Fried Chicken, and a Ribeye. There was not one good thing said from around the booth about any one of these meals. Waste of money, waste of time, should of headed into town a little further and stopped at The Peppermill. It would of been the same price, with much better food."}
{"text":"Looks nice when you walk in.  This time I was seated immediately after the last \"fake\" wait. 

It was dinnertime but I ordered the crab and avocado omelet.  Hash browns were nasty.  Omelet was overcooked and kind of dry.  There was supposed to be a sauce with it and there was a couple tablespoons of something like white gravy in the middle of the plate but not enough to fix the dry.

The waiter was fast, efficient and friendly so points there.

Honestly, the best thing about the experience was the hot tea!  I drink a lot of tea so I was thrilled the had chamomile because caffeine and I don't get alone and when a bigger than average metal pot was brought I noticed it was heavy on the bottom.  One of my big pet peeves is tea gets cold fast.  This didn't happen.  That pot might have been heated on the bottom and then had boiling water poured over the loose leaf tea (no tacky low-grade bags).  Plus, it wasn't a funky mug but a fairly decent cup albeit not as thin and delicate as traditional tea cups... but this made me happy.
Honestly, I would go there for a cup of tea!

Aside from the fact that it's convenient and I enjoyed the tea experience, I've had better food at IHOP for half the price."}
{"text":"TLDR: late-night specials on week nights, friendly service, bakery items to-go, moderately priced entrees otherwise

Grand Cafe is the only way the casino can function due to its 24-hour status. We frequent this location after 11 o'clock bingo or a late-night movie or boba run since it's close to home. Having been to other grand cafés, I'm happy to write this review to share my experience, food quality, and service provided. 

All of the servers work their butt off, including the manager who always wears a coat. My last experience was on a Thursday night/Friday morning at 1230am. It was the only time I'm ever waited in a line to be seated. The hostess/cashier/bakery attendant informed me that Thursday nights have been busier than the weekends and it's the day that's staffed the least. But since, it's the last day where you can get the late-night specials, it makes sense. 

My order varies based on my appetite, but I love breakfast so I can't resist anything with eggs. I usually order the All-nighter skillet: 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast for $1.99. What a steal? If I'm being an extra fatty, I pair it with a short stack: 2 large pancakes about 8 inches in diameter with a buttery residue...it's also $1.99. Sometimes I order the 1/2 pound classic burger with mayo, lettuce and tomato (no onions please) and it comes with fries...all for $2.99. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak for $5.99: 2 eggs, hash browns, 2 pieces of toast, and a large piece of chicken fried steak (about the size of 2 palms). It's actually pretty filling and doesn't taste half-bad. 

I'm really big on water and there filtered water tastes awesome. Refills are 80% consistent, but I drink so much that my expectations are low for refills, especially when my server is tasked with 9 tables. I'm pretty patient at this location and the free wifi helps. The one time I've had a problem, I brought it to the attention of the manager and my meal was free. Ever since then, I've always come and been served with respect."}

{"text":"We came here after watching Steve Wyrick's Magic Show on the advice of my mother who plays poker here. 

At 11 pm - the food was mediocre. My turkey club sandwich had processed luncheon meat. Big no-no!

I choose from the $9.99 + menu:
Caesar's Salad - good
Club Sandwich & fries - huge but disappointing
Chocolate Cake - my slice was literally gone in 3 slices of my fork

The rest of my party had NY steaks which they complained were chewy and rather rare inside. (yet they ate them!)

Best thing about this place was the fries and my bubbly waitress. First thing she says is \"your water is city water, it's thick and hard... it ain't good!\""}

{"text":"Food was pretty great, service and ambience not so much. I had the mediterranean turkey burger, which was sort of pricey I felt at ~$10, but it was good. Served with fries in an adorable little fry basket, but those seemed out of place in the trying-to-be-elegant cafe. I think the place is generally confused at what it's trying to be since it reopened. Like Louisa said, it is absolutely modeled after Cheesecake Factory, looking nearly identical to it with its tile work, chandeliers, and even the pricey menu for not that great of food. 

I've also had breakfast here, which I enjoyed better than the dinner, but the same problem with aloof service. Definitely not horrible but not what I would expect from GVR."}
{"text":"Ambience is really nice. The food is good, I had a philly cheese steak and it was great. The only downside I had was the cheese steak had a little too much onions. Other than that, it was great! My server was really nice and I had no problems."}
{"text":"Very bad service, waiter only came by to check on us 3 times since we sat down on our 3 course meal. Food was bland they need to learn how to spice the food. I think we had a rotten tomato in our food not good at all. When we where about to pay the line is so long it takes almost 25 mins just to pay for the food on top of that the lady leaves. Want good advice STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but they need more staffs we waited to be seated over 6 mins when there was no one. Also there are only 2 girls working the front and we had to leave with no one helping out in the bakery side. Work on customer service"}
{"text":"If you want grilled cheese, you come here! It's served with tomato soup with just enough spice to make it interesting.  I put in a packet and a half of sugar.  That really kicks it up a notch.  The fries are okay they cool off fast. I've had other things here too, burger, omelet, pancakes.  They used to have homemade chips and French onion dip but that's gone now and I don't know why. The food has always been good and the service is really friendly. It's open 24 hours and it's like an upscale Denny's, the prices are higher but I think it's fair for the quality of food. Also they have a variety of desserts and they are pretty and taste good!"}
{"text":"We ate here one night during our 4 day stay at Green Valley Ranch and I wish I hadn't...

The Better Half ordered a Turkey Burger w/Cole Slaw.

I ordered the Nachos, $9.25.

The Nachos were a waste of calories....a lot of calories.  The Cheese tasted like the yucky snack bar style Cheese and the Chips were stale.  I was starving though and for some reason (like when you eat crap like this at a ballpark) I thought it would taste better the more I tried....but it didn't.

TBH said her Turkey Burger was average.

At the end of the meal, we were pissed that we ate here.  It also didn't help when we had to flag down our server to fill our Wine and Water glasses during the meal.  There are so many other choices in the hotel....damn, next time we know better.

{"text":"Hmmm....Breakfast, one of my favorite meals.  When we're in Vegas, we enjoy coming here for breakfast.  It was a regular place for us when we lived here.  A couple of our favorite dishes are Eggs Benedict and the Denver Omelet w/Hash Browns.

The service is so/so.  We'll get great service about 60% of the time.  Usually the bad service is when it gets busy....It can get pretty busy in here, so the trick is to come between meal periods.

{"text":"Carmen the server was the best.  The food was great quality and the prices are great.  I enjoyed my omelette and coffee.  My boyfriend order pancakes which were the best pancakes I had in years.  I would be visiting again."}
{"text":"Seems to be a popular place. We went in for breakfast around 8am on a Sunday. There was only a few tables left and by the time we left, there was a line outside waiting for tables. 
Our server was cordial but did take a bit longer than I would have liked to come to our table. However, they did have a pre-server server come by almost immediately to take our drink order, nice touch. 
I had the eggs Benedict and they were okay. The hollandaise sauce had a stronger flavor than I liked, not sure if it was too much lemon juice, pepper or if they added mustard to it. Either way, I scraped some of it off so not to ruin the overall flavor for my taste. The eggs were done correctly and the hash browns were tasty. 
The guy with me ordered a side of sausage patties which consisted of 4 patties. Seemed like a good plate to order if you had a couple of people to share with. More than enough for one. They might want to consider just giving two of them and cutting the price in half to avoid the waste. 
Nice, clean place, decent pricing and good food. Probably a good place to go if you're not in a hurry to eat and run. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least a dozen times now always after 12AM for their late night menu. And every time I order the same thing: steak and eggs + pancakes. However, recently I was in for an unwelcome surprise when I ordered my usual menu item. The steak was so dry and ironically after I had praised the steak for being so good to the server and especially at the price point of 6 dollars. Moreover, they raised the price to $7.50 but the quality of the steak went DOWN!

I relayed this message to the server and she told me that they had to raise the price because they were losing money on the steak and eggs... but it's disappointing that they also lowered the quality significantly possibly by buying cheaper cuts. To find out if this was just a fluke, I ordered 2 more steaks on different days including tonight, and sure enough the steaks were dry and I had difficulty chewing despite having them cooked medium-rare. Very disappointing change.

Locale-
Located inside Red Rock Hotel/Casino, it has very nice decor with classy chandeliers and comfortable booths. The place is well designed and looks like a place that serves more expensive food.

Food-
Reading the other reviews on here, it seems my mediocre experience is the norm. Only a few weeks ago the steaks were great. I can't pinpoint exactly what has changed since I don't work there, but the quality change is objectively there. I've eaten quality steaks but I'm not expecting Grand Cafe to be like SW, Prime, or Gordon Ramsay. I just want my old steaks back that aren't dry despite being cooked medium-rare so I can have my late-night fix again. Otherwise I will have to consider Tuscany or some of the other steggs places in town.

Price-
The late-night menu is very good value. I wouldn't come here otherwise. I'm actually afraid to order something from the regular menu because if it's the same quality but more than twice as expensive, I don't think I could pay for my food considering my recent experiences.

Service-
I've always had a great experience. Fast, friendly, and accomodating. The manager once discounted our meal because they ran out of hashbrowns.

TLDR;-
Ambience- 4/5 (classy, well-designed, comfortable)
Food- 1/5 (I don't know what happened to my old non-dry steaks)
Service- 5/5 (fast, friendly, accomodating)
Overall- 3.3/5 (Not what it used to be)"}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel recently and tried this place and was pleasantly surprised. The food depending on what you order is average to very good depending on WHAT you order. The staff was pleasant the prices were good for those on a budget. I saw a big guy order the Macadamia pancakes (full order) and he maybe at a 1/3 because it was such a huge order. Unless you are sharing or starving order  the smaller stack. The prime rib and omelette's were good and the real deal is midnight to 6 am when they have some serious super savers on food.  ."}
{"text":"So, we just finished a meal here; we were in a hurry to find my niece anything to eat so the least busy place in Red Rock seemed a good choice, I mean how bad could they be.  Well...

As soon as we arrived and told a young hostess we wanted a table for 7 problems arose. My recollection was she said they don't seat parties of our size because they don't have the right table for us (put two 4-top tables together honey...geez). We agreed to be separated as 3 & 4 top tables but the hostess decided to seat people behind us who aren't t even CHAIRMAN first (3 groups to be exact); they were regular folk like us. It's possible the ropes to separate VIP guests and regular guests were demented, it made no sense till after we finished our meals.  I assume the more polished hostess, who just started her shift, fixed it and arranged the ropes wisely.


Anyway, a second hostess finally seated us (separately). i asked her why we couldn't be seated in a section where the tables were open; she replied that the section was close.  Wow!!! So you're telling me if a group of 20 walked in with money to burn you wouldn't  seat them because the section is closed. It's not like the section or tables were reserved, just that no server was assigned that area. GET A SERVER TO TAKE THE TABLE MANAGEMENT!  Where were you guys anyways?

Ten minutes after being seated I kind of took it out on our server, Debra, with a grumpy and sad attitude for our mishaps. It did take quite some time for us to be greeted at the table or get a glass of water, but I shouldn't have because she was a pretty decent person and server.  Debra asked how we were and I replied truthfully and said not so well. We told her the story and her reaction was what I'd expect most people in the industry to react...shocked.  I jokingly asked her not to do anything funny to my food (it really does happen people, I worked in restaurants; I'm not saying it happens here but just saying, you never know). Never complain about staff until after your meal arrives; God forbid you ever have to return anything to a closed kitchen.  Debra was a good sport though and a good server; she directed us to the manager-on-duty Kim a little later.

Meanwhile....
Right next to us, they were putting two tables together to seat 7 people. WHAT THE HELL! REALLY...Yup, slap #1 on us.  We told Kim about it and she was amazed that happened too.  We just gave constructive feedback for her to tell the hostess. She said she was going to give us a discount or dessert for what happened but that never really happened so I'll leave my criticism of Kim with a BIG FAT QUESTION MARK; who knows if she will even train the hostesses correctly and let them know of their poor performance. Besides, we don't care about freebies, although they're nice.  Just fix what needs fixing, please!  Anyhow, the 7 people that sat next to us were a perfect White American family so i had to ask if there was something wrong with us (you know, being minorities and all), at least she answered wisely.  It does bring about good questions about the incident though. Hmmmm....

My food finally came.  NY steak and eggs (MR, OE, S). The sourdough toast wasn't toasted; my steak was rare and just seared outside, and my eggs were over-medium.  Food was just OK; I wonder if they rushed it or the chef got annoyed with the hurry order. I wonder if they.....?

Meanwhile...
That closed section, miraculously opened. They sat 4 next to us there (slap #2) and 15 minutes later they setup for a 6-top in that same closed section a few tables over (slap #3).  OMG! It had to be us. Who knows, don't care!  This place bites.  I doubt it will ever get better.  Here's a thought, let's train our employees before we feed them to the lions; they're lucky they slapped a bunch of kittykats instead of lions who would have chewed them up and spit them out."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. We came here for breakfast and I ordered the breakfast bowl. It came with hash browns, four eggs (your preference), sausage with biscuit and gravy. Hash browns were cooked right crispy on the outside and soft inside. Eggs were ordered over medium. Gravy and sausage were good but biscuit came out cold. Coffee is light but still good."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it took forever just to get water!!!   I mean seriously.  Water?  How hard is that?  My wife had taken some medication and I specifically informed the waiter.  We notice three of them ran and hid in the back and I had to go to the front to complain!  I asked for a manager but they did not flag him/her down and still no water!  Although the food is good the service sucks!!!! And that is why I give this a single star."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good here and it is clean but the issue is the staff. They can be almost empty and they make you wait. They give you a half a glass of water or drink and NEVER refill it. They seem to be way understaffed. The staff also seems to be incompetitant. Interestingly the one at Sunset Station is just the opposite the staff is great but the place is not clean."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast after visiting the Redrock National Monument area up the road.    We had to wait for about 20 minutes in a noisy area of the casino reeking of second hand smoke.   Once inside the Grand Cafe, the service was excellent.   The decor and noise level were fine.   Our waitress was extremely friendly and left us with a whole carafe of coffee.    The breakfasts were ok.   I had a french toast sandwich, that sounded good, but I would not order again.    My wife had ham steak and poached eggs and that was good, but nothing special.    We probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Food was just OK, and service was just OK, too.  Ordered a coffee and it took way too long for it to arrive.  But it's a 24/7 cafe, so how good can you expect it to be, eh?"}
{"text":"I know that casinos, specifically local places, have bigger investments than dining. So basically there is no motivation to offer great food or service when the real draw is blinking and dinging a few feet away. This is definitely the case here. 

My parents and I brought my two toddler girls for dinner on a Saturday night, as we live close by and visit the buffet on occasion. It was not too crowded, and there was no wait. Being seated and brought drinks promptly was the end of the positives. My daughters were already pretty hungry and were being distracted with crackers, knowing that there would be a reasonable restaurant wait. Our server came and answered menu questions a bit begrudgingly. She committed our order to memory, and we agree that this meant it would not be right. That was accurate. Everything came out quite slowly, and no used plates were ever cleared before the next course arrived. When the entrees arrived, my mother and 3 year old's were not right and took a very long time to be corrected and delivered. The restaurant could not have known that those were the two people at the table who cannot wait to eat (mom for medicinal reasons, and daughter for toddler reasons), but that is how it landed. 

Beyond the service, the food was sub-par for the price. Salad was a standard diner iceberg, and my entree of shrimp and chicken was extremely dry and overcooked. As I inspected the chicken, the odd, random, differently cooked pieces started to resemble scraps at best or salvaged pieces from other people's plates at worst. After that thought came to me, I couldn't finish it. We had all ordered from a special priced 3- course menu, which included dessert. I chose the brownie, which came very dry and old-looking, completely different from the brownies in the case at the front. So they reserve cheap desserts for the meal special, rather than wasting their \"good\" pastries on them. 

We ate and it was fine. This place is no global travesty. But no thanks."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to grand cafe but me n mah friend HAD to eat something after a night of shinannigans. I ordered the Mediterranean frittata (it had egg whites, fresh sliced tomatoes, basil, and feta cheese). It was PERFECT  just the right size if you're looking for something  to fill your stomach and doesn't weigh you down. It also came with fresh toasted whole wheat English muffins which was a warm fluffy plus!!. Also we didn't want to wait so we ate at the bar-- the bartender who said she was new did a great job and we we were never left unattended. The food came out a very reasonable time.

What a great end to a fun night!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and we waited half an hour to get our food. McDonalds burgers are bigger and taste better than what they had to offer. Wanted a steak special but they were out of steak. Ordered a prime rib sandwich that ended up looking like a pulled pork sandwich. Spoke with the manager after waiting 15 minutes for the wait staff to find her, who treated us rudely. We never touched the food and left. We thought that a nice upscale hotel and casino would offer something better. We will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for breakfast during a work trip since was getting sick of the vegetarian breakfast wrap at Starbucks.

I ordered an omelette.  It was cooked a bit soft for my liking but overall, it was pretty tasty.  What really won me over though were the hash browns.  I live in the northeast now and everyone does \"home fries\" ... you can't get decent hash browns in the NY metro area to save your life.  The hash browns here were Awesome!!   Crispy but not burned.  Absolute perfection.   I'd eat here again for the hash browns alone.

Table service was also really prompt.  They took my order accurately and brought it to me quickly ... what more can you ask for?   I've only tried for breakfast, so I can't comment on other meals, but they had a nice breakfast menu and I loved my omelette and hash browns."}
{"text":"We generally go the the Grand Café when we're eating at Red Rock and today was no different.  I had the Southwest Chicken salad which has a great dressing with a lot of cilantro.  My other favorite is their California Cobb salad.  My wife had their Chicken Supreme sandwich and that's always good for her.  

The Café is pricey compared to some of their other in casino cafés.  Service can be tough, but we usually ask for Jose or Yuan.  They are both top notch and treat us well."}
{"text":"Stopped by here around midnight ish. I asked the 1st waitress if they had a drink menu. She said no. So I asked her what drinks do they have. She said coke and ice tea. The 2nd waitress comes by takes our order.when the food came out and before I could even be half way through my meal I was given the bill. I wouldn't recommend this place nor it's food."}
{"text":"I was there during a quiet after dinner time 8:30pm. We seated almost immediately, our host and waiter were very attentive. They enjoyed a small chat and gave some recommend on special items. 

Right now Grand Cafe having some food promotion. I ordered NY steak ($15.99) and Ham Skillet ($5.99-with player card) and the portion were large enough. The steak was made perfectly but was very blend and chewy. Better luck next time for me with maybe meatloaf or something else. 

The restaurant was cleaned, all hotel's cafe I dine are pretty much the same but this place definitely my first choice since most food are pretty decent. 

P.S. Next time will save some room for dessert. Those cupcakes and cookies look....so sexy for sugar rush."}
{"text":"**see grand cafe - green valley ranch**. this is for anthem."}
{"text":"The service for this place sucks so bad...waited in line for 30 min just for a table to be cleaned and there was 3 tables available but no hustle to clean them. Once I was seated we waited another 15 min before we got our drink order. From there it was another 15 min just ask for our order but looking down at a couple nxt to us they been waiting 20 min just for their food. With that said we paid for our drinks and left out. So a total of 1 hr just to get a drink. I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"Horrible service by Tiffany and Wayne. Literally waited  for over an hour so we could settle bill. The check we recieved, was different from what were charged, when we inquired as to why. We were meet with rudeness and no real response.  When I inquired as to why our check would be different when we had not received anything since we asked for check previously their response was this happens all the time. When I asked to get contact information so I could file a complaint, they said they were not allowed to hand out contact information. So ridiculous.Tiffany was fine at first before we received no service, including refilling water or asking if we were okay or needed anything else. Wayne should not be working  with people or in customer service. Just an all around bad experience, we normally have such a good experience from stations."}
{"text":"Of all the Grand Cafes on Stations properties, this is my favorite.  My favorite seat in the house happens to be outside, the round table nearest the pool area.  Last time we went here, they allowed us to sit outside even though no one was out there and still gave us decent service.

You can't expect some top notch menu but the food is still decent."}
{"text":"Well we came for the grave yard special and let's just say this, I believe they discount it due to the lack of service, we were seated and about 15 mins later the waiter comes and takes our orders then walks away 10 mins later he returns with water then he disappears roughly for the next 45 mins, are water has been long gone since and our food finally appears, well I ordered my steak medium, so imagine as I cut into my steak and it's a dark gray inside, the steak was rubbery and dry giving it a sense that it has been sitting under a heating lamp for quite a while. He sees our waters empty and says he will be back to refill them then disappears another 5 mins before finally returning. At which time I mentioned the steak he said he can get me another one but I said at this rate you'll be serving breakfast by then. Over all the food and the value is great but every time I come to the graveyard specials here the service takes well over an hour even when there's little to few guest in the cafe. I will say the manager did offer to take it off the bill which is great but I did eat it so I feel I should pay for what I ate the issue here was the rate of speed and not the food the steak was hard and rubbery but still edible. If you're looking for midnight specials I suggest driving a short 5 mins away to Rampart Casino, they have some really amazing specials for $2.21 plus a graveyard menu as well service there is prompt friendly and very welcoming."}
{"text":"Come here if you want a baby! A food baby of course. This place is 24 hours so if you have a late night craving this place can satisfy your needs and you can go right outside to table after.

I own a stations casino card and I come here for their deals such as the skillet for $5.99. The skillet contains bacon, sausage links, three eggs, biscuit covered in gravy and a sizable amount of hash browns. The only way to get the deals for this menu is if you order the entree with a drink.

If you order stuff off the regular menu, just be mindful it can get pretty pricy. Had ordered special waffles with fruits etc and came up to 20+ with a glass of lemonade. The waitresses are very nice and frequently stop by to refill drinks or ask if any other services were needed or just to check up on you."}
{"text":"I was staying at Palace Station for my trip to Las Vegas. I didn't have any dinner plans so I was wandering the casino trying to to figure out what to eat. I had friends who had just stayed at Palace Station back in the spring. So I asked them via text where they ate and what they thought of it. They mentioned how they like the Grand Cafe. I figured that I would give it a try. The staff was very friendly. My server, Mario, was very attentive. The food was decent. I ordered their rib special. The ribs were good, but not perfect. It came with some grilled corn on the cob, a grilled potato and some cole slaw. I ordered a side salad to help me feel less guilty about what I ordered. If you have no plans, the Grand Cafe is a wonderful choice for a meal. The service was good and the prices were very reasonable. If you have a sweet tooth, check out their dessert counter before you head back to your room or your hotel! It has a lot of great choices!"}
{"text":"I am very particular about my Chinese chicken salad, not that I think the Chinese actually came up with the dish. Anyhow, it's not on the menu here, but trust me when I say it is very tasty, fresh, and portion is just right. Our waiter was a bit..preoccupied. only towards the end did we see the corner of his lip curl up to smile. Hence, the four star rating minus one."}
{"text":"Came here at around one in the morning and had their breakfast platter. The ham steak was kind of tough but the rest of the meal was good. In general pretty expensive for a 24 hour cafe."}
{"text":"Food was good, however our server was terrible. I pointed at what I wanted and also said it out loud, somehow he got it wrong. He also never came back to check in with us and never refilled our water (until we were about to leave). Out of all the Grand Cafe's I've been to, this is one of the worst and I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a good, solid casino coffee shop. The interior looks swanky and is obviously modeled after the Cheesecake Factory. The food is good but is a little bit pricey ($12 for a chicken sandwich??) unless you stay for the cheap late-night specials. I've always had good service here and good, solid American food. 

The ice tea is brewed and is really good, but the drink glasses are small. I know they are supposed to look more sophisticated or whatever, but you really are at the mercy of your server to keep you well hydrated. 

The chili is awesome and has NO BEANS. A bowl runs around $6 and it's worth it. I eat it every time I come here. You can get the breakfast menu any time of the day. In fact, you can get the entire menu 24 hours a day. The desserts are freshly baked and tasty too; check out the dessert case at the counter when you walk in. 

I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here but if you are in the casino and need a sit down meal, this would be a great choice."}
{"text":"The food here isn't going to change your life (it likely won't even be memorable a few hours later), but the setting is lovely and the service is usually very good. This is a classic coffee shop with a streamlined menu of salads, sandwiches, complete meals and breakfast, all served 24 hours a day. 

The kitchen is inconsistent with their preparation and ingredients. I've ordered the chicken Cobb salad three different times and each time it is different! This last visit the chicken was really good, big chunks of fresh chicken breast. Other times it has been shredded chicken breast. Sometimes you get slices of tomatoes, other times you get cherry tomatoes or diced tomatoes. Just weird. At least the ingredients are high quality. The side salad even has freshly shredded carrots. Nice!

Remember, this is a tourist-based restaurant in a casino. That means prices are high! Expect the $10 range for a burger and the $13 range for a salad. They have a captive audience and they know it. They send out coupons to locals so that's why I eat here once in a while.

Check out the dessert case by the register for some good pastries that aren't (surprisingly) way overpriced. I have a hard time resisting them. They also serve my favorite: Illy coffee!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent for the price, but the service is not. 

My uncle and I came here this morning for breakfast. Although we were seated immediately, it took our waitress 10 minutes to take our order and 45 minutes to deliver it to us. 

We were not checked up on at any point during our meal, and ended up having to pay in cash because our waitress never came by to pick up the check.

Overall, good food, but a 0/10 on service."}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was nice.  The service was decent and so was the food.  It was my birthday breakfast after a night out, the fair did what I had hoped it would, fill me up.  Tonight was another story.  I filled myself up on iced tea because my idea of medium well and the cooks idea of medium well were very different.  Tipsy or not, cold pink meat is just not for me.  Still I'd probably eat here if I made it out to Red Rock.  Best for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm assigning this Grand Cafe three stars because I loved the Prime Rib Special when I stayed here between 1/12/16 and 1/16/16.The servers were good, although the cashier disappeared more than half the time. The Pancakes were dry and hard to eat but the omelet I had, Bacon/Swiss, was loaded with bacon and very good. The Bailey's Ice Cream Mudslide was out of this world delicious. 

My review is based upon an incident in this Grand Cafe on 1/13 which disturbed me. Although I initially published the details here, I decided, upon reflection, to delete my remarks because I made my point by venting and I do not want ramifications for others that I would not want for myself."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible from beginning to end.  Bad service bad food bad everything.  From watery syrup to coffee served in paper cups.  Do yourself a favor and go to McDonalds!  You'll be more satisfied then this place."}
{"text":"Red rock grand cafe. You are my best friend at the end of a night of debauchery drugs and makers mark. Late night eats to sober me up. I have a fever. And the only prescription for my fever is some chicken fried mutha effin steak for $7! Tah Dow! Even if I am eating alone at 1241 am on a Friday night. Grand Cafe, you're keeping my belly full and my body out of jail. Love You..."}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was TERRIBLE. So slow for one. On top of that, when the waitress brought our food out she stopped before she got to our table and talked to the bartender for minutes so loudly and animated. I could just feel her spit going all over our food. Very unprofessional. Don't want to go back and get the same waitress. 

With that being said the food is worth a try, but 1 star because service trumps food in my opinion."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time last night and I must say the restaurant ambiance is rather impressive for a 24 hr cafe.  I started with a side salad and then ordered the roasted herb chicken dinner with streamed veggies and a baked potato.   The salad was good, except it was 100% iceberg lettuce.  It would have been nice to have a spring mix or something.  It was a bit like a Denny's salad.  The chicken was very good and the 1/2 chicken was a larger bird, so it was a good sized meal.  The veggies were tasty and the baked potato was a bit dry, but OK.   The ambiance is very nice and service was good, but not outstanding.  My wine glass was empty the server never asked if I wanted another glass. Hello, it's Vegas and dinner time....one glass?  really?    The wine serving size was kind of small, but I would have ordered a 2nd glass if offered.  I like this place and it sure beats standing in the super long line for buffet or dining at the fast food court.   The bar area looks cool and I'll try that on my next visit.  Maybe I can get a refill on my drink there. lol  3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Last time I was here our waitress took our order right away . She quickly left and never saw her again. We were sitting there for 20 minutes no water just napkins in lap. Finally I wave down a busser just because I was so thirsty, right before he brings our drinks the food hits the table. Haven't even had a sip of water yet. So after about a half hour our waitress shows back up and asks if we needed anything . I ask for some condiments and she then just disappears ! I wave down the busser again to assist me. After I complained to the manager and he didn't discount anything off my meal, also said he would take off the forgotten bacon on my burger but never did. I then proceed to pay and ask for my players card back. They can't find it and guess where it was ? In the damn trash can after I watched the waitress pull it out and hand it to me. Terrible service, only come here for the late night special."}
{"text":"I'd give it a zero if I could.
Horrible service...45 minute wait on a cheeseburger, which btw tasted absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"sad to say the quality of service at this cafe was extremely poor. our server was nice but she kept getting our order wrong and everything took forever to arrive. just a cup of coffee took about 10 minutes to arrive. one of the burger we ordered had a long blonde hair in it that my cousin pulled out of her mouth. Jaclyn, the manager in duty did not care at all. she was very unapologetic and didn't offer to make it up to us. the manager also seemed very unhappy to be there at all and it comes through with her customer service. we spent $160.00 on a ok meal and mediocre service. we will never return to this cafe again. lesson learned you have been warned!!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here, even with the long line, I get it, it's like peak breakfast hour, so I'm not bitter about the wait, but here's my beef with this place, the line isn't only to get a table, but expect double the wait for the food to even show up at your table.

We waited about 20 mins to get our booth, we waited about 10 mins to place our order, we waited 35 mins to get our food! Thank god there was Keno to keep us occupied, otherwise I would have been really pissed off. The waiter apologized profusely for the kitchen staff, I guess they were behind, yeah no shit! I'm starving over here.

The food, was good, but I wouldn't wait that long for breakfast, not here at least.

Should have gone to the buffet, line was about the same and at least we can just go get whatever we want, whenever we want. Fail."}
{"text":"Recently I ate breakfast with a group of friends.  Our server was very friendly and he is the only reason there is two stars.  I asked for hot tea with no lemon.  Another server whos job is only to bring drinks brings me a plate with lemon and honey and a small pot with my tea.  Before setting the tea pot down he bangs it on the table several times.  Not sure what that was about.  After waiting for over 25 minutes our food finally arrived.  My friend asked me to taste his steak because he thought it tasted funny.  I didn't even put the bite in my mouth the steak stunk! It was rotten!  The server even smelled it and cringed.  How could the cook not smell that while it was cooking.  The smell lingered in the area even after the plate was taken away.  I will never eat there again.  Although the server apologized no one from management apologized to us.  Not what I expect from Red Rock."}
{"text":"Service is slow been there 5 times in the last year nothing has changed don't recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"How does a place charge a $4 service fee for a to-go order? I went with a couple of friends, had dinner, and my roommate wanted me to grab him something to go. The bill comes and there's this line for a service charge. \"What's this?\" I asked the cashier. \"Oh, did you order something to go?\" \"Yes... what does that have to do with it?\" \"We started charging extra for to go orders\" he says. I ask \"what extra service is there when you put the same food in a styrofoam container as opposed to on a plate?\" He has no response and I ask to speak with a manager. She's rather snippy and says along the lines, \"corporate makes us do this\" and \"There's nothing I can do about it. The cooks have to put together the to go orders and it costs $4 extra.\"

Now, I'm not the type to pinch pennies, but I couldn't justify paying this silly \"service\" charge. So, I took the container for the order out of the bag and handed it to her and said, \"never mind, just take it off the bill.\" 

Extra poor judgement by both management and corporate. Customers feel fleeced over something as trivial as that."}
{"text":"love coming here. ambience is great! service is okay and friendly staff.its the most upscale station casino property. family loves coming here to chill and eat."}
{"text":"Sufficient breakfast with my boyfriend and parents. We all got the 2-egg breakfast special ($3.99) and coffee (I think it was also $3.99) which was enough food for each of us. We probably had to wait 30 min for a table but once we were seated everything was quick. The food wasn't like amazing or anything but it was great for what we paid and it was easy and low-key."}
{"text":"turkey club overpriced, turkey was very dry, service today was not great for not being that busy. 

fries are not generous at all."}
{"text":"I always have great service whenever I'm here! They have a delicious menu my favorite casino cafe by far! 

The restaurant itself is a great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. 

I totally recommend the bleu cheese crumble salad, house chili, crab avacado omelette and of course the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!!!! My fave!"}
{"text":"I come here everytime I am in Las Vegas.   They have been open for 5+ years and this was the best food & service I have ever had.  Great job Tina!   (dang, I forgot to post this from a long time ago)."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Prices are more then fair.  The waiter was lousy.  Had to constanly ask him for another cocktail or to take our order.  He made what we were hoping to be a nice quiet meal one that was not as nice as it could have been"}
{"text":"This year, not so great.  Ordered the prime rib medium rare.  It came-out rare.  Sent it back.   A totally new plate came-out medium well.  And, it was chewy beyond belief.  Next morning, had breakfast there.  The food was good.  However, breakfast cost as much as the previous night's dinner.  I give up on this place."}
{"text":"This is GVR's version of the 24 hour coffee shop. The prices are reasonable, the portions no overwhelming, and the food pretty good. If the line at the buffet is out of control, walk around the corner, and you will almost never see a line. I should also mention the full bar. Worth a stop in. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Dined at 4 am and had the $8.99 sirloin steak and egg special that came with crispy hash browns and buttered toast. Good deal!

We try not to dine here late night or early morning night because it usually takes 35-45 minutes in and out. This is not a fast food joint, I understand. Something always snags the time away, be it the server or cook seems to take a while. Once our order was in, the food seemed to come out fast this night. Patrons all were happy, drunk and decent.

Like the bakery display cases at the entrance. Beautiful."}
{"text":"Been here two times and each time was a great experience. 

Great atmosphere, and especially greater prices if you are a boarding pass member, you get a special menu after midnight which has dirt cheap deals. Me and the fiance got a NY steak/eggs, short stack of pancakes, a country fried steak, toast, and sodas for less than $20. We tipped more than 20% because the service was pretty good and we took a table for an hour and ordered specials.

Please note that this should be considered far from fine dining, so please don't barge in expecting a five star restaurant with all the accommodations. If you take it for what it is, then you'll be satisfied and your wallet will thank you.

Alfredo was our server tonight. He was very nice, and never let our drinks empty."}
{"text":"I ate here after browsing around the new Downtown Summerlin shopping mall, which is conveniently located right across the street from the Red Rock Hotel & Casino. Despite living in Vegas for the past 8 years, I've never eaten here.

The aesthetics of the cafe were pretty well done. The cafe didn't feel dirty at all. It felt \"premium.\"

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a $9.99 T-bone steak special. We got two of those, plus the daily special of stuffed pork chops and a cheeseburger. The steaks came with mashed potatoes and assorted vegetables and were cooked to medium rare perfectly. The stuffed pork chops came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The burger came with fries.

All of the food was pretty good. Nothing tasted frozen (except the fries, which obviously were). The portions were pretty big.

When we got there, our waitress was attentive. When our waters came without lemons like I asked, she noticed and quickly got lemons to us.

However, I do have to dock them 1 star because I asked for a baked potato for my steak, but I got mashed potatoes. I didn't want to make a big deal since I like them both. They would have probably corrected the mistake had I told them about it.

If the cafe still has the specials, especially the T-bone steak special, I'll keep coming."}
{"text":"I love this cozy spot inside of the Red Rock. I like to come here to enjoy brunch and have a nice drink at the bar while watching the big flat screen tv. Today I enjoyed a crab and avocado omelette, sourdough toast and hash browns. They have the cutest little personalized jars of jam to spread on your toast which was adorable. The omelette was delicious in addition to my margarita on the rocks! Cool conversations with the employees at the bar was fun too. This place is perfect for a nice solo breakfast or lunch and I especially love to take out of town friends here."}
{"text":"They are sort of a hit or miss. Unfortunately they have missed with us too many times. Lose the late night menu station casinos has. GVR is close to the house so a natural, right? Wrong, never sure when we will find them open. Even called once and given bad info. Had one really great experience, great server, extra toast, unlimited marmalade....every other time was a disaster. The put us in a table which is almost totally enclosed and forgot about us. Little farther to drive and not quite as upscale but sunset is always consistent...and open."}
{"text":"Eck!  That's one word to describe this place.  At 11am (check out time), there was about a 30 minute wait.  Our waitress was apparently too good to bring water because she only brought the drinks other than water.  For my family who was majorly hung-over and in desperate need of hydration...this was not a good thing.  When she did bring our drinks, she didn't bother to take our order.  Another 5-10 minutes pass and she finally takes our order.  The water came via bus-lady about 5 minutes after that.

The food took forever too.  I didn't time it, but it had to be at least 20 minutes.  My mushroom, spinach, Swiss cheese (on top instead of inside), and I added ham, omelet......was mostly egg and spinach....I barely saw/tasted any mushrooms or ham.  For $9, this plate was served with hash browns and choice of bread.  The apple juice was SO sweet I had to add half my water to it.  

The menu is a wide variety of breakfast items, sandwiches, dinner entrees and even Asian Cuisine.  My cousin got the Emperor's Won-Ton Soup which was full of won-tons, bbq pork, veggies, shrimp........and bland flavor.  Remember, you are in Vegas, not SG. 

The waitress did come back to check on us a couple times, but it was already too late to win more stars from me since the food took too long.  Breakfast for 4 cost about $50...not too bad considering you're in a casino.  But the low prices reflect the poor service and poor food.  

Don't eat here unless you have no choice.  I'm not giving them 1 star because I can imagine worse things happening at a restaurant.  I'll save my 1 stars for them."}
{"text":"So I went to the grand cafe in redrock as I have many times.  The usual wait in line for a Saturday as to be expected which was no problem.  However, once in the lady that brought the beverages didn't say a word other than asking what we would like to drink.  Next, our waiter VINCENZO came to offer to take our order and he was very nice and personable.  He is a new addition and he is great for the grand cafe .  Ok so we waited for nearly an hour for our breakfast which my daughters was not completely cooked.  My hash browns had a hair in them which I ignored because we already just had sent back her omelette.  I didn't eat my omelette because it was like eating a mouthful of slime.  So I decided to try the pancakes instead which also had a hair in it!!!! I was done.  This restaurant changed their menu and it is less than desirable.  My boys however did enjoy their scrambled eggs and sausage with French toast.  You can get much better food much cheaper elsewhere.  Two stars because the waiter Vincenzo was good."}
{"text":"Why do people wait on line to eat at this place?  Is it for the cheap Boarding Pass specials maybe? The food quality has gone way way down over the past year, the portions have shrunk on most items, yet the menu prices have remained the same or higher. Went in the other nite, and orderd the fish and chips and an add on wedge salad.  Salad was a tiny chunk of lettuce, with a few cherry tomato halves, crumbled bacon and dressing. Small and really not worth the extra 2.99.  The fish and chips, was horrible, it was supposed to come with cole slaw, but the waiter insisted that it did not and would be extra (not true) he finally and reluctantly brought it. The fish was over fried frozen fillets. the insides were a dry mess.  Perhaps that is why service is slow, they take extra time to dry outyour food.  Not a good experiance, wont go back.  Stations, wake up and get some decent quality food on your menus!!"}
{"text":"Food here is good for the price. They have great deals if you have a boarding pass. They have a great late night menu from 12am-6am must have a boarding pass to use that menu."}
{"text":"I've reviewed the Grand Cafe before, and never dreamed that this time I'd be giving it 4 stars.  Either they've improved, or we just happened to get lucky tonight.  

They've been heavily advertising their cafe specials, even on TV.  The board right outside the restaurant listed their special 3.99 burger, and a 9.99 steak and shrimp deal.  But the extra menu we got when we were seated had one more:  a half-slab of baby backs, also 9.99.  Since I haven't had ribs in a good couple of years, I went for that.  Mr. G, ever the bargain hunter, had the burger.  And it was a big, thick, juicy burger on a big, thick, shiny bun.  With a ton of fries that were very well done, as he requested.  

The ribs were as meaty as any I've ever had, and tender.  Not fall-off-the-bone tender, but soft, flavorful, and not dried out.  Medium-spicy barbecue sauce didn't drown them, but there was just enough.  Two small pieces of corn on the cob and a big baked potato, with a small cup of cole slaw rounded out the dish.  

Our waiter, Alfredo, was efficient and obliging, and I couldn't be happier with tonight's dinner at the cafe.  I hope the trend continues."}
{"text":"The last two times I've been here the food has been meh ..not really good and the service non existent. I know this place can be good because I've witnessed it a long time ago. I don't know if I would ever come back based on my past two experiences. 

The first time the bread on my Roast Beef Sandwich was a bit hard and they forgot my mayo. I didn't mind it much but the Guacamole that they served with my husband's quesadilla was gross. It was really brown ... we were trying to send it back but we were only checked on when they served us the bill. 

I decided to give this place another try a couple of days ago and we ended up walking out. We waited about 10 minutes for a seat . When we sat down my husband's side of the booth was still sticky like it hadn't been cleaned. We thought we would just let the waiter know when they come to take our order for our drinks. The waiter never showed up so my husband asked a worker up front if they can please have someone clean our table and possibly get us some drinks. They said \"Sorry it's too busy ..there is nothing we can do\". We ended up going to Rubios instead. 

I just read today that Station casinos is looking to hire 1000 workers for new Grand Cafe locations. I just hope they add more people to staff this location because clearly there isn't enough workers to provide a good customer experience!"}
{"text":"I don't why there are so many bad reviews of the Grand Cafe. Went there on a comped stay at Red Rock and had some fantastic food for both dinner and breakfast. For dinner try the prime rib. It was a huge portion and was sooo good. For breakfast I had a New Mexico omelette with avocado. It was amazing.Both of our servers were super nice ladies who loved our daugheter.  I am postulating that most of these bad reviews come from people who are pissed after losing at the casino and take their bad attitude to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here on our way to Red Rock Canyon for a quick breakfast. We fully expected it to be like the casinos on the strip (expensive and not very good). We were totally surprised. We had great food, great service and the price was pretty decent. The resort itself looks amazing and we may stay there next time."}
{"text":"We got there just in time because there was no line on a Saturday at 10. We chose to sit at the bar and Aaron waited on us. Pleasant guy- good service. We must have come here on a good day because the reviews on Yelp are pretty bad. 

My bf ordered the $3.99 breakfast special - 2 eggs, bacon toast hash and he also ordered a smoothie. I ordered the California omelet which was delicious. It had mushrooms, sliced tomatoes and goat cheese. Mmmmmm! I didn't have any complaints. Food came out hot and pretty fast. 

Food is slightly overpriced (Station really needs to drop the crappy \"We Love Locals\" garbage because.... They don't!!) they don't even let locals into the pool even if you want to pay!! But other than those minor gripes, this cafe met my expectations."}
{"text":"Had a family luncheon at this place, first time here and it was ok.  The food was not bad, the staff were all warm and friendly.  It is a cafe like most others, they have a decent variety to choose from like most other cafe's and they are not bad but it is also nothing spectacular which does not make this a bad place so please do not get me wrong.

We enjoyed our time here, the staff was very attentive to our needs for food and drink and even helped with taking a few family pictures for us when we were done.

This is a good place to eat if you are looking for a meal with a decent price.  I would come here again if in the area and looking for a place to eat.  I would recommend this place but like I said it is like any other cafe you will find in town especially at a casino."}
{"text":"The food here is your average cafe fare - salad, sandwiches, burgers, entrees. All around $8-15. Nothing spectacular, just solid cafe food. However the service is extra slow, it took 20 minutes for our waiter to take our order and at least another 20+ for our food to come. We were STARVING by the time food arrived. Wasn't quite sure why it was so slow as we ate around 10 pm and there were maybe a handful of customers besides us. 

They do have a very delectable looking dessert counter with an various desserts behind the glass, but I managed to refrain from getting any. Not as tempting as the slot machines and table games :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner Sunday night,,,,bad service  hostess had to wait to long to be seated had sliders for dinner ,,,cold,,never will eat here again"}
{"text":"Needed a place to eat pronto and this place was one of the few that we passed while we were in the casino.  Its your average 24hr cafe in the casino serving breakfast all day.  

They had a lot to choose from, but I was unsure since I didn't pick out from previous reviews what is the go to on the menu.  I somehow passed Prime Rib, and had immediately made my decision to order it.  

Prime Rib, for the price, was not bad.  Its a rather large piece as a matter of fact.  I couldn't even eat it all.  BUT, its probably because I had about 1 and 1/2 pieces.  I'll tell you that because when the first Prime Rib was delivered, it was cold.  I was so hungry and didn't want to flag down the waiter, I figured, let me just bite into it and deal with it.  Nope, I couldn't.  It wasn't cold as in frozen, just I think it took a while to get to my table.  So, I did eventually flag down the waiter, asked them to warm it, but my waiter kindly gave me a new serving.  It was hot, it was more on the medium I ordered it at, and I was satisfied.  It was served with sides, I got fries and veggies.  The veggies are frozen type, so we all know how frozen veggies taste like, bland.  

Not the best food experience, but the staff here was genuinely pleasing.  Okay for late night eating when you got the munchies.  Again, it is a Cafe."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting worse and worse.  Get there after 5 pm and expect a half an hour wait to get a table while the restaurant is HALF EMPTY.   The food is okay, but the service is absolutely terrible.  It will take you another hour and a half to eat because of the delays from the service staff and kitchen.  Don't be fooled by the $9.99 three course meal deal signs that show crab legs. The best you can do for $9.99 is spaghetti and meatballs.  The small portion of prime rib will cost you about $15.

They aren't offering any cheap Vegas specials, like you would expect from a casino - so I don't see why they can't seat and serve people in a reasonable amount of time.  You are better off going to the chain restaurants across the street for better food and better service for about the same price."}
{"text":"The bad reviews on this page almost made me pee my pants I was laughing so hard because they are soooo true Gordon ramsy to the rescue please!!! So we wait and wait and wait some more just like everyone else for clearly no good reason. About 15 mins for drinks food didn't take that long to get but upon tasting my food I new why. I think my hamburger patty and fries were reheated and old all our food extreamly overpriced very bland well just gross. My daughter loved her bowl of mac n cheese which made me happy because she never realized  her deep fried mac n cheese bites she ordered never came. Victoria our server was alright but the hostess krisstina needs to severely get over herself and maybe not b!tch at the servers in front of customers while we're finally getting served also sorry krisstina that we weren't good enough to ring out either but thanks for taking the people behind us and for walking away to leave us waiting after you were done! This place sucks! Typical Vegas..."}
{"text":"We must have been lucky in our timing.  We were seated within 5-10 minutes and had a delicious meal of fish tacos and a yummy burger.  We loved our meal and decided to come more often since we live close-by.  Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals.  My friend and I commented during our meal that this Cafe must have a great chef!"}
{"text":"You would think that when you get seated & the hostess hands you a menu & says your waitress will be right over, you would at least have your beverage order taken...me should know better. After 18 minutes of being ignored,  my wife & I said BYE-BYE. Told the cashier that we were totally dissed & she did NOTHING about it. This isn't the first time this has happened at a Grand Café. I started thinking I was truly invisible but it has happened at Santa Fe & also Red Rock. I swear I must be wearing a sign on my back that really says that I am invisible."}
{"text":"Still here. Coffee cups and water have now been empty for over five minutes. 
Server walked away after we said we were ready to order, came back after 2 minutes. 
Food arrived, still no refill.
Not impressed at all.

Bacon is nothing special. Denver omlet is satisfactory  

Eight minutes, no refills. 

At nine minutes, water and coffee arrived. Coffee was in carafe this time and we poured it ourselves. 

Better service and food at Egg Works or Blueberry Hill.

Trying to get a water refill. Manager helping to clean table next to us...water glass on edge of table. After six minutes server FINALLY asks if everything is OK. I respond clearly not while pointing at the empty water glass. He asked if I wanted a refill.

Could learn a ton from Pantry at The Mirage, the best breakfast in Las Vegas is at Pantry.

Water empty again. It is not that busy. Seven minutes. Now we only want to pay the bill and leave.

Very disappointed. Grand Cafe at Green Valley Ranch is significantly better."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed for this cafe in place station casino because the server is very lazy and the steak and egg it is very dry. We are not the special price it is the full price. And when we waiting for 20 mins to order  the steak for rare but after half an hour to came out. The steak is taste like well done. Inside is pink but the steak taste very dry and like well done. I think the steak under the warmer for long time so~
But and other crazy think it is the gave me a hot tea and other pot for the hot water but the tea pot they use the plastic to go sauce cup to cover it are you   Kidding me. I hope no more next time."}
{"text":"my nephew had chicken and waffles he said they were amazing. I had French toast bacon and eggs a regular American meal. my eggs were a little runny but my French toast was delicious my sister had a country skillet. I would rate this place at 3.5 but not quite a 4. The food was not terrible but it was nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Don't come here for breakfast. You'll wait 20-30 minutes for your food and the food has no flavor, specifically the hash browns. They are soggy and taste like just an uncooked potato. Denny's has better hash browns. And their eggs Benedict isn't all that great. Hollandaise sauce is flavorless as well. Ask for extra ketchup and drown it in salt and maybe you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent. All the Grand Cafes have special late night menus with good deals on breakfast items like steak and eggs. Nice after a late night of drinking or gambling."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Saturday night. Greeted right away and ordered a beer and asked for a menu. 
Beer came right up and I quickly ordered the nacho appetizer, no beans no olives.

15 minutes later a plate of nachos with mounds of olives comes out. \"Sorry but I asked for no olives\" no problem let me take it back.

Another 15 minutes and a correct but dissapointing looking plate comes out. I ordered the nachos because the guy next to me had them and they looked grejustat.

Now after 30 minutes I was hoping these would be awesome, unfortunately they just werent. Shredded chicken with no seasoning. 
And the cheese was just nacho cheese sauce so can't even blame the time on melting cheese.

I'll stick to yard house"}
{"text":"I ordered an eggs Benedict with spinach and tomato and asked for the eggs to be runny.  The benny arrived topped with an abundance of Hollandaise sauce with a large portion of hash browns on the side. The Hollandaise sauce was very good, but the eggs were overdone and the thinly sliced tomato added nothing to the taste profile. My wife settled on a vegetable omelet that included both toast and hash browns. Overall, neither meal was better or worse than fair though our server proved to be a delight."}
{"text":"I come here once in while with my boyfriend for steak n eggs @ midnight. It's a place where you can talk and wait for the food to come. If you are very impatient then this is not the place for you. The service doesn't suck. You just have to wait more than usual. Keep in mind this is not a fast food restaurant! The food is great. All employees are very nice. I've never had a problem coming here."}
{"text":"Services is good. 

Food is a complete different story.. 

My Sunday special: chicken cordon blue was not completely cooked. No wonder it tasted kind of chewy, and harder to cut..
I sent it back! Guess from now, I need to watch all their chicken dishes I order in the future."}
{"text":"I have heard friends & neighbors complain about the service at this cafe. But wanting to give them a chance, we had dinner here tonight. What atrocious service! The waiter did not offer us the salad that came with the meal. I had to ask for it since I had the same meal at Sunset Station. Not only did the food take forever to arrive, but the waiter forgot the salad! I had to ask for it again! The other order was a simple hamburger, which was so dry that my husband almost choked on it! Even MacDonald's would do better! The evening was, needless to say, ruined by the poor service & food that took too long to arrive (over half an hour). As we left, another party also walked out because their food had not arrived over half an hour after ordering. Head over to Sunset Station's Grand Cafe. The service there is top notch and the food seems better, too!"}
{"text":"Waited to be seated for 5-10 minutes . Said 7 adults , 1 kid . Got seated & had to ask for high chair ! Our servers name was BENJI . While taking our order , he was rushing us to order. NO Customer Service as well . I worked in a Restaurant like this as well . & I know how to give customer service . No thank you or your welcome after taking out order or after we said thank you. Employees are always smiling.

General Manager came to communicate for a bit , very nice gentlemen . 

Onion rings came out first , onion rings was good ! Thumbs up ! My neice got her cereal , she said she loved it . 

Fruit cup: Very pretty presentation ! A+ ! 

My food finally came out , I ordered a cheeseburger with avocado , and ranch for dip sauce , I give this delicious food a 110% A+ . 

Everybody said there food was delicious ! 

The only thing I prefer for Benji to work on is saying \"Your Welcome.\" To his customers who says \"Thank you.\" Overall I give this restaurant a 5 star because the food is very awesome ! 

The food came out at the right time , we didn't over wait . 

Got our check , went to the front , the front lady RENE , had NO greeting towards us , especially when we first walked in No \"Hi welcome!\" No welcome greeting. What so ever ! She needs to be thought about what CUSTOMER SERVICE is . 


I recommend it to everybody to come here anytime of day or night . 

Thank you for your service !"}
{"text":"I have been here now a couple of times and both were very late at night. We were in need of something to absorb all the free drinks we had the hotels center bar.
It was never a problem being seated. There is not much going on at Red Rock at 1am since Cherry closed.
I had a burger & fries one time which was really good and another time I had steak & eggs..which was also really  good.  Not a bad cut of meat.
And after midnight they have some really good deals on food. Some items are 2.99..like the burger & fries."}
{"text":"I actually come here for their steak and veggie for like $10. It is usually cooked right and the meat is not bad quality. The veggies are steamed and are squash and broccoli which I like. Honestly, for $10 and you don't have to waste time cooking it. Can you beat it with a ugly stick? I sure can't. Service is good and feels too notch. Better than the 2-3x as much John Cutter, for 1/3 the price. The servicio that is. I bet if they sold ribeye here it would be just as good."}
{"text":"While the food is good, it is costly and incredibly slow.  Don't try to use the Yelp! coupon as they have found an excuse on 3 different occassions to not honor it.  When questioned about this the manager becomes indifferent and even suggested I call the F&B director."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs were 3.5 stars, and the friendly & attentive service from Margie (from Brooklyn!) edged it to 4 stars

The coffee strength is inconsistent here.  Sometimes you get an overly bitter batch.  Today we had a lighter batch.

-Smoked salmon Benedict.  Benedict sandwich was tasty but a little sweet.  The hash brown were cold and greasy.  Fruit cup was fresh and a nice salad.

Kids said:
-banana foster French toast 5 stars!
-Belgian waffles without the caramel sauce was 3.5 stars, but add the warm caramel sauce from the banana foster and it's a 4."}
{"text":"We usually visit the Palace Station at least once when we visit Vegas.  This time we came with a $10 off at Grand Cafe offer through the myVEGAS slots online game.  It was late night and we were quickly seated.  Only a few other tables were occupied.  Our server was a young lady (I believe her name was Kassandra) who was friendly and attentive.  I had the huevos rancheros which was good but not great.  My husband however loved his corned beef hash with hashbrowns, eggs and english muffin.  He said the corned beef hash was cooked perfectly crispy like he likes it.  Good meal.  Good service.  I'm sure we'll return."}
{"text":"Looking for a late night snack and not sure what is open? Well guess what this café is! Open 24 hours I believe because I ate here at 3AM and they were still serving food! I ordered their steak and eggs. Ordered my steak medium. It is well seasoned. Love my eggs sunny side up! Servers are great and always topped off my drinks. Food came out in a reasonable time. I enjoyed my experience here and would not mind coming back if I ever get hungry near the area."}
{"text":"This review is based on oatmeal only.

Dined alone, place is packed at 10am Saturday morning, but only five minute wait to be seated. I was in a time crunch to get a shuttle reservation at 10:40, my waiter tells me there is at least 15 min wait for food and suggests the oatmeal is quick, I say ok because I really shouldn't be eating bacon and pancakes anyway. Probably waited almost 15 mins for the oatmeal anyway, it was horrible. The flavor of bland plastic and chemicals comes to mind, its total slop. Dried cherries and brown sugar are the ONLY thing saving it and helping me to choke it down so I'm not starving until lunchtime. Mimosa was decent. Even though I am aware they are really busy the service is still unacceptably bad and its obvious that is bad for every table. Took way too much time to swipe a credit card when the register was practically next to my table and the waiter was standing there the whole time. At least I didn't spend a lot of money on a depressingly unhealthy meal.

The breakfast foods walking by, pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs, huge fried chicken slathered in gravy, all looked good but I'm not so sure they really would be. Just don't get the oatmeal and don't go here if you are in a hurry on a Saturday or Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Went in here at 735pm. Took 15 min to get our drink/food orders. It was already 820. And our food still didn't arrive. 
So I saw a lady in a different outfit and asked if she was the manager. She said yes. So I told her we waited about 45 min and I said I was willing to pay for our drinks and desserts we had ordered. Just to cancel the food. And she said she will pay for our things. But even then. We just left. We didn't wanna be a bother or take advantage of them. Tipped $7 bucks for being nice at the end. Manager was really great. :) but terrible time on everything :) good food."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Went to dine in but the waitress Dee was so rude!! We ended up getting Togo and they gave me the wrong order!!"}
{"text":"While I like a good bargain, I can be a bit of a food snob and am instantly skeptical when I am served a huge plate for under $8. That was my initial thinking when I sat down for breakfast at the Grand Cafe in Palace Station earlier this month, but I was glad to be proven wrong.

The food here goes beyond expectations given some might dismiss Palace Station as an off-strip \"budget resort\", and immediately deride its restaurants. But the breakfasts at the Grand Cafe are not only delicious, but will keep you stuffed until late afternoon.

I was instantly tempted by their \"stacks\" selection of five buttermilk pancakes that come in an assortment of flavors such as Maple Pecan, Banana Caramel, and Macadamia, Coconut and Banana for only $7.99. I eventually settled on their S'mores pancakes and was not disappointed. My dining partner tried their house specialty, Bananas Foster French Toast, which was equally priced at $7.99 and equally pleasing and gluttonous.

The cafe is open 24 hours a day and serves inexpensive meals that go a bit beyond what one might expect from standard cafe fare: a soup of the day served in a sourdough bread bowl, a Turkey Cobb Roll, BBQ Beef, and a selection of tantalizing desserts from their pastry case. Not wow wow wow amazing, but at least they're trying.

They also offer a number of deals such as a two-egg breakfast for $3.99, and daily lunch and dinner specials for under $8 including a Pot Roast Monday and Chicken Parmesan Thursday. Given the quality of their offerings and their value, I will definitely not shy away from these tasty bargains in the future."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp, I almost passed on this restaurant (mostly because of numerous poor reviews on Yelp.  I'm very happy we decided to eat dinner here and don't know why those poor reviews exist.  The service was truly excellent and the food was certainly very good.  My wife had the open face hot turkey sandwich.  She said it was very good; the gravy was excellent.  I had the liver and onions.  Most places don't offer that, and I love it if done well, so I tried it.  The liver (all 3/4 lb of it) was cooked perfectly - done but not dry. There was a prodigious amount of sauteed onions atop the liver, again cooked perfectly with still some body to them.  The steamed vegetables were done correctly - slightly al dente.  The mashed potatoes were good, as was the mushroom gravy.  The only thing that would have made the liver better was if it were fried in bacon drippings instead of oil.  But, the two full slices of bacon on top were certainly sufficient.  During our two years of travel throughout the United States, we have discovered numerous restaurants that use far too much salt.  It was refreshing to find that I actually had to add just a little bit of salt to my dishes.  In all, this was quite the enjoyable dinner - and the prices are excellent.  Forget about the made-up poor reviews and try this place.  It's worth it.  Don't get me wrong; in Las Vegas, a true foodie city, there is nothing at Palace Station that one would consider a destination restaurant.  But, if you are nearby, or staying there, the Grand Cafe is a worthy spot to eat."}
{"text":"This review is based on the quality of the service rather than the food itself.

To rate the food; I give it a 4/5 for quality and taste given that this place is a cafe in a casino.

To rate the service; I give that a 1/5.

Our server's name was Robert and he was the worst we encountered so far.  He didn't do anything directly negative to us; but the fact that he didn't do anything to help us at all except serve our food.

We sat down and he greeted us with his name with an awkward attitude.  Honestly, we didn't expect a cheerful attitude.  But we did to see a little freshness in his blank expression and tone.

We ordered our food as soon as he came back with our drinks.  A southwest breakfast bowl, angus beef sliders, and a chicken fried steaks with eggs.  Around 15 minutes Robert comes by to tell us that it will just be a few more minutes.  Then another 10 minutes rolls by and our food comes out with the server not saying anything except \"Plate's hot\" and \"Enjoy\".  He did come by and ask how he were; but I won't give him points on that since that's pretty much mandatory for every table.

Nearly 10 minutes into our meal he drops off our check and just leaves not to be seen again.  We didn't know if we were supposed to pay up front or to wait for him so I had to ask the busboy to check where and for a box to wrap up my food.

When we payed up front the nice cashier asked us if we enjoyed our meal and we told her that it was all right but we would like to fill out a comment card.  She attempted to call over her manager but we declined saying that we waited long enough and didn't feel like waiting anymore.

I appreciate the cashiers attempt to rectify the situation; but Robert's attitude towards us has no excuse.

If you're reading this Robert; you deserve the fact that I left you without a tip.

If you're a customer that ends up with Robert, please do what I didn't and tell him or the manager what he did wrong if he doesn't change."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and this place is hit or miss. The first time I came here, I ordered the Crab Benedict. It was actually pretty good, and the service was decent. No problem. My second and third visits, eh, nothing special. Last time I ate at Grand Cafe, was 180 degree difference. The service was super slow, and it took the waiter, (who said it was just his 2nd day), 20 minutes to bring us our drinks. I order a regular eggs benedict, but when the waiter brings it out, it's missing the hollandaise sauce, WTF?? So, he goes back to the kitchen and brings me some [cold] hollandaise sauce in a small bowl. Silverware was dirty too - I had to ask him twice to bring me a new set. I hate to criticize people, but this guys mind was like a blackboard that kept getting erased - as soon as he walked away from the table, he would completely forget what we requested. Now I'm finished with my meal and ask for some water. Guess what - he forgot again. After 10 minutes, I end up asking another waitress to tell the guy to bring me my water. It wasn't even that busy which made it more annoying. I'll go back again, but if that same waiter serves us, I'm walking out."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Ordered the teriyaki chicken dish.  The vegetables were undercooked and it was rather tasteless."}
{"text":"1 star for poor service.  I've never dined here.

After dinner at T-Bones we stopped by Grand Cafe to buy some bakery items.  Unfortunately, the gal behind the counter couldn't find her a$$ with both hands so we (and another couple) walked out without buying anything.  We'll stop by Freed's tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and this time the food wasn't satisfying. I tried their T-bone steak and ask for it to be medium. It turned out to be too dry and over done. To top it off the steak was cold. Compared to the last time, I ordered the chicken and waffle which was to die for. I was a little disappointed this time."}
{"text":"The food here is not good. It's not even that cheap for a local hotel's coffee shop..(I call hotel cafes coffee shops hehe) I think I've tried 1 item from every section of their menu and everything is just average to below .. The service is not good here either. What is kind of good is their complimentary hot bread haha and the restaurant itself is pretty~!!! 

Hot tip: make sure to check in and use the BOGO entrée deal or sign up for a player's card and they frequently send mailer coupons you can use here."}
{"text":"Red Rock Casino is a very nice place with various fine dining options.  However, this place was just okay.  

We came in from a long, hot day of golf and wanted something simple, yet decent.  After a 5 minute wait to get drinks, we finally were given our liquids and ordered. My wife ordered a Turkey Club, which was not bad, according to her, though somewhat salty.  A friend ordered a prime rib that he just devoured and I ordered fish tacos.  

So I get my three fish tacos and they are okay, but they are about the size of a deck of cards.  Very small.  With no sides that come with it.  Quite disappointing and certainly not worth the money.

Service was slow, though Deborah was very personable and friendly.

Time to try something else when in this casino next time."}
{"text":"Decent food typical diner type. Good place to eat on the cheap. Open faced Turkey sandwich was delicious! Tip make sure you sign up for the players card, you get credit for food purchases too, and the last page of the menu has super cheap card member special like a Cheeseburger, fries and soda for $5.99"}
{"text":"Had an excellent late dinner at the Grand Cafe.  Recommended by our server Mo, I ordered the crab omelette.  If was absolutely incredibly delicious!  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Our waiter Mo provided the best service during our entire stay in Las Vegas.  Thank You!"}
{"text":"Was not too impressed with the food. Spaghetti was soggy and T-bone steak was burnt. Potato was hard. The waiter did not  smile at all. He was slow in bringing a refill on the drinks. Then I had my daughter with me to he places a hot plate in front her and tells her it's hot!! Well duh!!! The girls gonna touch it."}
{"text":"Huge T-Bone Steak for $9.99. Its was pretty good. I tried my daughters pancakes and eggs and pretty damn good too. Been here 3 times around 10am and there was no line. All I have to say is Great service and food."}

{"text":"It's not in the Anthem section of Henderson, it's in the Green Valley Ranch Hotel & Casino, which is in... Green Valley Ranch.

I'll keep it brief:  I get coupons for this place, so j keep coming here, even though each & every time, the food has been mediocre.  More times than not, the service was also poor.

It's a shame, because Green Valley Ranch Resort is otherwise awesome!    The cafes at sister properties such as Sunset Station & Fiesta Station are always much better, so I don't know what's going on here, but I need to just throw away the coupons for the GVR Grand Cafe instead of feeling obligated to use them.

Got an omelette & hash browns tonight.  I'm not uppity when it comes to food, but I didn't eat the hash browns because they are very stale."}
{"text":"This is terrible service. Ordered a cheeseburger well done ; told him to burn it. He came back & just threw it on table & was gone in a flash. Never asked if was cooked right; never asked if wanted anything with it; never asked if was ok. I had to flag him down to complain . Told manager & she could care less; never offered to compensate me or anything. Ended up having just a beer & no food. Will never come back."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Red Rock or have the players card, and... it's past midnight. You can take advantage of the small menu but very cheap in cost. The burger was actually very decent and tasty. Have a beer and a burger at midnight, probably not the healthiest choice but it is Vegas."}
{"text":"Food menu!  Some food good some just okay!  Price normal to high!"}
{"text":"Santiago  the server assistant was a very nice and professional man. He made my family experience and the grand cafe very delightful. He is the definition of great customer service"}
{"text":"I eat here alot b/c I play at GVR almost every day. The food and the service is not as bad as people would make it out to be.  Not everything on the menu is great but some things are pretty good.  Personally I like their quesadilla, nachos, salmon eggs benedict and their chicken tenders. My boyfriend and I are friendly with most of the waiters and the service honestly isnt that bad. I am never disturbed when I leave there. Its very convenient and if you play alot, you can get the meal comp'd most of the time; which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Ugh. Don't ever let me pass by a large counter of desserts. 

They had a variety of sweets and pastries on display so we decided to take some home. We got a cheesecake pecan bar and a oreo bar ($2.95) and a 7layer bar ($1.95). The cheesecake pecan bar would have been the best one as the crust was good, the bar was sweet, salty and creamy but it must have been older than the other bars as there was a slight taste of the refrigerator on it. Oreo bar was more like a brownie like cake and cream cheese with some oreo on top, not very heavy on the oreo taste. 7layer was pretty good. 

They were cheap and decent for a late night munchie snack, but nothing I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Dear Debra the morning hostess, 

As I walk up to half empty restaurant, I do not expect to be asked to wait to be seated. The reason subsequently provided was what promoted this note. \"My waiters are too busy\", delivered with implication that customers just overwhelmed this poor establishment. 

You may find most people highly understanding and adaptable, if only you try to appear to be helpful. Apologies if you were simply having a rough morning. Happens to everyone. 

Two stars for decent food."}
{"text":"Cabo's was closed for the night and this was the only place open. We had to wait 25 minutes before we got seated at the table but only because there was a big party ahead of us. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular so I wasn't disappointed by anything. The food is average, the service is average, the prices are cheap, and you do get what you pay for. Got the Cocktail Shrimp appetizer and the Turkey Club Sandwich off the menu, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Okay let me tell you. This place has horrible service. They sit you down then they ignore you. Then Someone finally comes and talks to you and they take your drink order and tell you they are not your waitress so you have to wait longer to actually place a meal order. I came here a second time because it's in the hotel and I was desperate. Last night the same thing happened and while my table \"stuck it out\" another group left very angry for the same treatment and as they were leaving the manager made a nasty comment loud enough for me to hear it 10 feet away like a 2 year old but not loud enough for the guest to hear.... 
   This place had maybe 10 tables of groups of 2-4 people and they had at least 3 waitresses and nobody was getting helped. I looked around and noticed all of the people looking around confused as I was wondering what the problem was.
   This place is so bad I'm writing my first negative review after being on yelp for months. Do yourself a favor if you are staying at the red rock and eat somewhere else that kills the beef while you wait for faster service. I'm giving it one star because yelp won't let me give zero stars.
    All kidding aside, tonight even if I'm hungry for a late night snak, I'm getting dressed and driving around in search of a coffie shop or fast food.Even if I have to drive to the strip which is a distance away, I'm sure to get my food quicker."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 1, I really do.

If not for the $5.99 steak and eggs that were cooked properly, it would have been a 1.

Came to Red Rock for the Ladies all you can drink and to catch a late movie.  We were hungry afterwards and it just happened to be midnight so we naturally sidled up to Grand Cafe for some steak and eggers and stacks o' pancakes.

Medium rare steak and over easy eggs for me.  2 stacks of pancakes for my wife and her sister.  Medium steak and scrambled for my buddy.  2 cups of coffee.  Water all around.  We all had a good time eating, this was our second dinner after Boiling Crab.  Asked for the check around 1255.  Had our table cleared off around 0100 am.  0105 still no sigh of the check.  I overhear our server(at the POS station right next to my chair) muttering about how she can't find our check.  10 minutes later she tells us she can't find our check, and asks if we paid already.  I stupidly said no.  She continues half \"looking\" and half fulfilling drink orders and serving them and taking food orders.  Seriously?  Please find my f*cking check.  Every time I look at her, she's either telling the guy who cleared our table that she can't find our bill, or she's muttering to herself that she can't find it.  I don't understand why this is so mind-boggling.  You can do either of two things at this point.  You could A) ask us what we got or B) Check the tape, because someones always watching in the casino.  If you truly lost it, would it hurt to generate another one, if you know the first won't ever be accidentally paid?  Are you afraid of making too much money?  You're not going to get screwed out of something, but you will get screwed out of your tip if you dick around.  We get up from the table and go to the cashier where the man she answers to, coincidentally, the man who happened to clear our table and ask how everything was, was standing.  She hands him our check.  Like, what kind of abracadabra BS is that?  It just magically appeared in her hand and she gives it to him.  It sucks that she's apologetic and says thanks for being patient. Except I'm not patient.  We ask if we can pay out.  Mr. Man says, \"It'll just be a second I (in italics) JUST got this\".  \"We're just saying, we've been asking for the check for 30 minutes now.\"  His response?  The exact same thing he said earlier.  \"Blah blah, I JUST got this.\"  Don't be a dick, dick.  You know how long we've been waiting to pay.  You're the dude that cleared our table.  And it doesn't hurt to say sorry, it also doesn't pay to be a jerk to your customers.  And it's not like this place is wall to wall patrons.  It's after midnight and it's maybe a quarter to a third full.  So to our server, sorry you got stiffed on the tip, but you can blame that dude you handed our bill too.  I hate to do that.  I know that people rely on their tips, but it's not against the law to not tip, and for me, tips are based not only on service, but also on grace, attitude and the humility to accept when you've screwed something up.  

I hate that my steak was good, and the pancakes were delicious, and the coffee was strong hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times.  I will only go here for breakfast as my lunch and dinner experiences are not worth my time or money.  The staff has been unfriendly, unresponsive, and the food has been served both cold and entirely wrong orders brought to my table.  If this happened once, or even twice, I would think it was a one-off situation.  But by the time the third and fourth visits resulted in the same lack of service and poor food, I will no longer eat here.  I can't say EVERY server/busser/manager is bad, but when it's more than 50%, it's not worth my time.  I wrote a letter which went unanswered.  I wrote again -- same thing.  Then I received an eMail asking out my \"experience with the Grand Café.\"  I told them about my experiences and the person who wrote me asked for a copy of my letters so she could respond properly.  Guess what?  No response...again.  So I write again and told them this is exactly why I wouldn't go there again.  No one cared and low and behold, a FORM LETTER thanking me for my information, apologizing for my experience, and inviting me back.  Definitely a form letter as it didn't respond to any of my points and in fact addressed nothing.  Sorry Stations Casinos, but as for the Grand Café, it is NOT Grand."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Horrible service!

Manager, Donovan

When we arrived there were about 3 parties in line. The hostess came over and asked us how many in our party. She didn't mention it would be a 40 minute wait. When  I asked how much longer they said another 10 minutes, they were busy with a party. 

I asked what could be done for the inconvenience of an hour wait at a coffee shop that has never before had a wait and she got her manager. Donovan was less than helpful and didn't even apologize for the wait. Basically he said too bad. 

We sat unacknowledged at the table for 8 minutes before we were offered a beverage. The quality of the food has severely declined since our last visit. The sandwich was dry. The bread was hard and the french fries inedible. When the waitress eventually returned to ask how the food was, I told her \"not as good as past visits\" she said \"I know. I guess it's because we are busy\". So she knew the food was bad and still served it!

Prices are high. 11.00 for a sandwich, 3.00 for a soda. Not worth it!

In customer service myself for over 20 years I found this unacceptable. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. They were obviously not equipped to handle a lunchtime rush."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful. This morning we sat outside on the patio great weather, great decor and food was fast! they use fresh quality ingredients, my friends and I were very pleased. 

Only bad thing was a long wait in line, maybe because it was a Sunday and long wait for the server to give us the bill and she never came back to pick it up and charge the credit card! 20 mins passed we decided to get up and go to the cashier and pay upfront. And while we waited in line to pay it seemed that the server was in an argument with another employee using really bad language! I'm not sure what happened but it wasn't very unprofessional.

Other than that! Food is tasty c:"}
{"text":"Went here a few times for breakfast and lunch while staying at the Red Rock Resort.  I did not have a bad meal.  The food was delicious.  Buttermilk pancakes were tasty and very satisfying.  The scrambled eggs are so fluffy - I don't know what they did to them to make them so good.  The turkey on sourdough sandwich was yummy.  The turkey was that good, fresh cut of turkey.  I really enjoyed eating here.  It was very affordable, especially for a restaurant in a casino.  The service is a little slow, but if you are not in a rush, it's not an issue.  I would definitely recommend eating here if you are looking for a good, casual place to eat."}
{"text":"I brought my Mom out for a late Mother's Day dinner and I was not content. 

I love the Red Rock Casino. When I drive in from California and don't stay at my moms, I typically stay at the Red Rock. Out of all of the times I've stayed, we've always gone elsewhere to eat for whatever reason. 

Don't get me wrong....the food is standard/average. It's not outstanding and delicious like I thought it would be. It's just ok. I wouldn't crave it later or down the road. I probably would've enjoyed in n out way better. I didn't bother yelping it before we were seated. Big mistake! 

I also ordered a Cadillac margarita.  Worst cadi I've ever had. No joke! It tasted like a margarita mix on the rocks. 

The 2 I'm rating GC is more towards the waiters and hostess and the food wasn't gross. They are very unfriendly.  Our waitress looked as if she just hopped out of bed. The hostess asked me how many? When I responded, she took off. Was I supposed to go with her? Apparently so! I thought people usually communicate with you to guide you. 
She came back laughing saying she was waiting.  I was really bothered and told her that as far as I knew the righteous and courteous  thing to say was \"right this way\" or \"sure, follow me\".  When I brought it up to her attention she wanted to laugh. How unprofessional and senseless of the casino to have a restaurant like this inside their premises and staff on top of it representing their hotel.

Just saying...."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service!  I really like the actual hotel and the pool.  However, this place is very unclean, dirty dishes, nasty floors and horrible management.  I was there the other night and my toddler's shoes came off while sitting at booth waiting for our dinner to arrive.  Next thing you know she lifts up her foot and she has blood running down everywhere so I panic.  The entire security staff comes over takes pictures have me fill out  a form all  while I'm trying to keep my crying toddler calm.  I mean, really?  

To make a long story short, I observed as they were taking pictures that the booth was full of glass and other nasty items that should have been cleaned prior to sitting us there.  So we ended up moving to another table, the whole incident was a huge inconvenience and you'd think that management would have done something to make up for the horrible experience that we encountered during our first visit to their restaurant.

I honestly never complain unless it's warranted, but this was flat out piss poor customer service.  When something goes wrong with your customer especially something like this, you make it right.  Comp the meal, offer free meal tickets so that your customers don 't want walk away unhappy.  Make it right!!! especially when you know you're in the wrong.  Your customers first impression can be a lasting impression.  If you have an opportunity to make it right, do so and then all is well.  

Again, it was my first  time visiting the resort and I actually liked the hotel, but this restaurant was horrible and management clearly doesn't know anything about customer service. The best part about the experience was the server, she was very accommodating and I tipped her accordingly.    Do yourself and favor and don't waste your money here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited to be seated a long time considering 25% of the restaurant had dirty tables that could have been cleaned.  Appeared they were significantly understaffed.  Should have left at this point, but we didn't.  Once seated, realized the menu is too long (think uninteresting overpriced Cheesecake Factory, unless you get the specials.)  The service here is terribly slow, and our server had a lot of attitude.  After waiting over an hour, our food finally arrived lukewarm/cold, it appeared the server forgot our food in the back, but she denied the claim.  Then she told my parents off about us complaining to her about the food being cold.  At the end of the meal, the manager at the payment desk discounted one entree off the meal, but I do not feel that was adequate for the lack of quality and service.  Do not eat here!  The Suncoast and Rampart have better restaurants."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once.  
I won't eat here again unless I have no other options.

The food was mediocre, at best.

The SERVICE however, was non existent. 

Our server took forever to come and take our order, gave us attitude when we asked about using our \"free beer or well drink\" coupons at their bar (the coupon says \"any casino bar\" so we figured the cafe counted.  apparently not.), and spent more time oogling over his coworker's loud screaming child at the table next to us than finding out if we need anything.  

If I want crappy service, I'll go to the foodcourt, not the cafe."}
{"text":"First time here at the grand cafe. The service was great although the full order was wrong ! But we were catching a movie so here is what we picked. The place is very clean but i left disappointed.  Please word of advise have them read back the order before its placed."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful day so we decided to eat at their outside patio area. Beautiful waterfall and greenery. We were enjoying the atmosphere when we finally decided we better go in and get a waitress as no one was servicing the tables. After three requests, a waitress showed up to take our order. After an hour of placing our order we were all but forgotten again. After going in and asking for our order three times we finally got our order. Every dish was dried up, and fresh tomatoes wilted from sitting under a heat lamp. The surface of the food was warm. Beyond that it was cold. 

It's absolutely incredible how poorly this segment of Red Rock Hotel is supervised.

If you want to just sit there with no service of any kind, go there....  Bring your food and a beverage with you, and you would be just fine."}

{"text":"Duplicate Review until Yelp Consolidates the two:
Sticky Bun
Apple Fritter
Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Pancakes
Tableside Flambee Bananas Foster French Toast
Kitchen Sink Cookie
Oatmeal Raisin Cookie
Carrot Cake Bar

Located within walking distance of my door, and visited frequently for movies as well as meals at Hearthstone, I'd admittedly not given much thought to Red Rocks Resort and Casino's other dining options until I found out an old colleague was in town for a Bariatric Surgery conference and with her packed lecture schedule largely precluding lunch or dinner the decision was made to meet up at Grand Café for breakfast, the resulting meal anything but 'physician approved' but surprisingly delicious with service that outperformed nearly any of Las Vegas Boulevard's 24/7 dining options by a country mile.

Arriving just after 7:00am, but requiring a reprint of my Boarding Pass in order to collect on a $15 coupon, it was a few minutes later than anticipated that the two of us sat down in the large dining area overlooking an expectedly empty pool and deferring the order to me with the stipulation that we must try the pancakes a three-course meal was requested, a smiling Hispanic waitress effortlessly managing a half-dozen tables while keeping water brimming and the silver coffee pot of surprisingly balanced brew filled throughout the hour long stay.

Starting off with two pastries, the chopped pecan topped sticky bun and house-made apple fritter both rewarmed at our request, it was much to my astonishment that Red Rocks' in-house pastry team makes items throughout the day in order to replenish supplies and although the fritter was a touch too oily despite being jammed-packed with apples the nicely laminated bun unraveled as a textbook spiral, the exterior golden and crunchy while the interior featured a springy yeasted stretch packed with butter and cinnamon notes.

Moving onward to entrees, the four-stack of chocolate chip studded buttermilk flapjacks taking no shortcuts and fluffy as can be despite the bargain basement price of $8.78, there was no way I was passing of the \"house specialty\" Bananas Foster French Toast and with an unexpected tableside show of liquor-laced caramel being lit ablaze as it was poured over thick egg-bread with whipped cream added afterward every single bite of the dish was well worth not only the $8.95 tab, but also the signature status - easily one of the best off-Strip French Toasts in town and the only one I know of that is delivered with such flair.

Sitting, chatting, and sipping at third pot of coffee with my friend stating she couldn't possibly eat another bite it was only here that I realized I'd not yet spent the requisite $30 to qualify for use of the coupon and leaving aside just how much of a bargain that indicates for the rest of what we ordered it also justified the purchase of a trio of desserts, the elegant carrot cake beneath crispy praline bark proving quite moist even before considering the rich cream cheese frosting while both of the cookies were admittedly quite sweet, though soft centered with a crispy rim that held up nicely for an afternoon snack later that day.

Using the coupon with a total bill after tax and tip ringing in at a mere $26 one would be hard pressed to name a better bargain for such a large amount of surprisingly well made food in any Southern Nevada casino and with service proving better than several places charging more than twice the price for food no better I've little doubt I'll revisit Grand Café sooner rather than later, at the very least to sample some more of the extensive pastry case...though I can't rule out another order of fiery French Toast, as well."}

Chosen for lunch when I delivered a colleague visiting for a conference back to the hotel, a visit to Grand Café at Palace Station served as my second experience at one of Station Casino's 24-hour eateries, and although the pasty case was not quite as well apportioned as that at Red Rock, it was to the same menu of diner eats and American classics that we were treated, the service a bit less attentive than at the Summerlin iteration but the cuisine no less competent or well priced.

Located just inside the Self-Park garage, mere steps away from the gaming floor outside, Grand Café at Palace Station features a rounded central bar set on both sides by tiered dining and opting to be sat opposite several large parties our arrival was greeted with menus and water, the humorous 'My Generation\" placemats cleared from tables as a sizable selection of pastries and entrees were made.

Largely self-selected, my dining partner already sated from a lunch at the conference from which she came, it was with a shared cinnamon roll and banana nut muffin - both rewarmed and piping hot to touch - that the dining began and while the tightly wound roll lightly topped with icing was as good as the sticky bun from previous experience the muffin was unfortunately marred by what can only be assumed as artificial banana extract, the flavor too sweet and far underspiced despite a crumb that was quite moist.

Moving next to 'entrees,' the Log Cabin eschewed for pure maple syrup that has become a staple of my weekend laptop bag, a four-stack of pancakes punctuated with fresh blueberries proved every bit as good as the chocolate chip version enjoyed at Red Rock and again challenging DuPar's for best the best Buttermilk batter in the valley a similar tangy topnote imbued both members of a duo of biscuits, the fluffy rounds just-short of golden but otherwise excellent beneath a topcoat of butter and honey served alongside a selection of jams.

At this point quite full, but still with ten bucks to spend on the hotel's $30 voucher, it was with three cookies and an abysmally dry cupcake that the meal would end, and although the cutesy \"Black and White\" was far less interesting than it would have been had the kitchen actually used cocoa or lemon instead of just sugary vanilla, both the chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies were homey and classic, the lightly crisp rim and soft center dense with flavor yet relatively low in sweetness, the results far better than one would expect from a simple café in a smoky off-strip Casino...or even one along Las Vegas Boulevard charging a dollar or two more.

Generally disinterested in the soups, sandwiches, salads, or entrees offered at places of this ilk, Grand Café once again proves to a good spot for a cheap breakfast for locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Located inside the Red Rock Resort and Casino, Grand Café is your typical run-of-the-mill 24-hour diner with a menu that has something for everyone.  It was about 10:00 in the morning when we dined here... there was no wait, so we were seated promptly. And that was the only thing that was ever prompt. The rest of the dining experience was... fair but slow as molasses. Our server was polite, very chatty, but everything just took so long. From the taking the order of the drinks to receiving the drinks, to the food order to getting the food - everything took seemingly FOREVER.

The food itself was fine.  We ordered a Denver omelet, kid's pancakes and bacon, and a BLTA w/ fries.  The BLT came with generous amounts of bacon and the fries were good and crispy. The breakfast entrees were pretty basic and standard. 

In short - meals were fine but don't come here if you're in any kind of a hurry!"}
{"text":"For a 24 hour cafe, this is great and always wonderful, friendly service! The fish and chips are delicious! Check my picture of them!  Be sure and try a Danish with an espresso as well!"}
{"text":"Big portions .Great customer service . Pleasant pricing ... Jennifer was great .. nice ambiance"}
{"text":"I was insanely hungry for French toast the other day and decided \"why not\" with Grand Cafe. My sister and I were seated immediately at a comfortable half-booth table normally for four guests. Our waitress was nice, but as soon as two other regulars (or hotel guests?) arrived, most of her attention went to them. Shortly after ordering, our beverages arrived. I had ordered coffee, but the waitress served it to my little sister. Not a big deal, but spillage occurred, since the cup was full to the brim. The food took longer to arrive than I would have liked. When it did arrive, I was surprised by the amount of chocolate chip adorned my sister's pancakes. It looked great, but she ended up smearing most of it to the edge of her plate. My French toast was very good, but nothing special.

A second visit a few weeks after the above experience was improved. The Belgian waffle I ordered was cooked to perfection, but my sister's chocolate ship pancakes were flat. Literally. I'd imagine that the leavening was a bit off in that batch. The coffee was also very good during this visit."}
{"text":"While at our stay in palace station, we decided to try the cheap eatery after midnight. We ordered the all-nighter skillet (2) and 1/4 classes  cheeseburger with fries (4) for 8.

- Slow service. barely anyone was there and it took about 25min to cook a over-easy eggs and 1/4 burger patty. haha
-Salty! fries so salty i was getting HTN.  
- Skillet itself so oily. I swear it was almost a mirror now so greasy.
- crispy hash browns. yum!
- Not many drunks. :)
- I don't think I come here for anything else. Only their all nighter deals 12am-6am
- Must have boarding pass."}
{"text":"Nice rooms, great restaurants and bars. However the casino has low ceilings, so the smoke was overwhelming."}
{"text":"Will never come back to this establishment ever again. They reduced the portion sizes. Up the prices and the good quality did not improve at all. I suggest to avoid it. They are doing terrible job of keeping their customers happy.
Very disappointed because I liked coming here before. For God sake they are charging 3$ for a fountain drink."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful cafe.  Such undependable food.  Such long wait times.

We decided weeks ago not to dine at the Cafe except for breakfast (their a.m. special is really good except toast comes unbuttered now), but my partner was salivating over his last big burger there with cheese dripping over the sides & on a Brioche bun.  Whoops!  Not so any longer.  This $5.99 special is now a thin patty with no drippy cheese & shredded lettuce smothering it, but does sit atop that Brioche bun.  I ordered the fish & chips special & was shocked to find 2 thin pieces of over-breaded fish & decided Gorton's fish sticks were way better.  No kidding, I could not taste the fish buried therein & the accompanying fries were limpy & not hot.

The Grand Cafe recently changed their menu & we were disappointed to find these items no longer included:   fish tacos, kale salad (wonderful & full of the best veggies), & the Teriyaki Bowl.  They did have a very good Asian chicken salad but now it has all cabbage instead of any lettuce (duh).

Why does a huge operation such as this continue to be low-grade?  Red Rock is a fine casino that normally caters well to its patrons.  And how can the main chef at the buffet be so adept & pay attention to our needs, when the powers-that-be in the Grand Cafe keep missing the mark?"}
{"text":"A pretty darn decent place for a casino cafe!  Good service and halfway decent food.  The only complaint I can think of is that it was REALLY hot in there.  We asked if there was a problem with the AC and didn't really get an answer but it was stifling."}
{"text":"This place is a wanna be GRANDE LUX cafe. Don't let the name fool you! Food quality sucks. The only thing that is semi good is the shrimp cocktail ( which is 3.99 at Santa fe station and $10.00 at the Red Rock location). I have tried this place twice. And both times I felt like I wasted time and calories coming to this stupid place. If you're staying at Red Rock and you want a place to eat don't come to this joint. Instead, check out Yardhouse,  the mexican restaurant, the food court, buffet or march your happy ass across the street to BJs."}
{"text":"A part of me cringed when a friend suggested the Grand Cafe as a dinner option. It is not so much the food that induces this reaction, but more about the memories it brings back. I spent a few years working at GVR and drifted between many of the food outlets. By far, the cafe was the toughest to handle. Let's just say the movie \"Waiting\" felt like our lives. Minus the unhygienic shenanigans. 

Now that I am on the other side, I can definitely appreciate it a little more. The service was pleasant and prompt. My friend and I had ordered the prime rib dinner. I got mine with a baked potato and he got his with mashed. We were both pleased with our meals. It was not out of this world, but it was good. It is the same prime rib that is served at the buffet. If you want to stuff yourself then it would be best to go next door.

The remodel does bring a more sophisticated atmosphere to the coffee shop. The layout is still the same as the old one, but updated with nicer furniture and fixtures.I would dine here again if I was in the GVR."}
{"text":"This place seems to serve buffet leftovers with a restaurant price. I had meatloaf which actually was frozen and then fried on a pan. It should be called dry beef patty burned on both sides. Veggies from cans that came with it were a bad joke at best. Kids spaghetti and meatball (there's only one ball) was decent the ball being watery.

With 7-8 employees and no customers overall experience was OK but not worth money or time. You're better off with the buffet. Or actual restaurants nearby the casino. Do Denny's or IHOP if you want better but not buffet or restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in for the breakfast it was about 2 o'clock in the morning, the place was relatively empty not a lot of tables and not a lot of people we had to waited to be seated and it took a good 10 minutes before they came and took our order and the place was pretty much empty.   I ordered the bacon & eggs, eggs over easy, toast, biscuits and gravy it was good.  One thing, you would think a short order cook could fry an over easy eggs without breaking it.  Not here!   Both eggs were broken, they looked like a train wreck .  I asked for two new ones and they to looked like a wreck, just eat the messed up eggs.  Stay away from the graveyard shift, stick with the day crew."}
{"text":"When a restaurant that serves breakfast tries to make excuses for watered-down coffee, that is not a restaurant you want to go to. If you do not drink coffee for breakfast, that may be OK with you. The coffee served looked as light as tea and tasted like water. It took us five minutes just to flag someone down to let them know about it. The excuse that we got was that the machine makes the coffee and decides on its concentration??? A smaller coffee carafe was brought to us and it was a little more decent yet still watered down. The waiter actually said that we should order espressos which would cost a little more but would be better coffee. We ended up going to Starbucks after for real coffee.
The food is OK. I had the red rock spa breakfast platter which came with egg whites scrambled, apple sausage, and wheat toast. What was extremely disappointing was that I also ordered a fruit platter. I was not aware that a fruit salad tossed in a very small bowl that is easily at least one day old is considered a fruit platter. What is worse, it cost $10 and was likely only worth three dollars.
This is not a restaurant I would recommend for breakfast to anyone as it just wasn't very good in terms of the competition out there for breakfast and the service was average to less than average. The restaurant looks nice, but the actual substance of it is poor. This is not a restaurant that I plan on returning to."}
{"text":"Ok food but poor service, reminds me of a dennys but inside the casino, the reason for the one star was our waitress placed our order brought the food and never came back to check on us, however she checked on multiple other customers more than once, we felt maybe she thought we wouldn't tip so f us. It was my birthday i finished all the orange juice i was drinking and really needed a water. Waited like 15 min and even put the empty glass by the side of the table no acknowledging of us. My girl got up went to the cashier to ask for a water for me, to top it off they didnt even put ice, just lukewarm tap water. We tipped everywhere in vegas at least $5 except here. When we went to pay. The server was all over the cashier thinking we were gonna skip out on the bill or something me and my girl thought it was rude. We will never stop by grand cafe again due to the bad!!! Service."}
{"text":"Close to home. Excellent prices and the service has always been good.  Great place for a steak and baked potato.  $9.95
It's really nice to sit on the patio for breakfast."}
{"text":"Grand Cafe is a great place especially after late night bowling! 

We had a big party of 10 & they were so accommodating. We had a great server named Pennie! She was amazing & great to our table. We were celebrating a birthday and she even told our celebrant a birthday.

I ordered the four cheese quesadilla and thought I would get one big quesadilla, but they came out mini sized quesadillas! They were perfect bite size with salsa, sour cream & guacamole on the side. 

Great place to eat for 24/7 dining!"}
{"text":"This was yummy. We got the Bananas Foster French Toast (signature dish there), eggs, and sausage and bacon...VERY yummy. I did taste some grill cleaner a bit, but the food was so good I ignored it and just skipped half of my scrambled eggs. Rosie was very cool as our server and the Hispanic gentlemen who brought us our drinks was very cool too. Overall, great food, atmosphere, and experience. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We stayed at Palace Station which made a 24 hr place convenient, however both times I was disappointed. First I had the 'veggie omelette' which was subpar, way too much onion which also tasted like they were a week old. Plus lacked any cheese at all to call an omelette, my English muffin was SOAKED in oil, it was like a wet sponge when squeezed slightly, but they corrected and gave me new to add butter as I pleased (thumbs up to the waitress!) . The second time I had the 'All American French Toast' with three eggs, I've never in my life had over easy eggs that the whites were still raw. The French toast was ok, my boyfriend had 'Huevos Rancheros' which were nothing near authentic to anything we've ever had in New Mexico, Arizona or Colorado.  It had fried corn tortillas with hardly any beans, some sliced black olives which is in no way a authentic Mexican additive, the only dish so far worth having is the \"lighter fair\"- value breakfast. Not hard to mess up simple eggs, toast, and hash browns. But then again I could be wrong."}
{"text":"There's a coupon on Yelp!  :) so that's good.  It's like a diner, they have a bar, they've got like 2 tv's.  Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  You're not going to plan a trip to go out of your way to eat there, but if you're in the Casino it ain't bad. Nice people here struck up conversations with a couple of people at the bar while waiting on my food.  Guy next to me swears by the Crab Omelet, said next time I come in there I have to order that b/c it's really really good. I got eggs, hasbrowns and sausage can't really mess that up and you can't really make it eggceptional either [egg joke I know sorry]. With coffee think my bill was over $12, now considering the buffet is like under $10 and less than $20 for brunch [with a mimosa] on Sunday probably should consider that."}
{"text":"There a few good things about this cafe - there's hardly ever a line after midnight.  Service is always fast and efficient. And, of course, the breakfast specials that starts at midnight is one of the reasons why I like coming here for a very early morning breakfast. 

During my last visit here, I ordered the chicken fried steak. No, no, no... it was sooo chewy. I took a bite and had such a hard time chewing it. I spit it out and I should have said something to the waitress but I didn't want to fuss over a meal that was only $4.99. I did eat the scrambled eggs and hash browns which were good.

I think the next time I come here for breakfast, I will just stick with the pancakes or waffles."}
{"text":"We had a locals coupon so decided to go here especially to sit outside near the pool. But there was no service outside so we were stuck indoors. We both got specials which were reasonably priced. Service was good, apparently better than others on recent visits. My trout was delicious. The veggies would have been good but they were drenched in butter. The salad was fresh and a generous portion. Hubby's steak was okay. His mashed potatoes were too good; I wanted to eat them. It is much prettier than Santa Fe's Grand Cafe. Good value for a local casino and nice change of pace from the buffet. However, we probably won't go back without the coupon."}
{"text":"After the Red Rock Bowling UYE, I was invited to have a late night bite to eat with Roger, Rhia and their family.  It was close to 2 a.m. and you'd think that they would be on the ball, as it wasn't that busy.  It took a while to seat us, which was alright, because there were 10 in our party.  We sat down and checked out the late night menu.  I just wanted potatoes, that's it! I had a taste for potatoes.  I know, late night starch and carbs.  But, I already have screwed up my diet for the week, so I didn't care.  They had a great late night special. 2 eggs, hash-browns and toast for $1.99.  What a deal!  Anyhow, we ordered drinks and for some reason the kitchen was backed up.  The night manager came to our table to let us know that.  So, the wait was about 1/2 hour.  I didn't mind... I can be a bit of a night owl at times.  But, Roger and Rhia had their kids in tow, so I felt for them.  You could tell that the wait was getting long because Roger passed out.  The food eventually came out and it was good.. about what I could cook at home, but for 2 bucks it couldn't be beat.

2 stars because the waitress was nice and the company was great.  Plus the little jelly jars were awesome."}
{"text":"We were not impressed with our visit to the Grande Cafe. It does look nice, though. I'd hang out here for a basic breakfast with my tablet or newspaper if I were a hotel guest. But the food quality was not that great, and service was lacking. 

I ordered Huevos Rancheros. First of all, it came out looking like a hot, soupy mess suffocated with cheese. I had to send a posse to search for the corn tortillas. They were located at the bottom of the mass, drenched and drowned. No flavor at all. They may well have been made out of construction paper. 

If I hadn't read the menu I wouldn't have known there were refried beans in this dish. I mean, were there any? I don't know. The only distinguishable ingredients were the eggs, bell peppers and cheese. Oh, and some \"salsa.\" 

Now, to be fair, you shouldn't expect excellent Mexican food at a general cafe-style restaurant, but this was beyond bad. 

The waitress pretty much forgot us. Didn't ask if we needed anything. No drink refills, nothing. We had to flag her over a couple of times for minor requests. Just disappointing all the way around."}
{"text":"The pricing here is right, they are open 24 hours and they have a pretty decent menu. But don't come here if you're in any hurry, the service is slow. Depending on the time of day, expect to wait quite a while to be seated. Unless you're eating in the middle of the night - anywhere close to meal time you'll stand in a long line to wait for seating.

They have a great outdoor patio that faces the pool area. It's beautiful! But if you sit out there be willing to wait even longer for a server. We ate there for breakfast this morning. It took an hour to get seated, and then another 15 mins for our server to come over. He was attentive in placing our order and getting drinks, but our food took another half hour to come out. He didn't bring salt or pepper and we had to wait another 5 mins for him to come back and check on us. The food was good, although they put the wrong cheese in my omelette (was supposed to be goat cheese and they put cheddar - WAY different). When our server brought our check he never fame back for it. We waited and waited and finally took our bill inside to pay.

As a side note, they always have 3 daily specials for boarding pass members (Red Rock player's card holders) - one breakfast, one lunch, one dinner. Today's breakfast special was 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, hash-browns and toast for $3.99. Dinner was Salisbury steak and potatoes for $9.99 - not too bad."}
{"text":"I had a $10 off coupon from Station.  The plan was to do the feast buffet for lunch but the line was so ridiculously long on a Tuesday.  LBS didn't accept the coupon so we opted for this.  

My wife got the corn beef hash which came with eggs, hash browns and toast.  Good portion but she's definitely had better.  I got the California benedict for $10 and that was a total joke.  Small plate portion and I guess the chef doesn't know how to poach eggs either.

Looked like all the regulars were getting salads.  Maybe that's what I'll go for next time although I am pretty sure I am not coming back.  I'd do IHOP over this anytime."}
{"text":"Stopped in on at 1am on Wednesday morning 10-28-15 and were seated without much of a wait.  Really like the value of their late night menu. I had the 2 eggs with bacon, hash browns, and toast.  My only gripe was I thought the hash browns were too greasy.  The eggs were a perfect over easy and the bacon was tasty.  

The service was attentive and friendly with servers stopping by to top off waters.

Will stop in again when I'm at Red Rock."}
{"text":"Should have read Yelp reviews!! Cold and SLOW! Bad all around. Stay away. Low quality overpriced food. Uncomfortable seats. I can't believe I have to fight for even breakfast this is Vegas and that place is not Grand!!!"}
{"text":"Oh dear god. What is wrong with this place?! I have never had such a bad breakfast before. I had \"huevos rancheros\". Obviously whoever runs this place has no idea what this dish is. Came out as three corn tortillas (not fried, just barely warmed and plenty soggy), canned refried beans, over easy eggs, some sort of red and green salsas, chopped tomatoes, olives, and about three handfuls of melted mozzarella cheese covering the entire dish. I ate about one before I just gave up. One big sloppy disgusting mess."}
{"text":"This is not a place I would voluntarily choose to eat. The place is understaffed and employees are undertrained and underwhelmed. We usually order a steak but it's almost always \"Meh\". If you've got to use your comps in a pinch, eat here."}
{"text":"Went to eat here with my parents, husband and children after the line for the buffet was too long.  It was around 6pm and we were sat after about 5 minutes.  It was pretty clear that there were not enough waiters and the bus boys were non existent.  

We waited 15 minutes to order food and then about 10 minutes after that for the apps to come.  The chicken nachos were awesome! And the chicken tenders were great too.  When the food came, we had to ask for the dressing to my salad 4 times before it was brought out and 3 times for 1 refill on our drinks.  We ate our food with the dirty appetizer plates on the table.  

The waiter was so busy that he could hardly check on our table.  He was friendly but clearly his section was too large (both inside and outside).

The price was good and the food was pretty tasty.  Unfortunately the inappropriate staffing choices by management led to poor service."}
{"text":"I was visiting my mom in Vegas for the holidays and Red Rock is her go-to casino.  So we were there gambling and had dinner at the Grand Cafe.  They definitely can be hit or miss on the food and service but this time around everything was great.  

I had the kitchen sink salad (I think that is what its called).  Its with shrimp and hearts of palm.  I always get balsamic vinaigrette with it instead of the dressing listed on the menu.  This is always one of my favorite salads.

Mom had the Philly cheesesteak with fries.  It was huge.  She liked the meat flavor and the grilled peppers and onions.  She took half of it home for another meal.  

Service was consistent. Drink refills were regular.  Overall a good meal."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once before, for breakfast and not quite sure what I had, but it was decent enough not to be memorable, no love or hate.  I do recall a friend of mine having the country fried steak and being a bonified CFS connoisseur, claims it was pretty darn good.  I believe another friend of mine ordered done whip cream with a side of coffee, lol.  Other than that, it's aight.  The rating on Yelp isn't that great and may make diners reluctant to order.  Still, I hope that restaurants take criticism to heart and learn from reviewers.  

It was a pleasant surprise to learn that the patty melt received some good reviews and decided to put it to the test.  Everyone else seemed to get the normal casino dishes, steak, prime rib, etc.  The bad thing was that all the prime ribs that came out were way overcooked.  The good thing is that our server managed to replace them free of charge and done to preference the next go around (medium rare and slightly bloody). 

I know that Station Casino's mail out a monthly discount booklet, one of which included this place for a $10.00 discount.  Unsure of the specifics, but not a bad deal at all.  Unfortunately, we failed to bring it, again and dealt with the damage accordingly.

Otherwise, the place is convenient and quick and nestled into a corner of the Red Rock casino floor, which can be confusing to navigate at times.

The deserts to me are more of a highlight here if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible.  It does not matter whether the restaurant is slow or busy. The food consistently comes out cold. We have tried to give them many chances and it never changes. Today I ordered a pot of their fresh brewed black tea.  The bus boy brings me out a cup of hot water and a tea bag. When I asked if they changed their tea -  he's short with me and tells me that they are out of pots??  The place is almost empty. No apology and just walks away. 

Then the food comes out. Round one.  My sausages are luke warm at best.  I send them back. Round two.  My sausages are RAW. No apology from the waiter. He just looks to make sure I'm not lying. A few minutes later, he comes back,  without a word, grabs the check off the table and brings it back  (He took my meal off but never said a word). 

I've stayed away for a long time ftom here for experiences like this.  I'm not sure I will give them anymore."}
{"text":"The star is for the food itself as it is really good. 

The service on the other hand.. Particularly \"Amber\" tall white blonde girl with a braided pony tail started off as rude. I get that sometimes people have bad days.. but when it comes to work especially when your a waitress that deals with people (on veterans day to especially a veteran).. your attitude was not needed especially the part when you slammed my drink down on the table and spilled it everywhere. All we wanted was some attention on our table because apparently all the other staff was too blind or too inconsiderate to help us.. so yeah.. of course i was persistent on trying to get some service like (ordering more food and getting a refill on my water) waiting on 30+ minutes just for something like that.. maybe being apologetic or even faking that you guys were too busy and that wait times are expected to be 30+ minutes on a refill.. then i can just laugh about it.. instead.. another pissed off customer to the infamous grand cafe.."}
{"text":"Came here late night around 12-1AM with my boyfriend and his brother, and I loved my experience here. Everything was very clean, the food came out perfectly plated, and side note I loved how the glass cups looked! 
Service was fast, kind and they constantly checked up on us. Great late night meal."}
{"text":"Hidden due to construction, look hard to find location. Service could have been better, waitress needs to be more upbeat and cheerful."}
{"text":"We are local, and have eaten at most GVR restaurants, and this was by far the worst.  The server was friendly, thus the only reason I went 2 stars instead of 1.

We were there Sunday morning for breakfast, around 8pm, so well before the busy time.  Seated right away but took at least 15 minutes to get coffee.  I had their signture banana fosters french toast - and honestly I never met a french toast I didn't like, until then.  I love bananas foster also, and while some are better than others, this was just terrible.  No flavor, and not sure what they used to do the flame, and while a nice presentation, it tasted like kerosene in the food.

The people dining next to us ending up leaving, as their food was served not to order, and cold.  When nothing got done, they got fed up and left.  

When we finally left, and were waiting for the extremely slow checkout process, we noticed quite a few bugs in the pastry case. 

Do yourself a favor, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"You would expect a resort of this stature would figure out how to handle a coffee shop. Not a chance. Been here twice in a month. Won't be back. I don't think management cares. They are catering to tourists who will not be coming on a regular basis. They are not really interested in the \"locals\".

Had 2 managers on the floor when we went in. Many empty tables and an over abundance of people working there. However, the service was really lacking. Went for breakfast and were there 10 minutes without anyone even taking our drink orders. Finally a manager came by and asked if we had ordered our coffee. He took our drink orders and disappeared. Then the food server came to take the food order. She disappeared and the manager came back with coffee and water. No coffee cups on the table. It took the manager another 10 minutes to find us coffee cups. 

The food delivery was just as organized. The delivery person brought the wrong food to our table. We explained that we hadn't ordered any of this food. He realized it was supposed to be the next table over. 

When the food arrived it was marginal at best. The hashbrowns were the worst thing ever. I think they went and got them off the buffet and brought them to us. Cold mushy and the flavor was horible. The only time we saw our server again was when she brought the bill. 

Breakfast is one of the easiest meals to cook. Eggs, pancackes bacon and sausage. Not much variation there. Hard to screw up breakfast but these clowns have succeeded. Go elsewhere....Anywhere"}
{"text":"Most bland breakfast burrito ever. Why server Mexican food if you can't make it to spec? 

Salsa - bland
Burrito - bland
Hash browns - bad
Orange juice - good

Service - good.

Please avoid eating Mexican items here, go to some other place."}
{"text":"Slow service and an less then average meal , how can you over cook a hamburger? We waited for water, we waited for drinks, we waited for our order to be taken, we waited for our food to be served and it was disappointing at best, and then we waited for our bill! Oddly enough it was not that busy in the restaurant and that should have been our first clue to run. Stay away from this venue if your staying at or near the Red Rock Casino, there are much better choices on the property and nearby. Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Food is good service is slow and I witnessed the lady wiping off silverware right under a camera at 11:22 am today (12/8) drop a fork on the floor and pick it up and wipe it off and put it back up with the silverware. That doesn't seem like the best restaurant practices. 
also our waiter has been missing in action for about 15 minutes.  Took forever to get our bill."}
{"text":"We had Lorena as our server, and she was very nice and attentive. However, the food was poor. Eggs we slimy and strange, toast not really toasted, hash browns a little burned on the outside.  Like it was all done by someone who didn't know how to cook. Too bad,  of a lot of breakfast choices here. This should be better."}
{"text":"The service from the kitchen might be a bit slow (oddly enough mostly at breakfast when it's emptiest), but the servers are sure friendly. The food is all great. I had a wonderful crab and avocado salad here one day for lunch and the next morning for breakfast a crab avocado omelet. That omelet was stuffed full of fresh crab meat - well worth the price. This is also the only 24 hour food place on the hotel property."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Station Casinos but I love their coffee shops for food. I never go to casino buffets but you will find me here sometimes. I have only been a couple of times but always enjoy my order.

We usually come for breakfast but we were a little hungry after the movie this time so we walked in here after. No line, seated quickly! Thank you!
Our server came over and took our drink order. I was craving some tomato soup and a grilled cheese so that I what I ordered. Hubby chose the turkey special. I thought this was kinda funny seeing how the next day was a Thanksgiving but he did not seem to mind. We waited longer than usual and sure why but our food finally came. 
My grilled cheese was sooooo good! Two different types of cheese and this insanely soft but crunchy in the right places bread. The tomato bisque was creamy and light. I just can't say enough good things about my selection. Hubby was happy too and expressed his approval of the turkey special. 

Our server was a little slow but efficient and very nice. I love that this lil place and the food they serve . It is not all fancy or exotic, it is just tasty!"}
{"text":"Meh...service had no energy..cold fries..stale cookie..it wasnt good"}
{"text":"Hubby and I go here every week for \"date night\" and order the prime rib.  Our favorite server \"Tia\" is absolutely the best!  He memorized our order the first time we met him, now when we go in we make sure we sit in his station AND all we do is sit down.  He knows what we want, he brings it!  If we want any changes we just let him know up front, but we always get the same thing.  Awesome service!  The menu is pretty big and has a really nice variety of items, something for everybody.  The prices are good.  One of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Good quality for the price! A little slow but all in all a solid place to grab breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Our experience at Grand Cafe in Palace Station was okay. First the positives, they have terrific specials including the breakfast one I ordered for $3.99. It included bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. My little one, hubby, and mother in law had sandwiches which were pretty good too. However, while our server was friendly the actual service we received in all areas was not great. There was a looonngg wait even with VIP guests being seated first it was too long for barely anyone there. I asked for coffee,  when beverages were brought over it was forgotten. I asked our server she apologized and said her co-worker didn't feel well and brought it. We wanted to play keno. We had our numbers ready and asked a lady to please have the keno girl come by and she never came. Hopefully this experience was just a one time shortfall, otherwise not worth it!"}
{"text":"It was a fun evening at the Grand Opening of Downtown Summerlin, but every food joint at the place was absolutely packed so we decided to wait it out until the light show was over to grab a bite.  First of all, 2/3 of the permanent restaurants were still not open so choices were limited to begin with.  By the time the show was over, most of the food trucks started to close so we decided to just head over to Red Rock Resort and grab a bite.  We've always wanted to try the café for their daily deals, so that was our objective.

The $9.99 daily special was the bbq tri-tip, so we ordered one of those and the everyday special T-bone steak, also at $9.99.  What we got was ample - meat with mashed potatoes and corn-on-the-cob, and T-bone with baked potato and steamed veggies - for a $10 meal.  The taste was typical diner, sort of reminiscent of highway diners actually.  Meats were not bad, not good, obviously not the best cut but just fine taste-wise.  The sides were better - both potatoes were good, corn was a bit bland, and veggies looked like they came from frozen bags but still as good as any other steamed frozen veggie.  And the bbq sauce was really good.  Altogether not a bad $10 deal.

Our server was really nice, pretty speedy with what we requested but did forget to bring our forks on first request.  Easy to forgive, since he always wore a smile and was always positive.  Probably less then 3-stars for the food, but the service and generally relaxed atmosphere deserves rounding up.  Not sure we'd go back for the food though, or maybe we'll try some non-meat dishes when we're hungry late-night.

Table-for-1 Factor:  As with any casino cafes, if you can't eat alone here you can't eat alone anywhere."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday morning with the family.  Service, especially the person who greeted us at the table and took our drink order was fantastic.  Dude was so happy to see each and every customer it was unreal.  We order a scrambled bowl, pancakes platter and an item off the \"Spa\" menu (more healthy options).  My husband thought the spa meal was great, and the little guy loved the pancakes.  Service was good overall and our meal came surprisingly fast, just in time for a squirming 3 year old. 

I would say, for being off the strip and inside a casino, the prices were a tad high for breakfast.  I would guess they would have specials during the week, but they were no where to be found on Saturday.  I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Coming soon...

April 1
JB Pastrami
Joey Cheeseburger Special
Me Steak and Shrimp special (not on menu)
Buffalo wings appetizer
Slow/inattentive service."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for breakfast and dinner and the food is always very consistent and good.  Nothing seems to blow us away as exceptional, but for good, consistent food when we are not sure what we want to eat, we come to Grand Cafe and it is always good!  I love the Waffle Breakfast Plate as super good, and the dinners are also good.  Good sized portions, we never leave hungry."}
{"text":"This place saves me every Friday night. After a late workout there not much else open at 2am. And for $5.99 the Steak and Eggs is just what the body needs."}
{"text":"Decent food, prices, and service. The prime rib burger was delicious, the fish and chips decent but not an \"oh wow this is delicious\".

Our waitress was so attentive, gracious, and funny she made it a great experience."}
{"text":"Went to eat here for the first time. It has really nice decor and I love the red rock. The service was amazing, we got seated quickly and the server and server assistant were on top of their game. The food was alright, I mean you can't mess up a three egg meal. The hash browns weren't as crispy as I'd expect, but nothing to complain about. I would come eat here again."}
{"text":"We came here during the off-peak hours, so the service was good. The food we ordered was okay; it was just a bit too greasy. I'll probably stop by again to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"We are locals and had family in town last week.  They stayed two nights at Red Rock and I stayed one of those nights with them.  Had a great dinner that evening at the New Mexican restaurant.  The next day, it couldn't have gone more south.  We were seated very quickly which was a plus, but that is where it ends.  Took approximately 10 minutes to even get a hello.  Water took even longer to get.  After placing our order, we received our lunch 40 minutes later.  Saw many employees standing around chatting.  After delivering the meals one of our guests was told they were out of coleslaw so they decided to give her the French Fries instead.  No other options, apparently.  This was noon.  Out of coleslaw so soon?   The person who delivered the meals left the empty soup bowls on the table.  He had a tray.... Why not go back with something on the \"said\" tray.   I placed the soup bowls on the ledge above where we sat and they finally were removed 15 minutes later.  Had to ask for more water as the glasses were empty.   Terrible service, not so great food equals we will never be back."}
{"text":"We came here after some visitors gambled for 10 hours and got some voucher. We were all hungry, and it was the only option and place open at 3a.m. We had an $80 voucher, so we were on a mission to spend it all in one sitting between 3 people. 

Everything we ordered was terrible, except for the shrimp cocktail, and their chili. I wouldn't come here out of choice, but rather as a necessity. There are plenty other options available at Red Rock, if you're lucky enough not be resorting to the one 24-hour establishment on premise during their late hours. Sigh...I wish we had saved that voucher and spent it at the other restaurants which are good. 

GOOD LUCK."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was great. But the one night we were hankering late, they closed to \"clean.\" That was a huge bummer. Besides that minor inconvenience, it is clean and moderately priced to avoid the more expensive places."}
{"text":"Usually love this place but today it wasn't up to par. Sat waiting for food for an hour. Took 15 minutes to get drink order. The place wasn't even busy. The food came on hot a plate but the food itself was lukewarm at best. The lettuce on my sandwich had wilted. The chicken on the pesto pasta was dry and the sauce had solidified. The ranch dressing was watery which turned me off completely. The manager was nice and tried to make it right but after waiting for an hour we didn't have time for the cafe to remake our food. I hope that this place gets it together because some items on the menu are amazing. But between the bad service and the disappointing food experience I think I'll stay away for the time being.

The check came and the managers solution was to give us $6.00 off our check even though every meal in our party was awful. It was as though the meals were under the heat lamp for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Not sure how I want to write this review. The food wasn't good or special enough to bring us back on its own.  

Our service was good but not great enough to overcome the mediocre food. 

I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger and it was almost flavorless. Pretty sure they are using hamburger with little to no fat as that is where a lot of a burgers flavor comes from. I don't know what was going on with my pickles but they had a weird flavor that didn't blend well with the rest of the burger.

My GF enjoyed her French Dip but thought it was a rather small serving size.

Best part of the meal was the complimentary bread and the French Fries. 

After we had ordered a table next to ours was sat and told about the Daily Specials/or their secret menu.  If you don't see something you like you may want to ask about the Specials as that would have prevented us from ordering the food we did.(maybe need proper training for the wait staff to ensure they have all the food options available to them)

All in all it wasn't bad and if you don't want to wait in the buffet line (the only reason we ended up here) or you want to sit down and have food brought to you it may be right down your alley."}
{"text":"Their reuben is fine, just nothing worth coming back for. The fries are served in a cute basket. 

My server said everything here's good, so I was really nervous after reading some yelp reviews that said otherwise! It was an OK meal overall. They were out of the dessert I ordered, one of the pie desserts served in a jar. I got a different one instead and cannot remember which one! The cafe has a nice atmosphere and the menu is quite extensive. It's a nice option if you need a place open 24 hours or don't want to wait for the buffet. They have patio dining which is a great little area and probably underutilized."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. It's always been this way, I don't understand why it's so hard. Takes forever for your food to come out. If you're lonely or have nothing else to do with your life, eat here. Bring a book or your iPad. You're in for a long haul."}
{"text":"Let me start with what is a no no. We waited for 30 minutes to be seated. We were ask four times if we are a party of 4 by three different staff members. The answer: No we are a party of 3. It has not changed.
Finally seated: no one seems to know who is working what table
Our order: 3x chicken fingers with fries... keep it simple we had movie tickets.
It took 30 minutes for our food the come and the chicken fingers were cold and soggy, as they have been sitting out for a while. It's not cheap either for fast food.

Plus: We had a nice waitress. The other ones were moving sooo slow. The fries were good.
I can not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Grand Cafe? More like... BLAND cafe.

I know I'm being a little harsh, but... it's true. A lot of the food (well pretty much most of it) was bland and needed more flavor. Or it was dry. Yuck. No wonder why it was kind of cheap. 3 Course meal (appetizer, entree, dessert) for only $10! Of course, who wouldn't want to choose that?! But anyway... our first visit will probably be our last. Sad, because I heard they have the best steak and eggs in town.

I ordered a house salad (because, you can't go wrong with a house salad), pasta with chicken, and a scoop of CHOCOLATE ice cream for dessert.

While we were sitting and waiting FOREVER for our food, I looked up the reviews on yelp and I was surprised as to why someplace so nice would have such bad ratings. And then, it happened. What I read became reality. Service was super slow. Our server took forever to bring us food or refill drinks. All the servers would do behind us was talk and talk, we could hear their conversations. And get this, it was DEAD! Maybe like 3 tables. And the table that was next to us got their food and everything way before we did! #frustrating 

Finally our food came out, one after the other, but in really long intervals.

Salad- tasted like old lettuce... and the dressing taste (vinaigrette) was off.
Pasta with chicken- chicken was hard, pasta... harder, and no taste at all. It said it was alfredo, but it wasn't alfredo at all... weird taste.. I tried to at a little bit of salt. It helped a little but the only reason why I kept eating the stuff was because I was hungry.
Ice cream- we asked our desserts to-go because they were taking FOREVER and we had a wedding to get ready for... she came back with a to-go cup of ice cream... but it was vanilla.

My sister ordered a mimosa, but it tasted weird.

My sister ordered a Caesar salad (because, you can't ever go wrong with caesar salad), chicken and biscuits, and a brownie.

Caesar salad- once again, dry/old salad, and weird tasting Caesar.
Chicken and biscuits- she said it was nothing special. Biscuits were hidden... weird.
Brownie- looked stale and hard. Not sure how it tasted though cause she didn't end up eating it lol.

Needless to say, the food was just bleh and boring. Nothing grand about this place at all."}
{"text":"For the month of August they have a special and it's a good one.  For $2.99 you get 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon or sausages, hash brown and toast.  What a deal.  Filled me up.  The pressed juice is 2x to 3x more expensive than this breakfast.  And you can have it anytime.  Prices are pretty reasonable a giant stack of 2 pancakes is $3.99.  Weekends are generally busy and there's always a line outside. If you're a chairman or elite rewards card member your line is much shorter or it could be empty.  It's a huge cafe and service is pretty good.  They have a tempting bakery right as you enter with scrumpious baked goods."}
{"text":"Horrible service, long time to wait to place the order
After almost an hour cold plate is served.. 
they took it back and within 3 minutes we received it hot steam?  This is not what this restaurant been known or used to be! Big disappointment dissatisfaction"}
{"text":"Before coming here i had to say i read some of the reviews... and most of \"they\" were right... 

This place seems like it can seat over 100 people at one time, the place seems very clean and kept... it seems like it wants to do \"fancy\" look... it almost there but i'm more for clean place...  

the staff seems very friendly and most of them wants to help you and make sure you are accommodated well...  

the food... i had Newyork and bake potato with salad...  and wow
the steak was juicy 90% of the time... it was well season and juicy... i never had Newyork taste this good... i told my server i'm coming back for prime rib next year... Bake potato was warm the whole entire time and delicious.  and the salad... this is where every messes up, because no one has the time to chop it before serving... and you can tell by the evidence on the lettuce..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had some time to kill before watching a movie, so we decided to eat breakfast. We first walked to the Feast Buffet, but the lines were crazy long! Decided to try out Grand Cafe next door and we were seated right away.

The food was horrible, for me at least. I ordered the breakfast sliders - 2 sausage, egg and cheese biscuits, gravy, and hash browns. There was no gravy on my plate. The hash browns were cold, and the sliders were a hint of warm in the beginning, but turned cold pretty quickly. I really wanted to complain and send the food back to the kitchen, but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to eat. My husband, on the other hand, said that his food was good. This was actually his second visit here. The country breakfast bowl that he ordered each time was tasty and filling. So maybe there are a small number of items on the menu that are worth eating.

Service wasn't that great. Our server did not check on us very often, and she was more attentive to the table across from us. Maybe because there were 3 kids and a baby sitting at that table? The cashiers in the front were more friendly. 

I will give this place 2 stars because my husband enjoyed his food, but I won't be returning. I can't believe that sometimes there is a line here during dinner time. Thank goodness for the Yelp check in deal: 1 free entree with purchase of an entree. If I had to pay full price, I would have been upset. DO NOT waste your time and money here! Waiting in line for the buffet would definitely be a wiser choice."}
{"text":"This review is of the dessert case only. I bake and am pretty particular about my desserts and have to say I really like the choices and taste of everything we have gotten.  The carrot cake was fresh and the frosting still soft and I love the peanut stack which is like a snicker cake sorta."}
{"text":"This was my first experience of Las Vegas food, which I kept hearing was legit. Unfortunately, this was a bad initial impression. 

First of all, it took over and hour and a half for our table of 4 to get our food. The waitress was absent for that entire time, and when the food finally came, we were told that the chef popped one of my poached eggs. First of all, an update would have been nice, as my brother was getting married in a few hours and chose this restaurant based on convenience in the first place. Second of all, unless the chef had to run to the store to get a new egg, that doesn't explain more than 5 minutes of delay. Heck they could have served both of them popped and I wouldn't have cared.

The food was also pretty bad. Eggs Benedict are made or broken based on the Hollandaise sauce, and this one had a very unpleasant chemically taste. I will say that others at the table seemed reasonably satisfied."}
{"text":"I gotta hand it to Robert. He saved this place from a 1-star rating. I left him a big tip because of his great personality and customer service.

2 years ago I first came here. I waited about 10 minutes to get a seat even though I was first in line. After they sat me, I waited about 15 minutes for a server to come around. I tried to get the attention of the angry old blonde woman who works behind the cash register and she practically told me to eat a d*ck and get lost. When the server finally showed up, he was one of those  white dudes who speaks in Ebonics. I couldn't understand a word he was trying to tell me.  My food came out around 30 minutes later, and the server never came around to refill my drink. 

Last night I came here for the graveyard special. I expected the same bad service and I was correct in my expectations. It took about 5 minutes for the host to come over and attempt to seat me. The host first took us to a table that still had a half eaten pancake on it. She then tried to seat us at another table that had a person still sitting in it. She then tried to seat us at another table that still had 4 plates, dirty napkins, and bottles of beer on it. Obviously there was something wrong with the host and busers here. She then sat us at a table which was far off in a corner.

Once again like in years past, we waited about 15 minutes for service. As we were waiting for service we could see all the other servers goofing off, laughing, and horse-playing. Two servers were playing tag and slapping each other in the legs while we were just sitting there waiting for someone to at least ask us what we wanted to drink. Something about seeing the workers playing like children and laughing out loud in enjoyment while the customers are miserable and waiting for service is just FUBAR...  I went to that same angry blond old lady at the cashier and she once again gave us a dirty look and practically told us to eat a d*ck and get lost. She hasn't changed at all in the last 2 years. 

Finally, after another 5 minutes there was a series of angry attacks from other guests. One guest starting screaming profanity loudly and began hassling the manager.  A man and woman at a different table got so angry that they threw their menu and utensils on the floor and stormed out while giving the servers the royal finger.  I on the other hand was not that angry because I have lived in Las Vegas for a long time and ALWAYS expect bad service. Bad service is just a normal aspect of Las Vegas life. If I don't get bad service, that's when I am usually most surprised. I just endure the bad service and never leave a  tip. But, things began to turn around. The manager finally noticed that the whole restaurant was about to riot and ran into the kitchen and found a worker who did a great job solving the situation. We got a server named Robert who provided us excellent customer service and also got the manager to comp our meal. He even got our food out extremely fast. I really appreciate his hard work. 

Will I be back? I sure will. I love graveyard specials and am willing to endure the bad service. It actually saves us all money when we get bad service because we don't tip. But, I'm more than happy to tip Robert a 20 if I get him as a server again."}
{"text":"Of course, you get what you pay for. I am a big fan of late night specials because they are just so god darn cheap! When you are hungry at 3 or so in the morning, it really doesn't matter what you eat at this point. The $1.99 pancakes were okay. They just taste like flour. If you drench it in enough butter and syrup, it tastes much better! lol I had the $7.99 steak and eggs. They were cooked perfectly, but they just tasted like char. With enough A1 and salt/pepper, you'll be just fine. The hash browns were not crispy. 

The bloody mary on the other hand was very good! 

I can't complain about the service because there was only one gal working 10 tables and she was actually very hardworking. They should staff more servers on these Saturday nights."}
{"text":"So I waited a day to post how horribly awful #GrandCafe is and should be closed!  I ordered steak & eggs there. When it comes out the smell was so bad the person sitting 3 down from me could smell the rancid stinch.  When I say something I got a crazy look from the waitress.  She has another waiter smell it and he looked crazy. I'm sorry the waitress and the cook should both be fired. There is no way in hell they did not smell that steak was bad. I have been around rotten dead animals and it smelled worse than that. Then I ordered something different and it took 15 mins to come out.  No manager ever came over. This is the 2nd and final bad experience there. I will never set foot in that restaurant again."}

Host took us to our table which was still being cleaned, we asked if we could sit in the booth (clean and available), Ruben the host was not pleased. He made a comment under his breath and we shrugged it off but we didn't appreciate the sarcasm."}
