{"text":"The menu, although interesting, and full of potential, I found the food a bit bland. 

The service... apparently is hit and miss.  Although many have had good impressions... I left annoyed.  I was pretty much ignored and when not ignored, got the clear sense that my presence was a nuisance and the staff had more important things to do (eg return to talking amongst themselves and ignoring customers). 

The music.... And I've noticed this with a number of gastro pubs.... was simply too loud.  It was set at 'club volume' not 'gastro pub' volume.  I want to dine and discuss... not dance and listen.  If I wanted the latter, I would pay half the price, and get nachos and a student dive.  Why do gastro pubs do this.  Quit trying to be 'cool'.... you're ruining the key benefit of what you're supposed to be all about."}
{"text":"This newly-opened venture from Bohmer is a casual space for drinks, snacks, and dinner. With its windows wide open and welcoming on this mild summer night, I try a few dishes to see how things are going in the first week of operation. ( ** 2.5 **)

Muted lighting and wide tables make for a very comfortable dinner, and almost required when all our dishes land on the table in the span of 5 minutes. We did say that they should bring it as it comes!

Deep-Fried Smelts
Enjoyed the fried smelts, dusted with whole-wheat flour. Crispy, light, and a great snack. Sided with caper mayo served in a cute mini bail-closure jar.

Pig's Ears
They had pig's ears, so of course I had to get them. They came looking almost like dried tofu sheets. Light and crunchy, these are not in the slightest bit chewy like I was expecting them to be. Still good and salty and piggy.

Potato Funnel Cake
Served with chives and crème fraîche, this was just too oily. Not sure if the oil just wasn't hot enough, but each crunchy tentacle of dough was saturated with oil. Would make a good beer snack if they can fix that oil issue.

Maultacshen
A lamb-shoulder ravioli in lamb broth. In theory, something I'd love. In practice, not so much. I felt like there was this cheese-element to it that was throwing it all off.

Tarte Flambée: Rabbit Goulosh
The rabbit was pretty bland, but tomato-tangy goulosh was pleasant. What killed it was the crust - it was crunchy and hard. Their dough needs work.

Pear Tarte Tatin
This was really lovely; not too big, nice crust, just-done pears. The caramelized sugar disc was a nice decorative touch, but inedible. Very pretty. I was full, but still glad I ordered this.

Looking back on what I ordered, I feel like I should have got the pickles to balance out the amount of oily and fried foods I had. By the end of it, even with the funnel cake only half-done, I was greased-out.

Currently open 7-days a week and open late, I hope they refine and work the kinks out. Worth another visit in a few weeks to re-evaluate!"}
{"text":"When the Bohemian Gastropub opened, I was really excited to try it. However, that excitement didn't last very long. When we first arrived at the restaurant, we were just standing there dumbly for a while...nobody came to approach or acknowledge us. When my friend finally went to talk to the bartender, asking if we should seat ourselves, he gave us a look as if to say \"duh\" and impatiently said yes. Okay...

So, we started with the Four Spiced Confit Chicken Wings - with house made bbq sauce ($12). The wings, while really tiny in size, were actually decent. The bbq sauce was nice but I wish they had coated the wings in them rather than simply placing a small pool of sauce at the bottom of the plate. It came with a small side of fries, which were actually quite tasty.

Everything just went downhill after this. We tried the Braised Lamb Shank - roasted winter vegetables and braised white beans, natural jus ($14). We were actually debating between the ribs and the lamb and asked the server for his opinion and said \"definitely the lamb.\" I'm afraid what the ribs would have tasted like...

As much as I like lamb, this lamb shank was incredibly bland and wasn't as tender as I would have liked. It really needed some sort of sauce or some seasoning. The menu indicated that the dish came with a natural jus. It certainly tasted like it was cooked au naturel, as though they took it straight from the butcher and cooked it without doing anything to it.

The last thing we tried was the House Made Currywurst Sausage - Grandma Boehmer's mango chutney, pain au lait ($10). The sausage was okay, but we found the bun to taste a little stale (kinda hard and crumbly) and we didn't find the mango chutney to go very well with the sausage.

What a disappointing experience. I so badly wanted to like it too!"}
{"text":"I so desperately want to give this place more stars - but unfortunately cannot.  My BF and I went in Aug11 when this place had recently opened and were very excited to try it out.  The enviornment was trendy and nice, however I found it to be unimaginative as this \"look\" is everywhere and slightly trying to hard.  We ordered a few drinks and got the potato funnel cake (too oily and slightly bland) and the fried Zucchini dumplings.  Something was missing, the dumplings were flavourless, even the cheddar had minimal flavour.  We very politely informed the waitress of our thoughts and suggestions who graciously listened.  We have not returned since as I think there are better options near by (namely 416 snack bar)."}
{"text":"Note: I've heard that the menu has been completely overhauled since my visit, so take this review with a grain of salt.

Tried this place out with a friend the other day. The service was good, the atmosphere  relaxing.

My friend recommended the pickles and I naturally accepted. I also drifted toward the pig ears, the idea of which repulsed my friend. The pickles were delightful: a lovely melange of onions, grapes, carrots, and so forth. Sweet and sour and delicious. The pig ears were crispy, like porky chips, and came with a tangy and complementary tartar. My friend was quickly bowled over by them, to my delight. 

Next, we had one of their flatbread pizzas with the rabbit goulash, which was succulent, and my friend tried a sausage, which I also sampled and liked, but we noted that having been to Wvrst, sausages elsewhere tend to fall flat. 

Overall, I was happy with it and would love to go again to try the rest of the dishes--particularly the starters."}
{"text":"A new place opened up on Queen Street that my wife and I were looking forward to trying, The Bohemian Gastropub.

When we walked in and sat down, we were immediately greeted by our server, who provided us with a menu and took our drink order. We had a table by the window great for people watching, which we like to do. 

Our drinks came right away, but were had not yet decided what to order. Then our server disappeared and forgot about us.

The Bohemian Gastropub has a very good selection of craft beers on tap. The problem after the first round was finding our server to order another. We were starving and had told our server that, but it took him forever to come back to take our order.

My wife had Southern Fried Buttermilk Chicken with Mashed Potatoes. I ordered the fish and chips which I was looking forward to as the fish was trout. I had never had trout fish and chips before.

My wifes chicken came out and it was one small chicken breast sitting on mashed potatoes spread around the plate. For $16 I would think there should be 2 breasts. She said the batter was tasteless.

My fish was a disappointment. The chips come already lightly salted and were quite good. The fish batter was bland and the fish soggy and tasteless. I decided some salt might help but none of the tables had salt, which I had to chase the server for. It came in a bottle with a small wooden spoon which was interesting.

Definitely not worth the $16 it cost.

I found the beer to be a very reasonable price though. Most pints were just $6 with some premium pints pouring for $7.

I would stop in and sit at the bar for a beer but would not order food again......or sit a table and wait for a server."}
{"text":"After Gord and I saw The Rum Diary this afternoon, we walked to the Bohemian Gastropub on Queen Street W for supper. It opened in July and we've been wanting to check it out.

It's a cute spot ... there's also a big room in the back.  We sat by the window so had a great spot for people watching on Queen Street W.

Our server came over right away and asked up what we wanted to drink and was quick about getting them to us. Then the service went downhill. We had made it obvious that we would be ordering food but it took him a long time to come back. When we tried to catch his attention, he was indifferent to our needs.

I ordered the Southern Fried Buttermilk Chicken and Mashed Potatoes.  At $16, it's expensive for what you get. A thin layer of mashed potatoes and a small boneless chicken breast. The batter was fairly bland.

Gord ordered Battered Fish and Chips.  Surprisingly it's trout rather than the usual cod, haddock or halibut. At $16, this too is fairly expensive for what you get. The fries were good. Gord said the fish was mushy and not great.

Given the cost of the food, we were surprised at the low cost of drinks. A draft is $6 or $7 and a rum and coke was $6.25.

We both agreed we couldn't go back to eat there again. Gord loves beer so was happy with the beer selection and said he'd go back for a drink. There's enough bars on Queen Street W that I'd be inclined to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"came here for some pints and a few classes of shiraz. very nice date place with a comfortable and clean atmosphere. service was very good. would return for drinks. have yet to order food from here."}
