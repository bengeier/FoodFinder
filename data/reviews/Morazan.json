{"text":"Love this place! We've been going at least once a month for the last year. I think this location used to be an old Clock restaurant. Inside is nothing fancy...they put their efforts into the food. Even though there are screens, we've never been there when it was loud. It gives us a chance to enjoy the food as well as having a conversation. 

We've had the Salvadorean steak, Chile Rellano, and chicken fajitas to name a few. All have been wonderfully tasty. 

Service is timely and they check back regularly to see if you have enough to drink.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Admittedly the nostalgia I was feeling  toward Latin American food may have clouded my judgment, but even my usually picky boys and mom were singing its praises. The parrillada morazan was a feast of deliciously flavored grilled meats. Loved it."}
{"text":"I really did not plan on eating Mexican/Salvadoran/Honduran last night. Our favorite and second favorite pho destinations were inexplicably closed and Morazon beckoned from barely a parking lot away. Don't let the converted fast food location and uncrowded interior fool you.    Morazan is worth seeking out. We pointed randomly and did not try a quesadilla, taco or burrito (although all are on the long, colorful menu). We had plantains stuffed with meat, beans, cheese (highly recommend) puposas and few other randomly selected items  I can not remember. Nothing was over $4 - and these are not small plates- another than the gigantic shrimp ceviche at $10. Ice water came with limes -I love little things like hat. Service was gone a lot but very friendly. Would have liked a few more menu suggestions for people clearly out of place like us. The manager did stop by our table to check-in which was a nice touch. Give this place a try for an affordable trip to Mexican/South American cusine."}
{"text":"Wow, everything was great!   We regularly go to the Vietnam Grille which is next door (and is also great).    From the outside, it looks questionable.  Once you go inside, it looks like a former Shomars.   The Menu is vast!  It starts with Mexican dishes, and moves into Honduran cuisine.  Nachos were ok,  and salsa was sweet.  We had Saut√©ed shrimp, and Burritos, and they were delicious!  Even the rice and beans were really good!  The prices were good too.  My Steak Burrito was $7  and was so big I took part of it home.    We will be going back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Yelpers haven't found this place! My roommate and I have been wanting to try something new and this place was always a mystery so we gave it a shot. 

Don't let the outside scare you. It looks a little dumpy and even looks a little dumpy and cold when you get inside. Trust me, stick with it and put a jacket on in the winter. 

We ordered a side of sweet fried plantains as an appetizer. There were at least 25 pieces for $2.99 and they were delicious. 

Our food came out on large white square plates and our presentation was very nice. Our food was phenomenal and everything was really unique too. Our bills were only $10 split both ways and we had a lot of leftovers. 

After just going to Ruth's Chris for restaurant week and spending $50 on a meteokre meal, I was reminded that good food and fellowship can happen over a $10 meal too. Definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican and have lately come away disappointed with many other Mexican places.  This place was recommended by another Yelper.  

This is in an old McDonald's building on South Blvd but you may notice the resemblance on the outside but inside they did a great job in transforming the space.  There are several booths and also a full bar.  And not only do they serve Mexican food but they also serve Honduran food.

Just like any Mexican place, you receive you complimentary chips and salsa.  While the salsa was mild, the flavors were amazing.  And adding just a bit of hot sauce which is available on your table, made this a killer salsa!

I was in on my lunch hour and noticed the lunch specials.  I have also been straying from my normal vegetarian diet the entire week and decided to do it again here.  I was craving chorizo anyway.   I went with the tacos which came with 3 of your choice of meat.  I picked 2 chicken and 1 chorizo.  The plate was beautifully presented.  It came with pico de gallo, pickled onions, a tomatillo sauce, a roasted leak and a roasted pepper.  The pepper was mild but it was huge.  

The tacos were amazing.  Some of the best tacos I've had at a Mexican place. Chunked chicken and chorizo and adding the toppings and some hot sauce made the flavors dance in my mouth.  I think i just found my new favorite Mexican place.  I just need to come back and try their Honduran options.  It also looks like they have a good selection of vegetarian options so I will definitely be trying those as well.

One other thing.  They were cheap!  $7 for 3 beautifully presented tacos?  Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Love the entire menu here! A variety of Latin food for everyone!! Muy buen restaurante y servicio. I highly recommend it and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good place for families & children who won't eat anything that's not American yet. We laugh at the soap operas on tv that we can't understand. Decent South American food for very reasonable prices. Our last visit wasn't so great, as there were NO margaritas!  Also, the waitresses spent much more time gossiping than waiting on tables. One of our orders was wrong and our food took a very long time as it was sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen for much too long."}
