{"text":"So I gave Pomo Pizzeria Gilbert only four stars because I like the atmosphere of the downtown Phoenix location better - and they didn't have Stella so I settled for a Coors Light.  With that said, I ordered the Toto Sapore pizza and it was absolutely fantastic!  I did sit out on the patio which was quite relaxing and nice.  I absolutely recommend Pomo Pizzeria and will be back - often!"}
{"text":"If you like Domino or Pizza Hut just stay home! This is authentic Napoletani style pizza pie.. They have a very short cook time in an very hot oven! The Principe pizza is my Favorite pie it has tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto crudo parma, arugula, shaved parmigiano, basil, evoo... Just perfection!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly but food was okay. The pasta was kind of bland for my taste and pizza was a bit too greasy for me. Not worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Eeehhh it was ok .... Price doesn't match the food, I had a pasta and it was ok, the sauce was good but I would skip on that pasta ... My boyfriend order a pizza and it wasn't that great for the price... Too pricey for us and the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time, I was excited to try out a new Italian place in Gilbert. I think they might still be working some kinks out like most new restaurants do. The pizza was pretty good the crust was great! The house made pasta was just ok... I think for what we paid I had higher expectations. Hopefully they can work on a couple things and we will return."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. Too bad they end at the end of the month.  Hope October has great specials to.  Love the prickly pear margarita!!! Zucchini fries, yummy."}
{"text":"I had big hopes for Pomo. It is certified to be authentic Napolitano style pizza. The location is cramped and it was rather loud. The mural on the wall of Naples Italy was quite authentic - even down to trash in the street. We ordered our pizzas. A very basic margarita pizza for one (2 if you eat like a bird) is $12.95. We got 2 pizzas and one glass of iced tea (I had water) and the tab was $31.15 + tip.   Now for the pizza review. Meh. It tasted good. There was hardly any cheese on it. Little sauce (although it had good flavor).  In all honesty - go to Trader Joe's. In their freezer section, they have organic pizza imported from Italy. The flavor is very comparable, the crust is slightly thicker, there's more cheese. They cost about 5 bucks each. Grab 2, and a bottle of 2 buck Chuck wine (which will be the same price as one pizza at Pomo), add a salad, invite over a couple of friends and have a great time.   Oh - FYI - I feel the same about Pizza Bianco in Phoenix. Overrated, very, very, very similar taste to the imported Trader Joe's pizza.   I won't be going back to either place."}
{"text":"I live in Chandler and have recently discovered the great downtown Gilbert area, which beats our downtown silly for food and things to do! What a pleasant surprise. Tonight we tried Pomo and it's a great addition to the area.   My wife had Tagliatelle Bolognese and gave it rave reviews -- less authentic restaurants would smother it with too much sauce, but from what I could see, it was just the right amount. And the peas are an interesting addition.   I chose the Carpaccio di Bresaola, which is arugula on a bed of carpaccio, with parmesan. It was delicious... nearly as good as the exact same salad I had in Venice a couple of weeks ago. The only slight changes I'd make would be to tone down the lemon vinaigrette and add a little more parmesan to offset the pepperiness of the arugula. Still, really nicely done.   I saw that Pomo has an Aperol Spritz on the drinks menu and went for one of those. It's just as good as any you'll find in Italy.   Finally, kudos for the level of service. Attentive but not fawning. And the mural of the street scene in Napoli makes for a great view as you eat."}
{"text":"Tried out Pomo with some friends last night.  We had a great time and were excited to try out one of the newer restaurants in Gilbert.     We had a 30 minute wait on a Wednesday, so we bellied up to the outside bar while we waited for our table to be ready.  The pom Lemondrop was amazing.  Refreshing, well made, but a small serving for the price.  It won't stop me from ordering it again, just wish it were a larger size.  Deserts were also great.  We got 4 different ones between us and they were all better than we expected.  The appetizer caprese was under seasoned (well, not seasoned) and came with a broken balsamic vinegar dispenser instead of a reduction already applied.  This created a mess on our table, our plates and our hands.  The waitress admitted that it was broken when we pointed it out to her, but the damage was done.  The pizzas were only okay.  My friends who shared the Margherita pizza said it was bland and had no seasoning on it.  I shared the sausage and mushroom white pizza.  It had good flavor, but was light on toppings and was very oily due to the cheese and mushrooms.  The pesto is amazing, however, so make sure you order some of that to go with the bread ( hat they charge $2 for).    We were also disappointed that they 'served' canned parmesan cheese, as we all expected fresh ground since they claim to be authentic Italian.  The service was friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was fun, but with mediocre food I'm not sure if we will be rushing back.  It may end up being a good happy hour stop though."}
{"text":"Best little casual Italian dining in Old Town Gilbert.  I crave the Porcini pizza, thin crust Sicilian style pizza with imported porcini mushroom, eggplant Parmesan that melts in your mouth and Nutella chocolate flourless cake! Always great service!"}
{"text":"Great service! Our server, Chris B, was awesome! He took time to explain the menu. He was friendly and never made us feel rushed. I want his section again!!  The food was GREAT too! Loved this place!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this location! There's always such great service and tonight our server Maurizio was impeccable! So observant and very funny! His presence was wonderful and my group enjoyed all his stories about his travels- definitely made the night worth it. The pizza was delicious and of course had to top the night with the best tiramisu in all of Gilbert! Highly recommend this place for any occasion."}
{"text":"Went to downtown Gilbert on Saturday... wait time at Zin was 1+ hour, same at Oreganos. Pomo's wait time was 45m but seated us after 15. We ordered the Peppino pizza at it was amazing. Nice charred crust from the pizza oven - lovely flavor. The basil, ricotta, sauce & spicy salami was perfectly balanced and far better than what we would have gotten at Oreganos. But, it was the pasta that blew us away...STROZZAPRETI ALLA SALSICCIA. Perfectly cooked homemade pasta with a hearty meat sauce that was just simply delicious. After our first bite, we just kind of looked at each other like... \"what is this????\" It was seriously the best pasta dish I've ever had. Waiter was not attentive, was rushing everywhere he went, and never check in --- But who cares! When the food is that good, I can easily overlook it."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a girl's night, we called ahead and still waited 45 mins to sit outside. The waiter was very nice but rarely checked in. As for the pizza.. terrible! It was soggy and barely warm. I came home to my husband who ordered dominos for himself and it was 10x better than this place! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best values in the southeast valley. The food is great, great pizza oven, great service and ambiance.  Alex, the GM comes out every time to greet all the guests and make each of us feel at home. The atmosphere reminds me of one of our favorite restaurants in Rocky Point, every customer that comes on is greeted the same way \"welcome home\". Way to go Alex, feels like home!  Will"}
{"text":"We were very happy that  we were able find/order a pizza for my son who has a lot of food allergies!  We called first and spoke with the manager and he was very helpful.  We ordered him a gluten free and dairy free pizza...my son really liked it and I actually liked it as well.  The only reason why I couldn't give this place (for this rating) 5 stars is because, we had to wait for a while for a table even though there were a lot of tables that were available (the restaurant was not full)...I guess they were short staffed that night (I'm not sure).  Another reason is, I ordered their lasagna and it was good until I got to the middle of it and it was really cold...like, frozen cold.  I told our server (who I think was the manager) if they can heat up my food.  He apologized, took the lasagna and told me they are making a new one for me.  He also took it out of bill - I did not expect that but I appreciate."}
{"text":"I live across the street and have been eagerly waiting for Pomo to open. I just left and couldn't wait to write my review. SO delicious! The ambience is awesome and the food and service are just as great. We ordered bruschetta (probably the best I've ever had) and 2 pizzas. We sat in the patio and as my nephew was biting into his pizza, he noticed a mosquito stuck in dough. Obviously, that's not surprising seeing how we were sitting outside. We told our server about it and asked if maybe we can just replace a slice. They actually remade the entire pizza and didn't charge for either of them! Totally unnecessary but they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Also, they have a delicious peach tea. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pomo pizza is the best Napoletana style pizza. It does NOT compare to Oreganos or any pizza place. They make delicious appetizers as well and they have white pizzas and the red sauce pizzas. Delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting from out of town recently we were told of the amazing service and food at Pomo, we took our family here with high expectations but left very disappointed. While our server was attentive, we couldn't help but over hear a conversation from a young man who we later found out was on the managment team. This conversation was very personal and in my opinion an unprofessional one to be had at work. I just wanted to voice my concerns to higher management as I would hope this isn't direct refection of this establishment and it's professionalism."}
{"text":"I am always excited to try new restaurants. I wasn't very excited to try this place and now I know why. I don't understand how so many people gave this place 4 or 5 stars.   So the menu selection was very disappointing. Ordered the mista salad and that was plain nothing special. ordered margherita \"cheese\" pizza which was very plain as well just nothing special but the 90 second cook time was pretty fabulous. Capellini pasta was nothing special as well just pasta with tomato sauce it seems. everything was overpriced for what you got. Overall not impressed and not worth a second visit in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here on a tuesday night and by 6:00 they were gearing up for a busy night.  We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer, they were good but mushy, plenty of sauce.  Ordered bread separately to enjoy the sauce with.  My husband got a pizza and I got carbonara.  I can embrace it was a busy night, but my carbonara came out curdled!  I chose not to send it back because it took quite a long time to come in the first place.  My husband's pizza came out well executed but flat on flavors.  I accept that he chose a more mundane menu option, but the sauce barely cut through the heaviness of the salami and sausage.  The server was lovely, the music was sporadic and the patio seating was nice.  It just didn't hit all the marks for us!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did, especially because there's so much hype around it. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed. I had the Pollo salad, which was okay, but at $14 dollars, was way overpriced for what you got (a few strips of chicken with grape tomatoes and pine nuts). I feel it was quite bland. Actually, that was sorta what I got from the whole experience. I also tried a piece of my friend's Margherita pizza. I was initially excited because the crust was delicious. It had a wonderful crisp on the outside, with a fluffy chewiness inside. Unfortunately, the sauce and toppings really didn't compliment the greatness of the crust. The tomato sauce was again, quite bland. And the basil was mostly burnt, so there was little flavor associated.   Perhaps I will give them another shot at their Phoenix location, as it's closer to my house. Try another one of the pizzas and hopefully they can change my mind. For now though, I'm content having at least tried it."}
{"text":"A bit expensive for what you're getting. Had to ask for cheese to complement our dishes. Bread is an extra, service ok."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently discovered the downtown Gilbert area and wanted to try something new for dinner. I had a craving for pizza so I thought we could give Pomo a try. We loved the atmosphere and the service was great! The best part was the food. We had the bruschetta to start which was delicious and then chose the Pomo pizza which was delicious also. Everything tastes authentic. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I brought some friends from out of town to try this new restaurant.  Because my wife is gluten intolerant, I called the day before to make sure they had a GF pizza.  I was told they had run out of of GF pizza dough but would definitely have it the next day by lunch.  So, my wife was very excited to go only to find out when we arrived with our party they were out of dough.  She settled for a salad.  Let me just say that my pizza was a Heavenly experience and everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their food.  My wife said the salad was good as well.  We told the waiter we had called the day before and only came by for the GF pizza.  While he should have comped the meal, the manager did when we sent them an email.  They apologized profusely and said they would mail us a gift card to come back and try the GF pizza again.  Hopefully, we get the gift card.  Food was great.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our first experience was Pomo DT and we loved it!  Authentic Italy style pizza and fresh ingredients.  We tried the one in Gilbert this weekend.  Food was good.  My 3 star rating is because I have pet peeves when it comes to service.  When a restaurant is not busy (even if they are) PLEASE CLEAR MY TABLE !  I have made a commitment to myself and other Yelpers that I will no longer accept BAD service - as ACCEPTABLE.  So here I am writing a meh review for Gilbert Pomo.  Not bc their food is bad but because their service was below a level that should be acceptable."}
{"text":"Fast service and great food. Came in tonight and Brett was super friendly and attentive. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Tuesday night for the first time. Disappointing that happy hour is confined to the 11 bar stools; we were 5 feet away from empty seats and had to pay $7 for a beer- lame. Pizza was okay- not worth the $17 for some sausage and chunks of canned mushrooms- joked with my wife that we could each get 3 Little Caesar's for the same price! Lol. For two adults and a kid, way too pricey for what we got. Call it Naples- style pizza or whatever, but it was pretty bland and average at best.   Should have gone for taco Tuesday at their sister- restaurant, Joyride; at least happy hour is honored everywhere in that restaurant and I would have ordered more than one drink."}
{"text":"Sucked.  Cardboard pizza, soggy sourdough bread and slow service.  As we walked down the street, every restaurant was packed except this one - no wonder.  Oregano's is 20 yards away with better menu options, better food and service."}
{"text":"Very charming Italian restaurant with a variety of items. Especially great if you have food allergies. Staff is very friendly and always willing to help! My new fav spot!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I am just finding out about this place after living in Gilbert for almost a year. The pizza is phenomenal, even my 11 year old said this is the best Pizza he has ever eaten! Brett was one of the best waiters we have ever had. Thanks for a great experience! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but I won't be returning after watching the owner disrespect the employees my entire dinner. He was loud, calling out orders and at one point I thought he was a drunk guest."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to leave reviews, however I used to frequent this location after work every Friday and I loved the atmosphere and the happy hour. The bar staff was so personable and fun. I stopped going a few months ago due to my office relocation. I was on the side of town and was really looking forward to a visit. I was really disappointed when I realized that the dynamic duo was no longer there. Alex and Alexa always took the time to get to know us and were extremely helpful. I was surprised I was able to get a seat at the bar so quickly. I must admit it was nice however it must be a sign that culture has shifted. I was really missing the friendly, fast, and efficient duo; but I still enjoyed the house red."}
{"text":"Super cute ambiance. Outside seating is cool, even in 100 degree heat. Tentative but not overly bearing staff. Our server didn't really know the difference between vegan and vegetarian, so she recommended several options that weren't really options. She got it right by dessert, though.   It was nice to have a vegan pizza option with daiya cheese. That being said, it was just ok. It lacked flavor. (Edit: it was much more flavorful the next day after it had cooled!) The crust was nice, thin, and soft. I did like being able to dine out with friends and not have to order a salad.   Overall cute place but nothing I was super excited about. Four stars because it's not a vegan restaurant  but it has a decent vegan option."}
{"text":"Our first time at Pomo, but already knew how great the pizza was. Had to give it a try, and it was amazing!! The service was awesome( Jimmy)  was our server and was on point!!! Will definitely be back!! So glad Pomo made it to downtown Gilbert .."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and have the say the pizza was basic, BUT the pasta was outstanding.  The low raiting is based on the restaurant set up.  The place is too small and they  have too many tables side by side.  So no privacy and you can hear what everyone else is saying.  Service was basic but I contribute that to being new.  Another big issue was happy hour prices were only available if you sat at the bar.  I don't understand that conceipt especially since the bar was a foot from our table."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Gilbert location, it seemed like the menu was a little different but the pizza was still awesome."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The location, the service, the menu, the bar.  The pizza was excellent. The crust was perfect,  the toppings and sauce did not overwhelm it.  This is a WOW place."}
{"text":"Pizza was so good! Cocktails were amazing! Quick and good service will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this is certified pizza napolitana. It was nothing like pizza in Napoli. The crust was too thin and crispy all the way through. Also the pasta was way over cooked and drowning in sauce. I was  hoping for a  taste of Italy and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I grew up on salt, my mom was from the south. With that said, all 3 dishes we ordered were so salty we could only eat one of them. We let the server know, and they brought us an alternative but left the terrible one on our check, which not caring avout the money, vut the principle, tacky move. Clearly we had barely eaten any of it.  The server was friendly and apologetic, she might have been new so I'll give a pass on the poor judgement.  I get that there aren't a lot of Italian options in the area because I've tried them all, but extremely dissapoointed. I gave 2 stars because ambience was nice, resteraunt was clean and organized, and employees were kind."}
{"text":"Quality pizza for a decent price.   Local produce.  Imported meat and cheese.  Great service.  Pizza cooks in 90 seconds but much better than all the new instant pizza places.  We shared 3 pizzas for 5 people. Will go back to try some other stuff including the pastas and salads."}
{"text":"This restaurant has not only good food but the best customer service ever. They have vegan & gluten free options, which is amazing. We went with two special needs kids and they were wonderful. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was excellent,  atmosphere  not so good,  food even worse.  I ordered a Marguerite pizza,  it was tasteless and the crust was like eating a cheap steak, chewy.   It was super loud , hard to have a conversation. But I find most restaurants are  loud lately. I doubt  I'll return, if I do, I'll select outdoor seating on the patio where there is a misting system. And probably  less noisy."}
{"text":"We went yesterday for lunch for my mom's birthday. They were in from out of town and requested pizza. I called ahead and made reservations. The girl on the phone was really nice and accommodating. I got a text confirmation and even 5 mins before we arrived we got a text saying our table was ready. We were immediately greeted by our waiter Denzel who went ABOVE and BEYOND for us!! He put forth so much time and effort into our party of 8. Not to mention the food that was amazing!! Magherita pizza, Divola mango salad and something else I could remember but was awesome. Denzel made our day!! Thank you so much!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service by Lauren was magnificent! Lauren was attentive, listened to our needs and followed up and checked on us.  Great flavors and yummy options!  We ordered the Kale salad, the Strozzapreti alla Salsiccia pasta  and  Peppino Pizza!   Will come back!"}
{"text":"I really thought their pizza was going to be amazing, and I wanted to like it, but honestly it was nothing to write home about. The margherita pizza actually tasted quite salty.. I'm not sure if it was the sauce or if they actually put salt on it.   The staff was friendly and it's a cool atmosphere, but I don't think it's worth the price for their pizza. Perhaps I'll visit again and try a different dish."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Poma and won't be the last! All the flavors came together perfectly with the pizza we ordered.  The EVOO - I could have drank -  so delicious!  For an appetizer we chose the saffron rice balls, equally amazing.  Server, Mark, was super friendly, attentive but not overwhelming or pushy.  Yes, you can get cheaper food elsewhere  but without a doubt, at Pomo you get what you pay for and the quality here is top notch.  Gilbert, you got it right with this new restaurant addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"Had great service, nice atmosphere, great date night Pizzeria, love the look of the wood oven, pie was great. But let's get down to it, one nibble everyone knows the laws! This is isn't New York style but I got the margherita pizza, excellent sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil ... it's fancy pizza, Tuxedo pizza as they say, big fan... 7.5 is the score."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza!   They have achieved the perfect crust with great flavor and perfect texture.   I had the Diavola and my wife,  the Quatro Stagione.  But we're amazing.   She said it was the best pizza she ever had.   I say it is certainly better than Pizzeria Bianco.    The Romano kale salad however was uninspired - pieces of kale, romaine and Romano cheese with almost no dressing.   Therfore, only 4 stars.  But,  hey, we didn't come for the salad.   Best pizza in town! !"}
{"text":"Tasty authentic pizza. Salad dressing is light and perfect on kale salad. Ricotta cheese and cannoli dessert are spot on. I called in advance for a party of 8 and the manager was super helpful and reserved us a table."}
{"text":"Cute place with tables and booths. We started with the bruscheta which was fresh and flavorful. We enjoyed a glass of house wine for 4 dollars for happy hour all day Sundays during the summer. The meatball appetizer was tasty, three small meatballs with a fresh basil tomato sauce that was tasty enough to fight over! We aso tried the lasagna and a pizza. Both were terrific and freshly made for our pleasure. The pizza is thin crust but still doughy and soft which is the way the menu describes as the way it is intended to be. We enjoyed our meal, the service was great and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Great place in downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We loved the location, music and menu. The waiter with his authentic Italian accent did a perfect job. I had an Italian Spritz followed by a Bufala Versace Pizza (so hard to find good Mozzarella in Arizona and to find a pizza crust cooked to perfection)... Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is bomb diggity! The pizza is somewhat small to share, and the price a bit steep with that in mind, but the ingredients are fresh and delicious!   They have an assortment of fun unique options, the atmosphere is very relaxing and casual, service was on point and even a little entertaining. Plus they offer a pint of beer with pizza for like $25 Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"We went to a farmers market and afterwards needed to grab a bite to eat, we walked down the quaint downtown street and stopped in at Pomo.  We had never been nor heard of it but were greeted with smiles and sat promptly.  Chris was our server and gave us great recommendations after he learned it was our first time here.  He gave us the low down on how the pizza was cooked as well as the fantastic options we had.  The food looked fantastic as we watched it come out get delivered to our neighboring tables...we were anxious!  It was well worth the wait and the portions were perfect!  Thanks Chris for the excellent service and recommendations!"}
{"text":"Pasta was really good.  Pizza was ok.  Maybe I am just not a fan of the 'authentic' style but it left me wanting more.  Tasted good but not the best I've ever had.  Bruschetta appetizer was good."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? This place is fantastic and the service is phenomenal. I had called ahead to put my name on the list for a larger party. Upon arrival, my name wasn't on the waiting list 2 hours after calling, the staff apologized and put us back next in line. We had to wait an hour extra, but the servers kept coming out to check on us and provide drinks. Once we entered to our table, Pomo had set up a variety of free appetizers for us as their way of saying sorry, not only that, the waitress that was serving us was probably one of the best that I've had in awhile! The food is incredible, the appetizers were amazing, and the desserts were fantastic. Pomo definitely showed us that they cared and I commend them on their respect and admiration towards their customers. Will definitely come back in the future!   Do not miss out on this place."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night for a friend's birthday party and left feeling so disappointed. The food was terrible but the service was great. My husband had the lasagna and he had me take a bite. It was worse than what comes out of a can. It was limp and flavorless. I ordered the basciola pizza and the mushrooms were so slimy I almost gagged. Again, no flavor! The croutons in my salad were the best part of the meal and yet the salad was lacking. Sorry to say but we won't be back"}
{"text":"We read lots of reviews on Pomo Pizzeria and finally decided to go to this one instead of in Phoenix and we loved it! We order the Don Alfonso pizza and it was great, and the olive oil added a nice touch! I would've given it a five, but unfortunately we had a very odd waiter. He was older with brown hair and wasn't helping us with picking a pizza, he would only drop one thing off and race away to do nothing but stand, and wasn't very polite. We will go back again but probably to the downtown Phoenix site."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited for lunch and it was amazing! The food was fresh, servings were huge and everything was fantastic. I have nothing negative to say.  We did go when it was super slow so I have no idea how it would be on a weekend when gilbert is super busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been in search of great Napoleon pizza ever since moving back to the Phoenix area. This did the trick! A very cute spot in downtown Gilbert. Our server, Michael, was awesome and they have a great selection of wines for a small pizzeria. They don't take reservations for small parties but do allow you to call ahead and put your name on the waitlist."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night.  They were pretty busy but was seated quickly. Ordered the Don Alfonso and margarita pizza. Food comes out relatively quickly however there is no organization. While waiting for our pizzas I saw multiple tables get served the wrong pizzas. Our order was no different. Our pizzas went to another table. This usually wouldn't be a problem but the pizzas were left on the wrong table and then confusion ensued. The waiter came back and picked up the pizzas and served them directly to us. I'm pretty sure the health department has a code where food once served cannot be served again. Just unsanitary. Pizza was also mediocre and small.   Also I agree with one of the reviews below about the waiter being weird. He was smug borderline obnoxious. Just do your job. He was a tall skinny dirty blonde. To top it all off the waiter added a beer to our check that the table next to us ordered.   Overall not worth your time or money. There are plenty of better options in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Omg! Incredible pizza has come to downtown Gilbert! For those who love the wood fired pizza crust, this is the place to be! Attentive service, awesome ambiance, and to die for pizza! Turned out to be the perfect place to head on a Sunday afternoon when many of the other places had lines into the street waiting for brunch. This place on the other hand was calm and classy with an incredible selection of fun and upbeat music, the classics! I ordered an artichoke pizza with extra cheese and they certainly delivered! The prosecco on happy hour was delicious too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pasta dish here, I tried to veganize by asking for no cheese. It came out with cheese in it anyways. Did not like the pasta in general because it didn't taste thoroughly cooked, a little raw in the middle but mad props for their service. When I said I thought there might be cheese in my dish the manager came out and double checked with the kitchen for me. When it turned out there was cheese in the dish he sincerely apologized and had them remake the dish with no cheese and took the order off our bill for the trouble of having to wait for food while everyone else in our party had already finished eating. On the fence about coming back because there isn't much for me on the menu but their pizza looked amazing so might give a no cheese margharita a try (I think they had vegan pies on their menu). Blown away by the service and how I was treated. This is a place that definitely values their customers."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place and ended up on a Saturday night after enjoying the Happy Hour next door at Zinburger (which has a great HH BTW).  There was an hour wait but with beer in hand next door we did not sweat that at all.    The friendly hostess took my cell and I received text updates about our table which is very convenient.  Once seated we realized how tight the place is. They really don't have that much seating inside and it was 113 so no bueno on the outdoor action.    The wood fired oven is bad ass but kicks a lot of heat into the place.  We watched about four groups of people try and sit at the bar facing the oven and all left within 2min due to the extreme heat.  The restaurant in general was HOT.  It did not bother me too much but the people I was with were uncomfortable.    We ordered some pasta and pizza dishes and both were good but not great.  The pasta had a nice bite to it and was flavored very well.  The pizza looked awesome but I unfortunately found the crust to be spongy and soft not crispy and hard.  I had the Pomo pizza and the flavor was good with a crust more like an Indian nan bread than what we are used to eating.  There was a noticeable lack of salt and yeast flavor in the dough which I actually enjoyed but again, it needed to be crispy.    Prices weren't bad considering their ingredients and people have to get over the \"compare to Hungry Howies\" temptation when they look at restaurant prices.  You get good quality ingredients here and it shows.    Pomo likely deserves a four-star but sitting in 85 degree restaurant just seems like a unacceptable oversight.  They either need to jack up the capacity of their current HVAC or learn to back down some of that heat the ovens are throwing in to the room with vents."}
{"text":"Will NEVER go here again. Terrible food, high prices, horrible service. I've never written a review online before but am compelled to do so in order to save someone else the unfortunate experience of eating here. Save your money and aggravation--go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came on night #2 of this location being open.  I have been to a lot of opening weeks of restaurants and you never know what you're gonna get.  All I have to say is that is if they are this great on night #2, I can't wait to come back!  The best part of our experience was the bartenders, Nikki & Tyler.  They were FANTASTIC!  We ordered food and drinks and everything was amazing!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I came to downtown Gilbert in hopes for trying Joe's BBQ. However, the girlfriend-unit is a vegetarian. Yes, I know, why take a vegetarian to a BBQ joint? Well, to be honest she has a running pseudo challenge that she can \"find something anywhere.\" That was not really the case at Joes BBQ, so we came over to Pomo...  It was busy when we came to Pomo so we just hopped to the pizza bar and ate there. No sense in waiting.   We ordered a half margherita and half meat-ridden pizza. The pizza was good, but I was definitely still hungry afterwards. It was maybe a 10\" pie. It was fun to watch them cook the pizza.  The server was odd. Not sure how to describe him, but he was odd and something I've never really experienced in a server before.  Alcoholic beverages were good.  Overall, a bit pricey. I'd much rather go to Mod, Fired, etc over this place."}
{"text":"One of the best food experiences I have ever had! We had an hour wait, which we knew it would be with being so new in Gilbert. Once our table was ready, we waited for about 10-15 minutes without anyone coming up to us to get drinks. Without us complaining, the manager came up to us and apologized right away and told us he was going to take care of us. We ordered a pizza and kale Caesar salad. When our food came out, they also brought us their specialty pasta, Pasta del giorno, which was amazing!! The pizza was awesome too! We constantly had amazing service all evening. The manager came to check on us frequently. After we were stuffed, they offered to bring us dessert. They brought us Panna Cotta and Tiramisu. I probably would have never thought to order Panna Cotta had I been the one ordering dessert, but it was absolutely incredible. I will crave it until I go back. Tiramisu was one of the best I've had! We walked out with full bellies and big smiles. This place is a must go. Even when they are still working out the kinks of a new location, the service and food was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I have ever had! I had Margherita pizza and Creme Brûlée for dessert. Great service, delicious food, laid back atmosphere. This is my new favorite pizza place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, and this is coming from an Italian from Canada, who was there with an Italian from Naples.  Enjoyed the Arancini Siciliani appetizer and loved the \"Pomo\" pizza (roasted red onion, sausage, mozzarella, tomato sauce)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for their Monday through Wednesday special... $20 for a pizza and a bottle of wine.  It's the perfect place to meet up with friends for a quick meal, some laughs, and tasty drinks.  The staff is always friendly... and atmosphere is great... and the value can't be beat.   It's the best Napoletano style pizza that I've had locally. Try the Peppino pizza and the Montepulciano wine combo... or if you're in the mood for pasta, the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese is awesome!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because it was new and fell in love! Awesome pizza and really nice atmosphere! Not too expensive either. Our server was Alexa and she made the whole experience great!! Her and the pizza are why I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"POMO = Apple?! Yes! Super short story: Back in the days the tomato was introduced to the Italians from the New World and was then used throughout their cooking. And since tomatoes have seeds in it, it is considered a fruit. The tomato is a fruit variation of an apple, hence pomo!  Hopefully I have captured and given the word Pomo its origin. If not, you are more than welcome to correct the story! :)  Anyway, the wait was 45 minutes. Started at the bar area to order some drinks. The Peach Bellini is a good sweet bubbly! Misters and the fan were on to help cool off in the summer heat. Within less than the suggested 45 minute wait we were seated to our table.   All the pizza prices were roughly around $16 or so for thin crust pizzas cooked in a wood fire oven. We went for the calamari appetizer with a few surprises of fried shrimp, a couple lemon wedges to squirt some acidity over the breaded seafood.   Pizzas: Pomo - Italian sausage, roasted red bell peppers, sautéed onions and mushrooms over the pomodoro sauce and cheese. The crust was a bit on the chewy dry side. $15.95  Donna Rosa - (no tomato sauce pizza). Thin crust, with pesto sauce, cherry tomatoes and shrimp. A bit on the very salty side but overall was my favorite pizza. Pizza crust was more edible here.   Calabessas - (I think that's what it was called). Thin crust as well, with tomato sauce, fried eggplant and shaved parmegiano cheese (which I loved). What I didn't like was the literal 4 teeny tiny pieces of eggplant about 0.34 cubic cm!!! What the heck happened here? A shortage of eggplant stock at the restaurant??? Not cool.   Beverages:  Pomo Lemon Drop - pomo juice (some pomegranate juice), vodka citrus, lemon juice. A bit strong and sour. $9 Peach Bellini - peach juice and champagne $8   I would have to say that the intentions of the pizza menu was there but the ingredients were not.  With a little more care into the pizzas this place would be great. Good ambience."}
{"text":"If you are reading this, Alex is actively doing a fantastic job as our bartender. Great indoor/outdoor setup with pretty decent beer selection. Come on by for a cold one...great atmosphere and good people."}
{"text":"First time here.  Best food, service, atmosphere we've ever experienced.  Higly recommended!"}
{"text":"Is this real life? This is one of the best italian places that I have ever eaten. Fresh handmade pasta, delicious drinks, and friendly staff. The reason for the only 4 stars is the wait. We had to come on a very business Friday Night."}
{"text":"I hate to leave bad reviews, especially for places I typically enjoy going (I haven't been to this location before, but I have enjoyed my food & dining experience altogether at both the a Downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale locations many, many times).   Last night I was craving good pizza and was excited to see that there was a Pomo nearby... I love Pomo! So I called and ordered a pizza, gnocchi, the Fritto Misto and a dessert. Let me start off with service... It was great.... They were friendly over the phone and when I arrived to pick up my order... They even called when it was ready (which was at 4:05, exactly 20 minutes after I had ordered it... Which was when they said it would be ready). I was in a bit of slow traffic (people weren't going the speed limit for whatever reason) but arrived less than 10 minutes later to pick it up - I know this because I got a call as walked out of the restaurant after waiting for about 5 minutes for the order and that call was at 4:15.   After getting in the car, we noticed that the pizza was COLD. The box was not warm at all.... Got home (again, about 10 minutes after picking it up) and had to not only reheat the pizza in the oven, but also had to put the gnocchi in a pan to warm it up on the stove). Also, it could be because we waited an hour or so to eat the tiramisu (it was in the fridge), but it was pretty disappointing, as well... The only way I can describe it was \"soggy\" and I wish I would have taken a picture because it didn't look as presentable as usual and not too appetizing.   It was really disappointing considering the facts that I've had such great experiences at the other Pomo locations and there are so many good reviews for this location--which makes me think that this could have been a one time thing--however I am not sure that I will want to come back to this location to see. If I had not ever had Pomo before, I definitely wouldn't return to any location based off of this experience.   It was $62 for this meal... Which was expected but the fact that we had to rewarm it all up, we might as well have gone to Safeway and bought gnocchi and a frozen pizza for $15 and had it."}
{"text":"I love Pomo. Like to the point that my friends make fun of me. Being from the east coast, I LOVE Italian food, but I'm sorry it's just hard to find decent quality out here. I found it at Pomo. Sure, it can get pricey, but I have no problem paying more for great food. Service is GREAT, the bartenders were quick to remember my name and have never steered me wrong."}
{"text":"We happened into Pomo last night on a whim. Our original selection had too long of a wait, so we walked up the street to see what else was available.   They have a nice patio area that is wide open into the restaurant, so we could see how attractive and appealing the inside is, too, so we decided to give it a try. While there was a nice crowd of people, we were able to be seated immediately. Perfect!  I ordered the margherita pizza. So delicious; I'm already craving more. I also had the peach iced tea. When a restaurant serves great iced tea, that's a huge bonus for me. The peach tea hit the spot!.  My dad had the lasagna. It looked cooked to perfection. He enjoyed every last bite. My mother enjoyed her mango salad as well.  We were all very happy that the other place didn't work out, as this was so much better. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the burgeoning restaurant scene in Gilbert. Excellent service and delicious food. We got the meatball app, a salad, pizza and a bottle of wine...everything was fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Review of my last visit!!! Wife and I just got back from dinner here. OMG!! Total difference in service. I believe her name was Kristine, super friendly, super attentive. Truly amazing turnaround. It was more busy than the last time we came here, and service was awesome!!! Food was great as well!!! Thanks Pomo's for reaching out to us. It took us a while to get back, but your service tonight changed our minds. To paraphrase Harry Dunne,\"Just when I thought you couldn't get any worse, you totally redeemed yourself!\" Well done Pomo!!!  Food was good, service was poor!!! My wife and I came to downtown to check out some of the newer restaurants. We've been to Liberty, Zinburger, and a few others already. We both thought, \"Hey, let's try this place, looks nice.\" We walk in, and get seated right away, outside, because the weather is perfect. This place isn't busy. There are open tables inside, and outside wasn't even close to half full. Normally we would expect someone to come over, bring some water, and greet us. Nope. 10 minutes later...nope. 15 minutes in, my wife gives me the \"look\". We have seen a few employees walk right past us while waiting 15 minutes for someone to just see if we needed help. Finally, someone did. We asked for water, plus I got a peach iced tea, while my wife ordered a glass of wine. Another 10 minutes roll by before our waiter come back, asks if we have any questions, then walks off. Wow. Finally comes back and asks if we are ready to order, which we did. Two pizzas. The pizzas come out within 10 minutes. Food was great, pizza was moist, and very flavorful. While eating the waiting visited us once. 20 minutes or so, he notices we are finished, and asks if we would like a box. We did, he said he would be back with the check. 10 minutes, nothing. 15 minutes, WOW, he made it back. He started to walk towards us, then stopped, turned around and printed up our check. We paid up, still tipped, and left. I just have to say, even with the pizza being as good as it was, we will NEVER go back here. Too many other choices around.  Ok, so management reached out to me, gonna give them another try. I'll amend the review if it changes."}
{"text":"I came back for a second try and I was impressed.  If no one has been to Pomo one thing I learned is explain what you want as the menu is a bit difficult for me to navigate and the staff will help you.  Alex did a tremendous job in explaining and my girlfriend and I had great appetizers (CARPACCIO DI BRESAOLA - the thinly sliced beef reminded us of Vietnam as that's how they slice their beef as well & PASTA & FAGIOLI).  Our pasta main meals (STROZZAPRETI ALLA SALSICCIA & LASAGNE AL FORNO) were rich and savory as Italian food should be and left us more than full with no room for desert. I did notice an addition of Merlot/Sauvignon wine on the menu... thank you from a Merlot lover, that was appreciated!  The atmosphere was relaxing and not that busy for a Sunday night which I love.  I work open to close six days a week so it is nice to unwind like this. Thank you to Cricket, Alex and Kaitlyn for taking care of us last night.  I would have made it in sooner but as a business owner I am on overdrive all the time.  With a second visit I am impressed enough to raise the rating to five stars! Sincerely, Jim Dale"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, and food.  Calzone was the perfect size and great local ingredients, pizza was likewise.   Definitely would recommend Pomo, different than he experience you'll get at oreganos, mellow mushroom, or the other local pizza joints."}
{"text":"Excellent location nd food. Great service. Worth multiple visits.  We had veggie pizza, gnocchi. Both were grt."}
{"text":"Overall I was underwhelmed by this place. Even with a reservation, we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, and they asked to take our order before we even sat, so it felt rushed from the get-go.   (*its pretty small so call ahead to get your name on the list so you can hopefully avoid waiting longer than you have to... I think there is an online waitlist somewhere...*)  Food was pretty good though. I had the chef pizza (white pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms) which was fun. I wish I had gotten to try more of my friends' food, but for once in my life I stuck to my own plate. It was also on the pricey side for pizza. I totaled almost $20 for just the pizza and a water.   We didn't have dessert but it looked really pretty from what I saw walking by.   But after all is said and done, I probably won't be back anytime soon, with all the other places in downtown Gilbert left to try."}
{"text":"Omg where to start!?  Food EXCELLENT.  Service EXCELLENT.  Overall experience EXCELLENT.  Seriously this place is amazing and I'm a little upset I've lived in Gilbert for over a year and we haven't came here.  Abby was our server and she was amazing, so helpful and her energy is contagious!!!  My husband and I tried her two recommendations and they were both phenomenal.  We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"pizza and drinks....i feel like I don't need to say anything else......but I will. Crawled into this joint after a night of getting a lil bit (very) sauced. Everyone there is super cool and their grub is money. I have only had their pizzas because i am an adult, a doucher and a complete hunk of a guy. I am sure their other grub is very sexual too but after 36 ice coldies, pizza is life. Get there and chill hard."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza in Phoenix and surprising ly very delicious pasta I have eaten Service is great, ambience is very good"}
{"text":"Gilbert has it going on! Props to this town for creating vibe and cool factor in the far suburbs of Phoenix. Pomo is a nice add to the scene. Great energetic atmosphere with lots of outdoor seating and a bar. Wish they would not have had the TV turned on...always downgrades a place.  On to the food: Pomo has a nice selection of appetizers and tasty thin crust wood-fired pizza. We had the capricciosa (olives, artichoke, mushrooms & ham). The crust was good and the topping ingredients were average. We thought it was probably due to the crowd. Why spend the money on super-premium ingredients if the price won't resonate with most of the patrons? Tip: ask for the chili oil to add some needed punch. Overall, decent pizza but go for the vibe.   Oh, the wine is worth mentioning...both the super Tuscan and chianti reserva were excellent! Have a glass for sure."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, friendly staff, lovely ambiance.  The pizza was delicious, perhaps the best I've ever had, also had the gnocchi which was great.  The friendly staff was a breath of fresh air after just having been treated rudely at Barrio Queen.  Training your front of the house staff goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Great place. Its crazy how this place is sometimes empty and oregano's is packed. Stupid Gilbert.   Came in and got some cocktails and then pizza/wine combo. Everything was great. Service, food, and atmosphere.   Just a solid choice"}
{"text":"I've been to the Pomo downtown and it was a fantastic experience.  Sadly, it wasn't the case with the Gilbert location.    We were there Friday afternoon and it was HOT in there.  I get that the cutsey thing in downtown Gilbert is to have those garage door roll-ups but folks, when it's 90 degrees, stop it.  Pull those suckers down and the turn up the AC.  (I felt really bad for the guys in the kitchen - they looked miserable.)    My margherita pizza had a total of four soggy basil leaves on it.  Four.    Husband's lasagna was microwaved and not even well - it was cold in the middle.    Our sever came by and asked how things were.  Husband said \"Okay but my food is cold in the middle.\"  Server said \"Great!\" and walked off.  (And I should note, this is common EVERYWHERE.  It's a rare experience when a server or staff member stops long enough to hear the answer to that question.)    Disappointing all the way around."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, we sat on the patio! I really enjoyed the atmosphere and delicious food! We ordered the calzone, the white pizza, and we tried most of the desserts! I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"We are Pomo fans from McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale but I wasn't too impressed with the Gilbert location food or service. I LOVED the hostess who not only put in our name but saved our reservation as we were driving over and it took 5 minutes longer than planned. I always order the gnocchi and it was eh. The mozz at the bottom wasn't melted, and the gnocchi was chewy."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on a Monday.  We sat at the bar and had great service.  Bartender was really personable and attentive.  Pizza is amazing!  Light and fresh!  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great service, however food is not good.   We started off with the caprese. This was literally 3 slices of tomato and 3 slices of cheese on a plate with 3 leaves of basil As garnish. No seasoning! It was so bland and was somethings I could have made at home in less than a minute. $9.00  Next we had the pollo salad. This was spring mix, tomatoes and olives only. Tossed in a lemon oil dressing. Again was so bland and had no taste! The chicken was warm as was seasoned food though $14.00  Then our pizza and pasta came. We had the Quattro pizza. The sausage was good but there wasn't very many pieces but the crust aS good cause it was thin. Pasta was horrible, I compared it to canned ravioli and my husband described it as hamburger helper! PizZa $16.00 and pasta was $15.00  This place is over priced and just tasteless. The menu only consist of appetizers, 4 salads, 2 soups, 4 pastas and pizzas to choose from!   Again service was great but that is all this place has going for it!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with our family of four.  Arrived before 5:30 and sat right down.  Place filled up shortly after so time it right unless you don't mind waiting a bit.  We have been to the location in Phoenix a few times and this was our second time here.  The pizza was very good (diavola) and we tried the meatballs as well.  The meatballs are extremely expensive for what they are.  You get two medium/large sized meatballs (about 3\" in diameter) for almost $10.00!  The texture was perfect, but I was looking for a lot more flavor.  Going to skip those in the future.  The service was lackluster.  We were greeted by our waiter who was very animated and engaging.  We thought it was going to be fun (which is when I start tipping very well)!  We were wrong.  Our beer order took almost 10 minutes to get filled and we were sitting next to the bar!  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was hot.  After the waiter dropped off the food he never checked back.  We wanted to order some bread to dip during our dinner but were never given the opportunity.  We ate everything at the table and had completely empty plates sitting for almost 10 minutes with no contact at all.  I noticed other employees walking by our table and looking at it.  Still nothing!  When the waiter finally showed up, he asked my youngest son if he was done eating.  His plate was empty.  All our plates were empty! Furthermore, when the waiter did anything for us he would try to answer in Italian, which is fine, except the first time he answered in Spanish (perfecto) and the next time he responded with the word \"super\" in an exaggerated French accent.  That, paired with the crappy service, felt patronizing.  It was more like he was joking around than serving customers.  Not genuine at all.  Go to the Phoenix location.  The feeling is much different."}
{"text":"We visited Pomo for the first time yesterday.  Got there for an early dinner.  It was not very busy when we arrived and lots of open seating.  We were greeted right away and seated.  Our server came over and took our drink order.  I noticed we were within their happy hour, but then we found out you only got happy hour prices if you sit at the bar.  We were sitting so close to the bar we could reach out and touch it, but no happy hour prices...this is silly.  It would of been nice if our greeter had mentioned this before she seated us.  I like good microbrews, but $7 is a bit high for an IPA.  We went on to looking at the menu and found a couple of pizzas that looked good.  We asked our server about doing a half/half and were told that they \"do not do that\".  Once again, this seemed a bit silly too.  Most pizza places will do this especially if it is the same base sauce.  Either way we decided to do the Principe, which was very good.  Fresh ingredients and definitely high quality that we definitely enjoyed.  Based on the excellent food I'm giving it 3 starts, but I think they could use to rethink some of the other things about the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I've always been satisfied. We've gotten great service and my favorite is the pizza. It's a casual place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I think this is the best pizza I have ever had so far! Thin and flavorful..yummy! Had Tiramisu for dessert and it was delicious.  I took my leftovers home and my boys loved it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Great atomophere and the food ... the food!  I say the best pizza in Arizona by far!"}
{"text":"The waiter wouldn't allow me to order a drink b/c my identification has expired although he acknowledged my age. Then our seating was way to close to the tables next to us. Then we placed our order and shortly a waiter came back with out pizzas and as we were about to eat them, another waitress came out and told us that they were actually to the table next to us (we had the exact same order). I told her she can take them but I already touched them. She left them and another guy came back and informed us if we took a bite, we would have to pay for pizzas as well as the ones on the oven. I told them to take them and they just threw it away. Terrible and the pizza is not anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Here we go!!!! Another great Italian real pizzeria in Arizona !!!! Great food good service.... Nice location"}
{"text":"Arincini or rice balls were excellent as an appetizer.  We also ordered the capriciossa pizza which has ham, artichokes and mushrooms which is surprisingly awesome and the Vesuvius calzone (deep fried). This place has excellent pizza with fresh ingredients.  Nice beer selection and wine list by the glass was long.  We had good service"}
{"text":"I LOVE pizza and I think I was the most excited person in town when I heard Pomo was coming. That being said - not a fan. The food is expensive and just meh. The drinks are realllly expensive and the atmosphere is nothing exciting. A pizza and two beers over $30? No thanks. And the pizza wasn't even that good. (It wasn't bad because....is there such a thing?) I've had other wood fired pizzas that were much better. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm originally from NJ, Italian all the way & have VERY high expectations regarding \"good\" Italian food. My husband & I met friends for dinner at Pomo. I was skeptical but the food not only met but exceeded & happily surprised my tastebuds!!! I took a bite of the meatball appetizer & was instantly transported back to being seven years old in my grandmother's kitchen; it tasted just like hers!! I ordered the Vesuvio calzone & my palate was delighted with the brightness of fresh basil combined with the creamy ricotta & savory mushrooms surrounded by a tasty, gently crisped dough. My husband had the lasagna which was exceptional as well!! Even the cafe latte was delicious (my hubby ordered 2!) and we finished our meal with a creamy, fresh pana cotta that was both light & refreshing!! We will ABSOLUTELY be returning & look forward to trying more of the items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Went in around 5 on a Saturday. Read the other reviews so had high hopes, and it was very disappointing. The hostess said we could sit outside or at the bar, didn't even offer a normal table. We decided for the bar since we didn't want to deal with the heat. We were given menus, then fell into the black hole of crap service. Sat there for about 10 minutes. I was watching my phone and they had about 30 seconds before we got up and left when the manager cam over and asked if anyone has helped us. We said no, he apologized, and offered to comp our drinks which was nice, and the only reason we stayed. So we finally got someone to come serve us, and after that the pizza came out quickly. The pizza was good, but not amazing. I've had pizza this style at about 6-7 other places, and they were all better. With that said, it was still good, just not great. The price was a bit high. Other pizza places this style are typically $10-13 a pizza while here hey were $13-17. My wife got one pizza and I got one, bill came out to $34. That was with the drinks comp'd. Once we finished our food, we waited another 10 minutes or so for the waitress to notice and bring our bill.   There are just better choices. I wish we went next door to Zinburger because it would have been a better meal. Or Libery Market, Joes, Postinos, or one of the many other places in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Pomo is a moderately upscale restaurant. The quality of the ingredients is high and service is professional (vs friendly). We enjoy sitting by the oven to watch them prepare and cook the pizzas.   Their food is more of a true Italian food/pizza and not in any way an \"American\" Italian/pizza joint. If that's what you're looking for, this is not the place for you.   When we are in the mood for more authentic, this is our go to Italian restaurant. Personally, I enjoy their eggplant Parmesan. It's not a large dish filled with noodles,thankfully, but the flavor and quality is very good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! My husband & I split pizza & lasagna. The pizza was very yummy, and the lasagna was the best we have ever tasted! Our child has severe food allergies, and next time we go they will make her a dairy free gluten free pizza as they carry her dairy free cheese! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"You know, I have to admit, I am not sure I am trusting Yelp anymore. It seems to me that there are some people posting here as a marketing ploy to falsely boost reviews. After reading the reviews here and seeing the spot on 3TV news, we were excited to give it a try. The service was exceptional, wine list was good, but the food..... OK at best. Not good. Not great. Just OK. We had the meatball appetizer that was the best part of the meal. Very tasty. Then a Pomo pizza. We liked the crust.... we were expecting a near Bianco quality pizza. Unfortunately not the case. Then we had the pasta dish with bolognese and peas. Again, it was ok, not good, not great.  We decided it would be good for future wine and appetizers."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza! It's also a great location in downtown Gilbert, however that means that parking stinks and it's always crowded. I came in with three friends and we were sat right at the counter in front of the giant pizza oven-a cool thing to see, and a great distraction from the fact that it's almost impossible to see your entire party at once! Also, sitting here also meant we had to either turn around to see our waitress, or just talk over our shoulders at her..... Overall great food but disappointed in the experience."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. The whole experience was amazing.  Last week I was craving pizza. Naturally, I drag my boyfriend out to go find a place. We drove by having no idea Pomo was 15 minutes from close (which we didn't even find out until we were half way done eating). The staff never complained or even told us they were closing like most of the time when u go somewhere to eat and the staff is tryin to leave. Anyway besides the point...  We walked in and the host was super friendly and sweet. She made sure we were comfortable when she sat us and told us our server would be over. On the way to the table we were said hello to by a server (who ended up being our server) and a man behind the bar with a really cool accent. It was very welcoming.   Our server, Michael, came over to our table and much to my delight was super knowledgeable about all beers they had. (Which made my boyfriend much happier about being dragged out-which made me way happier that he wasn't cranky about me dragging him out at 9:45 at night lol)   The man with the fancy accent (I think he was the manager) was walking by and asked how we were doing. We'd never been there before so I asked a couple questions about the menu while our server was getting our drinks. I'm pretty picky and I told him what I liked & what I didn't like and he came up with a great suggestion.  The pizza we got was delicious. It came out in a timely manner. Michael had came back to make sure everything was tasting good and we that we were pleased. I waived the manager over to thank him and asked about some cocktails be I wanted one. Also told him what I liked and didn't like and he whipped me up a delicious cocktail. Both our server and the manager along with the rest of the staff was outstanding.   My boyfriend and I definitely will be returning and probably make this a regular spot.  The atmosphere is fancy, well kept and very clean. The food and drinks were perfect.  But we will definitely be coming back mostly due to the staff.   10 stars!!"}
{"text":"We have been looking forward to this location opening for quite some time. We had eaten at the Downtown Phoenix location and it was delicious. It probably wasn't a good idea to eat here on their first Friday after opening though. When I called in I was told it would be about an hour and twenty minutes for our party of 8. When we showed up 1:15 into the wait we were told it would be another 67 minutes. After a conversation with an understanding and appreciative Manager we were seated in about 10 minutes. I'm a happy camper. The food was delicious!  Their meatballs are fantastic as is the Calamari and Shrimp appetizer. The Pizza though, that will keep you coming back. Enjoy but beware of crowds."}
{"text":"I came in after waiting 2 hours to get a cold breakfast at Liberty Market. They took me an hour before they actually opened the food and service are excellent. Christine provided a world-class level of service! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in downtown Gilbert. The pizza dough is the best I've ever had! My daughter and I love the margarita pizza. All of their ingredients are flown in fresh from Italy. Not only is there food fantastic but their wait staff is so pleasant and super friendly every time we come! Great salads and desserts. I give this restaurant five stars!"}

{"text":"Went on a Saturday night about 6:30. We were seated right away thanks to call ahead seating.  Hostess was very nice and brought waters to the table before server could.  That should have been our sign.... things started out great but as soon as we placed our food order we never saw our server. After all 4 of us ran out of drinks we flagged down another server, he said he would assist but then \"forgot\". Eventually, I made my way up to the bar to get drinks so we could try to enjoy our food.  The bartender was great and assisted immediately, but even after that still no sign of our server! When he finally showed at the end of the meal we asked for our checks and to go boxes.  We received one box and no check.  We flagged him down again and finally got our check- only to see that he had split our bill incorrectly.  Rather then wait another 20 minutes- we decided to pay as is and settled up amongst ourselves.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in some time, you would think the restaurant would want to turn over the tables quicker and with more efficient service.  I hope our server is the exception to the rule there- if not I don't see this place lasting long in Gilbert."}
{"text":"KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF!   In the two plus years I have been in AZ, this is the first time I have said this. When you walk in you see this beautiful gold sparkly Italian pizza oven.  The place is very small, only a few tables inside and a few tables outside.  There is a good size bar to sit and  sitting area around the oven you can eat and watch them make the pizzas. The staff is externally well trained and knowledgeable and can pronounce everything on the menu, which is good because I could not.  We started with the mini meatballs. To Die For!  it's the sauce, all about the sauce, and those meatballs are so good.  Do not know why they do not offer spaghetti and meatballs.  Next we ordered the Bufala Verace and the Don Alfonso pizza, again To Die For!!! And we had to get desert, we never do that.  I cannot tell you what it is called but it is a sort of jello, custard,  pudding thing, drizzled with caramel and a strawberry and blackberry.  To Die For!!!!  There is no way of describing the taste, you have to try it yourself. Glad we went when we did because soon it will be a hour wait.  But still worth it."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant.  The Don Alfonso pizza was great and we had 2 of their desserts which were quite good.  We sat out on the patio and the atmosphere was quite nice.  Great addition to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"It's expensive with small portions. The waitress was rude and the food came out at three different times. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I dont even want to give this place one star! So I live down the street from downtown gilbert but I can never seem to enjoy downtown since  everything has long waits just to get seated not to mention getting food well I been wanting to try this place out so imagine my excitement on a thursday night when I walked by and there was no line (well that should of been my first clue) as every where else had long wait times) so here I am excited and starving we get seated quickly by a bored looking hostess, ok no problem I just want to try the food -look over our menus and get excited about our choices of we are going to eat and no server comes by not even water brought over..... still waiting as we watch the servers and bartender chit chat at the bar by the hostess station not a care in the world -one server walks by to another table that was seated after we were seated and I say \"excuse me sir\" 3xs.... yep ignored!!! another table seated yep they get their water we are still waiting ...by this time I am checking my armpits yep I am clean just gotten out of the shower and dressed decently ...so what is the problem....oh must be the downtown gilbert thing   (shitty service at most places down here) I am out of here get up to leave with my party and not ONE single staff member said a thing. I tried to say something to the hostess and she just stared at me like I was an idiot then I walked out while my partner tried to talk to someone in charged who just looked at him blankly. Sorry Pomo I will not bother to try your food ever and I will continue to tell people looking for a place to eat in downtown to go wait somewhere else becasue apparently POMO staff is inot interested in doing their jobs!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was amazing! Our waitress Holly gave us exceptional service and was very friendly. The food was outstanding. Potatoe Gnocchi was to die for!! We will definitely be coming back here!! Thank you Holly!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the portions were small and overpriced. Two meatballs on an appetizer for 10 bucks? The margarita pizza was missing basil on half the pieces. Not sure we will be back even though food was good."}
{"text":"SUNDAY FUNDAY. We have friends that rave about Pomo, let's check it out.  Sunday afternoon.....dead. We were 2 of maybe 10 people in there. Good beer selection on tap, and I ordered meatball appetizer right away. Wait, $10 for 2 meatballs?.......that sucks. Couldn't bring myself to order a 12 inch pizza that would cost me $17.  Not a fan. Too pricey for us."}
{"text":"The pasta and pizza dishes are very good. Our waitress was awesome. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place was okay.....     the server we had was very polite and helpful!!     We thought the prices were a little high for the quality and amount of food.    But I guess that's in par with the downtown Gilbert row.     My daughters margarita pizza was good.   She liked it.     My husbands pasta was a 6 he said.    Had okay flavor but nothing that rocked his socks off.      I ordered the burratta and tomato appetizer as my meal.    The green and red tomatoes were hard to bite into.     But my main problem was the taste of the cheese in the center.     It was just gross.    It had a funny after taste to it I couldn't put my finger on but was a little leary of taking another bite for fear of getting sick.    It was a strong taste and not in a good way.     Not what I could finish..... and I was starving.     So reluctantly I had to let my server know and he took it and swapped it for a cheese pizza.       The overall atmosphere in the restaurant was pretty good.     I liked that you could watch the chef make pizzas as you dined.      Not sure I'll go back as there are several other options to try nearby."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple. Our server was absolutely terrible and the food was over priced. We spent some time walking around the row and I had been carrying a drink with me. I brought the drink in (nearly finished) and our server (instead of greeting us) asks me to remove the drink. Our check was silently dropped at our table. The food was decent so this place gets one more star than it should. $15-16 is overpriced for what you get.  There are PLENTY of better offerings in this area. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the place to get pizza that is as close to real Italian as it gets. The meatballs were awesome too. They treated us like family and the waitress talked with my wife, who has breast cancer, like they were sisters. She really made my wife feel special. A place we will gladly visit again!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has so many good reviews... Went here with my family. The menu looked lack luster and overpriced. We decided to get just a couple pizzas to share because everything else seemed so unappealing. They are definitely no where near as good as people are claiming on here... They have special pizza ovens that create a soggy middle and crisp sides and I find that kind of gross. I like my pizza crust crispy. The crust itself was bland. The sauce was watery and not flavorful. There was barely any cheese and the cheese had no flavor. The only decent part of the pizza was the salami on it. And let's be honest- is salami ever not tasty? The service super sucked. The waitress barely came back even though the resteraunt was dead. And she would take off right away before we could even ask any questions. She never refilled our drinks. So if you like paying a lot of money for small portions and mediocre pizza and crappy service than POMO is for you. If you actually want good pizza then I would probably skip this place."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday the 11th of March. The spot itself is cool and lively with a nice patio and small inside area.   The server took about 15 minutes to come to our table, not a huge deal but it was unusual. Our server was Scotty, he was friendly and sarcastic and probably the best part about this experience.  We ordered the Caprese salad, Gnocchi and a Pomo pizza. The salad had a really bad mozzarella to tomato ratio, the mozzarella was triple the size of the tomato. The salad was kind of rough. The Pomo pizza was doughy and watery, I don't know how this consistency was achieved but it wasn't that good. The gnocchi on the other hand was perfect, it was seriously some of the best gnocchi I've had in Arizona.   Overall this place doesn't deserve two stars because the vibe is nice and there are redeemable qualities."}
{"text":"Saturday night, open seats at the bar so we ordered some drinks as we waited for a reservation next door. Red sangria was far below average, watered down and plain bland, boyfriend loved the beers they had on tap.  Two bartenders were in back & fourth banter the whole time, unprofessional.  Would like to go back to eat, although their menu stated that their pizzas may seem undercooked&wet, which didn't sound appetizing."}
{"text":"The restaurant has great ambience and a beautiful pizza oven.  The hostess stand was a swarm of 3 team members - none of them friendly or helpful.  Our server was attentive and gave good menu advice.  We ordered  an eggplant pizza and their most popular pasta to share.  The pasta was well-prepared.  The pizza was good but had ZERO eggplant on it.    Our food was delivered  less than 5 minutes after we placed our order. Seemed a bit fast for a sit down restaurant.    Don't know why our server didn't bring bread to our table as we saw brought each to of the surrounding tables."}
{"text":"The food was worth the wait! This is a small joint and they struggled with seating a party of 5.  We arrived before 5 pm on a Saturday night in order to avoid the wait but still waited over 45 minutes.    However, we had great service and a delicious meal once we were seated.  The bruschetta trio was amazing and we loved the 2 pizza choices that were recommend by our server Jessica.  Don't miss the cannoli.    Great addition to downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten free pizza and after I finished it I commented to the waiter how great their gluten free pizza was. He said oh, that wasn't gluten free.  He said he was sorry.  I expected they might take something off the bill but they did not. I haven't eaten bread in like 4 years. Thanks pomo for breaking my streak! Next time I'll repeat it to the waiter 4 times and make sure they repeat it back to me."}
{"text":"We were there the 2nd night they were open. Lots of staff, all very courteous and knowledgeable! Food was good. Had the Don Alfonso pizza. Really good flavors, but would have liked a tad more meat. Meatballs came out a little cold, so they rushed them right back and got us new ones. Had to wait a couple awhile as they were quality checking, but we didn't mind as I thought that was a good sign they weren't nuking them! Not only were they delicious, but they comp'd them since we had to send them back.  Sculpin on tap, which the hubby is a fan of and really good, authentic drinks. It's a little crowded inside for my liking, but there was a ton of staff on hand and our table was right by the bar, so I imagine it'll feel less cramped when they don't have all hands on deck. All in all, fantastic pizza, good drinks and another gem in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Really poor service. We had a party of six. They brought all the pastas out first then it took another 10 minutes for the pizzas & calzone. By then the pastas were cold. The calzone was only filled on half of the side!!!! The other side had nothing but cheese!!! We told our server & she said she would let the kitchen know. We ordered drinks & they didn't even come till AFTER we paid our bill!!!! The server did offer a free dessert because of the calzone, but that was after we paid oh bill & told the kids we were going for ice cream next door. They should have taken the calzone off the bill!! We won't go back. Way too many good pizza places around!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, beautiful restaurant. Wonderful waitress very attentive even as she had other tables she never made us feel like she wasn't looking out for us. The food was spectacular. 5 stars even the olives! Whole kalamata olives so rich with flavor!  I'm very glad we spent our money here and will most likely be there again soon."}
{"text":"Had a part of two on a Friday night. We expected a wait but were seated immediately! I had a tasty cocktail made of tomatoes and watermelon- sounds weird tastes delicious. Server was friendly and knowledgeable. Delicious vegan pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great cocktails! Always hits the spot. The meat and cheese plate they have is a favorite and I haven't tried a cocktail I haven't liked."}
{"text":"I love Pomo the food & the service is amazing! We come down here a couple times a month and love to people watch in downtown gilbert."}
{"text":"My husband, niece and I went here for an early dinner. We were seated promptly. No wait. Our server was nice, helpful and friendly. The pizza really wasn't my style. The center portions are not cooked to done. I guess it's the type of pizza made in the region this style originates from. I did not enjoy it. The flavors were good, but the texture of \"undone\" really threw me. That and the price for the amount of toppings. I ordered the mushroom pizza. The mushroom flavor was good, but they were sparse. Overall - unimpressed."}
{"text":"Yum! I have a gluten allergy and was looking for a great margarita pizza and I found it! It was AMAZING! My fiance also got his pizza on a GF crust so I could try it and he said he wouldn't have thought it was GF if I didn't tell him! So great!!! The atmosphere was so nice for a date night and the service was amazing! Especially on a Saturday night! So please will be going back!!"}
{"text":"We loved coming here while visiting our friends and watching them tie the knot! The waiter was very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions when the item we wanted wasn't available. The saffron rice balls are very good! The mushroom soup is amazing! The lasagna is super disappointing! The most expensive menu item on our tab was the worst tasting. My husband described it as very Chef Boyardee esq. I totally agreed! It tasted like someone opened the chef-boy-ardee can and plopped it on our plate. The noodles were paper thin and there was just nothing that impressed us with that dish. Other than that, we had a great experience and would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch here. We sampled 2 pastas and 3 pizzas. The calzone was excellent and the pasta with sausage was so good. We also shared 4 of the desserts. The Nutella torta was great. We will be going back. The spicy pasta was spicy though."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pomo (downtown Phoenix and now Gilbert) for a while, and I think they have some of the best Neapolitan pizza in the Valley. The Gilbert location is usually fairly busy, and I've experienced varying levels of service.   The last time I had issue with waiting 15-20 minutes when only half of the restaurant was full. Additionally, I had to ask (not our server) for a drink and then our pizzas came right after we received our meat/cheese board. It wasn't like they were very busy. They could've timed the serving of our food a little better.  I continue to go to Pomo regardless of the service because their pizzas are amazing.  UPDATE 6/22/18: The General Manager Alexander contacted me, apologized for the service, and personally invited me back. This is how you take care of your customers. Like I previously mentioned, there was no doubt I'd be back for their great food. It's just nice to know your concerns are being heard and addressed.   DEFINITELY CHECK OUT POMO IN GILBERT!"}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari, a pizza and a desert.  The calamari was good, although I thought the sauce could have been a bit more spicy, but my GF thought it was perfect.  So that was good.  The pizza was good as well; perfect crust. The problem came when we ordered desert, which was a lemon tort.  The first bite my GF took she was pulling hair-like fibers from it.  I cut another piece that came came off with hair-like fibers.  I didn't eat it and we sent it back.  The manager came out with our check immediately and told us he \"comped\" the   Tort (yeah well we didn't eat it so..). And that the hair like fibers were due to using strawberry purée in the tort.   Sorry, I don't buy it.  I don't care how you purée strawberries, you're not going to end up with 2\" fibers. So basically the excuse was lame and the response to it was also lame.  I'm not sure what those were all about but whatever if you are producing deserts that make people think their eating hair, you're doing it wrong.  When you try and blame the strawberries for it, your not making the situation any better."}
{"text":"Went to promo on a Saturday night with another couple for dinner. We had a little bit of a wait so we decided to get some drinks and an appetizer at the bar. The bar is very large and very comfortable.  The restaurant itself is fairly small and there is a decent size patio as well. The bartender on duty was very knowledgeable as well as friendly. We got four glasses of wine and a bruschetta plate and it was very good.  Shortly thereafter, we were called to our table.   Once seated, we were promptly greeted by a very friendly and upbeat server. She was also very knowledgeable about the menu and made some good suggestions. We decided to get two pasta dishes and two pizzas for the four of us to share. My husband and I decided on the tagliatelle with meat and peas and a margarita pizza. Both were absolutely delicious. Our friends enjoyed their selections as well. After our main entrees, we did opt for dessert although I probably shouldn't have because my hips felt it the next day. We had the creme brûlée and our friends had the cannolis and both were very good. A few more glasses of wine were also had as well. When we were finished, we walked away saying what a great night it was. Food, atmosphere and friends."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite spot.  You know happy wife happy life so we go here quite often.  Their pizza is amazing.  The crust and light and fluffy.  It is like a light pizza not heavy and wont overly fill you up.  The Toto Sapore pizza (Meat Pizza) is my favorite.  It has just the right amount of kick from the spicy salami.  The pasta I recommend is the Strozzapreti Salsiccia which is italian sausage, tomato sauce, cream, rosemary, parmigia.  The pasta is very creamy and good.  Last but not least get the meatballs which come with 2 meat balls.  The meat balls are super tender and juicy.  This is a must go to when you want a PIZZA NAPOLETANA.    BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"I've been to Pomo in Gilbert twice now. The first time was when this location had only been open for a couple weeks. Everything in the restaurant was shiny and brand new. While the food was good, nothing blew me away.   My second visit was about two weeks ago (...a month ago. I really need to start posting my reviews sooner). We stopped in around 9:20pm after getting out from a performance at Hale Theater. Given the time of night, there was no wait to be sat and only a few other couples still dining in the whole restaurant. (Plus, that day there had been a heavy rainy storm so business was probably slow in general).  Besides the delicious food, what sets Pomo apart from the rest was how we were treated. Even though it was near closing time (10 o'clock on Thursdays), we never once felt rushed by our server or any of the other staff. When asked how we would like the food to come out from the kitchen, we offered to have the pizza (which only takes seconds to cook) to be brought out with the rest of the meal, but our waitress paced out each dish perfectly as if it we had been dining earlier in the evening.   Here's what we enjoyed for dinner:   Starter: Pollo Chopped Salad - A mix of spring greens, feta, avocado, almonds, red onions and cherry tomato with a lemon dressing. Hooray! Finally a salad that isn't embarrassing to eat in public! The lettuce is super bite-size (hence chopped salad) making it easy breezy to eat without having to fight against large chunks of lettuce.   Entree: Pizza Chef - A base of light cream topped with mozzarella, prosciutto, and mushrooms. The crust had a nice char on the bottom and combined with the creaminess of the sauce and the cheese made for one truly tasty the pizza.    Dessert: Cannoli - The plate comes with 3 crispy shells filled with a sweet cream and each finished a different way: pistachio, chocolate, or cherry. It was hard to choose a favorite but if i had to pick, the chocolate one would be my top choice of the bunch.     I would like to point out we received not 1, not 2, but 3 -- 3 water refills! A-MAY-ZING! Also, there are a couple TVs above the bar area so we were able to watch and listen the news about the storm from earlier in the day.   With so many options in downtown Gilbert (even late on a rainy evening), I am really glad we decided to go to Pomo for our meal!"}
{"text":"So I am updating my review from before. The gm reached out to me and has done what he could to make up for the issues I had. I will definitely be giving this place a second chance in the near future!"}
{"text":"Food was really great and the overall atmosphere was nice.  Our server however was awful. He was more interested in the NBA game than serving us. We had to ask him to fill our waters and our appetizer and salad came out after our pizza. We ordered vodka sodas and it seemed as though there was very little vodka and they were $7 each. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! In fact, it was exfcellent. The wait staff could use some more training. On three separate occasions, our waiter seemed unprepared, slow, and confused."}
{"text":"The Peppino Pizza is probably some of the best pizza I have had in the Phoenix valley."}
{"text":"Excellent service and attention to customer needs!! Pizza was outstanding !!! Great job !!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my fiancé last night waiters name was chris b I believe. Our waiter was great, atmosphere was great, I got to even show a trick with opening a bottle of wine place is top notch"}
{"text":"Wow. Let me tell you about the AMAZING customer service I received from Stefano, and Cricket -- the two most incredible restaurant owners I have met.   After my last review, Stefano reached out to me to see if there was anything he could do to bring me back to Pomo one more time. I told him I would be willing to try once more if he could guarantee it would go well.   It went better than well.   First of all, try the bolognese. It's literally the best I've ever had and I'm Italian -- so that says a lot. He recommended it to us and I'm so grateful he did. We had an amazing waitstaff taking care of us, checking on us, and we were treated like royalty. Stefano recommended a pizza to us, which we also received, and we loved that as well.   We finished off the night with dessert, and Cricket recommended a sampler so we'd get to try a few things. The tiramisu, cannoli, semifreddo, and profiterole were all incredible.   Most of all, I walked away from last night feeling like Pomo just happened to have an off night the time before -- they really are a great restaurant with incredible food, and amazing people. I have absolute respect and admiration for Stefano, Cricket, and their staff. Our waitress, Lauren, was absolutely amazing as well. She was attentive, kind, and checked on us often. We were VERY impressed and will definitely be back -- and we'll bring friends!   Thank you Pomo -- you do customer service very right."}
{"text":"Anything Stefano touches is absolutely delicious.  This, like the other Pomo pizzerias, is the real deal with wonderful Napoletana pizzas and high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Gilbert locals and frequent the Heritage District often. We have been looking forward to the opening of this new restaurant for weeks. We went in Friday night and thought immediately it might not have been the best idea with the hour long wait. We decided to stick it out and went to the bar to sit down for a drink while we waited for our table. The bar was very full and we were fortunate to find two seats outside. This might have been or best decision of the night. The misting system was beautiful and dropped the temperature down by at least 20degrees.   We sat outside and everyone around us seemed to be really enjoying themselves. The bartenders name was Tyler and he was very enthusiastic and talkative with all the customers even while being very busy. Throughout the night he would engage and educate all of the customers outside about drinks and the food at once just for fun. He recommended a cocktail that had tomatoes in it. I was hesitant but it ended up being one of the best cocktails I have ever had. We were going to wait for a table but we were so impressed and entertained by the bartender that we decided to stay outside and enjoy the show with our meal.  My husband ordered the Don Alfonso pizza and I had the Pomo. Both were fantastic and definitely good enough reasons to come back. However, anytime that I return in the future, I will make sure to look for our new favorite bartender in the Heritage District before getting a table. This place is a must see!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and Pomo never disappoints! While their pizza is yummy, we LOVE their fresh pasta. Every pasta dish I've tried has been delicious. Had the meatballs last night and those were great as well. But leave room for dessert, their tiramisu is one of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Our server was super friendly, really great server but the pizza was average. Too expensive for a personal pizza that was good but not great. There were large parts of the pizza that didn't have cheese on it. I love NY style pizza like Grimaldis, but Pomo was just ok."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my hubby. It's a cute little simple restaurant. We walked in to a smell of fresh mint which was really nice and inviting. We were served right away. We ordered the Peppino pizza and it was so incredibly good. Their pizza's cook in 90 seconds inside their 900 degree wood  oven so we didn't have to wait more than 10 min for our food! They bring a bottle of spicy olive oil and the cheese and peppers to your table without asking, loved that. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Pomo's after a show at the theater down the street thinking we'd get a good Italian meal.  The place was quiet and we were seated a the 1st row of tables by the pizza oven on a 115 degree day.  Too hot for me and was quite surprised the hostess didn't ask if we'd be okay with a \"hot\" table.   Ordered an appetizer board which included a nice selection of different meats, bread, olives, marinated artichoke hearts, and a few slivers of Parmesan cheese.  All items were tasty and the presentation was appetizing.    We shared a salad and pizza.  The salad was a basic green salad; decent size and fine dressing.  Nothing spectacular.  We ordered the Pomo pizza and were greatly disappointed.  It was served on a white plate and there was a brown liquid under the crust; much more than just condensation.  Needless to say the crust was wet and gross.  The restaurant manager was shocked and apologetic; something like that has NEVER happened before.  But he wasn't shocked enough to offer a return coupon or discount.  Bad business practice.  If pizza is your primary food, it should be great each time. The highlight of the meal was Tiramisu.  It was moist (as it should be) and delicious with a light coffee flavor cake between layers of creamy goodness.    Won't be back and can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  While I understand this is a pizzeria and I didn't have pizza, I would still think an Italian establishment would have decent lasagna.  For $15.99, I received a 5 square inch helping of lasagna.  No bread, no side salad, nothing.  And, the lasagna was so salty that I could hardly finish my meal.  The service was great, but the food was not."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza place! Food tastes fresh and they give you a big portion size! I had the chicken salad and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we have been walking right by this eatery not knowing the quality fare that waited within.  Fortunately now we know, and we shall return to continue our exploration of the offerings."}
{"text":"The rating more for the pizza rather than the service. The waiters I've had here the couple times I have been haven't been attentive and don't listen to what your ordering and seem super fake. When you're ready for they check they just keep filling your water and don't ask if you need anything else. Super disappointing for such a nice establishment"}
{"text":"Before I start, I must admit I'm not a fan of pizza.  Came here with my adult son, who's a real pizza lover.  We ordered one that came folded over.  Different and delicious!  I noticed that many people around us ordered their own personal pizza and ate every bite. If this review were just based on pizza, I'd give it a 4.5.  But here's what brought the rating down.  I ordered a Caprese salad, which I do love.  It was fine, just small for the price.  The restaurant was one big room, with tables crammed close together.  The glass and metal decor made the area very noisy.  The TVs all around the room didn't help -- either with the noise or with the service.  Our server seemed to be more interested in watching one of the games rather than paying attention to his customers.  When I asked for a drink refill, I felt I was distracting him from what he wanted to be doing.   There are a lot of tasty pizza choices, all cooked in a brick oven.  Also a few pasta and panini choices, plus interesting non-alcoholic drinks.  The place was full with a line of people waiting for tables, so that's always a good sign of a restaurant's popularity."}
{"text":"This is definitely a solid pizza place. It's more refined than the traditional pizza joint, so it's good for foodies. They get pretty busy around peak dinner hours, so be prepared to wait or arrive early. The service was average...nothing bad, but nothing stellar either.  The meatball appetizer was quite good. A blend of beef and pork. They were moist and well seasoned. The size was definitely appropriate for one person.  I had the meat pizza, and it was excellent. The authentic wood fired crust had a perfect char and the meats were very high quality. You can clearly tell that they are not canned or pre-packaged like a lot of places.  The tiramisu was a great dessert. It was light and had the right amount of coffee/rum."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian.  The pizza chef is my favorite, with white sauce, garlic, prosciutto, mushrooms. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Ok, little disadisappointed the last time we went. Ordered the Arancini rice balls stuffed with meat & cheese. 1/2 teaspoon of the meat doesn't constitute a stuffed rice ball. The rice was a saffron rice which had so much saffron that it had a metallic taste to it. I had my husband try a bite just to check and he too agree, it had a metallic taste to it. I told the waiter who took the 2nd ball away and then brought it back boxed to go. I explained that I didn't like it and didn't want to take it home. He said they don't make them there so he'd let the manager know. Hmm, ok. Then I ordered the principe pizza which is my favorite as I order it every time. But this time, it just wasn't the same. It had what appeared to be all the toppings and yet still missing something. Had a slice and took the rest home thinking maybe because I had the metallic tasting rice ball it was making the pizza taste bad. Decided to have the rest for dinner and added a little olive oil to the top. Yep, that was it. They forgot the finishing olive oil. Made such a difference.  C'mon guys, get it together. I talked to someone else that is a regular there and even they said the last time they were there it wasn't up to the previous times. New cook? Please fix it, love the pizza and service here."}
{"text":"Had a meeting in Downtown Gilbert and needed to grab lunch and walked in to Pomo.  It was phenomenal, the meatballs were great and service was even better.  Great vibe and atmosphere.  If you go you MUST sit at bar and ask for Jenna.  If you are in area it is a must visit"}
{"text":"Amazing food, staff, and manager. Will be going back again and again. We had the Pomo Pizza, and the meat balls.. It was so good and the bartender Brian made the best drinks!!"}
{"text":"Maybe too authentic Italian style pizza - spartan sauce and toppings with a lot of crust. Our group tried three pizzas without any memorable results. Two different salads, however, might inspire a return visit. Patio is dog friendly. Gluten free crust comes with a menu disclaimer discouraging anyone from ordering it."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  My wife and I tried this new location on a Thursday night. The place was half empty and now I know why. It's mediocre at best. The menu is nice, and the wine list is OK. My guess is this is a medium grade pizza joint focused on families.  Kind of like Olive Garden. Well, if you want mediocre meals with mediocre service for a premium price, this is your place."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for a friends birthday party. Tried two different kinds with my wife. A few pieces were more done then I would like, but pretty good still. My wife doesn't really care for pizza and loved it. She was willing to come back and that is a huge thing. It is a little pricey, but very good."}
{"text":"Honesty, the pizza was lacking flavor. Would have rather eaten a pizza from Peter Piper Pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero, I would. $115 for food that tasted like Chef Boyardi- no way do I believe it was homemade. Seriously, 2 bowl of pastas, 1 gnocchi, & a salad & 2 orders of bruschetta was $115 before tip. The sauce tasted like a tin can. The bruschetta was burnt to charcoal. Absolutely awful. I have no idea how some said it was excellent. The best thing there was the crushed ice."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place!  Nice bar area, inside and out.  It was too cold for us to sit outside at the bar so we sat inside.  Great service from the bartender.  The BF and I shared the 4 cheese white pizza with added pesto and it was soooo good!  We also got these little fried dough strips off the HH menu, but I'd skip those next time.  Everything's a bit pricey, but it was so good I'm not complaining.  Looking forward to going back when the weather is nicer and sitting on the outside patio."}
{"text":"Went during lunch with my office and they were extremely accommodating! Food was AMAZING you have to try the calzone it is the best. We tried all of the desserts too. Food is a little higher priced but SO worth it."}
{"text":"Me and my friends visited Pomo for the first time Friday night.  It was my friends birthday and we were looking for somewhere to have a couple of drinks. Pomo had an awesome selection of alcoholic drinks to choose from. We had arrived at 10pm, an hour before they closed.  The staff was very friendly and I love the bar and the golden oven.  My only main complaint is that while we were enjoying ourselves, the staff was cleaning up, preparing for a soft close. While they were cleaning,someone was applying way to much bleach and was causing us nausea. Perhaps if the crew wouldn't use so much bleach or a different disinfectant so that the smell wouldn't Ingulf the dinning room, I would of been a lot more satisfied about my experience."}
{"text":"We are Gilbert residents and love what is happening with the downtown area. Every time a new restaurant opens, we jump at the chance to try it. None have warranted a 1 star review till now.  Be advised that my review is based entirely on the food. And this was TAKE OUT.  The atmosphere comes out of the same bland design book that all of the other unoriginal \"fox concept\" style restaurants on the strip share. All of the houses in Gilbert do too so who cares about that.  The service was fine, a pleasant young lady answered the phone and took my order at 5:56 pm. She told me 15-20 minutes so I arrived at 6:09. It was done. Glad I showed up early to the flavor party! Again, pleasant hostess, etc.  Boxes seemed hot when I picked them up and how could they not be right? They are cooked in a million degree sparkly hipster pizza oven n'est pa? I immediately Jay Walked directly across the street to my truck and sped home, anxious to try whatever authentic Italian offering was so definitely waiting in my tiny little pizza boxes. We live less than 2 miles door to door from Pomo and I hit all the green lights. 5.25 minute drive maybe?    I arrive at my home, whip the boxes out on the counter and fling the tops open. At first glance, the pizzas look like someone dumped Campbell's Creamy Tomato soup on a pizza crust. Bah! I think to myself, don't let your eyes deceive you! This place is one of the only places on the Gilbert strip to get 5 star reviews out of the box.  KID'S!!! PIZZA'S HERE!!!!  Do I wait? What do you think?  I grab a paper plate and wrestle out a slice of each; the BUFALA VERACE and the PORCINI pizza. Well, in this case, my first impression was correct. The pizza was cold. Cold. The flavor was bland. Bland. The Porcini mushrooms had mouth feel similar to ***COVER YOUR EARS*** ...I can't even say it... think garden slug meets oyster. My favorite tomato in the universe, the San Marzano plumb tomato was supposed to be the star of this pizza... I think it got hijacked by the afore mentioned Tomato soup. The crust was soggy in the middle, reasonably crispy on the edge and salty. Like really really salty, and kind of strangely bitter too.  Enough of the sub par pizza... I would have rather thrown in a $2.37 Costco cheese pizza.  Let's talk price. I'm guessing that these are 12\" pizzas. I measured the box and it seems reasonable that they are. I bought a total of 24\" of pizza for a whopping $37.62 that's $1.58 per inch.   I don't know why I did that math there or how that relates to anything but I can tell you THIS: I don't want to spend $1.58/inch on ANY food item unless it really, really \"KNOCKS MY SOCKS OFF\" or is \"To Die For!\"  What's that Zinburger? I know, I know... I will never cheat on you again... :/"}
{"text":"Super fast service and Abby was super sweet and amazing! I loved her energy and passion! She was extremely attentive and always made sure we were good even when the place was packed. Ordered two types of pizza, the Donna Rosa and the Pomo. I didn't try the Pomo but the Donna Rosa was delicious! We also ordered the Creme Brûlée and the Tiramisu. Both deserts were delicious and not overly rich in sweetness. Would come back to this place for the pizza and Desserts when I'm Back in Phoenix. Busy neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and waiter Chris was honestly one of the best wait staff I've had in a long time! Manager or owner came by to make sure everything perfect as well! Will be back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner this evening. Just ok good. VERY overpriced for the quality. A side of meatballs (2) was  $9.99. Asked for bread and they said there is a charge. Say what? One and done for us. Too many other options in the Gilbert area now."}
{"text":"Seeing the new places in the Heritage District has been great, and my husband and I have been trying as many of them as we can, as we like to keep our money in our town.  Unfortunately, these new restaurants seem a bit pricy for Gilbert.  My husband and I ate at Pomo yesterday afternoon for an early dinner. The place was not crowded, and our server was awesome. We started with a couple of beers - Peroni for me and a German pils for my husband (side note: my husband is not a fan of these new \"funky\" craft beers so to have an authentic German pils on the menu was great) - and the caprese salad as an appetizer.  The salad was very good, with thick tomatoes and mozzarella and basil.   For our entrees, we had the lasagne and the Bufala Verace pizza, as we prefer the bufala mozzarella. The lasagne was very good, with lots of meat layered with the noodles. Just a tad more sauce on it would have made it even better.  The pizza was also quite tasty, with just enough crunch in the crust.    After we had finished our dinner, our server offered the dessert menu. I love Creme Brûlée and Tiramisu, so I was torn between those two choices. Our server, however, suggested I try the Panna Cotta instead, for something different. I'd never had it before so I cannot compare it to anywhere, but it was very good. You could see the vanilla bean in it, and it tasted really good with the accompanying blueberries, raspberries and sliced strawberries.    Why I am giving them a 3-star review, then? Well, our total, for 3 beers, appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and tip, was $91, which we feel is too much for downtown Gilbert, making Pomo a place we will only visit for more special occasions. (Zinburger is also very good but pricey as well.)   Hopefully Gilbert will add some more affordable casual restaurants so we can partake more frequently."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I'll start with the good. Pizza? Incredible. We had the prosciutto arugula pizza and it was to die for. My husband had calamari and said it was great. Drinks were good. Bar tender was friendly.  The disappointing: Service was pretty slow, and when we only ordered one drink, our waitress stopped coming over. Also, we were there at 11:00 on a Saturday morning and they were out of the Crocchettes, which are on their morning happy hour menu for either $4 or $5, if I remember correctly. How they were sold out by 11:00 a.m., I have no idea. The waitress suggested a saffron rice ball appetizer, but it was $10 so I passed.  All in all, it was a good experience. We will likely return for more pizza!"}
{"text":"Very lukewarm response from the hostesses as I arrived. Server took approximately 5 min to greet our table. Her personality and attitude were the best part of the visit. My Nero D'Avaola was warm,  appetizers and pizza had no flavor. Only good food item was the Tiramisu. Overpriced, bland food with spotty service. No thanks, I'll go back to Sal's Gilbert Pizza."}
{"text":"Best Pizza coast to coast.   I read all the reports of the best pizza in the country and ate at many of them.   I thought Scuola Vecchia in Delray Beach Florida was the best.  The sauce and crust at Pomo is amazing."}
{"text":"It was a nice surprise. We accidentally found ourselves there and decided to try the food. I had pasta and have to say it was really good  The service was also nice. We will go back"}
{"text":"Although it was a bit pricey, the size of the pizzas coupled with the quickness and friendliness of service and delicious taste deserves about a 4/5 stars. I liked the principe pizza the best of the three we tried. 3 pizzas fed 5-6 people perfectly."}
{"text":"Top notch pizza place!  Everything was delicious, staff was super friendly (special shoutout to our waiter, Eli, who was outstanding!), great vibe throughout and the manager seems like a very nice guy.  I think Pomo is a wonderful addition to the Heritage District!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and cool atmosphere.  The marinara sauce is a miss and the salads are nothing special.  I would like to go back as they had a lot of cool and creative things on the menu.  Service was slow(wasn't that busy) but they were attentive.  If it wasn't for the amazing pizza, this place would probably be at a 3 - 3 1/2 Star."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had been anxious to try this place and we are glad that we finally did.  When we arrived, the dining room was on a wait so we decided to sit on the patio.  I am not usually a fan of patio seating but this was rather comfortable.  Eli, our server, was awesome in every way.  He was very attentive and made some great suggestions.  Eli kept our glasses full throughout the meal and whenever we thanked him, he said \"my pleasure\", which was a nice touch.  We had the Mista, Don Alfonso, and a Nutella Pizza for dessert.  All of it was top notch.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really cute and nice place we love how the pizza oven was glittered we had calamari and it was amazing wait people were so wonderful and nice the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it was a little tacky that the wait staff had drinks in their cell phones on top of the pizza oven but other than that course it was late they were probably ready to close it's a great place and food was amazing"}
{"text":"Great place. Food was very good, seems similarly priced to other restaurants in the area although slightly high for pizza. Mozzarella wasn't bad, tomatoes on the capresse weren't too flavorful. Principe pizza was outstanding.   The reason for three stars? The service. They use NoWait but seemed disorganized. Hostess made excuses for it a couple times. We put in for a table for 3 (us and baby). They asked us to take a table for two, because a party of 13 (registered after us) needed the 4-tops. It was kinda tight and the baby kept grabbing at everything.   After that, service seemed disjointed. Lot of people running around (ran into me a couple times). Everyone is nice but everything seemed really disorganized and a little rushed."}
{"text":"Food was great. On the negative side of rating, happy- hour only applies to patrons at the bar, and service was a bit weak."}
{"text":"Decent food. My husband and I came for lunch. He had the pizza, our son had pasta and I had the gnocchi. All were tasty. We decided to visit a second time to get pizza to go. We were told that no one knew where the pizza chef was and was currently unavailable. Of all of the employees there (manager included) you would think that someone would know how to operate things. It was a waste of a trip and our time because we couldn't order what we came to specifically purchase."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was amazing. My very grumpy boyfriend didn't like anything on the menu so he wanted a salad but the place didn't have ranch so the manager went next store and bought ranch so that my bf could have a salad. So incredible!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, at a great price. The atmosphere is very modern yet accommodating. It's located in the nice, chic historic district of downtown Gilbert, and serves pizza.   The wait staff was impeccable. We were very well attended to, and Katie, our server, was very efficient and pleasant- rare to see in any profession!   Our food was also very good; the meatballs were very well put together and seasoned (I noticed a few other patrons using them as additional toppings on the pizzas they ordered.   The pizza is made naples-style, and is fire-kilnes in a certain manner leaving the crust on the outside crispy and soft in the middle. This was great, but my only note is that the pizza I ordered (the Pomo)... Seemed like its toppings were pretty lop-sided. However, the ingredients used on it were top notch and tasted great.   We left filled and happy."}
{"text":"The service wasn't good when we went on a Sunday afternoon. Took about 10-15 minutes before we were acknowledged and servers were helping the tables on either side of us. Had to flag someone down. The bartender took our drink order and after she brought the drinks, she said she'd be back to take our food order but never came back. Had to flag down a server that was again, helping the table next to us but didn't acknowledge us. The family that got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we arrived, got their order taken before ours did. The pizza was delicious, but the service is what brought my rating down. Prices are a little overpriced too. They didn't seem too busy either, but maybe could've used one more server. Or better servers who are aware of patrons sitting and waiting and not being acknowledged or helped. Clean up the service and you'll stay in business and thrive."}
{"text":"I always eat at pomos pizza and it was great I don't know what happened but the pizza comes out usually cool to lukewarm and tasteless so I don't know what's going on over there"}
{"text":"The wife and I swung past on the way back from a concert at 10:40 p.m. last night. I gave the hostess an out to kick our butts out but she said no problem. No accusing looks from any staff for showing up late or subtle hints to hurry up.   We were both extremely happy to see they have vegan cheese. We both thought we were going to be stuck with sauce and veggies like every other pizza joint."}
{"text":"Great location. Loved sitting outside at dusk and people watching. Pizza was tasty. Martini was strong but good. A little pricey, but to be expected in downtown Gilbert I suppose."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. It took them over an hour to bring the food out. Our waiter wouldn't look at us. We had to ask another waiter to lol got ours so they could take our drinks. The food was bland and overpriced. The pizza had no flavor. I was extremely disappointed. For 8 people, we paid over $220 dollars. And we did not order any specialty anything."}
{"text":"First time to Pomo, my daughter had been there and I wanted a gourmet pizza we went and had the Bufala Verace and Capricciosa and both were fantastic.  We started the night with an appetizer of Fritto Misto - baby squid and shrimp floured with spice, homemade sauce. Unfortunately there was a golfball sized burnt chunk of some unknown thing on the plate with the squid and shrimp.  The manager came over and comp'd the appetizer since the charred golfball shouldn't have come out to us. This was not expected and was very nice of them.  After the meal was done we decide to have a dessert  and chose Creme brûlée, well as luck would have it they were out of Creme brûlée so they comp'ed our dessert which ended up being Torta Nutella - flourless chocolate hazelnut caked with a italian nutella cream, covered with chocolate ganache topped with gelato.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"The meatballs and the pizza were great! Some of our friends had the bruschetta and it looked delish! The tiramisu was really good but the cannoli' was just ok. All in all the service was good and we'll eat there again!"}
{"text":"It was good! We enjoyed everything we had. They didn't have the Sauvignon Blancs on the menu but they still had one to offer and I was happy with that. Good service, good food"}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I tried Pomo for the first time! We had passed by and noticed it was kinda busy so we called to ask about reservations they don't do reservations- they do this thing called \"call ahead\" so you need a table within 30-45 and they text you when it's ready! Which is awesome! The pizza literally only took 1 minute to make, we learned the oven is at 900 degrees meaning it only takes 60 seconds to make, and let me tell you the pizza was delicious! We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have ever had.  Been here four times now and the quality is consistent and the service is fantastic.  I literally have dreamed about this pizza more than once.  Nothing else has compared!"}
{"text":"I had the beef carpaccio which was not bad.  A little too much arugula but no big deal, can pick it off.  Son had the kids pizza.  Everything came out really fast which was impressive !"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner.  This time our experience with the waiting staff was superb, and we even tried the dessert!  Creme brulee and Tiramisu (can't go wrong with either one).  Their pizza and pasta as good as always."}
{"text":"This is a nice little pizza and pasta place in downtown Gilbert.  Would have been 5 stars, but they were out of a couple of wines that we ordered, plus the Chardonnay was not cold.  I had the Toto pizza, which was very good.  DW has the lasagne, which she says was nice and tender, but slightly dry, but fresh noodles. The Caprese appetizer was very good and so was the bread with olive oil and olives.  We come here regularly and recommend this place.  It's a little pricey, but the ambiance makes it worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"This to me is an overpriced pizza joint. The food was ok at best, although I will have to say that their Bruschetta (not sure if I'm spelling this right) was pretty good.  To me the sauce on the pizza wasn't even that good, and I've had it all over the country.  My friends talked this place up which is why we decided to try it,  ehh.    The service could have been a little bit better, it seemed as if the waitress took our order and never came back to us until it was time to pay the bill.  We had to get our refills from other people, although she was walking around our general area.  I will have to say that the ambience was good, they had some nice mellow music going on in the background and just the right amount of  noise."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, friendly staff good prices! The downtown Gilbert area is nice and this place has a patio that has a great atmosphere. I even brought my two kids 5 and 3 who loved the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice. The food came out quickly. It was tasty but pricey. We sat at the pizza bar and got to watch them make pizzas, but we also got to watch the staff interact with each other which was at times questionable in front of customers. Our waiter was the bartender and he was very nice and attentive but very very strange. Our drinks were great and the beer was really good also. Just not somewhere I would go again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Inside dinning area needs more air conditioning.  But more importantly, the pizza was very mediocre.  Soggy in the middle, did not hold the toppings.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Price does not match the experience. Service was competent and courteous, so I would give 3 or 4 stars here. Ambiance and seating is similar to a fast food restaurant, not unlike any other pizzeria (e.g. Peter Piper). But it is set in a big hollow room, with nothing to absorb sound. Consequently, it is extremely noisy, what one might experience in a school cafeteria. Good if you are going to dinner with someone you would rather not talk to. For those that like the frenetic noisy \"vibe\", it would be a 3 or 4 star experience. For me it is a 1 star. The food is where the rubber hits the road (metaphorically speaking). Started with a glass of Chianti and bruschetta appetizer.  The wine was fine and reasonably priced at $9/glass. But the brushcetta was very disappointing. It consisted of toast piled high with diced tomato. Way too much tomato, most of which had to be brushed aside to eat the toast. The tomato had no flavor and appeared to be standard grocery store variety Romas (i.e. picked well before any flavor developed on the vine). For the price one would expect ripened or maybe even a flavorful heritage variety would be used. Moreover, no basil or garlic flavor at all. Green fleks on the tomatoes appeared to be parsley. Asked for a side of basil and was given a small bowl of whole leaves that I had to dice up, crush and sprinkle on the tomatoes. Individual pizzas are pretty pricey (around $15 each). Toppings, cheese and sauce are flavorful, not over cooked and spiced well. Crust is so-so. Oven baked the right amount, but had a cracker like consistency. I rate the food overall (taking price into account) at 2 stars. Have eaten at the Scottsdale location a couple of years ago and it was a much better experience. The Gilbert location has not brought the same quality with it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here tonight for my birthday dinner because I was craving pizza and this place popped into my head. We had a birthday brunch, so by early evening we were starving. We came here right around 5:00pm on a Sunday night and were seated right away. It was fairly empty, but as our meal went on it got a bit busier.  Our waitress was kind of brusque, but on top of things. She was extremely efficient with the refills and such, but could have been a touch more friendly. Honestly, though, she did her job well and there are really no complaints on service.  We ordered the calamari appetizer, and I was hugely disappointed (hence the 4 stars). The calamari was soggy, but the breading had a good flavor. The sauce for dipping was horrible. It's like they forgot to season or salt it, so it was like dipping the calamari in tomato paste. I usually place a lot of weight on a restaurant's calamari (it's a favorite of ours), so if this had been our first time I might have been hesitant to order the entrees. Lucky for them, this wasn't our first time.  I had the porcini pizza and my husband had something with pepperoni and spicy salami. They serve the pizza with red pepper olive oil, red pepper, and Parmesan cheese. That red pepper olive oil is the jam. So, so good! The porcini pizza is absolutely to die for. All of the pizzas we've tried here are amazing.   All in all, after the poor experience with the calamari I would be hesitant to try anything but their pizzas. However, if you are looking for an amazing pizza place, look no further!"}
{"text":"Pomo is the best Italian food I have had in the Phoenix area- and it may even be better than some of the Italian food I have had in Italy! Incredible food and service each and every time. I am fond of the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations, too, but Gilbert is especially laid back."}
{"text":"The first Pizza we had in AZ was Pomo(in Gainey Ranch) and we have been hooked since then! I love the flavorful pizzas they offer wether it be from the kids menu or the regular one. The salads are large enough for sharing, and so are the pies.   Our friends also got us hooked onto their oils for dipping. Seriously addicting! So much so that I always buy them to go!"}
{"text":"Went there today for 1st time, they were super busy yet so accommodating to our request to b seated inside. Got a seat right by the pizza oven & were able to enjoy watching entire cooking process. Our waiter, Jimmy was very attentive, took our drink order & gave us time to look over the menu. We placed our order, appetizer & pizza. Excited about our arancini order, when here comes the manager to let us know they were not available... She quickly offered to pay for any other appetizer, actually she paid for two of them!!! We chose  the bruschetta trio & meatballs which they were delish!!!! The entire experience was amazing... Other business should learn from Pommo Pizzeria!!!! Cibo e servizio eccezionale!!! Sarà di Nuevo di sicuro."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Pomo on a busy Friday night but we beat the rush. :) I have to say this was one of the best Italian meals I've EVER had which is saying a lot considering I have a Sicilian family. My palate is extremely spoiled! Life's good! ;) we started with the meatball appetizers that were in a simple but delicious marinara. The meatballs were seasoned well and very moist. We had the all meat pizza and can I just say I was amazed by how well the flavored balanced out on this pie. Yummmmmmyyyy!!!! For dessert out sweet and prompt waitress brought me some Panna cotta for my birthday which was exceptional! It was a perfectly made vanilla bean Panna cotta that had fresh berries and beautifully presented. The plate looked like a work of art! I was very impressed not only by the food and staff but also by the interior design and flow of this amazing new Gilbert hotspot. Just lovely."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by my entire experience. My fiance and I were seated right away, although there were at least 2 dozen people waiting outside for a table. Our server was very polite and friendly. He kept our water glasses full, and brought our drinks out right away. He recommended the Toto Sapore. It was excellent! And it only took the kitchen about 5 minutes to bring it out. The crust was chewy, but with a slight crispness. The sauce was perfect, and the pancetta was delicious. I am the type of person that dunks every bite of pizza in ranch dressing, and sprinkles parmesan cheese excessively on every slice, BUT, I'm pretty sure parmesan and ranch would have ruined this pizza. It was perfect the moment it came out of the brick oven."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to go here for a nice Sunday lunch. Pomo always knows how to give its best with the service provided and the food serviced! The service provided by our bartender, Misael, and the manager, Christine, were amazing, we could not ask for a better experience. We are planning to use this space or catering for our upcoming wedding events!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went in last weekend. We have been patiently waiting for them to open and were excited to finally go. I will cut to the chase. We were very disappointed. We started with drinks and an appetizer. The app was their version of calamari and shrimp. It was pricey and very bland. I had to cover it in salt just to make it palatable. Drinks were over priced and unimpressive. After the uneventful pre-meal, we decided to play it safe and order their signature pizza, the POMO. Can't go wrong there, right?.... Well, it was absolutely bland and tasteless. Terrible pizza. Not sure what all the hype is about this place. I live in Gilbert and frequent the Heritage district quite often. Believe me, there are far better choices all within walking distance to this place. Needless to say, I will not be going back to Pomo any time soon."}
{"text":"Nice location for a family dinner. We were able to share 3 pizzas for a 5 person family with a couple slices left over. Not a lot of ingredients on the pizzas because they are simple, but that's the style. Great service!"}
{"text":"Umm, DELICIOUS! My friend and I tried POMO as I was getting ready to leave Arizona and move back to Pennsylvania. It was slightly busy (we went around 7 PM), but we saw a few seats open at the bar so we sat there. Bartenders were extremely helpful and gave us very generous portions for a great price! We split the calamari which was fantastic. We both got pizzas. I got a Margherita pizza and YUM! Crispy, cheesy deliciousness! Great environment and atmosphere. Loved it! If I were still in AZ, I would definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, consistency will be the death of them. And I know the setting is cool with the big garage doors but man, close me during the heat of the day and cool the joint down. It's cooler outside than inside due to the musters and breeze. Very uncomfortable inside. Blah!"}
{"text":"The hubby has been wanting to try this place so we went on a rare date night to celebrate his birthday. Based on the website, they didn't appear to take reservations but we were seated quickly, getting a table for 2 within 10 minutes of arriving around 6PM on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, the short wait was the most impressive thing. Our waiter was very polite and did his best but the wait for and quality of the food were disappointing.   The hubby ordered the porcini pizza which arrived well before the grilled veggies I ordered from the appetizer menu. The crust was good but the sauce was salty and bland and the mushrooms were surprisingly slimy. Nonetheless, he was halfway through it before my grilled veggies arrived. The wait was so ridiculous that they ended up comping my second glass of prosecco.  My husband ordered the torta della nonna and cappuccino for dessert. Again, the cappuccino wouldn't have arrived until after my husband had finished his dessert if he HAD finished it. The texture was so firm and the pine nuts on top so soggy that this bona fide sugarholic didn't finish. The cappuccino ended up being comped as well   Ultimately, the place was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Another delicious joint to use an excuse to visit Old Town Gilbert. Joining some amazing eateries, Pomo is making its mark in stone oven pizzas. The menu has an abundant list of options to make your pie hit the right note for you. Visited last night with some friends and had a great experience. The seating was quick, the service was attentive, and the food was delicious. Impressed with their fresh bruschetta and starter options. All pasta is fresh and handmade. Salads and soups are also entree choices. They have several Italian beers on top along with a wine and cocktail list. Their fresh brewed peach tea was delicious. Our table ordered two pies - margherita and a prosciutto/artichoke/mushroom/olive one. They both were eaten up quickly and the crust was spot on. I ordered a Kale Romana salad with grilled shrimp. Very good, a little dry. Kale needs dressing help always. My husband had the pasta. He and I were both surprised how much he liked it. He comes from an Italian family and has a wife that makes her own pasta and gravy so he will sniff out the frauds. He loved it and would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Been to all of Pomo locations.  Phoenix, Glendale, Scottsdale..... This one is my favorite.  Beautifully designed restaurant in every detail.  The atmosphere takes you to Italy if only for an hour!!  Even a good portion of the staff is Italian.  Great pizza, pasta, antipasto's, etc...  Great job guys.  Gilbert has a real Gem...."}
{"text":"Extremely nice date night! Cool place to sit outside at the bar and watch a game or sit inside and watch the pizza magic or just sit and stare at your loved one(s). You choose  Our waitress was so professional and fast and observant. It was awesome service.   The margherita pizza was so gooey and brick oven-y! YUM! My husband and I split it between the two of us but we also got gnocchi because I am a gnocchi freak and I just had to lol. The pizza was perfect and the gnocchi, although being on the extremely cheesy side, was also very good.   We will fo sho be back"}
{"text":"Stopped on a Thursday around 5:30 PM. Not busy at all. Waiter was knowledgable and friendly. We ordered 4 pasta dishes, 1 chicken salad, the 2 meatball appetizer, 7 pieces of bread, 4 waters and a glass of wine. $104 before the tip. Waited a little over 30 minutes for our food to come out. Hate to think how long it would have been if they were busy. Portions are on the small side but very well prepared. I just never heard of an Italian restaurant charging for bread. Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"It was good! reminded me of pizzeria Bianco. It was a little pricey but good pizza. Love the chill infused oil they have a the tables."}
{"text":"Wow. I enjoy quaint places but this place is not that good. I wanted to order the meatball appetizer but they were already sold out and this was 6pm in a Sunday. Place was not busy so i guess i missed the crowd or they are not making these on Sunday. Disappointing!!!!  Pizza was ok but over priced for what you got. Pasta fagioli was aweful along with the TAGLIATELLE ALLA BOLOGNESE.   Won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not my favorite pizza. Thought it was dry and bland. Salad was ok but small. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went to this location for a friends birthday(Group of 6 on a Wednesday). We were seated immediately. I'd like to start off by saying this is the closest thing to authentic that I have found in Arizona. The atmosphere is wonderful and our waiter coincidentally had an Italian accent which added to the experience. This place is a little pricy but it's well worth it. Perfect for a date or leisure meetings. Pizza is a good personal size and the tray(I forget the name) of assorted cured meats and cheese with garlic bread goes great with a glass of wine. Do yourself a solid and check this place out."}
{"text":"Food: not a long wait. Food quality is great. Pizza is oven brick.   Service: fast, kind and caring   Environment: fun, clean, several tables  Parking: free lot"}
{"text":"Pomo in Gilbert delivers just as the location in downtown Phoenix.     I came here not sure if I would be experiencing the same service and high quality pizza I have come to love from the downtown location.  And they fired on all cylinders without a hitch.    First off, it gets very busy so plan on waiting accordingly (45min-1hr).  Nice thing is they take your phone# and text you when ready so was nice having a drink across the way while we waited.  For the reviews on here about the place being small. Well that's what makes it awesome. The downtown location I feel is even smaller but I love the closeness it brings to the restaurant and keeping the feel of downtown Gilbert a modern local feel.    The pizza was excellent. Quality ingredients with a perfect done crust. The service was just as outstanding  they were extremely busy during my visit, but everyone not just our waitress made sure sure all our needs were met.    I love Pomo downtown Phoenix and safe to say Pomo in Gilbert is a hit."}
{"text":"This was a very nice clean restaurant, it had nice friendly staff and fresh ingredients. I gave it a 3 because I feel it was over priced, I get they are importing their ingredients but the food was just ok, the crust was a 5 star but again, not anything I would crave. Now saying that we will go back, the table next to use ordered the meatballs and they looked great. This review is on three different pizzas we tried, the rest of my group liked it a lot."}
{"text":"I've visited Pomo in downtown Phoenix, but this is the first time to Pomo in Gilbert.  Overall was a great experience. Food was good with solid service.  Restaurant atmosphere has less personality than the downtown location, but it's likely because it's so new.  I look forward to watching Pomo grow with popularity."}
{"text":"Tried Pomo for the first time tonight and we were hoping we had a good pizza place to go to now that we moved and we were so happy when we left.  Parking has been super easy anytime we have gone to downtown Gilbert. There is the garage or the big empty lot. Pomo has a great location right on the main road. The restaurant was much smaller inside than it seemed on the outside. We went on a Tuesday so we got seated right away. I would definitely want to make a reservation if I went on the weekend.  Our server was very sweet and attentive. She gave us a few recommendations, which were both good .  We asked about the Arancini Siciliani as an appetizer and she said it was her favorite so we ordered that and it was delicious. It's fried and cheesy whats not to love ! We ordered the Don Alfonso and it was very tasty ! I haven't been a fan of sausage on my pizza but their sausage was so good. And I usually leave the crust on the plate and don't eat it unless it's delicious; and let's just say , this was so delicious I wanted more crust!!   I am so excited that we loved this pizza place, and I can't wait to come back and try other pizzas and bring some of my girlfriends and sit at the bar this time."}
{"text":"Having been to the Scottsdale location and loved it I was excited to try the Gilbert one ! It was delicious with a new nice patio and bar. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table but got a drink at the bar outside. It was hot outside but they had misters on and it's pretty comfortable. We ordered the kale salad, meat plate and each our own pizza. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Pomo in Gilbert about ten times. I've held off of completing a review because I really like the concept and really think this place \"should\" be good. Alas, it really isn't.  Positives: the pizza is pretty tasty, and they have a decent variety of options to choose from. We've had several appetizers, soup, and salads. All are very good.  Negative: my chief complaints with Pomo are service related. We went last night (Saturday) at about 830 pm. The place was full but not on a noticable wait. We found two seats at the bar. Almost immediately, we could tell the staff was weeded. It took several minutes for someone to notice us, and she didn't actually notice we were newly seated guests. Why you ask? The bar was filthy. It was as if staff was refusing to clean dirty dishes in an effort to prevent new bar guests. The night really didn't improve from there. It took several attempts to get the staff attention to order an appetizer (calamari and shrimp) and the sell time of our app was about 20 minutes. We weren't the only guests with issues either. Nearly every food delivery came with an apology for time. The couple on one side of us was given a won't order. The couple on the other side had to ask for their pizza to go because it took so long.  Pomo probably survives because downtown Gilbert is packed with people and EVERY restaurant fills up on the weekend. However, I know this place is a ghost town during the week and it might be time for a staff meeting to address the reasons why. I'm not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome service! Price can get a bit high but you get a ton of food for it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The inside is a bit loud so we sat out on the patio where it is quite pleasant. Despite it being hot outside the misters kept it cool and we had an enjoyable time. The pizza is the closest thing to pizza in Italy that we have found. We had the Bruschetta Trio and the flavors were great. We also had the margherita pizza and quattro stagioni. The crust was thin, flavorful and soft. I preferred the margherita but my Mom and sister preferred the quattro. The waiter brought my Mom a panna cotta for her birthday. He was very attentive but not overbearing. A great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Went here because of a referral about a week ago. Owner greeted us and server took our order. Sat here for about 30 minutes and the whole time the owner was smiling at us and assuring us our food was almost done. About another 10 minutes go by with no food and my husband and I decided to leave. Approached the owner and she said \"Have a great night\" knowing that we haven't even had our dinner. Told her about the wait and she insisted on boxing up our food for us at no charge, the problem was, our food wasn't even prepared yet to go into the oven. HORRIBLE!!! Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with my friend and I must say our server was excellent to the T! We were able to sit down right away even though the were busy (Postinos down the road was a 2 hr wait) so we'd thought we'd give this place a try! I was a little bummed that the drink I ordered was no longer available but still on their menu... and the second drink I ordered, the Moscow mule, did not come in its classic copper cup :/ but not a biggie.   For appetizer we did the mango salad which was great! We also split the potato gnocchi sorrentina which was phenomenal, loved it! And of course, we had to try their pizza! So we went with the Pomo recommended by our waitress and it was delicious! Added a bit of their chili oil on it too. Yum yum yum is all I can say right now. Would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Is it the best pizza I've ever had? No. But it's definitely a welcomed addition to the East Valley. I love that the kitchen is an open concept which allows you to see them make your pizzas. The service was super friendly, and even though it's a fairly new restaurant, I feel like they have their stuff together. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is really good, I am giving them 4 because the food quality is not amazing but good. Customer service is on point. Their specialty pizza are the ones to choose from. The Affogato and Tiramisu is what we got and we did like them for dessert!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place so I was excited to try it.  My reviews are similar to others:  Pros:  Great ambiance, beautiful decor.  Good service.    Cons:  Temperature of the restaurant is HOT, due to the heat from the wood fired oven.  Best place to sit is on the patio, or far away from the oven.  I ordered the pasta with bolognese sauce because the server did NOT recommend the gluten free pizza.  He said it was not good - many others had sent it back.  Well...the pasta was terrible.  I wouldn't say that if it wasn't accurate.  The ground beef and red sauce tasted extremely bland and had the consistency similar to dog food.  No joke.  The meat was ground very soft and the sauce was gross.  Everyone in my family took one bite of my carryout when I got home, and were all shocked I didn't send it back.  I threw it out the minute I got home. The pizza is the most popular thing on the menu.  It's tasty, but not great.  The ingredients on top are sparse, the crust is good, but not great as other reviews have stated.  The crust is softer in the middle than I'm used to.  Overall, I might return and try something different, but only if a friend reeaally wants to go."}
{"text":"This location is a disappointment to the brand. Service is always lacking and they are always apologizing. The Phoenix and Scottsdale locations have much better staff and overall better environments. The last two times we have visited, something has been forgotten, most recently the pizza (how does that even happen at a pizza joint!) The time before that our check never came, I had to ask the bartender to find our server who literally had disappeared. They always attempt to make it right which is commendable but I prefer it just be right the first time. I will stick to the OG Pomo and Scottsdale from now on."}
{"text":"Great pizza... But remember that the totte and the dona Alphonso tastes almost similar.. you should probably order a vegetarian pizza. Also one pizza is good for two...! :)  Great substitute for the Moscow mule :)"}
{"text":"The calamari here is the best I've ever had. Such a light batter, not at all greasy like many other places. I also loved their new sparkling wine, although I cannot remember what brand it was. All 4 of us had different types of pizza and everyone LOVED all of them. Should note that my fiance is the world's most critical pizza judge, as he is a former chef who owned an italian restaurant. Also a nice patio, great for people watching in downtown Gilbert. Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"\"AUTHENTIC\" isn't the word I would to describe this place.  First off it looks like every other place down town Gilbert.  We ordered a pizza and a salad.  The pizza toppings were good;  bail,  eggplant one.  The crust on the other hand was void of flavor all together.  The chicken salad was the same, dry and flavorless.  Our server was amazing and the staff seemed to really care.  The wine was good"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple days ago and it was amazing! I had the classic bruschetta to start. It was topped with a ton of tomatoes and it tasted super fresh. Then I had the Capricciosa pizza minus the ham and it was delicious. I usually don't like thin crust pizza but this was perfection. I found it to be reasonably priced as well!  The customer service from everyone was outstanding. I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in a long time. It really remands me of original Italian style I used to have while visiting Italy. This place is a must if you are looking for a thin crust pizza with home made tomato sauce, and a right amount cheese. They have impressive collection of wines as well."}
{"text":"Went in to grab a bite for lunch. First time. Waitress recommended a few things to try. We started with the bruschetta and got the margarita pizza. They both had tons of flavor, have heard this place is just like gramaldis but I think this place is way better. Perfect patio for this nice patio weather. We will be back."}
{"text":"The waitress was amazing. So attentive and friendly but the pizza...wow. Worst pizza I have had in years. Cold, limp, no cheese, watery sauce and fell apart when you picked it up. The pizza was cold the second it touched our table. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, decent service. Food is so so. In my opinion way overpriced for what you receive. If you like a good atmosphere this is a good place. But if you're looking for food at an economical price this isn't the place for you. I don't mind paying $16.25 a plate for food but not when you the portions are small. It's only pasta!!! Ha ha!!!"}
{"text":"As an Italian citizen that come straight from Italy i have to say this is the true deal. If you want to eat real italian Pizza this is the place to go;the crust was perfectly done ,crunchy on the outside,nice and thin in the center.All the ingredients are on point,fresh and tastefull.  If you want an American pizza this is not for you! All the names in the menu reflect the same names you can find in an Italian menu,from antipasto thst means appetizer to all the different pizzas name ,simple and italian like they are supposed to be. A quik reminder that bread and balsamic vinegar with oil is not an Italian thing,so seems legit they dont do that.The waitresses were all super nice,groomed,very knowledgeable and fast. We waited for like 15 minutes and our pizzas were delivered to our table ,hot and delicious.   I did ask for a after dinner liquor,classic italian one and my waitress didn't know what it was,but hey not worries i didn't expect for him to have a knowledge of every single italian food,or wine,or beer or liquor.  I give this place 5 star,if i could i would go for 10.  Best place for a real italian pizza,if you complain about it maybe you should just stick with dominos or pizza hut."}
{"text":"Pomo is great! Love the atmosphere, bar area, patio & wait staff. We ordered the Toto Sapore it was good, a little too meaty for me, but my husband liked it. We also ordered the Donna Rosa which was the shrimp pizza. We ordered it because it sounded interesting and it was REALLY GOOD! I have been back a couple other times and always enjoy myself."}
{"text":"I initially went here for my birthday last year and the Bolognese was great! Best I've ever had! I had been craving It and went back two days ago to grab it to go and when I got to work to eat it was so disappointed. It was so dry, the noodles stuck together, not to mention it was a smaller portion than I had encountered before. Especially for it to be $17 bucks... it was kind of funny bc they gave me this huge bad with this small container lol  Overall ok.. advise would be not to order it to go"}
{"text":"Wait was 45 minutes for a table, so my friends and I sat at the bar. Great pizza and bruschetta! Plus the bartender was very friendly and fun. She answered all our questions and even had the bruschetta cut into thirds instead of halves, so each of us could sample them. :)"}
{"text":"Went there on Valentine's Day and it was an amazing experience our waitress was super helpful and incredibly polite! She had us in tears laughing and would always come by to check on us even though they were quite busy! We even saw the owner checking in with almost all his customers what an amazing guy! The whole scenery in this restaurant is romantic and not the awkward quiet kind! It's definitely a place you can come in chat and eat some delicious Italian food! My boyfriend and I decided to split and pizza and pasta. Definitely appetizing  if you're on Gilbert road on a date this would definitely be my first choice!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with a friend, had a very nice waiter named Michael. Michael was very attentive and very professional and couldn't ask for a nicer young man to wait on us.  We shared the Principe Pizza and it was delicious. He brought out a dessert as well for us to share as we were celebrating my friends birthday. It too was delicious although I don't remember the name of it. Will definitely go back not only because the food was divine, but the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"We came in for dessert. We ordered tiramisu, cannoli and creme brulee. The cannoli was hard as a rock and the creme brulee was runny. We won't get them again."}
{"text":"Take your money elsewhere. The food here is EXTREMELY over priced and you will leave feeling unsatisfied and underwhelmed. Don't expect your pizza to have a lot of toppings or cheese on it. The style of pizza they present you is flimsy and is often burnt due to the oven they use. They warn you on the menu of this \"wet and moist center,\" but even if you avoid the pizza, the other menu items don't make you say \"wow\" either. Our whole dinner party described their food as \"meh\" and left their expensive plates of food unfinished. We didn't even want to take the leftovers home. Also, you will feel the heat while dining as they often open the garage and the place isn't well air conditioned. We went in the late evening and you could see visible sweat on us and those around us.  I gave Pomo 2 starts due to their kind staff. Otherwise, it would have been a one star."}
{"text":"Thank you Christine for fabulous service, spot on wine and food recommendations and wonderful service. We are fans!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Our only issue is with the limited menu options. If you don't get pizza, there really isn't much. My wife ended up getting a bowl of Pasta Fagioli and I got a really good pasta. We probably won't be back only because we really aren't \"pizza for dinner\" people."}
{"text":"Was not to impressed at all. The middle of the pizza was kinda soggy.  And multiple of the pizzas on the menu all seemed to be the same.  Don't think I'll be back.  It was a full house when I was there, so I guess other people like it."}
{"text":"This was my first time their and we had amazing service the staff was super nice and very accommodating to our large party size. They were very helpful and attentive. The food was delicious! We got 3 pizzas and 2 pastas and shared them. The pasta del giorno was our entire tables favorite! After it was gone we still kept the plate just to dip our bread in the sauce. We definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Yum! It was our first time here and we tried the Pomo and pepino. Both were delicious! Travis, our server,  was great and our food arrived promptly. The wait to be seated wasn't bad for a Friday night. We are definitely looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Clean. Simple. Good taste. Mostly pizza and panini sandwiches. They have other selections however you should come for the pizza. Pretty good. Thin crust. The crust is fairly tasty. The sauce is wonderful and the topping choices are very good. Price?  Wish it was a few dollars less. But I will return."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Had to ask for service several times and ask for refills. Both times I got drinks the glass wasn't washed. Food was pretty decent though."}
{"text":"We went here for the 1st time for my birthday and the service was great! Everyone was very nice and super pleasant. The pizza we ordered was delicious - de-lish-us!! We were totally disappointed in the appetizers and the pasta fagioli. We ordered the bread/olive oil/balsamic vinegar - I was envisioning fresh from the brick oven bread - what we got was sliced, cold bread that could have come from Safeway. The other app we ordered was the meat/cheese board - and while the meats were delicious and varied, we were given 3 measly sticks of some yummy parmesan cheese - it would have been nice to have had some variety there - and for $$ it was a little skimpy. The pasta fagioli soup we ordered was plain weird. My mom and I both leaned over the bowl, peered in and said, \"what IS that?\" It was a weird, milky/pink/brown color filled to the brim with pasta & white cannellini beans - that was it. The tiramisu & the panna cotta were lovely - although the panna cotta had a small wedge of broken off plastic in it! So - a solid 3 stars. 5 stars for service & pizza, 1-2 stars for soup/apps."}
{"text":"$50 for 2 person pizzas and 2 teas. The young waiter was obviously trained on the bragging rights as they are one of the limited certified  authentic napoletana pizzerias. So since he appeared to be educated after showing the menu I asked if they had capacola? He had no idea what I was even asking and I had to explain what it was. so much for traditional Italian knowledge. The pizza I ordered had so much Basil I thought I was eating a salad. I had to ask for another plate to remove the pile I had to remove to get to the pizza. As for the quality or taste it's no better than FRIED PIE or MOD pizza, in fact other than the pizza was a little larger I would say it was a total waste paying over 3 times the cost of the other pizza places that let you select any item you want for the same price of just over $7. I can't imagine how this will last, if it's the certification that added the extra cost then it certainly doesn't reflect in the taste or quality. Yes It's fancier than the other trending pizza joints but not worth the crazy cost difference."}
{"text":"Terrible food bad service. First and last time to go there.  But on a good note the manager Alex comped our food."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe i shouldn't have read Yelp reviews before entering here,,, FYI, People with less than say 10 reviews, or people that only write negative reviews shouldn't be considered valid towards making decisions to try out places...  Came here for a friends Birthday and thought AWESOME ,, Finally get to try this place, and let me first say the Staff are Awesome.  Really Really nice staff.  Great selection of items for an Italian joint... I was almost taken aback when i asked if they had 4 peaks/kilt lifter on tap,,, errr, this is Italian joint, knucklehead.   Appetizer Fritto Misto Very Fresh squid yummy,,, yummy, the breading was pretty good but a little soft.. but fresh squid yes, yes,,, the homemade sauce was a little off, it was Good, but there's that one flavor that has you wondering if it belongs or not..  this would be a 4 star rate if this was only thing we ordered.  Pizza - of course we tried the POMO...  Now reading the mixed reviews i was trying to not judge the crust before trying, and well,,, some of you posting are crazy , as the Crust was AWESOME , nice crunch, little char'd in some areas, just seemed so fresh n delish.. Now add in the fresh toppings,, woot woot, we are on a roll baby..... #@$%^$# wait,,,, whats the sauce is this ?.... Strong Tomato sauce, and ??? hmm not much activity for my pallet in the sauce and it has a metalicky tinge to the flavor as well..... but the Crust and topping n cheese would've made this a 5 star joint...   I might try this place one more time and get a Pesto based pizza, and then the place will be rockin ?  so for me,,, 3.5 stars but not 4,  / Yelp please add the 1/2 star option any day now.."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert, Arizona has just been graced with the presence of one of the best pizzerias in the planet, and it's only minutes away from my house. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.   The pricing is very reasonable and worth every penny with the quality of the food you order. Great flavors with excellent dough right down to the crust. Plus, the massive brick oven serves as the centerpiece to a great dinner out at Downtown Gilbert. Lastly, tip your servers well, because the service is some of the best out there!"}
{"text":"Recently ate here with a friend for her birthday and got to sit at the bar. If you get the chance, try to sit at the bar so you can see the pizza being made! We had the Pepino and Calzone. The Pepino is a must try, full of flavor and very crispy. Also, if you are looking for something different to try, their calzone was delicious as well! Very cheesy and the salame piccante inside is quite tasty. Overall a good experience here!"}
{"text":"If you've been to the downtown phx pomo location, just imagine the same pizza without the magical creamy limoncello, the charming urban personality, or intimate vibe.  Without that it's still a decent place, the staff is friendly and fills your orders quickly, the pricing is fair, and the wine list is some of the best italian juice in the valley.   I'd recommend to stick with pizza (topped with pepper infused oil) & tiramisu for dessert. Keep it simple."}
{"text":"I've been to the Phoenix and Scottsdale location, both service and food were on point. Came with friends to try Gilbert location. Checked in online to get on waitlist through Yelp. Got there and told first hostess we checked in on Yelp since there was a wait. I saw the computer and my name and she said we were next in line. I thought that was easy and conveinent. Waited 5 minutes outside came in once I saw the party in front of us was seated. A second hostess an older lady came up and asked how many in our party I said four and we checked in on Yelp, she said it must of not came through....odd I actally saw my name on the computer. I told her the first hostess checked us in and I saw the confirmation on the computer. I think this upset her as she tells me it's now a 15-20 minute wait, with no one waiting in front of us. I told her I guess it's useless to check in through Yelp, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I looked a few steps across and there was a Zen Burger. Walked in and was seated immediately. This location has lost my business forever.  I love Pomo, but Gilbert location and hostess not so much."}
{"text":"Ok now the first thing I thought was,  \"oh great all we need in downtown Gilbert is another Italian eatery\" And do you know what? YES WE MOST CERTAINLY DO! This restaurant has some of the most delicious pizza you will eat in Gilbert. And for dessert we had tiramisu. Now I'm not a fan of tiramisu but this restaurant knows what they're doing when it comes to dessert as well. This restaurant it's a wonderful addition to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place has some major hype so I thought I would give it a try. I did not like the food in the least nor would I recommend it. I only had the pizza so I should not say that the food was not good as there are other things on the menu such as salad and pasta; however the pizza was frail. First off, they push the Neapolitan certified stamp of approval but this is certainly not even close to authentic; dough is too thick, dough is under-cooked, dough does not have that stone and wood taste to it, sauce does not taste like San Marzano tomatoes, and it lacks overall flavor. The service however was good and the ambiance is somewhat nice. They have a nice outside seating area. I might go back to try the pasta but its a bit expensive. If you want real and authentic Neapolitan pizza I would recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was really not impressed. My boyfriend and I went here because Zinburger had a wait of 45- 1hr . The menu  was kind of like their way or no way ...we say at the bar (it's full service) but we had to look for our waitress every time . I won't be back but it was nice trying something new!"}
{"text":"We went to Pomo on Friday night. Sat at the bar on the outside. We were immediately attended to. We were only there for drinks while waiting for our table at another restaurant. The drinks were taste. The bartenders were not only very attentive but very up beat and smiling. Our experience with Kenzi and Bret will bring us back for dinner."}
{"text":"Sad. :( I LOVE downtown Gilbert's foodie area. I do try to give a place the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I'll try them again.   I would come back for the bruschetta- it was well seasoned and fresh. Tasty. We got the trio, but had to ask what was in 2 of them because they didn't explain on the menu. They didn't cut them so I had to cut them in half with my butter knife. What?  I was really excited about home-made pasta. They made a point to mention it on the menu. We did ask them to swap the penne that usually comes with the Penne All' Arribbiata with one of their fresh pastas. They did - but the pasta was waaaaaay under cooked. Al dente' should have a bite to it, but this pasta was raw. It literally tasted like dough. I've had good home-made pasta; this was a fail. We sent it back and the waiter was great about it, but it's like he brought out the same dish when he came with a replacement. We didn't press the issue- obviously this was their best shot. They missed.  We had dessert - Torta Della Nona - it wasn't amazing, wasn't bad. Really pretty, which I like in a desert. Or food in general.   I am hoping they had an off day, and I think everyone deserves a second chance. But it's soooo hard with restaurants like Liberty Market, Postino, and Joyride inches from their front door...we'll see."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Michael was amazing and great conversation! I had the spaghetti carbonara and it was the closest I've had to real Italian carbonara since visiting Italy!"}
{"text":"First visit to Pomo Pizzeria and was a wonderful experience! There was a slight issue with the timing of our food coming out all together in our party of four and the manager promptly came to the table and apologized as well as made things right actually above and beyond my expectations and more than right. We will definitely be returning with friends and family."}
{"text":"I've been to the Pomo in Phoenix a few times and never had a pizza that didn't rate 5 stars. Luckily the brand new Downtown Gilbert location is just as good. I came here for lunch on the day they opened (today!) and chose my favorite, the Napoli.   Fresh, delicious and everything I want from a true Italian pizza. Friendly service and a nice dining room make this addition to the Heritage District restaurant scene a very welcome one.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Super tasty pizza, engaging service, slightly high prices, but overall worth the experience.  We can't wait to go back, I hope they are consistent!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Took over a hour to get our food then they were still missing and entree which was a pizza that they said cooks really fast.  That took another 20 minutes. Appetizer was the only decent food item.  They look under staffed and disorganized.  Waitress didn't even Knowledge how long it was taking for the food and didn't offer to comp the pizza especially since it took even longer. Manager didn't seem to be present. Wouldn't recommend or dine here again."}
{"text":"Tried Pomo for the first time at their new Gilbert location.  My wife and I were out for dinner with friends and wanted to try something new.  We had the brucheta trio and the Toto Sapore.  Our waiter was friendly and polite.  He answered our questions about the menu and offered suggestions to help us decide.  It was a busy Saturday night during peak hours but the food and cocktails came out in reasonable time.  It took a while to capture our waiter to order a second round but I give him a pass as the place was quite busy. The brucheta was fresh and the pizza reminded us of a trip to Europe earlier in the year.  The pizza was thin and authentic Itallian cusine. Overall the experience was great.  Total cost was about $25/person and we felt good about tipping generously. Tried it again for lunch a few days later with similar results. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service. The meatball appetizer has one of the best marinara sauces I've ever had and the carbonara was great. Moderately priced. I'd go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on moderately busy Monday night. We were seated immediately at a lovely table on patio.  Perused the menu..  and we waited...   And waited...   And waited...   And watched as others who've been seated after us receive their drink orders...   Not even water for the table..   My husband became upset. We've been painting the interior of our home all day and were famished.   Needless to say, we walked out and had an excellent dinner down the way.   I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe we will come back when we are appropriately dress like we'll drop some money."}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is excellent. The food is delicious. Love chatting with Brett, Lorraine, Alex and Jen. Like Family!"}
{"text":"I looked down at my pizza and the heat fogged up my glasses like some sort of nerd who saw something sexy.  Just kidding. I had my contacts in but I did see a sexy pizza in front of me!  I love Pomo's and with one being so close to home in Downtown Gilbert, nestled nicely in the Heritage Marketplace, I'm over the moon! Great ambiance; beautifully golden tiled, wood-fire, pizza oven where delicious pies are cooked; and a friendly staff! EJ was our waiter this afternoon and he was super friendly, charismatic, and those dimples! Phew!  Since we strolled in shortly after 1:30PM, and after the lunch rush, there was absolutely no wait time.  It was nice and clean, the A/C kept us chilled, and EJ kept the waters full and the food coming!  Here's what we had:  Bruschetta Classica:  Homemade Pugliese bread, roma tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil, and evoo.  I love me some bruschetta mainly because I'm a carb-whore and love bread!  The bread was toasted to perfect crunchy-on-the-outside-and-chewy-in-the-middle median and the fresh tomatoes were delicious.  Splash on some of their house evoo infused with crushed chili flakes and I'm in Heaven.  It was the perfect antipasti!  The Napoli:  Described as, \" Imported Fillets of Anchovies, Basil, Sicilian Oregano,\" I was immensely pleased with how delicious this came out.  The thin crust was on the chewier side which I wasn't anticipating since it was baked in a 900°F wood-fire oven and was pretty flimsy.  There was a good amount of cheese-drag whenever I bit into the mozzarella and the smoky salty anchovy was delicious.  It was a delicious combination that made my skirt flip.  The Pomo:  \"Italian Sausage, Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Sauteed Onions, Sauteed Mushrooms.\"  While I only had a single slice of this bad boy, I gotta admit, I wasn't too impressed.  The crust held up better with The Pomo than The Napoli but it was kind of vanilla.  Eating this pizza, the one that's suppose to be \"the house\" and special, was kind of bland.  It needed a kick from some crushed peppers.  Good sauce ratio on this thin crust pizza.  Crème brûlée:  We wrapped up the meal with a classic crème brûlée.  We were actually torn between the brûlée and tiramisu but I was offered the dessert I wanted.  How could I say no?  Perfect caramel crust and a smooth creamy custard.  It was a bit strong on the vanilla but I loved it!  The strawberry shaped as a rose looked pretty but I wish they cut it into slices so I could eat it with my brûlée.  Also, I'm never one to turn down a little whipped cream with my berries.  Just saying.  All in all, Pomo is a great place for a pie.  They're actually ranked in the Top 10 pizza places in town!  So give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The concept was amazing! Who wouldn't want a pizza made in 90 seconds. The employees were fantastic, but the owner was beyond rude. Granted, we never met the guy, but the way he treated his employees was so off-putting that I would have a really hard time giving him another dollar. With the competition in downtown Gilbert these days, the likelihood to return here is next to none."}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE. 10/10 would recommend to anyone! The service was phenomenal- especially Brett. He was so friendly, genuine, attentive, and answered every question we had with a smile. We couldn't have asked for a better experience or better pizza! Also loved how clean and modern it was!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza in downtown Gilbert... Must have the margherita pizza and the bruschetta too. Nice spot to meet friends"}
{"text":"One of favorite pizza spots! This pizza is beyond good and the service is always great at this location! I love how you can get bread and olives for just a couple bucks to start! Plus they have the chili olive oil at the table that makes a great addition to your pizza! The calamari and shrimp appetizer is sooo good as well as the dipping sauce! They also have 3 olives vodka on the happy hour so that's a huge bonus! Great attention to detail with that amazing pizza oven!  Everything about their pizza rocks from the crust to the toppings to the sauce... can't go wrong with the sausage;) This place is a must for any pizza lover!"}
{"text":"I am in love with the beef carpaccio! You can't find this dish just anywhere. Nor is it good when you do. However, Pomo's is delicious tender, thin, and melts in your mouth! The pizza is very good as well but their appetizer selection is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great as usual they were really busy and we still got personalize service. Nico at the Pizza bar  is amazing and is always friendly. Alex was our server tonight and it was amazing! We feel like family when we're here! As soon as we walk in its hugs from everyone! And how have you been, what have you been up to? Their pizzas are amazing!! Don't forget to try the Pizza Nutella!"}
{"text":"Anybody that has been outside the state of Arizona has had better pizza. Good god this place is a the epitome of craft (terrible) pizza. One time I accidentally shot diarrhea in my mouth, and it would have been a welcome taste to the vile that these folks pass off as pizza."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Pomo is very cool. Laid, back easy vibe. Bartenders are fun and chatty. The misters outside are way to strong and over powering. The prices are $3-$4 too much. Very disappointed that kids meals don't include a drink, so you pay an additional $1.50 for kids drinks. My oldest daughter got \"pepperoni\" pizza, but it was salami and under cooked. My younger daughter ordered pasta and it was a small amount for $6. My husband and I ordered gluten free and sadly, it was the worst gluten free pizza we have ever had. The sauce, the cheese and the toppings were great but the crust was not even editable. Extremely disappointed in the waiter for not asking how our meal was! He took our plates away, completely full, and did not ask us what we thought. Thrilled that downtown Gilbert is now a great place to hang out and eat, sad that Pomo isn't better."}
{"text":"I might be a bit biased since I used to work here, but I've tried just about everything on the menu. It's delicious. Everything tastes great when it's cooked in that oven. I am particular to the paninis, and recommend the Pompeii. It's not very accommodating for large groups, however, even with reservations, the location is just too small. The staff is very professional."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Awesome ambiance and atmosphere. Ask to be seated in Shelby's section - fantastic waitress that pays attention to detail. The Bufalo Mozzarella pizza was to die for and the Kale Ceaser was the perfect salad to pair with the pizza. Will definitely be coming back as the pizza reminds me of the one I had in Italy and a trip to Pomo is much more affordable than airfare to Italy!"}
{"text":"I love their peppino pizza.  It's my favorite.  Their sauce is delicious and the ricotta with sausage is an amazing combo. You don't really feel full either since the pizza is thin. They have a great drink menu as well. It's a place I frequent l."}
{"text":"Just finished up our first experience at Pomo in Gilbert. Our server - Jimmy was great! We ordered 3 different pizzas and they were all very good. Dessert - canolis and tiramisu were also delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
