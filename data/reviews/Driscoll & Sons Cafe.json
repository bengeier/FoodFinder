{"text":"We were so excited to try this place. Party of 4 seated at 6:30. Service was incredibly slow! Thirty minutes after we ordered, the waitress came back to our table to tell us that 2 of the specials ordered were sold out and asked us to choose something else (we had to ask for a menu to choose again?). Many items were unavailable. Dinner was finally served at 8:18 and the waitress didn't seemed phased that we had been sitting there almost two hours waiting.  Food was barely average. One of our party said her dinner was cold (salmon), the lemon sole had so many panko bread crumbs on it and was tasteless with no sauce, the chicken Marsala sauce was dark, thick  and tasted more like a teriyaki sauce.  We had planned on dessert but by the time dinner finally arrived, we were anxious to leave. You can tell that they want to serve good food, but there is a disconnect between what the kitchen can handle and the dining room staff.  We would love to see them get it together, but we won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. and I will never be back. I don't understand how this place get any business. the owner is the rudest guy on the planet. he sits across the restaurant and states at the younger girls. it's quite obvious. the food was cold the first time and I was served RAW CHICKEN the second time. I understand sometimes chicken is mistaken for cooled completely through when it isnt but there is no way they could be thought my chicken was cooked. it was raw half way through the middle. when we asked to speak to a manager he rolled his eyes and shook his head. no joke. he was walking over and we left. never going back. it's a shame because I was so excited to have a restaurant in my town."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype about this place in the area. I went with high hopes after reading the glowing reviews online. 

I guess for the area it is an exciting addition. Unfortunately, I found it to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. 

From the brightly lit atmosphere to the white dense bread and what tasted like vegetable oil for dipping to the overly oily french onion soup and completely tasteless overcooked entree, the only good thing I can say about this place is the bartender makes a pretty good slightly dirty martini."}
{"text":"Driscoll & Sons cafe is unassuming from the outside but the inside and the food is great. Great selection for dinner and they always have specials. The decor is modern but has a home like feel, it competes with some restaurants in pittsburgh. It will be even better in the summer, they have a deck and French doors that open to let the fresh air in and fans to help it keep cool. I ended up ordering the NY strip medium rare with carrots, their rice pilaf, and a cup of French onion. First let me say their bread is really good crispy outside and soft inside, the oil that accompanies the bread is great too. French soup tasted great, some places it's ridiculously salty, not here, it's flavorful. On to dinner. My steak was a generous portion and covered over the middle with a light cream sauce. I cut a piece without sauce and it was had more than enough flavor that the sauce was not warranted at all it was done to perfection full of flavor and very tender. The carrots were cooked right and had a nice maple undertone. The pilaf wasn't overcooked or watery and had basic spices. One person in the party had the Alfredo with shrimp, the shrimp weren't rubbery but done to perfection. The Alfredo sauce wasn't overpowering in the butter or cheese aspect it was a foot balance. Another person had a ribeye with potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were amazing I'd definitely order them. Prices, they are not expensive for what you get, a lot of food that tastes good, some people aren't used to paying for a good meal. You CANNOT compare this to the trailside AT ALL this place is in another league that the trailside could never dream of being in. I'd consider it above grill 51 and very close to j corks as far as quality. If they get their alcohol liscense and offer some nice wine and different mixed drinks this place will take it from a home run to knocking it out of the park and into the river. I will be back and you should go."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! One might not expect to find a place of such quality and atmosphere nestled in the \"boonies\" as some might call it, but Driscoll's is terrific. Fresh, inspired food from start to finish. My wife raved about the cheddar soup, and her eggplant dish. My ribs were expertly done. Tasty sides plus piping hot bread with oil and a fresh salad made the whole dinner fantastic. The service was friendly and helpful (thanks Nadine!) and the prices are so very reasonable. I'm almost embarrassed to admit we live 10 minutes away and just discovered this place. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice waitress that was wonderful. Other than that it was disappointing.  One person in our group had to send his meal back because it was burnt.  Another could barely get their meal down because the sandwich was so dry. My husbands eggplant was dark and over cooked. My shrimp alfredo was bland and my shrimp were like rubber.  Some of their menu items are overpriced too.  Under normal circumstances I would have just given it a three star rating but due to the owners rude attitude which we observed, they get a two.  If it had not been for the exceptional service by our server it would have been a one.  I'd never go back and neither will the other guests in our party."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. Food is always good. Have always taken coupons. This time, they wouldn't take it. Love the place, but they lost a formerly loyal customer over not taking a coupon."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience tonight. Will not be returning. 2 of the four of us were brought our meals a good ten minutes before the other 2 received theirs. Ordered steak medium rare and received it rare and cold. They fixed the problem by microwaving the steak and ruining it. Sides were cold. Asked for bread and they brought out a hotdog bun sliced up and charged me a dollar for it! Had to ask for silverware. Restrooms were dirty and door was not working properly. Ruined my evening."}
{"text":"Will NEVER go back. Tried this place again due to a semi-positive experience the last time I went and wanted to support a local business in a sea of nothingness. No improvements over last visit, and in fact, something unforgivable took place. It wasn't as crowded and service was quick to seat us and take drink orders. Salad and bread came in OK time and it was all very good. We waited too long for entrees. When they did finally come, as in the last time, one of the dishes had temperature issues. It was their \"blue bbq chicken.\" The taste was great, but it was mostly lukewarm and even cold in spots. The major problem dishes were the chicken piccata and the veal piccata. The sauces were toxically salty. Not a little salty. Not even really salty. TOXIC SALTY... INEDIBLE SALTY. The people I was dining with get nervous about complaining but I assured them that if I were the manager I would want to know. So they asked to speak to the manager. I don't know this guy's name and to quote his Western PA accent, \"Um not innerested in knowin' it neither.\" What an idiot. First, it was clear he did not want to come to the table to hear a complaint. Being the typical Western Pennsylvania manchild type, he shot nervous and even rude glances until he finally mustered the courage and came sauntering over with a very noticeable chip on his shoulder. We explained the salty situation. He sighed and said condescendingly, \"It's hard to cook something right without salt these days.\" ??? Whaaaaaat??? I smiled and answered, \"No no no... this isn't a little salty this is inedible salty.\" He was unmoved and acted as though there was nothing he could or would do about it. How do you develop an attitude like that? Do you hate your job that much? Were you raised by wolves? When momma wolf dragged home a stinking rotting carcass for you were you expected to gobble it down without complaint? We once again gave the chorus of how ridiculously salty the dish was.. nothing. I said, \"look this had the potential to be a great dish, but it was abjectly ruined with salt.\" .... nothing but more stiffening, bristling, and dumb-dumb machismo. He didn't understand what I said at first, probably because I used words with multiple syllables. When I asked him over and over to try it for himself and see for himself, he rudely and coldly stated, \"Um not innerested in tastin' it.\" He did offer to take ONE of the meals off the bill. My very elderly father quickly blurted out, \"No no we don't want anything free.\" Well... I DID want him to credit both meals since they were both inedible, but my father spoke and we were compelled to sit in uncomfortable silence. He took advantage of my father's gaff and said, \"OK then, I hope you come back,\" and walked away briskly. What a tool. CLEARLY he is uncaring about this business or the food. There wasn't ANY apology even a perfunctory one. There wasn't ANY remorse. He said he would \"taste it out back\" at one point... oh yeah? When? Later when it doesn't matter? It is totally sickening to go to a restaurant and have them deliver TOXIC food and expect you to pay for it without complaint. A simple sincere apology and a gesture of good faith would have been heartily welcomed. We could have walked out the door with no bill credits and STILL been happy if he hadn't been anything less than an idiot. But, he apparently wanted to inform us all very clearly of his assholish and rigid stance against customers, and he succeeded mightily. If you go and get one of the piccatas... take extra blood pressure medicine and pray you don't die, and given the food temperature issues, you might pray for immunity to foodborne illnesses too. I've spent many years traveling and I could fight off just about anything... thank god."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant.... There is an outdoor deck that overlooks a little creek.   Great menu selection.  The service was very friendly and the food was wonderful.  Don't miss this \"diamond in the rough\".  I will return."}
{"text":"The handful of times I've been here, I always feel so welcomed by the staff. Very friendly!

Every meal I've tried has been delish!"}
{"text":"I love Driscolls! Friends of mine live close by and every time I'm out in the Pittsburgh area from California, I have to stop at Driscoll's! Last visit, we went there for dinner and it was absolutely fabulous. This time we went for lunch and it was just as good. Our waitress was amazing and we were seated by the little creek so we could look outside. I ordered the steak wrap and asked her to put grilled chicken instead of steak and I was accommodated. My boyfriend had a Cobb salad and my adopted mother had a grilled cheese and she just loved it. Everything about this luncheon was perfect. Our waitress kept checking on our drinks which is always key to me!  Driscoll's is in a very small town and the parking lot is always jammed because it is the best place around! Whenever you're in the area please stop by! In the summer months they have an ice cream joint out front and that's perfect too. Kudos to the staff at Driscoll's!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan!  It's great to have a cute little local restaurant with good food.  The home made bread is also a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a number of times since it opened in March, 2013.  The servers have been friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  We have tried many of their menu items and have never been disapopointed.  The portions are large - I always take some home!  We have found that the specials that are offered are a step above what you would receive elsewhere.  The shrimp primavera served over small pierogies was to die for!  It's not a fancy restaurant, but they have achieved the look they were going for - sort of like a train depot.  You feel comfortable here - not pretentious.  It's rare that a new, family owned business opens in our area.  This one is definitely worth supporting.  Someone said it's in Sutersville which is misleading.  It is across the river from Sutersville, actually in Elizabeth Township, right behind The Yough Twister, which is also owned and operated by the Driscoill family.  Give it a try - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"First time we tried this place. Upon entering there was a showcase with a sample of the the daily special. A good thing because the portions were so large many people might just want to share one dish.  The restaurant is clean and bright with a spacious main dinning area with a choice of booths or tables.  We chose to dine in the adjoining Sun room with large windows that provide a nice view of a stream and woods. It was 13 degrees that day but we were comfortable even up close to the windows. They have a deck off the Sun room that I look forward to eating on in warmer weather. 
    The server was attentive without being intrusive, friendly but not \", Honey, Sweetie etc..\" She saw to our needs but allowed us to eat in peace. 
     My wife had the Sante Fe skillet and the portion was huge.  She said it tasted great and we brought home a large doggie box when she was through.  I ordered the sirloin steak and eggs and the steak was surprisingly good. Done just the way I asked, medium rare, not the usual over cooked leather breakfast steak. Very little waste ,fat on the edges that was easily removed.  The over easy eggs were delicious also and the home fries were great,not greasy or burnt,just right. With a coffee and a tea the whole bill was around 24 dollars. 
     We were there for breakfast so no booze but they have a nice little list of house wine \"14 Hands\" brand  with enough variety to suite most people.  Beer the same way with a pitcher of craft beer for under $9 . They have both craft and the usual old favorites by the bottle. 
     We are looking forward to trying them for dinner."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. Most recently on Sunday for brunch. I have had Eggs Benedict in numerous restaurants across the country. Here they were of the highest quality. The ability to prepare the humble egg is for me a criterion of a skilled chef. I look forward to a return very soon."}
{"text":"Great food, every time we've gone whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner it's been great. The Belgian waffle is the best ever! And the salmon dinner is perfect."}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place! Their Monte Cristo served with an amazing raspberry mayonnaise is by far my favorite. Have never had a bad meal here. However, last time we were there, I ordered an entree that was to have two sides... I ordered Eggplant Rollatini and wanted a salad and soup as my sides... was told I would be charged extra for my soup... when they are both clearly listed as side items... was a little perturbed..."}
{"text":"The first time I stopped here the food was good, my server was excellent (Jackie) so I stopped  again...
Good service , good food, and Consistency is everything...
Well I received my one and only soda...then I waited, and waited, and.......waited...
Finally ordered, whew...I was going to leave (20 minutes to place an order is while in a hurry is simply too long)
Now I'm waiting for my food...and waiting ...
The burger is burnt, char burnt, yikes, even the poor onion straws are burnt, ugh...I've now been waiting an hour and 5 minutes...no refill of my drink, no checking to see if my food is ok...
Finally the server comes, I show her my culinary disaster, one would think she would offer to replace my uneaten burger...NOPE...she offers free dessert 

I gave 2 stars because of my first experience otherwise it would have been 1  I'll try it again hoping for better next time"}
{"text":"I live a minute away from this place and often get take out wings. Their wings are pretty good. I've eaten in the restaurant three times and have gotten their take out a half a dozen times and have never once been greeted at the door. It's always an uncomfortable enterance every.single.time. That's what bothers me most. The rest of their food is pretty average."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch while riding the GAP Trail and breakfast three days later.  Best food on the GAP Trail"}
{"text":"We live pretty close to this place and always pass it when walking on the GAP. We received some coupons in the mail for breakfast, lunch, and dinner so we decided to try it out. 

Right off the bat the staff was very pleasant and attentive. My husbands coffee cup was never half full the entire visit. We were able to pick our own seat and the specials were displayed nicely. 

The menu selection was pretty standard, with a few unique twists thrown in(breakfast monte cristo!). I ordered a mushroom Swiss omelette and my husband had their veggie lovers skillet. We were excited to see an array of fresh veggies used. The skillet breakfast was both colorful AND flavorful. I had huge pieces of baby portobello mushrooms in my omelette. For the price, they definitely didn't skimp on ANYTHING. 

I think once they get some more staff hired this place will be fantastic. My husband and I look forward to coming back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"We were hesitant to stop because of prior reviews but we finally did. It was our loss for not doing so earlier. Starting from the greeting at the front door by the owner, to wonderful and unobtrusive service by Nadine, to the quality and quantity of our dinners. We have found a new dining establishment to frequent. Just can't wait until the weather breaks to sit outside."}
{"text":"Service was lousy, food was mediocre, over priced and owner was rude.  The only thing going for this place is its location.  Won't ever be back and highly DONT recommend"}
{"text":"We have given this place a chance several times, and the service has been terrible every time. The food quality is also very inconsistent."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the cafe. We were seated in the dining room and no one bothered to wait on us. Many other customers came in we're seated and waited on while we sat there with nothing.  Left hungry and upset."}
{"text":"I've been to Driscoll's several times and have been consistently pleased with the Club Sandwich and the burgers. They have ample seating and outdoor options during the nice weather. Located just off the GAP trail, it makes for a great mid-day stop when out biking or walking!

Plenty of TV's to watch a game and they have a full bar with draught beer, wine and liquor options. They do seem to get a little busy at times, I've driven by and seen the whole parking lot filled, but I've never had trouble getting seated right away.

They often have specials of the day (I haven't tried them) but the do plate them at the entrance to show what they are working with. Other friends have had the buffalo chicken wrap, pasta, and salads, and no one has had complaints!

One of my first times there we had an apple dumpling which was amazing! I'm not sure about the other desserts, but that one was worth remembering. If you see it on the menu, you should try it!"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast with our 16 month old. We were sat immediately. Had to wait 20 minutes for a highchair that we had to ask for. 20 minutes after that, still never had a waitress take our drink order. Having to wait that long at breakfast is ridiculous. We left. Bummed out because I really wanted to try dinner one day. I don't think I'll go back though."}
{"text":"An unexpected culinary delight in Sutersville!!  What an unexpected delight and a great addition to eateries in the area. We went for dinner about 6 months ago and were very happy with the quality hamburger on burger night. We saw some pictures of their nightly specials on Facebook recently, went down and were hooked. The dinner specials are something you might expect from a restaurant in Downtown Pittsburgh. Yes, that good. But it's not only the great presentation. Their food is excellent and the portions are HUGE! We've been there about 4 times in the past 2 weeks and we are pleased each time with something new and delicious. If you are in the area, treat yourself to a great meal. My guess you will have a take-out box when you leave with lunch for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Clean, new, quaint, and friendly with generous portions and very fair prices. Food allergy friendly. Salads, in particular, were good and the menu states that you need to REQUEST iceberg!

Only downside is that the menu could be expanded to include a few more entrees. But I am nitpicking here and I sincerely hope this place, which I was told is only slightly more than a year old, thrives."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience this past Sunday. There were 3 other table besides our table   We ordered our food and didn't get it for about a half an hr, when we did get our food it was all cold and potatoes were not cooked and no blueberries in my husbands pancakes. The waitress offered to bring some blueberries out and cook my potatoes more. The table next to us got their food which was also sent back bc of it being cold and they got my husbands pancakes. We asked to see a manager and was told that there wasn't one available at that point made the comment that he didn't understand why there was such a problem cooking for 4 tables. The waitress turned around and asked him if he would like to try it then. Very unprofessional staff, food temps not good and the jelly was expired"}
{"text":"The owners of this establishment shouldn't be owners.  Mr Driscoll is rude,  unfriendly, no personality and ignorant.  We had a large group there and our waitress busted her but just to keep up.  Driscol just sat at the bar,  wouldn't help her and the other waitress just stood around looking stupid.. No wonder they can't keep help. 
Food is average... Priced reasonably."}
{"text":"if you've never been to sutersville, let me paint you a picture. picture run-down, railroad track, river-hick town in the middle of nowhere.
then, out of the ashes rises driscoll and sons.
the restaurant is quite small and doesn't look like much from outside, but then you get inside and the atmosphere is almost swanky, and intimate. with indoor and outdoor seating, there still aren't many tables, but there is a small bar area as well, although i don't think they serve alcohol.
the menu is surprisingly high class. delicious and fancy looking dishes, and kind of expensive. the portions are quite large and really really good though, so they are definitely worth the price.
the service was good as well, and they just started serving breakfast on weekends.
honestly, i never expected a place like this in a town like that. this is a place you would find in pittsburgh and deserves recognition for sure."}
{"text":"What a great night at Driscoll's. Very tasty menu with daily specials. Open for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. The portion sizes are awesome and the bread with sun dried tomato dipping oil is to die for. I can't wait to go back and try a sandwich. I had yummy eggplant parm ... watch a massive bananas foster dessert go by while we were eating. Wanted to order it but couldn't fit in another bite! Great find in a very small river town."}
{"text":"Driscoll and Sons was a great place to stop for brunch on our last morning in town. It's so close to where we stay yet we never knew it existed. Kind of a hidden gem.

The set-up inside is simple and comfortable. The staff if very personable and attentive. Seems like they have a lot of regulars there which is always a good sign.

I had a meat lovers omelet and it was very tasty. Just the right mixture of meats and eggs. And a good size! Not small enough where I was still hungry after but not too big that I was overly full. 

I would for sure check this place out again next time I'm in town. Possibly for lunch or dinner to see how they are with that. They have brunch down pretty good in my opinion."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a month and have always had good service and great food! We recommend it to friends that want to try something new in the area. During the summer you can eat on the deck too which is awesome!"}
