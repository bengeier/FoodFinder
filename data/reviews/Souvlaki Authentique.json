{"text":"Food was terrible the chicken in the chicken platter was rotten . The salad was drowning in Cesar dressing. One great thing is the order came really quick .  Not good at all"}
{"text":"A recent tip from a Facebook group to check out this new restaurant that opened last March inspired me to try it out tonight. I kept it simple and ordered 2 souvlaki pitas (pork and chicken) and a side of Greek potatoes for takeout. The price and the wait time were reasonable. Most importantly, the food was excellent and am very happy to have such quality fare so close to home! I look forward to returning and sampling more of their extensive menu in the restaurant.  Lastly, the staff was welcoming and courteous and the interior is very clean, modern and very well laid out. There is ample parking space, wheelchair access and an outdoor dining area. The owner should be commended for putting alot of thought into the design of this establishment."}

{"text":"I have visited this place twice and both times were consistently great. Their prices are very reasonable, portions are more than enough and the meal tasted great. Service was quick and friendly. There are not many Greek options in the area, so I'm excited that this one offers such great food.   Their Greek potatoes are the best I have had hands down and their salad was crisp and fresh, not soggy like some other places. I had a gyro pita and the meat was juicy and well seasoned. My husband ordered the plate with two pitas and took one home for the next day, even day old and cold it still maintained its integrity.   New favorite local restaurant!"}
