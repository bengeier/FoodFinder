{"text":"Super cher pour de toutes petites portions. C'était bon, mais pas assez pour le prix ( deux tranches de concombre+ un morceau misérable de salade+ un bout de poisson perdu au milieu du mini bao)
Les frites étaient surgelées... Et en plus, il y en avait pas beaucoup! Tant mieux ! C'était pas bon !"}
{"text":"Excellent food for an excellent price!! The baos were very flavorful.  My favourite was the fish and the pork belly baos. A must try, is the poutine with Kimchi, and the fried Oreo ice cream dessert!!! So delicious, you will come back for more!!!  Thank you Bao Boys!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I heard that a restaurant is called BAO BOYS will be opening up. One thing I'm obsessed with is Bao sandwiches. They're so good when done right. 

We tried both the tofu and pork belly. Both were good and the flavours were pretty decent. I've had much better though.. And for the price I definitely don't think they are worth it. 

Let's be honest, Bao is all about the bun. It has to be fluffy and big. As for Bao Boys, their buns are TINY. I mean MINUSCULE!!!!! no picture will prepare you for how small these buns are. There is no fluff. They are completely flat as if I was eating pita bread. 

I was so disappointed because I felt like I had to order three portions to even feel slightly full. If you're going to name your restaurant Bao Boys, make the baos unreal.

Banh Mi Boys in Toronto killlll their baos. Just look at the pictures.

{"text":"Classic bao was the best I'd had in a long time! The kimchi poutine is brilliant. Apparently they just got their liquor license last week before our visit, which is great because this is perfect drinking food. Salmon bao also quite good. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Amazing bao. Went there twice in 4 days and would go back if I'm ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"It's good to see a bao spot open up in MTL. Their flavors are good, especially the fried fish and Korean-style beef. Their sweet potato fries are also good. My only critique would be that at $4 per bao, they could be a little bigger."}
{"text":"The last time we had Bao Tacos in Massachusetts we were disappointed with our experience, but tonight we dined at Restaurant Bao Boys and I have to say that we loved the experience.

The service here was great, especially since our French is poor. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the staff here is incredible. The prices overall were fair and when it came to the quality, we loved the baos.

My wife and I split their Korean boas and their original baos. The meat in the baos were well seasoned and the baos themselves were of a good consistency and didn't fall apart like some other restaurants we have visited. Our meals came with fries which were the best we have had in Canada, and the dipping sauce was perfect. The spring rolls we had as appetizers were great as well and it was a shame we only got two. 

The biggest issue we had here was that when we went to pay up we didn't have enough cash for a great tip, so we will have to go back to provide them the tip that they deserved. Also, just a heads up, they deliver, so be prepared to enjoy baos from home instead of paying an arm and a leg for parking in the area."}
{"text":"I am not very experienced with baos but i thought that the food was delicious. I got three different Baos and loved them all, I especially recommend the korean Bao.  Also the service was excellent, the guys were super friendly and definitely made me want to go back."}
{"text":"I loved it! Was in the mood for some Bao and got exactly what I was looking for. Nice menu, not too much not too little. Very laid back atmosphere and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Vraiment super d'avoir une place comme ça à Montréal ! J'ai goûté tous les baos et ils sont tous très bons, avec des assaisonnements très savoureux. 
Seul petit bémol : dommage les frites qui accompagnent les baos ne soient pas faites maison ..."}
{"text":"Yummy pad thai. And gluten free! Also, the owner, David, is very nice and took me through the entire menu on the phone, pointing out what was safe for me to have and what wasn't. Most people can't be bothered and seem annoyed by the questions or, at best, look at you blankly when you inquire about ingredients, so this is extra special customer service."}
