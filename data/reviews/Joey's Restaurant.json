{"text":"My wife and I found this place the way that we do with many local restaurants; Groupon.  We both had a very pleasant experience with this place. One thing to keep in mind, is that the dining room is very small, and they pack a lot of tables into a small area. Expect to hear your neighbors conversation, and to have the wait staff walking uncomfortably close to pass your table.  The food seemed to be authentic Italian. Everything tasted fresh, the bread was especially noteworthy.  With that being said, the food was overpriced, and we will probably not be back. Call me cheap, but I can make a good plate of pasta at home.  Go if you have a discount!"}
{"text":"Good food, high prices, nasty manager. Won't eat here again. Came for dinner with friends. Other couple had a concern about the size of the pizza for $16. Manager came over and said \"take it or leave it. This is the size and if you don't like it don't eat it.\"  Only ate here when we had a Groupon. That's why their prices are so high because they sell so many coupon companies, Restaurant.com, Groupon, etc. if you don't have a coupon when you eat here you're a fool"}
{"text":"Nothing to what it was when the father ran it. Place is not clean. Last time service poor and food was cold. Quality of food less than average. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant.  Acceptable staff.  Linguini with clam sauce, totally tasteless.  2 of us ordered it, and both ate a couple of bites and that was it.  When the waitress asked if we wanted a take home box, we both said no and at that time I told her that the chef should be told that it was absolutely tasteless.  The 3rd in our party had eggplant which was clearly a packaged product.  My husband had veal parmigiana which he said was fine but anything breaded with cheese and marinara on it will most likely be fine.  We will never go here again, although the monkey bread is as I remembered when it was located in Chagrin Falls"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT JOEYS.  Have any of you seen channel 19 dirty dining??  Joey's took the cake with over 12 violations.  The steps leading down to the store room have black mold all over them.  Last time I ate there I became ill.  Not the same place it was 15 years ago.  Trust me..."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant that has taken a severe fall from grace.  This once fine upstanding restaurant which oozed charm and even better food is now an extremely overpriced shell of what it once was.    My wife and I had recently made a trip to Joey's for an evening out and were both excited to make the trip.  I ordered the chicken francese and beer special of the day, while my wife ordered the eggplant parmesan and a glass of wine. Each meal was served with a house salad and side of pasta.  Both salads were very ordinary, much of what you would expect from a house salad in an itallian restaurant.    As the meals arrived, my chicken was as tough and dry as a roofing tile and as flavorless as one as well.  The side of pasta that arrived with the meal looked as if the kitchen had cooked the pasta, and dumped a can of diced tomatoes on top.  The sauce was clumpy with ZERO flavor and was extremely watery.  I complained to the waitress who returned to the kitchen and took the meal off the bill.  Despite the meal being removed the total bill still came out to $40!  For two drinks and one meal I was extremely surprised at how expensive this restaurant has become.    This is a sad day to say that I will never again go to Joey's for another meal.  With Little Italy in closer proximity to my house and a much better quality of food at comparable prices, there is no need to ever go back to Joey's.  Buyer beware, review your options wisely before going to Joey's and dropping a boatload of money for subpar food."}
{"text":"We never made it to the Chagrin Falls location of Joey's, but were pleased by the decor and food at their new location.  My friend had the chicken caesar, and I had the house salad.  Everything was extremely fresh, from the firm cherry tomatoes to the impressive mix of lettuces and tasty dressing.  There was nary a brown piece of lettuce!     We got a pepperoni/mushroom to go, and it was divine!  Service was pleasant but a bit slow for lunch, considering there were only four tables occupied, but we'll try it again for sure."}
{"text":"A nice little Italian place in a quaint little town.  The service was good, but not exceptional, same goes for the food.  I think the garlic bread they gave would have been much better if it wasn't luke warm, but it was...  I got the spinach ravioli, and it really didn't leave much of a lasting impression.  I remember it being well covered with chunky tomato sauce, which was also fairly bland.    Overall, it was OK, nothing special.   The company was great though!"}
{"text":"My love affair with Joey and his pizza joint have faded over the years.  I had a great first experience, but most visits have been mediocre recently.  I don't have any complaints about the decor of the place.  It's small and cozy.   It's somewhat dimly lit, and maybe is a bit dusty in the corners.  Character.    The pizza is pretty good, but not great.  I really like their thin crust pizza if they prepare it correctly.  However, they only do this about 25% of the time.  I've never found the waitstaff to be particularly competent.  They aren't rude, or particularly slow.  Just young and dull.  You're best bet is to skip the entre√©, and only eat garlic rolls.    Anyway, it's worth a visit.  You'll probably need to eat anyway after puking at the site of overly cute Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and most likely will not go back. Dining area was very crowded, tables too close together.  Food was overpriced and not very good. Pizza was ok.  Service was mediocre. Expected more of an authentic italian dining experience."}
{"text":"Yummity-yum-yum...  THE UP-SIDE:  This fantastic little Italian pizzeria/restaurant has been around for a long time; and for good reason.  The pizza is excellent, there's a good selection of other food, wine and beer, and the service is very friendly.  The atmosphere is exactly what I look for in a little Italian restaurant; it's quaint, a little dark, homey, and full of vitality.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  For once, I can't think of one.  ...oh yeah, my table wobbled a little.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  This is definitely one of my favorite Italian places anywhere. It's a must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I guess I'm spoiled with the likes of Mia Bella and Il Bacio in Little Italy, but Joey's is average to sub-par Italian food.  I gave them another shot tonight to improve upon that opinion, and they did nothing to do so.  Starting with the salad, the house dressing doesn't taste homemade (mine is better!).  The red sauce, the measure of any Italian restaurant, is pretty bland.  I'd actually give the manicotti a B+.  I've never had a good desert at Joey's and tonight was no exception.  The apple cobbler was doughy and flavorless.  We paid way too much for a below average meal.  I have to admit, my lunch at Olive Garden last week was better....sorry Joey's."}
{"text":"Great name, good pizza.  The go to place for casual American-Italian food in Chagrin Falls. Also Pizza.  I tried their pizza at the Memorial Day festival. My daughter, Joey (Josephine) downed a whole slice herself and she's only 2.   I'd like to come back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I was an avid joeys of chagrin fanatic until the move to Solon. I recently had the veal scallipinni, a $22 plate with which tasted great, however I could not see how anyone could charge that much for three tiny pieces of veal. I was still hungry after we left. My date ordered a salad, which looked fresh. Joeys of solon is a horrible value, with small portions. Bottom line  save your money and go to Jimmy Dadonnas down the street, you leave happier and with left overs. I left joeys empty handed and a empty stomach."}
{"text":"If your in the Chagrin Falls area this is a good location for very decent Italian.   The interior of the restaurant is small but with a great charm. Service for Cleveland area..normal..not excellent, not horrible, not even decent. Very willing to customize as well..extra star for same."}
{"text":"Just visited the place with my mom today. I will say the decor was quaint, and I liked the dark atmosphere, but the food had little to be desired. I ordered the lasagna, the menu boosted about the cheese, there was none in it. The bottom was totally burnt, and the meat filling was really bad. Mom had the cheese ravioli and she really liked it. I will say I did enjoy the wedding soup and the salad. Probably the best salad I had in a long time. My drink was real tasty and the desert was excellent. We will be back, but I know now what to order and what to stay away from. The service was good and the place was really clean ."}
{"text":"Lots of other valid reviews about this restaurant on Yelp, so I'll keep this simple.    Authentic Italian?  I've had the real thing.  Joey's may want theirs to taste like the real thing.  It's just not (see other reviews for reasons).  3 stars from me.  However, the food I'd expect at the prices this place charges?  2 stars.  Go again?  No."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm a little nostalgic, since I spent many weekends when I was a teen loitering around Chagrin Falls, with a lot of nights including a pit stop at Joey's. I think that the new location is cozy, despite being in a strip mall.  The complimentary garlic knots are as amazing as I remembered them, as was their pizza. I thought that the portions were generous (3/4 of my party had leftovers from dinner). Service was pretty good considering that I was last there on a Friday evening during dinner."}
{"text":"Nestled into its quaint little part of Chagrin Falls, this place is cozy and romantic. The food was decent: my appetizer sampler had burnt bottoms; the pesto pizza had nice crust but soggy bottom from some oil smeared allover the serving dish; the service took too long, even though some patrons were well taken care of.  That, plus their questionabe sanitation practices makes this a place I would only visit when forced."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a whim while shopping in downtown Chagrin Falls. The staff were friendly, the food was delicious (the garlic knots could have used more garlic), and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable diner of 2 small pizzas - a basic Italian sausage and a specialty pollo.  The 4 piece Italian sausage had lots of sauce, the pollo with olives, chicken, and roasted red pepper was more cheesy - less saucy.   Free garlic knots were offers for starters.  Service was fast and friendly.  The restaurant was clean, and warm on a cold day in April."}
{"text":"My friend told me this restaurant could rival any restaurant in Italy. He was particularly enthusiastic about the chicken parmigiano. The thick layer of cheese on top wasn't real parmigian bot mozzarella or American cheese. I ordered the garlic appetizer which consisted of two roasted half bulbs of garlic, toast, roasted peppers, and danish blue cheese. It had tons of garlic so I was happy. My other friend's chicken marsalla was also tasty. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was fine. It was just a little too, uhh... American in order for it to meet my standards for Italian food. While I doubt it rivals restaurants in the old country, it was still a charming little place. I definitely wouldn't mind going again when in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food here. I would come here again over any national Italian chain restaurant. Don't come here expediting a '98 Caymus Cab & a fresh veal scallopine. Come here for drinkable wine, family atmosphere, low key Italian American classics.  Pizza was better than most but not mind blowing. Pasta carbonara was good.very large portion w/ a salad but for $20 I'd skip it. Side of meatballs were good and homemade.  Slightly above average food. I will be back because the wife & kid were happy, Krystal the server was great & it's a low key kinda place."}
{"text":"The sausage pizza is among the best I have ever had; but that's what I would stick with.  My huband loves their Mozzarella sticks too.  Their marinara sauce is one of the few, other than my own, that I can even eat.  I wish they were closer than half and hour away- their pizza is so good we would eat it at least once a week if it were closer."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Smaller portions compared to other non-chain local Italian restaurants in Cleveland.  Service staff could use some training.  Not once did anyone ask if I needed anything or what I thought of my food.  The hostess was wearing tights as pants!?!  Which seemed a bit inappropriate, although unrelated to the food."}
{"text":"There is a saying:  Sex is like pizza.  Even if the pizza is bad, it's still pizza.  When it comes to Joey's, sorry dear, I have a headache.  The decor:  Musty, dark, old and scuzzy.  I think it is supposed to be quaint and cozy.  Maybe it was--in the Johnson administration.  Now it's just very worn, sticky and dusty.  The service:  Awful.  Our waitress mumbled something about \"them\" baking the bread and not having any then disappeared for a very long time.  Meanwhile the two other tables seemed to be getting huge baskets of bread.  When we finally found the waitress, she insisted they had no bread, then came out bearing a small basket of stale white bread slices.  She took a ridiculous amount of time getting our drinks, taking our food order and bringing our food.  We actually watched our dishes sitting under the heat lamp for a good 15 minutes before she thought to bring them to us.  She stood in the back studying her order pad-- although there were only 2 other tables.  The food:  Lame.  Mon cher chou, for the first and only time in his life, did not finish his lasagne.  He barely touched it.  It was bland, mushy, watery, off-tasting and just --bleh.    My daughter's meatballs were white.  White.  Seriously. She had to ask me what they were.  All filler-- no meat.  Her soda had the unmistakeable taste of beverage lines that had not been cleaned in years.  My eggplant sandwich wasn't bad.  It wasn't particularly good.  Merely edible.  I felt kind of queasy afterward.  So why do people rave about this place?  Is it because it is in quaint little Chagrin Falls?   Is it the Mama Santa's effect-- people have been raving for decades about it, so they continue to do so despite the current low quality of the food?  Who knows."}
{"text":"Another good dinner at Joey's.  It's halfway between work and home, so we often meet there for dinner.  Lots of pasta, salads, and yummy pizzas,"}
