{"text":"If you haven't tried Coach's yet, you're missing out. Great casual atmosphere, lots of beer, great specials, and the food is REALLY good. The nachos are amazing. They use pita chips (a spin on traditional bar nachos) and you can get beef, chicken, or pork on top. They also serve different flavors of fries such as cajun, garlic, and sweet potato. All are really yummy! Save room for dessert because they have a trained pastry chef & he doesn't disappoint.   Haven't tried it yet, but they're adding brunch on the weekends; I'll certainly be checking that out soon"}
{"text":"I was disappointed twice.  Never by the food. 1st time ordered a shot and beer.  Usually get top shelf liquor.  My shot was watered down and I told the barmaid.  Thought they should know something like that.  2nd time, was given shot...fine and good.  Ordered 2nd shot and heard barmaid tell waitress out of my top shelf and was giving me lesser brand.  The waitress brought it and never said a word.  When the bill came, I was charged for 2 shots of top shelf and $1 more on my food order than the menu said.  I was nickled and dimed by a waitress for I don't know why.  I don't think she owns the place, so, why?!!!"}
{"text":"Id really give this place 3.5 stars.   The waitresses were all vert very nice. It did take a little while to get our check but that was no big deal to us.   We both ordered the she crab soup. It was good. Had chunks of crap meat and a lot of it. It was served pretty cold and when we asked for a reheat, it was still cold.   The main courses are the best part of the meal. The portions are HUGE. I ordered a steak salad which had real steak onit, not that steak um crap you normally get. The FF are so good!!!! Try them the garlic parmesan way....you wont be disappointed.   Overall, we had a good experience. If it was 10 stars, Id give them 7. So im sticking with 3 but really Id give 7."}
{"text":"Was really surprised by the food. It was way above average bar food. I got their special burger with beer cheese, crispy bacon and grilled onions. They also have like 5 different kinds of fries I tried 2 and they were really good. Give this place a try for good drinks and better food. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because service was slow"}
{"text":"This Place is Great.   Great place to watch a pens game.   The wings were phenomanal"}
{"text":"I have never been there when the regular lowlife's haven't ruined it for the family. Talking trash out front and cursing at the bar. Same people every time. A dive bar at premium prices. I give up, won't be back. I advise families to eat at the dozens of other nearby restaurants who can manage the regulars."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends. We've been going to coaches for over a year now and we Love the salads. But this visit was not so good. The salads for example,  chix Ceasar, gyro, salmon ( $10-$15) or specialty salads no longer come with romaine lettuce or mixed greens. Waitress told us from now on it's all \"ice berg\" for all the salads!  It's sad that the quality has gone and the portions have also, (didn't think we noticed coaches) down but hey the prices are the same. We won't be going back as we can get iceberg salads anywhere. Felt bad for waitress she was annoyed too."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Server was very friendly. Had the corned beef wrap with sweet potato fries. Both were outstanding."}
{"text":"My friend and I go here for lunch once or twice a month. It is our favorite go to lunch spot. Their food is always hot and fresh. It doesn't taste like bar food at all! They servers are always friendly and knowledgable about what is on the menu.  My favorite menu item to order is the Pittsburgh Pulled Pork sandwich with the garlic Parmesan fries. Their portions are always more than enough! Their steak wrap is also really good, I love that they use real steak. If I had to suggest an item, it would be the sweet potato fries with the coinciding dipping sauce."}
{"text":"What more do I need to say other than 3$ burger night??  But seriously, the staff is always great, I have a good allergy and they always make sure they take care of me, which, for anyone with a good allergy is a homerun!   Awesome food, great place to go have a few drinks!"}
{"text":"Coach's is a great local hang out for my husband and I.  The place is always clean.  Tia is one of our favorite bartenders due to her excellent customer service and friendly attitude.  The owner, John, is typically around and is always willing to chat with customers.  As far as the food goes, the wings are some of the best that we have had.  We typically get Cajun or old bay.  The fries are really good and all of the appetizers that I've had are awesome.  Definitely try the pickles or mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came here on a Friday night and was ignored by the bartender for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Total yinzer place. Tried this dump a few years ago and it was awful. Stopped in for a quick bite to give it another chance after a long day.  Nothing changed. Place is filthy, non existent service and useless staff. We waited for 15 minutes for the dumb broad to take our order and she never came and took the order. I \"accidentally\" spilled my water on the table and floor and left. Ooooooops. Stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"If you asked me what I'd rate Coach's two years ago, I'd say prob 4.5. I can't say the same now because it feels like too many things have changed. The specials use to be great, the prices were low, the food was good, and that's what brought us in: great food at a bargain. Visiting here periodically over the last few years, something was different each time. 1st visit, no more half off appetizers during happy hour, 2nd visit, $.45 cent wings instead of $.35, 3rd visit, no more trivia night but name that tune instead, 4th visit, no more dollar tacos, 5th visit, no more flatbreads. You get the idea. Maybe they're experimenting, getting to know their market or the price of food is an ever-rising climb. Whatever it is, it's just too many changes in such a short period of time that I can't really trust that they won't continue to eliminate specials, change the menu, or raise the prices. You can't fall in love with something here or they'll change it. The plus side, though, there's a nice selection of beer :)"}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a while! I had a burger and my boyfriend had pulled pork. Both tasted phenomenal! The prices were decent, especially once we realized how much food we got.The staff is very friendly as well. Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Pens playoff game and it was busy but not impossibly packed. Was able to sit down and order and receive a beer and food very quickly. Miller Lite special during the game. .45 cent wings and 6.00 Yuengling pitchers 12-5 (Saturday).   I had the cheesesteak with Cajun friends and it was delicious. The sandwich had quality chunks of steak with onions green peppers and mozzarella. I've been looking for a great cheesesteak in this area - this isn't it but it is one of the better I've had in the area."}
{"text":"Always great food, good time & professional service.   A must if your a out of town er in the area.  Southhills Rocks.... D..."}
{"text":"I went to it before for launch it was disgusting the table was dirty and sticky. There was really bad smell and the food was too hot. It is also pricy. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I really like this place.   It is a sports bar first and foremost.  Many locals come and see Coach.   I have talked to Coach a couple of times - he is a very social cat.  This is a place where you can watch any Pittsburgh Sporting event, have good food, and drinks.  It is usually crowded.  The prices are reasonable.    The vibe is really good.   One of the reasons why I go back.  They have weekly food specials (Thursday $3 burgers).   If you are in the area, you should check it out if you are looking for a place to watch the game.    Service - Excellent - whether you are at a table or at the bar - the service has been great.  Price - very reasonable - Food and Drinks prices will keep me coming back if I want to watch a game and pay realistic prices (compare to a bottleshop).  Food - It is okay - I would not come here to specifically dine.  I would come here to meet friends share some wings and be social.  Environment - The vibe is great.   The bar area reminds me of a public house.  I just think everyone either knows each other or knows Coach."}
{"text":"Very good food and great bottle selection. Service was a little slow, but the restaurant was pretty busy for a Friday night so that is expected. Seems like they have good daily specials so will be back to try them.    Update: came back for wing night.  Place was packed. The wings were 45 cents and were awesome. Tons of sauce flavors too!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch a decent mix drink and tasty bar wings! Just your local neighborhood Sports Bar - clean, well maintained with a variety menu and draft list - perfect for a spot to watch the Local Sports team. Some of the best wings in the Area! And I travel for wings"}
{"text":"I debated between rating this location a 3 or a 4, truth is, I'd probably rate it about a 3.6, so I went with 4.  I have no complaints about my experience.  It was a late lunch, and we had our choice of seating locations.  The server came over right away to take our drink order, and she took care of us throughout our meal.  The food was good, we all had various sandwiches of different kinds, and all seemed to enjoy it.  That said, nothing particularly stands out about the place, at least not for lunch.  It was on the darker side, they had a couple of TVs on around, and the lack of a crowd gave it no atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Food is good, service is good, lots of tv to catch the games. Always has food & drink specials. Service is great. Family owned & super friendly!"}
{"text":"Mmm, mmm, mmm. This place rocks. I loved my reuben sandwich as well as the pub pretzels. Desserts rotate regularly and range from cheesecake to funnel cake. It was quiet for a sports bar which I like. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Typical bar,nothing special.... Nice bar menu,over 10 draft beers and a lot of bottled beers as well. They have some famous PITT. Burgers that they are really proud of. Over all 3 stars.....not bad but not good at th same time."}
{"text":"I have been twice now in the past 3 weeks.  The shopping plaza is hectic, but has plenty of parking.  It's a little loud in the evening, but is a great place to watch the game and sports highlights for those who are interested in that attribute.  The service is moderately attentive and friendly enough, needing an occasional reminder on a food item, and is not what brings me back.  I really like the quality of food for the price and the speed.  I come here when I want fast service of hot, fresh food, with a good range of choices from bar food to traditional choices to comfort food.  There was a long cider and beer list, including IPAs and also the very sweet ciders and hard root beer that I enjoy.  For what I come here for, it is 4 stars.  If I had the wrong expectations of this bar / restaurant, it would be a 3 star, but I don't and I happily give it 4 stars and will return again and again."}
{"text":"This place was incredible! Such a hidden gem. Everything was delicious, the menu was huge, it was comfortable and totally unpretentious.   At our table, we had an order of mild wings, a buffalo chicken grilled cheese,  soft pretzels with beer cheese, loaded beer cheese fries, and 2 orders of buffalo Mac & Cheese. No one had any complaints about anything and we will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection, solid food, and amazing desserts, what else do you need?  Hidden away in a strip mall is this place which once you get inside has a pretty decent atmosphere.    Suggestions? Beer Cheese anything, especially the fries.  The carmelized onions really seal the deal on the deliciousness.   Also, try the desserts, they have rotating desserts and are absolutely delicious.  Save room because they are a must get!"}
{"text":"The bar is clean and the food is pretty decent for a bar. The daily specials with their food and drinks are a steal. Bringing your kids here is fine. They have a dining area in the back and accommodate the young. The prices are reasonable. The drinks are made well. They have plenty of TVs to watch the games on. The dining room is big enough to also accommodate larger parties. Check the website out to see what specials are going on for that day and/or week. They have a ladies evening(night) day on Thursday starting at 7p... They often have events to attend and buffets for them. Like I said. Check out their site."}
{"text":"Good bar food. Service is decent. Good place to watch sports. Great sport atmosphere with all the biggest sporting events."}
{"text":"I've been to Coach's twice and both times I've been a big fan. The first time I went to Coach's I had popped in for some lunch.  It happened to be wing day.  My bf was super excited. I got some chicken tenders, he got wings (obvi) and then we split some fries.  Note about their fries. They are massive and DELICIOUS! Definitely split them with a friend. My chicken tenders were really yummy. They were breaded without being so excessively breaded that I wanted to tear the breading off. My bf's wings were really yummy. The next time i went was to pop in for some dessert for my birthday. They have an in house pastry chef. My god. We split an apple turnover with homemade ice cream. It was so good. They also have a build your own funnel cake.   Both times that we went we sat at the bar.  Service was fast and the bartenders are super nice. If they don't know an answer to your question, they actually ask and get back to you. The place isn't massive, but it's a good size that you could take a big group of friends to watch a game. As far as bottle selection. It's not too shabby. I have to keep in mind that it's not like House of 1000 beers. LOL  I really like Coach's. I will definitely be back!   OH! One more thing! They have taco night with a taco and corona special! Do it!"}
{"text":"The waitress was fantastic but that is where it stopped. The menu has completely changed leaving almost no options for another member of our group who is a vegetarian. I ordered the Rachel which came out luke warm, without coleslaw on it, and was just a grilled turkey breast with cheese. The turkey was as tough as jerky. Sent it back and ordered a Rueben to replace it. Reuben took 20 minutes to come out after everyone else had finished their meals. Upon speaking to the manager he had a very unprofessional demeanor and acted as if he was annoyed that we bothered him from his post next to the bar. Offered to take the sandwich off the bill but with an attitude. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"\"Put me in coach, I'm ready to play...today...\"  I had to go and quote John Fogerty, now didn't I?  Obvious sports and classic rock references aside, Kay and I had a grand slam of a lunch here recently.   Occupying the former spot of the late, lamented Whiskey Hollow Grill, Coach's interiors are sparse, achromatic. For a sports-themed establishment on a Sunday afternoon, the ambience was rather low-key despite there being a ballgame on the telly. Our Pittsburgh Pirates were in the midst of a rally as we dined.  A lively, lovely, and agile server by the name of Dani brought to us a buttery bunch of their patented Pub Pretzels for our first inning. These toasted, crispy, chewy, gorgeous billyclubs of dough and salt glistened in the light, putting stadium pretzels on the bench. A creamy and potent  Yuengling beer cheese accompanied the batons, making them as worthy of fame as their menu claims them to be.   Next at bat was an easily appetizing bowl of \"Chef Ed's Famous She-Crab Soup.\" Smooth and luscious like the best chowders, it maintained a richness without smothering the natural flavors of the abundant crabmeat.   A first-class, \"O\"-league pile of \"seasoned salt fries\" that were most likely battered due to their brittle properties seconded a burger called simply \"The Coach.\"  Lettuce, tomato, a magnificently moist and honeyed pulled pork, a milky/crunch-a-rific cole slaw, and an onion ring topped an ideal medium-rare patty of sultry ground chuck in a bun of Italian bread. It was the equivalent of Andrew McCutchen making a 9th inning moon shot with the bases loaded while down by 3 runs.   A wedge of dense, candy-studded, salty-vs-sugary Toffee Cheesecake ended the game with an already padded lead.   While I may miss the Whiskey Hollow Grill, I've found that Coach's is worth rooting for. Jump on the bandwagon with me."}
{"text":"Coach's is your typical sports bar.  Lots of big screen TV's, very open area in stark black and white walls.  Just your typical sports bar menu with reasonable prices.  About ten beers on draft, looked like about the same number of beers by the bottle.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries were good.     Service was friendly.  Had a new waitress that did a good job but you could tell she was learning the operations and was getting info from the other waitress."}
{"text":"We tried eating here before and were disappointed (that was about a year ago and I forget what we even ordered). But we decided to give it another try. We ordered a fish sandwich with a side of \"vegetables\" (side options were very limited--fries, soup, and vegetables). I'll let these pictures below of what they are passing off as a side of veggies speak for themselves (this is right after popping the lid off the cup). After eating some of the \"veggies\" look at the oil/drippings at the bottom of the cup. The fish was adequate at best but you could get the same thing at Eat n Park down the road and have better side options. My husband says Kuhn's fish sandwich is much better, but their hot food section was closed. Also, a small styrofoam cup of pop was $2.75."}
{"text":"The food was good but our waitress was Leah and was terrible! We had to get another waitress to find her 3 times.  We had to go up to the bar to get our own drinks because she was talking to her friends who came in to eat.  If you go make sure your server isn't Leah."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times, and for the most part I like the place.  They have a solid beer selection, and a solid menu.  Last time in I got the beer cheese burger, and while the burger was cooked to my liking (medium) and the taste of the beer cheese was very good, it simply was lacking in quantity.  When I think of a burger named the beer cheese burger I think of a burger smothered in this stuff, not just a light coating of it.  The only two real drawbacks I see with the place, and food isn't one of them despite the underwhelming amount of beer cheese, is that it is always hot in the place, and they play the music way too loud.  I get that on Friday and Saturday nights if the place is packed with the evening bar crowd having the music up, but Thursday at 5:00 with ten people in the joint you don't need to have the stereo cranked all the way up.  Also, I should point out, I have always received fantastic service from the waitresses...  Good local spot that really won't disappoint..."}
{"text":"When you think about it, this is every sports bar in the city, or state. Maybe even the country. It's divey, it's sporty, it's an old man bar, it's where guys come without the wives to get away, it's loud, and it has an okay menu.   This place has that sports bar menu, with wings, burgers, fries, sandwiches, steaks, and some pretty decent daily specials. I had a vegetarian \"grilled cheese\" which disappointingly was more like a quesadilla rather than the grilled cheese it was advertised as. Strike one (well this is a sports bar). Strike two? I I ordered a Diet Pepsi as a drink. The DP tasted like it was made with really bad water! No filtration system? Terrible! Back to the quesadilla, er, grilled cheese, er, screw it, this was a quesadilla. It was hard to find the advertised veggies. Very little spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and I never even saw the roasted red peppers. So, being a sports bar I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the food was sub par, and falsely advertised as a grilled cheese (you have to know when your mind is set for a grilled cheese, nothing else will do!). Oh, and strike three was when someone put money in the jukebox, the sound overrides the advertised big screens all over the bar area so whatever sports is on, you can't listen to the announcers. Big time disappointing place."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to Coaches because they always have had a good atmosphere and great weekly specials. Recently thought, the quality of the food has gone way down; from decent bar fair to middle school cafeteria.   I used to love to order their flatbreads, but they changed the dish from deliciously crisp with awesome toppings to a cold pita-like bread with half melted cheese and some stuff thrown on top.   Otherwise, great place to watch a pens game and really great wait staff"}
{"text":"The quesadillas are so good. Large portion,  fresh,  and cheesy. It's my go to here. Super happy hour appetizer specials. Great beer selection!"}
