{"text":"Came here during lunch hours with a friend one day and both of us got the Waffle Special. There were about 2 or 3 other tables  FOOD - Waffle Special (each includes a waffle topped with strawberry coulis, icing sugar and whipped cream, also includes a plate with 2 pieces each of bacon, sausage, and eggs + side of home fries)  - I forget how much exactly it was but I think it was about $9 which is really reasonable considering the amount of food that you get.  - Food was A-OK, waffle was fluffy and warm.  SERVICE - All food came out at the same time except for one waffle, which took an extra 10 minutes (and didn't even come with icing sugar and whipped cream!)  - Waitress was mediocre but nice enough. She did not smile and left the bill early and told us it was the end of her shift.   ATMOSPHERE/LOCATION/MISC - Medium-sized, large windows at the front that let in sunlight - Located in the Metro plaza, beside Mandarin - CP24 was on which I liked"}
{"text":"Came here back in the winter, and service was terrible.  The lady was not happy at all, and had no energy.  You ask for some more coffee or peanut butter, and the waitress gives you the most unwelcoming glare ever.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Only been here once but it was an amazing experience, the servers were incredibly friendly and the portions were fairly big! The only complain was that the wait for my food was kind of long but other then that I recommend."}
{"text":"Eggs 4 life looks small from the outside but it's got a lot of space actually. Full booths and large tables.   There is a warm, homey vibe here. You know that friend you had in high school who's mom had decorated her kitchen with roosters and chickens everywhere. Thats what this place feels like. It's a good thing.   Service was very kind and friendly. Quick to serve us and help us out, even with a full house on Sunday morning.   I can't speak for the whole menu but I know I could make a better tasting omelet at home. Pretty standard breakfast dishes on the menu. Nothing special in terms of taste buds. Just cheap and cheerful. Nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I actually came here for a late lunch one day, and having skipped breakfast, went for a burger which I thought would be hearty and filling. I got it in a takeout box and it may be partly attributed to that but the entire bottom bun was a soggy mess, as a result of the steam, and the fact that they plated it with the tomatoes on the bun being weighed down by everything else. Burger patty was decently thick, but definetly frozen, like one of those angus frozen patties that kinda looks like flowers. I was really disappointed with the toppings actually; the menu description says it comes with green pepper and bacon. Neither of those were in the burger. Fries were quite soggy and VERY golden in color but I like them that way so I can't really complain. All in all, it was an okay meal but it's only service was to fill me up."}
{"text":"Came here around 11a in a Wednesday.   Good is okay, service is okay. Not bad and not great. We were the only ones at the restaurant at the time (others trickled in close to noon).   I'd go here again if I was in the area but nothing to drive out of your way for."}
{"text":"I like to give smaller places a chance over the big franchises. So when looking for a brunch place and having the option between Cora and Egg4Life, I chose the latter. Service is awful. Food mediocre. Prices ok. You'll be much better off going to Cora or something similar. Must not be the greatest but you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Date ; Sat. June 03, 2017 at 11am Ambience : diner style, not too big but very bright and  homey , the  roaster statues  on the wall give a warm felling to it. Food : famous for their breakfast and the menu has something for whole family. They make home fries there ( not frozen in package ), Poached eggs are their signature food, the omelets are not too greasy, waffles  and pancakes are done very fine , service : fast, friendly and non-stop coffee refill, ( thanks to our server Mitchell ) Price : reasonable. Recommend for Fathers day , family out breakfast  ( June 18, 2017)"}
{"text":"Food: good Service: average  Came here on a Monday. Cozy place, had breakfast and studied."}
{"text":"The food was average at best. Ordered a pancake special. Bacon and breakfast sausages were both over done and very dried. Asked for medium done poach eggs, one was too soft, one has a broken yolk, one was over cooked. Coffee was decent with refills. Service was slow, one server and one in the kitchen 5 tables occupied at the time. Server yelled from the inside telling me to sit anywhere, perhaps they should take down the \"wait to be seated\" sign. Asked for a napkin and the server goes ahead and grab a towel to clean a table right in front of me, then proceeds to where the towel was for my napkins. There are definitely better options with same price."}
{"text":"I've been to this plaza so many times, and glanced past this restaurant. I love breakfast food. This was a solid 3.5/5  Walked in here on a weekday for some breakfast and it was great. Walked in and was told to sit anywhere. Yes to a booth.  Spacious, with booths and tables in a neat, clean set up. Nice spiced homefries!  Only con was the service was a tad slow!  The food was great I got fluffy huge pancakes with eggs and homefries. It was great!   Tasted amazing. Polite waitress.  Will come here from now onwards- never again will I go to Markham station."}
{"text":"This is yet another all-day breakfast restaurant, but since there aren't all that many in East Markham, this is a useful addition.  I had the waffles, eggs, and bacon. The prices are decent and the food is pretty average for this kind of place. The portions are big, but not disgustingly big like at somewhere like Denny's.   The atmosphere inside is your typical chain dinner type of feel, and the service was attentive.  All in all, if you want a basic breakfast at an affordable price, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday morning at 10am for breakfast with a friend. Seated right away and got drinks pretty quickly. Server was attentive and kept checking in on us. I got the pancake special and subbed the bacon + sausage for a fruit bowl. It came with 2 eggs,  2 slices of toast, hash browns and 2 large pancakes. Pancakes were slightly too well done but hashbrowns were delicious! Large portions as well. Cute place, will visit again!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning for breakfast and was pretty busy.  This was our second time here.  Food with good and plentiful, but nothing special.  Service was also great.  I had the pancake special that spread across 3 plates for 9.49 which consists of 2 giant pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage links, home fries and 2 pieces of toast.  My husband had the veggie omelet.  It was way more than enough food."}
{"text":"Did not know about this place. I'm a huge breakfast guy and this place was awesome! I love the atmosphere - the place is not that big, which made it that much cozier. The staff were friendly and very accommodating. The food was fresh, not overcooked nor was it undercooked. Overall everything was good, except my sausages (I'm picky like that). The sausages, however, weren't cooked to my liking. I like my breakfast sausages slightly crispy but the sausages here were soft and blah..  :( tears! LOL"}
{"text":"Average. Food was average, the home fries were sort of soggy, the omlette was the best part. Everything else was mediocre.  The service on the other hand, was decent. The server came to check up on us once in a while, asking if there's anything we needed and was polite."}
{"text":"Love it. I had to go back on Sunday morning since I hand't visited in a while. I marvel at Cathy's capability of staying cool under pressure and her ever changing hairdos. The basic food groups are well represented and consistently fresh including the local gossip. Prices are reasonable, the seating is comfortable and the coffee is just amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   Great place for breakfast.  Fast friendly service.  Been here lots and lots of times and never had a bad meal or service.     My favourite is the Western Omelet and my wife has poached eggs.  Always good.  Waitresses are attentive and refill your coffee.     Sometimes busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been having breakfast here since we moved in the area. We usually come in around 8am after our shift so there's not a lot of people. service is okay, free coffee refills. we always order the early bird special, 2 eggs 3 slices of bacon, home fries and toast for 4.99. it's pretty cheap, it taste good as well. the bacon and sausage is not that greasy. the home fries is also great but the serving is not so great. overall, I highly recommend this place. pretty cozy and laid back."}
{"text":"Run of the mill breakfast joint. Menu looked good but the food was meh at best. Service was slightly lower than average and the price was average. Our waitress messed up about 8 times but I think she was new so no hard feelings. All in all, for bang for buck, and for quality, you're better off at halibut house."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow for three waitresses taking care of about 12 tables. There were lots of uncleared tables the whole time we were there. Took a while to get our menus and take our orders but they were pleasant.   Food is mediocre. It almost feels like something you can make at home. The presentation is alright. Prices are fair, cheaper than Cora's by a couple bucks. Coffee is meh.   Eggs and home fries are cooked well, bacon not too greasy. We ordered the waffles as well but those were last on our list. The batter isn't sweet or eggy enough so the waffles came out dry and tasteless. There were some fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream on the side which was nice.   Honestly, they'd be worth it for the early bird specials but I'm not sure if I'd come after 10am."}
{"text":"We are regulars in this place, but were extremely disappointed during our last visit. From the time we were seated everything started going wrong. We ordered coffees and we had to ask our server for the milk/cream 3 times. By the time she brought it in, the coffee was already lukewarm. Then our order of ham came in and her fingers were touching a part of the eggs on the edge of the plate, same thing for the pancakes. We had to ask her for catsup twice. We were still in the middle of eating and she brought in the bill. Then I asked for a take out box and she kept forgetting, I had to ask her for the 2nd time. Lastly, when we looked at the bill, my son's order of chicken fingers includes the chocolate milk in the price, but she added it separately, adding almost $3 on top of the bill. I had to tell her and as expected, she said she forgot. Her name is Collien as I got it from the receipt. Servers should continuosly be supervised"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place if you looking for breakfast type food. The place is very open with many seats.   Got the Jessie Eggs Benedict $12.99 - comes with three poached eggs which was served on top of fresh spinach and muffin bread. The hollandaise sauce went well with everything and there was a healthy portion of smoked salmon.  Pancake special $10.49 - comes with 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 slices of bacon and 2 sausage. Everything tasted pretty decent. No complaints.  Both meals come with home fries.  It was not busy on a Friday morning so service was excellent."}
{"text":"It's a little expensive.  It's a little not as good as I'd have made for myself.  But it's the burbs, and it's a great place to meet with friends.  Now - you have to appreciate I come from a line of people who like there eggs done in a specific way - in fact, when my father was my age he once burst into the kitchen of a restaurant and demanded he be allowed to cook his eggs himself, because they screwed them up the last time.  The seventies - what a different time to be alive."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place over all, and provides an alternative to Cora's at a lower price point. They have fantastic waffles.   Recently we have noticed the service slipping. We would order our tea/coffee whatever, and the wrong items would come out. This has happened more than once.   Potatoes could be more flavourful."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. They have completely messed up my order the 2 times I have been here. They also always seem to leave out a lot of food that comes with the meal. Maybe they are trying to save money and hoping you won't realize half your meal is missing. AVOID!!"}
{"text":"Large portion of great food and amazing price ! You gotta come try it's great place. We ordered one Benny and $5.99 for six of a choice of pancake /waffle / French toast we got French toast it was SOOO good and can't find anywhere else at that price"}
{"text":"So currently I have this phase where I am searching for awesome breakfast places. So far, I keep ordering the same thing...eggs, sausage, homefries, toast, and Pancakes but I don't think I'm going to get sick of it any time soon- Im just lovin' breakfast foods right now. Anyways, I came here after someone suggested it. I drive by the plaza every day so I was definitely surprised that I didn't notice Eggs 4 life. Its a pleasant surprise though because I'm running out of places whose breakfast I can try!   So now that you know what I always order, I can dive straight into the food. The breakfast was very average. Nothing on the plate stoodout. Actually, the pancakes stood out but not for a good reason. They were incredibly dry! I was surpised but as I was cutting into them they were crumbling to some degree. Needless to say, I was not impressed by the breakfast.   Folks, if you value the moistness of your pancakes, save yourself the disappointment and don't get them from here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to take me to a breakfast place on Sunday morning so he took me here. I always seen this place when I'm driving to Wal-mart but never was interested in eating here ever.   When we walked in, the place was super packed. My boyfriend said he loves getting their eggs Benedict so I got the same thing. The only other place that I have tried eggs Benedict was at pickle barrel and it was A O-K so I was super surprised at how amazing these eggs Benedict was. It was  three poached eggs on top of peameal and english muffin. I had never tasted anything so heavenly as this eggs Benedict. It was just so delicious. The sauce was amazing.   The server was very friendly and touchy. Was constantly checking up on us and didn't laugh at me when I didn't know how I wanted my eggs. Every restaurant is different and I'm so used to saying over easy at Daybreak that my boyfriend was laughing at me when I said it. =/   Overall, I would definitely come back here for just the eggs benedict because it was so ^#(@&#&@*( amazing.   Happy Eating fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"it's a very diner type setting and feel to it. you're not gonna expect or get gourmet. with that being said, if you want a good sized egg benny breakfast that's gonna fill you up, eggs 4 life will do the trick.  i wanted to try the avocado benny, but i decided to go for the steak. you can choose how you want your poached eggs. hard medium or soft. maybe it's just me, but i haven't been asked that before. i thought it was pretty cool. i ordered my steak rare. though it came medium well. I live nearby, so i'll probably still be coming by from time to time when i get breakfast cravings since i don't really wanna go to cora's or eggsmart. I am yours to lose, Eggs 4 Life."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like some breakfast served anytime?  I went here with a friend on a late afternoon after we decided that we better grab a bite to eat before continuing on with the day.  We decided what we wanted to eat within minutes. I wanted the Eggs Benedict! My friend wanted the Hercules omelette. We waited... Each went to the bathroom to wash our hands since we had just arrived from riding at the barn.. We waited.. We chatted, looked around... waited. Finally we saw a waitress and flagged her down. We ordered our food and orange juice. The orange juice arrived quickly. I chugged the glass down in about ten seconds(must have been dehydrated from riding for most of the morning... riding horses people). We waited and finally our food arrived. Plus I asked for a second glass of orange juice after we flagged the waitress down again.  The Eggs Benedict was standard nothing special so it hit the spot. My friend said that she really enjoyed her omelette. So it was OK.  It cost about $30.00 and that was fine too considering I probably chugged a few glasses of fresh OJ.   So why the 3 star rating? The service sucked. From arrival time to \"check please\" we had to flag the waitress down. To be fair.. it was possible that they were short staffed. I will attend again as our meal was typical breakfast nothing special."}
{"text":"Every neighbourhood needs a small family style breakfast joint.   Egg 4 Life is the one for Boxgrove's neighbourhood.   Open 7 days a week from 7:00 AM!! Some poor soul like me needs to go to work Saturday mornings and just want some home style breakfast..   3 Fried Eggs Over Easy with Toast and Home Fries ($4.49) really hit the spot and tie me over till lunch time.   Free WIFI... Yes that's what I like!   CP24 is on..Yes that's what some people like!  Save your reciepts as 6 of those will redeem a free $4.99 entree... So buy 6 get 1 FREE!"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast fanatic, and this place is my favourite in Markham. I love eggs benedict and E4L gets it right every time. My favourite here is california eggs benny. Service has always been good too."}
{"text":"Excellent place and excellent service - I love the interior decor. Attached photo of a (spinach and cheese) omelette with home fries and toast. Highly recommend this place for families! Excellent omelette!"}
