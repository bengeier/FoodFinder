{"text":"I try to support local businesses, but this is by far the worst pizza I have had. $25 for what would be a typical combination pizza (Villa Special). The crust is cardboard and bland, and the onions and bell peppers might as well be raw. This was the Villa on Boulder, not Stephanie. Boxers or Johnny Macs is way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Welcome to the only restaurant in the state of AZ that doesn't allow a patron a glass of water with their meal when requested.   \"We only have bottled water\" I was told. Nice scambo guys. It backfired here this time though.  I left the slice that the cook prepared for me there and found another place to spend my money.   Out of principle, I think I'd stay away from these goofs. They don't deserve your hard earned money.  To further end, I think its the law in Arizona that an establishment must give you a glass of water when asked even if you're not buying anything.  That's part of owning a restaurant in the desert...especially in July.  The manager who instructed employees to do this should be fired.  No questions asked, do not pass go, do not collect $200.   And the young girl with braces who shared this policy with me in such a smug and irreverent manner should be let go too until she learns to question the integrity of a directive.  Would she also \"short change a customer\" if she'd been instructed to?  Would she do it with the same arrogant demeanor and panache?  I worry that she might.  She didn't flinch when I took my business elsewhere.  She knew beyond question that she was far better than me.  And I shutter to think of the message it sends.  They don't have tap water back there?  How the heck do they wash all of the equipment and utensils when making the food they are serving.  Obviously they didn't think through that response too well???  Look at the bad P.R. you just received for thinking its clever to refuse a paying customer a cup of water in hopes of getting them to pay $2.49 for a .20 cent bottle.  I'd be willing to bet that either you'll have changed this ludicrous policy by the next time I stop next door to get barbecue, tacos or a pretzel OR you'll be closing up shop shortly thereafter.  You guys don't deserve to have my business.  Nor anybody I can share this story with."}
{"text":"Hmmm, love Villa Pizza!  However, this location on Stephanie is the BEST one out them all!  I have never been disappointed!  For a pizza joint close to me, I am very happy to go there :)"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick bite, but the sides are always dry and nasty looking! I've had the Stromboli and the Stuffed pizza. Pretty decent if its semi fresh but this place is King of the Heat Lamps!   Need a quick bite of Italian? Don't expect 5 stars, but at least you'll be full right?  I'd like to give a 1 star for the Mac & Cheese. Or if there was an option for a -5 stars, that dish would take the cake.   But the pepperoni is good, and the marinara sauce isn't terrible.   Do I have you convinced yet?   Oh good, me either.   Decent. Quick, with a few good options."}
{"text":"This place does not give mall employee discounts anymore (sad) The only place at the PV mall that has decent food.  The manager Ed is very friendly and provides great customer service.  My usual is baked ziti w/ extra marinara sauce. Sauteed vegetables are a good side dish to have.  Ed gave me a free soda for being a loyal customer.  Try Sierra Mist with mango flavoring. Really yummy.  I would def. go back often. Partly cuz all other places in the food court kinda suck, but also cuz I get treated well. If I ever feel like ordering pizza for my associates at my store, I know where to order from."}
{"text":"Pizza might be good if it was hot. I have tried to eat this place on numerous occasions and the pizza is never heated through. Real bummer as I think it may be good if heated properly."}
{"text":"Greatest pizza in henderson. Consistant quality and friendly service. The owners really try to do the best job and the new place is geat!"}
{"text":"In Southwest terminal near (if I remember correctly) Gate C22.  They had a triple play deal for $8.99 where you can choose a pasta, a salad, and either chicken parmigiana or sausage with peppers (there might have been another entree option).  I chose the baked ziti as the pasta and found it delicious.  I also chose the chicken parmigiana.  The girl cashier was very nice and the portion was very good. It also came with bread.   I was pleased and full by the time I was finished.  I would eat there again.  I walked around to see what nearby eateries were charging and was glad I went with this place."}
{"text":"two things, I judge a pizza company by their anchovy 'za and their ease of ordering... first of all, their web site is some corporate variety, slinging franchise opportunities versus providing those 2 pizza coupon specials one of the other reviews talked about.   so 2.   Not one star because the cheese slices are just ok, but what ever."}
{"text":"Just the worst! In a bind because a two year old neeeeeeded some pizza stat! $4.41 for a tiny slice of terrible pepperoni pizza! WTF. You would have a better experience if you literally ate the money you would have spent. Seriously. Garbage. I can't even handle this. I've had better freezer burned pizza for a dollar of managers special frozen pizza from the grocery store.   The staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I don't know how I feel about this place.  I've eaten here a few times because my brother is a fan of pizza and he seems to like it.  However, me being the picky Italian that I am, have noticed that this place is really, really inconsistent when it comes to their food, and I'm getting sick of it.  There are times that I go when the pizza is good (i.e., the toppings taste good, the pizza is thin and crunchy), but there are other times when I go and the pizza is terrible (the crust is way too thick, the toppings seem undercooked, and the pizza is just bland).  I feel like the pizza I get depends on the day I go, and it's a crap shoot every time I go there.  I've concluded that either the pizza maker is schizophrenic or he just doesn't know what the hell he's doing.    Oh, circa 1995-2000 Villa Pizza.  How I miss thee.  I don't know what's up with these franchises, but they just aren't working for me."}
{"text":"my daughter opted for a slice of plain pizza. it was not hot at all, as i felt the plate it was put on so i went back before she ate it and asked the employee if he could heat it up...well he seemed irritated about me tellng him it was not hot. he looked at me a second and told me it was \"just made\". i'm sorry? bull!!!  i paid for something that was not up to standard and you're going to lie and give me an attitude? so he gave me a new slice and after biting into it, my daughter said it was STILL cold, not good at all! what kid doesn't love pizza?! i wouldnt recommend anyone eat here. saving grace for me was that my iced tea was okay"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been driving from Sunrise Mnt. To get pizza from Villa for years following from the old location to the new one. We took a drive today and to our disappointment it was closed and out of business. We would really like to know what happened."}
{"text":"I love this place! The people there are always so nice and my pizza is always perfect! Me and my bf love the Italian Garlic pizza. I like it without veggies and even ordered it half with and half without and it was perfect! I'm sorry, but this place is just too yummy. I loves it!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I went to Villas to get the twice as nice deal. Since we were sharing we wanted to split the bill. Oddly the cashier over complicated it and made it difficult to split the bill. When we payed she got the math wrong then my cousin and I had to rearrange the money given back. After we ate I went to get a refill and I requested to get a refill of Pepsi with no ice. The cashier then rolled her eyes and put in ice anyway. Although the pizza was okay, villas earns only 1 star due to very rude staff."}
{"text":"Went in not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised!!!!  The owner was friendly and pleasant:)  There were over 5 types available and it was all tasty and fresh.   My 3 year old daughter ate one piece and he didn't even charge us. That was sweet."}
{"text":"I would have loved to try the pizza.  The guy saw me there waiting at the counter to take my order but made me wait a few minutes and never acknowledged me, or took my order.  Empty restaurant....not as if they were busy."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, the menu was very unclear on pricing. Ended up spending $22.00 for one meal and a side salad and one drink. The food wasn't too bad, but honestly Dominoes would have been better."}
{"text":"Overall assessment:  Gotcha pricing leaves a bad taste  Last night was the first time I ordered pizza from Villa Pizza, and I made the mistake of not having a menu in my possession when ordering.  We ordered two large pizzas (one cheese and one with mushrooms), and it was $34.  There was a menu taped to one of the boxes, and the menu said that if we had mentioned their \"two pizza special\" when ordering, I would have saved $8.  The person on the phone should have mentioned that there was a special.   Boy do I feel ripped off.   While the pizza was good, the gotcha pricing left a bad taste.  More than anything, yelpers need to be aware."}
{"text":"This place only gets 3 stars for their amazing ziti... I've eaten here several times in all the years I been coming to this mall and while the staff has always been nice and courteous the pizza is bland and greasy as all get out and the salad has very poor lettuce   If Italian is your thing there's a California pizza kitchen here that is much better quality food and after your charmin bill you'll encounter from the grocery store from villa it will come to the same price"}
{"text":"Pizza was terrible and I was hungry.  Notch or two below sbarros.   Most of the food at this food court was not good."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever yeech! Gotta also love being overcharged, yay!"}
{"text":"Worse service...worker got mad at me when she thought I ordered something else and gave all kinds of attitude.  Customer service matters a lot and this place is lacking (well at least the one employee).  I asked for managements number and when I called they said manager wasn't there and to call back.  Unbelievable. Not good for the airport to leave customers with this type of service"}
{"text":"Pretty flavorless... Barely warm, $15 for Stromboli combo.. Most confusing ordering process ever. The lady kept barking at me to choose a side but it doesn't say anywhere what the sides are.. Keep walking"}
{"text":"Pretty sad pizza place.  Counter person was so cold he was almost rude, pizza was horrible, Mac and Cheese was sad.  Won't go there again. Only reason it wasn't 1 star, low expectations going in.  And still it was a fail.  Should have gone to Feast buffet"}
{"text":"Was here for an event that had approximately 20 people in attendance.  This pretty much filled up the little dining space inside VP.  I ordered up a white pizza that was very dry.  They crust was of a cardboard nature and required a lot of ranch to put down.    The soda fountain is accessible to the public, but they don't want you filling your cup yourself.  It's east of Boulder Highway so that and the nothing to Yelp about quality/price of the pizza is cause for me not to return."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Didn't get to try the food. When my turn came up in line, the woman at the register ignored me and  walked away, just to wander around doing nothing. After a minute, she looked at me from across the room and yelled out to me to give her my order. All I wanted was a salad with no cheese, but she told me to go a few gates down to get that, because their salads were pre-made, even though I could see them in the back making salads.  Clearly they did not want my business so they won't get it."}
{"text":"Just all right.  2 slices of paper thin cheese pizza and a drink for $6.50.  I've had better.  Napoli Pizza, for one, seems to carry a better value for the money."}
{"text":"I've had better pizza in airports.  The sauce is too sweet and crust not crisp enough.  Pass!"}
{"text":"Nice pizza place. I would go there if i was looking for a cheap meal and want to eat a nice slice of pizza. Tastes good and price is good."}
{"text":"Sausage pepperoni Pizza was surprisingly good as was the Stromboli.  I would seek it out again for sure"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get pizza in all of Henderson. It does cost more than the regular pizza joint, but they use all fresh ingredients. We always get the extra large pizza and mild chicken fingers. We have never had any problems or issues with the food here. It is a family owned business and the owners are always at there and so very friendly!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the negativity in the other remarks but I thought their pies were as authentic as I remember from back in the day when pizza was made by 'real Italian chefs' and tasted like New York Pizza! ...as only a pizza should! They advertise the real deal and it came up to my expectations. It was fresh and clearly made from fresh ingredients and not just pre-made, pop-in-to-warm-up types as I have experienced in other pizzerias. The veggie pizza was packed-full of freshly chopped veggies. I was totally impressed."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate pizza here when we were at SouthPark Mall this past weekend. I'd never eaten here so had questions for the workers, which they answered. They were nice enough, but tried to charge us for a soft drink we didn't get. The pricing was a bit confusing and I'm still convinced we were overcharged.   I had a Greek stromboli and a Greek salad and thought it was okay- the marinara sauce for the stromboli was super thin, but the stromboli itself was fine with a nice blend of cheese, spinach, and tomatoes. Not that I had high expectations for mall food. I did like that you could get a salad on the side.   My husband wasn't very happy with his pizza. It was super thick crusted with very little toppings, and when he got it, it was still cold. He took it back and they re-heated it in the oven, but he still didn't like it very much.   Basically... it's mall food court pizza. If you really want good pizza, you don't go to the mall food court. If you're already there and want Italian food, you might be okay eating here but if you're craving pizza, I would skip it and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't get the spinach Stromboli. Tasted like dirt and weeds. The marinara \"sauce\" was just red liquid. Terrible terrible terrible.  The people working didn't really seem invested in anything as well."}
{"text":"Not bad for a place in the airport! Loved their sicilian pizza. Of course they're going to be expensive! What do you expect from airport food XD. They a multitude of other italian/pasta dishes that I didn't get to try out, but I can certainly vouch for their pizza! They are located next to C24 in the Southwest terminal in a mini food court with the popeyes and Wendy's. Some place to sit, but not a whole lot."}
{"text":"Plain and simple...You get what you pay for. Small local family run business.They do a GREAT pizza buffet during lunch (worth wayyy more than what you pay). I always take family and friends there when they come from out of town. NOT the same as any other Villa. Nice seating area inside with a relaxed atmosphere.   Highly recommended!    Also- to comment on other reviews: - the guy with the 3 fingers probably had the lunch special which would've came with a drink and if you took it back to the office there was probably a packaging fee for lunch specials to go. They don't offer that anymore b/c they have the pizza buffet.  - to the girl (Becky) who was a customer for 14  years and had 1 bad experience with chicken fingers...it's funny how you didn't make one good review over the 14 years you were \"satisfied\". Unfortunately this is one of the problems with Yelp."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  We grabbed a bite to eat before catching a movie at Green Valley Ranch. Villa Pizza is located inside the food court upstairs just off the casino floor.  For what it is, I liked it. Pizza-a-plenty with large, oversized slices. The prices are about on par with what you would expect in a food court at a casino, so no suprise there.  Nothing gourmet about it, but is that really what you were expecting? The workers working there yesterday were friendly and patient with us while we decided, which was appreciated. You get a couple of large slices and a couple of drinks for less than 10.00. What do you want?  I liked it and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.. Granted it's airport food, I didn't expect much. That's is just what I got pizza so greasy, it was impossible to stomach. After requesting a new pizza, the cashier was the rudest person I have ever met. Who treats customers like this ? After waiting 15 mins to remake a new one still not ready. I requested my money back, only to be harassed once more by the rude employee.. NEVER GO HERE."}
{"text":"Thanks for giving me pizza so old the cheese is no longer melted. You would think they could at least heat it. Oh I know because the bottom was already burned.They heated it slightly.  Hope I don't get sick"}
{"text":"I have only eaten here twice, that said both times were just for slices which seems to be a hard thing to find in the valley.  Well they have a very competent slice, it would be  a slice I would expect to find in a northern NJ suburb.  It is not a New York slice but close, oh so close.  I want to say 31/2 stars but I am not able so upped it half."}
{"text":"I was flying out of MC Carran today and needed to grab a bite to eat. So I perused the restaurants in the Gate areas and spotted out Villa Pizza . So I perused their menu and ordered the Lasagna , Pasta Salad and mixed vegetables. It was Filling but Good in taste. Not bad for Airport food."}
{"text":"Blah.  Reheated cardboard with cheese."}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch pizza buffet. I'd give this place two and a half stars. The quality of the pizza was good, but not a lot of selection. The salad bar offered two types of dressing, and toppings included diced tomatoes, green peppers, onions, and croutons which were stale.  The main reason for the poor review though is the owners. They did not seem inviting or welcoming at all. Each time I went back for more pizza or soda, I could feel them watching me like a hawk. I felt like I was doing something wrong each time I went back. I can safely say I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"It's OK. Here's a quick tip, if you want pizza, keep walking toward C12ish there is a sabarro... Go there."}
{"text":"I had the Greek Stromboli--which was surprisingly good! The marinara dipping sauce was a bit raw tasting, but overall the food was good. They were out of the chicken panini--even though they had one on display, and there was also food in a steam table (noodles, meatballs, sauce, and mac n'cheese) that wasn't on the menu--which I found strange. But I can recommend the Greek Stromboli (spinach, tomato, feta)."}
{"text":"Villa offers a thin NY style pizza. I never tried any of their specialties. I perfer to stay with cheese pizza. The pizza is almost always greasey and chewy but i go every once in awhile just for that pizza to go along with my beer."}
{"text":"Has the pizza.  Pre-made so it was quick but also tasted like it was pre-made.  Good for a quick bite but would never go there if outside of an airport."}
{"text":"I agree with the other review here. This place sucks. They had the absolute worst, tiny dried out things they pass off as fingers, waaaay over cooked (and I've tried this place more then once, always the same) Horrible bland pizza and not to mentioned waaay over priced. Over $7 for an order of crappy fingers. I called and talked to the manager, he said he'd make it right for me the next time I was in there, gave them my name, etc. So I go in a few weeks later and guess what? He had no idea what I was talking about, said he never said such a thing....That was over 2 years ago and I've not been back since and they will NEVER get a dime from me again"}
{"text":"Tried their 9.99 deal for a large and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever attempted to eat.  They should have paid us to eat this garbage.  Now I'm stuck with 2 inedible large pizzas and have to go somewhere else for more.  Unfortunately 1 star is required.  Definitely a ZERO."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fingers and fries from this joint. The staff was great and thee food came quickly. When I got back to the office to eat it. The chicken fingers were so small I was enraged!!!! 3 lil fingers and a handful of fries for $9. I wont make that mistake again. Some people have stated the pizza is not bad. I may try the pizza buffet just to get my money back. LOL"}
{"text":"My son and I decided to go here after the Anthem Christmas tree lighting; it was well after the crowds had died down. I've been here once before and was not at all impressed so I wasn't expecting too much. Well, it was even worse than the first time! My son, being a kid, opted for a slice of cheese pizza which was still in the oven so at least that was fresh. I opted for some spaghetti.  I watched the server put some noodles into a black plastic bowl and top it off with sauce. I looked away for a second and the bowl was no longer on the counter. We stood there  for a couple minutes, looking at the server and others behind the counter for some sort of a cue to see if we should stay there or move toward the register or something. The next thing I see is our server kneel down and pull my spaghetti out of the abyss. I asked if she had just pulled it out of a microwave and she said yes. I told her I didn't want it then to which she replied \"well, we microwave all of our food\". I guess that explains part of the reason why it tastes so bad! I think almost everyone knows that you DON'T microwave anything in a plastic dish that isn't meant to go in the microwave! Even the ones that are meant to go in the microwave are questionable. If my kid wouldn't have REALLY wanted pizza we wouldn't have bothered to purchase anything from them. Don't waste your money here or risk your health by getting toxins from microwaved plastic!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and the food was good.  We ordered the lasagna dinner.  It was reasonably priced and came with French bread and a small salad.  We also tried their Stromboli...also very good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the new location for Villa last weekend. I had never eaten at the old location, but I had been inside to pick up to-go orders. The new location is certainly an improvement, not that the original was necessarily bad.   While Villa is in a new spot, the food has not changed. Nor have the prices. Our waitress was very attentive, and our order came out quickly."}
{"text":"Had two bad experiences with this particular Villa Pizza...and the problem is always with the skank that answers the phone...had a coupon...she said are you sure it is ours?  when we got there we gave her the money the dummy gave the money back because she can not ring the register....on the Wednesday before we call for a pizza and the same girl (Janeth) answered...it was 8:30 p.m. half our before closing...she said are you sure you got the right place we close at 9...The management really needs to deal with this girl..very poor customer service...losing business because the this idiot..."}
{"text":"What is there to say about a fast food pizza place? It's fine. Villa Pizza is just like Sbarro, you can get pre-made, crappy slices of pizza. You order, they throw it in the oven and warm it over for you. Nothing great but a decent snack if you happen to be in Green Valley Ranch casino. They have some meal deals on their menu board where you can get pasta and a salad for less than $10."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. The pizza looked soooo good but once I took a bite is was the most discusting thing I have ever eaten, the cheese slipped off and I felt the crust that was under the pizza and it was so so so soggy like it was a few days old, then there was a strange film type substance under the cheese. Needless to say I will never be eating at any villa pizza ever again, after I saw that gross pizza I kept thinking about it and felt sick and wanted to vomit!"}
{"text":"This used to be my local Villa pizza. We ordered pizza and either picked up or had delivered about a dozen times when we lived in this neighborhood. The pizza quality was fairly consistent, good ingredients (from the pepperoni to the veggies) and the it was always greasy, and more than once was ordered when we were hungover. We never ate in at this location, and honestly, I never saw anyone in the dining room when I went to pick up. The prices are a little high, and we rarely encountered any specials. We always enjoyed the taste of this nice greasy soggy pizza, but if  that is not what you are looking for, don't do it. The garlic knots and fries are also pretty decent, but again, a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Quick delicious Stromboli for bkft served with friendly service. What a nice experience at the airport."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken ranch Stromboli with broccoli. A bit on the greasy side but tasted fine. Price is $8.99 for the Stromboli.   This Italian eatery is located next to Popye's chicken & biscuits and Wendy's hamburger at the C gates."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Older lady asked what we wanted then immediately turned away and walked to the back. Never came back to help. The guy making the pizzas had to help us. The women at the register had no idea what she was doing..took almost 5 minutes to ring us up. Then after I handed her my card she asked if I wanted it still.  Will never be going there again."}
{"text":"Sad to say that this Villa is terrible.  They apparently do not like honoring the coupons they mail out -- seriously, if you treat your customers like criminals when all they're trying to do is redeem the things you mail out en masse, you're not going to be around long.  We usually get Villa from the store on Durango, but we were on the other side of town visiting friends and this was the closest one.  After this fiasco, we decided to head over to Rocco's instead -- Villa will not get anymore of our business."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. There is an older lady who is just a witch to everyone. Treats customers like they are just bothering her. Fixed the issue walked away and won't eat here."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Villa Pizza for over 14 years. (They recently relocated). The owners have always been nice people and even though the pizza is a little over priced I enjoy it. When you pay  $40 for a large cheese pizza and 15 fingers, you expect them to be good. I've never had an issue until today. I ordered delivery from this Villa (Cheese Pizza and fingers/hot.) It took almost 50 minutes to get here. which was fine...but when it got here the pizza was barely warm and the fingers looked like they had barely drizzled hot sauce on them. Usually they come doused in the sauce and they are hot and fresh. I was really upset considering I also tipped $6 to the driver. Since I've been a patron of theirs for years I decided to call and let them know my dissatisfaction. The owner's wife answered the phone. I explained to her the situation in a calm manner. She said that they took the pizza right out of the oven and delivered it. Which could possibly be true. I am sure they delivered several orders on the way to mine. She also stated that their chicken soaks up the sauce. I've ordered this exact meal several times and never had it in that condition. When I explained it to her, she got flustered and handed the phone to her husband. He then proceeded to yell at me and tell me that I was wrong. I was extremely offended and told him that I have ordered from them for 14 years. He said he would send me a fixed order. I told him it was not necessary but that I just wanted him to acknowledge that it was poor. He said he was sending a fixed order and that I didn't need to order from him ever again.  I was completely offended. I could not believe that after eating there and ordering food to go for over 14 years that I would be treated so poorly. I can honestly say I will never order from them again as I refuse to support any business, small or large that would yell at customers like that. I am afraid to eat what they brought to \"replace\" the order as I fear it could be \"compromised.\" I am so disappointed, to say the least that any business would treat customers that way. I will NEVER eat or order from this Villa Pizza again."}
{"text":"Props for delivering a browning and wilting salad that was also semi-frozen. Have you ever crunched ice crystals in your lettuce? It's pretty disgusting.  $7 down the drain."}
{"text":"Avoid, not worth the $10. Cold and rubbery. At least ask them to open the box before you buy it, and you'll see for yourself. Regretfully I did not. Maybe if you're on the way home and have had some drinks, but in that case, I guess I'm not the target market. (This time around anyway, and now there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"What can you expect from airport food? Granted, they do have a good selection. Prices are high per usual but there is ample seating and they give you ice water instead of redirecting you to a fountain. The food was so-so. But again, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"I'm eating as I type one handed, a slice in the other hand.  Goodness, this pizza is good! I got the two slice 'deal' of cheese.  Delicious pizza, and I think it's worth the price.  I haven't had Villa Pizza in so long since my husband doesn't like them (I have no idea what's wrong with him...I think he has problems.) but I don't care his excuse, this is the new pizza place for me!"}
{"text":"Villa Pizza is one of my least favorite pizza places.  Have I been to Villa several times?  Sure.  Would I go here if I wasn't rushed or absolutely dying for cheap pizza?  Nah.  The crust is a bit cardboard-ish.  The sauce has an okay flavor.  There is really nothing distinctive or interesting about the pizza.  It just... is.  It's a belly-filler and nothing more."}
{"text":"got a slice of heartburn and disappointment at about 9pm.  It took me 15 minutes to get through the line of 4 people, 2 to eat a slice... it was something like food, but it had been sitting out too long.  I think it was mainly that the place was closing down that the food was so bad, but man, it was bad, slow, expensive and not good even by airport standards."}
{"text":"This was just plain bad.  It had a really overly thick crust with a thin layer of cheese and sauce.  It tasted like school lunch pizza from high school in the 80's.  The sausage also tasted cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could. The food wasn't very warm never mind hot. The cashier had no personality and bordered on being rude. When my daughter dropped her soda in front of the cashier while I was paying the cashier charged me for a new one. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Screw this place. I've ordered from them a bunch of times and the food is always \"meh\" at best, but last night I placed an order at 8:30pm and when it hadn't showed up at 10:00pm I called the restaurant and asked when it would be arriving. I spoke to someone on the phone who sounded like a total stoner zombie who did not apologize ONCE for the delay. \"My driver knocked on your door and called three times but you didn't answer.\" He then quoted me back the WRONG apartment number and WRONG phone number, even though I double-checked my order and both were entered correctly online. \"So, what do you want me to do? Your food is sitting right here.\" the idiot said. \"Uh, well, I don't want the food that's been sitting around in a bag for an hour, so I'd like you to re-make my order and send it over, please.\" -- \"Sorry, we can't, we're closed now.\"   Never ordering from these idiots again and you shouldn't either. You're not missing anything, food-wise, and if you're lucky enough to get the same illiterate monkey who took my order, you'll be lucky if you even get your food anyway."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this Villa Since i lived in Las Vegas the 1st time i lived here and could drive. Its the best of all the Villa Pizza's. Whether i eat in or call and pick it up. The pizza is always hot and fresh and tastes the same. Try the Cannolis, and the Zeppolis. Im always proud to pull up and know im about to have a taste of Chewy Big Slices. The Salads are wonderful and fresh as well. Lets just say ive been going here so long they know me and my friends by name. Though im leaving for Denver just like before when i come back to Vegas my family has to take me to Villa. And they love Villa too."}
{"text":"Great airport food. The ordered in wrap was a little soggy so the crew let me Exchange it for some thing else. Stress and drama free! A for that!"}
{"text":"I have 2 girls that attend dance class in the same strip mall that this villa pizza is located, ergo I have been here quite a few times. The service is always fast and friendly. I have ordered the chicken wings, pizza, garlic knots, garlic fries and the salad. I can honestly say that it has always been above average. The garlic knots are my kids favorite. I personally LOVE the wings because they are always crispy and fresh. We often order the wing and pizza special to take to a friends house for potlucks. The ranch dressing here is amazing... we like to order extra because it seems to disappear quickly."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick bite to eat before playing slots. The pizza here is just OK. Nothing too special, then again I usually just get plain cheese pizza.  Besides pizza, they also have pasta and salad which looked okay.  I recommend coming here for something quick and simple before catching a movie downstairs or before you sit at the poker table."}
{"text":"It's not delivery, it's DiGiorno! Seriously, this tastes like bad frozen pizza. Not necessarily bad if it's $1.50 a slice, but for $4.60 a slice it is outrageous."}
{"text":"One star is generous. I am sitting in McDonald's drive through line because I could only make it one bite into my meatball sub before I had to put it down.  The cheese and bread were good. The sauce was good. The meatball tasted like balled up sponge in tomato sauce. It was a little cheat, flavorless but nasty tasting at the same time.   Wife will review her food too, needless to say, they managed to mess up salad too.   We will NOT be going back here."}
{"text":"Food court pizza, it is what it is. In this case, a very light and too fluffy crust that is 3/4 of an inch thick. The mushroom & spinach was probably the best choice.  But it's a food court, so choices are limited."}
{"text":"Had a chicken Caesar wrap. It was made a long time in advance and everything inside tasted like soggy soft tortillas."}
