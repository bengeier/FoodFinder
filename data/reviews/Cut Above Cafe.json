{"text":"This place is great for a quick breakfast or lunch during the work week. The people that run the place are great and are always welcoming, they are half the reason I keep returning to this place. I also like that they have a lot of things to pick up before work like breakfast bars, Boyd's coffee bar, baked goods and energy drinks.   Food is always great here, I love the wraps like the caesar salad wrap in a green tortilla as well as the great daily lunch specials that keep lunch interesting everyday. Breakfast burritos are great as well as the omelets and I love the French Toast when they have it as a breakfast special.  Oh and if you see the lemon brownie squares by the counter, definitely pick one up for a snack later."}
{"text":"The Cut Above Cafe is a great place to go for an affordable lunch. They offer a wide variety of meals that are fresh and made when ordered. The staff is very polite and offers a good experience. Items I would recommend are their sandwiches or daily specials."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Really enjoy the green smoothies in the morning and the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich for lunch. Great organic coffee as well. Nice little corporate cafe!"}
{"text":"Very clean, very nice staff. Healthy breakfast burrito is great. One of the cleanest restaurants around."}
{"text":"I had zero issues with cut above cafe back when Wes was the manager. A couple weeks ago I ordered a bacon turkey avocado. They got my order wrong and served me a blt with avocado added for a charge. Figured it was just a screw up. Whatever. Then I went here today and was served a sandwich with moldy bread. Sigh."}
{"text":"I work across the street and this little hidden gem is the best! It's inexpensive (well by downtown standards) and the quality is great!  I get their BLT on sourdough toasted - Huge slabs of bacon, bread toasted perfectly. All the contents in this sandwich are perfectly proportioned (add hotsauce)  Pasta salad - nothing too special but it's still delicious. It's an antipasto salad with th right about of meat.  Get their breakfast sandwich on a croissant. It's the perfect thing to start the morning with.   Whatever they have on special is always delicious. I've had their gourmet nachos, buffalo sandwich and roasted vegetable quesadilla.  They also have snacks (i.e. chips, granola bars, candy, pretzel and cheese).   It's the perfect little spot for a quick lunch.  Tip: Call ahead and order for pickup!  Their customer service is impeccable! They seem to remember everyone by name! Or maybe they're just reading all of our name tags haha since the majority of their clientele are office workers."}
{"text":"It's convenient and the fresh food is good. The cooked food has no discernable spice in it.  O mean not even taco seasoning in the tacos."}
{"text":"This great little cafe is downstairs from my office building.  Perfect for when you're starving and don't have time to get out of the neighborhood.  The food is fresh, the prices are extremely fair, and the staff is super helpful.  My favorite is the California chicken wrap.  Perfectly cooked chicken breast, bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado and ranch dressing in a light tortilla. YUM!"}
{"text":"I love going to this cafe for a quick bite to eat since it is so close to my work. Prices are really inexpensive, the food is not bad, and they are quick!   I recently ordered two egg cheese sandwiches (one with bacon) and a small coffee: the price was only $9.09! It was a deal - and the sandwich was so good! As long as I work close by, I'll continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"I work just above this cafe. This a quick place to grab lunch or breakfast for a reasonable price. Daily lunch specials a plus! Wes and his crew are all very nice people. Try the honey badger wrap if it happens to be on the special menu. It is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome Ice tea. Great service. Had the turkey wrap and it was really good. They use the Boars Head line so that is a plus. You get a choice of chips or pasta salad with your sandwich or wrap. Pasta salad a bit on dry side. The prices on some of the stuff that they sell here are cheaper than the cafe at our building so that is a plus. There is plenty of seating inside and out. If you check in you get  free scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"Small cafe admist all the highrises in Uptown. Good selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. The service is super friendly too. They've got other things you may need in the office if you forgot something at home.   The 4 stars for me came from the Watermelon Nectar though. It is incredibly refreshing on a hot day. It's watermelon juice, coconut water, mint, and nectar. Also, checking in will get you a free scope of ice cream which I'm always a fan of. They had a good selection of ice cream to choose from too so it actually made for a tough decision."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat that is inexpensive and won't break the bank.  Boars head meats are a plus as well.  They even carry thrifty ice cream! !!! YUM!  good comes out fast with minimal wait.    Iced tea is amazing.  Best place in a long time to have such great tea.  I'm a fan!   The staff are pleasant as well.  Super friendly :)  This will be a good go to place for me for sure."}
{"text":"Alright place. I was disappointed today though. I got there at 10:50AM yesterday and was relieved to find out that they served breakfast until 11:00AM. She told me that they also serve breakfast again after 1PM. I really wanted a breakfast burrito today so waited until 1:15PM and headed over. I asked the guy at the register, \"you guys do breakfast after one, right?\" He shook his head and said, \"not today, we can't.\" Kind of nit picky, I know, but don't tell a customer one thing one day and then the very next day, tell them something different."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The employees are always so friendly, and my food is always made to perfection."}
