{"text":"Superb and seems to have gotten better over time . Amazing idlis. And their chilli paneer is amazing as well. Will be back"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to try south indian food and srilanka food.  Kothu is my favorite dish here and they got variety of dishes for buffet. Interior is well designed and it's  looks fresh and welcoming. The staff here is friendly and polite to customers. I guess, it's a new location and they need to do some advertising to let others know about the location. I love to dine here every weekend!!!."}
{"text":"A must place to try out if you are craving good South Indian food! 

Food wise - Everything we ordered tasted great! We got Chicken and vegetarian kothu parantha, noodles , butter chicken , vegetarian manchurian and Naan bread. The flavors and spice was right on and hit the spot! The owner brought us their speciality parantha and OMG it was so good. I could just eat the whole thing by itself , without any curry! 


Dessert- The owner brought us a complimentary dessert. It was a mixture of various cheesecakes and icecreams! Delicious ! 

Overall comments- Overall, the food is good, the  ambience is very nice,the service was good, it's a family owned restaurant so great service. The owner/server checked in with us a few times to make sure we are doing fine. I would definitely go back.

Cheers and live,laugh and love!"}

{"text":"Very authentic Indian food. Butter chicken thali came with a sampling of various sides. All food was tasty and fresh.

Service was slightly slow, but very friendly. 

Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We ordered kotu paratha and dosa combo. Every thing was really yummy! Five stars to this place."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Cochrane to try this place and we were not disappointed. I'm Sri Lankan and I know authentic, and this is the real deal. Staff were friendly too."}
{"text":"Friendly service, enjoyed the fish pakoras and butter chicken. Spicy but good flavours. Was disappointed in Hakka noodles (smelled burned). Service was slow and lighting in the restaurant was not the best (fluorescent lights)."}
{"text":"We were visiting Calgary and after a early morning flight, I really wanted to have some comfort food. This place was next to the car rental place so decided to try it. 

Fantastic food ! the flavors are great, portions are generous and super friendly staff. We ordered medu vada , masala dosa and the veggie thali. Everything tasted great. Medu vada was so fresh and perfectly crisp ! The thali's was good for the price but felt the portion for veggies, raita and other things was too small. It was served in a sauce container. Both me and my husband totally enjoyed the meal and were literally stuffed. We even got a samosa to go (3 for 5$). Excellent value for money. I will recommend this place to others !

I did not give 5 stars because 
The restrooms do not have any locks !!! Recommendation to the owner -I guess you can replace door knobs with lock once !!!"}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this place based on the reviews here. It took them 45 minutes to serve us so we devoured the food when it finally came. The dosa is really good value for the money. It's a whole meal for $6.50. That is if you don't mind a greasy dosa fried in ghee (clarified butter). 

The shrimp curry was good but the mutton curry was undercooked. It needed at least another hour of cooking. I was not impressed by the idiyappam (string hoppers) either but that's probably my bias. 

I guess once you get a hang of what to order here you will enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I am new to Indian cuisine but have had a few and this place was good. We tried the Buttered Chicken which was tasty.
My husband asked for Curry Chicken and got
Curry lamb. He didn't complain because it
was good and he likes lamb. I had Kothu Roti with Chicken and the portion was huge. I barley made a dent in it. We enjoyed everything but the service was a bit off.  The server was very nice but didn't seem experienced with getting the order wrong and we called her to the table a few times for different things...All in all a good meal and the prices were really reasonable."}
{"text":"While visiting Calgary, we got a craving for Indian food.  This place was recommended by a local, so we gave it a try.  The restaurant was in a little strip mall area along with a handful of other ethnic food places south of the airport.  We arrived for dinner at a fairly early time and there was only one other family inside.  We were greeted by very sweet and soft spoken waitress.  She assisted us with ordering our food, and we received some very tasty and filling meals.  We had excellent butter chicken, lamb curry, and a huge platter of Kothu Roti with chicken.  The food was excellent and I'm sorry to admit that we couldn't finish it all.  The prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.  The only downside is that there is no beer or wine available.  Before we left, the place started filling up with people.  Definitely recommend trying this place if you enjoy authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"We just stumbled upon this place for quick lunch. Good food great service and Thali was awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped by after getting in late from the airport. Amazing, authentic food! We ordered the butter chicken, eggplant curry and a dosa and kothu roti. Food had wonderful flavors! A lot of the dishes are great to share and the kothu roti (Roti sliced and mixed with veggies, etc) was a favorite! The service was very friendly and prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We tried the lunch buffet.  It's $12.95/person.  A good value for a buffet, in my opinion.  The buffet comes with either Masala dosa  (potato dosa / crepe) or naan (butter or plain).  We opted for 2 dosas and 2 butter naans. 

There was white basmati rice in the rice cooker being kept warm, vegetarian biryani, butter chicken, goat curry, tandoori chicken, potato curry, cabbage with some spice, dhal, chana, fresh sliced up vegetables, onion pakora, and rasam.  There were also raita, and 2 chutneys for the dosa.  For dessert, there was payasam.

All in all, the best parts of the buffet are the following:
- tandoori chicken - the most tender and moist chicken I've ever eaten
- goat curry - tender pieces of goat in a very tasty curry
- dhal - lentils cooked down - so good for you!
- dosa - filled with chunks of spiced up potatoes, eat with the 2 types of chutneys.  
- butter chicken - quite good
- payasam - dessert with tapioca pearls, ginger and a bunch of other spices.  Not too sweet but satisfying.

I just wish the buffet's temperature was a little higher as the food could've been warmer."}
{"text":"Beautifully authentic cuisine. Perfumed and delicious I had the butter chicken thali. They say they are known for their butter chicken and I have to agree. It's truly delicious and it came with great accompaniments.  Everything was very fresh. This was a very well rounded and filling meal. I highly recommend Sahana if you are looking to fulfill your craving for South Indian Flavors."}
