{"text":"It is nice that there are places like this in Illinois. It may be a bit of a hike to get here, but I see some trips in the future once the little one is old enough. This is a great place to take kids and the family for a nice day trip.   The orchard is very close off the main highway so there isn't a lot of searching and they have their own gravel lot for parking. There is no admission fee to enter or do any of the activities. We did, however, happily pay 25 cents to feed the goats, and they appreciated it very much. Aside from a few animals there are play areas for kids, mazes and they have pick your own apples. It was 9$ for a half peck bag, which was 16 small apples for us.   The items in the shop are fairly expensive compared to other similar places. Jams and jellies were between 4 and 6 a jar and their pies were 12.99. They did have an absolutely delicious apple cider slushie for 3.49 and it was totally worth it.   They do have a small restaurant that serves food for lunch and of course cider doughnuts all the time. The doughnuts were 89 cents each and I think they were about 7 a dozen, but they were fluffy and delicious."}
{"text":"Curtis Orchard is a fall staple for going pumpkin picking and buying apple doughnuts with cider. The atmosphere still feels the same to me as it did when I would come here at age 5. It's so homey and has a general happy vibe.   The reason I am rating them four stars is for two reasons:  1. Everything is pricey 2. The crowds in the small store is a nightmare when you go during the fall season. With the amount of people that go to Curtis Orchard, they should really look into expanding the store so people have room to breathe."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Curtis Orchard sells delicious food. The apples, cider, jams, jellies and so forth are great. There are some great options if you want sugar and salt free products that still taste amazing!  However, the prices are high.  If they were more reasonable I would visit much more often."}
{"text":"We used to love it here and I still think there are great aspects... but they took away a lot of the fun things for the kids to play and jump in( the hay barn) so we just do not go back as it is depressing when things go downhill for the sake of what? Maybe it is expensive to run this place and they needed to raise all their prices? But anyway..."}
{"text":"Odd experience...this is a locally owned orchard/business that has great apple cider, pumpkins and pies. The ambience is great if you like autumn in the midwest and I do. Now here is where it gets weird...just about everything but the apple products were manufactured somewhere else. I just wanted stuff made right there or at least locally or at least in the USA. Tons of stuff made in China. Worth the visit but if you go you might want to ask them about the China thing."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, I regret having one here just once while going to school here.  Actually, I went here AFTER graduation during Homecoming.  Free admission!  It's definitely a very family friendly place, but it makes a cute cheap date too.  Must get a cider donut, I guarantee you buy 1/2 -1 dozen for the trip home.  Their shop inside is humongous too, you can spend ages inside and buy some really nice gifts inside."}
{"text":"We used to come to Curtis Orchard all the time, and it was a great place to be outside, have a nice meal, and do fun activities together while being active. The $5/bag charge isn't the worst bit, it's that you can't enter the orchard without one. My partners family was in from out of town and obviously couldn't take two bags of apples home to Michigan with them (plus...Michigan apples. Why would they?!). We just wanted to pick apples together, and would have bought two bags. However, their new policy is that you must buy a bag per person in order to enter the orchard. I felt bad for the employees who had to deliver the message. Overpriced, crap policy for a place that used to be a cornerstone of community life. Protect the trees and the products, of course! But don't turn away business because of inflexible policies!!!! Why not one bag per couple? Did four adults (two of which were over 50) really pose a logical threat to your apple trees? Were we really going to climb over things and make a mess?   Overall, disappointed and won't be going back. Going to Bloomington normal from now on for u pick needs and a fun day out. The donuts are still amazing, though."}
{"text":"The fall is not complete without a couple trips to Curtis Orchard.  We usually go at least twice during the football season.    They have AMAZING apple doughnuts, a spectacular apple selection, mums, pumpkins, gourds, pies, and almost anything else you can imagine.    Sometimes we pick our own apples and other times we are in more of a time crunch.  Either way we are always pleased with the selection.   When you are in Champaign, you should find a way to work this into your visit.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was entertaining for an afternoon, but all the apples were gone by the time I got the chance to visit.  Sad.  However, the weather was still awesome enough to take a stab at their corn maze, and play with the goats.  I found all those 4 marker things and gave my filled out sheet to a little girl who was looking longingly at the blow-up slide. =)  I guess I was expecting a lot more because my friends all rave about this place.  True, their store and variety of jams and goodies was pretty neat, but $9 for a little baggie for apples?  No thanks.  Actually, everything there I would say was overpriced.  It was worth going the once to say I did it, but as for going back again?  Ehhh... maybe next year...."}
{"text":"My family was in town for a football game, and we went here to pick apples.  We had a great time.  The apples were plentiful and there were several varieties we could choose to pick.  The only weird thing is that they tell you not to eat any apples without washing them.  What kind of orchard frowns upon sampling the apples as you pick?    The store is very cute and the little cafe served cinnamon donuts that were delicious.  The live music outside gave the whole place a festive atmosphere, and it looked like there was lots of activities for little kids.    I hope to go back every Fall."}
{"text":"Its a great place to take your kids. They learn about how fruits grow. My daughters enjoyed picking apples and it is not pricey as well. It can be crowded sometimes but it is fine if you plan to go to the orchard. There are some other kids activities (like pony riding) that get affected by the crowds."}
{"text":"Oh Curtis Orchard, you are now a \"sell out\"  As nearly all of the farmland around them is now developed, maybe this has been a necessity.  Who knows, but it makes me really sad.  Went this weekend...1/2 peck u-Pick is now $9?  That's Chicago style pricing.  I know they have to make a living, and I am glad that people support local food, but I am now on the search for another mom and pop apple orchard that makes their own stuff (not packaged for...)  This weekend they had price stickers on zucchini and other food.  $1.60 for a zucchini.  I guess Curtis is now the sheek place to go. It makes me sad...I bought my 2 bushels and came home.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Plenty of activities for kids and adults. They have a store with apples, apple donuts, pies, popcorn and other apple related goods. Store seems to have expanded since I was there last Autumn. A fun place to go for pick your own pumpkin!"}
{"text":"This place is always good, and super crowded, esp. on weekends when the Fall hits.  Apples, cider, and doughnuts are all excellent, though somewhat expensive.  During the fall there is a cafe that serves hot dogs and the like, and often outdoor bbq stands with pork chop sandwiches, which I enjoy getting.  The place does a booming business.  I hope the feeling of the area won't change too much now that an interstate interchange and its attendent retail/commercial development will be a stone's throw away!"}
{"text":"MAJOR disappointment.  It seems that each time I've visited this place it gets worse.  I honestly can't understand why people go there and especially bring their kids.  The playground \"apparatus\" is filthy and in disrepair.  I didn't want my grandkids touching much of anything. One play area is free and another is for \"Paying Customers,\"  people foolish enjoy to buy tokens to gain entry. Duh?  The so-called miniature golf is a joke and costs you money.   At least today the poor ponies/horses that walk in circles were spared that indignity.  The Flying Monkey Cafe is a rip-off, selling substandard food at quality prices.  The famous cider has declined over time while its cost has risen.  The donuts are still okay but not for the price.  Apple fritters are great but also pricy.  They have expanded the shop and everything in it -- toys, foodstuff, etc. -- is over-priced.  $10 for a bag of chocolate covered pretzels?  So many things looked or sounded good until one looked at the price.  Give me a break.  I'm far from being a tightwad but I draw the line at being ripped off.  $3.49 for a caramel apple that most of the caramel stuck to the wrapping and the apple was a soggy mess.  The ones at Schnuck's are vastly superior and this is an apple orchard.  Feed the goats?  For 25 cents you get a few pellets of feed if you're lucky, or none if you're not.  Two wash stations exhort you to wash up after feeding the animals but provided no water.  At every turn, this place offered one disappointment after another.  The more this place has expanded over time, the worse it has become.  It seems that they have spread themselves too thin to adequately maintain the facilities and have be coasting along on their past reputation to bring in customers, although that reputation has long since been tarnished.  How very sad.  Sadder still is the fact that people patronize it blindly, giving them no incentive to make improvements or offer reasonable prices.  Goodbye, Curtis Orchard & Pumpkin Patch, not everyone is gullible.  By the way, I just saw a coupon for Curtis offering $5 off for a $20 day pass.  Day pass??  To what??  Dirty and dilapidated playground equipment?  A joke of a miniature golf course?  Folks, they should be paying us money to even go there.  Seriously, if you don't believe me, go ahead and waste an afternoon there and tell me I don't speak the truth."}
{"text":"I have been here many times.  The kids love it and they do not charge to get in.  However, they basically charge for everything else.   There are your basic pumpkin patch staples like a corn maze and a tour of the pumpkin patch.  They also have face painting, pony rides, inflatables (2), playground, mini golf, a barn with a hay loft the kids can jump out of.  Also kettle corn cooked outside and a bluegrass band playing.  The inflatables were very frustrating to me because they only let one child through the obstacle course at a time.  The person overseeing it is a kid probably in high school.  We waited and waited for the little kid who went in front of my daughter to get done.  He seemed to have disappeared.  Everyone just stood there and did nothing to encourage the child to come out.  I would say we waited for 10 to 15 minutes before the grandmother finally decided to go see where he was.  What I am getting at here is that the person supervising the inflatable should have had more of a backbone and spoke up to the Grandmother or the child so the other kids did not have to wait such a long time. Thankfully my daughter had way more patience then I did because I was fuming.  This was the first time I ate of the Flying Monkey.  The line was long and it went slow.  But, it was worth it.  The green beans were really good.  I wish I knew what they put in them.  I also had the Au gratin potatoes and I personally like them.  They were fresh and not greasy.  I overheard someone say that the chili was the best chili they have ever had.  I did not try it.  Everything looked good to me.    The apple donuts are good but not my thing.  They are about $10 per dozen which marks them expensive in my book.  The cider is $8 a gallon.    I did not pick apples or pumpkins so I can not comment on those aspects of the orchard.  But all in all I really enjoyed our time spent here and I thought the food was good."}
{"text":"Busy on weekends with ppl of all ages and ethnic groups. Kid friendly. Pricey rides, kettle corn, food, and store products. The hot and canned foods are delish - and the apples, peaches are awesome everytime. The kids enjoy the rides and bouncy patch.  2-yr olds are free to enjoy all! The tractor ride tour of the grounds is rather lame but is an opportunity to sit and take a short ride to the pumpkin patch. Music may be provided during the weekend afternoons, which is nice.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I had a really nice time when I recently visited this place. I purchased some of the delicious apple cider to enjoy at home. The air smelled truly delicious outside."}
{"text":"Cool place. Fun to go to. Great for kids and family. Amazing donuts and caramel apples! If you have nothing to do one day, stop by. It never gets boring here."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  Maybe it's worth the premium if you have kids, but I can't get on board.  A pumpkin that costs $4 at Meijer is $16.  A $5 gallon of cider is $9.  I used to work at farmer's markets in heavily gentrified areas of Baltimore and Washington DC and people would have laughed in my face if I tried to charge this much.  The apple doughnuts were the only thing I found worthwhile."}
{"text":"I LOVE Curtis Orchards...and after spending $39.95 at Apple Holler, $9 a 1/2 peck sounds JUST fine.  The apples are good quality and the place isn't totally picked over.  I had a great time here and love Champaign...would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A massively commercialized \"farm\" experience, but what the hell?  It's pretty damn fun.  You get to pick some apples, pet a goat, find a pumpkin, wander a corn maze, eat some AMAZING fresh hot apple donuts, grab some soybeans, or frolic amongst the squash--ALL AT ONCE.  I liked it.  It was cheesy and a bit cliche, and the people that were visiting were as much farmers as I (a Los Angeles transplant) am.  But that's alright.  I spotted everyone from a nun to a group of African international students to a Chicago businessman in the cafe eating those delicious donuts."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place we have in here C-U. There's something here for the whole family. They have a nice area for you to be able to feed the goats which is always fun, and there are multiple spots set up for some great pictures.   They have their general store that offers a wide variety of food and craft items where you can stock up on apple cider donuts or even some corn salsa. There's so much available, it's great.   Last time we were we here picked apples. They've changed the process and make every person going into the orchard pay for a bag to put their apples in, and the bags are smaller than they were in previous years. It's still a good deal though overall though. You really can't beat apples picked right off the tree, so good.   Overall, Curtis Orchard is a great place to spend some time at with friends or family. With everything that they have to offer, everyone is sure to have a good time."}
{"text":"Were back this past weekend-- first time in YEARS-- and the place is still just as lovely (but OMG, so much HUGER!!) as always.  Watched my little niece as she fed the goats, played with other kids, and pretty much enjoyed every single piece of playground equipment, then a whole pile of pumpkins, before we spoiled the heck out of her with stuffed animals!    I'm revising my earlier comment about the store being heavily overpriced.  We got two of the CUTEST stuffed animals (one of them a Gund Teddybear) for such great prices.  A fox, named Sophia, had a hole big enough to put your finger in, but she was just too precious not to buy.  They offered to replace it for us once they got their new shipment in!  That's right!  They let her keep it (I bought it, of course), and are going to replace it for her in under a week.  I thought that was tremendously generous!  On top of it, the woman who made such decisions was gone at the time (when I went through the line), but the staff at the cash register got with her upon her return, found us on the farm, and took our details so they could let us know when new Sophia's were in!  Spectacular service!  After a hot few hours, we all sat around a huge table, refreshments in hand (again, very affordable), in a half-darkened (by our choice, they offered to turn on the lights) part of the restaurant, and laughed and gabbed the afternoon away.  All in all, what a lovely trip it was with family and friends in such a special place!"}
{"text":"Oh, Curtis Orchard.  This place, in many ways, defines \"home\" for me.  I bought every Halloween pumpkin here as a child, can remember preschool \"field trips\" to watch in awe as they made their old-fashioned donuts, sat with the inevitable litter of kittens while I sucked down my cider slushie.... memories.  It's a great place for a family trip, so amazingly kid-friendly in so many ways.  Loving the new(er) additions of the petting zoo, maze, playground, enlarged store area... yeah, it was just a tiny little building in my childhood memories.  Anyway, it's a wonderful way to spend an hour (or three) with the family.  Get a donut and a cider slushie, at the very least."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I go at least once a week to get donuts and an Italian Beef sandwich at the Flying Monkey Cafe."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced with not much to do. It one token to go down a large inflatable slide. Each token is one dollar. Some of the activities are as much as 3 or 4 dollars. The sign said that every person that does the you pick apples needs to pay $5 to go into the orchard. We only want one half peck of apples. We don't eat more then that before they are bad but didn't want to pay $20 to pick 1/2 a peck. In fact it cost $.25 to watch a toy train make a loop around the room. I will not be back. I can drive to Bloomington Normal and take the kids to Rader Family Farm for less money and a ton more activities. Or drive another hour to tanners orchard to another place with way more activity and better food products and apples."}
{"text":"There may not be that much to do at Curtis Orchard, but it sure is nice to be there for awhile. Especially when it's a crisp fall day.   They are open in July for apple picking... the rows of trees feel endless! Over 25 types of apples that are ripe during different times of the year. The pumpkins don't come until Fall... and even though they're overpriced -- you're paying for the experience. Go on, act like a kid again - jump in the pile of hay, pet and feed a goat, buy some kettle cooked popcorn, eat a few apple doughnuts and run around like there's no tomorrow. And if you're feeling really naughty: Pick an apple, don't pay for it and throw the core on the ground.  The staff members hand out a schedule of which ones are ready to pick and you can choose your own. Or grab a bag of pre-picked apples in their store, but where's the fun in that?"}
{"text":"Curtis orchard is a special place in the community. It's the staple of fall and the season of pumpkins and colorful leaves. Everyone who works at the orchard are extremely nice, and the activities for kids is quite impressive!"}
{"text":"We've been going here every year for the past 10 years with our children. It's become a tradition that my 10 year old looks forward to every year. The highlight is the Upick. I enjoyed walking the orchard carefree, having fun choosing the best apples for our bag. I've always had a great experience. But, this year they have a guard on a golf cart riding up and down the orchard paths watching for people eating apples. I can understand not wanting the customers to eat apples while picking, but to stop and accuse my 1 year old son of 'stealing' because he picked an apple of the ground and took a bite. This doesn't reflect the family atmosphere I've come to expect from the orchard. Even my ten year old was upset by this and wanted to leave. I made a complaint to management. He was friendly and gracious about it, and gave my one year old a free slushie. It was appreciated, but I dont think we will be doing any U-picking under these circumstances.  Other than that, everything else I like. There's a nice play area for toddlers and the wagon ride is always fun. I always buy tons of Honeycrisp apples and salsa."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. I came with my girlfriend, brother, and mom. We did the 'U pick' and picked from the 3 types of apples they had available. The store inside is really cool too. Lots of preserves, mixes, etc to choose from that they make. The staff was really friendly too and prices are affordable. The petting area and moon bounce are good for kids."}
{"text":"Love going here to pick apples and get cider! The apple donuts are really really good! Those go so fast in my home!"}
{"text":"I enjoy going here once and awhile but honestly, I think this place is more for young kids. The ambiance is pretty hokey. And it can get really crowded with terrible lines. The price of the apples is ridiculous, especially for picking apples. For about a large ziplock bag full, it costs $10! And the apples are covered with pesticides. That being said, it's kind of a \"fun\" place. I can't comment on the food here because I don't eat it (I have Celiac Disease and cannot have anything with gluten) although before I was diagnosed, I remember the doughnuts were quite tasty. I think I'll be going out to Wolfe Apple Orchard in Montecello in the future, even though it's a bit further of a drive."}
{"text":"Tip: Don't go pumpkin picking when it's over 80 degrees! This fun outing turned into slave labor very quickly. The urge to sing spirituals was overwhelming.  Grab a rickety red wagon and walk the dirt path out to the pumpkin patch and pick your pumpkin baby. It's dusty and dirty so leave your fancy duds at home. Most of the pumpkins were easy to remove from the vines but some of them required a bit of tugging and yanking so I suggest bringing a pocket knife or Wolverine.  In addition to pumpkins you can get all sorts of gourds for eating or decorating and they have some pretty strange shapes. Let's just say we giggled like 12 year olds at certain shapes. I know, I know, grow up!  Other Highlights: Apple donuts are the shizz! Giant sized rocking chair makes a great photo prop once you're able to push the families and kids out of the way.  No so high lights: Lines can get crazy and they move like molasses Pricing for some of the items in the store are insane and laughable. The dirty pumpkin washing basin, no way to keep it clean of course but I still don't like it."}
{"text":"HONEYCRISP WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!! Seriously these are really good! And the apple donuts? Good enough to start a fight over.  These is a great orchard close to the UIUC campus. Lots of fun activities for kids too (hay rides, mazes, etc) but the apples are where its at. Everytime I'm down there its a must visit."}
{"text":"This will always be a special orchard and patch for me.  My family used to take us apple picking when we were just wee little things.  But this was the first orchard I'd developed a relationship with on my own.  Kinda like my own autumn haven when I was in college -- acres of trees away from campus with the sweet smells of apple and spices in the crisp autumn air...ahhh....  The fact that its a dual apple and pumpkin one-stop-shop rules.  And I'm a sucker for u-pick, so none of that off-the-shelf stuff for me.  I like to stretch and toil and twist and cut to get the luscious, crisp apples and plump, thorny pumpkins!  Although I admit even pre-picked items here are pretty good if you come too late in the season to pick.  It's way better than the mealy dealies in the groceries, that's for sure!  But Curtis is more than just the pickin'.  Its little shop is so homey and quaint and the Wizard of Oz themes bring me back home.  They've got great comfort food and baked goodies (fresh apple-cinnamon donuts that you can watch through a window being made by the donut machine!) as well as all sorts of preserves, butters and knick-knacks you can take home.  This is where I first tasted apple butter.  And man, do I love it....  Take some time, even if you're an adult, to go through the maze or the giant slide (I guarantee you'll want one in your back yard!) and watch the goats at play.  You'll feel much better for it, trust me.  Makes me feel like a kid again.  Like fresh apple butter on warm cinnamon toast, Curtis Orchard is a choice kiss for autumn!"}
{"text":"You know.....maybe I just don't go apple picking often enough, but $9 for a bag of apples seems a little steep, don't you think?  It was actually something like fifty cents cheaper to buy pre-picked, pre-bagged apples.  Why does my labor cost me more money than their labor?  So weird.  Anyway.  Curtis Orchard is a very pleasant experience overall.  It was a beautfiul autumn day, and while it was busy, the orchard is huge, which allows for avoiding human interaction.  Most of the people were out in the pumpkin patch, anyway.  The apples wound up being very tart and delicious, but it was kind of arduous finding ones that weren't horribly misfigured (in a scary way) by hail damage.    I think what would merit another go-round is the store.  Cider donughts!  Various fruit butters!  Many flavors of pasta!  Syrups!  Pickled bloody mary goods!  I was in food accessory heaven, friends.  That alone is a reason to visit."}
{"text":"Okay, central IL needs an apple orchard and this is one.  So that is why I'm giving 2 stars.  Unfortunately, I can't stand it when places \"sell out\" and I'm sad to say this has occurred here.  The first time I visited Curtis was a weekday morning with my 5 month old and it was lovely.  There were kittens wandering around and baby swings.  Mind you, during this first visit I actually didn't venture any farther than the \"Three Billy Goats Gruff Bridge\".  I continued to visit once or twice a season since then and now its been 3 years.  Gradually it has sickened me more and more each and every visit.  And 2 weeks ago, I just couldn't believe what I saw:  A noisy, junky trailer set up by the goat bridge that offers the opportunity to \"sluice mine\" sorting a bucket of rocks for $5.  Two gigantic inflatable things hiding the apples trees that kids can waste $1 per jump.  U-Pick now costs by the bag, not the pound - and its $9 per bag!  We are not talking big bags here, its the size of gallon ziploc.  Let alone the apple juice they pass off as apple cider.    The whole experience is just a money-making gimmick.  Its sad."}
{"text":"My family and I got to pick our own Ginger Gold and William's Pride apples today. The price was $10 for a U-pick bag or $9 each for two or more bags. We were also able to sample the apples so we could pick which apple we would like to pick more off. I thought that was very nice of them to offer samples. There is also a small petting zoo with a miniature horse and some goats and chickens. I would absolutely love to come back and pick apples here next year. It was not crowded at all. The apples are delicious!"}
{"text":"Yes it's pricey, so coming here to pick pumpkins or apples probably will not be your new weekly ritual. But if you have kids or just want to go in a casual outdoors date with activities, Curtis Orchard is a great option. Make sure to try the apple cider and apple doughnuts (only fresh and hot, they lose all their flavor after cooling down). Both are addictive."}
{"text":"Looking for ssomething to do in Urbana-Champaign in the fall?  Pick some apples...pick a pumpkin...HUGE orchard and patch. A few activities for kids such as playground, there is also a corn maze. Drink delicious apple cider and eat phenomenal apple donuts."}
{"text":"This place was an amazing slice of hometown autumn joy when I was a child. I visited Curtis Orchard for the first time in over a decade a few weekends ago..... and I am sad to say that this place has taken a turn for the worse. What happened?!?!????? It has turned into an over-commercialized sorry excuse for a pumpkin patch. The children attractions are gimmicky and over priced. The donuts are dry and lack a decent coating of cinnamon sugar that they once had. They even put a quarter machine on the little train that travels around the ceiling of the store dining area.... that thing used to travel around the entire store for free, NO MONEY REQUIRED!!!! Shame on the owners and what they have let it become."}
{"text":"awesome doughnuts & apple cider."}
{"text":"Curtis Orchard is a traditional autumn activity for me.  Much of the decorations are incredibly cheesy (with a Wizard of Oz theme), and I have to agree with other reviewers who complain that the crowds here are enough to give anyone claustrophobia.  Still, I see so many carefree smiles that it's hard not to get caught up in the positive energy.  Check out the orchard website to see if your favorite type of apple is in season.  Fruit-picking can be a fun activity, but at Curtis, it's probably reserved for the wealthy ($9 for a 1/2 peck!?).  I really wish they would sell smaller bags, because I'm usually sick of apples a week later.  During my visits, I tend to spend more time in the gift shop than out with the apples.  For tourists, this is a great place to pick up a non-Illini-themed souvenir to remind you of Champaign.  Many of the items keep with the whole country theme (comfort food cookbooks, home decorations, etc.).  Being a family attraction, they've also got lots of neat, traditional children's stuff, like wooden toys, plastic animals, and prop sets for playing \"pretend\" games.    In terms of food, they're stocked with pies, apple donuts, and cider.  The popularity of these items is so obvious; you can buy single donuts and fritters at the check-out registers.  One aisle is all jarred pantry items: jellies, preserves, pickles, and salsas.  They've got special cases so that you can mix-and-match your favorite jarred items to make a gift set for friends.  At their Flying Monkey Cafe, you can grab a quick meal from a cafeteria-style line.  Most of it is American home-cooking, with barbecue, casseroles, and pie.  Nothing really stands out as amazing, but I would caution to stay away from the au gratin potatoes (they taste like they were made from a box, but under-flavored and greasier).  The price of combination platters range from $6 to $10, kind of high for the quality (I guess attractions never have cheap food, even out in Champaign)."}
{"text":"Cool place. Fun activity for the family.  Face painting was enjoyable my 4 year old.  The bouncy house lines were disappointing, not really set up for multiple kids at the same time, poor flow. There is lots to do for kids, but my son seemed to get bored with the activities much quicker than other places.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Apple Doughnuts.  If that doesn't make you go then there are Honey Crisp Apples, Pumpkins, handmade jams and cider.  And then, there's pie!  It is a fun place for adults and the kids I have seen there seem to be LOVING it!  Give it a try before or after a football game."}
{"text":"Admittedly, this displaced Socal girl wouldn't have thought going to an apple orchard would be \"fun,\" but Curtis Orchard is definitely a cute place =) (that, or the Midwest is slowwlllyyy growing on me ;))  Think wholesome, family/date-friendly (a la Disney) little apple orchard complete with Wizard-of-Oz theme, petting zoo, hay mazes, face painting, and at this time of year, a pumpkin patch!  Oh, and of course the requisite shop and cafe with their (expensive) produce...perhaps I should mention that this place IS a wee bit commercialized (also like Disney, ha!). Didn't get to pick any of their famous (-ly expensive?) apples this past blustery Sunday, but did procure a few very impressive pumpkins and a gallon of their fresh apple cider.  I do want to go back and try out their apples at some point (and eat more of their godly apple donuts), but until then, can't wait for a night of pumpkin carving and (spiked ;)) spiced apple cider!"}
{"text":"This small town orchard has really expanded! In addition to apples and peaches and pumpkins (oh my!) there's a petting booth, a gift shop, a cafe, and pony rides.  I love the honey and local jams that Curtis Orchards sells, and it isn't fall if I can't buy apple cider.  This is a great place to spend a couple of hours with the kids and have some delicious treats. Be sure to visit in the fall!"}
{"text":"I live about 45 miles away from Curtis Orchard but really didn't discover it until my daughter had my first grandchild.  She lived about 45 miles the other way and we met in the middle at the Orchard for my grandson's first visit.  Since then going to Curtis Orchard is a MUST HAVE in the fall - we have been going for nine years now!!    They have evolved over the years from a plain orchard and pumpkin patch to a fun and accessible destination.  They offer pumpkins already picked to choose from in the front OR you can walk back to the patch, pulling the provided wagons, and pick out one for yourself.  The walk is fun, and the kids love roaming around the patch (yes, she added a granddaughter a few years later).  Once the perfect pumpkin is located, the kids love to \"wash\" it off in the provided troughs of water.    Then the fun begins for Grandma - they have a lovely store with lots of cooking accessories, kids items, decorative items and the best thing of all - home made apple/cinnamon donuts!  They have a cafe that has expanded in the last few years with a great food menu.  I love the BBQ.  They have home made pies, cobblers, caramel apples.  You can eat these things there or you can take them home.  I think I made three trips over this year and got the donuts and pies (those come either baked or frozen to be baked at a later time) for everyone in the family.    For the kids, on the weekends, they offer a large play area, petting zoo, pony rides, balloon slides and bouncy houses...I'm sure I missed something because the kids love to play and are all over the place.  They also offer a hayride that is totally safe.  They go through the orchards, out to the pumpkin patch and back and that is also a must have.    This year I found out something I didn't know - that they offer guided trips for schools.  I went over with the grandkids classes to visit and got a behind the scenes look at how the apples are harvested, washed and pressed for cider, as well as a great presentation on how bees are a vital part of the apple's life.    I can't say enough good about the Orchard.  I haven't ever tried to pick the apples as I always pick up a bag of honeycrisp that they have picked and are for sale in the gift shop, but I know that is available.  We look forward to our trip there every year and will definitely be going back.  Best pumpkin patch in Central Illinois!"}
{"text":"We used to come to Curtis Orchard sometimes. The $5/bag charge isn't the worst bit, it's that you can't enter the orchard without one. I visited today on weekday with family of five and paid $20..but the worst part was there were no apples left on the tree to pick.   The girl on the counter told us \"tough luck\" as all the people visiting during Columbus day long weekend might have picked it all.. sorry you will have to give us $20.. take some rotten apples lying on the ground."}
{"text":"I wasn't wearing cutoff shorts and a wifebeater and therefore was completely overdressed.  The apples cost too much (the pick your own is highway robbery!). The cider is overpriced and mediocre and the doughnuts are fine.    If you're going to make a day of it, drive up west 1 hour and north another 2 hours to find several classier orchards."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I grew up in the area, so I have many fond memories of coming here, particularly in my preschool years.  Sure, it's a bit gimmicky with things like the Wizard of Oz theme for kids, but I think that's half the appeal for me! If you come to pick apples, make sure you consult the website (it's listed above) to know when the ones you want will be in season.  This way, you can time your visit to be sure you get apples - I learned this the hard way.  Come here on a warm day and spend time wandering the pumpkin patch or the rows of apple trees and pick out some things to take home.  I enjoy perusing the aisles of the shop for things to pick up - their black bean salsa is absolutely DIVINE.  Also, the apple cider donuts are great, as many others have said.  The Flying Monkey Cafe is also really great - if you can survive the long lines during the months when it's open, which are different than the Orchard's operating months.  It's a bit pricey, but the BBQ Brisket sandwich with scalloped potatoes and applesauce was totally worth every penny and the wait.  This is definitely a staple activity for me once Fall hits.  I enjoy going with my friends and checking out the sights, which is how I think it's best experienced.  If you're in the area, check it out if you can - there's even an exit on I-57 straight to Curtis Road to make it even easier to get there!"}
{"text":"Landmark review: It only took 1 year before I got to experience Curtis Orchard. I can see why so many people are fans of this place. Unlikely many other attractions where you have to pay money for admission and more money for activities, they allow you to explore for free and you only pay for what you buy or play. My son enjoyed the pony rides 5 dollars, playground free, and the giant slide 1 dollar. You can actually get an all day pass for 25 dollars as well. (Play-All-Day Wristbands - $25 each (includes two pony rides, five rounds in the Wicked Orchard Shoot-Out, and unlimited play on all other activities).  Does not include face painting or Wayne's Kettle Korn.  The purchase of a child's wristband includes a free wristband for one adult.) There are a lot of other activities as well including a corn maze, obstacle course, and wagon ride. For the little ones it was nice to pick and chose which ones he wanted to go. The other major highlight is picking your own pumpkin or going into the apple orchard to pick apples. We did not do this during our visit. Finally the store has everything from apple cider to apple cider donuts. Expensive, but tasty!  Hidden deals: Get the fresh bags of imperfect apple cider donuts. They really look the same, but they come in a bag and are simply delicious."}
{"text":"If you would've asked me to rate this place when I was in high school, or before that, it would've gotten 5 stars, hands down.  But now, it's overly corporate and maxed out. Every time I go there in the fall, it's completely packed and almost unbearable. I miss the days when the old-school donut maker was there with just a few simple picnic benches. Now they have a full lunch-bar and cafeteria-like room. Then of course there's the rest of the property, which is updated and completely unrecognizable to those of us who had such nostalgic, childhood ties to it.  That being said, I still have a strong emotional attachment to the place. Above all, they still manage to crank out some awesome apple cider, apple donuts, honey, and other produce. I also go there to pick pumpkins if I'm ever in town around Halloween. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Curtis Orchard's one of the most illuminating examples of capitalism from top to bottom, its systematic enterprise propelled by social media and reduced to a simplistic, romanticized image of a farm through word of mouth.   That said, it's a great place for kids with lots of activities for them to do-- from slides to riding on the back of little ponies, feeding goats and rolling around in the pumpkin patch-- as long as their parents are willing to spend the dough (the costs have already been mentioned by several reviews). I was also a little disappointed by the deceptive apple donuts, which despite its popularity, breaks down to fresh fried dough dipped in sugar with a sour apple aftertaste."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, it's a nice fun place to spend an afternoon in. Picking fruit or pumpkins is fun if you're with family or a couple friends and the food items are quite addictive, especially their donuts."}
