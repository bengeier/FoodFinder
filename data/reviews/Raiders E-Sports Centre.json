{"text":"I have been here before and the bartenders are friendly and welcoming. However,  the Asian bartender was more interested in browsing Tinder and worrying about potential dater's teeth   then following through with her basic bartender responsibilities.( not the first time)  Trying to be patient and understanding, until I realized I was still neglected for an uncomfortable  long period of time with only 4 other customers in this huge place. This place won't last long while this bartender's interests triumph the service of customers or dragging down the bottom line of the organization.  Hard days work will not  be   rewarded or recognized  with neglectful service for the butter on their bread. Soft Skills that can't be taught. Customers  were more like a chore. Shame they hired a bartender who won't emulate   or closely resemble  the service she promised. Place has seemed to lose morale and  solicitously empty when she is on shift. Gives the bar and other hard working bartender's a bad name and potential unemployment.  May seem to be a correlation to the service on that particular shift .Opportunistic area to strive unfortunately poor service will be their demise.  If you do come for a drink.. word of advice, your time will be taken for granted and not appreciated or reciprocated.   She is a poor representative of the organization that can easily be quantified by the sales on a particular shift. Could increase sales if clients were a priority rather than her egocentric  focus on dating. To bad it was  an extremely poor experience which is  evident especially with a sales pitch that can attract a modern demographic. Hope Tindering on company's time is worth it. Won't be back. Your money is worth more than what you will get in return with her."}

{"text":"I stopped in last night thinking Sports Center Cafe was still open.  This place was empty except for the few people playing video games in the back area.  What a horrible business model.  No sporting events where showing on their TV sets. Just a bunch of guys watching other guys play video games. Pure sausage party going on.  Do they expect to survive by having patrons walk in and watch people play Medal of Honor while they have a meal? This place will be out of business in 6 months. Mark my word."}
{"text":"Great cozy atmosphere and an excellent tap list.  The dudes running this place are also super chill.  Service was top notch and they look to have some interesting stuff in the works as they were infusing various spirits for experiemental cocktails.  Very promising and a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I visited here to check out the place before an event. The venue is centrally located by the subway and there is plenty of parking around. Upon entering, the front area looks like any other bar. The staff were friendly and served me some water while waiting for the owner.  Once the owner arrived, he gave me a tour around. The middle section has some nice gaming chairs and there was a board game night going on when I was there. There were also a few gaming consoles around this area as well. Further back, it was a deep pit where a basketball court was previously housed but now, it can be used as a spectator pit for live gaming with the huge TVs around.  In a hidden area, there were a few gaming computers for those who like to play League of Legends or Overwatch. I can`t wait to return for the event."}
{"text":"Great location and easy to get to and from via transit.  Great staff will to go above and beyond. Great setup for all your gaming desires.  Great food and drink made with care.  What more do you need? GO NOW OR GET REKT!!! ;)"}
{"text":"These stars are for Jade! For being an awesome and hard working server in a huge place w lots of people and she's the only one. BTW the red bean balls are SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for a party of 20+ on a Saturday night. Place wasn't busy at all.  Place was pretty clean, they cleared our plates and drinks quick too.  Management here was great - I had plenty of questions I had before booking for the party here and they gave me quick and detailed responses via their Facebook page. Told me about how renting the computers worked out, the rates for individuals and specials for it I rented out a batch of computers. When I came by to make the deposit of the party, they even provided me with a menu to take home to send to my guests so they know what's available. Also, when we arrived - I saw that there were balloons up in the reserved area which management had provided for us free of charge! At the end of the night, they even followed up and messaged me and thanking us for coming and they would appreciate any feedback from our guests. Rarely do we ever get any service like this.  The staff were very friendly and personable. Food was good. Note: Nacho's is an individual serving - not those massive trays that you would expect, so it's good for one person. My friends and I also ordered fish and chips + poutine + caesars (the caesar here is pretty good!). All the food here was good - not amazing but good; I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Raiders E-Sports Centre.  It's a restaurant/bar catering to e-sports connaisseurs.  I'm not into gaming but thought I'd check it out as it's a restaurant I haven't been to.  I ordered a Diet Coke.  It was basically brown-coloured water and no taste so I asked for a water instead.  I ordered a Chicken Club Sandwich.  I asked for mashed potatoes instead of French fries.   When my meal arrived, there were mashed potatoes but they were smothered in gravy (which I hadn't asked for).  The mashed potatoes were okay but cold and the gravy was lukewarm.  The bread on the sandwich was barely toasted and there was no mayo.  When I asked my server for a side of mayo and told her there was none on the sandwich, she seemed surprised that I want it.  She brought me a small container of mayo.  It looked and tasted funny so I used the excess gravy to make the sandwich less dry instead.  I also had to ask for pepper and salt (there were none on the tables).  When my bill came, I saw that I'd been charged $2 for swapping fries for mashed potatoes but I hadn't been told there'd be a surcharge ... the potatoes weren't worth the extra $2.  Though my server was pleasant, she seemed to be new, like it was her first day on the job.  I won't be back."}
{"text":".. I was Expecting great reviews! I guess it's what happens when a place first starts up. Regardless, I think its a great idea! There is no other place like this in Toronto (that I know of), great gaming, great atmosphere. If I could make a request, it'd be that this place sets up xbox/ps4 console tournaments like they have in Minneapolis... I miss my MLG days... Oh and after reading the comments below I feel I should mention that while it wasn't crowded to the door the place was fairly busy, and the staff seemed courteous and fairly quick service despite the volume."}
